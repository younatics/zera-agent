"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China opened the 29th Olympic Games on Friday with stunning fireworks as the Asian nation kicked off one of the most heavily scrutinized games in history. Drummers perform at the Opening Ceremony of the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, China. Fireworks shot off across the Chinese capital as hundreds of drummers and dancers performed under a light display at the National Stadium, drawing applause from the estimated 90,000 in attendance. It was a stunning beginning from the nation of 1.3 billion people. Media observers said they believe the opening ceremony will be the single most watched television event in history. Billions of dollars in the making, the Summer Olympics carry with them the ambitions of a nation seeking its place as a global superpower. The anticipation over the Olympics was unmistakable in China's capital city. The Olympic torch relay, the focus of protests during parts of its international leg earlier this year, will conclude at 11:30 p.m. local time (11:30 a.m. ET) when it enters National Stadium to light the Olympic cauldron. ""This one, I think, is going to be bigger and more spectacular ... not necessarily more surprising, but more impressive, I think, than any previous ceremony,"" said Ric Birch, who oversaw Olympic productions in 1984, 1992 and 2000.  Watch Birch assess Beijing's preparations » . In short, it's just what China wanted -- an opening ceremony with an impressive guest list. President Bush is among more than 100 heads of state, heads of government and sovereigns expected to attend, the International Olympic Committee said. The leaders represent countries including Japan, Russia, Australia, South Korea and Brazil. But this version of the Olympics brings with it controversy, discord that began in 2001 when Beijing won the games. Criticism over China's human rights record, its policies in Tibet and the persistent pollution across the country have been the focus of much international criticism and media attention. The head of the Australian Olympic Committee complained Friday about pollution as well as Internet access and uncomfortable transportation for his country's athletes to venues, according to news reports. For some world leaders, the decision to attend was a tough call. French President Nicholas Sarkozy threatened to boycott the games because of human rights abuses in Tibet but later changed his mind.  Watch protests in Germany over China's Tibet policies » . And while he has steadfastly said he would attend the Olympics opening, Bush as recently as Friday stressed China's need to respect human rights. ""It's inevitable that people from different countries may not see eye to eye,"" Chinese President Hu Jintao said recently, ""so we should try to expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect."" Political leaders do not attend Olympic opening ceremonies as a matter of protocol -- Bush is the first American president to attend them outside the United States -- but China seemed determined to have as many there as possible, taking it as a sign the world recognizes the legitimacy of the Chinese government. ""They want those leaders to confirm the fact that China has returned to great power, prominence in the world,"" said David Zweig, a political analyst at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ""They really want to say to the people of China that we, the Communist Party of China, have done a great job.""  Watch why China has invested so much in the Olympics » . Air China suspended some flights from Japan to China on Friday after receiving a bomb threat via e-mail, Japan's Transport Ministry said. The e-mail said the threat was intended to disrupt the Olympics, according to Fumio Yasukawa, a ministry representative. Many mysteries about the opening ceremony remain, like which athletes will run the final legs of the torch relay and the tightly kept secret of who will light the Olympic cauldron at the stadium. Blog: Anticipation builds . Early favorites such as national sports stars Yao Ming and Liu Xiang were widely discounted because they already had carried the torch during the relay. Many observers speculated that the person lighting the Olympic cauldron would be connected to the devastating May earthquake in China that claimed nearly 70,000 lives. As for the games, an estimated 10,000 athletes from 205 countries will compete in 28 events for about 300 gold medals. The first medals will be awarded Saturday.  See a timeline of moments to watch for at the games » . China has put a priority on finishing first in the overall medal standings. On Sunday, swimming competition begins, along with U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps' quest to win eight gold medals -- more than any individual in a single games. Even if he fails, Phelps could become the all-time leader in gold medals.  Watch how pressure is building for the athletes » . The competition -- 17 days in length -- will be a relative blip compared to the years of preparation that went into bringing the games to Beijing. China means it to be a coming-out party. Like many parties, Chinese leaders won't know how it went until it's time to clean up.

"(CNN) -- You got to give the people, now . Give the people what they want . -- The O'Jays . Now that Republicans have control of both houses of Congress, they are going to have to do better -- and do right by all Americans, not just their fringe conservative base. In the first days of the newly minted 112th Congress, after the 2010 midterms gave Republicans control of the House of Representatives, the American people were clamoring for action on jobs and the economy. What did the new Republican House give them? One of the first laws introduced was the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. Whereas existing federal law already limited the use of government funds to pay for abortion, there were exceptions for incest and rape. The No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act attempted to narrow the definition of rape to only involving force. Republican House Speaker John Boehner called the legislation a top priority for his caucus. Maybe for conservative Republicans but certainly not for most Americans, especially when unemployment was 9% and the economy was still reeling from the Great Recession. Then, as now, Americans say the economy is the most important problem facing the country. Even all the fear and fear-mongering around ISIS and Ebola hasn't changed this. People are far more worried about the economy and the job market. Abortion barely registers as a concern in the polls. Meanwhile, Republicans have touted a list of ""more than 30 jobs bills"" they have passed in the House but have failed in the Democratic Senate. The party has even printed the list on handy flash cards so that the likes of Boehner can carry them in their pockets and wave around at political events. But those so-called ""jobs bills"" include repealing Obamacare, gutting clean air and water regulations, and weakening the National Labor Relations Board. In other words, they're not really jobs bills but simply fig leaves for conservatives' long-standing ideological agenda. Economists say the actual job growth impact of the GOP agenda is next to zero -- not to mention the harm it will do to working Americans who rely on wage standards and protections, or the 10 million-plus Americans who have gained health insurance through Obamacare. When Republicans controlled just one house of Congress, they perpetually and annoyingly passed symbolic pet legislation that stood no chance of becoming law. Now that Republicans control both houses, that behavior won't just be irritating but downright irresponsible. The American people have entrusted Republicans with control of Congress. They expect Congress to lead, not continue to throw partisan temper tantrums. Leading, in this context, means passing laws that solve real problems and are in forms that both parties agree on. No more Orwellian circus shows. For six years, Republicans have condemned President Barack Obama and the Democratic agenda. Regardless of how the midterm results panned out due to a handful of races in red and maroon-ish purple states, the fact remains that the Democratic agenda is broadly and strongly supported. Most Americans support extending unemployment benefits, passing paid sick leave, lowering student loan rates and raising the minimum wage, as was reflected in ballot measure results across the country Tuesday. It's why many of the Republicans who won their races actually ran as rhetorical liberals, trying to mask their unpopular stances on women's issues and more. Going into this election, while only 23% of Americans have a ""very positive"" view of Obama and just 12% view the Democratic Party very positively, the favorability percentage for the Republican Party is even lower -- just 7%, according to one survey. Not exactly time to spike the football. Of course, no party should govern based solely on popular referendum. That would be stupid. But governing without any concern for what the people want is insane. Seven in 10 Americans oppose limiting access to abortion, according to a recent poll. So why is it that in the past three years, state legislatures have passed more anti-abortion measures than in the entire previous decade? The new Republican leadership in Congress should focus on issues such as rebuilding our crumbling bridges and other public infrastructure, or passing bipartisan immigration reform to help level wages and working standards for everyone in America. Maybe there are even reasonable compromises to be found in reforming the tax code, making it simpler and more transparent while at the same time fairer. Either way, the GOP should stop shutting down the government and blocking the President's appointments. Sure, the American people blame both parties for gridlock. But when asked, they place more blame with Republicans. Now that they have full power in Congress either to compromise or not with the White House, Republicans have no more excuses. And if Republicans don't start learning how to lead in a responsible, bipartisan fashion, the American people will have no more patience. In 1975 when the O'Jays sang ""Give the People What They Want,"" they sang about the people wanting ""better education now"" and ""better food to eat"" and ""better homing"" (by which I assume they meant housing, not pigeons). The O'Jays were singing about the real world -- real people and problems that political leaders should be addressing. Republicans have to stop singing their tired tune of ""Criticize Everything President Obama Does"" and instead starting singing harmony with the Democrats to get things done in Washington and, yes, ""Give the People What They Want."" We have real problems in America that need real solutions and real leaders doing the hard work of governing together. Here's hoping Republicans are up to the task to which they've been elected.","Sally Kohn: Now that the GOP has control of Congress, it needs to do a better job .

"Washington (CNN) -- First-term Democratic incumbent North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan lost in a tight contest against GOP challenger Thom Tillis, according to a CNN projection. It was the most expensive Senate race this cycle: A great deal of the funding was provided by out-of-state organizations backing harsh television attack ads. The neck-and-neck race was key to Republicans' plans to win back the Senate from Democrats. With 99% of precincts reporting their vote totals, Tillis had 49 % to Hagan's 47%. Tillis is known for his conservative stances on issues like same-sex marriage and women's abortion rights. He worked to nationalize the race by tying Hagan to President Obama, who suffers from high disapproval ratings in the Tar Heel state even though he -- along with Hagan -- were victorious there in 2008. Tillis made national news in late October when he debated an empty chair on live television after his opponent refused to attend what was initially billed as a debate between the two candidates. Hagan launched aggressive attacks on Tillis' tenure in the state legislature, highlighting how his legislature cut unemployment benefits, slashed funding for education and prohibited the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. She also worked to bolster her own appeal with racial minorities by pointing out Tillis' enactment of a strict voter identification law. Neither candidate has enjoyed much popularity in the state according to an NBC News/Marist poll from last week showing Hagan's disapproval rating at 48 percent and Tillis' at 44 percent.","The North Carolina Senate race was the most expensive Senate race in history .

"(CNN) -- The Green Vault in Dresden Castle houses one of the largest collections of treasure in Europe, with its spectacular baroque chambers filled with jewels and objets d'art. Although these masterpieces are comparable with those of Florence or Venice, they have yet to achieve the renown of the Italian museums. But with restoration of the castle completed last year, the Green Vault stands out as the jewel-box of Europe for its exceptional art and architecture, and its representation of one of the world's great cultural cities. In the early 18th century, Augustus the Strong, ruler of Saxony, worked to establish Dresden as a major center for the arts, inviting talented sculptors, goldsmiths and painters to take up residence. He commissioned a series of magnificent rooms to showcase his valuables as a way of advertising the city's cultural prominence in addition to its wealth. The result was the Green Vault, the first public museum in Europe. It is an astounding collection of ornaments, ranging from shimmering bowls carved out of crystal and agate to jeweled gold figurines to the Dresden Green, the largest and finest green diamond in the world. During the Allied bombing of 1945, Dresden was decimated, and the vault was destroyed. Though the treasures had been relocated to a fortress, they were later confiscated by the Red Army and taken to Russia. In 1958, the jewels were returned to Dresden, but most of the pieces were not on public display until 2004, after a reconstruction project costing over 45 million euros. Striking photos reveal hidden history of black Britons in the Victorian era . Today, this splendid museum is divided into two parts. In the elegant New Green Vault, individual pieces are shown in modern minimalist cases, with lighting and technology designed precisely to enhance each object. Downstairs, the Historic Green Vault recreates the grand halls of Augustus, with rooms devoted to specific materials such as ivory and amber, and suites of gems classified by color. These rooms are baroque works of art in themselves, mirrored and painted malachite green with gold trimmings. The curiosities here include goblets fashioned from gilded ostrich eggs, ivory towers with impossibly tiny spirals and a radiant cabinet of carved amber. The New Green Vault is celebrating the 10th anniversary of its opening, and it contains over a thousand of Augustus' best pieces, which were intended to stun visitors and subjects with a show of extravagance and craftsmanship. Among the highlights are drinking vessels engraved with Chinese motifs and jewelry inspired by the royal court of Delhi. It is fascinating to see how often European ideals of luxury took the form of orientalist fantasies during this period. According to Dr. Larry Silver, professor of art history at the University of Pennsylvania, the Mughal empire had acquired a legendary reputation at this time, becoming a symbol of ""power and wealth [that] could only be imagined and envied by European rulers ... a fairytale image of magnificence to be admired and imitated."" How some whisky lovers are now making millions . Augustus' most valued possession was a miniature diorama depicting the unlimited riches of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Augustus' contemporary on the Indian subcontinent. Aurangzeb, who was referred to as the ""world-seizer,"" is seen at his 50th birthday celebrations during the height of the empire. From his throne, he receives rajahs and princes; dishes filled with gold coins and elephants draped in gems are presented as gifts. In an unusual twist, the walls of the court are decorated with Chinese dragons, so that a dream of orientalism becomes even more fantastic. This diorama was created over seven years by the great goldsmith and royal jeweler, Johann Melchior Dinglinger, and features rubies, emeralds, pearls, over 4000 diamonds and a single sapphire. Only 58 centimeters tall, it cost Augustus more than the construction of the opulent Moritzburg Castle. Dinglinger is responsible for several of the masterworks in the collection, including the Jewel of the Order of the Golden Fleece, a prestigious insignia with three flaming rubies used to signify the values of knighthood. His most iconic piece may be the so-called Moor with Emerald Cluster, a statue of a dark-skinned young prince (whose tattoos are actually native American) bearing a tortoiseshell platter of Colombian emeralds. The memorabilia honoring Soviet space dogs . Like the city of Dresden, the Green Vault has been strategically rebuilt, in a style which combines modern and baroque elements. For Hartwig Fischer, director of the Dresden State Art Collections, the construction of the vault has caused people in Saxony to ""fundamentally rethink our architectural heritage,"" more than any building of the last century. The New Green Vault is a triumph of sleek lines and cutting-edge presentation; for its 10th anniversary, a new lighting scheme has been introduced to focus the gaze on individual works. On the other hand, the restored Historic section embodies the total fusion of art and architecture envisioned by Augustus. As such, the vault reflects Dresden's two sides: its past as the ""Florence of the Elbe"" and its current status as a hub for contemporary design. The 10 greatest book covers of all time .

"(CNN) -- After months of psychological torment by guards loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, when a commotion arose outside the door of his solitary confinement cell in Tripoli's most notorious prison, Matthew VanDyke was sure he was going to be executed. But what happened next is sure to be the Baltimore-based adventure writer's wildest chapter yet. Reached by phone in a safe house in Tripoli, VanDyke, 32, described a harrowing 30 hours that took him from Abu Salim prison to the safe house under the protection of anti-Gadhafi rebels. The freelance journalist and aspiring travel writer had not been heard from since mid-March, shortly before he was arrested in the city of Brega by forces loyal to Gadhafi. He had been without contact with any family member, government official or aid organization since March 12, when he last spoke to his mother. Early Wednesday in Tripoli, he said, he heard prisoners yelling and shouting and banging, not unlike the sounds he had heard as guards rousted out other prisoners during his six months of solitary confinement. As he stared at the white walls where he had ticked off the days until he lost track, he thought, ""This is it, they've come to lynch me."" A hand opened the small slit in the door where his food was passed through. He heard someone angrily shouting and pointing at verses in an open Quran pushed through the door. Not long after, someone hammered off the lock on the door. At first he thought it was a trap, he told his mother by phone, maybe a ruse to get him in greater danger. But then the realization dawned: He had a chance to escape. ""I saw some other prisoners and they were cheering and pointing down the hall,"" said an exhausted VanDyke. ""I knew I was free, but didn't know what to do or what was going on."" VanDyke had no possessions to gather up, only a wet and ragged prison uniform. He found a pair of sandals left behind by another fleeing prisoner and then escaped the prison along with hundreds of other inmates. Many of those held in the facility were political prisoners, or had been caught up in crackdowns on rebel sympathizers or on the many battlefields edging closer to the capital. VanDyke joined up with one small group walking through the Abu Salim neighborhood of Tripoli, not knowing that they were in one of the last areas still controlled by Gadhafi loyalists. They could hear explosions and gunfire, but also got news that rebels were taking control of the city. The group made their way to a mosque. There, the imam and other neighborhood leaders were handing out cash, trying to help people desperately short of supplies amid the chaos and electrical blackout in the area. VanDyke said he moved on, to a makeshift hospital where he got some help and directions to a local wealthy person who had access to a working phone. It was there he was able to make his first phone call back to his worried girlfriend, Lauren Fischer, and mother, Sharon VanDyke, back in Baltimore. ""I've always known he was OK,"" Sharon VanDyke told CNN late Wednesday. The retired schoolteacher described the relief and surprise she felt after watching CNN endlessly for days, hoping for news and praying for her son's safety. Now she and Fischer are focused on getting him out of Libya. VanDyke said he was eventually able to hook up with another escaped inmate who had ties to rebel forces and could speak English. The man gained access to a car and two guards armed with AK-47 assault rifles, and they sped through the night past rebel checkpoints. Eventually he arrived at a house once occupied by an American expatriate couple who had hastily fled in the earliest days of the conflict. VanDyke said the home still had food on the counters, remnants from the last-second escape of the last people there, a welcome windfall for him after months of rancid prison food. And the working phone there was a lifeline to the outside, he added. The writer is one of at least four American civilians who have been freed from Libyan prisons, the U.S. government said Wednesday. ""We can confirm that all U.S. citizens who were known to be detained in Libya have been released,"" U.S. State . Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said in a prepared statement: . ""The families of those detained individuals have been notified of their freedom and welfare. We remain concerned about the welfare and safety of those U.S. citizens who remain in Tripoli. For safety and privacy reasons we are unable to provide additional details."" VanDyke was surprised to hear that other Americans had been held in the prison and was unaware of their escape or current situations. Having traveled to nearly a dozen Middle Eastern and African countries since 2007, VanDyke left for Benghazi in late February. Friends there had told him what was happening in Libya during the early stages of the revolution. ""He had a great respect for the people and the country, not the politics,"" his mother said. VanDyke's loved ones aren't certain why he was arrested, although he had a U.S. passport and press credentials when he was seized on a day trip to Brega. By phone, the exhausted writer said he would have a fuller account to tell of his capture after he was able to sleep and recuperate, but he said his arrest had been a surprise and he did not know the reason for it. VanDyke had been confined in two prisons, including Abu Salim, from which he and the hundreds of others escaped Wednesday, one day after rebels seized Gadhafi's compound in the city. Libyan officials had recently acknowledged VanDyke was in custody. His mother traveled to Turkey in May to seek assistance in his release, but the country had just closed its embassy in Tripoli. His family, which has been assisted by the State Department and U.S. Rep. C.A. ""Dutch"" Ruppersberger of Maryland, hopes to see VanDyke in several days. ""He said he was in good physical health,"" said his mother. ""He was sorry we did not know for sure he was OK."" Sharon VanDyke said her son was unaware that al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had been killed by U.S. commandos in May. She and Fischer, 28, expect VanDyke, who first went to Libya in 2008, to complete a book about the people he has met and places he has seen in Mauritania, Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan, Egypt and other countries. He toured several of those nations by motorcycle. ""Despite everything, I have no problems with Libyans,"" VanDyke said, describing his safety and plans in Tripoli. ""But I'll be determined to stay here to see the end of Gadhafi.""","Matthew VanDyke had been in solitary confinement since March .

"(CNN) -- Marion Stokes, a child of the Great Depression, spent her life saving everything -- literally. The Philadelphia resident kept everything from newspapers and electronics to empty cigarette packets and sticky-notes. Among the cardboard boxes and magazine stacks in her home were 140,000 cassette tapes containing recordings of all local and national TV news programs from every channel. Stokes spent 35 years recording the news 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. That amounts to 840,000 hours of videotaped news. With help from her family and a personal assistant, Stokes systematically recorded the news at her home until her death at age 83 in December 2012. She left her collection of tapes— her ""life's work""— to her only son, Michael Metelits. She gave him no specific instruction but told him that he could donate them to a charity of his choice. On Tuesday, Stokes' cassette tapes will arrive at the Internet Archive, a nonprofit organization in California, after a cross-country journey in four large shipping containers. The organization will digitize all 140,000 tapes into a public, searchable online archive. The $2 million project will take about 20 digitizing machines, volunteers working around the clock, funding and several years to complete, Metelits said. Metelits said he always knew what his mother wanted to do with the tapes. He called his mother a private yet persistent woman who believed that if the public had access to good information, they would make good decisions. Stokes, a TV producer, librarian and political activist, took it upon herself to preserve hundreds of thousands of hours of televised news in hopes of one day making these tapes a repository of knowledge available to the public. Now, nearly one year after her death, Metelits is finishing what his mother started in 1977 when she bought her first videotape recorder. ""I feel confident that maintaining a family connection and supporting the archive to whatever degree we can and working with them, we're helping preserve my mother's legacy,"" said Metelits, who temporarily moved back to Philadelphia from London before Stokes died. It took some time to decide on a home for his mother's tapes, and Metelits worried the entire collection would be too big of a project for one organization. He was overjoyed when the Internet Archive's director, Roger Macdonald, said the group would take them all. ""I almost teared up at how grateful I was. It's just amazing that someone can use everything that my mother did,"" Metelits said. For several years, Stokes and her husband traveled back and forth between houses in Philadelphia and Boston, until finally settling permanently in Philadelphia in the late 1980s. But this didn't prevent Stokes from recording the news; in fact, it allowed her to document historical events like the Boston busing crisis. It's this unique collection of local and national news that makes Stokes' tapes so ""remarkable,"" wrote Macdonald in a blog post for the Internet Archive. ""Her dream of using this collection for the public good can now be fulfilled,"" Macdonald wrote. Macdonald could not be reached for additional comment.","Philadelphia woman started recording TV news onto cassette tapes in 1977 .

"(CNN) -- We hate to break it to you, but if you are planning on seeing ""50 Shades of Grey"" so you can see a lot more of star Jamie Dornan, don't hold your breath.

The pair explore bondage/discipline, dominance/submission and sadism/masochism. Dornan described himself as a feminist to the publication and said he's not worried about backlash over those who may say the film glorifies violence against women.

"(CNN) -- Glynis Freeman stands on a tower balcony in nighttime London, peering down at the dizzying lights hundreds of feet below. The distant rumble of city traffic rises up from the streets. A gust of wind brushes her hair. Freeman smiles while swiveling her head in all directions to take in the view. ""That was cool,"" she said a few minutes later. ""I want to go back to London."" That's because Freeman was never physically in London. The Marietta, Georgia, woman was 4,000 miles away in an Atlanta hotel lobby, wearing a headset and trying out a demonstration of new technology that can place people in exotic virtual settings almost anywhere on the planet. It's all part of a new experiment by Marriott, the global hotel chain, to let guests sample virtual destinations with the Oculus Rift, a headset whose high-definition, 3-D display immerses wearers in a lifelike interactive world. ""We really want to appeal to the next generation of travelers,"" said Karen Olivares, director of global brand marketing for Marriott. Virtual travel is in its infancy and a long way from being mainstream. But the travel industry is intrigued by its potential, which goes far beyond Google Street View or online ""virtual tours"" of hotels and resorts. The idea is not that virtual travel will replace real-world travel, because nobody in the industry would go for that. Instead, the travel industry hopes that people who sample virtual snippets of alluring vacations -- say, rafting the Grand Canyon or hiking the Great Wall of China -- will be persuaded to splurge on the real thing. Behind the Oculus Rift . Driving this trend are next-generation systems such as the Oculus Rift and Sony's Project Morpheus, which promise a leap forward in virtual-reality technology. The much-hyped Oculus Rift headset looks like something a skier or scuba diver might wear and fits snugly over the wearer's face, paired with headphones. Its crisp 3D display immerses you in an interactive world -- a medieval village or a tropical jungle -- which you sometimes can navigate with the help of a game controller. The goggles come packed with a 100-degree field of view, extending beyond viewers' peripheral vision. They have an accelerometer, gyroscope and compass to track the position of your head and sync the visuals to the direction where you are looking -- allowing Oculus to improve on the sometimes jerky visuals of other virtual-reality systems. The Oculus Rift was designed to enhance video gaming. But Facebook paid $2 billion for its maker, Oculus VR, in March, seeing the device as a potential future communication platform. One developer for the Oculus Rift is excited about the technology's long-term potential to tranform travel. ""I could go for a run in the morning in some exotic beach and in the evening stroll the streets of some city ... I could be a virtual storm chaser close to a tornado and even travel deep in the ocean,"" the developer wrote in an online forum. ""In fact these experiences will be so real, without risk, and of course cheap that I might actually have second thoughts about traveling ... Antarctica without the cold ... Jungles without the heat and bugs ... And people who will provide (this) content will make millions."" Virtual journeying . Consumer versions of the Oculus Rift and Project Morpheus -- which works in much the same way -- aren't expected on the market until 2015 at the earliest. But that hasn't stopped the travel industry from tinkering with prototypes. Thomas Cook, the international travel agency, announced a trial program in August that will allow customers at one of its stores in England to don Oculus Rifts and experience a flight on one of its airplanes or tour a Sentido resort. And Marriott has been touring U.S. cities this fall with its ""Teleporter,"" a booth that invites visitors to climb inside, strap on an Oculus Rift and take a virtual tour of Wai'anapanapa Black Sand Beach in Maui and Tower 42 in London. Viewers watch a 90-second video produced by Framestore, the British creative studio that has done visual effects for ""Gravity"" and other movies.

"New York (CNN) -- It cost Alex Rodriguez nearly $1 million to buy his cousin's silence on ""very sensitive"" matters, according to court documents. The Yankees star paid his cousin and former personal assistant Yuri Sucart $900,000 in 2013 and gave him and his family medical insurance, a 2009 Chevrolet Suburban and a 5-bedroom house, in return for Sucart keeping quiet on confidential matters, said documents filed in federal court in Miami. The alleged hush money came in response to a December 2012 letter from Sucart's attorney, Jeffrey Sonn, threatening a lawsuit and demanding $5 million and a ""life estate"" for his client. ""Unfortunately for you,"" the letter said, ""litigation with you over [Sucart's] employment agreement will reveal all of his duties you instructed Yuri to perform."" According to court documents, Sucart introduced and personally arranged meetings between Rodriguez and Tony Bosch, the founder of the Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in Miami that is alleged to be at the center of Major League Baseball's largest doping scandal. Fourteen players were suspended for using performance-enhancing drugs from the now closed clinic, including Rodriguez, who received a 162-game suspension -- the most severe doping penalty in MLB history. Sucart was arrested in August and charged with conspiracy and distribution of illegal steroids in connection with the scandal. In court documents, federal prosecutors said the letter from Sucart's lawyer suggested ""the defendant would maintain his silence"" in exchange for money. Sonn told CNN Tuesday: ""This was not a threat. This was about his (Alex Rodriguez's) promise to employ Yuri Sucart for life and his breach of that agreement. These guys were like brothers."" Rodriguez's lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, could not be reached for comment. The payments were first reported by the New York Daily News, citing court documents filed last week in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The letter and subsequent agreement between Rodriguez and Sucart were presented as evidence to support the prosecution's argument that Sucart had lied on a financial document about his ability to pay for a court-appointed attorney. During his employment, Sucart acted as a ""servant"" to Rodriguez and ""handled matters that were of a very sensitive and confidential nature,"" according to the 2012 letter from Sucart's attorney. In 2009, Rodriguez admitted at a news conference that his cousin transported and administered to him a performance enhancing drug from the Dominican Republic. ""He basically took an instruction from me and felt he was doing something that was going to be helpful, not hurtful,"" Rodriguez said. From 2003 to 2012, Rodriguez paid Sucart an annual salary ranging from $50,000 to over $110,000 for his services, according to court documents. Rodriguez employed Sucart beginning in 1996 and paid him through the third quarter of 2013, according to court documents. According to Sonn, Rodriguez's payments stopped unexpectedly in November 2012, leaving Sucart, his wife and two children in dire straits. ""You ceased providing Yuri and his family, indeed your own family, any support, and he has suffered greatly, financially and emotionally due to your actions,"" the letter said. ""Given the sudden breach of your longstanding agreement with Yuri,"" the letter continues, ""he wishes to propose that you provide to him payment for his past services rendered, and for the loyalty he has shown to you."" Half a year later, Rodriguez and his cousin reached a settlement under silence and secrecy, according to the documents. The June 2013 Confidential Settlement Agreement included in the prosecution's evidence details the terms of the deal. The prosecution also included copies of four receipts for wire transfers totaling $900,000 from Rodriguez to a firm connected to Sucart. Rodriguez's doping suspension by MLB officially ended last week with the close of the 2014 baseball season. He is eligible to return to the field with the Yankees in 2015. Sucart faces up to ten years in prison if convicted.","Alex Rodriguez paid his cousin $900,000 in return for his silence, prosecutors say .

"RECIFE, Brazil (CNN)  -- Seventeen bodies have been recovered from last week's crash of an Air France jetliner off the South American coast, Brazil's military said Sunday. A boat from the Brazilian navy picks up debris in the Atlantic on Sunday. The Brazilian navy and air force said they found nine bodies in the Atlantic Ocean, where the Airbus A330-200 went down. The crew of a French vessel taking part in the search has found eight, military officials told reporters Sunday evening. Air France 447 disappeared over the Atlantic early Monday. The jet was en route to Paris, France, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with 228 passengers and crew aboard. The bodies were found floating about 700 miles  (1,100 kilometers) from the Brazilian coast. Items found in the same area Saturday were confirmed to have come from the jet, including pieces of the aircraft's wing section, luggage and a leather briefcase containing an airplane ticket with a reservation code for the doomed flight, Brazilian air force spokesman Jorge Amaral told CNN. The exact location of the crash has not been determined, since ocean currents likely caused the bodies and debris to drift in the six days since the crash. And two key pieces of evidence -- the flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- remain missing, and could lay on the ocean floor.  Map of Flight 447's flight path » . The part of the ocean where the debris and bodies have been found ranges between 19,685 and 26,247 feet (6,000 and 8,000 meters) deep. The search area covers 77,220 square miles (200,000 square km), an area nearly as big as the country of Romania.  CNN's Carl Penhaul reports on more bodies found » . Fourteen aircraft -- 12 Brazilian and two French -- were participating in the recovery efforts, along with five Brazilian ships and one French frigate. In Washington, a U.S. defense official told CNN the U.S. Navy will contribute two high-tech acoustic devices to listen for emergency beacons still operating in deep water. The ""towed pinger locators"" help search for emergency beacons on downed aircraft to a maximum depth of 20,000 feet, and will be placed aboard two French tugs that are part of the search efforts, the official said. Recovery of bodies and debris is significant not only for families, but for crash investigators, said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. ""Even if they don't find anything else they can get some very important clues from the pieces that they do find and from the human remains,"" Schiavo told CNN Saturday. She said investigators would be able to discern if there was an explosion from possible residue on the bodies or other items. Or, if water is found in the lungs of victims, investigators would know the plane went down intact, she said. Investigators in Paris said Saturday that the Air France flight sent out 24 automated error messages lasting about four minutes before it crashed. The error messages suggest the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through severe thunderstorms it encountered before the crash, officials said. Schiavo said the four minutes of automated signals sent from the plane ""was a very long time."" Investigators also reported the airline failed to replace a part on the aircraft, as recommended by the manufacturer, Airbus. Airbus had advised airlines to update equipment that monitors speed, known as Pitot tubes. The recommendation was a result of technological developments and improvements, an Airbus spokesman told CNN. The change was not mandatory, and the spokesman would not comment on Air France's failure to follow the advice. CNN's Karl Penhaul, Richard Quest and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Brazilian military finds nine bodies; crew of French vessel finds eight .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Who would've thought? Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg speaks Mandarin. When I first read a banner headline saying that the 20-something billionaire spoke fluently in Chinese, I was skeptical. Yes, I know he's young and smart. Yes, he's married to Priscilla Chan, a publicity-shy medical doctor of Chinese parentage. But she's also American-born Chinese and, like many of them, does not necessarily speak Chinese like a native. Besides, one does not learn a foreign language simply by marrying a Chinese speaker. But the Facebook CEO impressed his star-struck Chinese audience when he spoke in Chinese during a 30-minute Q&A recently at Beijing's Tsinghua University. ""He showed respect for China by taking the trouble to learn the language and I think the audience appreciated it,"" said John C. Thomson, one of the pioneers of teaching Chinese as a foreign language and a former Chinese translator for Ronald Reagan. Zuckerberg spoke entirely in Mandarin, albeit with a heavy accent and the occasional error. Yet some Chinese-speaking expatriates disparaged his Chinese proficiency -- deeming it ""poor"" and ""mediocre,"" while others dismissed the session at Tsinghua as a PR stunt, perhaps to curry favor in China where Facebook has remained blocked since 2009. Learning for 42 years . But I was impressed. His tones might have been off most of the time but then so were mine when I was just beginning to get a ""feel"" for the language. As a famous billionaire he could have said no to the idea, instead of risking looking like a fool in public. ""He deserves credit for undertaking sustained study of Chinese while growing a major Internet company,"" agreed Thomson. ""He and his firm do not need more PR, but full access for Facebook in China would be great."" I'm impressed not because I'm star-struck but because I know how hard a language Chinese is. Two months into my first Chinese course some 42 years ago, I was ready to give up, totally intimidated and overwhelmed by its grammar rules (or lack of them), five tones and pictographs. Fortunately, I persisted. After several months of drills and practice, I got into the Chinese language ""zone"" and started to enjoy it. Still, I do not think I could have learned it well if I had only attended courses overseas -- without the immersion that I got by living and studying in China. I acquired it because I was surrounded by Mandarin and because I had to. David Moser, a veteran sinologist and a long-time Beijing resident, explained why Chinese is so daunting. ""Those who undertake to study the language for any other reason than the sheer joy of it will always be frustrated by the abysmal ratio of effort to effect, he wrote in a paper when he was at the University of Michigan Center for Chinese Studies. ""Those who are attracted to the language precisely because of its daunting complexity and difficulty will never be disappointed."" Moser ticked off several reasons why Chinese is so damn hard: . -- Because the writing system is ridiculous. -- Because the language doesn't have the common sense to use an alphabet. -- Because the writing system just ain't very phonetic. -- Because tonal languages are weird; . -- Because East is East and West is West, and the twain have only recently met. Cultural shift . Remarkably, Chinese is now enjoying a new found popularity. Just as English became the popular choice as a second language because of the influence of the British Empire before the World War I and the U.S. after World War II, we're now witnessing ""a major shift in economic and cultural influence, from the U.S. to China,"" said Thomson, who spent 30 years in China, most recently as director of the Inter-University Program for Chinese Language Study at Tsinghua University. He cites China's major push to promote Chinese language overseas, combined with a growing recognition that Chinese language ability will give people a huge advantage in dealing with China and its people. ""Compared with the several American students studying Chinese in Taiwan in 1966-68 when I was there as a student, there are now about 25,000 American students in China each year, most of them studying Chinese language, and a large and a growing number of Americans are studying Chinese as part of their K-12 education in the U.S."" His tip to Chinese language students? ""First get a good foundation overseas for grammar and pronunciation, followed by an extended stay in China for study or work where most or all people speak Chinese all day."" You have to use it, lest you lose it. ""China is a great country,"" Zuckerberg told his Chinese audience on why learn Chinese."" I think learning the language can help me know the country's culture... And I love a challenge."" Learning Mandarin, some say, is for those who don't mind making fools of themselves. Just like the Facebook billionaire.","Mark Zuckerberg deserves credit for learning Mandarin, says Jaime FlorCruz .
Mastering Chinese is a lifelong process and its grammar, five tones, and pictographs can be overwhelming .

"(CNN) -- Controversial Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders appeared in court Wednesday on charges of inciting discrimination and hatred that relate in part to his much-criticized film about Islam. Wednesday's session at the Court of Amsterdam was a pre-trial hearing and a full trial was due to begin later this year. A court spokesman said the hearing was expected to last one day but could stretch into Thursday. Wilders, who heads the Dutch Party for Freedom, said he has done nothing wrong. ""I will fight,"" he promised in a statement Tuesday on the party's Web site. Prosecutors initially decided not to pursue the case, saying in June 2008 that Wilders' statements were not liable to punishment, the Public Prosecutions Service said. They said that even though Wilders' comments were ""defamatory and hurtful to a great number of Muslims,"" they fell within the limits of free speech. The Court of Appeals disagreed with that decision and ordered that Wilders be prosecuted. In addition to inciting discrimination and hatred, Wilders is also charged with offending a group of people, which relates to his comparison of Islam to Nazism. ""According to Wilders, the truth about Islam must be made known, even if it is painful and unpleasant for certain people,"" his statement on his party's site said. The charges relate to comments Wilders made in a variety of media between 2006 and 2008. They include an October 2006 interview with the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant in which he said he wanted to stop the ""tsunami of Islamisation,"" and another in September 2007 with Radio Netherlands in which he said the Quran should be banned. Wilders' film ""Fitna,"" which he released online in March 2008 to international outcry, is also part of the charges against him. The film features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran in order to paint Islam as a threat to Western society. After its release, the movie drew complaints from the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, as well as concern from the United States. Wilders was denied entry into Britain in February 2009 when he flew there to screen the film. Wednesday's pre-trial review does not cover the merits of the case, but will allow both sides to prepare for a hearing later in the year which will deal with the merits, the Public Prosecutions Service said. If found guilty, Wilders faces up to two years in prison and a fine of up to €19,000 ($26,900) for each charge.","Wilders' full trial expected to begin later this year .

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- Warring parties in South Sudan have agreed to peace talks where a cessation of hostilities between President Salva Kiir's forces and supporters of former Vice President Riek Machar will top the agenda, the United Nations special representative to South Sudan told CNN on Tuesday. The two sides have agreed to nominate delegations to be sent to Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, home of the African Union, for the talks that are likely to begin Thursday, Hilde Johnson, the special representative, said. The announcement by Johnson contradicted earlier reports in the day that a cease-fire had been reached. The Intergovernmental Authority on Development, along with the African Union and other countries, has been mediating between the battling parties following an outbreak of deadly violence in South Sudan. Despite word of the pending peace talks, fighting continued Tuesday in the towns of Bor, capital of oil-rich Jonglei state, and Bentiu, in Unity state, with no sign of a cease-fire in sight. East African leaders on Friday gave the warring factions four days to lay down their arms, in a bid to bring more than two weeks of violence to an end. The fighting began after Kiir, from South Sudan's Dinka ethnic group, accused troops loyal to Machar, from the Nuer community, of trying to launch a coup. The two men have long been political rivals, and Kiir dismissed Machar, along with the Cabinet, in July. Negotiating peace . A source close to Machar told CNN on Tuesday that the rebel leader has sent a delegation to Addis Ababa for talks with the South Sudanese government. Dina Mufti, a spokesman for Ethiopia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Kiir and Machar would meet in the city. But the source close to Machar, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told CNN he was not going himself but was sending a team that includes Rebecca Garang, the widow of former leader John Garang, and the acting governor of Jonglei state. Mufti said the discussions would have an ""unstructured agenda,"" with the talking points to be decided in the course of the meeting. The talks will be chaired by Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, who's the current chairman of the African Union and Intergovernmental Authority on Development. Other parties will also mediate in the talks, Mufti said. CNN has been unable to reach anyone from the South Sudanese government for comment on the talks. Kiir told CNN on Monday that African nations should have acted quickly to help quell the rebel forces. As soon as an attempted coup took place and violence broke out, ""the original leaders and all African leaders should have come in with military support,"" so that the rebels would have been ""crushed once and for all,"" he said. If the other side, led by Machar, does not agree to talk, then ""we will fight,"" Kiir vowed. ""In both cases,"" he said, peace ""will be restored."" Sanctions threat . The leaders of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development warned Friday that they would ""take action"" to stop the conflict that the United Nations says has killed more than 1,000 people and forced about 122,000 from their homes. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, at a news conference, said that if Machar did not agree to talks, the other countries would ""go for him."" Asked what that means, he said, ""defeat him."" The Peace and Security Council of the African Union, which met Monday in Gambia, called on all sides to ""immediately and unconditionally cease hostilities"" and engage in dialogue. It also warned it would take measures including ""targeted sanctions"" against those who incite violence and ethnic strife, hinder humanitarian efforts or harm civilians. White Army . Bor, a strategically important town in the center of the country, has been a flashpoint for violence. It was recaptured by the army last week in a bloody battle. But the latest clashes suggest that rebels loyal to Machar are unwilling to let go easily. Sudan People's Liberation Army spokesman Col. Phillip Aguer warned over the weekend that about 20,000 ethnic Nuer from the so-called White Army, an ethnic militia loyal to Machar, were headed to Bor. South Sudanese Deputy Information Minister Rachel Nyedak Paul told CNN on Monday that government officials had persuaded the White Army to retreat from the town. But members of the militia were involved in Tuesday's clashes, according to Paul -- suggesting that the agreement had broken down. The youths are known as the White Army for the white powder they use to cover their skin as an insect repellent. Fighting first broke out on December 15 in the capital city of Juba. It then quickly spread across the country, with reports of mass killings that were lent credence by mass graves. 'No clean water, no food' The violence has sparked a growing humanitarian crisis. Of at least 122,000 people displaced since the fighting began, about 63,000 have taken refuge in U.N. bases in the country, according to the United Nations. The nongovernmental organization Doctors Without Borders said Monday that aid is urgently needed for 70,000 people who have fled the fighting in Bor. They have sought shelter in the town of Awerial, in neighboring Lakes state, but the town is ill-equipped to cope with the influx, it said. ""Living conditions are verging on the catastrophic,"" the group said in a prepared statement. Aurelie Dupont, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Awerial, said the situation for women and children who've fled their homes with few belongings was alarming. ""There is no clean water, no food, and no place to shelter or sleep,"" she said. ""They are relying solely on the help of the local population."" A report submitted to the African Union council meeting said the situation on the ground remains ""very volatile,"" amid worsening ethnic tensions. ""There are reliable reports that a large number of civilians died in a series of selective killings in Bor town, in Jonglei State, and Bentiu town, in Unity State, that looks very much like an ethnic pogrom,"" it said. South Sudan formally split from Sudan in 2011 after a referendum, following decades of conflict. Numerous armed groups remain active in the oil-rich country. CNN's Arwa Damon and Antonia Mortensen reported from Juba and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Lillian Leposo and Nana Karikari-apau, and journalist Michael Atsbeha contributed to this report.","NEW: Warring sides in South Sudan agree to peace talks, a U.N. representative says .

"(CNN) -- It's a famous photograph: Sophia Loren, seated at a table, looking with side-eyed concern at Jayne Mansfield's breasts, which threaten to spill out of her low-cut dress. The 1957 photo, which was taken when the Italian film star was new to Hollywood, shows Loren as shocked and frightened -- and she absolutely was, she tells Entertainment Weekly. ""Listen. Look at the picture. Where are my eyes? I'm staring at her nipples because I am afraid they are about to come onto my plate,"" she told the magazine. ""In my face you can see the fear. I'm so frightened that everything in her dress is going to blow -- BOOM! -- and spill all over the table."" Loren, now 80, was 23 at the time, a beauty who'd dazzled at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival. Mansfield, perhaps known today as the mother of ""Law & Order: SVU's"" Mariska Hargitay, was making her name as the blonde bombshell star of ""The Girl Can't Help It"" and ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"" She knew how to make an entrance, recalled Loren. ""Paramount had organized a party for me. All of cinema was there; it was incredible,"" she said. ""And then comes in Jayne Mansfield, the last one to come. ... She came right for my table. She knew everyone was watching."" Indeed, there are a number of other photographs of Mansfield's arrival, many showing Loren smiling. But Loren says that the only one accurately showing her mood is the side-eye. She won't even sign it -- partly out of respect for Mansfield, who died in a car crash in 1967, and partly because it frankly makes her uncomfortable. ""Many, many times I am given this photo to autograph it. And I never do,"" she said. ""I don't want to have anything to do with that."" Loren's memoir, ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow: My Life,"" was released Tuesday.","Sophia Loren: Side-eye in photo showed shock, fear .

"(CNN) -- By Friday, more than 70 million people had viewed ""KONY 2012"" or clips of it. Uganda was trending on Twitter and the blogosphere teemed with attacks and defenses of Invisible Children, the San Diego-based nonprofit group that produced the half-hour documentary about the notorious Ugandan warlord. Invisible Children aimed to make Joseph Kony a household name and drum up global support to end the murders, rapes, abuses and abductions committed by the Lord's Resistance Army. But with the popularity of the video and kudos to the filmmakers for raising awareness of an African tragedy came a flurry of questions about Invisible Children's intentions, its transparency and whether the social media frenzy was too little, too late. ""It is the right message but it's 15 years too late, "" said Col. Felix Kulayige, a Ugandan military spokesman. ""If people cared 15 years ago, then thousands of lives would have been saved and thousands of children would have stayed at home and not been kidnapped."" Evelyn Apoko, who was abducted by the LRA in 2001 and spent three harrowing years in captivity, said Kony needs to face justice and she hoped the documentary would help make that happen. But she worried that a military campaign against Kony might bring more injury to children who have suffered enough and that government forces need to adopt strict policies to ensure the safety of the abducted children. Apoko was severely disfigured in a military bombing targeting the LRA. ""It hurts a lot of young innocent kids,"" she said. ""They don't know how to protect themselves."" Now a fellow for Strongheart, an international organization that provides opportunities for young people who have survived conflict, Apoko said the crisis goes beyond Kony. ""They should open their eyes more on the people affected by the war,"" she said. ""And the children -- they need to find a way to protect them. They have no hope, no way to escape."" Kony has unleashed his fury in eastern Africa for two decades and is wanted for crimes against humanity by the International criminal Court. Last October, the United States sent 100 combat-equipped troops on a mission to kill or capture Kony. Invisible Children says it wants Kony's name to become so familiar that it will pressure the United States and other governments to stay on the chase. On April 20, the group plans to paper cities with Kony posters. But the media attention on Kony may actually hamper efforts to catch Kony, said Peter Pham of the Atlantic Council. ""All I can say is, it couldn't have happened at a more unhelpful moment when you look at it strategically and operationally,"" said Pham, a civilian adviser to the military command that sent the U.S. troops. The film comes after a regional -- and covert -- military operation has been under way for several months. The attention could prompt Kony to go on the move again and seriously set back African and U.S. efforts to catch Kony once and for all. The LRA terrorized Uganda for years in a failed attempt to overthrow the government. But since 2006, when it was pushed out of northern Uganda, it has largely operated the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic. The United Nations refugee agency said this week that 3,000 people were recently displaced after fresh LRA attacks in Congo's Orientale province. The agency reported 20 new attacks since the start of the year, with one person killed and 17 abducted. The cultish rebel group stands accused of using vicious tactics to recruit and force thousands of children into taking up arms. There are reports of child soldiers brainwashed into killing their own parents. The film follows an alleged former Ugandan child soldier and calls for action against Kony. But several observers are urging caution, saying that Invisible Children has manipulated facts in the past and advised viewers to watch the documentary with that in mind. Others warned that calling for military campaigns against Kony would only bring more harm to the LRA's victims. A student blog called ""Visible Children"" linked to a photograph of Invisible Children's founders -- Bobby Bailey, Laren Poole, and Jason Russell -- posing with hardcore weaponry with members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, who have battled the LRA. ""The group is in favor of direct military intervention, and their money supports the Ugandan government's army and various other military forces,"" the Visible Children blog post said. ""Both the Ugandan army and Sudan People's Liberation Army are riddled with accusations of rape and looting, but Invisible Children defends them."" Bloggers debated the merit of arming one group to fight another and questioned why only about 30% of Invisible Children's budget was used to help children in Uganda. ""We're an unorthodox organization,"" Russell told CNN. ""We work outside of the traditional box of what you think about charity and nonprofit."" He said a third of fund-raising dollars were spent on the film, another third on film-related advocacy and the rest on a mission to end the war and rehabilitate war-affected children. ""So that's our model,"" he said. ""That's who we are. We're not World Vision. We are not these other organizations that do amazing work on the ground. If you want to fund a cow or you want to help someone in a village in that component, you can do that. That's a third of what we do."" On its website, Invisible Children said it spent 80.46% on programs in 2011; 16.24% on administration and management costs; and 3.22% on direct fundraising. Invisible Children spokeswoman Noelle Jouglet said any money generated from the film will go to Invisible Children, which builds schools in Uganda. Money will also go to support a high-frequency radio station that Invisible Children operates, which broadcasts anti-LRA messages to fighters urging them to defect. CNN is unable to immediately verify this information or any of Invisible Children's activities in African nations. Actress Mia Farrow, a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF who has visited LRA-attacked areas, commended Invisible Children for bringing ""unprecedented focus"" to a horrific situation but urged people to donate money to agencies like the Red Cross and UNICEF that work to help LRA victims. Ugandan government spokesman Fred Opolot said Invisible Children's campaign reflected Africa as a dark continent of incessant trouble. ""Invisible Children, if it is using such images to dupe the international community into, into ensuring that they contribute financially into its works, I'm afraid to say it is a wrong approach,"" he said, ""and indeed its activities in northern Uganda will be further questioned, in as far as the amount of money they receive vis-a-vis the actual interventions that they make in northern Uganda where he thinks he is concerned about."" ""KONY 2012"" skyrocketed to popularity on YouTube propelled by thousands of posts on Twitter and Facebook, especially by celebrities. Invisible Children sent Twitter messages about the documentary to 20 celebrities, including Bono, Angelina Jolie, Jay Z, Ryan Seacrest and Rihanna. Many of the tweets about the film appear to be from fans who follow those celebrities. ""The celebrity strategy is simply, you have a voice,"" Russell said. ""Some people have a larger voice than others. We're not obsessed with celebrities. We're not celebrities ourselves. We're human beings. That is what this is about."" Over the past decade, Invisible Children has been one of the most influential advocacy groups, putting pressure on the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, imploring the U.S. government to take a side in the fight between the LRA and the Ugandan government, according to a November 11 article in Foreign Affairs, a publication by the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations. It said Invisible Children and other advocacy groups ""have manipulated facts for strategic purposes, exaggerating the scale of LRA abductions and murders and emphasizing the LRA's use of innocent children as soldiers."" ""They rarely refer to the Ugandan atrocities or those of Sudan's People's Liberation Army, such as attacks against civilians or looting of civilian homes and businesses, or the complicated regional politics fueling the conflict."" Invisible Children addressed the criticisms on its website, saying it simplified a complex crisis. ""KONY 2012 portrays, in no uncertain terms, the image of a madman who manipulates children spiritually for his own tactical gains,"" it said. ""In our quest to garner wide public support of nuanced policy, Invisible Children has sought to explain the conflict in an easily understandable format, focusing on the core attributes of LRA leadership that infringe upon the most basic of human rights. In a 30-minute film, however, many nuances of the 26-year conflict are admittedly lost or overlooked. The film is a first entry point to this conflict for many."" Richard Downie, a fellow and deputy director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, took issue with an approach he said was focused on the white Westerner's ability to parachute in and resolve a problem that Africans are unable to deal with themselves. ""I think by portraying Westerners as the only people who can crack this problem of Joseph Kony -- it's simplistic, it's naive, and it's a little bit condescending as well,"" he said. Criticism aside, ""KONY 2012"" is turning out to be the fastest growing social media video campaign, according to Visible Measures, a company that tracks measures online movements. For perspective, the firm's blog compared ""KONY 2012"" to former video champ Susan Boyle, who has 480 million views. ""It took Boyle six days to reach 70 million views. Kony is tracking a day faster. Even the Old Spice Guy can't keep up. His legendary Responses campaign generated 35 million views in its first week, but it didn't top 70 million views until Christmas 2010, five months after it launched,"" Visible Measures said. ""Crazy,"" said Russell of the video going viral. He's hoping for a billion views. CNN's David McKenzie, Libby Lewis, Brian Todd and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","70 million people have viewed 'KONY 2012'

"(CNN) -- Videos purportedly shot by Britain's Prince Harry and including offensive language prompted an official apology Saturday from the prince and the royal family. Prince Harry apologized when video surfaced of him making offensive comments while on military duty in 2006. According to the British-based News of the World, which released the videos on its Web site, the videos show British soldiers while a voice presumed to be Harry's calls one solider a ""Paki,"" and in another clip tells soldier wearing a cloth on his head that he looks ""like a raghead."" A spokesman for Prince Harry apologized in a statement released by St. James's Palace Saturday after the videos surfaced online. The spokesman said the prince -- who is third in line to the British throne -- ""understands how offensive this term can be, and is extremely sorry for any offense his words might cause."" It is not first apology for offensive behavior by Prince Harry. In 2005, he was photographed wearing a Nazi uniform to a party, for which he said he was sorry. ""It was a very stupid thing to do and I've learned my lesson, simple as that really,"" he said in a September 2005 interview marking his 21st birthday. ""I'd like to put it in the past now. What's done is done. I regret it."" The videos, filmed during his military service in 2006, were shot by the prince, according to the Web site. In one video, a voice from behind the camera says ""Ah, our little Paki Friend...Ahmed,"" as the camera zooms in on a soldier from across the room. The video does not show Prince Harry's face, but News of the World suggests that the voice is his. The soldiers were waiting for their flight to Cyprus for a mission, according to the Web site. The royal family said the 'paki' term was a nickname for a friend in his platoon. ""There is no question that Prince Harry was in any way seeking to insult his friend,"" the St. James's Palace statement said. The second video was filmed after arriving in Cyprus, according to News of the World, and shows a British soldier with a cloth over his head. A voice, which the News of the World claims to be Harry's, is heard saying, ""(expletive) me, you look like a raghead."" In response to that comment, St. James's Palace said, ""Prince Harry used the term 'raghead' to mean Taliban or Iraqi insurgent."" Dickie Arbiter, a former press secretary to Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Harry's grandmother, urged people to take the prince's words in context. ""Harry is not the same man as he was three years ago,"" Arbiter told Britain's ITN network. ""You don't think when you are shooting a video."" And he pointed out that Harry was serving in the army, where language is not always delicate. ""It is quite common for names to be used in the military.... He's a serviceman first and foremost, but people see him as a prince first and he has to be careful of what he says."" The British Ministry of Defense said it was not aware of any complaints against Prince Harry and would investigate the allegations of inappropriate behavior, according to a written statement released Saturday. ""Bullying and racism are not endemic in the Armed Forces,"" it said. CNN's Katy Byron contributed to this report.","Prince Harry apologizes for offensive language used while on duty three years ago .

"(CNN) -- Researchers have solved the first step in treating the common cold, by mapping its entire genome, or genetic map, teams from the University of Maryland and the University of Wisconsin-Madison reported Thursday. The common cold, also known as the human rhinovirus infection . ""We have the pieces all in place. They can't go in any other way. Now we have to understand what the pictures are telling us,"" said Dr. Stephen B. Liggett, professor of medicine and physiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and director of its Cardiopulmonary Genomics Program. The research was published in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday afternoon. Technically known as the human rhinovirus infection, the common cold is responsible for half of all asthma attacks and is a factor in bronchitis, sinusitis, middle-ear infections and pneumonia. The coughs, sneezes and sniffles of colds impose a major health care burden in the United States -- including visits to health care providers, cost of over-the-counter drugs for symptom relief, often-inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and missed work days -- with direct and indirect costs of about $60 billion annually.  How mapping the cold genome may lead to a cure » . ""We generally think of colds as a nuisance, but they can be debilitating in the very young and in older individuals and can trigger asthma attacks at any age,"" Liggett said. ""Also, recent studies indicate that early...infection in children can program their immune system to develop asthma by adolescence."" Finding a cure for the common cold has been elusive. That's because the rhinovirus is so complex. Made up of at least 99 different strains, it can infect different people with different symptoms. Visit CNNhealth.com, your connection for better living. By mapping the genome of the common cold and assembling the results into a ""family tree,"" scientists can see how the virus strains are related, as well as their differences. Liggett, who is also the study's senior author, says this is a breakthrough in solving the common cold puzzle because. ""At least now we have an understanding of which virus one might have."" Now that the pieces are together, drug companies can work on developing new treatments that would either halt or prevent the cold virus before it begins to spread. Researchers found that human rhinoviruses are organized into about 15 small groups. So the idea of one drug fits all probably won't work, Liggett says. ""Our mindset right now is to consider more along the antiviral treatment, rather than vaccines, but always keep an open mind to the new technology of vaccine development."" Investigators are so optimistic with their findings that they predict the development of new drugs within the next two to five years, depending on Food and Drug Administration approval, which could mean one day soon, runny noses caused by colds may be a thing of the past.","Scientists map entire cold virus for first time .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- If you're a tourist arriving in Israel, you might be asked to give authorities a look at your personal e-mail, in addition to your travel documents. Israel's attorney general said Wednesday that Shin Bet, the country's internal security force, can search a foreign traveler's e-mail, but only in exceptional cases in which ""relevant suspicious signs"" are observed. Israel says the practice is another way to fight terrorism. The threat of using foreign citizens for terrorist purposes is a growing trend, the Israeli Attorney General's Office said in a written response to an inquiry filed by an Israeli human rights group. Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry, told CNN: ""Security may under the law demand this, but no one is forced to open their accounts to anyone they don't want to."" However, the attorney general's decision said that if the traveler declined to give consent, it would be made clear that a refusal would be taken into consideration, along with other relevant factors, in deciding whether to allow entry into Israel. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel received the information from the Attorney General's Office after it asked whether Israel's security forces could demand travelers' e-mail and social media passwords. The association said the question was a reaction to media reports last year that several Palestinian-American travelers were asked to open their e-mail accounts and show airport security before being denied entry. The group received an answer this week. ""To be clear, this is a process whose execution is conditioned on the receipt of the passenger's agreement, and that the latter is not required to give the investigating representative his password, as your letter suggests, but rather that the passenger himself executes entry to the e-mail account ... "" The Attorney General's Office wrote. Lila Margalit, an attorney for the Association for Civil Rights, said the practice is a violation of privacy rights: . ""A tourist who has just spent thousands of dollars to travel to Israel, only to be interrogated at the airport by Shin Bet agents and told to grant access to their e-mail account, is in no position to give free and informed consent,"" she said Wednesday. ""Such 'consent,' given under threat of deportation, cannot serve as a basis for such a drastic invasion of privacy. In today's world, access to a person's e-mail account is akin to access to their innermost thoughts and personal lives. Allowing security agents to take such invasive measures at their own discretion and on the basis of such flimsy 'consent' is not befitting of a democracy."" Security checks at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport are known around the world as some of the most exhaustive and thorough, and this is one more layer that travelers should be aware of. Jerusalem Travel Agency owner Margo Tarazi said she had heard of the practice but her clients had not experienced it: . ""None of our clients have faced this problem yet. They come with official groups with their vouchers, and no one asks them about these things. However, if we do receive any groups with some people who are originally from Iran or from Syria, they are detained for several hours and asked to sign a paper not to cause any harm to the state of Israel during their visit."" Critics of the practice worry it will be used to target Arabs or Muslims who communicate with Palestinian activists or organizations.","Israeli attorney general says travelers' e-mail can be searched in exceptional cases .

"(CNN) -- The last time you flew, did you wonder what's really going on behind that closed cockpit door? Who's actually flying the plane? Is it a human being, or Capt. Autopilot? Based on its record, America leads the commercial airline industry in safety. And for most passengers, that information alone provides all the confidence in the world. But there will always be nervous fliers who need to know: Who are they trusting with their lives, human or machine? ""There are millions of people out there who are under the impression that the airplane is flying itself and the pilots are only there in case something goes wrong,"" says Patrick Smith, a 22-year veteran commercial pilot who blogs about airline issues. This, says Smith, is the big lie. It's true that airline computers and electronic control systems allow pilots to fly ""hands off"" beginning soon after takeoff, continuing through the flight route and -- in very rare cases -- all the way through touchdown. But Smith says that doesn't mean the planes fly themselves. One day, Smith was flying as a passenger when that false impression really hit him square in the face. The airliner glided to a particularly smooth landing, and a ""smart Alec"" seated a few rows behind Smith shouted, ""Nice job, autopilot!"" ""Everybody around us started cackling,"" Smith said. ""While it was funny, it was wrong. And I knew that he meant it. It was frustrating."" Even Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger enjoyed the backup of computer autopilot during his famous ""miracle on the Hudson"" emergency landing three years ago. Sullenberger was in the pilot's seat when his Airbus A320 collided with a flock of geese and lost thrust 2,700 feet over Manhattan. Computer-assisted flight systems were active, Sullenberger said, but there was no need for them. ""We never got to the extremes where [flight control computers] would have protected us"" from pointing the plane's nose too high, or going too fast or too slow, he told CNN last week. ""We didn't need any of it."" In fact, flight control computers actually hindered the landing, said Sullenberger, who's now a CBS News aviation and safety consultant. Flight software prevented him from keeping the plane's nose a little higher during the last four seconds before he ditched US Airways Flight 1549 in the icy Hudson River. ""So we hit harder than we would have, had we been able to keep the nose up,"" he said. ""That was a little-known part of the software that no airline operators or pilots knew about."" Of course, most passengers never experience that kind of emergency. During a normal flight, there's no way to know when your pilots are using computer-programmed automatic flight systems. Smith described what goes on behind the cockpit's closed door. Hands-on flying hasn't disappeared, he said -- it's just different. For example, setting up and executing an automatic descent has changed. ""In the old days, you had your hand on the wheel and you pushed the nose down and adjusted the power accordingly,"" he said. ""Now, you've got to hold a different set of buttons and dials and switches, but in the end, you're still doing the same thing -- you're still flying the plane."" ""None of it is easy,"" he said. ""In a lot of ways, it's more difficult because airplanes are so much more complex now."" Sure, there's a lot of ""hands-off"" time, but there are also many tasks that surround the management of the airplane and its computerized systems. ""You're utilizing a different skill set."" Some fear that airliner pilots rely too much on autopilot technology, saying that such a reliance leads to lack of practice and infrequent use of manual piloting skills. Experts have suggested this may have been a factor in the mysterious Atlantic crash of Air France Flight 447 from Brazil to Paris, which killed 228 passengers and crew. As technology becomes more and more sophisticated -- and trusted -- an expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says commercial airliners could one day be piloted by remote control. ""We fly many unmanned air vehicles around the world today, mainly for military or small airplane applications,"" said R. John Hansman, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics, and head of the Division of Humans and Automation, at MIT. ""At a technical level, there's no reason why we couldn't do that with a commercial airplane."" Far-fetched? Hansman isn't the only one in the airline community talking about this. At an aeronautical conference last August, James Albaugh, a Boeing president and CEO, announced that a ""pilotless airliner is going to come; it's just a question of when. You'll see it in freighters first, over water probably, landing very close to the shore,"" according to IEEE Spectrum magazine. The idea won't be widely accepted until at least a couple of generations from now, said Hansman, who's also a licensed private pilot. But experts are already planning how it might work. There are two basic academic models. In one, pilots would fly airliners by remote control from ""cockpits"" on the ground -- just as pilots currently fly Predator military drones over Afghanistan and along the U.S.-Mexican border. ""There's another model where you might have a flight attendant sufficiently trained,"" said Hansman, to act as a backup pilot on automated or remote-controlled airliners. Yes, you read that right. There's an idea out there to have backup pilots who also serve passengers peanuts and tomato juice. ""There are people who discuss that,"" Hansman said. ""I don't know if that's particularly realistic."" Frustration is the word Smith uses to describe this kind of talk from ""aerospace academics, researchers, professors, consultants and other smart people who often have a very limited grasp of the day-to-day operational realities of commercial flying."" That's not to sound arrogant, Smith said, ""but it's a theoretical discussion for researchers and scientists, and it's not anything with any practical application at this point."" ""It's wrong on so many levels that it's hard to get my arms around it and explain,"" he said with exasperation. ""And for what? You'd still need human beings to operate these planes remotely. Thus, I'm not sure what the benefit of this would be in terms of cost."" Cost might actually be an argument against it. Building necessary infrastructure would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, Smith said. It's like saying we should get rid of surgeons in the operating room because of advances in medical technology, he said. ""I think there's something about flying that brings out this remote-control fantasy in people,"" said Smith. ""I don't exactly know where it comes from."" As MIT's Hansman explained it, pilotless airliners would simply be the end result of the current evolution of flight deck staffing. Here's what he means: Improved technology has contributed to shrinking cockpit staff. According to Hansman, before the Boeing 757 began service in the 1980s, most large airliners had a standard flight deck staff of three. They were the pilot, co-pilot and a flight engineer who managed pressurization, heating, fuel and pneumatic systems. Then, Hansman said, ""those systems became automated, and the standard flight deck crew went from three to two."" Going from two to one pilot would be a difficult threshold for the airline community to cross. Two onboard pilots allow for a safety net -- a redundancy, he said -- to ensure sound judgment calls and to protect against possible incapacitation of the pilot -- for example in case of sickness or an accident. But going from two to zero is another thing altogether. ""It's not clear that anybody would want to ride on an airplane that doesn't have a crew on board,"" Hansman said. Would Hansman? No. ""Not at this point,"" he said. No matter how trustworthy the technology becomes, Hansman said remote-controlled airliners will never become reality without widespread public acceptance. But he doesn't rule out that possibility. ""You have to remember, nobody thinks twice about getting onto an automated train, for example, at the airport."" This isn't all conjecture, though. To be sure, unmanned aircraft are coming soon to airspace near you. In fact, it may not be long before you see remote-controlled drones flying over your neighborhood. The Federal Aviation Administration plans to begin flight testing and writing rules aimed at integrating unmanned aircraft into the national airspace system as soon as 2015. Some of these might include flying drones with sophisticated cameras like the Draganflyer, which can be used for police search and rescue, or unmanned crop-dusters. By 2018, the nation's unmanned aircraft could number more than 15,500, according to industry projections. Aerospace contractor Northrop Grumman is developing an unmanned combat jet the size of a fighter plane. If successful, the X-47B would claim two firsts for an unmanned jet: in-flight fueling capability, and launch and landing aboard Navy aircraft carriers. For Sullenberger -- perhaps the nation's most famous pilot -- the idea of remote-controlled airliners triggers a lot of critical questions. He speculated about what might have happened to Flight 1549 after it collided with the geese if the plane had been controlled by a remote pilot. ""What if the geese damaged whatever forward viewing devices there were -- such as cameras or infrared or radar? What if the damage prevented the operator from seeing the river? Or seeing the plane's height above the river?"" How would the operator be able to land the plane safely? ""On every airplane I've ever flown, I tend to use the technology to its full capabilities when it's appropriate,"" Sullenberger said. ""But looking as far into the future as I can see, every airplane -- no matter how sophisticated -- really needs to be flown, and flown very well, by a human pilot.""","Autopilot myths confuse passengers about pilot control, expert says .

"(CNN) -- I am, by no means, a regular patron of strip clubs. But because my show, ""This is Life,"" explores different American subcultures without expressing opinion or judgment, I found myself in quite a few of them this year for the upcoming episode ""Road Strip,"" a window into the world of traveling strippers. Stripping is hardly a new profession, but the Internet has allowed women who work in it to more easily access large groups of men congregating for leisure or for business: sporting events like the Super Bowl or Final Four championships, even political events like the Republican National Convention. But because of the nature of what they do -- taking their clothes off for money -- strippers have been and will likely continue to be some of the most stigmatized members of society. I haven't really known too many strippers throughout my lifetime, but I've admittedly fallen into the trap of not feeling particularly respectful of women who use their bodies to earn a living. Perhaps it's because of my perennial disdain for the objectification of women. But what happens when women themselves decide on their own to capitalize on their assets? During the course of shooting this episode, I met many different kinds of women, but one thing was present in all of them: ambition. For some of the women, stripping allows them to make more money than other day jobs. Some dancers use the job to put themselves through school, like Antonia Crane, who earned her master's degree in literature and creative writing. Others take advantage of the flexible schedule, like mothers who want to spend more time with their children. I don't know any other job that allows for this kind of flexibility in schedule. If I want to spend more time with my child, I can't just choose when I work. Many dancers can. They dance when they need money, but no one determines their hours but themselves. At many clubs, they are independent contractors who pay a percentage to the clubs for allowing them to dance there, but the rest of what they make goes into their pockets. That's not to say it's an easy life. The money can be highly unpredictable. A couple of dancers told me that there have been many nights when they've returned home with less money than they left with, because guys just weren't feeling very generous. Trying to remain upbeat and engaged is essential, even if you're not having a great day. A good stripper is skilled in many art forms that go far beyond taking her clothes off. In many cases, she is a therapist or even a shoulder to cry on. Strip clubs have reputations for being havens for drugs and sex trafficking for a reason -- pimps have been known to force women to work as strippers. But the clubs I visited do not condone drug use or prostitution. The former manager of Thee DollHouse in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, told me that if he as much as suspects that a girl is being run by a pimp, he'll throw them both out. So how did I feel in strip clubs? Frankly, I was utterly mesmerized. There is an art to seduction, and even if you've been married for decades or you're a devoted churchgoer, every one of us harbors the desire to be able to seduce or excite -- even our long-term partner. The way these women's bodies move, the manner in which they play with their patrons: They are veritable masters of seduction, which is something that seems to have unquestionable value. So, why shouldn't these women capitalize on it? A couple of nights, I went back to my hotel room to see if I could mimic some of the things I'd seen in the clubs. I have a long way to go. But it was fun. It felt -- sexy. In all relationships, we long to be able to maintain our partner's attraction. Let's be honest, it takes work, especially if the relationship has spanned years and multiple children. A club owner told me that often, men spend time in his establishments and report going home to much friskier interactions with their wives. Whether that is true or not, I know I was struck by how much sexier I felt. I wonder what would happen if we checked our opinions at the door? If we're lucky enough, we might run across someone like Antonia Crane and be able to discuss and debate whether Shakespeare's ""Dark Lady"" was, in fact, a woman of ill repute -- and be thoroughly excited and entertained while at it. Perhaps we could learn something. I know I did.","Lisa Ling goes inside the lives of four traveling strippers .

"(CNN) -- Who wouldn't be interested in a choose-your-own-adventure sex farce or ""Top Gun: The Musicial""? Those are just two of the performances on tap at fringe festivals this summer. Such festivals have their roots in Scotland. Upon its launch in 1947, the Edinburgh International Festival of performing arts was eclipsed by a more grassroots event. In makeshift venues around the city -- ""round the fringe"" of the official performing arts festival, one journalist put it -- artists began mounting small-scale, independent performances. The ""fringe festival"" concept was born. This freewheeling style of celebrating the arts is finally gaining a foothold in America: the U.S. Association of Fringe Festivals lists 24 annual events in its directory; of these, half are 5 years old or less. Fringes are generally distinguished by short, unconventional performances, low-cost tickets and a large share of ticket sales returned to artists. Many open their stages to amateurs as well as seasoned acts. ""Fringes are supposed to be risky, even for the organizers. Otherwise, what's the fun?"" asks Atlanta Fringe's Chris Alonzo. Most festivals sell buttons or badges for a small fee that act as a festival pass; individual shows are priced separately. Here are nine U.S. fringes you might dip into for your dose of culture this summer: . Orlando International Fringe . May 14-27 in Orlando . Perhaps appropriately, given its Disney proximity, the country's longest-running fringe also encompasses the largest kids' fringe in the United States. It's also notable for its international reputation for ""innovative LGBT content,"" says festival producer Michael Marinaccio. This year's tag line is ""Over 100 Shows Rated G Through OMG."" Among them, all chosen by lottery: a ""choose-your-own-adventure sex farce,"" a historical magic show and a play about a soul-searching Aqua Man. Buttons are $9; show tickets are $3-$11. www.orlandofringe.org . PortFringe . June 24-29 in Portland, Maine . Since 2012, tourists have had another reason to descend on Maine in summer. Portland's PortFringe includes 60 acts and more than 100 performances, held in a variety of bars and clubs as well as theaters. With staggered show times, patrons can be seen ""running from one venue to another...[it's] a level of energy and excitement you don't normally associate with theater,"" says co-founder Deirdre Fulton. Acts are selected by lottery, with local artists heavily represented; the tentative schedule ranges from puppet improv to ""The Rantings of a Very Hungry Frenchman"" who hands out cheese samples. Tickets are $10, with discounts on multishow passes. www.portfringe.com . Hollywood Fringe . June 12-29 in Los Angeles . Taking a ""free-for-all approach,"" this California festival does not select artists, but instead facilitates cooperation between would-be performers and willing venues. With more than 800 performances and 17,000 seats, its menu is extensive; this year's includes a TED Talks-skewering play called ""Death by PowerPoint"" and a one-woman ""comedy tell-a-thon/telethon"" dedicated to ""Combating Adult Virginity."" Shows are held at small theaters, studios and cafes; buttons are $5 and get you $1 off tickets, with other perks. Performers and venues determine show length as well as ticket prices (generally $10-$15); many shows have pay-what-you-will performances. hollywoodfringe.org . Capital Fringe . July 10-27 in Washington . Taking place within three downtown blocks in Washington, Capital Fringe is headquartered with offices and a pop-up ""gypsy tent bar"" near Mount Vernon Square. This year, a series of inaugural site-specific works have been selected, such as Madeleine Cutrona's ""Bargain Basement University,"" a peddler's cart Cutrona will use to distribute ""advanced degrees"" to passersby around town. Buttons are $5 in advance, $7 during the festival; show tickets $17. www.capitalfringe.org . St. Lou Fringe . June 18-22 in St. Louis . ""Hyperlocally focused,"" according to founder and executive director Em Piro, the St. Lou Fringe is concentrated into just a few clustered venues in an effort to bring the larger St. Louis community together. ""We're trying to build that critical mass,"" Piro said. ""We want people to come to the grounds and linger."" Selection is determined through a mixture of first-come, first-served and lottery. This year's offerings include a didgeridoo performance, an improvised biography by a comedy troupe and a burlesque show entitled ""A Pastie Home Companion."" Badges are $5; tickets are $12 or less. www.stlfringe.com . Minnesota Fringe Festival . July 31-August 10 in Minneapolis and St. Paul . Since its 1993 founding, this Twin Cities festival has remained uncensored and uncurated. This year's lineup includes a Bollywood dance show, a Tennessee Williams adaptation and ""Top Gun: The Musical."" ""It's not uncommon to see groups of people (often strangers) huddled in a lobby or on the sidewalk exchanging reviews ... or trying to figure out what the must-see show of the festival is,"" says Executive Director Jeff Larson. Tickets are $12 adults, $5 children; adults also need a $4 button. www.fringefestival.org . Atlanta Fringe Festival . June 5-8 in Atlanta . This festival picks acts out of an honest-to-goodness hat. The idea is to ensure ""that the festival isn't limited by our own personal biases,"" says marketing manager Alonzo. This year 22 shows will cover belly dancing, stand-up comedy and cabaret, among other genres. A preview party on the eve of the festival offers three-minute excerpts from each show. Buttons are $3 and are good for Atlanta arts discounts year round; tickets are $10. www.atlantafringe.org . New York International Fringe Festival . August 8-24 in New York . Not surprisingly, the city that's home to the Off-Off Broadway movement -- a reaction to large, commercial theater -- hosts the country's biggest fringe. Like New York, this festival is busy, encompassing 1,200 performances; it's also high stakes, with commercial producers and casting agents scouting around (festival alums include Bradley Cooper and Mindy Kaling). Entry is adjudicated, with about 20% of applicant companies accepted to perform. Established writers, directors and actors participate, but ticket prices are still low by New York standards: $15 in advance, $18 at the door. Shows cover everything from multimedia and mime to opera and ballet; full schedule announced in July. www.fringenyc.org . Sideshow Fringe . July 31-August 3 in Nashville . This Nashville festival takes its name from its area of special emphasis: variety and circus arts. ""We have been fortunate to have a strong community of aerial dancers, jugglers, puppeteers and more that join us each festival,"" says program director Jessika Malone. Previously open-access, entry is now juried except for three lottery-determined spots (lineup TBA). Buttons are $5; tickets are $10. www.sideshowfringe.com .","U.S. fringe festivals showcase unconventional performances .

"Washington (CNN) -- The front end of HealthCare.gov is working better, but many problems identified in the days after its launch persist, according to a team of Web engineers. Media Temple is a private web-hosting company that analyzed the public-facing side of the site days after its disastrous October 1 launch, and again this week for CNN. ""It's getting better, but it looks like there's still a lot to do,"" Media Temple president and COO Russ Reeder said. ""So whether that's three weeks or three months, I can't tell."" A week after the site went live, a team of Reeder's engineers found a slew of out-of-date Web applications, poorly written code, testing code and unnecessary data transmitted to users at each login that should have been stored on local servers or computers for quicker access through a process called caching. House passes proposed GOP Obamacare changes . All of these mistakes broke with best practices for Web coding. ""They're not following the proper protocol when you deal with a website that's going to get a lot of traffic,"" Reeder said on October 8. More than a month later, many of these problems still exist. ""So far, it does not look like much has changed on the front end,"" one engineer wrote in his analysis. The site is still not properly routing data to servers closer to individual users, a practice that helps speed up response times, but is still sending information to too many unnecessary third-party web tools, although there appear to be fewer than in the early days, he continued. It is still loading far too much unnecessary code and there still appears to be needless testing code in the final front-end product. Obamacare: What now? Jeff Zients, the management expert brought in by the White House to oversee the site's repair, repeated the administration's assurances that ""most users"" will be able to navigate from start to enrollment by the end of the month. ""As we prioritize fixes on HealthCare.gov, we focus on system performance and functionality, things like site stability, speed and usability that make a real difference to the consumer,"" Zeints told reporters on a conference call on Friday. ""But to be clear as you would experience with any major new site, new bugs and other glitches will surface in December and beyond and as they surface we will fix them,"" he said. Two of the engineers who participated in the second analysis wrote that things were getting better. The site looks ""a lot cleaner,"" one wrote, and another noted that there was less extra code than last time he looked. ""You can tell from the website that there are people working it and making changes,"" Reeder said. ""And those changes are good. There are still many changes they can still make."" Reeder and his team had no special access to the back-end of HealthCare.gov, where most of the functionality problems exist. All of these mistakes are visible from the end, Reeder emphasized, which raises questions about the structure of rest of the site. Bachmann: I lost my insurance under Obamacare . The Obama administration official in charge of overseeing the site, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Director Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, testified at a congressional hearing earlier this month that HealthCare.gov would be ""fully functioning"" by the end of the month. But Obama, himself, appeared to lower expectations on Thursday when he discussed the issue with reporters. ""The website will work much better on November 30th, December 1st, than it worked certainly on October 1st,"" he said before quickly acknowledging, ""That's a pretty low bar."" ""The majority of people who go to the website will see a website that is working the way it's supposed to,"" he continued. ""I think it is not possible for me to guarantee that 100 percent of the people 100 percent of the time going on this website will have a perfectly seamless, smooth experience. We're going to have to continue to improve it even after November 30th, December 1st.""","""It's getting better but it looks like there's still a lot to do,"" analyst says of HealthCare.gov .

"(CNN) -- Sectarian violence has sparked a ""serious"" human rights situation in western Myanmar, a U.N. envoy said. Tomas Quintana, the U.N.'s human rights rapporteur for Myanmar, called for an independent investigation into allegations that authorities are using excessive force and committing other human rights violations while trying to restore order in Rakhine state. ""While I am in no position to be able to verify these allegations at this point in time, they are of grave concern,"" Quintana said Saturday after completing a six-day visit to the country that included a trip to the western state, where a surge in sectarian violence between Buddhists and Muslims in recent months has left dozens dead and displaced thousands. Rakhine is home to the Rohingya, an ethnic Muslim minority who say they have been persecuted the Myanmar military during its decades of authoritarian rule. On Saturday, Quintana said an investigation in Rakhine is important to guarantee accountability. ""Reconciliation will not be possible without this, and exaggerations and distortions will fill the vacuum to further fuel distrust and tensions between communities,"" he said. Quintana also called for the release of six United Nations staff members in prison who were detained ""in connection with events"" in the state. ""I am of the view that the charges against them are unfounded and that their due process rights have been denied,"" he said. Their detention comes at a time that Myanmar has released hundreds of political prisoners, including opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and instituted a series of political reforms after decades of repressive military rule. Western governments have responded to the efforts by easing sanctions on the country. Violence between Buddhists and Muslims erupted in Rakhine in June, after police detained three Muslim men in relation to the rape and killing of a Buddhist woman. Two of the men were sentenced to death, the government-run newspaper New Light of Myanmar reported on its website. A third man hanged himself while in detention on June 9. News of the crime appears to have motivated several hundred people to attack a bus in Rakhine in early June, killing 10 Muslims who were on board. Violence between Buddhists and Muslims then spread across the northern part of the state, resulting in the destruction of thousands of homes and the deaths of about 50 people, according to the government. The national government declared a state of emergency in Rakhine, bringing in the military to help restore order. The unrest has tested the efforts of President Thein Sein's administration to seek reconciliation with Myanmar's different ethnic groups and move the country toward more democratic governance. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","A U.N. envoy calls for an independent investigation into allegations of abuses .

"Anderson, South Carolina (CNN) -- Marco Rubio came to South Carolina this week hoping to win over the kind of conservative hardliners who turned on him last year as the Senate immigration reform bill he sponsored hit a roadblock in the Republican-controlled House. By the time Rubio addressed a massive GOP fundraiser here on Monday evening, it wasn't his right flank he had to worry about. The Florida senator and likely presidential candidate was the headline speaker at a ""Faith and Freedom"" barbecue fundraiser for Rep. Jeff Duncan, the tea party-backed congressman who represents what many Republicans consider the most conservative House district in the state. After a succession of speeches from South Carolina Republican notables like Sen. Lindsey Graham and Gov. Nikki Haley, Rubio took the stage in Anderson to applause, but was quickly interrupted by a group of protestors -- self-identified DREAMers, young immigrants brought to the country illegally as minors -- who loudly heckled the senator for abandoning last year's sweeping immigration package when it was met with harsh resistance on the right. For an ambitious Republican looking to prove his conservative bona fides and rub out the stain of working with Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid, the interruption was something of a gift. A plugged-in Republican operative turned to a reporter and observed dryly, ""I couldn't think of a better way to make Rubio look good in South Carolina."" The audience of nearly 1,200 conservatives jeered the protestors as Rubio waited for them to be escorted out of the Anderson Civic Center, scolding them in the process. ""We are a sovereign country that deserves to have immigration laws,"" Rubio said. ""You're doing harm to your own cause because you don't have a right to illegally immigrate to the United States."" The crowd cheered him on. One elderly audience member shoved a protester as he weaved his way through the tables. Another, 73-year old Army veteran Turk Culberson, angrily stalked them out of the building, clutching his cane as if it were a baseball bat. ""I let my temper get the better of me,"" Culberson said after the incident. ""But there was no place for that kind of thing. If you don't want to hear what he has to say, don't come."" Rubio plunges into immigration debate . The remainder of Rubio's speech cemented his standing with the deeply Republican crowd. A member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees, Rubio has championed a muscular foreign policy and tapped hawkish neoconservative thinkers as his foreign policy advisers. He spent much of the evening lambasting President Barack Obama's handling of overseas affairs, from the Middle East to Asia. ""If you want to know the state of the world today, it is chaos,"" he said. He pivoted to cultural issues, blasting tax laws that discourage marriage and a culture that regards divorce as no big deal. ""The most important job we have is not congressman or senator or governor,"" he said. ""It's family and mother and husband and wife."" Though several attendees said they had lingering questions about his immigration stance and wanted to hear more from him in the coming months, most of the Republicans who spoke to CNN complimented his speech. ""That crowd was with him 100%,"" said MaryAnn Riley, a longtime member of the Spartanburg County Republican Women. Riley, though, cautioned that she was open to supporting other potential Republican presidential candidates, naming Rick Perry and even former GOP nominee Mitt Romney as possible choices. Duncan, who fiercely opposed Rubio's immigration efforts in 2013, said the senator ""will have to explain"" his position to South Carolinians if he seeks the GOP nomination. But Duncan had kind words for the man who graced his fundraiser. ""Marco Rubio believes in faith and freedom,"" he said. Graham, a fellow hawk in the Senate, was more generous in his remarks. He described Rubio as ""the son of Ronald Reagan when it comes to national security."" Just as important as Rubio's public appearance were the carefully-curated private meetings that his advisers arranged prior to the dinner speech. South Carolina back in 2016 spotlight . In his first trip to South Carolina since addressing a GOP fundraiser in Columbia two summers ago, Rubio spent the day in a series of closed-door sessions with influential local activists and potential financial backers, specifically courting the Christian conservatives who dominate grassroots Republican politics in the South Carolina upstate. Rubio advisers organized a meeting for the senator with senior officials from Bob Jones University, making Rubio the first Republican presidential contender to cultivate leaders at the famed Christian university. He also entertained questions from over 40 social conservatives at the Greenville home of Lisa van Riper, the well-connected president of South Carolina Citizens For Life. Tony Beam, the host of a drive-time Christian talk radio show that broadcasts throughout the upstate, said Rubio spoke for 10 minutes about ""bedrock conservative values"" while at Van Riper's home, stressing his opposition to same-sex marriage, before taking questions. Beam said he was ""very moved"" by Rubio's remarks, comparing the 43-year old Cuban-American to Ronald Reagan. ""I was very impressed with his grasp of the issues,"" Beam said. ""But the thing that impressed me most was his optimism and belief in America, the kind that I first heard from Ronald Reagan when I was a kid in college. That's what I've been searching for. That's something that's missing in conservative messaging today. I was very moved."" Rubio, too, held a Greenville fundraiser for his political operation, Reclaim America PAC, which has so far spent half a million dollars on behalf of Republican candidates in 2014. The event attracted donors and business leaders from around the state, as well as another member of the South Carolina congressional delegation, Rep. Trey Gowdy. Still, Rubio brushed off questions about his presidential aspirations in a session with reporters, giving them a pat answer about waiting until after the midterms before making a decision about a White House run. He did take a moment to bash Hillary Clinton, the putative Democratic frontrunner. ""She is responsible for at least four of the six yeas of this disastrous foreign policy,"" he said. ""She was the secretary of state, the chief foreign policy officer of the Obama administration at a time when it is now universally accepted that his policy is a fiasco."" That comment drew a feisty retort from Clinton allies, who accused Rubio of pandering to ""right-wing extremists."" ""He flip-flopped on his own immigration bill to keep them satisfied, thinks minimum wage doesn't work and said Medicare and Social Security 'weakened us as a people,'"" said Adrienne Watson, spokeswoman for the pro-Clinton super PAC Correct The Record. ""Americans are looking for a leader like Hillary Clinton to unite us, increase mobility and move our country forward."" As for the immigration flare-up earlier in the evening, Rubio stuck to his guns, saying that a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants is impossible without first securing the border and then re-structuring the current immigration system. ""I don't know of anyone in Washington who has taken more criticism for supporting elements of what they are asking for,"" he said. ""But what they are asking for and insisting upon is unrealistic. This notion that we are going to pass some kind of blanket amnesty is not realistic."" Outside the civic center, one of the immigration hecklers -- Charlotte, North Carolina, resident Oliver Merino -- promised to hound Rubio with similar protests wherever he goes. Merino, a member of the DREAM Organizing Network, a group that works to halt immigrant deportations, scoffed at the notion that Rubio could win over Hispanic voters if he secures the Republican nomination. ""He wants people like me to be deported,"" Merino said. ""He doesn't stand with our community. We want people to know that. Wherever he goes, we will let him know that.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry has passed the first stage of training to become a military helicopter pilot, following in the footsteps of his brother William, royal officials said Thursday. Harry spent three months in Afghanistan earlier this year. Harry, third in line to the British throne, will now begin a two-and-a-half year course with the Army Air Corps in January 2009, that could result in him seeing active service as a pilot, according to a press statement. The 24-year-old prince, who has spent time in Afghanistan as a member of the British Army's Household Cavalry, qualified for the course by flying a light aircraft under instruction, the statement said. ""If Prince Harry qualifies as an Army Air Corps pilot, he will, like any officer, be available for operational service wherever the AAC flies,"" it said. Harry's elder brother William was awarded his Royal Air Force wings in April after training since January. William's training attracted controversy when he landed Chinook helicopter in a field on the property owned by his girlfriend Kate Middleton's family. Defense officials said the flight had been authorized. In September, it was announced William is to train to become a full-time search and rescue pilot with the RAF. William and Harry's father, Prince Charles, and uncle, the Duke of York, have also learned to pilot military helicopters. Prince Harry, who holds the rank of lieutenant, spent three months in Afghanistan earlier this year. He had to be withdrawn in March after his secret deployment was revealed in a media report.","Prince Harry has qualified to train as a military helicopter pilot .

"(CNN) -- In front of the camera, Wayne Brady has won awards for making people laugh. But behind the camera, the comedic talent has been struggling with depression. It was a battle that he kept to himself until an interview Monday with ""Entertainment Tonight,"" when he said that Robin Williams' recent death made him realize how important it was to speak publicly about facing depression. Williams, who had been dealing with severe depression, was found dead of an apparent suicide in August at the age of 63. ""I think that when you keep these secrets, and something that you learn as you read more and go into treatments and get help is, that these secrets kill,"" Brady told ""ET"" Monday. ""Nobody wants to out themselves, so to speak. Or if they out themselves, it's in a very Hollywood way. ... If someone says, 'I'm clinically depressed,' that sounds like someone's making something up."" And when you have a job like Brady's, some assume that you wouldn't be prone to depression to begin with. ""I just did my 1,001st show of 'Let's Make A Deal.' But then I would turn it into this thing of, 'man, I'm doing ""Let's Make A Deal"" when I could be doing this sitcom,' "" Brady said. ""Folks think, 'Wayne Brady's always happy.' No, I'm not always happy, because I'm human."" Depression was a factor when Brady's marriage ended in 2006, but it wasn't until his 42nd birthday in June that Brady knew he needed to seek help. ""I was there by myself, in my bedroom, and had a complete breakdown,"" Brady said. ""When I say breakdown, go ahead and imagine for yourself. Just a brother in his underwear, in his room crying. On that birthday was the beginning of 'OK, I've got to make a change.' "" Now, Brady says he hopes that his admission will help someone else. ""I talked about it (because) I know not everyone is lucky enough to have a support system to talk, and and you may have a wall up that stands between you and help,"" Brady said. ""It may be pride, cultural stigma, shame or just plain old 'I've got this!' I've had all the above! If me talking about my personal journey helps someone, it's all worth it. I'm very blessed to have a great job and family. I can now appreciate all of it much more. I love being able to bring those laughs to other (people) daily and laughing for real myself."" .","TV personality Wayne Brady opened up on his battle with depression .

"(CNN) -- Call it Abu Dhabi's ivory tower. The 35-story white skyscraper stands tall overlooking the mangroves of this oil rich emirate which is the capital of the United Arab Emirates. It was the venue for what was arguably the most important corporate press conference this year in the UAE. The subject at hand was the construction firm Arabtec. At the front of the room, board members who represent the ""who's who"" of Abu Dhabi trading families: Qubaisi, Fahim, Suwaidi and Mehari. The major backer of Arabtec is the state run investment group Aabar, which is one of the many funds controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Presidential Affairs, and the owner of, amongst other trophy assets, Manchester City Football Club. Until a month ago, this company was not on anybody's global radar, even though the Dubai-based group is well known around these parts. It has built the new global landmarks like the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest tower, and the world's most expensive hotel to be constructed, the Emirates Palace. It is also busy putting up the Louvre Abu Dhabi, part of a $25 billion cultural district in the city. Interest inside and outside the country has been swirling around Arabtec and Dubai's stock exchange for the past month, especially after the market achieved an upgrade to MSCI's emerging market index in June. But with a global upgrade comes international scrutiny for a company and stock market that many fund managers say are falling short on both transparency and corporate governance. The press event was somewhat surreal. Players representing billions of dollars of investment trying to clear up how a former CEO Hasan Ismaik accumulated 28% of the stock without either the company or the Dubai Financial Market raising any red flags. An Arabic reporter I know was told before the press conference that we could all take our TV cameras in, but not have any audio. That idea was quickly dropped. Six board members were present, but Arabtec Chairman Khadem Al Qubaisi did all the talking during this hour long affair. What emerged was a man out to clear the air. He said Arabtec has not seen one project cancellation and that Arabtec will in future do what it does best and that is construction -- and not venture into oil and gas as the previous leadership had planned. The chairman told me, during a chat we had after the conference, that the former CEO used a handful of company vehicles to become the biggest shareholder to date. ""This guy decided to gather all the shares, because they are linked to Mr. Hassan,"" Qubaisi said. ""This is what I understood. But to be frank with you to speak about the details, I don't know."" That is not a big confidence builder for an MSCI listed company. We still don't know, despite it being probed, where Ismaik got the money to buy so much stock. But when I asked Qubaisi about whether he has unearthed any impropriety, he told me: ""There is nothing. We are only putting the system right now, but there is an auditor there, compliance system, everything there, but our job is to improve it."" Improving transparency to global standards will be a challenge, but Arabtec's order book seems to be healthy according to an analyst report put out today. There is a backlog of some $16 billion according to HSBC and the construction group has been anointed by Abu Dhabi to build $40 billion of low income housing in Egypt to support the new government there. That as they say is good business by any global standard. Read more from John Defterios: . Iraq's 'new reality' shakes global oil markets .

"(CNN) -- There's a children's book from 1977 called The Big Orange Splot. In it, all the houses on one block look the same. Until one day, when a pelican drops a bucket of orange paint on one roof. Instead of painting over it, and returning to the status quo, Mr. Plumbean decorates the roof—and then the facade, and then the yard—with wild, rainbow patterns. His neighbors think he's lost his mind. But one by one they see the beauty in individual expression, however weird and wacky it may look at first. The popular book sounds like an allegory about communism, and conformist lifestyles. And as it turns out, something similar happened in the Hungarian countryside in the 1960s, during the height of communism. The result—those decorated houses—are the subject of Hungarian Cubes, by Katharina Roters. From 1965 to 1988, János Kádár ran things in Hungary. Unlike the leaders of the other Eastern Bloc countries, Kádár practiced a sort of relaxed strain of communism: the Hungarian People's Republic had a free market, and was tolerant (more than Stalin, at least) of individual voices and public dissent. These policies ultimately became known as ""Goulash Communism."" It's fitting, then, that during the Goulash Communism era, a peculiar architectural trend took off: People started painting the facades of their houses with abstract shapes, in wild shades of color. It might be more accurate to say a decorating, or public art movement, began to take off, because the architecture style in question began in the 1920s, long before Kádár's time. It followed the principles of Communist urban planning: city blocks filled with square, economical row houses. They were designed for efficiency, meaning every house was the same, and every house was boring. That didn't last forever. In Hungarian Cubes, Roters documents those countryside row houses during Kádár's reign, after residents started freewheeling with colors and shapes to make it so no two houses looked like. Roters noticed the painted ""Magyar Kocka"", or Hungarian Cube, houses in 2003 after moving from Germany to a small Hungarian town. Some of the homes have trompe l'oeil paintings around the window, like facsimiles of shutters or trimming. Others look like abstracted images of sun rays, or harvested crops. ""Today you can buy a car you like, you can do everything you like. In this uniform world where people were not allowed to have some individuality, you had to wait for the same car as your neighbor,"" Roters says. ""The facade is what I can show to the outside to the world. This was a free space at this time where the people can show and express their individuality."" Roters has spent years photographing the Magyar Kocka houses. She's met some of the original owners, but also is watching as the Cube houses undergo renovations and new paint jobs. ""The intellectual elite in Hungary they hate the kind of housing and the period and the ornamental decoration,"" Roters says. In Hungarian Cubes, she writes: ""In the eyes of the rural population, these houses are simply no longer up-to-date and are therefore...these witnesses to a way of life are slowly but surely disappearing."" The houses are a relic of some rare individualism during a time of homogeneous, community-centric thinking. Hungarian Cubes is available here, through Park Books. Read more from WIRED: .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon's plans to do away with 1970s-era A-10 ""Warthog"" attack planes will have a ripple effect in places like Knob Noster, Missouri -- a small town in the shadow of Whiteman Air Force Base. It could mean fewer reservists flocking to places like the Panther Steakhouse and the EconoLodge after a weekend spent working with planes designed to fight wars against Soviet tanks. In Knob Noster, population 2,709, it makes a big difference when those people spend that cash. ""There are people who maintain the planes and people who come in and do their Reserve duty,"" said Doug Kermick, the city administrator. ""When it comes to these guys being here, all the hotels in the surrounding areas are full. They eat here. They sleep here. From an economic standpoint, there will be some loss."" So lawmakers like Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt and his Democratic colleague, Sen. Claire McCaskill, will do what they often to when faced with steep budgetary cuts that will cause pain back home: fight. Both senators and 10 other lawmakers wrote Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel expressing their ""deep concern with the Department of the Army's proposal to cut Army National Guard combat aviation assets and force structure."" Most of the senators -- many of whom sit on powerful funding or defense-related committees and subcommittees -- represent states with military bases with aviation components. In addition to Blunt and McCaskill, the lawmakers include Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas; Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee; and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who all sit on the appropriations committee. Hagel cuts would reshape military after longest war . Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, a co-chairman of the Senate National Guard Caucus who sits on the appropriations defense subcommittee, also signed the letter. ""While we are aware that the Army's budget request for fiscal year 2015 is pre-decisional, every indication including public statements and briefings from Army leadership on Capitol Hill suggests the decision was made without meaningful consultation with the Army National Guard,"" the senators wrote. ""The shortsighted approach creates unnecessary risk to our national security at the expense of incredibly capable attack aviation assets in the Army National Guard."" The Pentagon's leaner budget proposals, unveiled Monday, include a scale-back that will whittle the nation's Army to its lowest level since before World War II and do away with the Warthogs as well as U-2 spy planes, among other cuts. Fight brewing . Those kinds of cuts are guaranteed to spark a fight pitting lawmakers against Department of Defense officials and state against state in a scramble to keep such things as aircraft carriers and their crews' economic impact on a community, said Mieke Eoyang, national security program director at the Third Way, a centrist policy organization. ""What you'll see is a fight at the lowest levels of public awareness where they'll try to restore some of those cuts,"" Eoyang said, adding that there's little political incentive for members of Congress to offer full-throated support of Hagel's proposal to trim the Army to a level of 440,000 to 450,000 troops -- the lowest level in more than 70 years. Last year, when it looked as if the A-10s were on the chopping block, Blunt, who sits on the Senate appropriations defense subcommittee, offered an amendment to the Pentagon spending measure to save the planes. Defense policy experts say that these types of military cuts usually affect surrounding communities. As troops and the civilian workers who maintain military equipment are either reassigned or move on, the towns that depend on them struggle. The Pentagon says the cuts are simply a reflection of the harsh realities of this era of federal budget cutbacks and a shift away from fighting expensive, extended land wars abroad. ""These recommendations will adapt and reshape our defense enterprise so that we can continue protecting this nation's security in an era of unprecedented uncertainty and change,"" Hagel said at his briefing. Many defense policy experts also say the cuts are practical. ""Cutting to 450,000 is significant but within reason. It is a cut of less than 10% from typical 1990s levels, or from what was recently already planned,"" said Michael O'Hanlon, a defense and foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution. ""And with Saddam (Hussein) gone in Iraq, the portfolio of threats and likely missions has shifted at least modestly away from large-scale ground combat, in my eyes."" United against the cuts . But if mounting pushback from such lawmakers as Graham and Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, among others, and a number of military advocacy groups is any indication, the Pentagon will have a hard time preserving the proposed cuts. Gov. Haley: Cuts to National Guard a 'slap in the face' South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said a White House meeting of a bipartisan group of governors Monday largely had a respectful tone until the discussion turned toward military cuts at the end. ""It automatically went into an aggressive nature by (President Obama), implying that 'many of you have asked for cuts, this is what you said you wanted ... now you're going to get it, you're going to have to live with it.' Completely different change in tone,"" said Haley, who's up for re-election this year and who made her remarks at a news conference by the Republican Governors Association after the gathering at the White House. ""It chilled the room quite a bit,"" she added. Groups like the National Guard Association, an advocacy group, are also urging their members to pressure their congressional lawmakers to reject many proposed cuts, such as trimming Army National Guard numbers and shifting Apache helicopters from the Guard to the active-duty Army. ""The National Guard is a commonsense solution to the challenges facing the U.S. military,"" said John Goheen, director of communications for the National Guard Association. ""Congress and the nation's governors see it. Unfortunately, the Pentagon does not or will not. We are disappointed, but we are hardly defeated."" Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee Rep. Michael McCaul, whose Texas district neighbors the congressional district housing Fort Hood, says he too is deeply concerned about the impact of the proposed cuts. ""This president is sacrificing our most important responsibility, our national defense, on the altar of entitlements,"" he told CNN in a prepared statement. ""Instead of taking on mandatory spending and reforming our entitlement programs, he's proposing dangerous cuts that could greatly affect our military readiness and national security. The proposed troop levels and cuts are yet another retreat by this president when it comes to the ability of our armed forces to effectively do their jobs and to the safety and security of our borders."" Kermick, the Knob Noster city administrator, said he'll leave the debates about what members of Congress should cut regarding the A-10s to those elected officials. But he knows one thing for sure: When it comes to getting rid of the A-10s, he says, ""I don't think it's a good idea, personally. But that's just my opinion.""

"(CNN) -- When authorities arrested Eric Frein near an abandoned airport hangar last week, they found a laptop, first aid supplies, shave kits, DVDs, contact lenses, and even a copy of the New Testament, according to police documents released Wednesday. Frein is charged with first-degree murder and other crimes in an ambush that killed one officer and wounded another outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove on September 12. The manhunt for Frein lasted almost seven weeks and involved as many as 1,000 officers at times. Frein's trove of survival supplies indicated that he was well-equipped to survive alone in the wilderness for weeks or even months. A police inventory listed nearly 120 items in the possession of the 31-year-old survivalist and military buff who was captured last week near Tannersville, Pennsylvania. In addition to various articles of clothing and multiple weapons and ammunition, Frein had packed food items such as cup noodles, rice, beans, five-gallon water jugs, crackers, soy sauce, vegetable oil, and even a bottle of soju, a Korean vodka. Authorities also discovered three typed pages of random prayers, a religious plaque and candles. A 14-page handwritten note was found but authorities did release further details. Frein also spent his 48 days on the lam in possession of a radio, binoculars, blankets, a headlamp, glass ashtrays, laundry detergent, batteries, maps, a nail clipper, pots and pans, a propane stove, notebooks, toilet paper, a compass, and glow sticks. Among his high-tech items were a Lenovo Thinkpad, headphones, a wireless mouse and two portable storage drives. Authorities, hoping to find out what is on the laptop, on Saturday asked a judge for permission to search the computer. Frein told authorities he used the laptop and unsecured Wi-Fi accounts during the nearly seven-week search, court documents said. A search warrant application released Wednesday described how authorities had already searched a computer from Frein's home and discovered some disturbing Internet searches that went back to November 2012. The searches included: ""how to escape a manhunt,"" ""can police track cell phone"" and ""ballistics trajectory calculator."" In the ambush outside the state police barracks, Cpl. Bryon Dickson was killed and Trooper Alex T. Douglass wounded. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Eric Frein stocked food, first aid supplies, weapons, DVDs, New Testament, police say .

"(CNN) -- Thousands remained without power Saturday in the metro Detroit area after powerful thunderstorms the previous night that left one man dead and frightened others in its path. The man was killed in the Detroit suburb of Warren after being electrocuted by a fallen power line in his backyard, according to CNN affiliate WDIV-TV. The victim did not realize the wire was down, the TV station said. DTE Energy reported 230,000 customers without electricity as of 9 p.m. Saturday, down from 385,000 at the height of the outage. Others attending church festivals around the region got a scare when high winds caused tents to collapse, WDIV reported. Larry Tomenello recalled people yelling as strong winds literally picked up a massive tent over the St. Hubert's Parish Festival in Harrison Township, prompting a frenetic push to get everyone out before 100-pound beams came crashing down. The Rev. Paul Ballien described a similar situation at his church in Dearborn Heights. ""The tent ... just collapsed over on one side,"" Ballien told WDIV. ""And I know there were people under there, and I just couldn't do anything about it."" DTE Energy said wind gusts as high as 75 mph downed more than 2,000 power lines across southeastern Michigan. More than 600 personnel from as far away as Tennessee, Wisconsin and New York worked 16-hour shifts alongside tree-trimming crews to bring back service, according to the utility. ""The vast majority of customers will have their power restored by late Monday night, but ... some small clusters of customers .... probably will not be restored until Tuesday or Wednesday,"" DTE Energy said. At least the weather cooperated in one respect Saturday in Michigan: Conditions were comfortable, with temperatures peaking in the mid-70s and relatively light winds. The same storm system that caused the extensive power outages in Michigan moved through the Northeast on Saturday. Areas from eastern Pennsylvania all the way north to Maine could see powerful winds and large hail, said CNN meteorologist Todd Borek. The National Weather Service issued severe thunderstorm watches and warnings from northern Virginia up the East Coast, including Philadelphia, New York and Boston. There's also a small chance for an isolated tornado, Borek said, but hail and damaging winds are the main threat. Hundreds dead in flooding across Asia .

"(CNN) -- When I moved to Washington almost 20 years ago, I subscribed to four daily newspapers. Printed newspapers, that is: on paper, with ink. In the mid-1990s, network news was already a fading phenomenon. But the Washington media elite booked time to watch programs such as ""Crossfire"" at the time they were broadcast. For special events, one might fire up the VCR. But the technology was inconvenient and annoying, and the tapes were awkward to store. E-mail had existed for some time, as had online discussion groups, and other innovative communications technologies. But it was still new that major media companies had ventured online: 1996 was the year that The New York Times and The Washington Post launched their websites. Longer form journalism, the kind published by magazines, still arrived in the mailbox via the U.S. Postal Service. We already had cell phones, of course. We used them to make phone calls. Offline, the past 20 years have not been a period of remarkable technology progress, not when compared with say 1894-1914 (invention of the radio, the vacuum cleaner, the safety razor, the first plastic and propelled aviation, and diffusion of the telephone, the automobile, electric light, the phonograph and motion pictures) or 1935-1955 (penicillin, radar, the first freeway, the first supermarket, the first home freezer, commercial aviation, credit cards and the birth-control pill). As compared to the mid-1990s, we haven't seen much progress in the way we get to work or travel to different countries. We heat and light our homes more or less as we did then. Treatments have radically improved for HIV/AIDS, but otherwise transformative medical breakthroughs have arrived only slowly. What did arrive, of course, was the revolution in creating and sharing digital information. In most respects, this revolution has proven a thrilling force for human emancipation. Yet nothing, no matter how beneficial, comes unattended by negative side effects. The digital revolution has played havoc with the profitability of media companies. The troubles of newspapers are notorious, but life is not a lot more comfortable for radio and television companies. The most successful business model yet discovered in this new environment is to reinvent the news organization as a news community. At a time when people are less inclined to join institutions, new kinds of media can offer a community substitute: an environment in which users can have their identities ratified and their beliefs validated. The fastest way to generate such a sense of community is to conjure up threats: health scares, crime waves, wars on Christmas. Isolated in self-selected communities, these threats won't be tested very hard against contrary realities. As every roller-coaster owner knows, people like to be scared. Unreal fears are the best of all, since nobody in the end really gets hurt. The faster today's fears evanesce, the more compulsively must the audience return tomorrow for more. Information has never been more accessible and abundant. And yet so much of that information turns out not be true. And whereas in early terms it was the least informed people who were vulnerable to the grossest inaccuracies, today it is very often the nominally best informed. How you assess economic conditions, for example, turns out be less connected to actual economic events than how you feel about the party of the president. Better education seems actually to enhance one's vulnerability to partisan distortion: A 2008 Pew study found that Republicans who had completed college were more likely to reject the scientific consensus on climate change than Republicans who had not done so. More sophisticated news consumers turn out to use this sophistication to do a better job of filtering out what they don't want to hear. This is the environment that made conservatives vulnerable to Cliven Bundy -- and that will, as surely as hucksters follow money, expose liberals to Bundy's opposite number the week after next, or maybe the week after that. The digital revolution offers the most stirring new possibilities to the human intellect since the invention of the printing press. But as Albert Einstein said after the nuclear revolution: Everything seems to have changed except our modes of thinking. *** . This will be my last column for CNN.com. I am truly grateful for the magnificent opportunity to interact with this vast audience.

"(CNN) -- Rescuers searched for survivors Sunday after a landslide in northwestern Colombia killed at least 18 people and trapped dozens of others, Red Cross officials said. Workers were manually removing rubble as rescue dogs searched for signs of life, said Cesar Uruena, national relief director for the Colombian Red Cross. ""We have to be very careful, thinking of the people that could be alive,"" he said. Heavy rains caused the landslide, which buried about 16 homes in the city of Manizales early Saturday morning, Red Cross spokesman Leandro Soto said. CNN affiliate Caracol showed images of buckled rooftops jutting out beneath a massive mound of earth. ""We cannot lose hope. We are still hoping to find more people alive,"" Soto said. Thirteen people have been rescued from the rubble, Soto said, including five whom crews pulled out Saturday night, 15 hours after the landslide. Sixteen people were being treated for injuries, Uruena said. About 100 rescuers were working in shifts at the scene, he said. Psychological support teams were also on hand to counsel victims and their families, Soto said.","NEW: Rescuers are manually removing rubble as rescue dogs search for signs of life .

"(CNN) -- The defense team for Charles Taylor, the former Liberian president accused of war crimes, formally concluded its case on Friday, the Special Court for Sierra Leone said. The defense case began in July 2009, and 21 witnesses were called in Taylor's defense, including Taylor, who faces an 11-count indictment for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Prosecutor Brenda J. Hollis on Friday welcomed the end of the evidence phase of the trial as an ""important step"" and lauded the witnesses who testified for the prosecution and defense. ""Their courage and willingness to take the stand and bear witness has been an inspiration. We in the prosecution have always said that we fight for justice in the name of the victims, but they are the ones who have truly made justice possible,"" she said. Taylor took the stand in July 2009 and ended his testimony in February. The last witness was a Liberian commander of the Revolutionary United Front. The trial is being held at Hague, Netherlands. The war crimes charges against him stem from the widespread murder, rape and mutilation that occurred during the civil war in Sierra Leone, fought largely by teenagers who were forced to kill, given addictive drugs to provoke violent behavior and were often instructed to rape and plunder. Taylor -- who was president of Liberia from 1997 to 2003 -- is charged with five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, enslavement and sexual slavery and violence. He also faces five counts of war crimes, including acts of terrorism and torture, and one count of other serious violations of international humanitarian law. He has pleaded not guilty. Ninety-one prosecution witnesses had taken the stand in Hague, and the prosecution reopened its case in August to hear testimony from three added witnesses. Closing oral arguments are set for February 8, 9 and 11, and a trial judgment is expected in mid-2011.","Defense called 21 witnesses in former president's war crimes trial .

"(CNN) -- No one imagined a thin sheet of ice could wreak this much havoc. Paralyzed by the glaze and gridlock, countless drivers in the Deep South spent the night shivering in their cars, unable to get home after more than half a day ... and counting. Here are some of their stories: . Stuck en route to a funeral . Tammy Jocelyn was on a journey she didn't want to have to make -- she was en route to a funeral when her Greyhound bus stopped cold on an Atlanta interstate Tuesday night. As of twelve hours later, Jocelyn and other passengers were still stuck on the bus. ""I really hope I make it up there in time,"" the Jacksonville, Florida, woman told CNN Wednesday morning. ""This isn't something I've ever experienced."" She's not sure where she is, just that she was on I-75 heading north when traffic stopped moving at 10 p.m. ""There are hundreds, maybe thousands of motorists with me,"" Jocelyn said. ""You look out the window and see people in the middle of the interstate sleeping in their cars."" The mood on the bus is calm, despite there being no food or water on board, she said. Jocelyn still has a long way to go; her final destination is Chicago. ""The weather is clear. That's the worst part about it. The sun will melt the snow before anyone comes to save us."" Children stuck in schools, on buses . Desperation and kindness . In the 12 hours that Ashley McCants contended with the ice and traffic, her SUV careened into a ditch twice. It took her five hours to pick up her son from school. They spent another seven hours in the car, trying to get to their Atlanta home several miles away. The day dragged into night. Finally, the sight of a nine-car wreck sent her over the edge. ""At that very moment, I thought, you know what, I need help -- I can't do this anymore. I need to get home."" So she vented her frustration on Facebook, and friends directed her to the page SnowedOutAtlanta. Within hours of the storm, more than 25,000 people joined the Facebook group to connect the stranded with those who might be able to provide shelter or supplies. ""I actually had a very nice, sweet family that took my son and I in,"" McCants said. But to get to that home, she had to carry her 5-year-old son about 2 miles across the snow and ice. ""My big takeaway is don't give up. I sat in this traffic for 12 hours. It was all about faith and believing,"" McCants said. ""There are good people all over the city no matter what. There were so many people willing to help me and my son, and I feel so blessed to be taken in by this family, even though it was a brutal day."" Thousands stranded for hours . Awake for 27 hours . In his almost 20 years of being a truck driver, Greg Shrader has never been in a pickle quite like this. He had been stuck on Interstate 20 west of Atlanta for 23 hours and counting, as of noon Wednesday. The trucker from Maine said he had given up on getting to Alabama, where he was supposed to pick up a load of cars from a Mercedes plant. All he wanted was somewhere safe to pull over and take a nap -- he had been up for 27 hours straight. ""You don't want to go to sleep in the truck because if traffic moves, you're part of the problem,"" Shrader said. When he heard CNN's interview with Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed on the radio, he said he ""almost lost my mind."" The mayor blamed the city's gridlock on decisions by schools and businesses to send people home at the same time. ""I've hauled cars for 18 years, 48 states and Canada. I have never been failed by officials like I have here,"" he said. ""Still no equipment, no well-being check. No plan. I guess we're waiting for it to melt."" At least for now Shrader has snacks. He has been snacking on Planter's peanuts he happened to have in his cab, he said. Was Atlanta asleep at the wheel? Sleeping outside Taco Bell . Mariano Castillo left work Tuesday afternoon. By midnight, he gave up and called it a night outside a Taco Bell. ""Nine hours in traffic and barely halfway home from the office,"" said Castillo, an editor at CNN. ""Some stretches of highway looked like a vehicle graveyard, abandoned cars and stranded big rigs at irregular intervals."" During those hours, he witnessed acts of selflessness. ""I saw good Samaritans who helped ladies get up after a fall or push cars whose tires squealed with effort to grip the road. Others, I could tell, would not bend a finger to aid anyone if it meant giving up an inch of road. ""At one particularly gridlocked stretch, folks were able to leave their cars and walk to a CVS for supplies. You definitely were in the 'in' crowd tonight if you held your plastic CVS bag and its treasures like a designer handbag. ... Even I found myself looking hungrily at those with the plastic bags."" Then getting home was no longer a priority. Getting food was. ""I have given up my stubborn plan to make it home and have a cup of hot cocoa no matter the time,"" he said. ""I found a 24-hour Taco Bell, spent my last $5 on a quesadilla and am closing my eyes in my trusty RAV4. I wonder what I will awake to."" Missing family members . Ana Maria Martinez said some of her relatives were still missing Wednesday morning. ""We haven't heard from our cousin and her two daughters since yesterday at 7. ... Their cell phones died,"" Martinez said. ""They're in a dark blue Audi A6. ... The girls are 5 and 14. ... We would love to hear from someone who may have seen them to make sure they are OK."" Tonya Derr Buchter can relate to the agony. ""(Thirteen) hours and still no word on my son,"" she said on Facebook. ""Hang in there everyone (it's) been tough."" Pregnant and stranded . ""(Nine) months pregnant on Thornton Road and Factory Shoals. Haven't eaten since 10 a.m. yesterday. Can't move my car due to the ice,"" Regina E. Coley wrote Wednesday morning on SnowedOutAtlanta. ""I tried calling for an ambulance but there's a major accident and they can't get down to me. (M)y car is out of gas and I'm starting to get cold, dehydrated and hungry. Please help!!"" Cathi Milanes was one of the many Atlantans who offered up her home. ""I live right on the corner of two major highways, so I figured I was in a convenient location,"" Milanes said. ""I had an extra room and a bed, so it was a no-brainer to help."" By midnight, no one had taken up her offer -- in part because some couldn't reach her home. One man got in an accident during the storm and injured his knee, Milanes said. ""His sister posted (about) him -- he was literally walking distance from my place,"" Milanes said. But because of his injury, ""he couldn't walk to me if he tried."" Fortunately, she said, another good Samaritan picked up the injured man and took him home.

"Oak Creek, Wisconsin (CNN) -- The FBI will investigate Sunday's rampage at a Sikh temple in a Milwaukee suburb as a ""domestic terrorist-type incident"" that left at least six people and the gunman dead, the town's police chief said. Another three people were wounded, including the first officer to respond to the scene, Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said. A second officer returned fire, killing the suspect, according to the chief. All three wounded -- one of whom was shot in the abdomen and chest, another in the extremities and face and the third in the neck -- were in critical condition Sunday night at Milwaukee's Froedtert Hospital, the hospital said in a statement. Terror, tragedy for tight-knit Sikh community . The congregation's president was among the wounded, his nephew said. And another man told the CNN affiliate WTMJ, ""Nobody's angry here. We're just confused. Was this a random act? Was this directed at us because of the way we look?"" Authorities have not identified the gunman by name, though Thomas Ahern, a spokesman with the ATF's Chicago division, described him as a white male roughly 40 years of age. No connection has been established between the shooter and the temple, he added. Like other officials, Ahern said authorities have not determined a motive, adding ""we are a long way away from that right now."" Teresa Carlson, special agent in charge at the FBI's Milwaukee division, said late Sunday that investigators are still assessing whether this ""might be an act of domestic terrorism, no motive has been determined at this time."" The Sikh religion originated in northern India around 1500 and has about 25 million followers, 700,000 of them in the United States, according to the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund. Sikhs tout equality, service to others . Because of their customary beards and turbans, Sikh men are often confused for Hindus or Muslims -- and have been the targets of hate crimes since the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, said Surinder Singh, a spokesman for the Guru Nanak Mission Society of Atlanta. Several Sikh leaders and members recalled Sunday the killing of a Sikh man in Arizona in apparent retaliation for the attacks that had been carried out days earlier by the Islamic terrorist group al Qaeda, as well as other less severe crimes targeting the group over the past decade. Community continue to blend in and stand out . ""There's always an apprehension and a sense of fear that this kind of incident will take place anywhere, anytime,"" said Rajwant Singh, chairman of the Sikh Council on Religion and Education. Sunday's attack occurred about 10:30 a.m. (11:30 a.m. ET), when temple members were reading scriptures and cooking food in preparation for the main Sunday service and community lunch, said Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka, a member of the congregation and the nephew of its president. Kaleka was not at the temple at the time of the shooting, but helped police interview witnesses in the aftermath. He said members described the attacker as a bald, white man, dressed in a white T-shirt and black pants and with a 9/11 tattoo on one arm -- which ""implies to me that there's some level of hate crime there."" A law enforcement official briefed on the investigation confirmed the shooter was wearing a white T-shirt and did not have a bulletproof vest. Kaleka said the gunman started shooting in the parking lot, ""then entered into the temple and proceeded to open fire."" ""It seems the few casualties that have been divulged to me have been the equivalent of priests, the holy leaders of our people,"" he said. ""My uncle is one of the administrators of the temple. It's mainly those individuals who have been targeted or shot. Maybe it's because the ladies were fortunate enough to dodge it out, but so far most of the people I've heard have been shot and killed were all turbaned males."" Police searched the suspect's home, ""a short distance"" from the temple, on Sunday evening, according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation. A single 9mm semi-automatic pistol believed to have been used by the gunman was found at the scene, along with the wounded officer's weapon, the source said. Initial reports were that there may have been multiple attackers, but police found no indication of another gunman, said Bradley Wentlandt, the police chief in nearby Greenfield. The Oak Creek temple, or gurdwara, opened in 2007 and has a congregation of more than 350. Family members gathered outside told WTMJ that survivors were being taken to a nearby bowling alley so they could be interviewed by police. ""Our dear ones and near ones are injured and hurt, and we are trying to find out what happened,"" said Darshan Dhaliwal, a congregation leader. Congregation president Satwant Kaleka was shot and wounded when he attempted to tackle the gunman, his son, Amardeep Kaleka told WTMJ. His mother -- who hid in a closet during the violence -- was too distraught to talk, he said. State Rep. Josh Zepnick said many members of the Milwaukee area's Sikh community are among his constituents and described himself as being ""torn to shreds"" by the attack. ""It's a very peace-loving community that has successfully integrated and assimilated into the metropolitan Milwaukee area,"" Zepnick told WTMJ. And state Rep. Mark Honadel, whose district includes the temple, called the attack ""craziness."" ""Unfortunately, when this type of stuff hits your area, you say to yourself, 'Why?' But in today's society, I don't think there's any place that's free from idiots,"" Honadel said. The American branch of the World Sikh Council, meanwhile, said Sunday was ""a troubling day, not only for Sikh-Americans, but also for all Americans."" Sikhs in U.S. and India react to the rampage . ""We urge all to pray for the victims, their families and friends, and the surrounding community,"" the group said. ""We also express our gratitude towards the law enforcement authorities for their prompt and effective response to the situation as it unfolded."" National and state political leaders -- including Gov. Scott Walker -- also offered condolence after the killings, which came two weeks after a massacre at a Colorado movie theater that left 12 dead and dozens more wounded. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney called the slaying ""a senseless act of violence and a tragedy that should never befall any house of worship."" And from the White House, President Barack Obama said the United States had been ""enriched"" by Sikhs, ""who are a part of our broader American family."" ""My administration will provide whatever support is necessary to the officials who are responding to this tragic shooting and moving forward with an investigation,"" Obama said. Rajwant Singh, from the Sikh Council on Religion and Education, put the onus on politicians, the media, academics and non-profit leaders to educate Americans about diverse groups and act ""to lessen this kind of rage."" He called it a tragedy Sikhs, growing up in the United States feel as if they don't belong in this country after incidents such as this. ""Everybody should feel at home,"" he said. ""This nation belongs to everyone.""

"New York (CNN) -- Two men suspected of planning an attack on a Manhattan synagogue with guns and a grenade were arrested Wednesday, marking the end of a seven-month undercover operation by New York police officers. The suspects, Ahmed Ferhani and Mohamed Mamdouh, were detained in midtown Manhattan after buying two loaded Browning semi-automatic pistols, one Smith & Wesson revolver, ammunition and a grenade, according to Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. At least a dozen police officers swarmed Ferhani, who was at the time placing the weapons in the trunk of his car. Mamdouh was arrested on a street nearby moments later. Each faces terrorism and hate-crime-related charges and, if convicted, could confront the prospect of life behind bars without the possibility of parole. Ferhani, a 26-year-old unemployed resident of Queens, is a native of Algeria who traveled to the United States in 1995, claiming asylum. ""Muslims are abused all over the world, and I ain't going to take it,"" prosecutors quoted Ferhani as saying; his conversations with an undercover police officer were secretly recorded. Prosecutors say Ferhani sold narcotics in an effort to finance the planned attacks. His defense attorney, Stephen Pokart, told Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Melissa Jackson that his client ""hasn't committed any crime at all."" Mamdouh, 20, also a Queens resident, was previously arrested on a pending 2010 burglary charge. He worked for a local delivery service and came to the United States in 1999 with his family from Casablanca, Morocco. Defense attorney Steven Fusfelda -- while not acknowledging the legitimacy of the charges -- asked for leniency given that the prosecutors' case appeared to hinge more directly on Ferhani, he said. Both men's voices were captured on audio recordings plotting the attacks, District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said, but they had not selected which synagogue to target. Neither man has been charged in connection with a terrorist cell. Both, however, were allegedly ""committed to violent jihad,"" telling police that they wanted to kill Jewish people and also hoped to attack New York's Empire State Building, Vance said. ""While Osama bin Laden is dead, terrorism around the world is not,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Thursday. Such ""lone wolves"" are ""the toughest to stop,"" the mayor said, noting that 12 other terrorist plots in New York have been thwarted since September 11, 2001. ""We know that, as an international symbol of freedom and liberty, New York City is and will always be a target."" Authorities said the suspects discussed disguising themselves as Jewish temple-goers, growing their beards and pretending to pray as a way to sneak inside a synagogue and place a bomb. During the course of the police investigation, Ferhani was recorded discussing his goal of financing ""the Palestinian cause in Gaza"" and traveling to Gaza in an effort to kill Israeli soldiers, according to a district attorney statement. The suspects offered no resistance during the arrest, and the plot appears to be more aspirational than operational, police said. They were arraigned Thursday in Manhattan Criminal Court. ""Generally the federal government has a greater interest in prosecuting these matters,"" said former federal prosecutor Michael Wildes. ""Their deferral here begs the question of the posturing and the behind-the-scenes politics that played out."" Wildes called it a ""major accomplishment"" for the state to try a terrorist suspect, rather than to proceed under federal jurisdiction. Over the course of the investigation, prosecutors say, Ferhani discussed buying multiple guns while trying to learn how to build a bomb. He allegedly proposed blowing up an empty synagogue, as well as a church in Queens. Later, Ferhani was recorded discussing ideas of blowing up a synagogue ""with Jews or Zionists inside,"" the statement said. ""The defendants plotted and took concrete steps to bomb synagogues and kill Jewish New Yorkers as an act of terrorism,"" Vance said. Meanwhile, U.S. Homeland Security officials continue to stress that lone wolves and homegrown terrorists are high on their list of concerns and can be just as dangerous as those with direct ties to al Qaeda or other extremist groups. The terror threat ""was on the radar screen"" well before al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed May 2 in Pakistan, one law enforcement source said. The arrests grew out of another investigation that also began long before bin Laden's death, officials said. Jewish Federations of North America President and CEO Jerry Silverman released a statement Thursday saying his group was ""disturbed by the news reports of a homegrown terror plot aimed at Jewish communal institutions in New York City."" In the wake of bin Laden's death, he says, the federation is endeavoring to help ""communities be prepared, alert and secure against the heightened threat.""

"(CNN) -- If democracy had existed in ancient Egypt, then not a single pyramid would have been built. All because free people in democratic countries will only agree to build pyramids for good wages, and good wages are incompatible with a luxurious lifestyle of the Pharaohnic family. But if the country has no Pharaoh then it will not cross anybody's mind to build pyramids. If ""Ukrainian democracy"" had existed in ancient Egypt then the pyramids would not have been built, not only because of a lack of money for salaries but also because of the ordinary theft of half of the funds allocated for their construction. I'm not actually a big proponent of building pyramids. But ""Ukrainian democracy"", I like it. What is more, it feeds me. Not in the sense that it provides some kind of social security and promises a good retirement. No! With enviable regularity ""Ukrainian democracy"" feeds me with plots for novels, as well as offering so many potential fictional heroes that no one writer could fit it all in even if he writes two thick novels in a year. Therefore because of a lack of enough lifetime to write hundreds of novels, I have to write some of the real-life stories just like this, in short articles. The presidency of Viktor Yanukovych started in 2010 with a slogan: ""We are building a new country"". Billboards with the slogan decorated all the country's cities, villages and roads. So, everyone understands that major construction work is starting, which means that smaller signs of the kind that adorn building sites will soon appear, reading: ""Sorry for the inconvenience."" Anyway the construction boom first started in the capital, Kiev. On the hills overlooking the Dnieper River work began on a presidential helipad and overpass leading to the government quarter in the city. At the same time work began on a helipad near the mountain at the summit of which is buried national Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko, a hundred kilometers from Kiev. They said that from now on for the effective use of time of the head of state the president will only go and see the grave of the great poet by helicopter. The helipads having not been completed the country set about building stadiums for Euro 2012 to be held in just a month, new airport terminals in the cities where matches will take place and, of course, set about the repair of the roads on which hundreds of thousands of fans from Western Europe will doubtless travel on when they come to Ukraine. Stadiums seem to have been built and officials from UEFA were very pleased, roads are still under construction but the helipads they just can't manage to sort out. It would be a pity if fans arrive in Kiev or elsewhere in their helicopters and they have nowhere to land. Of course international VIPs might arrive by helicopter to Kiev, Donetsk and Lviv to support their national teams. Yet there is currently a big question mark over the arrival of presidents and prime ministers. They first call for Viktor Yanukovych, or to be exact, the state of Ukraine, to release Yulia Tymoshenko. First for treatment and then completely. But in a normal country the president cannot simply release a person from prison! Wasn't it the judge who put her there and not the president? There was an investigation, there was a trial. The court sentenced her to seven years in prison, but the investigation continues and will soon add one or two other sentences to her first making her a permanent resident of Kachanovskaya female penal colony. Therefore it would make more sense for the heads of state and presidents to send their request directly to the judge Rodion Kireev who announced the verdict, and not to president Yanukovych who does not deal directly with such matters as there are more important things in the state than Tymoshenko. For example the literary process. But more about that a bit later. The paradox of the current political situation is the fact that Yulia Tymoshenko is getting in the way of Viktor Yanukovych from ""building a new country"". He hoped that while in detention she would not bother him, but as it turned out, while in prison she disturbs him and the building of a new country even more. Hundreds of government officials from former Soviet states and other foreign countries require and request a meeting with her, distracting the ""builders of a new country"" -- a large and active clan of businessmen representing the eastern regions of Ukraine. And for some reason no one wants to meet Viktor Yanukovych! He organized a summit for heads of state of central and eastern Europe in Yalta and presidents simply refused to come to it in a sign of protest. However it is not all bad. A few days ago the president of Moldova finally arrived to visit President Yanukovych. The Ukrainian president pleased with the respect shown to him by the president of the neighboring country relaxed and talked, which seldom happens to him. He said to the Moldovan president, but loud enough so the whole world heard, that for both Ukraine and Europe it would be useful to take a break from their relationship and to forget about each other for a while. Clearly Europe is tired of Ukraine but president Yanukovych has made it clear that Ukraine is sick of Europe, too. Moreover, neither Russia nor the United States are behaving in a humane way and also call for the release of the above mentioned Yulia Tymoshenko as if she was a common victim of judicial abuse. Vladimir Putin has somehow also forgotten that a criminal case was opened against her in Russia ten years ago and several Russian defense ministry officials were sent to prison involved in the fraud of United Energy Systems of Ukraine, which at that time was overseen by Yulia Tymoshenko. Looking for Ukrainian politicians and officials who have never broken the law is a tedious and thankless task. Among political analysts there is an idea that if you want to put people in jail then you should imprison not just political rivals but all those guilty of something. However, the Minister of Internal Affairs recently announced that among all the people arrested for corruption the majority are members of the ruling party - the Party of Regions - and not the opposition. He immediately added that this is completely logical, as the Party of Regions is the largest in Ukraine and almost all government officials are members of it. Don't think that I am defending someone or standing up for Yulia Timoshenko or Angela Merkel who was also criticized by the Party of Regions for her public statements. I just think that if the Party of Regions would spend five year putting in prison all the corrupt members of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc, and then, cleansed from corruption, Yulia Tymoshenko would come to power and spend five years imprisoning those corrupt members of the Party of Regions, the situation would clearly improve and the parties themselves would be reduced to a human scale. This would be a big positive. Yes, the country is looking forward to Euro 2012, but this political ""football"" without rules has been going on in Ukraine for two years already and during this time the two major political parties have simply trampled the ""football field"", which is Ukraine itself. At the moment it's a one-sided game and it's clear that the ruling party is winning. Meanwhile the president has somehow hidden from public view behind the very high and well-protected fence of his country residence. Near to it a new building with an office for the president was constructed. Strange, but when completed this new building immediately became the property of some Cypriot off-shore company that the government now pays monthly rent to. It means he will only visit his official office in Kiev when absolutely necessary. For example when presidents of western countries come to their senses and stop their boycott of him. Until that moment he may remain alone in his ""Cypriot"" forest - land of the former state residence ""Mezhygorye"" that as it turned out now, too, belongs to the Cypriot off-shore company. He is secluding himself, I think, to sit down at a large, multi-volume novel. Indeed in a tax return this year he wrote that he had received an advance of $2 million for not-yet-written literary work. However he did not received this money from a publisher but an unknown printer in his hometown of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. So what lies ahead is a lot of work. The authors of real best-sellers in Ukraine get no more than $4,000 to $5,000 per book. So count how many best-sellers he will have to write. At least one of these books should be devoted to a woman. That is, to Yulia Tymoshenko. But first there is the question of genre. The novel will probably start as a drama and end up as a black comedy. By the way, ten years ago one of Yulia Tymoshenko's political aides contacted me and asked me to write a novel about her with the title ""Kill Yulia"". For money of course. The plot, a conspiracy against Yulia Tymoshenko. I refused. But soon three novels were released in Ukraine with a similar plot and one of the books was called ""Kill Yulia"". She wanted to become a literary heroine and she has become one. She wanted and still wants to be the president of Ukraine. In her life, Yulia Tymoshenko has always achieved what she wanted. By any means. And if Viktor Yanukovych loses his grip on power and doesn't pass it to his heir she will pick it up and then the ""black comedy"" will continue and become both ""horror"" and ""action"". The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrey Kurkov .","Abundance of plots for novels from Ukrainian politics, says author Andrey Kurkov .
In-fighting between major political parties has trampled Ukraine .
Despite being in prison Yulia Tymoshenko still dominates foreign relations with Ukraine ."
"(CNN) -- I remember fragments of the story of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau's killing in 2010 -- something about a ponytail, something about her slipping and falling, something about how this almost never ever happens because in these parks, the animals are happy and the trainers are safe. But something wasn't right. I remember asking someone why an orca -- a highly intelligent animal -- would attack its trainer or essentially ""bite the hand that feeds it."" We sometimes hear of dogs mauling other people, but in these cases we don't seem to hear about them attacking their masters. So why would America's lovable Shamu turn against us? How could our entire collective childhood memories of this delightful water park be so morbidly wrong? I came in with these questions. I set out to understand this incident, not as an animal activist -- because I'm not one -- but as a mother who had just taken her kids to SeaWorld, and of course as a documentary filmmaker who unfortunately can't let sleeping dogs lie. SeaWorld answers questions about 'Blackfish' I brought Manny Oteyza aboard as the film's producer, and he soon became my right arm. I spoke to Tim Zimmermann who wrote a phenomenal article for Outside magazine about killer whales and asked him to come aboard as an associate producer. I wrote a treatment. We were then funded by investors who had never made a film before. Together we set out to tell this story of an incident at SeaWorld. I knew immediately that I wanted SeaWorld to have a voice in the film. We e-mailed back and forth for about six months. I gave them every chance to talk, but they eventually declined. At that point, however, I had already began peeling back the onion. And my journey of shock and discovery was well underway. I have made television documentaries for 15 years, but ""Blackfish"" is my second feature documentary and my first one to have found theatrical distribution. I can't say this was an easy film to make. There were nightmares, too many autopsy reports, sobbing interviewees and unhappy animals. And I was scared. SeaWorld is a $2 billion a year entity, and they'll do anything to protect their greatest asset: Shamu. But as I moved forward I knew that in telling this story in an honest and fact-driven way, I was telling the truth. It sounds clichÃ© but it's really that simple. At some point you're simply compelled, in spite of yourself, to tell a story that needs to be told no matter how scared you are of an entity that could squash you. Opinion: 'Blackfish' ignores SeaWorld's benefits to conservation, research . Two years after I wrote the treatment in 2010 we finished ""Blackfish."" I can say that my crew and I are all profoundly changed by the experience. I know that killer whales are not suitable for captivity. I am dedicated to spreading the word. The early deaths, the grieving, the boredom, the daily fighting and the attacks -- what we learned over two years is impossible to shake. Once you see it, you can't unsee it. My hope is that we take the ""Blackfish"" momentum and use it to help evolve us out of animals for entertainment. These silly marine park tricks are of no social, educational or conservational value. We advocate, instead, for captive killer whales to be retired into sea sanctuaries where they can live out the rest of their lives in a dignified, sustainable manner. Share your reaction to the film . We can't throw them back into the ocean because they don't know how to hunt, their teeth are broken from years of stress and biting on metal gates, and they're hopped up on antibiotics and might die in the open ocean. However, in a sea sanctuary, where a large ocean cove is cordoned off with a net, we could monitor their health, even feed them if need be. It is the best alternative. People always wonder whether I believe SeaWorld should be closed down. I always say no. They have tremendous financial resources and could play a key role in creating sea sanctuaries which could be a profit-making endeavor. I believe people would flock to a site where a killer whale is being a killer whale for the first time -- something infinitely more satisfying than seeing a killer whale dance the Macarena. I hope you like the film. I don't know if it will change the way you feel about animals in entertainment parks. I didn't intend for it to do so. I just wanted to tell the real story. And I trust that once audiences are armed with the truth, they will make the best decisions by themselves and their families.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Police in the Maldives arrested the Indian Ocean nation's former president Mohamed Nasheed on Monday after he didn't show up for a trial over accusations against him of abuse of power. His arrest is the latest twist in the political turmoil this year that has shaken the Maldives, a popular tourist destination consisting of hundreds of coral islands south of India. Read more: The Maldives - Trouble in paradise . The authorities took Nasheed into custody at around 9:45 a.m. local time while he was campaigning on a remote island of the archipelago for upcoming presidential elections, according to police and the former president's Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP). ""We believe Nasheed's arrest is politically motivated, aimed solely at preventing him from campaigning ahead of the presidential elections,"" Ahmed Naseem, who served as foreign minister under Nasheed, said in a statement on the party's website. Nasheed, the predominantly Muslim nation's first democratically elected president, resigned in February amid a police revolt prompted by his arrest of a top criminal court judge.

But his successor and former vice president, Mohammed Waheed Hassan, insists the transfer of power was legitimate. The Maldives Police Service say the trial at the Hulhumale Court relates to Nasheed's arrest of Criminal Court Chief Judge Abdulla Mohamed earlier this year. The court issued the arrest warrant Sunday to ensure Nasheed attends the next hearing of the case, police said. Read more: Maldives' deposed president faces arrest as wife flees to Sri Lanka . Nasheed said last week that he hadn't received a court summons requiring him to attend the next hearing. He said he had written to the court to request that the hearing be rescheduled until after his planned return to the capital, Male, on Oct. 13. But the authorities were unwilling to wait and arrested Nasheed on the southern island of Fares-Maathoda on Monday. Photos made available by the MDP showed him surrounded by more than a dozen police officers wearing helmets and body armor. Naseem, the former foreign minister, accused the police of using ""disproportionate force"" to arrest Nasheed. ""They landed on this tiny island dressed in full SWAT gear and carrying weapons,"" he said. ""They behaved aggressively, and sometimes violently, towards Nasheed's supporters."" Read more: Former Maldives president beaten, his party says . Nasheed and the MDP have questioned the legitimacy of the trial, saying that judges in the Maldives had been upset by the party's campaign for judicial reform. ""It is impossible for any MDP Member, let alone President Nasheed to get a fair trial here,"" Hamid Abdul Ghafoor, a party spokesman, said last month. Nasheed is already familiar with the Maldives' courts and prisons. Prior to becoming president, he was arrested as a journalist several times and held as a political prisoner.

He was a fierce critic of the former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled the Maldives for 30 years before Nasheed defeated him in elections in 2008. Nasheed accused Gayoom of running the country with an iron fist, crushing dissent, amassing wealth and stacking his administration with friends and relatives. But Gayoom is still considered a hero by many in Maldives who credit him for transforming a fishing culture into a tourist nation.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is considered a rising GOP star and the Republican Party's leader on fiscal and budgetary issues. The chairman of the House Budget Committee was first elected to Congress at age 28, and later helped launch the party's ""Young Guns"" program to recruit candidates in districts where Republicans lost. Now 42, Ryan is the architect of the House GOP's budget proposal, which Democrats compared to an attack on the poor, but Republicans say is intended to save Medicare and rein in spending. The chairman of the House Budget Committee was announced as the running mate for presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney. ""It's [Romney's] decision months from now, not mine. So why spend my time thinking about it? If this bridge ever comes that I should cross it, then I'll think about it then. It's not the time to think about it,"" he told The Wall Street Journal in April. Romney announces Ryan as running mate . A native of Janesville, Wisconsin, Ryan earned a degree in political science and economics from Miami University in Ohio in 1992. He was raised as a Catholic, and worked at a family construction company before getting into politics. He's known to be an avid hunter and a fitness fanatic. In the House, Ryan is also a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee. He has frequently pushed the Republicans' ""class warfare"" line against President Barack Obama and is a major critic of his signature health reform law. ""If you give us more elected representatives to fix this problem, we will fix this problem in 2013,"" Ryan said in an interview with CNBC. Because he hails from Wisconsin, an important battleground, Ryan's youthfulness could appeal to a group with whom the president enjoys advantages. Ryan is considered a lightning rod, and his presence on the GOP ticket will fundamentally change the 2012 race. Where does Romney stand on the Ryan plan? ""It would be a bold choice,"" CNN senior analyst David Gergen said earlier of a Romney-Ryan ticket. ""It would be a risky choice."" But there are upsides. Ryan will likely energize a GOP base often suspicious of Romney, and add youthful vigor to the race with his energetic debates and campaign methods. Close friends such as former House colleague Mark Green are adamant Ryan would help across the Midwest. Ryan's college years . ""I think he does get Wisconsin,"" Green said. ""But I think more importantly he gets that sort of blue-collar conservatism that I think is at the heart of the Republican Party."" For months, Romney has tried to frame the race as a referendum on the first Obama term, specifically the president's economic record. Adding Ryan to the ticket would mean no escaping an onslaught of Democratic criticism that the Republican ticket would ""end Medicare as we know it"" as Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is fond of saying. Paul Ryan, by the numbers . One ad, by nonprofit political organization Agenda Project, critical of the Ryan budget showed a man pushing an elderly woman in a wheelchair off a cliff, and ended with the tagline: ""Is America beautiful without Medicare? Ask Paul Ryan and his friends in Congress."" Ryan calls the attacks demagoguery and says Obama has failed to put forward serious proposals to reform costly entitlement programs. This is the ""bold"" debate conservatives pushing Ryan want, but other Republicans worry it could steer the campaign focus away from the president and onto GOP proposals. Other potential downsides include Ryan is a House member popular in what was once considered a competitive swing district, but he has never run statewide. He also has no foreign policy experience. Interactive timeline . In light of the Sarah Palin 2008 pick, some will question whether the House member is ready to be commander-in-chief. ""He is without question one of the stars of the Republican future over the next 10 to 20 years,"" Gergen said. ""Whether he is ready at this moment, only the campaign trail could tell. And he's going to get, I'll tell you, he is going to take a real beating."" Ryan is also a policy wonk, a self-described nerd who cut his teeth working for conservatives Bill Bennett and Jack Kemp. Friends say it would be a mistake to underestimate his ambition, or his competitive streak. How do you feel about Romney picking Ryan as his running mate? Let us know on CNN iReport.

"(CNN) -- Rosie Napravnik made history by becoming the first female jockey to win the $2 million Breeders' Cup Distaff Friday -- then she dropped the real bombshell by revealing she was seven weeks pregnant and would retire after racing again on Saturday. The 26-year-old guided the three-year-old fillie, Untapable, to a one and a quarter length victory over its closest rival at the prestigious event in Arcadia, California. She then took to the podium to reveal the baby news in front of her stunned mother, who she had still to inform of her pregnancy at this point, and a live television audience. ""Wasn't planning to announce until after I finish riding tomorrow but winning the BC Distaff on Untapable was just too special,"" Napravnik later tweeted. ""Looking forward to 4 live mounts tomorrow (Saturday) and making my retirement even more special by going out with a bang,"" she later added. A two time winner of the Kentucky Oaks and the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in 2012, Napravnik is married to Joe Sharp who is a racehorse trainer himself. She is currently the sixth highest earning jockey on the North American circuit, winning more than $13 million of prize money in 2014 alone. In the past she has spoken about the challenges female jockeys face compared to their male counterparts. ""For a female jockey it's a little bit harder to get yourself established. But once you can get over that hump and prove that you're a competitive rider, and win races, it's irrelevant what gender you are,"" she told CNN in 2013. ""To be honest, the female aspect has worked to my advantage in a lot of respects -- just with publicity and being recognized for things that I've accomplished which may not have been such a big deal if it was just another male jockey."" But perhaps the racing world shouldn't be too surprised Napravik has decided to chose motherhood over the saddle. She revealed in the run-up to last year's Kentucky Derby that she planned to start a family before long. ""There's still a lot of things that I want to accomplish in my career so I'm going to try and get all of that out of the way first -- my husband and I are very excited about having a family,"" she said at the time. That said, there can be hardly anyone who expected the announcement so abruptly after a historic triumph.","Rosie Napravnik announces she is pregnant after winning Breeders' Cup Distaff .

"Anand, India (CNN) -- Madhu Makwan asks a reporter to translate a card in English she received from a Canadian family for whom the Indian laborer spent nine months gestating their son for them. The letter reads in part: ""Without your help and sacrifice, we would not be able to have our family. Please know we will tell him about you and how special you are to us. We will never forget you, you will always be in our hearts."" Makwan delivered the boy two weeks ago. ""Of course I feel bad -- I kept the child in my womb for nine months,"" she said. ""But she needs a child; I need money."" Surrogacy in India is booming, thanks to the low cost of the procedure, availability of surrogates in the world's second most populous country and the fact that India is one of the few countries in the world that allows commercial surrogacy. In one hostel in Anand -- a small city known as the ""milk capital"" of India in the far western state of Gujarat -- there are 50 surrogate mothers living together, each who will earn around U.S.$8,000 for carrying a baby. ""It's a lot of money,"" said a woman who identifies herself as Manjula. ""For people like us who have never seen money, it's a lot of money."" This is the second time Manjula -- a 30-year-old who has a son and two daughters of her own -- has carried a child for profit. Before surrogacy, she and her husband used to earn less than $2 a day working in the fields. ""The first time I came, I made a house,"" she said. ""Now I have come for my daughter. I have to educate her, I have to get her married."" ""I want to teach my daughters computers; I have to educate them -- get (them) married to a nice boy,"" she added. The number of skilled doctors has made India a global Mecca for couples seeking someone to carry their baby for them. At this hostel, all the women are under the care of Dr. Nayana Patel. She began caring for surrogates in 2003, when she helped a grandmother who was carrying twins for her daughter. ""That's when I started commercial surrogacy because not everyone is lucky to have a mother or a sister or a friend to carry their child,"" she said. ""The surrogate is getting the life that she dreamed of, because otherwise she could not get this kind of money or change the life for her husband, her children, get a house, educated her children,"" said Patel, who has delivered close to 700 babies from surrogates for 580 couples since 2004. ""And the couple could never have had a child if the surrogate had not helped them. So -- the ultimate result is a baby has come into this earth, which is beautiful."" India has now taken steps to regulate the industry. It's banned foreign same-sex couples and single parents from hiring surrogates. A new proposal would require mothers be aged between 21 and 35. Patel has had ""lots of inquiries from same sex couples but we have never done it. Not for any other reason, this being a small town, people are not aware of all this and for the surrogate to be introduced to same sex couple would be too much, I felt."" Critics call India's surrogacy clinics baby-making factories. ""Commercialization has led to a lot of financial exploitation of these women,"" said Ranjana Kumari, a women's rights activist and director of the Center for Social Research in New Delhi. Although surrogates interviewed by CNN in Anand say they get as much as U.S. $8,000, Kumari said research by the center shows that promised cash from surrogacy clinics often fall short -- sometimes being paid as little as U.S.$800. ""So its not really a profitable business as is presented,"" Kumari said. ""If someone really has to opt for the child, somebody's friend should offer a womb, somebody's relative should offer the womb. Why it has to be the poor woman? It's like organ sale,"" Kumari added.

"Henryville, Indiana (CNN) -- Big news in Henryville, Indiana, had been that the coach of the high school boys' basketball team was stepping down at the end of the season. The Hornets are the pride of this small Indiana town a few miles up Interstate 65 from Louisville. That was before Friday when killer storms ripped through the area. One day there was a community here. The next, there was none. ""What we know is we've got complete destruction. We're going to deal with it the best we can,"" Sgt. Jerry Goodin of the Indiana State Police told CNN affiliate WISH-TV. Goodin was sure the community would rally, come together and claw its way back to what it once knew to be normal. Saturday, as rescuers still scoured for survivors, the stunned people of Henryville mourned what they lost and gave thanks for what they still had. Steve Kloepfer lives in Chelsea, just east of Henryville. Friday, he watched on television as the storms drew near. ""I saw it from the radar it was getting close, so I walked down the driveway and saw it coming through the woods,"" Kloepfer told CNN affiliate WHAS. He got in his truck and drove south about a mile to ""let it blow through."" He returned to a new, grim reality. A tornado destroyed his house and the the home shared by his aunt and uncle, Terry and Carol Jackson. They were missing along with their 4-year-old grandchild. Later, their bodies were discovered in a field, covered in debris. They were among the 14 who died in Indiana. Dozens killed in waves of storms . About 2,000 people live in Henryville, known as the birthplace of Colonel Harland Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken fame. Many in this town know each other through the high school and elementary school, housed on one campus. Friday afternoon, not all the students were able to leave because their parents were not at home. Elementary School Principal Glenn Riggs huddled with 40 students in the offices. And prayed. Saturday morning, a girder jutted skyward from the wreckage of the school. Across the street, a yellow school bus that only hours ago had taken children home lay off its chassis, slammed into a building as though it were a toy tossed by a child. Considering the damage, people at the school should have been hurt, Riggs figured. ""It's a blessing. We praise God,"" he said. Aerial images of Henryville Saturday were devastating: the guts spilled out from buildings, debris littering open fields and trees felled like dominoes. Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels got up in the sky to survey the misery himself. Lucky it wasn't worse, he thought. ""We're not unfamiliar with Mother Nature's wrath out here in Indiana,"" he said. ""But this about as serious as we've seen it in the years I've been in this job."" Joe Sullivan, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said the tornado that swept through the area was an EF-4 -- meaning it had sustained winds of between 166 and 200 mph, putting it in the top 2% of all tornadoes in terms of strength. It went for 52 miles and was roughly 150 yards wide, he added. People driving on Indiana Highway 60 Friday got a perfect view of the monster twister barreling through town. Lawrence Smith, a reporter with WDRB, saw the tornado hurtling straight toward him. The video his station was able to get was incredible, he said. So was the experience. Smith ran into a convenience store for cover as the funnel drew closer. ""We waited for it. The building shook, the lights went off. The noise was incredible,"" he said. ""It passed right by in front of us."" A gas station across street was leveled, as was a nearby apartment complex. Chad Hinton captured the tornado from his truck as he drove home to nearby Borden. He had never quite seen anything like it. Adrenaline pulsed through his veins. ""It was a huge powerful force,"" he said, recalling the thundering noise. The hail and rain bore down on his truck. He felt lucky to be what he estimated as two miles off the twister's track. He thought about the people who were right in the middle of it. In Salem, another town near Henryville, a little girl with blond hair and blue eyes was found alone in a field. No one knew how she had gotten there; they just knew she needed help. The 20-month-old toddler was taken to hospital and intubated to help her breathe, said Clark County Sheriff's Department Maj. Chuck Adams said. She was later flown about 35 miles southeast to Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, where she was in critical condition Saturday night, said Brian Rublein, a spokesman for Kosair. Someone had called to identify the girl, and by Saturday night several extended family members were on hand. But her immediate family -- her parents, 3-year-old brother and 2-month-old sister -- were all killed in the storm, according to Rublein. As uncertain as the toddler's fate was, she was a glimmer of good news amid the sorrow. Another child, a 9-year-old boy from Henryville, is missing. Adams said that the boy's whereabouts have been unknown since twisters hit. With power out, authorities relied on thermal radar imaging and search-and-rescue dogs to try to find him. Others waited for loved ones at Henryville's St. Francis Xavier Church, which became a meeting point for frantic residents looking for loved ones. The message on the church's answering machine summed up the community's fears: . ""Hello, this is Father Steve. I'm sorry to let you know we do not have any detailed information ourselves on people. They are consolidating information at the fire station. However, there is no way of contacting the fire department through normal channels because the phone lines are down. All I can say is pray for your friends and family.""

"(CNN) -- Residents in Mayflower, Arkansas, have filed a class-action lawsuit against ExxonMobil after a pipeline rupture that allowed thousands of barrels of heavy crude oil to flow into a residential area.

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton was the fastest racer in the West as he won the United States Grand Prix to add fuel to his world title chances. Flags and banners bearing his name waved under sunny skies at the circuit outside the Texan city of Austin -- and he did not disappoint the grandstands. Hamilton daringly dived up the inside of Nico Rosberg on lap 24 to snatch the lead from his Mercedes teammate. ""Nico wasn't defending really and I almost caught him unaware, Hamilton later said of the maneuver. ""There wasn't a moment in the race when I didn't think I could get him."" The victory was Hamilton's 10th of the season and moved him 24 points clear of his fierce title rival with two races left to go. But even if Hamilton wins next week's Brazilian Grand Prix just ahead of Rosberg, there is still a chance the 2008 champion will be denied a second title. A new ruling for 2014 will see double points awarded at the last race in Abu Dhabi -- which means a win is worth 50 points instead of 25. There were swirling suggestions in Austin that Mercedes are privately worried that a final twist of fate in this fierce title race lies ahead in the desert denouement. Perhaps unsurprisingly though, Rosberg spoke favorably of the rule change. ""For me it's great to hear because there's a definite shot at the championship,"" he said. Elsewhere, Daniel Ricciardo -- the only driver other than the Mercedes duo to take the checkered flag this season -- finished third for Red Bull after another battling race in Austin. ""It wasn't boring out there,"" the Australian said. ""We had good pace, we were strong. I'm really happy with the third -- I think it was the best we could do today. But despite Ricciardo's excitement just 18 cars -- instead of the full complement of 22 -- lined up here on the Texan grid. The Caterham and Marussia teams were forced to miss the race because of financial difficulties and have also dropped out of next week's Brazilian Grand Prix. Caterham racer Marcus Ericsson chose to attend the U.S. Grand Prix anyway but he told CNN, ""I was out racing with these guys a couple of weeks ago in Russia and now I'm not racing. ""It's disappointing and strange."" For others at the heart of Formula One, the race weekend was also clouded with concern over the sport's financial future. Bernie Ecclestone, the sport's commercial rights holder, took the unusual step of holding a media conference at the Circuit of the Americas. ""We have to decide the best way to sort this whole thing out,"" said Ecclestone, who had earlier hinted the grid could shrink to 14 cars next season because of the growing costs of running an F1 team. ""Frankly, I know what's wrong but don't know how to fix it. No one is prepared to do anything about it because they can't."" Ecclestone was referring to the complex commercial agreement the teams have signed that binds them until 2020. The sport's governing body, the FIA, issued a statement saying it was ""in favor of any initiative that will help reduce costs in order to ensure the survival of the existing grid."" While there may be two races left to settle the 2014 world title and double points on offer come the finale, for the teams lower down the grid it may be a case of double or quits when it comes to their finances.","Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes wins U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas .

"(CNN) -- A South Korean navy ship sank in the Yellow Sea near North Korea late Friday, and the navy shot at an unidentified ship toward the north, according to reports quoting South Korean government officials. Yon-hap News Agency quoted Navy officials saying Friday that a ship carrying 104 crew members sank off the Seoul-controlled island of Baengnyeong in a flashpoint maritime border area between the Koreas. The 1,500-ton Cheonan went down at 9:45 p.m. near the island, but the cause of the incident was not immediately known, the officials said. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak ordered a ""quick and thorough"" investigation Saturday into what caused the ship to sink, keeping in mind ""all possibilities,"" his office said, according to Yonhap. A rescue operation was under way, with the Navy telling Yonhap it had rescued 58 crew members but it feared others may be dead. The South Korean government issued a statement saying the reason for the incident remains unclear, but it wasn't ruling out some sort of military engagement. An explosion had occurred in the rear of the ship, leaving a large hole in the ship's underwater hull, officials told Yonhap. A U.S. State Department spokesman said Friday that there was no evidence North Korea was behind the incident. ""Let's not jump to conclusions here,"" said the spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, when asked about possible North Korean involvement. ""I'm not aware of any evidence to that effect, but I think the authoritative source here would be the South Korean government."" Yonhap quoted South Korean naval officials as saying a South Korean vessel fired at a ship toward the north later. However, South Korean government officials said it isn't certain whether North Korea was involved in the incident. Yonhap said local residents reported hearing gunfire for about 10 minutes. As a result of the incident, South Korean government officials held an emergency meeting of ministers handling security-related matters, officials told Yonhap. South Korea's Korean Broadcasting System said Navy vessels and helicopters were rescuing crew members, some of whom reportedly jumped into the sea after the blast, the KBS report said. The official said the Sockcho, another South Korean navy vessel patrolling nearby, fired at unidentified ships north of the area. U.S. military officials told CNN a South Korean vessel sank. North Korea has said recently it is bulking up its defenses in response to recent joint South Korean-U.S. military drills, Yonhap reported. The news agency also quoted South Korean military officials saying North Korea conducted dozens of artillery firing drills Friday.","NEW: South Korean president orders ""quick and thorough"" investigation .

"(Oprah.com) -- If certain gym side effects (sweaty-hair sideburns, sock cankles) are bringing you down, here's how to deal. Post-swim under-eye creases . Cause: Suction, which helps keep out water, can also cause goggle frames to sink deep into the delicate tissue under the eyes, accentuating puffiness and dark circles, says Monica Scheel, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in Kona, Hawaii (home of the Ironman Triathlon World Championships). Solution: While there's no such thing as a crease-free pair of goggles (especially if you have noticeably deep tear troughs), your best bet is to find a pair that doesn't sit directly under the eyes, says Scheel, who not only treats triathletes but is also an Ironwoman champion. Either go small, with the race series by View or the Speedo Jr. Hydrospex goggles (kids' frames tend to cover less of the eye area), or find a wider mask that hits lower on the face. The swimwear company Aqua Sphere is owned by the diving outfitter Aqua Lung, and the scuba influence can be seen in the broader design of its Kayenne goggles and, especially, in the Vista Lady swim mask, which has a soft silicone facial ""skirt"" that doesn't dig into the skin. The company says Olympic swimmer Amanda Beard trains and races in the Kayenne and wears the Vista during open-water fun swims. Sweaty-hair sideburns . Cause: Short, layered pieces of hair escape your ponytail, slap against your face and stay there until the end of your workout. This is not only annoying, but can also lead to breakouts, Scheel says, especially if those wayward strands are coated in hairspray, gel or other styling products. Solution: While nylon, cotton, jersey, polyester and Spandex headbands may stick to thick, textured hair, they can slide off a sweaty head of fine hair. A tighter band won't necessarily help, but something with a little traction will. Goody's new Slide-Proof head wraps have a zigzag of silicone gel on the underside to keep the band - and your hair - in place. Goody says that in company tests, their head wraps offer 42 percent more hold than wraps made from fabric, jersey or plastic. Boob bounce . Cause: Researchers at the University of Portsmouth in England have found that during high-impact activities like running, breasts move not just up and down, but also in a repetitive figure-8 pattern that is barely controlled by most standard sports bras. It sounds perverse, feels miserable and leads to chafing, discomfort, weakened breast tissue and even an unstable stride, found the researchers. Solution: The sports bra company Shock Absorber commissioned a portion of the breast-health research from the University of Portsmouth. Its Run bra top encapsulates and lifts the breasts in soft, molded cups that control vertical and lateral sway, has seam-free inner elastics to reduce chafing, and stays put thanks to wide straps. When running on a treadmill, a typical sports bra might reduce bounce by about half; tests show that the Shock Absorber reduces it by 78 percent. Panache, a U.K. lingerie company, was inspired by the University of Portsmouth research to do its own tests. Last October, Panache released a sports bra that reduces bounce by 83 percent. Workout wedgies . Cause: During a vigorous workout, ill-fitting bottoms that are too big or too small often migrate to...somewhere in the middle. Solution: First, make sure that your bottoms provide ample coverage and have four-way stretch so that they move when you do. You've probably discovered that cotton, which can feel so loose and liberating when you put it on, tends to bunch and sag when it becomes wet with sweat - so instead, look for breathable wicking material like Coolmax or DriFIT. Patagonia's Active Hipster briefs are form-fitting without being form-squeezing and have chafe-free leg openings that won't creep up. And the Asics ASX bikini brief has a smooth, supportive fit that prevents cheek creep with a knit weave that feels soft against the skin. Sock cankles . Cause: When bulky athletic socks hit above the narrowest part of the ankle, they shorten the legâ€”not a good look in shorts, and even worse in capris. Solution: Your instinct is probably to buy superlow tab socks, but these often slip into sneakers, especially if you're wearing cushioned running, aerobics or trail shoes. This can lead to blisters and lots of cursing. Wrightsock Low Quarters are the Goldilocks of athletic socks: They hit very low on the leg but have a supportive ankle band to keep them from slipping under your foot (they were designed for competitive runners who don't have time to adjust their socks during a race). These Wrightsocks are made from a wicking polyester blend and have a double-layer design to prevent excess rubbing, which makes them ultracomfortable for running and flattering for all types of exercise.

"(CNN) -- How free are you to say what you think and what you believe? How free are you to hear the views of others, of those who challenge widely held beliefs or dare to criticize the powerful? Upon the answer to that question lies the essence and the soul of democracy. That's why today we have more conclusive evidence that democracy is faltering in Russia and why we see alarming signs that the revolution in Egypt may lead not toward, but away from, the democratic path. It's also why we have reason to feel encouraged about the prospects for change in Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) and why we know that, despite populist claims, democracy in places such as Iran, Venezuela and Ecuador -- the country that offered asylum to WikiLeaks' Julian Assange -- is either dead, dying or suffering a serious illness. And it's why we know that China has not a shred of democratic rule. When Russian authorities decided to throw the book at three punk-rock performers from the provocatively named group Pussy Riot, the issue was always democracy or, rather, lack of it. Prosecutors charged the three -- Maria Alyokhina, Yekaterina Samutsevich and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova -- with hooliganism and religious incitement after they staged their iconoclastic show earlier this year in Moscow. The three burst onto the altar of the city's Cathedral of Christ Our Savior, wearing their trademark face covers and brightly colored balaclavas, and spent 40 seconds chanting their song ""Mother of God, Cast Putin Out,"" which later became part of their YouTube hit ""Punk Prayer."" The performance was meant to shock. But, more than anything, it was an act of protest. Like others in Russia, they were taking on the increasingly authoritative rule of President Vladimir Putin. And, in this case, they wanted to draw attention, they said, to the church's growing role in politics. Normally, the disruptive show would have received a fine, charges of disturbing the peace or disrupting a religious service. But in today's Russia, you cannot take on the president without serious consequences. The women of Pussy Riot gained notoriety partly for the name of their group and their colorful antics. But their case is only the most highly publicized of a number of terrible abuses of the law against critics of the president. Alexei Navalny, one of the most popular of Putin's detractors, has been charged with embezzlement on what many people believe are trumped up charges. Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky remains in a Siberian prison, where he has been since 2005 after daring to challenge Putin's authority. Countless Russian journalists have died mysterious deaths, as have anti-corruption crusaders, such as Sergei Magnitsky. Opposition leader Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion, has come under physical attack . Attacking the opposition, imprisoning one's critics is one way to tighten one's hold on power. But there is no better way to maintain the perception of democracy than by controlling what the people -- the voters -- are allowed to hear and read and think. That's why restricting freedom of expression, especially media freedoms, is the favorite sport of authoritarian governments that want to preserve the appearance of democratic legitimacy. Winning an election could confer democratic legitimacy. But what happens when the opposition doesn't have access to the media? What happens when journalists are not free to criticize the government? That's when democracy dies, even if it lives in a zombie state, with leaders elected by voters with access only to views in support of the regime or where the president's critics are smeared, ridiculed and maligned, as happens in far too many places. In Egypt, which has its first elected president, there is evidence of a move to stifle criticism and bring a single point of view to the public. When the newspaper Al-Dustour ran a list of accusations against the Muslim Brotherhood, from whose ranks President Mohamed Morsy rose, authorities removed every issue from the stands. The paper's editor, Islam Afifi, is one of several journalists charged with insulting the president. Afifi says the Brotherhood wants to ""silence any opposition to their policies."" The Upper House, dominated by Islamist legislators, just hand-picked 50 newspaper editors for state-owned publications. Morsy named a Brotherhood activist, Salah Abdel Maksoud, as information minister, adding to fears among many journalists that Islamists will gain control of the media. In Ecuador, the country whose democratically elected president has embraced WikiLeak's Assange, a self-described champion of freedom of expression, journalists say President Rafael Correa has launched a campaign of fear and intimidation to stifle criticism. Ecuador's mind-boggling media law prohibits reports and even editorials that ""have a bearing, in favor of or against a specific candidate, proposal, option, electoral preference or political thesis."" The Committee to Protect Journalists calls it ""coerced pre-emption"" and says it adds to a program of smear campaigns and defamation laws aimed at producing self-censorship. Self-censorship, of course, is the ultimate desired result. When the government doesn't have to imprison or harass its critics anymore because no one dares criticize it, then democracy is only skin deep, no matter how free elections appear. Then, few dare to criticize the government, and voters are exposed to glowing reviews of their leader's prowess and wisdom. It's easy to win elections that way. Ecuador is following the model put in place by Venezuela, where President Hugo Chavez imposed the Law on Social Responsibility in Radio and Television, complete with multimillion dollar fines and shutting down of outlets that run afoul of the government. To keep a patina of democratic freedom, some opposition is allowed to function, but the playing field is sharply tilted. Those tactics are much more subtle than Iran's, where the government has thrown scores of journalists in prison. The regime has not only imprisoned and tortured journalists, it has also shut down newspapers, blocked websites and jammed satellite signals. The government now says it plans to stop using the Internet by 2013 because it is ""untrustworthy."" Sadly, restrictions on freedom of expression, one of the most fundamental of all human rights, are much more widespread than most people realize. According to Freedom House, a human rights advocacy group, only 14.5% of the world's people live in places with true media freedom. The encouraging news in all of this is that the efforts of authoritarian regimes to silence their critics highlight the power of words, the power of free expression and the importance even they place on having democratic legitimacy. That remains a powerful incentive for advocates of democracy to keep up their fight. If they lose the battle to pry open the flow of ideas, they will lose the struggle for democracy, because even when a president is elected, if the people are not free to criticize him and his policies, then democracy is a mirage -- and so is freedom.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- America's first female four-star general has been nominated, the Pentagon announced Monday. Lt. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody was nominated to be America's first four-star female general. President Bush nominated Lt. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody to serve as head of the Army's supply arm. By law women are excluded from combat jobs, the typical path to four-star rank in the military. ""This is an historic occasion for the Department of Defense and I am proud to nominate Lt. Gen. Ann Dunwoody for a fourth star,"" said Defense Secretary Robert Gates. ""Her 33 years of service, highlighted by extraordinary leadership and devotion to duty, make her exceptionally qualified for this senior position."" The Senate must approve the nomination. Dunwoody, a native of New York, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1975 after her graduation from the State University of New York in Cortland. She also holds graduate degrees in national resource strategy and logistics management. She became the Army's top-ranking woman in 2005 when she received her third star and became deputy chief of staff for Army logistics. ""I am very honored but also very humbled today with this announcement,"" said Dunwoody. ""I grew up in a family that didn't know what glass ceilings were. This nomination only reaffirms what I have known to be true about the military throughout my career ... that the doors continue to open for men and women in uniform."" The Army Materiel Command handles all material readiness for the Army. During her career, Dunwoody has been assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, 10th Mountain Division and the Defense Logistics Agency. She served with the 82nd Airborne in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. She has been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, Master Parachutist Badge and the Army Staff Identification Badge. The first woman to become a general officer in the U.S. armed services was Brig. Gen. Anna Mae Hays, chief of the Army Nurse Corps, who achieved the rank in 1970 and retired the following year. Elizabeth Hoisington, the director of the Women's Army Corps, was promoted to brigadier general immediately after Hays. She also retired the following year. Maj. Gen. Jeanne M. Holm, the first director of Women in the Air Force, was the first woman to wear two stars, attaining the rank in 1973 and retiring two years later. In 1996, Marine Lt. Gen. Carol A. Mutter became the first woman to wear three stars. Mutter retired in 1999. Currently, there are 57 active-duty women serving as generals or admirals, five of whom are lieutenant generals or vice admirals, the Navy's three-star rank, according to the Pentagon.","Bush nominated Lt.

"(CNN) -- He's football's chief sinner, and Luis Suarez's alleged attempt to bite Giorgio Chiellini's shoulder in a key World Cup game has prompted an outpouring of indignation from the game's global congregation. While many sought to condemn a man who is embroiled in the third biting controversy of his career, some observers felt compassion for the under-fire star. ""I actually feel sympathy for him,"" said Dan Abrahams, football psychology expert and author of ""Soccer Brain."" ""He's one of the world's best players and he obviously has a problem,"" he told CNN. ""That problem comes up at the wrong time, in the wrong place and he has to learn how to manage it, but that's tough to do."" Suarez has incisor history on the football pitch. When playing with Dutch club Ajax in 2007 he was suspended for seven games for biting an opponent, while he was hit with a 10-match sanction for an identical offense while playing for Liverpool in April 2013. His short fuse, according to Abrahams, is part of a negative response to frustration which he has likely been dealing with for most of his life. This is a player who at the age of 16 was given a red card for headbutting a referee. ""It's an instinctive response to frustration,"" explained Abrahams. ""Rationally, it's something that you would think that he could manage and deal with, but that's not how we work as human beings. It's something that he has to deal with and manage for the rest of his playing days."" One criticism of Suarez is that his past indiscretions suggest he might be irredeemably unreformable. His misdemeanor in Natal the latest in a long line of unsavory incidents which includes serving an eight-match ban for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra in 2011. But Abrahams insists it's too simplistic to say Suarez is a millionaire sports star who should know better. Have your say on Luis Suarez! CNN's Facebook Pulse . ""That's not the way we as human beings or the brain works,"" argues Abrahams, who points to the fact that many people have certain behavioral habits they would rather not broadcast to the public. ""The fact that he's high profile means absolutely nothing. It's like saying that somebody who is rich should never get depressed, it's like saying somebody who is famous should never lose their rag. ""That's ridiculous. Fame doesn't inoculate your brain from life's stresses and strains. ""We're all subject to road rage, for instance, and that's essentially what it is. It's a form of road rage."" The key to cracking Liverpool striker Suarez's tendency to bite opposition players could lie on the training field -- a place where Abrahams believes the Uruguayan could benefit from some tough love . ""I think the solution is actually quite simple,"" he said. ""At his home club, whether that remains Liverpool, if it's (Liverpool manager) Brendan Rodgers and his coaching staff, what you need to do is help Luis Suarez experience frustration and experience a different reaction and response. ""A practical working example could be playing a small-sided game with Rodgers engineering a situation where Suarez would get frustrated. ""For example putting two or three Liverpool players on him and probably being overly aggressive, fouling him and making sure that when Suarez goes to react, he reacts with a different response. ""Put him under that stress and strain in every training session. Make him react and respond and then change his response from maladaptive to adaptive, so you aren't biting somebody, you're just carrying on with the game."" Whether Suarez will be able to carry on at this World Cup is a matter of debate. Uruguay's win on Tuesday earned it a place in the second round and a tie with Colombia, but football's global governing body FIFA has opened disciplinary proceedings over the biting incident which could end Suarez's involvement in the tournament. Abrahams agrees that Suarez should be punished, but his overriding observation is that empathy should be shown to someone who is battling a deeply-ingrained problem. ""I just think it's an enormous challenge for him to help himself,"" he said. ""I know how tough change can be and how tough managing yourself can be. ""I would imagine that 99.9% of the population are absolutely s**t at managing their mindset on a day-to-day basis. ""The fact is that sport is offered up to the media's glare. The world is watching you, I actually feel sympathy for him.""","Luis Suarez was seen to apparently bite opponent in key World Cup game .

"(CNN) -- One tornado stayed on the ground for 95 miles as it tore through towns in Kentucky and West Virginia. Two other twisters left behind 49-mile paths of destruction. The dynamically charged nature of Friday's atmosphere created an ideal environment for producing long-track, devastating tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. Officials from the weather service identified at least 45 separate tornadoes in last week's deadly outbreak across the Midwest and South. The unusually severe storm system affected millions of people in 10 states, officials said. Neighborhoods were flattened. Schools were in ruins. Dozens died. Cleanup begins after tornado outbreaks . The strongest tornado appears to be the one that hit Henryville, Indiana, with maximum winds at 175 mph. That tornado stayed on the ground for 49 miles across Washington, Scott, Clark and Jefferson counties in Indiana and Trimble County in Kentucky. The twister rated EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, which weather service officials use to measure the intensity of tornadoes and the damage they are likely to cause.

The twister left normally tranquil West Liberty looking like ""a war zone,"" Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear told reporters Sunday. National Guard troops helped the town comb through debris while authorities investigated storm fatalities. ""In all the years I've been coroner, I've never seen bodies in the condition they're in,"" said Raymond Van Cleave, the coroner for Morgan County, Kentucky. Just 20 miles south of West Liberty, another long-track EF-3 tornado swept through Salyersville, Kentucky, packing 160 mph winds. That twister was also on the ground for 49 miles, with a 48-mile track through Kentucky and an additional mile into West Virginia, officials said. It struck a group of rescuers who were heading to West Liberty, throwing their truck across the street. ""It kept peppering us with debris and rocks and dirt and stuff. It was just something unreal.

The 45 twisters confirmed by the weather service were among 144 reports of tornadoes, which may include multiple reports of the same tornado, in last week's outbreak, which started Friday. By the time calm returned Saturday, 41 were dead: 23 in Kentucky, 13 in Indiana, three in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Georgia. Federal and local officials were still assessing the damage Wednesday. Less than 1% of the tornadoes that form each year reach EF-4 or EF-5 intensity, and few are on the ground for more than a few miles. The tornado with the longest recorded path in U.S. history was the Tri-State Tornado of 1925, which was rated an F-5 on the Fujita scale -- the previous model for tornado intensity -- and was on the ground for 219 miles over a 3Â½-hour period. That twister still stands as the single deadliest tornado, responsible for 695 deaths when it tore through Missouri, Illinois and Indiana. The Joplin, Missouri, tornado on May 22, 2011, was the deadliest tornado the United States has seen in the last 60 years, with 161 dead.

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans' chances of winning control of the Senate in Tuesday's midterm elections are now up to 95%, according to CNN's Pivit, an analysis that combines experts' projections with political watchers' predictions on key races. The jump was driven largely by a Des Moines Register poll over the weekend that put Republican Joni Ernst 7 percentage points ahead of Democrat Bruce Braley in a Senate race seen as a must-win for Democrats. In that race, Pivit puts Ernst's chances at 88%. Pivit also offers bad news for Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado, whose chances are at just 6%, and Sen. Mark Pryor in Arkansas, who's down to 2%. Pivit's analysis suggests Democrats are in better shape in North Carolina, where Sen. Kay Hagan has a 69% chance of holding off Republican challenger Thom Tillis, and in New Hampshire, where Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's chances of beating Scott Brown are up to 81%. Republicans, meanwhile, look to have put Kentucky's Senate race out of reach. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell's chances of surviving a challenge from Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes are up to 97%. Republicans need a net gain of six seats to capture a majority. Pick-ups in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia are all but assured, and Democratic incumbents are facing uphill battles in Alaska, Arkansas and Louisiana, as well. Republicans are also hoping for wins in states like Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire and North Carolina -- which would help solidify their chances of gaining a majority by providing insulation in case the GOP loses seats of its own in Georgia and Kansas.","After rosy polls, CNN's Pivit puts Republicans' chances of winning a Senate majority at 95% .

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton opened the door to a presidential bid a little wider over the weekend at the Harkin Steak Fry in Iowa. And now veterans from her 2008 campaign and Iowans urging her to run in 2016 are calling for her to use the state's first-in-the-nation caucus to slam the door shut on the Democratic nomination. Their message is simple: If you win in Iowa, you will be the nominee. If you let someone hang around -- or win -- you could cost yourself the nomination. Hillary Clinton returns to Iowa: A fresh start or deja vu? ""I think that Secretary Clinton can close the door in Iowa. It is going to take a lot of work, but it is out there to be done,"" said Jerry Crawford, Midwest co-chairman for Clinton's 2008 campaign. ""I think if she wins ... it would be very difficult, very unlikely that anybody could mount a challenge after Iowa."" Crawford, who also ran Bill Clinton's 1992 and 1996 presidential campaigns in Iowa, said he has expressed this sentiment to Hillary Clinton's closest advisers and aides. There is a level of bluntness in those who advocate for Clinton to run hard in Iowa, and it stems largely from her history in the state. Some of it is self-serving. The more active Clinton is in Iowa, the more other candidates will be forced to campaign in the state. That means money for Iowa's economy -- some economists estimate that more than $51 million was spent in Iowa in 2008 around the caucuses. And it raises Iowa politicos' profiles. The other reason has more to do with Clinton's record in Iowa. Most Clinton supporters in the state feel that the nomination was hers to lose in 2008 and don't want the same thing to happen in 2016. During Clinton's failed 2008 bid, the former first lady finished a dismal third in Iowa. She blundered several times in the state, none more stinging than when a memo written by then-Deputy Campaign Manager Mike Henry about skipping Iowa was leaked to The New York Times. ""I propose skipping the Iowa caucuses and dedicating more of Senator Clinton's time and financial resources"" to other primary states, Henry wrote. The plan was considered and then rejected. CNN reached out to Henry for a comment, but the now-chief of staff to Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, was not available. The fallout was swift and added fuel to the fire that Clinton was running a detached campaign in Iowa. She began to cool down in the state just as then-Sens. Barack Obama and John Edwards (who would go on to finish second) got hot. Clinton has called the defeat ""excruciating."" She went into Iowa in 2008 with a shrinking lead over Obama and Edwards. She is better positioned now, with 53% of all registered Democrats contacted in Iowa saying they would support her if the 2016 caucuses were held today, according to a recent CNN/ORC poll. That number is triple the nearest potential Democratic candidate. Others have landed in Iowa . While she played coy in the beginning, for the last few months Clinton has regularly admitted the worst-kept secret in the United States: She is thinking about running for president. She has company. Vice President Joe Biden is in Iowa on Wednesday to speak to a group of nuns on the steps of the Iowa Capitol. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont held three events in Iowa over the weekend. And Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley has visited the state three times this year and has 11 staff members on the ground. Bernie Sanders calls for ""political revolution"" in Iowa . They and others have said they are thinking about running in 2016. A call for competitive primaries . Not all longtime Clinton organizers are convinced that slamming the door in Iowa is the best strategy to be ready for the general election. Bonnie Campbell, a longtime Iowa politician and Clinton's campaign co-chairwoman in 2008, thinks that competitive primaries will ""make her stronger, both politically ... and as a candidate."" ""If Hillary can come here and compete with other candidates and put it away, I am all for that,"" said Campbell, who also chaired the Iowa Democratic Party from 1987 to 1991. ""But I think it is important to recognize that it is healthy, it is a healthy thing, to have different points of view offered and discuss and it also usually happens."" Some Clinton supporters in Iowa have also been cautiously watching some of those other candidates, impressed with their operations and commitment to the Hawkeye State. Though they all said Clinton would win if she ran, there is a clear concern that someone could organize effectively and get hot at the right time -- like Obama did in 2008. But even Scott Brennan, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, who remains neutral in nomination fights, sees an Iowa win as a way Clinton could lock down the nomination early. ""It seems to me that it is reasonable to think that way,"" he said at an interview in Des Moines. ""Why give somebody that opportunity to get that national presence if in fact she is serious about running?"" Brennan, who was party chairman during the caucuses in 2008, said that while Clinton finished third, it wasn't because she didn't have a lot of support from state Democrats. Instead, he said, it was because she ran into Obama's force-of-nature campaign.","Iowa Democrats have stressed to Clinton aides how important the state will be .

"(CNN) -- Federal jurors convicted the son of former Liberian president Charles Taylor Sr. of torture and conspiracy charges Thursday, said a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in the southern district of Florida. Charles ""Chuckie"" Taylor Jr., also known as Charles McArthur Emmanuel, was found guilty on one count of torture, one count of conspiracy to commit torture and one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, said Alicia Valle, special counsel to the U.S. attorney. Taylor's case, tried in Miami, Florida,  was the first brought under a 1994 United States law saying those accused of committing torturous acts overseas can be tried in a U.S. federal court. ""Today's conviction provides a measure of justice to those who were victimized by the reprehensible acts of Charles Taylor Jr. and his associates,"" Attorney General Michael Mukasey said in a written statement. ""It sends a powerful message to human rights violators around the world that, when we can, we will hold them fully accountable for their crimes."" He could face a sentence of life in prison when he is sentenced January 8. Although Taylor was born in Boston, Massachusetts, he moved to Liberia when his father was named president. Prosecutors said Taylor became the leader of the Anti-Terrorist Unit and the Liberian National Police while his father was president. The two groups are accused of abducting, torturing and killing people. According to prosecutors, Taylor committed torture and allowed others to commit torture. They burned certain victims with molten plastic, lighted cigarettes, candle wax and an iron; severely beat victims with firearms and cut and stabbed victims; and shocked certain victims with an electric device, prosecutors said in an indictment that superceded the initial indictment from 2006. In the initial indictment, Taylor was charged with one count of torture, one count of conspiracy to torture and one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. The superceding September 2007 indictment -- which incorporated the initial charges -- included five counts of torture, one count of conspiracy to torture, one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime and one count of conspiracy to use a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. The defense had said the U.S. government had little or no evidence to back up its claims. Charles Taylor Sr. is standing trial in The Hague, Netherlands, on war crimes charges. He was sentenced to 11 months in prison but was ordered detained on the torture charges and not released when that sentence expired, the U.S. attorney's office said.","Charles ""Chuckie"" Taylor Jr. is also known as Charles McArthur Emmanuel .

"(CNN) -- She called him her little Ewok. Six-year-old London had severe autism, according to an archived blog that his mother, Jillian McCabe, appears to have written in 2011 and 2012. She chronicled what it felt like to realize something was wrong when he was a baby. He wasn't reacting when he heard his name. He didn't show affection or interact. He was missing milestones. When the diagnosis came, she and her husband, Matt -- according to their own social media writings -- devoted their lives to their son. Then came another enormous blow: Matt developed multiple sclerosis. ""I'm trying to hold it together,"" Jillian said in a YouTube video that was posted on her Facebook page but has since been taken down. ""It's really hard. I'm losing it a lot."" On Monday evening, the 34-year-old mother walked onto the Yaquina Bay Bridge in Oregon carrying her son, police say, and threw him into the frigid water. ""I just threw my son over the Yaquina Bay Bridge,"" Jillian McCabe told a 911 dispatcher, according to a probable cause affidavit. His name is London, she said, and then she began describing her boy in detail, including the clothing he was wearing, according to the document. She gave his date of birth, her name and date of birth. She described herself. At the end of the call, she said there was a police officer standing with her on the bridge. According to the affidavit, several officers said they heard her saying she'd thrown her son off the bridge. On Tuesday, McCabe appeared via video conference in Lincoln County court. She was charged with murder and manslaughter and did not enter a plea. Her next hearing is next Wednesday. A judge set her bail at $1 million. CNN has left phone and email messages with her attorneys and has not received a response. A troubled mother? In the YouTube video, Jillian McCabe said she thought about pulling a ""Thelma and Louise,"" referring to the movie about two women who drive off a cliff to escape their problems. Her brother-in-law Andrew McCabe told NBC News that she had been ""hearing voices"" and was supposed to see a doctor to adjust her medication on Tuesday, the day after London died. NBC also reported that relatives said McCabe endured mental illness for two years and buckled under the weight of caring for her son and her husband. ""We learned just yesterday that Monday morning Jillian expressed to her counselor that she was hearing voices again,"" Andrew McCabe told NBC. ""The counselor suggested that her medication needed adjusting and set an appointment with a doctor for the next day."" He said that Jillian McCabe sought but did not get services that she needed, and she tried to kill herself numerous times. CNN cannot independently confirm what the family has told NBC. Andy McCabe, London's uncle, told CNN affiliate KPTV that the family is stunned and deeply saddened, but not angry at Jillian McCabe, because she was sick and didn't get the help she needed. Learn more about autism . 'Mr. Doom & Mrs. Doom' In her archived blog, posts describe what it was like to raise London. One post praises a teacher and therapists who helped the boy in 2012 make strides like washing his hands and drinking out of a cup without a lid. An October 25, 2011, post called ""Mr. Doom & Mrs. Doom"" reads: ""Mr. Doom and I are parents of a nonverbal child with severe Autism who has seizures. We live, breathe and see a world that is different than yours. The word 'Autism' is sure to be a powerful repellant to any of your party guests; all of our conversations will surely be awkward ones and will include things like sensory tools, therapy sessions and weighted blankets."" Another post says: ""I think the parents of Autistic children often stick together: Matt and I isolate ourselves a lot and stick together. We can't really explain accurately to others our experiences. I think the worst thing that Matt and I are going through as parents is the comparison to other children in our family and in our lives. We can't help but to compare London and all it does is tear us up inside, but it is like something we cannot control."" ""Family gatherings are hard,"" she wrote. ""It is sad when the other children are running and playing together or when they are being held and engaged by other adults; London just sits alone in his own world. Christmas is particularly heart breaking because he doesn't understand that you need to open a present to find a treasure inside, nor does he understand the treasure. It's hard to watch other children rip open their presents excitedly while London sits near his still wrapped gift. ""We feel awkward because London is acting awkward and everyone else in the room senses the awkwardness. We in turn feel bad for creating a scene or ruining someone else's time. Even worse, we feel broken because London isn't even aware that it is Christmas. We can only wonder if he will ever appreciate a present or how many years will pass before he does."" 'Vigorous' prosecution . London's killing has sparked strong emotions, particularly from parents of disabled children and those who have autism. Many want the focus to remain on London, not his mother. Some are tweeting at #justiceforlondon. ""His name was London McCabe and he deserved better than to be murdered by (being) thrown off a bridge,"" Sharon McDaid tweeted. ""Killing your child is not a breakdown, it's murder, many parents have breakdowns & never resort to murder,"" Kimberly Faith posted. A nonprofit national group whose members have autism, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, urged ""vigorous prosecution"" in McCabe's case, according to a statement. ""London, and not his mother, is the victim of a terrible crime,"" the statement read. President Ari Ne'eman told CNN that all too often the killing of children with disabilities is blamed on stress that caregivers are experiencing. Media and others should be careful, he said, about framing disabled children as a burden. Doing that can inspire copycat killings, Ne'eman said, noting that the organization has several members who have been abused by their caregivers. The organization stages a Day of Mourning in the spring during which names of disabled people killed by caregivers are read aloud. London's name will be added to the list, said Ne'eman. ""We need to see images of London smiling, having fun,"" he said. ""We need to look at this case, first and foremost, as the murder of a 6-year-old boy."" Anna Bullard is a Georgia mother whose daughter has autism. Bullard advocates in state government for more services for parents like her. She says she has trouble feeling sympathy for Jillian McCabe. Her daughter is 10. ""When she was diagnosed, doctors told me she had no skills whatever,"" said Bullard. ""I could imagine nothing except spending my life trying to get her what she deserves. ""We all have points in our life where we have to ask for help and that's just what you have to do,"" she said. ""I don't know if that's the case here. No one knows. But you find a way.

"(CNN) -- Operation El Dorado Canyon, authorized by President Ronald Reagan and launched on April 14, 1986, entailed the bombing of military and terrorist installations in Tripoli, Libya. The attack was ordered partly in retaliation for Libya's role in the bombing of a West Berlin discotheque that claimed the life of two U.S. servicemen and a Turkish citizen while injuring more than 200 people, including many Americans. Reagan also described the U.S. attack on Libya as a ""pre-emptive action ... (designed to) diminish Col. (Moammar Gadhafi's) capacity to export terror."" He warned, ""If necessary, we shall do it again."" Criticized by Western European allies, the U.S. maneuver was endorsed by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Speaking at the House of Commons on April 15, she reasoned that ""Article 51 of the U.N. Charter specifically recognizes the right of self-defense. In view of Libya's promotion of terrorism, the failure of peaceful means to deter it and the evidence that further attacks were threatened, I replied to the (U.S.) president that we would support action directed against specific Libyan targets. ..."" Since her passing Monday, Margaret Hilda Thatcher's role in the unraveling of the Cold War has been widely assessed. Indeed, her declaration the year before Mikhail Gorbachev became the Soviet general secretary presaged the future: ""I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do business together."" Less well recognized, however, is Thatcher's admonition about the gathering threat of international terrorism. Supporting Reagan's Libya raid was a tough call. Despite the escalation in state-sponsored terrorism in the 1980s, France refused over-flight rights for the F-111 bomber that would undertake the strike against Libya, and the leaders of Germany, Italy and Spain refused to assist the U.S. effort. Arguments against involvement in the conflict included possible Libyan reprisals on Western European targets, disruption of financial transactions with Libya, risks of greater Libyan-Soviet collaboration and the encouragement of U.S. militarism. Denis Healey, a leader of the Labour Party's shadow government, and Dr. David Owen, leader of the Social Democrats and former Labour foreign secretary, were among the many British politicians who denounced Thatcher's stance. A Gallup Poll at the time revealed that about 65% of the British public questioned for the survey disapproved of the U.S. raid. Even Thatcher's defense of the U.S. action was not unqualified. Four days before the attack, Reagan noted in his diary that she had sent him ""a long message pledging support but expressing concern about possible civilian casualties."" In his memoir, Secretary of State George Shultz recalls that ""Prime Minister Thatcher said yes to our request for use of U.S. F-111s from U.S. bases in Britain, but she made it clear that we needed to make public our evidence against (Gadhafi), that we should limit the targets to those with clear terrorist connections, and that our retaliation should be 'proportionate.' "" On December 27, 1985, 20 people had been killed, including five Americans, when the El Al ticket counters were bombed at the Rome and Vienna airports. The Reagan administration considered Abu Nidal a terrorist organization, and declared that it had undertaken the attacks with support from Gadhafi. The Libyan leader reportedly called the bombings ""heroic."" Reagan responded on January 7, 1986, with an executive order that imposed restrictions on trade with Libya. On March 24, while undertaking peaceful naval exercises in the Gulf of Sidra, U.S. forces were struck by Libyan surface-to-air missiles. The United States returned fire, targeting Libyan military installations. By the time the discotheque was bombed in West Berlin, the pattern of Libya-supported terrorism and aggression toward the United States was incontrovertible. However, Thatcher alone would stand with Reagan as he sought to stop Gadhafi. The retaliation against Libya didn't stop the terrorist threat. On December 21, 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland. The 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground were killed by a bomb attack, which the Reagan administration blamed on Gadhafi. It was not until April 1999 that the Libyan government turned over the suspects, who were brought to trial in the Netherlands. And it was not until 2003 that Gadhafi's government took responsibility for the atrocity and agreed to pay compensation to the victims. Gadhafi claimed, however, that he never ordered the bombing. Despite Libya's ongoing acts of terrorism and the growing global threat from radical Islam in the 1980s and 1990s, many European and American leaders were loath to contend that Gadhafi's actions were anything more than isolated incidents. Thatcher's statement on April 15, 1986, the day after the U.S. strike in Libya was, prescient: ""Libya has been behind much of it (terrorism) and was planning more."" In the current era of U.S. drone warfare, Thatcher's nuanced support for air attacks on terrorists and their installations is worth reviewing. By making the case that the United States had the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, she was positioning Western responses to the emerging war against terrorists in the context of an international legal framework. Thatcher repeatedly called for careful targeting in air raids to protect innocent human life, and she was deeply concerned about preventing retaliation from turning into military escalation. She was clear-eyed about a threat that many could not see while the Cold War still raged. ""Terrorism is a scourge of the modern age,"" she cautioned. Those who currently question whether the West is in a global war against terrorism and who would prefer not to speak of the tragedy of Benghazi would do well to review Thatcher's stance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kiron K. Skinner.","Kiron Skinner: Margaret Thatcher gave crucial support to anti-terror efforts .

"Washington (CNN) -- A group that's working to keep Democrats in control of the Senate is releasing its first television ad in the contested U.S. Senate race in Alaska between incumbent Sen. Mark Begich and his GOP challenger, Dan Sullivan. The ""multi-million dollar"" ad buy from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee comes as Begich's campaign faces a slew of negative headlines for releasing a political attack ad that focused on a gruesome 2013 murder and sexual assault case. The DSCC said it was already planning to go up with the new 30-second spot before the recent controversy, and the ad doesn't mention Begich's ad. Rather, it hits Dan Sullivan for opposing Obamacare. In the commercial, an elderly woman whose husband has Alzheimer's disease says Sullivan ""supports a plan"" to slash Medicare benefits, and his policies would raise prescription drug costs. In the commercial, an elderly woman whose husband has Alzheimer's disease says Sullivan ""supports a plan"" to slash Medicare benefits, and his policies would raise prescription drug costs. Fact Check: Would repeal of Obamacare hike seniors' drug costs? According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Alaska has the largest growth rate for seniors (age 65 and older); the population for that age group increased by 54% between 2000 and 2010. The ad also hits Sullivan for saying he's open to raising the minimum age for Social Security eligibility. While Sullivan has advocated for reform for younger generations, he has said ""we're not going to touch"" benefits for seniors who are either receiving Social Security benefits or about to receive them. ""But with the younger generation, to phase in reform, there is opportunity,"" he said last month at the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce GOP debate. CNN rates the race between Sullivan and Begich as one of six toss-up contests in this year's midterm elections. As a Democratic senator in a reliably red state, Begich is considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election. Republicans need a net gain of six seats to retake the majority in the Senate. The DSCC also has spent money on ads in Arkansas, North Carolina, Louisiana, Iowa, Colorado and Michigan. The new spot comes as Begich is under hot water after his campaign went up with a Willie Horton-style ad against Sullivan on Friday. The spot accused Sullivan of being soft on crime, focusing on a case in which a man allegedly murdered an elderly couple last year and sexually assaulted the couple's granddaughter, as well as another elderly woman in the home. At the time of the crime, the suspect had just finished a prison sentence of four years for another crime. His sentence should have been longer because his record included a separate felony, but he was only sentenced to four years because of a mistake by the state. Because Sullivan was serving as attorney general at the time of the suspect's sentencing in 2010, Begich's campaign tried to fault Sullivan for letting the suspect go early. However, the mistake that led to the short sentence was made before Sullivan became attorney general. Politifact gave the ad a ""Pants on fire"" rating, saying the ad ""is not only inaccurate, it makes an inflammatory accusation."" Shortly after the spot aired, the victims' family called on Begich and Sullivan, who had released his own ad countering the claims, to pull down their spots, saying the publicity could affect the jury pool for the trial scheduled for this month. Sullivan's campaign asked TV stations to stop running the ad Sunday, while Begich's team first said it would alter the ad to remove references to the case. The campaign later pulled down the ad altogether.","The DSCC is spending money against the GOP challenger in Alaska's Senate race .

"Washington (CNN) -- Mitch McConnell could soon get a taste of just how daunting it is to run the Senate after years of slamming Democrats for mismanaging the chamber. If he wins his re-election battle in Kentucky and Republicans take control of the Senate in next week's elections, McConnell will be the next majority leader. But the celebrating might not last long. If he wants to get anything done, McConnell will need to corral an ideologically diverse caucus -- and seek a truce with at least some out-of-power Democrats -- in a narrowly divided chamber where compromises might be tough to reach. Most bills won't advance without 60 votes -- a threshold Republicans are unlikely to reach in next week's election. And he'll have to do it against a backdrop of the looming 2016 elections when both the Senate and the White House will again be up for grabs. That could be especially challenging for McConnell since several members of his conference -- including Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio -- could launch presidential bids next year and will face competing political priorities. ""It might be somewhat dysfunctional,"" said American University Prof. James Thurber, a congressional expert, who explained that because of this ""permanent campaign"" it will be very hard for McConnell to get anything passed. ""It's not going to be pretty, in my opinion."" In their perfect world, Republicans -- who have not controlled the Senate since 2006 -- would use their new power to showcase to voters they can pass legislation and run the chamber smoothly and with bipartisan input. That means getting enough Democratic votes to pass budgets, spending bills and other GOP priorities -- such as the Keystone XL pipeline, a slew of House-passed jobs bills and changes to Obamacare -- with a 60 vote filibuster-proof threshold. Doing so would help Republicans argue they should stay in charge after the next election. ""The basic functions of Congress are gone and we'd like to restore that,"" a Republican aide said. McConnell, whose soft-spoken demeanor masks the hardball political fighter within, is in many ways the perfect leader for such a cause. He is known as a smart legislative tactician, who cuts deals with Democrats when needed, even though he has poor personal relations with his Democratic counterpart, Harry Reid, and President Barack Obama. But cutting deals might be more difficult next year because of powerful conflicting forces in the Senate GOP caucus. There is a large group of Republican senators from purple or blue states -- including Rob Portman of Ohio and Pennsylvania's Pat Toomey -- who are up for re-election and need to appeal to a broader base of voters. They might see compromise as the best way to hold their seats and keep Republicans in power. But the party also includes three tea party senators with presidential ambitions -- Cruz, Paul and Rubio -- who are likely to oppose efforts by McConnell to move bills that don't meet their strict ideological standards. Democrats marvel at the prospects of McConnell trying to reconcile these forces. ""They'll be crawling all over each other to get further and further to the right and there is no way that doesn't impact what's going on in the Senate,"" said one Democratic aide about the impact of potential tea party presidential candidates. ""McConnell is going to have to deal with the general tea party strengths that have existed the last several years and it's only going to be stronger on the Senate floor when you have three of their guys clamoring for that part of the vote in a presidential primary."" Before McConnell can become majority leader he must stave off a robust challenge in his Kentucky Senate race from Democrat Allison Grimes if he is to win a sixth term. That race appears headed to the wire. If he wins control of the chamber, McConnell will have to deal with the likes of Cruz and Paul, who have been thorns in the side of Harry Reid, the current Senate majority leader. They have commandeered the floor in high-profile fights against Obama's policies. As a sign that might continue under GOP control, Cruz already has warned Senate leaders that he will oppose efforts in the post-election lame duck session to move anything but must-pass legislation. He wants to leave other issues for the newly elected Congress, even though some Republican leaders would like to clear as many pending matters as possible so Republicans can get started with a clean slate in January. In the upcoming 2016 election cycle, Republicans will have defend 24 seats while Democrats will have to protect just 10. About 14 GOP-held seats are from purple or blue states such as North Carolina, Ohio, New Hampshire, and Florida that Democrats think they can win back. Republicans worry Democrats will do whatever they can do make Republicans look like they are unfit to govern. ""The Democrats see an opportunity to keep the White House in 2016 and pick up seats and get the majority back in,"" the GOP aide said. ""The Dems see this and they are going to do everything they can over the next two years so we can't get accomplishments."" ""If they put forward reasonable bills, I'm sure they will earn some Democratic support,"" the Democratic aide said. ""But I think the tea party folks are so absolutist it's a real risk for McConnell and his leadership to move anything toward the middle and pick up Democratic votes."" One open question is whether the McConnell-led GOP conference will try to restore changes in filibuster rules put in place by Democrats this Congress. Right now, aides say a decision hasn't been reached. The rule change made it easier for Democrats to confirm the president's nominees. Republicans condemned it as a power play that damaged the long term health of the Senate. The disagreement poisoned the already sour relationship between McConnell and Reid. McConnell often notes that divided government -- where one party controls Congress and the other the White House -- has led to some of the biggest deals on some of the thorniest issues in recent decades, including reforms of welfare, Social Security and the tax code. ""If you have one party in the Congress and one party at the White House, there is no incentive for them to attack each other because they're both involved and it makes it easier to do something, assuming both sides want to get involved,"" the GOP aide said. But the Democratic aide wasn't as optimistic: ""My gut tells me that the bad feeling that run on both sides sort of make both sides leery of coming together on something big,"" the aide said.","Mitch McConnell is in line to be the next Senate Majority Leader if Republicans control the chamber .

"(CNN) -- ""Less is more"" has reigned at the beach and the neighborhood pool when it comes to swimwear ever since the popularization of the bikini in the 20th century. Two-piece bathing suits might dominate the landscape, but style editors and trend forecasters say the one-piece is the ""fashion-forward"" choice this season. ""Most people are going to be in two-pieces. If you show up in a one-piece it's definitely a statement, and it's one of the most comfortable statements you could possibly make at the beach,"" said Connie Wang, style director of lifestyle website Refinery29. ""It's a good thing for women that there are so many more options now that fulfill different desires of what you want to achieve at the beach."" Variations on the one-piece and other swimwear trends will be on display at Miami Swim Week, where designers and buyers will gather this weekend for two major industry events: Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Swim and SwimShow. READ MORE: Caftans, your timeless summer wardrobe . Surf-inspired looks, such as rash vests and long-sleeved onesies for women, are expected to make strong showings, said Jane Boddy, head of womenswear at trend forecaster WGSN. On the flip side, ultra-feminine styles flaunting details rooted in the world of intimates -- ruffles, straps and peek-a-boo cutouts -- ""are also key and on the cusp of big success,"" she said. The one-piece is the perfect canvas for showcasing both styles, whether you prefer ruffles and lace or animal prints. ""The one-piece has become popular again because it reflects the best of both worlds. It looks back to the past with a retro slant, while also retaining a fresh, forward-looking style,"" Boddy said. ""The development in cutting-edge design is the driving force behind the one-piece movement, as is the emergence of active sports in the apparel market,"" Boddy said. ""We're beginning to see these looks filtering into swim, too, and that's exciting."" While the bikini holds the undisputed title for the sexiest swimsuit option, let's not forget iconic moments for the one-piece such as Farrah Fawcett's ubiquitous red bathing suit poster and Bo Derek's emergence from the ocean in ""10."" More recently, when Kim Kardashian decided to show off her post-baby body on Instagram, she did it in a one-piece, proving that it is possible to flaunt a great body and get (slightly) more coverage at the same time. Jumpstarted by the ""Mad Men""-inspired retro craze permeating all aspects of fashion, one-pieces are now easier than ever to find in a variety of styles, cuts and prints on the racks of department stores and high-end boutiques. READ MORE: What the late '60s really looked like . ""Retro-fit swimsuits are flattering to a multitude of body types, but they also offer a whimsical take on swim and beach outfits,"" Refinery29's Connie Wang said. In recent years, the retro craze has given way to bathing suit styles inspired by the 1990s with an emphasis on high-cut legs, scoop necks and backs, think Pamela Anderson in ""Baywatch"" or ""American Apparel."" J.Crew pledged to reissue a discontinued scoop-back swimsuit after a New York magazine contributor penned an impassioned plea asking them to resurrect it. ""People are valuing mobility and athleticism and actually being able to do stuff in the stuff you're wearing,"" Wang said. The modern version of the one-piece dates back to the 1980s, when the fitness craze contributed to an emphasis on sportiness, mobility and functionality in swimwear, said fashion historian Valerie Steele. At the same time, the ""retro sexy"" look of the 1950s and 1960s started coming back into style, after a period when two-pieces and unstructured one-pieces ruled swimwear. Developments in textiles allowed designers to create more flattering and functional styles, allowing bathing beauties to choose between ""heightened eroticism or heightened athleticism,"" said Steele, director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. Since then, the one-piece never really went out of style, but the pendulum has swung back in its favor, she said. ""We are in a one-piece moment."" Caitlin Schmidt contributed to this report.","Style experts say the one-piece is the fashion-forward choice this season .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Thursday night that it ""may be appropriate"" for him to appoint a czar to lead his administration's response to Ebola. ""It may make sense for us to have one person ... so that after this initial surge of activity, we can have a more regular process just to make sure that we're crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's going forward,"" Obama said. His comments to reporters in the Oval Office came after a meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden, Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco and others. Obama pointed to those two as the leaders of the U.S. response to Ebola so far. He said they've done an ""outstanding job"" so far, but that with flu season coming and Homeland Security officials also involved in combatting ISIS, ""they also are responsible for a whole bunch of other stuff."" Obama also said he has no ""philosophical objection"" to a ban on travel between West Africa and the United States. But said that doing so could make it tougher to determine whether passengers entering the United States from elsewhere had recently visited the region that's at the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. He said a ""flat-out travel ban is not the way to go"" and that it's less effective than other steps the United States has already taken. Some lawmakers have clamored in recent days for a travel ban, arguing that the United States should be able to track international passengers from the origins of their flights. ""You ought to look at at least immediately suspending visas for non-U.S. nationals,"" GOP Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana told Obama administration officials at a House committee hearing Thursday.","Tom Frieden of the CDC and Lisa Monaco of Homeland Security have led effort so far .

"(CNN) -- Republicans now have the Senate Majority and control of Congress going into next year. This means there can be no excuses for why bipartisan solutions designed to help the American people cannot pass the Senate and land on the President Barack Obama's desk for his signature. But winning this election is not enough. Republicans must be prepared to not only keep the Senate in 2016, but also build a foundation that will preserve their majority for the next several cycles. Republicans will have to thread the needle between opposing the President and pushing forward their own agenda. Congressional Republicans must show they can truly govern and try to avoid excessive high profile fights that are only popular to the party's base. Republicans won because the President's policies were on the ballot and so were the many incumbents who supported them. The electoral atmosphere could not have been better for the GOP, as the White House mishandled many issues, such as the IRS scandal, the immigration crisis, the growing crisis with ISIS in the Middle East and the health scares over Ebola in the United States. It's an exciting moment for the GOP because it can showcase its policies. Toward the end of the Bush administration, we had lost our way and wandered into the wilderness and let the other side take control. For the first time in eight years, Republicans will have the chance to demonstrate that they are the party of common sense ideas, because they will run the entire show on Capitol Hill. They can start the process of putting in place a smarter, leaner and transparent government that restores freedom, grows the economy and creates more jobs. Figuring out ways to unleash the American potential will be the solution to keeping a lasting Republican majority. Now is the time for party leaders, rank-and-file members of Congress and governors to come forward and present the best ideas our party has to offer. We have two steady hands at the helm with Speaker John Boehner and soon-to-be Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. They do not overreact in times of intense legislative drama and are able to negotiate solid deals in order to move the ball forward without giving up their core conservative values. In addition, Republican lieutenants like House Majority Leader Kevi McCarthy, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise and Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn are all loyal and very able leaders to help implement the party's agenda. Time is not on the GOP's side. Republicans have a very limited window to demonstrate that they are the party of real change. They have next year to push through legislation to the President's desk for his signature. That is why Republicans must not get caught up in the 2016 election year cycle before presidential politics takes over. If the GOP focuses too much on who sits in the Oval Office too early, many of the party's efforts will end up in legislative quicksand. Yes, there will be several high-profile senators who will be positioning themselves for a presidential run, but the focus of House-Senate efforts must not change because of them. There is serious work to be done. The GOP must unveil an agenda that addresses tax reform, reins in spending, offers regulatory reform for business growth, tackles energy issues, pushes through trade deals and improves our educational system. While we can continue to show why Obamacare remains a failure, we do not have 60 votes in the Senate to repeal it. But we can make some changes, such as repealing the medical device tax. If Obama and Senate Democrats reject these ideas through the veto pen or the filibuster, it will be obvious to Americans just who is obstructing progress. Immigration, however, remains the elephant in the room for Republicans. The President is likely going to move his chess piece on this first issue through executive orders this year. While the GOP won't ever have an amnesty style bill that the Democrats have proposed in the past, Republicans must offer a version of immigration reform in order to attract Hispanic voters and take the issue off the table. Speaker of the House John Boehner constantly reminded Americans that hundreds of bills that have passed the House now remain trapped in the United States Senate. That talking point will no longer exist under Republican control. While members of the GOP are slapping each other on the back for the hard-fought and well-deserved victory, the Republican brand still remains stagnant outside the beltway and must be fixed. The starting bell for next year has already rung. It's time for Republicans to shine and prove that they can successfully navigate this new journey forward. The election victory is theirs to build upon, or lose again very shortly.","Ron Bonjean: Winning the midterm elections is not enough for Republicans .

"(CNN) -- Golfing prodigies just keep getting younger. The latest name to wow the sport is 11-year-old Lucy Li, who made her own slice of history on Monday. She is officially the youngest player to qualify for the U.S. Women's Open after securing her place at an event in her native California. Li, from Redwood Shores, shot rounds of 74 and 68 at Half Moon Bay Golf Club to beat the field by seven shots and book her place at Pinehurst next month. She beats the previous mark held by fellow American Lexi Thompson, who qualified for the 2007 installment aged 12. But Li won't be the youngest to compete at the tournament -- that honor is still held by Beverley Klass, who competed in 1967 aged just 10 without having to qualify. Li already has a victory at the world famous Augusta National under her belt, having won the inaugural Drive, Chip and Putt Championship at the Masters venue in April. Now she'll be heading to Pinehurst as the third major event of the women's season follows on directly after the men's tournament at the same venue on June 17 for the first time in its history. Li was one of those to make it from the United States Golf Association's first international qualifying events, which took place in America, England, China, Japan and Korea. All of the 17 women to qualify will be making their first appearance at the U.S. Open, with another raft of events running right through until the end of May. At The Buckinghamshire course just outside London, England, 20-year-old Amy Boulden from Wales qualified first just weeks after her first professional win. ""I'm very happy. I played very well today, so I'm very pleased,"" said Boulden, who was one of eight players to make the cut. ""I knew there were a lot of good players, but I still felt quite confident. ""I've grown up playing with a lot of the girls playing, so I just tried to play my own game and I knew that if you were under par you were probably going to qualify here. ""It's one of the biggest majors, so I'm looking forward to going to the States and playing against the best players in the world.""","Lucy Li becomes youngest ever qualifier for women's U.S. Open aged just 11 .

"(CNN) -- If you're going to break hearts, at least be classy about it. Yes, ""Sherlock"" star Benedict Cumberbatch is engaged to director and actress Sophie Hunter -- cue the crying emojis from some fans on Twitter -- but the actor revealed the news in a refreshingly humble way. Instead of releasing a statement through an army of publicists or posting a photo of engagement rings on Instagram, Cumberbatch went old-school and posted an engagement notice in the Wednesday edition of UK paper The Times. The six-line notice under ""forthcoming marriages"" is so straightforward, it would be easy to read past it before realizing that it's taking about THE Benedict Cumberbatch: ""The engagement is announced between Benedict, son of Wanda and Timothy Cumberbatch of London, and Sophie, daughter of Katharine Hunter of Edinburgh and Charles Hunter of London."" The lack of fanfare isn't unusual for Cumberbatch, 38, and Hunter, 36, as they've kept their romance under the radar. The couple, who met on the set of the 2009 movie ""Burlesque Fairytales,"" weren't seen together publicly until the French Open this year. Still, the news of a Cumberbatch wedding is a tough pill to swallow for some admirers. As his star rose with roles in ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" the charming actor has become an international heartthrob. Twitter has (predictably) gone into mourning: . ""First George (Clooney). Now Benedict,"" tweeted one fan. ""It's a cruel, cruel world..."" ""Best wishes to #BenedictCumberbatch and #SophieHunter. May you live happily ever after,"" said another.

"(CNN) -- It's an unforgiving place, 45,000 feet above the Earth. It's brutally cold up there, as low as 59 degrees below zero, and there's so little air to breathe, it takes just seconds to pass out. It's at least 10,000 feet above the typical cruising altitude for a passenger jet, a full 3 miles above the peak of Mount Everest, and a staggering 6 miles higher than your typical skydiving altitude. This is where SpaceShipTwo disintegrated Friday, high above the Southern California desert. Pilot Peter Siebold survived the crash. Co-pilot Michael Tyner Alsbury died. Why one died and the other lived is unknown, said CNN aviation consultant Miles O'Brien. ""There's a million things,"" he said. ""What's amazing is that Siebold is alive,"" he said. ""There must be an amazing story of either luck or sheer will that he's living."" Whatever happened, it's a sure bet the pilots thought about and trained for failures similar to the one that caused the experimental craft to break up, he said. ""Everything about test flying is, 'What's going to go wrong now,' "" O'Brien said. Test pilots, by definition, work in extreme environments. They're always chasing some superlative -- higher, faster, never done -- usually in unproven aircraft fresh off the design board. And they often do it with a minimum of survival gear, which adds complication and weight to airframes under testing, O'Brien said. Like the space shuttle and other spacecraft before that, SpaceShipTwo didn't have ejection seats, O'Brien said. To escape a disintegrating, spinning craft, its pilots might have to claw their way along a rope mesh to escape. And while they wore helmets with oxygen, they weren't dressed in full-pressure suits -- not that it would have probably meant much in this case, O'Brien said. After all, Siebold survived without one. Still, the thin air makes quick reactions crucial. At 45,000 feet, pilots who lose their masks or oxygen canisters can expect to have nine to 15 seconds of effective performance time before the lack of oxygen takes hold, according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. And while some on the ground are looking up, questioning the value of expending human life on commercial spaceflight, the test pilots themselves have a different perspective, as Virgin Galactic owner Richard Branson told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Monday. ""Yes, the risk is worth it,"" Branson said. ""And as I say, Mike would have been the first to say that. I'm sure his parents and his wife and his sisters would not say that, but test pilots would say that because they know the risk they're taking. That they know the importance of what they're doing."" O'Brien, who has been critical of the ease with which Branson and others have portrayed future space travel, agreed. ""These guys go into it completely with their eyes wide open,"" he said. ""There's always going to be people who want to do that."" CNN's Holly Yan, Susannah Cullinane, Ric Ward, Rosalina Nieves, Mayra Cuevas, Mike Ahlers and Sonya Hamasaki contributed to this report.","Experimental craft SpaceShipTwo broke up at 45,000 feet, amid cold, thin air .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Columbus Short's wife swears the ""Scandal"" actor threatened to kill her and himself with a knife last week. The allegation is part of Tanee Short's affidavit filed Tuesday asking for a restraining order to keep her husband away from her and their 2-year-old daughter. She also filed for divorce after almost nine years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. A judge signed a temporary restraining order and set a hearing for May 6 to decide whether it would be extended. Columbus Short, 31, plays Harrison Wright, a member of fixer Olivia Pope's team, on the hit ABC series. In a statement Thursday to CNN, the actor said he would refrain from sharing his side of the story. ""As you all know, lately my personal life has been subjected to a lot of press. As much as I would like to provide my side of events, my counsel has instructed me that a Court of law is the only and proper venue to deal with such matters,"" Short said in the statement. ""Accordingly, I must refrain from making any comments even though that is very difficult for me under the circumstances. Thank you to my fans for your continued support during this difficult time."" According to court filings, the actor has been to jail at least three times for violence in the past three months. Tanee Short's sworn statement described an April 7 incident at the couple's Los Angeles County home when her husband allegedly was intoxicated and threatened to hit her with a wine bottle after he ""dumped the wine on me."" He then ""grabbed a knife from the kitchen"" and ""pinned me on the couch and began to choke me,"" she said. ""He placed the knife close to my neck and threatened to kill me and then kill himself."" Her husband demanded they play ""a game he called 'Truth or Truth'"" in which he randomly listed ""names of people we know and accused me of having an affair."" He stabbed the couch or other furniture each time she denied an affair, she said. Tanee Short said she grabbed her daughter, ran to her car and drove away. She realized after driving two miles that one of her tires had been slashed, she said. The affidavit also described two alleged incidents of violence in February at the couple's home. In each instance, Columbus Short was taken to jail by police who responded to his wife's 911 call, the statement said. The actor woke his wife on the morning of February 3 and choked her before chasing her around the house and ""constantly threatening me,"" she said. He ""pushed me and started screaming that I need to leave"" during a February 18 argument, she said. She called police with her nanny's cell phone after her husband shattered her phone, according to the sworn statement. Short was charged with felony battery after a fight in which he allegedly punched and knocked out a man at a West Los Angeles restaurant last month, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said in a statement. He was released from jail on $50,000 bail. HLN's Selin Darkalstanian and CNN's Joan Yeam contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I must refrain from making any comments,"" Columbus Short tells CNN .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Police evicted 200 Bedouins from their homes in a southern Israeli village on Tuesday and demolished their dwellings, an act decried by residents who said they are on ancestral land. The move occurred five miles north of Beer Sheva in a village called Al-Araqeeb, an enclave not recognized by the state of Israel. Witnesses told CNN that the Israeli forces arrived at the village accompanied by busloads of civilians who cheered as the dwellings were demolished. They said armed police deployed with tear gas, water cannon, two helicopters and bulldozers. But Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said there were no disturbances and the operation went according to plan. He said the move was in response to a court order and people had been settling there illegally. Rosenfeld said there were about 30 shacks and 200 people removed. Villagers said they've lived in the region for years back to the Ottoman days before Israel was founded, and have original deeds to the land. After the Israeli forces left the scene, some villagers immediately started rebuilding their dwellings. ""The state of Israel is treating us like cockroaches,"" said Sulaiman Abu Mdian, 29, a father of four who works as a chicken farmer.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The return of electricity spread slowly Saturday across northern Japan, where hundreds were injured and tens of thousands remained without power after one of the strongest aftershocks following last month's devastating earthquake struck the region. Nearly 250,000 were still waiting for their lights to come on as crews rushed to repair damaged water and gas lines. At least 283 people were injured by Thursday's 7.1-magnitude aftershock alone. It was blamed for two deaths; intial reports indicated a few more deaths, though the causes of those could not be directly tied to the aftershock. Japan is still reeling for the the massive magnitude 9.0 earthquake that slammed the nation on March 11, sparking a nuclear crisis. The death told from that quake and the resulting tsunami stood at 12,921 on Saturday, with nearly 15,000 people still missing, according to Japan's National Police Agency. Communities across northern Japan planned to hold solemn commemorations Monday, including moments of silence to mark one month since the disaster struck. A Japanese researcher said Friday that residents in eastern Japan, including Tokyo, can expect more such aftershocks in the coming months. ""We should not be surprised to have magnitude-7 level aftershocks even a year afterward anywhere as wide as east Japan in the wake of such mega-quake of magnitude 9,"" said Satoko Oki of the Earthquake Research Institute of Tokyo University. Meanwhile, a key transportation hub in Sendai -- one of the areas worst hit by last month's quake -- is preparing to start up operations again. Limited commercial service at the airfield south of the city and near the coast will be restored April 13, authorities and airlines said. ""As a result of efforts aiding recovery by the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, the self-defense force, the U.S. military and other organizations, the airport is being opened sooner than originally expected,"" Japanese airline ANA said in a statement. ANA said it will make three ""relief"" flights daily to and from Tokyo's Haneda airport, while rival Japan Airlines said it will operate three flights a day into the airport from Tokyo and Osaka. The re-opening of the airfield will bring relief to the region, which is still without express train service. Many roads and dozens of railroad lines and stations also were knocked out by the disaster. Currently, the airlines believe that, at the earliest, they will be able to restore regular service by the end of May.","The aftershock was one of the strongest since the March 11 quake .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Basketball star Lisa Leslie battled her way from the courts of Inglewood, California, to the upper echelons of the WNBA to become one of the most popular women's basketball players of all time. After retiring from play, Leslie finds herself in a new fight -- to gain respect for her beloved sport. ""It's a constant battle,"" she says. ""I feel like I'm an activist for women in sports."" Marking its 17th season this year, the Women's National Basketball Association is the country's longest-running professional women's sports league. But the quest for fans, sponsors and exposure in a sports world dominated by men can be slow, and tough. The league will celebrate the 27th annual National Girls and Women in Sports Day on Wednesday, with several community events across the country. The occasion will honor female achievement in sports. But some say U.S. attitudes have a long way to go. How women cracked tennis' glass ceiling . Leslie was one of the pioneer players in the league. During her 12 seasons in the WNBA, she won three Most Valuable Player trophies -- not to mention four Olympic gold medals. She also scored her place in women's basketball history when she became the first professional player to slam dunk during a game back in 2002. Now, as co-owner of her former team, the Los Angeles Sparks, she is looking for a slam dunk in the form of financial support. ""It's difficult to get corporate sponsors to really buy in and spend some of those corporate dollars on women's sports,"" she says. The WNBA says that team sponsorships rose more than 10 percent in 2012 from the prior season. Still, Leslie calls her task tough, even with support from the NBA. Leslie says the women's league is growing, ""but it would be nice to get more fans supporting the WNBA and more women supporting women in sports."" Top player Tina Charles says there is an unfair attitude toward women's sports in the United States. ""I don't think we get a lot of media coverage the way that I wish we could,"" she says. The center for the Connecticut Sun was the WNBA's MVP last season. Still, speaking to CNN from Krakow, Poland, where she is playing in the offseason, she says she is pleased with the WNBA's progress, and that playing for the league has been a dream come true. ""I think we have a lot to show with the way we play,"" she says. ""...how hard we play, how competitive we are, just to show that there is another avenue for girls, another outlet for girls."" But building a fan base and profitability takes time. It also takes canny leadership. ""We are in no way resting on our laurels,"" says WNBA President Laurel Richie, who came to the league in 2011 from Girl Scouts of the USA, where she was chief marketing officer. ""But we do take some comfort in the fact that it takes a while to get a league and all teams up and running and to profitability."" Expanding exposure is another challenge. Richie points to ESPN2's plan to broadcast the WNBA draft in prime time this year. Last year marked the first time ESPN televised the draft lottery at all. Experts agree that watching women play in a professional arena is inspiring for girls. And it helps convince them to play sports themselves -- a huge benefit for their development. ""It's really stunning,"" says Nancy Hogshead-Makar, senior director of advocacy for the Women's Sports Foundation. ""The changes are profound for the rest of [a girl's] life."" Hogshead-Makar, who won three gold medals as an Olympic swimmer, says playing sports teaches girls about winning and losing, belonging to a team, and postponing short-term gratification for long-term rewards. She says that those skills ""translate directly into tangible educational gains, and economic gains."" Sports can also help teenagers during an awkward time in their development. Lisa Leslie credits basketball with shaping her character, as well as her career. Analysis: 40 years after Title IX, more women in high school sports . She started playing for a simple reason, she says: ""I wanted to be popular."" But impressing her classmates was hardly the only benefit. ""I found playing basketball really became the most important aspect of who I am today,"" Leslie says. ""When you play sports, you're more likely not to do drugs, you're more likely not to have early pregnancy."" WNBA players and executives alike see community outreach as part of the league's mandate. Tina Charles donated $32,000 of her own money to help build a school in Mali. Kelly Loeffler, co-owner and co-chairman of the Atlanta Dream, says she was drawn to the league when she first saw a game. She thought there was a tremendous product, without the recognition it deserved. ""It was the opportunity to solve that business challenge,"" Loeffler says, ""...while being a part of the growing movement towards growth in professional women's sports."" She credits her players with filling key roles in the community and helping to win fans among girls, and boys. By building awareness, women's sports fans hope to create more support for women on the court. One of the most famous female athletes in the country, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, credits Title IX, a 1972 law barring discrimination in school sports, for creating equal opportunities for girls. ""With Title IX, the opportunity for girls in sports is such a blessing,"" says Joyner-Kersee. ""I can never imagine the women who came before me, who didn't have the same opportunities that I had."" She broke records with her Olympic heptathlon performances. Now, she reaches out to young people through grassroots programs, like the Triple Play wellness program through the Boys and Girls Clubs. Experts agree the race isn't over for equality in sports, particularly in the coaching industry. Hogshead-Makar says women are locked out of jobs that would have them coaching men at the university and professional levels. ""It's probably the most sex-segregated industry out there,"" she says. ""The industry of coaching men. It's less than 2%."" Still, she's optimistic about the future. ""(With) those numbers?"" she says. ""You can only go up.""","The 27th annual National Girls and Women in Sports Day is Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- After a deadly earthquake and tsunami struck Japan last Friday, response team members from ShelterBox were on the ground within 24 hours. The organization, founded by 2008 CNN Hero Tom Henderson, provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies to families affected by disasters. These essentials come in a large, green box that shares the organization's name. With an initial 600 ShelterBoxes en route to thousands of survivors in northern Japan, Henderson's group is doing whatever it can to help a country in crisis. Henderson spoke with CNN's Allie Torgan about nuclear fears and his group's ongoing efforts in Japan. CNN: How did you mobilize your team into action when you heard about the earthquake? Tom Henderson: Within minutes, we were moving. We look at our resources, what we've got available, where our teams are around the world and how quickly we can get people on the ground. We're fortunate that we've got boxes positioned in different parts of the world and we've got our response team members around the world. Within an hour, we were looking at our people going, ""Go jump on an airplane, group together in Tokyo, and let's get this thing moving."" We had our first people on the ground within 24 hours. There are boxes leaving every day in different numbers. We've got people monitoring our team on the ground minute by minute. CNN: How are fears of nuclear catastrophe affecting ground operations? Henderson: Every disaster's unusual, this particularly so because of the nuclear problem that's unfolding. We're monitoring it hour by hour, and we've got some world experts advising us on what's happening. We don't want to put people in harm's way. We have to take advice from the experts and, of course, there's an exclusion zone, so we're not operating in that exclusion zone. Unfortunately, that exclusion zone does encompass a lot of the most-devastated areas. But there's other work that's going on, more assessments that are being done and operational things we put in place. Of course, working with the local community, we want to find out (who are) the most needy people. CNN: Reports are out saying that millions of households throughout Japan have no access to safe drinking water. How will ShelterBox address this and other needs? Henderson: Clean water is becoming a problem, as will food very shortly. In every one of our boxes, we have what we call a family life straw. It's a water-cleaning device, and it will clean enough water for 10 people for 12 months. You simply pour the dirty water in. It's a mechanical device -- a filter system that has very clever silver chloride filters and iodine -- and it gives out clean water. That's included in every one of our boxes. As a situation unfolds and the detail comes back, we coordinate with the local community and find out exactly what is useful. There's always different (items) in the boxes. The box itself is usually useful. The tent, which is now universally known as one of the best aid tents in the world, is designed to keep people warm when it's cold and cool when it's hot. And (there are) state-of-the-art blankets because it's very cold. CNN: You and your teams have been working nonstop for the last week. What keeps you going? Henderson: What keeps us going is very simple. It is that desperate need to help people as quickly as we can. And that's infectious in our organization. There are over a million people in our tents now in over 60 countries around the world in the most difficult conditions. We don't need any motivation -- the motivation is needy people. We rest between disasters. For more information, visit the ShelterBox website at www.shelterbox.org.","ShelterBox, a disaster relief organization, responded quickly to the catastrophe in Japan .

"Riverside, California (CNN) -- Akiko Kosaka, a student from Japan attending the University of California at Riverside, had lost all hope for her family in Minamisanriku, the fishing village where more than half of the 17,000 residents are missing and feared dead in the aftermath of last week's tsunami. For three days, she scoured the Internet. She received one e-mail that her youngest sister, Yukako, 13, was likely safe in her middle school's shelter. But what about her parents, paternal grandparents and older sister, who all lived under the same roof? When the mayor was quoted in the media as saying he barely survived the tsunami, Kosaka thought the worst, because her father's pharmacy was located near the town hall. ""I didn't think they survived,"" Kosaka, 20, told CNN during a tearful interview Tuesday. ""I cried for three days -- Friday, Saturday, Sunday."" Then she received word Sunday night from a friend in Japan of the existence of a 45-second YouTube video showing her family home as the only one standing amid the rubble. The video highlighted her older sister holding a sign to a TV news crew saying in Japanese ""we are all safe."" Kosaka expressed relief upon hearing of the video, but became distraught after she couldn't find it online, despite staying up all night looking for it. Then a contact through a Japanese social network e-mailed her the link Monday morning. When seeing the video for the first time inside the home of her host family, Kosaka's reaction surprised everyone in the household. ""I screamed, and my host parents woke up and they thought it was really bad,"" Kosaka said. ""They asked what happened. And I said, 'They survived!'"" In the video, her 24-year-old sister, Shoko, is standing on the family home's balcony, off Kosaka's bedroom, and is asking the TV crew to pass along word to her sister in America that she's safe. Now Kosaka is trying to respond by using the media and the Internet to inform her relatives she's aware of their message -- though she's still concerned about them in the obliterated coastal village, which media accounts liken to a ghost town. Kosaka has yet to see her father, Katsumi; mother, Noriko; or paternal grandparents on any video -- or receive any word from them. Though she speaks English, Kosaka extended a message to them, in Japanese, through a CNN news crew: ""My older sister, Shoko, I saw your video. Thank you very much for being alive. It made me really happy that you are worried about me even in this tough situation. ""Grandpa and grandma, how is your health? Dad and mom, I know that everything is tough right now with your job and everything but I am so glad that you are alive. I really look forward to seeing you guys again."" In the offices of the University of California at Riverside Extension program, where she began a year-long study of English last September, Kosaka provided a personal narrative to the stark footage of her hometown street now in ruins. Kosaka's family home is the only one left standing on a hill because her father reconstructed the two-story house with a basement five years ago, Kosaka said. The other houses in the neighborhood were aging, she said. Kosaka expressed shock that the earthquake or the tsunami demolished the block because she thought the area would be safe on high ground, she said. Her family's house has a scenic view of the ocean, just a five-minute walk away, she said. In the video, a news crew approaches the family house, and Kosaka's older sister is wearing a white helmet and holds up one sign saying, ""Kosaka Family,"" and then another saying, ""We are all safe."" At another point in the video, the older sister indicates she's holding up the signs to the camera crew ""because my younger sister is in America. We are all okay."" When Kosaka heard of the video's existence, she thought to herself, ""I couldn't believe it. It's a miracle,"" she said. Since seeing the video, she watched it over and over again -- at least ""50 or something"" times within about 24 hours, she said, offering a wild guess. As she reviewed the video again Tuesday morning, Kosaka was still incredulous. ""This is my house,"" she said, viewing the video on a university office computer. ""When I saw this video, I was very shocked by it. I thought (the hillside community) was safe. There were houses next to my house, but they were destroyed. That means the tsunami came up to the house."" She was moved to see her sister shouting to the news crew from the balcony. ""It makes me very happy,"" Kosaka said. ""It's the only way to hear her voice."" Her sister's voice, though, struck Kosaka as ""tired and depressed."" ""Maybe she tries to stay strong for my family. So I'm very proud of her,"" Kosaka said. She believes her parents are likely OK, but her grandfather, Yoshio, is 85 and grandmother, Soyoko, is 80. ""My grandparents are old, so I'm worried about their health,"" Kosaka said, adding no one in her hometown probably has water, and the winter weather is still cold, with snow. She's also worried about the family pharmacy, where her father, 52, is a pharmacist and her mother assists. The family opened it 10 years ago. ""I think it was his dream,"" Kosaka added. Since Kosaka saw the video, she has been sharing her story with classmates. ""I cried in front of them too much,"" she said Tuesday. The University of California at Riverside Extension is the continuing education branch of the university and has an enrollment of 4,000 students from 60 countries who participate in English-language study or certificate programs, said Bronwyn Jenkins-Deas, associate dean and head of international programs. Of the 4,000 students, 109 of them are from Japan, and five of them had families affected by the quake or tsunami or both, Jenkins-Deas said. It is only Kosaka, though, who has yet to have direct contact with her family, Jenkins-Deas said. ""The story is quite amazing,"" Jenkins-Deas added.","Akiko Kosaka, 20, is from the tsunami-wracked village of Minami Sanriku, Japan .

"(CNN) -- Halloween weekend appears to have scared off the major movie studios: none of them released a new film, perhaps figuring folks were more interested in parties and trick-or-treating. It seems they were right, as the holiday turned cineplexes into ghost towns. ""Nightcrawler,"" a dark thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal, was the only new movie to open in the top 10, taking in $10.9 million. Gyllenhaal plays a creepy freelance cameraman determined to ride the local TV news trend of ""if it bleeds, it leads"" to success. Weekend estimates showed ""Nightcrawler,"" from Open Road Films, barely edging last weekend's champ, the horror flick ""Ouija,"" Whichever film winds up on top, it'll be the lowest-grossing No. 1 movie since ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" topped the chart with just $10.4 million in early September in its sixth weekend in release. If ""Nightcrawler"" squeezes out the win, it'll be the lowest-grossing No. 1 debut in more than two years, when ""The Possession"" opened with just $9.3 million. Both of those low-grossing number ones occurred on the weekend after Labor Day, traditionally one of the poorest box office weekends of the year. This weekend's other new wide release, ""Before I Go To Sleep,"" opened outside the top 10, as expected. Nicole Kidman stars as a woman who wakes up every morning with her memory erased. That's an eerie similarity to Kidman's career of late, continuing a pattern of quickly-forgotten films: ""Trespass,"" ""The Paperboy"" ""Stoker,"" and ""The Railway Man."" Even a special Halloween re-release of the original ""Saw,"" the 2004 movie that helped spark the current horror-as-torture-porn genre, couldn't lure many fans. Jigsaw and his victims averaged a pathetic $315 per theater.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Two suspected ivory poachers were in custody and three others were killed by Kenyan authorities in the past week in a pair of incidents, the Kenya Wildlife Service said Monday. Five elephants also were killed in the incidents, the wildlife service said in a  statement. In the latest skirmish, a suspect was killed Sunday night while exchanging gunfire with wildlife rangers on the outskirts of Meru National Park in Isiolo County, the statement said. Another was arrested in the town of Isiolo. The rangers ambushed the suspects, who allegedly were using axes to hack off an elephant's tusks after shooting it to death, the wildlife service said. ""A major operation has been under way since dawn to arrest more suspects on the run,"" the statement said. ""They are believed to have sustained injuries from last night's shootout."" Authorities recovered two AK-47 rifles, 30 rounds of ammunition and 16.5 kilograms (36 pounds) of ivory after the incident in the Garbatulla District of Isiolo County, the wildlife service said. Four magazines also were recovered -- three for AK-47s and one for an M-16. A wildlife ranger was injured in the right shoulder during the exchange of gunfire. Abdi Gimbe, who is based at Meru National Park, was initially treated at a hospital but later was flown to Nairobi for treatment. Another poaching suspect was in custody in the town of Voi, near Tsavo East National Park, after an incident Tuesday, the wildlife service said. The suspect, arrested Saturday, was being questioned about the killings of four elephants in the Galana Ranch area and an illegal firearm found in his possession, authorities said. Two of the suspect's alleged accomplices were shot when exchanging fire with wildlife rangers and three others escaped, the wildlife service said. An AK-47 rifle was recovered. Authorities recovered two pieces of ivory buried in sand and five more pieces in the suspects' possession, the statement said. The suspect arrested Saturday had walked some 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the scene of the incident, and was found with a G3 rifle and three rounds of ammunition, the wildlife service said.","Suspects exchange fire with wildlife agents in two incidents .

"Washington (CNN) -- Eight current and former U.S. service members filed a lawsuit Tuesday alleging they were raped, sexually assaulted or harassed while serving in the military and were retaliated against once they reported the abuse. Among the defendants named in the suit are current and former Defense and Navy secretaries and Marine Corps commandants. ""Although defendants testified before Congress and elsewhere that they have 'zero tolerance' for rape and sexual assault, their conduct and the facts demonstrate the opposite: They have a high tolerance for sexual predators in their ranks, and 'zero tolerance' for those who report rape, sexual assault and harassment,"" according to the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington. The suit outlines a pattern of abuse and portrays, in grim detail, the alleged experiences of the eight female service members -- two former Marine Corps officers, one active duty enlisted Marine, one former enlisted member of the Marine Corps and four former enlisted members of the Navy. ""At first it was easy to laugh it off,"" plaintiff Elle Helmer, one of the former officers, said about her superiors' advances. ""When you finally said, you know, I'm really not interested, I'd rather we be friends -- that's when you became the target. They hated you for standing up for yourself,"" she told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Tuesday night. The lawsuit alleges Helmer was raped by her superior at his office in March 2006 after a required pub crawl. She told reporters at the National Press Club in Washington earlier in the day that she hoped by going public other victims would be encouraged to speak out. ""It's the first time I've had a voice in six years, so pardon if it's a little wobbly,"" said Helmer. She was joined by Ariana Klay, another former Marine Corps officer and plaintiff, who served in Iraq in 2008 and 2009. Opinion: Victims of military sex assaults deserve justice . In August 2010, Klay was ""gang-raped"" by a senior officer and his civilian friend at her Washington home, the suit contends. The officer allegedly threatened to kill Klay. She reported the rapes and the officer was eventually convicted in a military court of adultery and indecent language, and given 45 days in military confinement, Klay said. ""Their stance was there were two that said it (sex) was consensual, despite the death threat. That's two against one. So by that logic, the more people you're gang-raped by the less your case is,"" she told Velez-Mitchell. The Marine Corps responded to Klay and Helmer's allegations in a written statement Tuesday that said their respective cases had been properly investigated and handled. ""Federal law and judicial rulings require commanders in all services, including the Marine Corps, to balance needs of alleged victims with the constitutional rights of service members accused of crimes,"" it read. According to the most recent Defense Department study, more than 19,000 incidents of unwanted sexual contact are estimated to have occurred in 2010, though less than 3,000 of those events were reported. In 2010, less than 21% of reported cases went to trial. Of the 529 alleged perpetrators who were prosecuted, 53% were convicted, according to the 2011 Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, which is part of the Defense Department. ""As leaders of this department we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure the safety, dignity and well being of our people. One sexual assault is one too many,"" Defense Department spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in response to the lawsuit. As a result of the pending litigation, she was unable to comment directly on the allegations. ""Because sexual assault cases are some of the toughest cases to investigate and prosecute, the department has increased funding for investigators and judge advocates to receive specialized training,"" said Smith. The lawsuit was filed less than two months after Defense Secretary Leon Panetta outlined new measures targeting sexual assaults against U.S military personnel. In January, he promised increased funding to train military investigators and judge advocates about sexual assault cases, stressing the military has a ""zero tolerance policy"" for such crimes. ""Our men and women in uniform put their lives on the line every day to try to keep America safe,"" Panetta said then. ""We have a moral duty to keep them safe from those who would attack their dignity and their honor.""","Among the defendants are current and former Defense and Navy secretaries .

"(CNN) -- For many families, the school year just started, but for Karen Suffern, it's not too early to start planning for Christmas. The financially struggling single mother of fraternal twins recently asked her 8-year-olds to write down a list of things they would like from Santa. Suffern, who works part time as an administrative assistant for a home health care company, wanted to start budgeting for the holidays. She knew her twins, who just began third grade, were at the age where they would start asking for electronics and other expensive gifts. Her son, Ryan's, letter to Santa started off normally: . ""Dear Santa ... I wanted a (remote control) car and helicopter, but I don't want that anymor. Kid at school are still picking on Amber and its not fair,"" he wrote. ""I prayed that they will stop but god is bisy and needs your help."" Suffern felt tears fill her eyes as she read her son's letter asking Santa to help stop the bullying his overweight sister was experiencing at school. Reading the letter was tough for Suffern. ""I try to build up my daughter's self-esteem and tell her she is beautiful, but people say hurtful things to me, because I also have a weight problem, and that hurts me,"" she said. ""I can't imagine what she goes through."" She had a vague idea that Amber was teased on the bus, but she didn't know the extent of the bullying. Amber, who has attention-deficit (hyperactivity) disorder and other mental and mood disorders, never mentioned the teasing. Bully-proofing your kids . Suffern explains that Amber is an emotional eater and weighs 140 pounds, nearly twice the size of her brother, Ryan. The twins returned to school three weeks ago at Rocky Mount Preparatory in North Carolina. It's the first time Ryan and Amber have been in the same classes. Ryan would come up to Suffern to tell her in private about classmates bullying Amber -- how the kids in gym class would laugh at her when she could not do the bear crawl on the floor, tease her about her weight in class or tell her that she was adopted because she is multiracial. ""Every day when she goes to school, she says, 'Mommy, can I just stay at home?' and she just doesn't want to go.' And now every time I send her to school, I feel like I am not protecting her and I am letting her down,"" Suffern said. After reading her son's letter over the weekend, Suffern shared it online with friends, including Tony Posnanski's Facebook page, where he features stories of inspiration, weight loss and life advice. Posnanski says he was moved by Ryan's letter because it reminded him of his childhood. ""When I was a kid, I was bullied for a bit"" because of his weight, he explained. Posnanski posted the story to CNN iReport, where it quickly garnered thousands of page views. ""I wanted to do something to get (the story) out,"" Posnanki said, adding that bullying is a serious issue that deserves attention. A study released Monday in the journal Pediatrics says there is an association between being bullied and psychosomatic problems, meaning children who are bullied run the risk of higher mental problems that can cause them physical distress. Study authors Gianluca Gini and Tiziana Pozzoli write, ""Given that school bullying is a widespread phenomenon in many countries around the world, the present results indicate that bullying should be considered a significant international public health problem."" Others studies report that as many as one in four children is bullied. There have been several incidents of teens bullied to the point of committing suicide, most recently 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick, who jumped off a building because of cyberbullying. Suffern says Ryan's letter to Santa sheds new light on her daughter's situation, and she plans on speaking to Amber's teachers and the parents of the bullies at school. ""If my kids don't call names and pick on others, I would expect other parents to teach their kids to be respectful, too,"" she said. ""There have been times my kids would point at others and say, 'why is her hair so strange' and things like that, and I would say, 'You know, people are different, and that is just the way they are.' "" She says it's important to realize that bullying comes in all sorts of forms. ""I understand that sometimes schools try to do as much as they can, but bullying doesn't have to physical; name-calling and putting someone down are considered bullying to me."" And Suffern says she is glad to have a selfless son like Ryan -- plus Santa -- watching out for Amber, too. Father, son lose 260 pounds after weight loss surgery . Update: Rocky Mount Prep Charter School posted a statement on its website Monday. It reads in part: . ""We are hyper-vigilant at Rocky Mount Prep to prevent, intervene and protect our scholars from instances such as this. Our teachers and staff have received training to recognize and address these types of behaviors, and we are proud of the way they respond. We are saddened that this has taken place within our school family, and we can assure all of our parents, scholars and community that we will continue to do everything possible to provide them with a positive and safe learning environment.""","8-year-old Ryan wrote a letter to Santa after seeing his sister being bullied at school .

"(CNN) -- A strong earthquake with magnitude 6.5 struck Friday night in the ocean southwest of Sumatra in Indonesia, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus gave voice Wednesday to the mistrust between his party and President Barack Obama after the President said he was ""not going to just wait"" on Republicans to pass comprehensive immigration reform. ""I don't believe a thing he says,"" Priebus said Wednesday, when asked by CNN's Erin Burnett about working with the president. ""All he's been doing for the last year is lying to Hispanic voters across the country."" While both parties said Wednesday that they hoped to find common ground, they also signaled imminent conflict. Obama made it clear that he was still planning to pursue executive action on immigration reform this year. The expected next Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday laying out their agenda for the next two years -- which includes repealing Obama's signature health care law. And Priebus also questioned why Republicans should compromise with Obama. ""After the American people repudiated the policies of Barack Obama and everyone that was connected to him, to now say 'Well, what are you guys going to do to compromise with the person the American people had just repudiated?' I think it's a little bizarre,"" Priebus said. In an editorial entitled ""Now we can get Congress going,"" Boehner and McConnell spent most of their ink touting their legislative agenda and the chance to pass bills that Majority Leader Harry Reid has kept off the Senate floor. The Republican leaders pledged to pass legislation to repeal Obamacare and authorize the Keystone pipeline -- both measures Democrats have ardently opposed. Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson fired back in an email Thursday accusing McConnell of ""letting Senator [Ted] Cruz set the agenda"" by vowing to repeal Obamacare and pointed out that the word ""compromise"" was ""conspicuously absent from Senator McConnell's vision for the next Congress."" And after slamming Democrats for keeping bills from getting a vote, the pair signaled that Republican control of Congress will herald a new era of more inclusive governance. ""We will restore an era in which committees in both the House and Senate conduct meaningful oversight of federal agencies and develop and debate legislation; and where members of the minority party in both chambers are given the opportunity to participate in the process of governing,"" McConnell and Boehner wrote. The top two Republicans in Congress also left a key item off their agenda in the editorial: immigration reform. The two sides continued to butt heads over the issue on Wednesday. McConnell said during a press conference Wednesday that executive action from Obama would be a ""mistake"" and would ""poison the well."" McConnell also said there ""certainly are going to be areas of disagreement"" and said Obama ""has really got a choice."" That choice should be to ""give the new Congress a chance"" on immigration reform, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is considered by many to be the linchpin of any comprehensive deal on immigration. ""'At the end of the day the Republican Party would benefit from getting immigration reform off the table,"" Graham said Wednesday on CNN.

"(CNN) -- A Kenyan chief in a town far from the bustling capital foiled a predawn robbery recently using Twitter, highlighting the far-reaching effects of social media in areas that don't have access to the Internet. Chief Francis Kariuki said he got a call in the dead of the night that thieves had broken into a neighbor's house. He turned to Twitter, which allows users to send messages in 140 characters or less, to reach his community instantly. ""Thieves in Kelven's living room, let's help him out please,"" he tweeted in Swahili, the local language. Local residents, who subscribe to his tweets through a free text messaging service, jumped into action. They surrounded the house, sending the thugs fleeing into the night. He later sent a message thanking the community in his town of Lanet Umoja for coming out. While Twitter has been associated with bolstering uprisings and anti-government protests in Africa, its use is expanding in the continent, with communities in remote areas tailoring the global service and making it work for local audiences. In the town 100 miles from Nairobi, a majority of residents don't have access to computers, the Internet or smart phones. The sporadic cyber cafes strewn across the landscape charge for Internet access. However, almost every household has a cell phone and text messages are a major form of communication in the nation. ""Every time we have barazas (meetings) twice a month, I make attendees subscribe to my tweets using their regular SMS or text messaging services,"" Kariuki said by phone from the town. ""It has not only saved on the cost of fliers, it has also allowed us to save trees and contribute to green efforts."" Subscribers get his tweets in real time in the form of free text messages, and don't need to have a Twitter account or an Internet connection to receive them. The chief can send them any time using his smart phone. ""It's all about empowering the local person on the ground with information,"" Kariuki said by phone. ""Before I decided on this, I asked around -- how can I reach all my people in one time at no cost to them?"" Kariuki leads a community of 28,000 residents and while his Twitter account shows he has about 400 followers -- or people who get his tweets online -- the chief said those who receive his tweets via text message are in the thousands. ""They just don't register as followers because they don't have Twitter accounts,"" he said. ""A lot of people in town get the text tweets, even the thieves and police."" The chief's use of social media allows him to reach everyone at the same time, and residents say the effort is paying off. ""He has really helped us know what's going on around us. Now we know to expect a message from the chief any time, so we don't turn off our phones at night,"" said Jane Wangari, who lives in the town. In addition to rallying the community, the chief also uses social media to share doses of encouragement and send out alerts about missing animals. ""There's a donkey that's been tied under a tree for days, we don't know its owner, help please,"" he tweeted recently after a message about a missing sheep that was later found. A recent study shows social media use in the continent is growing, with South Africa sending the most tweets, followed by Kenya and Nigeria. Egypt and Morocco follow in the list of top five most active countries. The report this month by Portland Communications and the trend-analysis group Tweetminster based its conclusion on a three-month study of tweets from the continent. About 57% of tweets from Africa are sent from mobile devices, according to the study. ""We saw the pivotal role of Twitter in the events in North Africa last year, but it is clear that Africa's Twitter revolution is really just beginning,"" Beatrice Karanja, head of Portland Nairobi, said in a statement. ""Twitter is helping Africa and Africans to connect in new ways and swap information and views. And for Africa -- as for the rest of the world -- that can only be good."" During the study, South Africa -- the leading country in the study -- sent about 5 million tweets, nearly twice as many as second-place Kenya.","The chief sends out tweets, which residents get in the form of a text message .

"(CNN) -- A shooter opened fire at a New Jersey mall late Monday, sending panic through the shopping center and igniting a massive police response. The gunman inside Westfield Garden State Plaza Mall in Paramus, New Jersey, had not yet been found during a sweep of the shopping center by Bergen County SWAT, said county Chief of Staff Jeanne Baratta. But authorities have identified a possible suspect, New Jersey State Police Sgt. Joe Lettieri said. Authorities swept through the mall store-by-store late into the night. Mayor Rich LaBarbiera said there have been no injuries, and authorities believe the gunman is no longer in the mall. At least one gunman is said to have fired shots at security cameras, the state police said. A single shell casing has been found, a Bergen County emergency management official said. Eddie Kahmann, who works inside the mall, told CNN he heard 6 or 7 gunshots around 9:20 p.m. ET. ""There was just people running like crazy, so I quickly just closed my doors, ran to the back, turned off all the lights, music and everything, just to stay hidden,"" he said. Kahmann spoke from inside the mall, one of the largest shopping centers in the New York City area. Allie Cozic, another mall employee, said she saw ""someone dressed in all black, carrying a large gun, walk past our store."" She said she heard loud bangs about 10 minutes before her store was set to close for the night. ""It was just chaos. Everyone was just kind of running to wherever they could,"" Cozic said. ""It was almost like when you're watching a horror movie and the killer is walking slowly -- that's what it seemed like. He was wearing all black, it almost looked like body armor of some kind. As soon as I saw the gun, I just turned and ran,"" she said. There is a large police presence at the mall, which was set to close at 9:30 p.m. ET. There are about 20 vehicles both marked and unmarked. The FBI, including an FBI SWAT team, was also on the scene. ""There is a massive response from several agencies,"" according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. Police were putting on flak jackets and bringing out assault weapons. People were pushed away from the mall and were telling CNN that they've been told the shopping center was on lockdown. Westfield Garden State Plaza is located some 12 miles from Manhattan. It boasts of being home to nearly 300 specialty shops and boutiques.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Kuwait's prime minister will be making a trip to Iraq soon, to discuss bilateral ties and debt issues among other things. Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammed al-Ahmed al-Sabah will visit Iraq soon. Kuwait Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammed al-Ahmed al-Sabah will visit Baghdad, according to the Iraqi government and Kuwait's state-run news agency. Al-Sabah's trip would be the latest high-level visit to Iraq by a top Arab official, and it comes as Iraq works to cement ties with its immediate neighbors and the Arab world in general. Some Arab countries have agreed to reopen their embassies in Baghdad. King Abdullah II of Jordan last month became the first Arab head of state to visit Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. The Iraqi government said Finance Minister Bayan Jabr arrived Sunday in Kuwait heading a delegation to discuss bilateral ties, including the war reparations Iraq is paying Kuwait for its 1990 invasion of the Arab state. Kuwait's news agency, KUNA, on Monday reported Jabr delivered an official invitation from Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to his Kuwaiti counterpart inviting him to visit Iraq. KUNA said al-Sabah accepted the invitation and said the date of the visit will be set through diplomatic channels. An aide to al-Maliki told CNN he had heard that the visit was scheduled for next week but wasn't aware of reports that it had been postponed till after the holy month of Ramadan ends in about three weeks. Iraq has been asking Gulf states to waive debts from the Saddam Hussein era. Recently, the United Arab Emirates canceled about $7 billion owed by Iraq. Iraq wants to lower the amount of money it has to pay into a U.N. compensation fund for people who suffered losses from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. A car bombing in northern Baghdad killed at least two policemen and wounded five people Monday evening, Iraq's Interior Ministry told CNN. The bomb detonated in a parked car in central Baiji -- about 125 miles (200 km) north of Baghdad -- and was believed to be targeting a police patrol, the ministry said. Among the five wounded were two other policemen. It was one of several attacks across Baghdad on Monday, the Interior Ministry said. In all, eight people were killed and more than three dozen wounded in the attacks. Earlier in the day, a civilian was shot dead in central Baghdad when security personnel in an Iraqi government convoy opened fire after hearing shots, Iraq's Interior Ministry said. Six civilians were wounded. A roadside bomb killed a civilian and wounded 11 people on eastern Baghdad's Palestine Street, the ministry said. Later, another bomb wounded two police officers and three civilians in a police convoy on Palestine Street. Another roadside bomb killed one police officer and wounded another officer and a civilian in central Baghdad, it said. Gunmen wounded at least three government employees and their driver in eastern Baghdad, the ministry said. In the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, a policeman was killed and four civilians were wounded in a car bombing. In Diyala province, two Iraqi soldiers were killed and four were wounded when a roadside bomb struck their convoy south of Baquba, and attackers kidnapped an Awakening Council leader near Muqdadiya. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","NEW: Death toll rises to six as bomb kills two Iraqi soldiers in Diyala province .

"(CNN) -- Montana's governor declared a state of emergency Tuesday related to a ruptured pipeline that caused tens of thousands of gallons of oil to gush into the Yellowstone River -- a break the pipeline's owner still doesn't know the cause of, a spokesman said. The declaration applies to Yellowstone, Treasure, Rosebud, Custer, Prairie, Dawson and Richland counties, all of which have been affected by the spill just before midnight Friday. ExxonMobil has reported 750 to 1,000 barrels (32,000 to 42,000 gallons) of oil escaped into river in Laurel, about 16 miles southwest of Billings. The longest undammed river in the United States, the Yellowstone eventually leads into the Missouri River, one of the biggest in the United States. Gary Pruessing, the president of the ExxonMobil Pipeline Company, told reporters Tuesday that oil had been confirmed 25 miles away, with most such pockets within 19 miles of the leak site. But in the emergency declaration, which paves the way for emergency funds for the seven counties, Gov. Brian Schweitzer claimed oil has since been discovered beyond Hysham, about 90 miles from the leak site. The Democratic governor stated in the same executive order that the ""ExxonMobil Pipeline Company (is) the responsible party for this release."" ExxonMobil has seen ""measureable progress,"" said Pruessing, as it has stepped up its cleanup effort -- one that's come under criticism from Schweitzer. The Texas-based firm has committed 350 people to  the spill response, up from the roughly 280 people working to mitigate the fallout as of Monday night. Of those, between 150 to 200 people are actually on the ground, cleaning up and looking for oil, said Pruessing. ""We're going to keep adding resources,"" ExxonMobil Alan Jeffers told CNN on Tuesday.  ""That's our focus -- find the oil, clean it up and get it back to its original state as quickly as possible."" Schweitzer toured the spill site Tuesday morning, one day after criticizing the speed and effectiveness of the response in an interview with CNN. Later that day, Pruessing of ExxonMobil said, ""We do not yet have a resolution, as to what caused the incident."" The current continued to move swiftly Tuesday down the Yellowstone, carrying with it all sorts of debris, like a tree 30 inches in diameter that Schweitzer spotted. While no official determination has been made on what caused the pipeline rupture, the governor said it is easy to see the dangers posed by fast-moving waters. Any pipelines built now, Schweitzer noted, must be buried deeper under the riverbed in order to prevent such incidents. The company said it shut down the line within minutes after the break, but not before toxins had been dumped in the water. Schweitzer told PBS on Tuesday that a pressure drop tipped pipeline operators in Houston, Texas -- more than 1,300 miles from the rupture site -- seven minutes after the rupture occurred, with the shutdown complete within 30 minutes. Lloyd Webber, a Laurel rancher, said the spill left a ""pretty heavy"" smell of oil hanging over the area. The governor noted that roughly one year ago, several state, county and local agencies held a ""mock pipeline spill"" drill on the Yellowstone River.  Many of those organizations, including the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department, the state Environmental Quality Department and various Yellowstone County officials, are involved in the current effort in the southern part of the state. Historically high water levels and rapid currents have made things difficult for those trying to clean up the spill.  On Saturday, levels near Billings reached their peak for the season at 13.95 feet, nearly a foot above flood stage, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. ""The river level is actually up again, far exceeding its banks,"" Jeffers told CNN Tuesday.  ""It's just not safe"" for crews to go into the river itself. Duane Winslow, Yellowstone County's emergency services director, said over the weekend that crews have been forced to work from onshore for fear of being swept up in the water. Exxon said Monday it has eight boats ready to go should conditions improve. In terms of evacuations, flooding has -- and continues to -- affect more people in the region, thanks largely to the residual effects from the melting of massive winter snowpacks.  About 200 residents were ordered out Friday night, and then allowed back in the next morning.  That's significantly less than the hundreds who have been forced from their homes because of the persistent, far-reaching flooding in the area. ""We haven't seen a lot of issues around here (due to the spill),"" said Nathan Hammond, who works at the Yellowstone River Campgrounds in Billings. ""But there has been a lot of flooding, that has been a big issue."" Still, ExxonMobil reported in a statement that it had received 94 calls to its community claims line as of Monday night -- 36 of those coming from landowners reporting oil had washed up on their property. The governor called it premature to minimize the spill's potential impact by saying, for instance, that it has only affected 10 miles of the river.  His fear is that the abundance of fish, birds and animals in the area, which is about 100 miles downstream from Yellowstone National Park, may be hurt in the short and long term. ""My biggest concern is those 1,000 barrels,"" Schweitzer said. ""You cannot dump (that much oil) into a pristine trout stream without causing damage to the fisheries."" Besides the fish, the area is home to Canada geese, ducks, ospreys, otters and bald eagles, said Charles Preston, an ecologist and conservation biologist who heads the Draper Museum of Natural History.  The birds, in particular, might die directly or indirectly as they go after fish. Long term, and depending on factors like the quantity and nature of the leaked oil, toxins may kill critical insects, which in turn could have a trickle-down effect on the multimillion-dollar fishing industry, he said. ""It could take years to really understand the impact of the spill,"" Preston said. The Yellowstone is the nation's longest river without a dam -- a plus for the spill cleanup efforts because the continuously running water more easily breaks up the toxins, but a negative because any ill effects could spread into the Missouri River and its other tributaries, Preston said. More than 48,000 feet of absorbent boom and 2,300 absorbent pads had been used as of Tuesday to soak up the oil, while ""vacuum trucks"" and tankers have been positioned nearby to transport them from the scene, according to ExxonMobil. The company said the air quality and municipal water systems are also being monitored, while planes are routinely flying over the river to help detect patches of oil. David Eglinton, an ExxonMobil spokesman, said the company is committed to staying the course and studying the effects through the whole course of the river. That includes checking water quality as far downstream as Miles City (144 miles) and Glendive (222 miles) from the original spill site. Pruessing said Tuesday that no dangerous levels of oil have been detected yet in the air or ground water, even as he committed to continued checks for the foreseeable future. ""We have not put ... any estimates about what this will cost, that's not our primary focus right now,"" said Pruessing. ""We are going to be here until the job is done."" Schweitzer, too, promised that the state government agencies likewise wouldn't rest until the cleanup is complete and all related issues -- including the cost of the effort, a tab he said should go to the oil companies -- are resolved. ""Everybody in Montana will work hard until this is done,"" the governor said. ""We'll be on it like a stink on a skunk.""

"Boston (CNN) -- Rebuffing his lawyers' request, a federal judge has set the trial date for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for November 3. The date was set during a status hearing in Boston federal court Wednesday. On Monday, Tsarnaev's lawyers had filed a report requesting that the trial start no earlier than September 2015. Tsarnaev's lawyers said they had not had a chance to review the many pieces of physical evidence, ""including nearly 2,000 items that reportedly are still being analyzed by the FBI and items kept at additional locations."" They were unable to sway Judge George O'Toole. ""I think this is a realistic and fair date,"" he said Wednesday. Judy Clarke,Tsarnaev's lead attorney, said ""meeting the trial date will be impossible."" Prosecutors to seek death penalty . Prosecutors said they estimate the trial would last approximately 12 weeks. If Tsarnaev is found guilty, prosecutors expect the sentencing hearing would last approximately six weeks. Jurors will not only weigh whether he's guilty but also whether he deserves to die. Federal prosecutors said last month they'll seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev, arguing that he acted in ""an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner"" and lacks remorse. Tsarnaev is charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the April 15 attack, which left three people dead and more than 250 others injured. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Authorities allege Tsarnaev, a Chechnya-born American, and his brother, Tamerlan, planted two homemade bombs near the finish line of the marathon, then killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later.

"(CNN) -- A 6.4-magnitude earthquake rocked southern Taiwan on Thursday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There were no immediate reports of deaths or serious injuries. Taiwan's interior ministry reported 11 minor injuries. The quake struck at about 8:20 a.m. (7:20 p.m. Wednesday ET) in a mountainous region about 25 miles northwest of Taitung, on the southeast coast, and 40 miles east of Tainan and Kaohsiung on the southwest coast. Were you there? Did you feel it? The region, which includes Taiwan's Maolin National Scenic Area, is recovering from a direct hit by Typhoon Morakot that killed hundreds in August. The typhoon dumped more than two feet of rain, causing serious mudslides in the south, including one that buried the village of Shiao Lin under 50 feet of mud. Shuo Hong, an orthopedic surgeon in Taipei, about 155 miles away from the epicenter, felt the earthquake during a meeting at a hospital. ""We were debating whether or not to run for shelter,"" he said, ""but the hospital is safe. It is built to resist a 7.0-magnitude earthquake. ""It was shaking for about 20-30 seconds, shaking more than what we expected,"" Hong said. Thursday's quake was followed by more than a dozen aftershocks, the largest reaching 4.8. The initial 6.4 quake rumbled to the surface from 14 miles deep. The Taiwan Ministry of Interior and the National Fire Agency said electricity was cut off in parts of Kaohsiung county, Jia Yi city and Jia Yi county. Taiwan's official news agency reported that a fire broke out in Jia Yi city. Of the minor injuries reported, the interior ministry said that nine were in Kaohsiung county and two were in Jia Yi county. Residents in southern Taiwan reported cracks in some buildings and major bridges. Train service was also disrupted in some areas, Taiwanese media reported. Two small hotels near the epicenter that were contacted by CNN reported no damage, though the buildings shook for a few seconds during the quake. Albert Yu, communications manager of the humanitarian organization World Vision, told CNN he was about halfway through a 90-minute trip via high-speed train from Taipei to Tainan when the quake struck. Passengers did not feel the quake, he said, but operators stopped the train and announced what had happened. More than an hour later, the train had not resumed service. ""The operator is examining the train and the tracks,"" he said, adding that there was concern about the stability of the area, particularly after the typhoon. ""Inside the train, people are calm and are waiting it out -- opening laptops, starting to work and chatting with people around them."" Yu said World Vision ""has already been on high alert responding to the quakes in Haiti and Chile, so we're closely monitoring reports in the earthquake in southern Taiwan."" Residents in the capital Taipei, 155 miles to the north, also felt the shaking. Earthquakes are not uncommon in the 13,892-square-mile island -- about the size of the U.S. states of Maryland and Delaware combined -- which sits across the juncture of the Eurasian and Philippine tectonic plates. A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck the same general region in December. The island took a double hit on December 26, 2006, when earthquakes of 7.1 and 6.9 magnitude hit eight minutes apart. The largest recorded quake to strike Taiwan was an 8.0-magnitude quake in 1920, but the worst earthquake disaster stemmed from a 7.1-magnitude quake in 1935 that killed more than 3,200 people -- followed by a 6.5-magnitude quake that killed more than 2,700 people three months later. More recently, a 7.6 magnitude-earthquake killed more than 2,400 people in 1999.

"(CNN) -- It seems the 2012 election cycle learned tricks employed by criminals and dictators. NBC reported last summer that an anonymous shell company made a $1 million donation to Restore Our Future, a pro-Mitt Romney PAC. The company, which was incorporated this year in Delaware -- a state known for peddling corporate secrecy -- then quickly dissolved, leaving no trace of the person who controlled it. The negative publicity surrounding this news report led the anonymous donor to identify himself and the PAC to confirm it. But there is no reason to believe that this is the first or the last instance of campaign finance hiding behind the opacity of anonymous U.S. shell companies. Even more troubling, this example demonstrates just how easy it is to exploit U.S. laws and use anonymous companies to funnel money through the financial system. Individuals can legally disguise their identities and assets behind anonymous shell companies. Information about the beneficial, or ultimate, owner of a company is not required to be collected when a company forms. This enables people, including those on financial sanctions lists, to hide behind anonymous corporate vehicles and deposit illicit funds into American banks. Congress has worked hard to tighten laws to combat money laundering and tax evasion, but incorporation laws continue to allow the formation and operation of anonymous shell companies that fly under the radar, making it nearly impossible for law enforcement to do its job. The same loophole that allowed a donor to hide behind an anonymous shell company provides terrorists, corrupt foreign politicians and drug traffickers opportunity to squirrel dirty money into and through the U.S. financial system. Pariah regimes such as Iran have benefited from secrecy provided by American shell companies. A lengthy and expensive investigation by the Department of Justice uncovered a complex nesting of shell companies that allowed Iran to profit from New York's pricey real estate market. Viktor Bout, on trial in New York on terrorism charges, is also accused of setting up a global network of shell companies to disguise illicit activities. The Nicolas Cage movie ""Lord of War"" is loosely based on this Russian arms dealer, who authorities say provided weapons used to fuel conflicts throughout Africa, South America and the Middle East. After he was extradited to the U.S. last year, Attorney General Eric Holder said, ""Long considered one of the world's most prolific arms traffickers, Bout will appear in federal court in Manhattan to answer charges of conspiring to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to a terrorist organization for use in trying to kill Americans. To date, 12 American shell companies linked to Bout (PDF) have been identified -- incorporated in Texas, Florida and Delaware. Corrupt foreign politicians also take advantage of anonymous U.S. front companies to hide money they have stolen from their own countries. In Equatorial Guinea, the Obiang regime stashed millions of dollars in American banks while poverty in the country worsened. The president's son, despite a monthly salary of less than $7,000, used wire transfers and American shell companies to funnel more than $100 million through U.S. banks -- funds that allowed him to purchase (PDF) a $35 million mansion in Malibu and a $33 million private jet. There is a simple solution that would prevent these crimes. If states collected information about the real people who own or control a company when it is formed, it would be much harder for criminals to hide their identities in order to launder illicit funds into the financial system. In August, Sens. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced a bill that would close this loophole. The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act (PDF) would require states to maintain a registry of the beneficial owners of each corporation and LLC formed according to its laws. This is an easy change. States would need only to add a question inquiring about the ultimate owner of the company to incorporation forms they already use. Multiple law enforcement agencies have endorsed the bill, which would give them access to this information. Setting a standard for collecting information about the true owner of a company would level the playing field between the states while preventing terrorists, drug traffickers and kleptocrats from hiding behind corporate secrecy. It would also strengthen our homeland security, make it harder for corrupt politicians to steal money that should be used to eliminate poverty and reduce the ability of Americans and foreigners alike to anonymously donate large sums of money to political campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stefanie Ostfeld.","Stefanie Ostfeld: Owners of shell companies can donate to politicans anonymously .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Paris Hilton left Japan late Wednesday afternoon after initially being refused entry because of a drug conviction, immigration officials said. The American socialite was heading back to the United States ""after a lengthy delay at Japanese immigration,"" her spokesman said Wednesday. ""Paris is very disappointed and fought hard to keep her business commitments and see her fans, but she is forced to postpone her commitments in Asia,"" the spokesman said. She arrived in Japan on Tuesday and had been allowed to spend the night, to see whether immigration officials would reconsider their initial refusal to allow her entry. Hilton left about 4 p.m. Wednesday, before they reached a final verdict, said an immigration official at Narita Airport. Hilton pleaded guilty to a drug charge earlier in the week in Las Vegas, Nevada. Japan generally denies entry to foreigners who are on probation. Hilton had traveled to Japan because of ""business obligations planned many months earlier,"" her spokesman said. ""Paris understands and respects the rules and laws of the immigration authorities in Japan and fully wishes to cooperate with them,"" the spokesman said. ""Paris looks forward to returning in the future to a country she loves and has been coming to for the past 10 years."" On Monday, Hilton entered guilty pleas to misdemeanor charges of drug possession and obstruction of an officer, but a felony cocaine possession charge was dropped. She was sentenced to a year of probation, a $2,000 fine and 200 hours of community service. She was arrested on the Las Vegas Strip last month after she and her boyfriend were stopped by a motorcycle officer who smelled marijuana coming from their vehicle. Hilton admitted in court Tuesday that a small amount of cocaine found in her pocketbook was hers.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Fighting continued Monday as rival Libyan militias battled for Tripoli International Airport and the interim government said it was considering asking for international military help. In a statement aired on a private Libyan television channel, one of the three main Zintan groups in Tripoli said that at least two members of the force defending positions at the airport were killed in a rocket attack. Al-Qaaqaa brigade said at least three other people were wounded. A photo posted on several Zintan Facebook pages showed a makeshift clinic set up inside the airport's main terminal. CNN could not independently verify when the image was taken. The government in a written statement said early Tuesday that it discussed at an emergency session ""a potential request for international forces to solidify the state's capabilities"" at an emergency session. While Libyan officials have called for calm, the government is weak and militias outnumber and outgun its security forces. Many of the armed groups are on the state's payroll. These circumstances make it very difficult for the government to gain control over this latest increasingly volatile and violent situation. Still the government on Tuesday called for an immediate halt to the fighting and for the militias to withdraw within a week at least 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the airport. It said any commander that orders attacks on civilian facilities, including the airport, will face charges of murder. A resident who lives near the airport told CNN families in the area are fearful they will be killed or injured by what appears to them as indiscriminate shelling. The Libyan government statement said peacekeepers might give it a chance to build a suitable army and police force. More rocket attacks . Local media reported earlier Monday that rockets had hit the airport. A CNN crew could hear sporadic gunfire and explosions in the direction of the airport. The government said the customs building, maintenance building and some national security department planes had been destroyed. It also said 90% of the airliners parked there had been damaged as had the control tower. The damage to the planes, many of which belong to the two national airlines, is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the government said. The United Nations announced that it had evacuated its staff. ""This is a temporary measure,"" the United Nations said in a written statement. ""Staff will return as soon as security conditions permit. The United Nations, which stood by the Libyan people in their revolution in 2011, will not abandon them as they seek to build a democratic state."" It was the first time the U.N. staff in Tripoli had left since the revolution. The U.S. embassy updated its security message for Americans in the country, cautioning them to stay away from the airport, Airport Road and another nearby street. It said it could only provide limited emergency services to U.S. citizens. No air traffic . All flights in and out of the airport have been suspended. Brigades from the Zintan militia have controlled the airport since the Libyan civil war in 2011. Other militias have tried to wrest control of the airport from the Zintan brigades for years. Armed vehicles gathered in the area overnight before fighting broke out around dawn Sunday, witnesses said. Nine people were killed that day and 25 others wounded, the government said. Tensions remain . Even though Libyans successfully toppled the 42-year rule of Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, the country is far from stable. Armed militias are now the biggest challenge. The international community has largely agreed that the key to resolving Libya's crisis is national dialogue. But a weak central government -- combined with militias split along regional, tribal and ideological lines -- has added to the challenge. The U.S. State Department said this past weekend it was concerned the fighting could lead to widespread conflict and backed the new government. ""We affirm our support for Libya's democratic transition and urge the seating of the new Council of Representatives as soon as possible,"" the statement added. ""Finally, we stress the vital role Libya's Constitution Drafting Assembly plays in building the new country for which Libyans sacrificed so much during the revolution.""

"(CNN) -- All 24 hostages held captive by a hangun-toting student in northeast Wisconsin were freed Monday night, after several hours of being confined inside a high school classroom, police said. Marinette Police Chief Jeffrey Skorik told reporters just before 8:30 p.m. (9:30 p.m. ET) that the hostages -- 23 students and a female teacher -- were safe and would soon be reunited with their families. The chief did not immediately divulge the condition or whereabouts of the suspect, whose name has not been released. The young male took over the classroom about 3 p.m. Monday, as classes were ending at Marinette High School. He prevented anyone from  leaving the room and eventually communicated with police through a teacher, Skorik said. The chief announced shortly before 8 p.m. (9 p.m. ET) Monday that five hostages -- all students -- had been released. The hostage-taking student had no previous run-ins with the law, according to Skorik, adding that he had ""no idea"" about the suspect's motive. A Marinette school administrator called police at 3:48 p.m. (4:48 p.m. ET) Monday, after most students had left for the day, reporting that an armed student had gone into a classroom and taken those inside hostage. Bradley Behrendt, a city councilor, told CNN that he was two blocks from the school when about 15 police squad cars pull up and several officers come out, with their vests on and holding guns as they entered the school. ""They were just going like crazy,"" Behrendt said of the police response. By about 7 p.m., about 40 law enforcement personnel had converged on the scene, according to Skorik, with more coming in as the night went on. They included hostage negotiators who set up inside the school, according to Skorik. They had not talked directly with the student some three hours into the incident, but did get regular updates from the teacher. Skorik said that the hostage-taker is a student at Marinette High, and that he believed -- though he could not confirm -- the student was assigned to the class that he took over. Police know the identity of the student, though they haven't name him publicly, and have talked with his family members. Skorik said law enforcement believe the the young male, armed with a single handgun, acted alone. The incident riled residents of the Wisconsin city of about 11,600 residents, which borders Lake Michigan. Several  hundred people gathered about a  half-mile from the school, said Behrendt, but they were restricted by police from going any  closer. Prior to word of the hostages' release, law enforcement urged parents who didn't know where their children were to go to the Marinette County Courthouse, where they could see those on the affected class's roster, talk with police and get help from mental-health counselors. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: All 24 hostages are safe and free, after being held by an armed student .

"(CNN) -- FBI agents searched the home of veteran diplomat and Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin Raphel in October as part of a counterintelligence investigation, three U.S. government officials told CNN. As part of the investigation, Raphel's State Department office was searched and sealed, two of the officials said. It's unclear whether she is the target of the investigation, or what agents were searching for. The officials said it is an ongoing investigation and no charges have been filed. The investigation was first reported by The Washington Post. ""We are aware of this law enforcement matter. The State Department has been cooperating with our law enforcement colleagues,"" State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said. Psaki added that Raphel is ""no longer a department employee."" At the time of the raid, Raphel, a retired career Foreign Service officer, was an adviser on Pakistan under a limited, renewable contract to the State Department's Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, where she administered nonmilitary aid and economic grants. It is unclear, however, whether the inquiry is related to her work on Pakistan. Senior State Department officials said Raphel's security clearance was pulled last month, at which time she was placed on administrative leave. Her contract, which expired on November 2, was not renewed. The officials describe the investigation as a counterintelligence investigation, which typically refers to allegations of spying on behalf of foreign governments. Officials declined to describe the exact nature of the investigation. Raphel, the former assistant secretary of state for South Asia and ambassador to Tunisia, spent much of her career working on Pakistan and South Asia. Raphel was well-liked and respected by her colleagues and often outspoken about what she saw as flaws with U.S. policy toward Pakistan. Raphel's State Department biography says she began her career as a CIA analyst before serving 30 years in the Foreign Service. She retired from the State Department in 2005, but returned in 2009 to work as an adviser to the late Richard Holbrooke, appointed by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as the first special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. CNN attempted to contact Raphel, but messages have not been returned.","Pakistan expert Ambassador Robin Raphel was working for State Department .

"(CNN) -- Despite facing a punishing air bombing campaign, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria continues to march across Syria. This week, it tightened its siege on the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani. Though it is too soon to write off the American strategy to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" ISIS by relying on air power and Syrian rebels, the opening week was a box office flop. For the operation to be a success, Washington should enlist the support of a group it has spurned: the Syrian Kurds. To explain: ISIS is the most powerful fighting force across northern and eastern Syria. Its main Islamist competitors have all been weakened in recent months. The Salafi brigade Ahrar al-Sham has seen its stock plummet after Qatar curtailed its funding and its leader died. ISIS chased the al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra out of its eastern strongholds of Deir al-Zour. And the Tawhid Brigade has been adrift ever since the death of its leader last year. But Washington is not pinning its hopes on these politically unsavory groups to dislodge ISIS.  Instead, it has armed smaller and less powerful brigades from the loose umbrella organization known as the Free Syrian Army and has announced a program to train 5,000 rebels in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Equipping the Free Syrian Army got off to a rocky start. Sources in Turkey told me this summer that one brigade tried selling American-supplied TOW anti-tank missiles to Jabhat al-Nusra for $25,000 this year. Throwing money, arms and training at Free Syrian Army units will not defeat ISIS. Instead, it will require a fundamental shift in the Free Syrian Army's thinking. One of ISIS' chief strengths is its unit cohesion. Its cadres are ideologically bound, fighting for the cause of Islam. These doctrinal bonds ensure that units stick together when they come under fire. In contrast, Free Syrian Army brigades often battle for material gain and social status. In combat, their forces frequently disintegrate, no longer acting as a team. I witnessed this myself while spending time with them on the front in 2012 and 2013. There are also more mundane challenges. There are no rebel outfits that can confront ISIS in its Syrian bastion of Raqqa. In the summer of 2013, the city's strongest Free Syrian Army contingent, a loose alliance known as the 11th Brigade, mostly folded into Jabhat al-Nusra. When fighting erupted between ISIS and other organizations at the end of 2013, ISIS ejected Ahrar al-Sham from the town. Today, it reigns supreme in Raqqa. To lay siege to the city, Free Syrian Army groups would have to travel approximately 100 miles from their northwestern strongholds in Aleppo and Idlib. Logistical constraints -- these brigades rarely fight beyond their home regions -- would make resupplying forward units with ammunition, food and fuel unfeasible. And if Washington is hoping for a civilian uprising to topple ISIS in Raqqa, it might have to wait until the Armageddon jihadists are predicting will occur in Syria. The Western media have depicted ISIS-controlled areas as slave markets where a terrorized civilian population lives in constant fear. But there's evidence that many do not harbor such trepidation. Raqqans I spoke to via Skype and in Turkey said that many in the city support ISIS. And why would Syrians acquiesce to a group that seeks to control most facets of their lives? Because, as President Bill Clinton famously quipped, ""It's the economy, stupid."" In a war-torn country where civilians wait in line for hours to get bread, where they endure constant power outages and are hard-pressed to obtain fuel, Raqqans live on a paradise island of commodities. ISIS' oil fields provide gas, its dams deliver electricity, and its efficient bureaucracy ensures that groceries are stocked with sufficient supplies of basic staples. President Barack Obama may believe that ISIS ""is certainly not a state,"" but the Syrians under its control are grateful for its state services. Most important, the group ensures security in a country where there is none. The chaos and plunder that characterize Free Syrian Army-controlled areas are a distant nightmare. While the partially rebel-controlled city of Aleppo could be a stage set for a ""Mad Max"" sequel, ISIS' Raqqa is a field of dreams. The only other rebel-held areas that have a modicum of order are those under the control of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). The group rules the northern city of Qamishli and the villages surrounding it. Unlike Aleppo, the economy has not collapsed, and residents do not cut down trees for warmth. And in contrast to Raqqa, the secular Kurds have not driven out Qamishli's Christians but instead have protected them. Moreover, Turkish fears that a Kurdish enclave would provide a safe haven for Turkish Kurds from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) have proved unfounded. The Democratic Union Party  has ensured calm on the border, and a grateful Turkish government has reciprocated by meeting with its leaders. But the Kurdish Democratic Union Party's greatest asset is its willingness to fight ISIS. Long before Free Syrian Army brigades were willing to take on the jihadists, the Kurdish Democratic Union Party made the battle against them its chief objective. And while Free Syrian Army groups receiving arms from Washington, such as the Hazm Brigade and the 13th Division, have condemned the American airstrikes, the Kurdish Democratic Union Party has welcomed them. Yet despite this alignment of interests, Washington has shunned the group. It refuses to recognize the Kurdish Democratic Union Party or support it, because of its ties to the Kurdistan Workers Party, a State Department-designated terrorist organization since 1997. In a country where America has so few allies, a change in policy is warranted. Relying on insignificant Free Syrian Army units will not be enough to topple the ISIS behemoth. Working with the Kurdish Democratic Union Party could help Washington reach its objective of destroying the organization.","Barak Barfi: As airstrikes against ISIS fail, Washington should look to Syrian Kurds .

"Washington (CNN) -- There is no health risk from consuming milk with extremely low levels of radiation, like those found in Washington state and California, experts said Thursday, echoing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ""When we have a disaster like we've had with a nuclear power plant in Japan, we're probably going to find things that are truly not a public health risk, but I think it's very difficult for the public to assimilate this information and understand the risks,"" said Dr. Wally Curran, a radiation oncologist and head of Emory University's Winship Cancer Center. The federal agency said Wednesday it was increasing its nationwide monitoring of radiation in milk, precipitation, drinking water, and other outlets. It already tracks radiation in those potential exposure routes through an existing network of stations across the country. Results from screening samples of milk taken in the past week in Spokane, Washington, and in San Luis Obispo County, California, detected radioactive iodine, or iodine-131, at a level 5,000 times lower than the limit set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, officials said. At that level, a person would have to drink 1,000 liters of milk to receive the same amount of radiation as a chest X-ray, said Dr. James Cox, radiation oncologist at Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center. The I-131 isotope has a very short half-life of about eight days, the EPA said, so the level detected in milk and milk products is expected to drop relatively quickly. ""The good news about iodine is, it has a short half-life,"" said Curran. ""It doesn't dwell in any biologic system, be it an adult, a child, a cow, for any significant period of time, and at those levels there's no evidence that there's any medical significance."" Radiation gets into the milk because it falls on grass eaten by cows. The milk does not itself absorb radiation. FDA senior scientist Patricia Hansen also said the findings are ""minuscule"" compared to what people experience every day. Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire said tests confirmed the milk is safe to drink. ""This morning I spoke with the chief advisers for both the EPA and the FDA and they confirmed that these levels are minuscule and are far below levels of public health concern, including for infants and children,"" Gregoire said in a statement. ""According to them, a pint of milk at these levels would expose an individual to less radiation than would a five-hour airplane flight."" Similarly, the California Department of Public Health reassured residents that the levels do not pose a threat. ""When radioactive material is spread through the atmosphere, it drops to the ground and gets in the environment. When cows consume grass, hay, feed, and water, radioactivity will be processed and become part of the milk we drink. However, the amounts are so small they pose no threat to public health,"" the department said. At least 15 states have reported radioisotopes from Japan's crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in air or water or both. No states have recommended that residents take potassium iodide, a salt that protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine. Iodine-131 has been found in Eastern states from Florida to Massachusetts as well as in Western states like Oregon, Colorado, and California, according to sensors and officials in those states. None of the levels poses a risk to public health, they said. At high levels, the isotope focuses on and accumulates in a person's thyroid gland, Curran said. A medical test for thyroid health involves a person ingesting iodine-131 and undergoing a nuclear scan to examine the gland. The Japanese plant has been leaking radiation since it was damaged in a tsunami that followed a massive earthquake March 11. CNN's Sara Weisfeldt and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","Isotope won't remain in humans' or animals' digestive systems, expert says .

"(CNN) -- As 10 wildfires raged across California, authorities accused one man Thursday of having deliberately set one of the larger fires that was burning nearly uncontrollably over 111 square miles, officials said. Wayne Allen Huntsman, 37, faces one felony count of arson with a special allegation of a firefighter, peace officer or other emergency personnel having suffered great bodily injury in the so-called King Fire in northern California, according to the criminal complaint. Huntsman is being held on $10 million bail in El Dorado County Jail, said Sheriff John D'Agostini. The King Fire in Eldorado National Forest east of Sacramento exploded over a 24-hour period and nearly quadrupled to 73,184 acres Thursday from 18,544 acres a day earlier, authorities said. Evacuations were in effect for 2,819 people as the fire was only 10% contained, officials said. More than 12,000 residences are being threatened by the fire. Residents reported gargantuan flames. ""Anytime the wind could change. It's very unnerving to see this huge thing above where your home is, and so we are just down here to keep a close eye on things,"" Tara Rosas of the Pollock Pines community told CNN affiliate KCRA. Flames approach rangers . The fire even threatened a forest-ranger station near Pollock Pines, prompting rangers to turn their attention to defending their own quarters, said one off-duty firefighter who spoke with the foresters. The smoke lay so thick in the Sierra Nevada mountains that visibility was reduced to 200 feets, said Mike Forster of Oakland, an off-duty firefighter who was doing freelance photography. ""There is nothing but fuel and wilderness in front of it,"" Forster said of the fire. ""If you look at it on a map, it's heading toward Lake Tahoe, which could stop it, but there's nothing but fuel before it gets there,"" said Forster, who posted photos of the fire on his CNN iReport page. Lake Tahoe is about 50 miles away from the area to which Forster was referring. $5 million a day . In all, 6,600 firefighters were battling the state's 10 wildfires, and 150 arson investigators also were working, said Cal Fire Director Ken Pimlott. Fueling the fires is California's ongoing historic drought. On Thursday, Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state emergency in El Dorado and Siskiyou counties, where the King Fire and another wildfire burned wide swaths of land and destroyed homes. The King Fire was proving costly to fight, officials said. Exacerbating conditions were steep terrain, changing winds and the fire's speed, which made a run of more than 10 miles between Wednesday afternoon and Thursday's dawn. ""We are continuing to spend $5 million a day, and there is no estimate for containment for this fire,"" said Laurence Crabtree, Eldorado National Forest supervisor. ""This thing is just out of control at this point,"" said CNN international meteorologist Ivan Cabrera. The Boles Fire . Farther north, in Siskiyou County, near the border with Oregon, a smaller fire has already caused severe damage to property. The Boles Fire tore into the town of Weed this week, razing libraries, businesses and entire neighborhood blocks, according to CNN affiliate KDRV. The governor cited the damage by the Boles Fire in his emergency proclamation for the two counties. The blaze has destroyed at least 150 structures, according to Cal Fire, and crews are still assessing the scale of the damage. About 1,000 homes remain threatened, officials said. Images from the scene showed charred vehicles and patches of rubble where houses once stood. 'Devastating loss' That fire, which covers 375 acres, is now 65% contained, but evacuation orders remain in effect for some areas, Cal Fire said. Authorities say they want to allow people to return to their properties as soon as they can, but only when it's safe to do so. ""At some point we're going to have to remove this debris,"" local fire official Koby Johns told KDRV. ""And before that, we need to, one, make sure there's nobody here. And two, make sure there's nothing that's going to fall and injure a firefighter."" Announcing a state of emergency in El Dorado and Siskiyou, California Gov. Jerry Brown said, ""The wildfires in Northern California serve as a reminder that dry conditions can be the precursor to devastating loss."" Authorities have said California's ongoing historic drought has helped fuel fires that have plagued areas across the state. The causes of the King and Boles fires are still under investigation. Here's a summary of other wildfires, as of Friday: . -- The Happy Camp Complex in Siskiyou County's Klamath National Forest burned 130,139 acres and was 72% contained. -- The July Complex fire in Siskiyou County's Klamath National Forest and surrounding area charred 50,042 acres and was 98% contained. -- The Meadow Fire in Mariposa County's Yosemite National Park devastated 4,772 acres and was 90% contained. -- The Boles Fire in Siskiyou County's city of Weed burned 479 acres and was 95% contained. -- The Courtney Fire in Madera County burned 320 acres and was 90% contained, with 56 structures damaged or destroyed. -- The Irene Fire in Alpine County's El Dorado National Forest and Mokelumne Wilderness area burned 94 acres and was 45% contained. -- The June Fire in Mono County's Inyo National Forest scorched 65 acres and was 65% contained. -- The Silverado Fire in Orange County's Cleveland National Forest and Silverado Canyon area burned 968 acres and was 98% contained.

"Venice, Italy (CNN) -- George Clooney, the man long considered one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors, followed up his private wedding to British human rights attorney Amal Alamuddin with a civil ceremony in Venice, Italy, on Monday. Clooney, 53, and Alamuddin, 36, arrived at Venice's city hall -- the Ca' Farsetti palazzo -- in a water taxi appropriately named ""Amore,"" or ""Love."" Venetian authorities stopped pedestrian and boat traffic in the area for the ceremony. Clooney wore a gray suit and dark tie, while Alamuddin was dressed in flowing cream trousers, a cream top with a blue border and a wide-brimmed matching hat. The couple spent about 10 minutes inside the venue before boating to their hotel, with well-wishers lining the canal. Rai, Italian state television, later reported that they had left Venice on a private jet, heading for London -- leaving ""Amore"" free for other visitors to the city. Private ceremony . Celebrities, paparazzi and the world's media congregated in Venice for Clooney and Alamuddin's widely anticipated nuptials. Their private ceremony on Saturday was marked with a star-studded bash at the Aman Canal Grande Venice resort, housed in the 16th-century Palazzo Papadopoli. Clooney also arrived by motorboat to that ceremony, waving to the sound of ""George, auguri!"" as Venetians offered their best wishes. Plenty of paparazzi, cameramen and photographers were on the docks facing the Aman Canal Grande. Others were going up and down the Grand Canal on taxi boats. The first celebrity guests to arrive were also caught on camera in the city famed for romance, notably actor Matt Damon, American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and supermodel Cindy Crawford. ""I guess this is, as Dean Martin put it, 'That's Amore,' the land of love,"" said a tourist visiting Venice from Canada, referring to the late crooner's signature song. ""Yes, my heart is broken but I'm excited,"" his partner said with a smile. The actor and his then-fiancee were also photographed Friday cruising the sun-dappled canals of Venice ahead of their big day. Why Venice? Clooney revealed earlier this month at a celebrity charity event in Tuscany, Italy, that he and Alamuddin would be tying the knot in Venice. According to People magazine, Clooney was receiving a humanitarian award at the black-tie gala, and said during his acceptance speech, ""I met my lovely bride-to-be here in Italy, whom I will be marrying, in a couple of weeks, in Venice, of all places."" Since they became engaged in the spring, Clooney and Alamuddin have been largely protective of their relationship. When a Daily Mail report claimed that Clooney and his Lebanese future mother-in-law, Baria Alamuddin, were at odds, Clooney blasted the publication with a first-person piece in USA Today, and then refused to accept the Daily Mail's subsequent apology. Laura Smith-Spark reported from London and Erin McLaughlin and Livia Borghese reported from Venice for this article.","Actor George Clooney legally marries lawyer Amal Alamuddin in Venice .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of international visitors come to Nepal each year to explore the spectacular Himalayan Mountains, providing poor communities with millions of dollars that they desperately need. The perils of that endeavor revealed themselves in stark fashion Tuesday, when at least 17 people from around the world died after being trapped in heavy snowfall while trekking at high altitude. A dozen of the deaths were in the popular Annapurna region, Nepal army spokesman Niranjan Shrestha said, while another five were in the neighboring Manang district. Officials say more people are missing and it is feared the toll could rise. This is already one of the deadliest such tragedies in the history of Nepal, a nation of about 26 million known worldwide for its spectacular mountain ranges, including Mount Everest. The deaths -- said to be the result of two days of unusually heavy snow caused by Cyclone Hud-hud in eastern India -- come only six months after tragedy last struck on the slopes of Mount Everest. Then, a bruising avalanche of ice swept 16 Sherpas to their deaths. After the accident, which came right before the peak season in May, many Sherpas refused to climb and at least six companies that lead Everest expeditions called off their 2014 climbs. While only the fittest sign up for a mountaineering feat like climbing Everest, trekking through the dramatic Himalayan landscape -- while challenging -- is accessible to many more. Last year, 102,000 foreigners came to Nepal to take part in trekking and mountaineering, the vast majority of them trekkers. The Annapurna region is the most popular trekking area in the country and attracts many visitors every fall, the better of the two seasons -- the other being spring -- to join organized multiday hikes. Conditions in the Himalayas can be cruel. But trekkers dying in snowstorms is almost unheard of. Bodies buried under snow . The loss of lives Tuesday will affect many nations, and could dent confidence in an industry vital to Nepal's economic well-being. Of the 12 killed in the Annapurna region, only four bodies have so far been recovered, of two Poles, an Israeli and a Nepali. Eight more remain buried under the suffocating snow. Their nationalities are not known, said Shrestha, the army spokesman. It is unclear if any more are missing, he said. The trekkers died Tuesday evening near the iconic 5,416-meter (17,770-foot) Thorung La Pass in Mustang district, the highest point of the 21-day Annapurna Circuit trek, he said. ""Those who stayed back in lodges because of poor weather survived,"" he said. Two army helicopters on Wednesday rescued 38 more trekkers who were trapped in the unseasonably heavy snowfall, Shrestha said. Baburam Adhikari, the top government official in Mustang district, said 244 trekkers crossed the Thorung La Pass and came to the village of Muktinath on Monday and Tuesday. But there is no information on how many began the trek from the other side of the pass in Phedi. ""We do not know how many are missing, but there is a possibility that there are people missing,"" he said. Those who died seem to have lost their way in the snow. A rescue team found a group of German tourists at midnight Tuesday, he said. Search operations will continue Thursday. About 50 kilometers (31 miles) to the west, five people -- two Slovaks and three Nepalis -- are missing after an avalanche Tuesday night at the base of Mount Dhaulagiri, the world's seventh-highest mountain, police and a local outfitter said. Injured trekkers rescued . Meanwhile, five more trekkers -- four Canadians and an Indian -- died in remote Manang district Tuesday, and their bodies were found Wednesday, Manang district police official Narayan Datta Chapagain told CNN via phone. A Nepal army helicopter rescued three injured Canadians and their Nepali guide from Manang, Chapagain said, adding that he did not know about the condition of the injured. The details of the deaths of the four Canadians and one Indian are unclear, according to Chapagain, but he said they were caused by heavy snow. Nepal's government has said it aims to welcome some 2 million visitors annually by 2020, with tourism central to a sustainable national economy. It usually rakes in about $3 million from Everest climbers during the May high season. But most of the nearly 500 who had planned the ascent in 2014 abandoned their climbs, with only one Chinese woman making it to the summit. Journalist Manesh Shrestha wrote and reported from Kathmandu and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark from London.","NEW: Five people are missing after an avalanche near Mount Dhaulagiri, police say .

"(CNN) -- If you really wanna get a song stuck in your head, you gotta get with my friends the Spice Girls. The group's 1996 debut single ""Wannabe"" is the world's catchiest song, researchers in Holland say. The University of Amsterdam has partnered with Manchester's Museum of Science and Industry to study what makes music so memorable. They recently launched Hooked on Music, an online interactive game that asks people to identify songs as quickly as possible based on a short clip. Turns out people recognize ""Wannabe"" in an average of 2.29 seconds, according to the BBC. If you made the mistake of Googling the song just now, you know it's easy to get part of it stuck in your head, even if you don't particularly enjoy the music. Scientists call these self-repeating song loops ""ear worms."" But they don't know much yet about why they happen -- and how they're affecting your brain. Music: It's in your head, changing your brain . More than 20,000 people have played Hooked on Music, the Dutch researchers say. Results from the first batch of data collected will be released this weekend at the Manchester Science Festival. The scientists hope their research will lead to breakthroughs for dementia and Alzheimer's patients. ""There has already been some research that shows that if you can find the right piece of music, something that had a very strong meaning, playing that piece of music can be very therapeutic,"" computational musicologist John Ashley Burgoyne told the BBC. ""The challenge is figuring out what is the best piece of music."" The top 10 catchiest songs, according to the Hooked on Music experiment, are: . 1. Spice Girls, ""Wannabe"" 2.

Honkanen says was inspired by his previous career in professional racing (snowmobiles in winter, jet skis in summer) and his own experience of turning a whimsical idea into reality -- he opened a chocolate shop after watching the Johnny Depp/Juliette Binoche film ""Chocolat."" Despite its name, the package is more about the travel aspect than the film component, which is optional, says Honkanen. Fulfilling a fantasy doesn't come cheaply though.

"(CNN) -- A 24-year-old man was arrested Saturday in connection with a wildfire that destroyed more than 150 homes in Northern California, not far from the Oregon border. Weed police announced that Ronald Beau Marshall had been booked into the Siskiyou County Jail on a three felony arson charges, including one of an inhabited structure or property. Marshall's bail was set at $250,000, police said. It all stems from the Boles Fire, a relatively small blaze in terms of total acreage but a very large one when it comes to total destruction. The wildfire began September 15 and was put out five days later. Yet it caused plenty of chaos and consternation in the meantime. What to know about wildfires . Just over 500 acres burned, and so did 157 homes and eight commercial buildings, according to Cal Fire. Another four homes and three buildings suffered damage. There were fears that things could have gotten worse. The flames threatened about 1,000 homes and another 100 commercial buildings, spurring large-scale evacuations in Carrick and Weed, which is about 50 miles south of the Oregon border. Authorities threw significant resources at the wildfire -- using over 1,000 firefighters, 100 engines, 28 bulldozers and five helicopters -- to bring the blaze under control. As all this was going on, law enforcement was trying to figure out how it started. And throughout, according to Weed police, Marshall was ""a person of interest."" Police presented the case to the Siskiyou County District Attorney's Office this week for review, and a judge later issued a warrant for his arrest.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Two bodyguards in a convoy that was transporting Britain's ambassador were wounded when it came under attack Monday in the eastern Libya city of Benghazi, a British Foreign Office spokesman in London told CNN. ""We can confirm that they are being medically treated,"" the spokesman said. Ambassador Dominic Asquith was not hurt in the attack, the spokesman said. ""It was clearly involved in a serious incident, but we cannot confirm if there was an RPG attack, but shots were fired,"" the spokesman said. Libya's state news agency LANA had reported that a rocket-propelled grenade slightly wounded a diplomat in the convoy. The attack occurred near the university, LANA reported, citing a spokesman for the Supreme Security Committee in Benghazi.

"(CNN) -- Navy officers knew that Aaron Alexis had been arrested in 2004 for shooting out the tires of a car -- in a blackout fueled by anger -- and yet they admitted him into the Navy and granted him security clearance anyway, a senior Naval officer told CNN. ""It appears as if investigators were aware of the incident, interviewed him and were satisfied that it did not preclude granting the clearance,"" the officer said. Alexis, who killed 12 people Monday at the Washington Navy Yard, was a military contractor who used a valid identification to gain access to the secured facility, law enforcement officials said Tuesday. But experts, lawmakers and many in the media are now asking how Alexis was able to obtain that clearance, given his previous run-ins with the law -- some involving guns -- as well his checkered past in the Navy and a history of mental illness. Did government background investigations dig up the things about Alexis that news agencies managed to find out within hours? Experts weigh in . Alexis ""should have been screened out early on in his enlistment,"" said one expert on Navy processes, who asked not to be identified. ""The Navy and the various entities responsible for his adjudication were either unwilling or worse unable to determine he was unfit for service in the United States Navy."" The incidents in Alexis' past ""should have been a red flag that maybe we need to delve a little deeper into this individual,"" said retired Navy Cmdr. Kirk Lippold. 2008 arrest led to Alexis' Navy discharge . And private experts told CNN Alexis shouldn't have kept his clearance. ""In all of my experience with this, he absolutely should not have gotten a clearance. Anybody that I've encountered with any kind -- even half of this record -- does not get a clearance,"" said private attorney Sheldon Cohen, who specializes in clearance cases. The gun arrests alone should have disqualified him, Cohen said. A checkered past . The shooter at the Washington Navy Yard had a ""pattern of misconduct"" as a Navy reservist and sporadic run-ins with the law, and had contacted two Veterans Affairs hospitals for apparent psychological issues, sources have told CNN. Alexis told police he was hearing voices . At around 8 in the morning on May 6, 2004, Alexis used his Glock to shoot out two of the tires of a 1986 Honda Accord near a Seattle, Washington, home where Alexis was residing. He was ultimately arrested and charged with ""malicious mischief."" Alexis said that the owners of the car ""had disrespected him"" and that, he claimed, led ""to what Alexis described as a 'black-out' fueled by anger,"" according to the police report. Alexis also was arrested on a gun-related offense in 2010 as well as on a disorderly charge in 2008, but he was never prosecuted. Also, although he was honorably discharged as a Navy reservist, he had at least eight instances of misconduct while on duty, according to a US defense official. So why was he given clearance? ""The way it happens is a poor background check,"" says Tim Clemente, a former FBI counterterrorism agent. Navy officials are going back to see if his clearance should have been pulled. ""We're looking at his entire service record,"" Navy spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN's The Situation Room. ""See what red flags, if any, were missed, and if there's an accounting to be done."" How clearance works . Contractors can receive three levels of clearance: confidential, secret and top secret. Alexis had secret clearance, the middle category. Navy Yard shooting: What we know and don't know . A Defense Department office oversees clearance. Applicants fill out a very long form, which asks about any contact with police, charges and convictions. The form also asks about mental instability. Interviews with applicants follow. Before obtaining clearance as a contractor, Alexis would have theoretically been investigated by the Office of Personnel Management and ultimately granted clearance by ""DONCAF"" -- the Department of the Navy's Central Adjudication Facility, in Fort Meade, Maryland. An official at DONCAF refused to comment, referring CNN to the Pentagon. Kirby told CNN he couldn't speak for DONCAF or its process, but Alexis ""passed a routine security clearance back in 2007 when he enlisted. It was good for 10 years."" As a reservist Alexis was exempted from the periodic reinvestigation of clearance that active duty officers go through every 4Â½ years, or the polygraphs they go through every 2Â½ years. ""We're doing the forensics now to better understand if and how that clearance was reviewed,"" Kirby said. ""If we need to account for missed flags, we will. While not a stellar sailor, nothing Alexis did gave us an indication that he was capable of this brutal level of violence against people."" 'Secret' clearance granted in March 2008 . Alexis was given a ""secret"" security clearance in March 2008, shortly after he joined the Navy in 2007. He carried that clearance with him when he was honorably discharged in 2011, Kirby said, and could use it in another position so long as he is hired within two years. Alexis was hired by a company called The Experts in September 2012 to work on a HP contract in Japan refreshing computer systems. ""Because he wasn't out of work very long before this next job the security clearance went with him,"" Kirby said. ""We're taking a look at all the run-ins with the law if anything should have been done differently."" The initial background investigation on Alexis was done by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, Kirby said. A Defense Department statement issued Tuesday night said ""according to applicable federal investigative standards, an individual with Mr. Alexis' non-critical level of eligibility would only need to be reinvestigated once every 10 years."" The Experts issued a statement saying Alexis was properly screened. ""We enlisted a service to perform two background checks, and we confirmed twice through the Department of Defense his Secret government clearance,"" the statement said. ""The latest background check and security clearance confirmation were in late June of 2013 and revealed no issues other than one minor traffic violation."" With security clearance, Alexis worked from September 2012 through January in Japan. His clearance was renewed in July, and he worked at facilities in Rhode Island, North Carolina and Virginia for weeks at a time upgrading computer systems, according to Thomas E. Hoshko, CEO of The Experts. No one reported having any problems with him, Hoshko said. Alexis began working at the Navy Yard last week, though it was unclear whether he had actually begun doing work or was still securing his base clearance, Hoshko said. Lawmakers react . The possible red flags that went unnoticed have members of Congress outraged -- with promises to fix what they say could be gaping holes in the system. ""We are so reliant on military contractors"" that the vetting is key to our national security, Sen. Susan Collins told CNN. Collins, a Republican who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she now questions ""the kind of vetting contractors do."" Washington needs a lot more answers,"" Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-District of Columbia, told CNN Tuesday. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, is asking for a hearing to examine problems the shooting at the Navy Yard highlighted. ""In the wake of this tragedy, we must thoroughly review and fix deficiencies within existing federal contracting hiring practices that the alleged Washington Navy Yard gunman exposed and exploited to ensure the safety of the rest of our service familyâ€”servicemembers, civilian workers, and contractors, alike,"" Ayotte said. Government relies on contractors . In the 12 years since the September 11 attacks, the United States has ramped up contracting to support new defense and intelligence efforts. And contractors are a major reason the federal government can operate today as its workforce shrinks. According to statistics, last year it spent more than $500 billion -- or roughly 14% of the federal budget -- on private-sector contracts. That doesn't include many contracts awarded by the National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies, which keep their spending classified. There are already moves in Congress to tighten the security clearance system. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida is a co-sponsor of a bill to force government agencies asking for the background checks of potential clearance holders to increase oversight and to fire investigators who falsify those investigations. Because of the rise in number of contractors, federal agencies often farm out background check investigations before deciding whether to grant security clearance. While the process is supposed to be the same whether it is done by a government or private sector employee, some experts question whether that is the case. One of the largest private firms that specializes in these investigations, USIS, which did former NSA contractor Edward Snowden's background check, is under investigation, according to an official from the Office of Personnel Management who testified before Congress in June. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said at the hearing her staff had been informed of the company's ""systemic failure to adequately conduct investments under its contract"" with OPM. USIS has not commented on the investigation. Broader review planned . The issue of contractors also has the attention of the Obama administration. Because of the leaks from Snowden, the Director of National Intelligence was already examining who should have access to classified materials. Now officials say there will be a broader review of contractors and employees across all federal agencies. This review will look at the oversight, nature and implementation of security protections as well as looking at whether these employees and contractors are suited to work for the federal government, an administration official told CNN. ""I can tell you at the President's direction (the Office of Management and Budget) is examining standards for contractors and employees across federal agencies. So this is obviously a matter the President believes and has believed merits review,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday. Stan Soloway, president and CEO of the Professional Services Council -- the trade association for contractors -- told CNN that ""contract employees and government employees go through the same process."" He argues that the focus now should not be on how Alexis got his security clearance, but ""what are the procedures for access to facilities. ... How do you get into the building with a gun?"" CNN's Drew Griffin, Mariano Castillo, Dugald McConnell and Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","NEW: The Navy was aware of Aaron Alexis' 2004 arrest and granted him clearance anyway .

"(CNN) -- Jeffrey Fowle, an American arrested in North Korea in May for leaving a bible at a club for foreign sailors, has been released and is on his way home, a senior State Department official told CNN on Tuesday. An American government plane picked up Fowle on Tuesday before flying to Guam, the official said. North Korea announced Fowle's detention in June, saying he had violated the law by acting ""contrary to the purpose of tourism."" Although North Korea contains a number of state-controlled churches, the totalitarian regime forbids independent religious activities, viewing them as potential threats to its authority. CNN learned of Fowle's release earlier Tuesday but agreed not to report the news until he landed in Guam. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed Fowle's release on Tuesday, saying the Defense Department had arranged his transportation out of the country at the North Korean government's request. ""We certainly welcome the decision,"" Earnest said, adding that the United States has no updates on the status of two other Americans imprisoned in North Korea -- Matthew Miller and Kenneth Bae -- and calling on North Korea to ""immediately release them."" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf echoed Earnest's call, saying the U.S. government ""will continue to work actively on their cases."" She praised the ""tireless efforts"" of the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang, which houses the United States' representation within North Korea since the U.S. government doesn't have an embassy in the country. Sen. Rob Portman said he's pleased Fowle ""is returning home to his family and can close the chapter on a horrific ordeal in North Korea."" The Ohio Republican said he spoke with Fowle's wife and Robert King, the U.S. special envoy on North Korean human rights issues, after Fowle -- a Miamisburg, Ohio resident -- was detained. He said he worked with the State Department and ""many other entities to bring him home."" ""North Korea is a country with egregious human rights violations and it's important that the U.S. continue to stand for the rights of all people, including religious freedoms, at home and abroad,"" Portman said. ""My prayers are with Mr. Fowle and his family as he makes the transition home."" Last month, Fowle gave an interview to CNN pleading for U.S. help and speaking about conditions of his detention. He spoke to CNN with Bae and Miller. In the interview, Fowle said he has ""no complaints"" about his treatment. ""It's been very good so far, and I hope and pray that it continues, while I'm here two more days or two more decades,"" he said. North Korean officials monitored and recorded the interviews and CNN was unable to assess independently the conditions under which the men were being held. ""It's a covert act and a violation of tourists' rules. I've admitted my guilt to the government and signed a statement to that effect and requested forgiveness from the people and the government of the DPRK,"" Fowle said. Fowle said at the time he expected his trial to start within a month. Bae, a Korean-American missionary, was sentenced to 15 years hard labor in 2013. He told CNN he was working eight hours a day, six days a week at a labor camp, but was being treated ""as humanely as possible."" Miller was accused of tearing up his tourist visa and seeking asylum upon entry. He told CNN his situation was ""very urgent"" and would soon be sent to trial and ""directly be sent to prison."" All three implored the U.S. government to send an envoy to North Korea to help get them out of their situations, similar to how former President Bill Clinton helped secure the release of two journalists in 2009. However it did not appear such an envoy was sent to negotiate Fowle's release. The senior State Department official said the U.S. was still working to secure the release of Bae and Miller. Eric Bradner contributed to this report.","An American government plane picked up Fowle on Tuesday before flying to Guam .

"(CNN) -- It turns out going to the moon is a tough act to follow. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin walks on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. For all their Buck Rogers, ""Right Stuff,"" history-making achievements, the question for many of the 12 astronauts who walked on the lunar surface starting four decades ago ultimately became ""one giant leap to where, exactly?"" ""You have your peak experience at 38 or 39,"" says space historian Andrew Chaiken, summing up their collective experience, ""and [they] have a hard time coming up with something to do for an encore."" Apollo 11 lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on July 16, 1969. Four days later, the first two humans walked on the lunar surface; 10 more Americans followed by the end of 1972. In the 40 years since the Apollo program first took humans to the moon, the astronauts' lives have taken diverse paths. Almost all had been military test pilots before joining NASA; in later life, they found themselves ministers, politicians and conspiracy buffs. Some struggled with common issues: Many of their marriages fell apart and alcoholism affected at least one. In possibly the most extreme case of post-Apollo readjustment, Buzz Aldrin -- the second human being to set foot on the moon -- became a car salesman in Texas. ""Not very successfully,"" the 79-year old Aldrin quickly acknowledges. The Apollo 11 lunar module pilot's post-flight battles against depression and alcoholism have been well-documented, most recently in his own memoir, ""Magnificent Desolation."" As for a brief stint hawking Cadillacs in the late 1970s, Aldrin told CNN Radio, ""Most people who have received a degree of public recognition find themselves financially pretty well off. Doesn't happen to be the case with astronauts."" Others took more existential, even spiritual, approaches to dealing with their lunar experiences. Apollo 15 Lunar Module Pilot Jim Irwin left NASA and became a Baptist minister. Apollo 14 crewman Edgar Mitchell spent years investigating possible extraterrestrial life; in April, he went public with claims of a government cover-up. Apollo 12 moonwalker Alan Bean, now 77, has spent the intervening decades since his 1969 landing putting his impressions of the lunar experience on canvas. ""That's How It Felt To Walk on the Moon"" is the title of one his paintings, which now fetch starting-prices of $20,000. ""These paintings are the only paintings in history from anywhere else but this Earth,"" Bean told CNN. Not all the Apollo astronauts' post-flight journeys have been so ethereal. America's first man in space, Alan Shepard, who later walked on the moon in 1971's Apollo 14 mission, became a millionaire businessman. Apollo 17's Harrison Schmitt -- a geologist at the time, and the only scientist to make the lunar journey -- served a term as U.S. senator from New Mexico, but was defeated in a run for re-election in 1982. Apollo 11 command module pilot Michael Collins served as a top official at the Smithsonian Institution and its National Air and Space Museum. And the first man to leave footprints in the lunar dust, Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong -- aside from geologist Schmitt, the only other civilian in the collection of moonwalkers -- later sat on several corporate boards and the presidential commission that investigated the 1986 Challenger space shuttle disaster. Armstrong is also known for a series of disputes over autographs, which he long ago stopped signing because he discovered his signature was being sold for profit. He also sued Hallmark in 1994 for featuring his famous ""One small step"" quote in a space-themed Christmas ornament. News reports say the suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Armstrong's haircuts also became famous. In 2005, he threatened legal action after learning his longtime barber had sold a lock of his hair for $3,000. All part of the territory, says Chaiken. His book ""Voices From the Moon"" is based upon interviews with the surviving Apollo astronauts, and he concludes there's no ""lunar syndrome"" that's sent the moonwalkers down paths odder than any dozen former colleagues in other lines of work. ""I think the whole subject of the effects of going to the moon is something that gets overstated,"" Chaiken says. If there is a common emotion among the astronauts, four decades after the Apollo achievement, it may be simple disappointment over space exploration -- or the lack of it. ""It's all fallen apart,"" Aldrin says, talking about what may prove a half-century gap between American lunar landings. ""We have just taken the wrong pathway."" Chaiken agrees this is a near-universal astronaut refrain. ""They really have never expected that it would be this long. That here we would be -- 40 years after the first moon landing -- still wondering when humans will return to the moon. I think they're all frustrated by that."" CNN's John Zarrella contributed to this report.","A dozen men walked on the moon, and each later followed a different path .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British Royal Navy nuclear submarine and its French equivalent collided while on operations in the Atlantic Ocean earlier this month, defense ministries in Paris and London confirmed Monday. The British Royal Navy submarine HMS Vanguard. Both vessels, HMS Vanguard and Le Triomphant, were armed with nuclear warheads and suffered damage but were able to return to port under their own power following the collision. ""Two ""SNLE"" (nuclear submarines), one French and the other British, were, a few days ago, on standard patrols in the Atlantic. They briefly came in contact in a very slow speed while they were immersed,"" the French Ministry of Defense said in a statement. ""There is no casualty or injury among the crew. Neither the nuclear deterrent mission nor the nuclear security have been compromised."" In an earlier press release issued on February 6, the Ministry of Defense said the vessel's sonar dome had been damaged in a collision. The vessel was able to return to its base at Ile Longue in Brittany, northwest France, accompanied by a frigate. The UK's Ministry of Defence also confirmed the incident. In a statement, the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Jonathan Band said the collision occurred during ""routine national patrols.""  Watch Band describe ""slow-speed impact"" » . ""Both submarines remained safe and no injuries occurred. We can confirm that the capability remained unaffected and there has been no compromise to nuclear safety,"" Band said. HMS Vanguard returned to its home base at Faslane in Scotland on February 14. The UK's Sun newspaper reported that dents and scrapes were visible on the vessel's hull as it was towed into dock by a tugboat. Both the UK and French nuclear deterrent operations depend on complete secrecy, despite both countries' membership of NATO. But naval analyst Richard Cobbold told CNN that procedures would be in place to ensure that French and British submarines were routinely kept apart. ""Either one of these submarines was doing something different or somebody made a mistake -- but we don't know that,"" Cobbold said.  Watch why the collision is an embarrassment for both the British and the French » . Both submarines were equipped with state-of-the-art sonar technology, but Cobbold said it was possible that neither was aware of the close proximity of the other vessel. ""Modern submarines are very, very quiet. In many types of water conditions they might not hear the approach of another submarine,"" he said. But with both nations keeping at least one nuclear-armed submarine constantly at sea for the past 40 years, he said it was no surprise that they had eventually ended up in the same area of ocean. ""Even in an ocean the size of the North Atlantic the submarines are eventually going to be in the same patch of water at the same time,"" he said. In a statement issued Monday, the UK-based Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament described the incident as ""a nuclear nightmare of the highest order."" ""The collision of two submarines, both with nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons onboard could have released vast amounts of radiation and scattered scores of nuclear warheads across the seabed,"" said CND chair Kate Hudson. ""The dents reportedly visible on the British sub show the boats were no more than a couple of seconds away from total catastrophe."" Hudson said the incident was the most serious involving a nuclear submarine since the sinking of the Russian Kursk in 2000 with the loss of the vessel's entire 118-man crew. HMS Vanguard, which was launched in 1992, is one of four submarines which make up the UK's nuclear deterrent. Its firepower includes 16 Trident II D5 missiles capable of delivering multiple warheads to targets up to a range of 4,000 nautical miles. The 150-meter vessel carries a crew of 141 and is powered by a uranium-fueled pressurized water reactor. Vanguard Class submarines routinely spend weeks at a time underwater on patrol in the North Atlantic. But contact with naval commanders and government officials, including the defense secretary and the prime minister, is maintained at all times by a ""comprehensive network of communications installations,"" the Royal Navy Web site said. Le Triomphant was launched in 1994 and entered service in 1997 with a crew of 111, according to the GlobalSecurity.org Web site. Its weapons include 16 M45 missiles capable of launching multiple nuclear warheads. The UK has maintained a nuclear arsenal since 1956, with at least one nuclear-armed submarine somewhere at sea continuously since 1969. In 2006 the government approved plans to develop a new generation of nuclear weapon-carrying submarines which is due to be ready to replace the Vanguard Class by 2024. But the program, which is expected to cost around £20 billion ($29 billion), has been heavily criticized by anti-nuclear campaigners.","British, French nuclear submarines collide in Atlantic, defense ministries confirm .

His son, Sajjan Gohel, is director for international security at the foundation. They provide analysis to the media, government agencies and military departments. M.J. Gohel, left, and Sajjan Gohel say the attacks had the hallmarks of a transnational group. LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Indian media have described the Mumbai terrorist siege as India's 9/11. The targets for the attacks, many of them symbols of Mumbai's growing power and wealth, were not randomly selected and were intended to send a direct message to India, Israel and the West. Indeed, the Mumbai attacks had all the hallmarks of a powerful transnational terrorist group inspired by the ideology of al Qaeda. Mumbai is no stranger to terrorism. On March 12, 1993, a series of 15 bombs exploded across several districts of India's financial capital, killing 257. On July 11, 2006, a coordinated bombing spree on the city's transportation system killed 209 people. Uniquely disturbing about the recent Mumbai attacks, in addition to killing locals, is the deliberate targeting of restaurants and hotels used by Westerners and a Jewish cultural center. Mumbai is to India as New York is to the United States or London to the United Kingdom. The city is driving India's economic boom. It is the commercial and entertainment capital of the country, where the ""Bollywood"" film industry is based. It is the heartbeat of India. What happens there vibrates throughout the nation. Three factors may help explain the timing of the attacks. First, they occurred on the eve of America's Thanksgiving, as hotels in Mumbai were preparing for the event by putting on functions for the Americans living, working and on vacation in Mumbai. Secondly, a major international cricket tournament, the Twenty20 Champions League, was going to take place the following week. Some of the matches were going to be played in Mumbai, but the attacks resulted in the tournament being postponed. Thirdly, important state elections are taking place in parts of the country. They are being closely contested between the major political parties, and security was a key election issue. The events in Mumbai have left the nation divided as to how to respond. In fact, in the past 12 months, /topics/India"" class=""cnnInlineTopic"">India has endured more terrorist attacks in more parts of the country than in any previous recorded period. Cities such as Bangalore, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and the capital, New Delhi, have been hit. However, those attacks involved rudimentary timed-explosives left in public places. The latest events are different in terms of method and scale, with cells of well-armed men involved in synchronized assaults. The gunmen were also clearly prepared to die in their attacks but not to kill themselves as suicide bombers do. They were on a ""fedayeen"" mission. In effect, they were hoping to kill as many people as possible while being taken down in a hail of bullets by the security forces in the ensuing shootout. Fedayeen attacks are not uncommon in India. On December 13, 2001, five gunmen drove into India's parliament complex in New Delhi and opened fire indiscriminately. Although no members of parliament were harmed, eight people and the five terrorists were killed. Lashkar-e-Toiba, a Pakistan-based terrorist group affiliated with al Qaeda, was blamed for that attack. The incident almost brought India and Pakistan into a full-scale conflict, but that was averted by the intervention of the United States, Russia and China. Although the Lashkar-e-Toiba is banned in the United States and the European Union, it has tried to operate under different names, including Jamaat-Ud-Dawa and Idara Khidmat-E-Khalq. Indian authorities are accusing the group of being tied to the recent attacks in Mumbai. However, Pakistani authorities deny there is a connection to their country. Some have suggested the Mumbai attacks cannot have a transnational connection because al Qaeda uses the tactic of suicide bombers and does not indulge in hostage-taking. It is pertinent to point out that al Qaeda does not have a written constitution in how to kill, but the end goal is always the same: inflict mass-casualty atrocities with economic, political and social consequences. In any case, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian terrorist who officially aligned his group to al Qaeda, graphically introduced the tactic of hostage-taking in Iraq. U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl was taken hostage in Karachi, Pakistan, and eventually murdered under the order of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, al Qaeda's master planner of 9/11. The March 11, 2004, train bombings in Madrid, Spain, which killed 190 people, were not suicide attacks nor orchestrated by al Qaeda central, but its doctrine certainly motivated the plotters. Likewise, although al Qaeda may not have directly planned and coordinated the Mumbai attacks, the gunmen were clearly inspired by the goals and ideology that Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri preach. It could be argued that Mumbai was targeted by the terrorists because other places in the West have proved harder to attack. U.S. counterterrorism agencies have stepped up efforts since 9/11. British services have foiled plots linked to al Qaeda since the 2005 transportation bombings, and Israel has significantly reduced the plethora of suicide attacks it once faced. The Mumbai gunmen were well-prepared and trained. The terrorists had done their reconnaissance and planning, which would have taken months to coordinate. They knew the terrain and locations. They had worked out the internal infrastructure and layout of the buildings and moved with stealth, combing their way through 10 locations and creating devastation along the way. Unlike most terrorist attacks of recent years, the Mumbai siege lingered primarily because the gunmen had taken hostages. The focus of the international community remained fixated on events in Mumbai with wall-to-wall coverage from the world's media. Unlike suicide bombing, hostage-taking can be played out over several days. Terrorists have become skilled in using the media as their oxygen of publicity to convey fear and inflict paralysis. Understandably, some have questioned how, if official estimates are accurate, 10 terrorists could have caused so much bloodshed and repelled India's security apparatus for more than three days in three different buildings. The challenge for the authorities was to eliminate the terrorists and not the hostages. The gunmen had embedded themselves in the buildings and were well-equipped and able to return fire and lob grenades at the Indian forces trying to clinically extract them. It's worth remembering that on 9/11, it took only 19 people, with only box cutters as their weapons, to hijack four commercial flights. With basic flight training, they used three of those planes as guided missiles into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. As has been demonstrated in the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain, it is easier for terrorists to operate and function in a free and democratic society. For counterterrorism authorities, foiling potential attacks is like an uphill treadmill. They have to be 100 percent successful all the time. The terrorists only need to be lucky once in order to inflict a mass casualty attack. Cities become huge because they are successful in economic terms. People migrate because they feel they would have better opportunities there. The total population of Mumbai is 18.5 million, and it is a city growing in economic terms every year, which gives the national economy huge momentum. Direct foreign investment helps build commercial relations with other countries, and it is this relationship the terrorists seem keen to disrupt and damage permanently. In the long-term, it is unlikely the Indian economy will be deflected by terrorism anymore than Western economies have been fundamentally weakened by terror in New York or London, so the attack may not undermine the commercial fabric of the city. But it will leave deep indelible scars for Mumbai residents. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of M.J. Gohel and Sajjan Gohel.","Gohels: Some in the media are calling Mumbai attacks India's 9/11 .
They say attacks bore signs of transnational group inspired by al Qaeda .
Mumbai siege lingered primarily because gunmen had taken hostages, Gohels say .

"(CNN) -- Typhoon Vongfong weakened Saturday but still tossed intense rain and waves at the Japanese island of Okinawa, including the major U.S. military base there. The storm's sustained winds dropped Saturday to about 75 knots (86 miles per hour) from earlier sustained highs on Friday of 155 knots (178 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. That makes it equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane. Track the storm . Military news reports warned U.S. personnel assigned to Kadena Air Base to expect damaging winds of 57 mph or greater through 9 a.m. Sunday. ""For your own safety stay indoors and continue to shelter in place until given instruction otherwise,"" Armed Forces Network Okinawa posted on Facebook. Marine Gunnery Sgt. Brian Griffin provided CNN with an iReport containing video shot by military videographers showing palm trees lashed by intense winds and rain. ""It is an intense storm and we have been inside for the past 26 hours,"" he said. ""The island is well prepared for the storm. Housing is constructed with these storms in mind and base residents listened to military officials when instructed to prepare their homes for this storm."" The storm is predicted to make landfall on the Japanese mainland islands Sunday or Monday, bringing the threat of gale-force winds, high waves and storm surges on Kyushu and Shikoku islands especially, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The storm comes on the heels of Typhoon Phanfone, which swept over southern Japan earlier this week, washing three U.S. airmen -- out to sea on Okinawa. U.S. and Japanese search crews found the last airman's body on Wednesday, according to a press release issued by authorities at Kadena.","Vongfong pours intense rain on Okinawa .

"London, England (CNN) -- A secret document that appears to show that Iran was working on building nuclear weapons as recently as 2007 is ""alarming"" and ""part of a body of evidence backing up deep concerns over Iran's nuclear program,"" a Western diplomatic source with knowledge of the papers told CNN on Monday. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, has a copy of the secret papers, which were also obtained by the Times of London, the source said. IAEA officials confirm they are investigating the document but said they have not formally asked Iran for more information about it. A top international nuclear expert said it seemed to point to Iranian efforts to build a bomb. ""The only realistic use of this is in a nuclear weapon,"" said David Albright, the president of the Institute for Science and International Security. ""It shows that either Iran is developing the capability [to build nuclear weapons] or it is moving to implement a bomb program -- and either one is bad,"" said Albright, who reviewed the document for the Times before the newspaper published its report Sunday. But Albright warned that the document is edited and has no date on it. The source who gave it to the Times said it was from 2007, but neither the Times nor the ISIS was able to date it definitively, Albright said. In Iran, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said the Times' ""claim that Iran is working on the final and important component of a nuclear bomb is false and not worth paying any attention to,"" the semi-official Fars news agency reported. ""This type of statement is made in the media to put political and psychological pressure [on Iran] by the officials of various countries,"" Mehmanparast said, according to the Fars report. United States intelligence concluded in 2007 that Iran had suspended work on its nuclear weapons program in 2003. In the National Intelligence Estimate released in December 2007, the U.S. intelligence community dramatically reversed course from its 2005 evaluation. It expressed ""high confidence"" in 2005 that the Islamic Republic was working toward nuclear weapons, then two years later said -- also with ""high confidence"" -- that Iran had stopped its weapons program in 2003. Iran denies seeking to build nuclear weapons, saying its nuclear program is to produce civilian energy and medical research. But it is under intense pressure from the international community, with Britain and France saying last week they would push for stronger U.N. sanctions on Tehran. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wouldn't comment on the secret document Monday, but told reporters that concerns about Iran's nuclear program ""have been heightened already"" in recent months after revelations of a once-secret nuclear enrichment facility near the Iranian city of Qom, and Iran's Cabinet authorizing the construction of at least 10 new nuclear production facilities. She said the Obama administration has taken a ""dual-track"" approach to Iran, including the offer of engagement and taking part in nuclear talks. ""We've been at the table. But I don't think anyone can doubt that our outreach has produced very little in terms of any kind of positive response from the Iranians,"" Clinton said, adding that the second approach -- the international pressure -- is key to pushing Iranian officials to change ""their actions and decisions concerning the nuclear program."" Mehrdad Khonsari, a former Iranian diplomat, says the revelation about the document ""means, essentially ... that the Iranians have been lying to everybody"" when they said they were not seeking to build nuclear weapons. Khonsari said it was no accident that this document appeared when it did. ""The fact that the document comes out at this time makes it very difficult for Russia and China not to go along with more sanctions,"" he said. It would also make it easier for ""Israel to go ahead with a unilateral strike"" on Iran's nuclear facilities, he added. ""The agenda will change as a result of the publication of this document unless the document is proven to be false by the Iranian authorities,"" said Khonsari, who is now a senior research consultant at the Center for Arab and Iranian Studies. Khonsari -- who left Iran after the Islamic Revolution in 1979 -- has not seen the original document but said the material published by the Times ""is what an authentic document would look like."" ""It places pressure on the Iranian government to try to use what time remains to get out of this situation,"" he said. According to a report dated Monday on the Web site of Albright's group, a neutron initiator is a critical component of a nuclear weapon. The ISIS report said the device ""would most likely be placed at the center of a fission bomb made from weapon-grade uranium"" and ""works by the high explosives compressing the nuclear core and the initiator"" to produce a ""spurt of neutrons"" as a result of fusion. ""The neutrons flood the core of weapon-grade uranium and initiate the chain reaction,"" the ISIS report said. Albright said the document described efforts to ""research and test a neutron initiator,"" a nuclear component for which he could not see ""any civil use."" ""They appear to be doing the right things,"" he said. ""But you don't know how it fits into a nuclear weapons program."" He also said the public had failed to understand a key part of the debate about Iran's nuclear program. ""It's not whether there is something or nothing, but whether there is a capabilities focus or an actual decision to build nuclear weapons,"" he said. ""It's not like an on-off switch, it's like a dimmer control."" CNN Senior International Correspondent Matthew Chance and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","NEW: Iran calls claim of work on nuclear bomb part ""false and not worth paying any attention to""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Porn icon Marilyn Chambers was found dead in her Los Angeles home Sunday night, but investigators do not suspect foul play, according to a Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman. Marilyn Chambers rose to fame as an adult-film actress in the 1970s. Chambers began her career in 1970 as a model for Ivory Snow soap, and starred two years later in the porn classic ""Behind the Green Door."" ""She was a really nice girl,"" said actor Ron Jeremy, who co-starred with Chambers in adult films starting in the 1970s. Chambers' death was a ""total shock,"" Jeremy said, because they had been scheduled to sign a contract Monday to perform together in an off-Broadway ""tongue-in-cheek"" re-enactment of the porn classic ""Deep Throat."" ""What's strange is that she was at a stage where she was totally happy and totally content with her life,"" Jeremy said. ""Her life was falling together, and she was doing really well."" A family member found Chambers, 56, in the mobile home where she lived in the Canyon Country area and called police Sunday evening, sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitemore said. The death appeared to be from natural causes, although toxicology tests have not been completed, Whitemore said. The coroner's investigation has not been completed, and no cause of death has been determined, according to a spokesman with the Los Angeles Medical Examiner's office. Although her career was mostly in X-rated films, Chambers' fame was boosted by the irony that her face had graced the Ivory Snow box, a soap advertised as ""99 and 44/100 percent pure."" Chambers eventually co-starred with all of the best-known porn actors of the 1970s and 1980s, Jeremy said.","NEW: She had been set to sign contract for off-Broadway show with Ron Jeremy .

"Ayotzinapa, Mexico (CNN) -- Students, parents, friends and residents of this town in southern Mexico are demanding justice in the case of a slain student they say was the victim of horrific torture. The slaying of Julio Cesar Mondragon, the shooting deaths of three of his fellow students and the disappearance of 43 others in Iguala, Mexico, are sending shock waves across the nation. What happened to Mondragon is difficult to describe. Those who knew the victim are outraged and fearful. The body of the 22-year-old college student was found lying on a street in Iguala in the early hours of September 27. The skin of his face had been peeled off and his eyes gouged out, according to witnesses and relatives who spoke to CNN. Authorities in Mexico confirmed the witnesses' accounts. Mayor, wife arrested in Mexico missing students case . Mondragon was a student at a rural teachers college in Ayotzinapa, Guerrero state. Fellow students say that on the night of September 26, a group of about 100 of them, including Mondragon, decided to go to Iguala, about two hours away, to stage a protest in Iguala. According to authorities, the students, traveling in buses and a van, were attacked and fired on by Iguala police officers. Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam says the officers were working with a criminal gang that had deep ties with local government in Iguala and the nearby town of Cocula. Six people, including three students, died in the shootings. Aldo Gutierrez Solano, a 19-year-old student who was shot in the head, is in a coma. Forty-three of students were abducted by the officers and remain missing. The Iguala incident in has sparked protests all across Mexico, some of them violent. There have been multiple acts of vandalism in Guerrero state. Protesters have blocked roads and toll booths in cities like Chilpancingo, the capital. They have also blocked access to shopping malls in the beach resort of Acapulco. Former Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda, were arrested Tuesday. They had been staying in a run-down house in an impoverished neighborhood in Mexico City. Mexican officials say the couple, along with the town's director of public safety, are the ""probable masterminds"" of the attack against the students. They were known by Mexican media as ""the imperial couple."" Political enemies say they ran Iguala as if it were their personal fiefdom. Nearly a month after the Iguala incident, Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre, who was criticized for not acting quickly enough after the abductions, requested and was granted a leave of absence. 'I heard screams and thought it was him' Neri de la Cruz, an 18-year-old student at the teachers college, says Mondragon was one of his best friends. They would often get together in his dorm at the teachers school or attend events. ""He would always come to me to ask for help with chores and assignments because sometimes he needed to go home for several days to work and make money to feed his family,"" de la Cruz says. De la Cruz was one the students on their way to the protest. He says that when the shooting started, Mondragon ran away. ""Sometime later I heard screams and thought it was him, but I couldn't find him,"" de la Cruz said. De la Cruz was one of the first to see the picture of Mondragon's body. He struggles to talk about the gruesome details, but says that publicly demanding justice for Mondragon is the best way to honor his memory. ""When I looked at the picture I noticed that all of his face skin was missing and the eyes had been removed,"" de la Cruz says, ""I recognized the body because of the clothes he was wearing."" The victim's 24-year-old wife told CNN she identified the body through some of her husband's unique features, moles on his feet and chest. She declined an interview, saying she is afraid for her daughter's safety and her own. CNN is not identifying her. Opinion: Where are Mexico's 'Lost Boys' Julio Cesar Mondragon had dreams of getting a higher education, his wife says. He started attending the college in Ayotzinapa in July. He had also just become a father. His first child, a girl, was born in August.

"(CNN) -- In the tense standoff between a Maine nurse and state officials, it was a surreal scene. Nurse Kaci Hickox, who recently returned to the United States after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, went on a bike ride with her boyfriend Thursday -- followed by a police cruiser and a throng of journalists watching their every move. Her lawyer called the ride ""a good way to exercise her right."" Hickox told reporters she ""just wanted to enjoy this beautiful day."" Hours later, Gov. Paul LePage said negotiations with Hickox over where she could go had failed, adding that he would ""exercise the full extent of his authority allowable by law"" to keep her away from public places. ""I don't want her within three feet of anybody,"" LePage told CNN affiliate WCSH. ""Right now, she can come out of the house if she wants, but we can't protect her when she does that. The reason there's a police car there when she does that is to protect her more than anybody. 'Cause the last thing I want is for her to get hurt,"" he said. ""But at the same token, her behavior is really riling a lot of people up, and I can only do what I can do. And we're trying to protect her, but she's not acting as smart as she probably should."" The state has made it clear it's going to do something. But what? ""The first thing the governor has to do, which he has not yet done, is get a court order which requires her to stay in quarantine,"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""There is no court order now. She's not violating anything by taking a bike ride or leaving her house."" There's no guarantee the governor will be able to get a court order, Toobin said, ""because, according to the science, she is not in a communicable situation."" It's unclear what the exact sticking point has been in negotiations between the state and the nurse. At first, Maine officials said they wanted Hickox to remain at home for 21 days -- the deadly virus' incubation period. Since then, they've said they want Hickox -- who has twice tested negative for Ebola and says she feels healthy -- to avoid public places such as stores during that time. She's about halfway there; the incubation period, in her case, is set to end the second week in November. ""I'm just asking her to be reasonable,"" LePage told WCSH. ""Let's get to November 10, and then you can do whatever you would like."" Attorney: Nurse was making a point with bike ride . Hickox has said it's state officials who aren't being reasonable. She contends the U.S. Constitution and science are on her side. ""I'm fighting for something much more than myself,"" she said Wednesday after emerging from the home where she had been staying. ""There are so many aid workers coming back. It scares me to think how they're going to be treated and how they're going to feel."" Hickox has said she's willing to compromise with the state, and that she's open to travel restrictions barring her from public transportation and limiting her to Fort Kent, a town of 4,000 on the Canadian border. ""So I think there are things that, I know, work,"" she said. ""And I know all aid workers are willing to do those things. But I'm not willing to stand here and let my civil rights be violated when it's not science-based."" One of her attorneys, Norm Siegel, told CNN that the couple went for the bike ride to make a point: She could be out in public ""without freaking everyone out."" ""You can take a bike ride, be in the public and not actually interact with people,"" Siegel said. ""We thought this was a good way to exercise her right. We didn't want anyone in the town to be scared, even though the fear is based in misinformation."" What could be next? When she returned from a month working with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone last week, Hickox had a temperature at an airport in Newark, New Jersey, officials said. She was put into an isolation tent.","Negotiations in Maine over nurse have failed, governor says .

"Londonderry, New Hampshire (CNN) -- A new CNN/ORC poll shows a statistical dead heat between New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and her GOP opponent Scott Brown, with Shaheen at 49%, Brown at 47%, and a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4%. Perhaps even more telling is another politician's approval rating, and he's not even in the Granite State. President Barack Obama has only a 39% approval rating in New Hampshire, the new poll shows. Fifty-seven percent of voters say they disapprove of the way he is handling his job. That's a far fall for a president who beat his Republican opponents here in the Granite State overwhelmingly in both 2008 and just two years ago in 2012. And that's part of the problem. Brown and his supporters are tying the incumbent senator to the president, as exemplified by a recent campaign sign from Brown supporters: ""Stand with Obama, vote for Shaheen."" The '99 percent' factor . It's why Brown rarely speaks a sentence without tying Shaheen to the president. ""She's voting with the president 99% of the time,"" Brown told us over and over, just has he did minutes earlier at a small business event here earlier this week. Shaheen is just as disciplined with her responses. ""You know, Scott Brown can talk about 99 percent all he wants,"" Shaheen told us later in Exeter. ""This race is not between the President and Scott Brown, this race is between me and Scott Brown."" Shaheen has something going for her that some Senate colleagues around the country in tough races do not. She is a former governor who is not only well known, but relatively well liked. Her favorability rating in the CNN/ORC poll is 52%, much higher than the president's. Brown is under water -- with 50% saying they have an unfavorable view of him, 48% favorable. Shaheen tries to exploit that by painting him as an opportunist -- repeatedly reminding voters that two years ago Brown was a senator from Massachusetts, until he lost. ""When he was in Washington representing Massachusetts he was there for the corporate special interests,"" Shaheen told CNN. ""I'm going to continue to remind people what he represented when he was in Massachusetts and it wasn't our middle-class families, it wasn't our small businesses, it wasn't what's good for New Hampshire,"" Shaheen told us. Brown and other Republicans insist he has beaten the carpetbagger issue by visiting with New Hampshire voters all over the state (he still drives the beat-up pickup truck that became famous in 2010 when he won Ted Kennedy's Senate seat in a Massachusetts special election). When asked about his move on the campaign trail, Brown notes that he was born in the Granite State and has family ties that go back generations. ""We have long and strong ties to New Hampshire and so does Senator Shaheen. We both care about New Hampshire so let's talk about where we're going, not about where we've been,"" Brown said. Fear-mongering? Another way strategists here in both parties agree Brown has made gains is by seizing on ripped-from-the-headlines national-security issues like the threat from ISIS and Ebola, and playing them as examples of how Washington is broken. Shaheen calls it fear-mongering, which Brown naturally dismisses. ""What I hear is that people are deeply concerned about the border, they're deeply concerned about ISIS, they're deeply concerned about the lack of clear and coherent foreign policy, and the fact that Senator Shaheen is on the Foreign Relations Committee and has endorsed those incoherent policies from day one,"" Brown told us. The ISIS threat does hit home here in a unique way. The first American beheaded, James Foley, was from New Hampshire. National versus local issues . While Brown's campaign aides are quite candid that they believe their path to victory is to nationalize the race by linking Shaheen to the President and playing up national-security issues, Shaheen is trying hard to keep it local. She is already known as someone with exceptional constituent services, now as senator and before that as governor. Even GOP sources here speak admiringly of her commitment to returning regularly for local events throughout her last six years in the Senate. Shaheen insists that is what people are most about. ""It's the people who are working now up at the Berlin prison because I went in and fought to get that prison open after it sat empty for 12 years, its the 12 people who are in their homes because I worked with them when they were being foreclosed on,"" Shaheen told us. ""I was at Lincoln Financial in Concord yesterday I didn't get one question about a national issue,"" she said. Keeping it local is a national Democratic strategy, in a climate where disapproval of the President and Washington in general leaves them little choice. Democrats are using it in North Carolina, too, with incumbent Kay Hagan as they pummel her GOP opponent on state education issues. Whether that strategy can work here and elsewhere may determine whether Democrats can keep control of the Senate during Obama's last two years in office. CNN's Adam Levy contributed to this report.","A new CNN/ORC poll shows a statistical dead heat .

"(CNN) -- Two suspected U.S. drone strikes in in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region have killed at least eight militants, Pakistani officials said Saturday. One strike targeted a hideout in eastern Afghanistan, near Pakistan's Khyber Agency, which is part of Pakistan's loosely governed tribal areas, the officials said on condition of anonymity. That strike killed at least four militants and injured many others, the source said. In the other incident, missiles hit a vehicle in Pakistan's North Waziristan -- another tribal area that borders Afghanistan -- killing four militants, including a commander, according to Pakistani intelligence sources. It wasn't immediately clear when the attacks happened. The sources didn't say which group or groups the militants represented. The tribal areas in northwestern Pakistan have long been a base for anti-government militants, including those with the Islamist Haqqani movement. The United States routinely does not comment on suspected drone strikes.","One strike kills four militants in Afghanistan, near Pakistan border, Pakistani officials say .

"(CNN) -- In a country where women aren't allowed to drive, a female engineer is showing her male colleagues a thing or two. Wearing a headscarf and science goggles, Jumana Almuzel is a rare sight on the shop floor of Saudi Arabia's GE gas turbine facility. Indeed, she is the only female to work alongside her male counterparts at the energy giant's Eastern Province plant. ""When I came to the shop floor I was working with the men side-by-side, and they were asking me some questions,"" said Almuzel, an American-educated mechanical engineer. ""We are helping each other, and they can see that I'm capable of understanding the mechanics behind the components that we are working on."" It's a radical change for a country where gender segregation is the norm, and just one in five women work. But change is afoot in this ultra-conservative kingdom, and it's being driven from the very top by the ruler King Abdullah. With around 8 million expatriate workers in the country, Saudi officials say there is an over-reliance on foreign labor. Watch: Meet the richest man in Saudi Arabia . Could local women entering the workforce be a way of combating that? An all-female business processing center has now opened in Riyadh, with plans to employ over 3,000 women. ""The irony is, many of the unemployed are highly educated females,"" said Khalid Al Falih, CEO of energy giant Saudi Aramco, at the opening of the new center. ""Over 50% of unemployed females hold a university degrees, and that's because mixed work environments are not available."" Meanwhile, Indian communications group Tata has already set up an all-female call center in Saudi Arabia. Despite these advances in women's work life, a major exception remains.

"COCHABAMBA, Bolivia (CNN)  -- A hundred years ago a Brazilian physician, Carlos Chagas, showed that monkeys were susceptible to a rare parasitic illness carried by a particular Latin American bug. A mother and baby visit a clinic in Bolivia to get tested for Chagas. Today an estimated 16 to 18 million people are infected with Chagas, as the disease is now known, and it claims some 50,000 lives each year. Yet most people have never heard of it. Chagas disease is exclusive to Latin America, and kills more people there than any other parasitic illness, including malaria. In Bolivia, an estimated one in five people are infected. So why is so little known about the disease? One crucial reason is that it only affects the poor. In the mud and thatch homes of rural villages and urban slums, bugs known locally as vinchuca, make their home in cracks in the walls and holes in the roofs. The bugs carry the parasite that causes chagas, in their saliva and their feces. Infection occurs when they bite, or if their are unknowingly eaten in uncooked food, or rubbed in the eye. Infected women can transfer chagas to their child during pregnancy, delivery or while breastfeeding. In its early stages, Chagas it is eminently treatable, but there are many problems. ""Most people don't know they've been infected,"" says Dr. Tom Ellman, who works in Bolivia with humanitarian agency, Doctors Without Borders. He told CNN: ""Many of them will drop down dead usually from heart problems cause by the disease 10, 20, 30 years after they've been infected and no one will know why."" For Dr. Ellman, this lack of effective treatment is a symptom of a much sadder cause. ""In terms of getting better treatment, you're not going to have the interest of pharmaceutical companies, who will only investigate new drugs if there is a market that is willing to buy them. ""What we need now is more interest. We're still using drugs invented over forty years ago, that have huge numbers of side effects and take sixty or ninety days to work,"" he told CNN. Even after these extensive courses of anti-parasitic drugs, there is no definitive test to see if the patient has been cured. Doctors can only advise patients to return in two years. Dr. Ellman also has particular concerns for children over the unavailability of new drugs: ""At the moment we have to cut adult doses of tablets into much smaller sizes for children which brings pricks of getting the dosage wrong and makes it much more complicated."" Chagas can be detected via blood test. In the clinics where Doctors Without Borders work, they advise parents to have themselves and their children tested whenever they visit a clinic. But the challenge they face is vast. How to make a population wise to the threat of a disease that is already plaguing them, and that many have still never heard of. Tom Peck contributed to this report .","Chagas is a deadly disease that largely affects people in Latin America .

"(CNN)  -- The announced pregnancy of Jamie Lynn Spears -- the 16-year-old children's television star and younger sister of beleaguered pop star Britney Spears -- is casting new light on how states deal with the thorny issue of consensual sex among teens. Jamie Lynn Spears, shown in September, stars in the popular Nickelodeon series ""Zoey 101."" Spears, the star of Nickelodeon's ""Zoey 101,"" told OK! Magazine that she's pregnant and that the father is her 18-year-old boyfriend. There has been no public talk of criminal prosecution in the case. Consensual sex between the two may well have been legal, depending on where and when it took place. But critics of the nation's statutory rape laws say that laws that are ignored in some cases can be used to put other teens in prison and land them on sex-offender registries.  Watch CNN's Sunny Hostin on what the law says » . ""You have a disturbing disparity in how these laws are enforced,"" said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. ""I have no problem at all with nailing adults who sleep with children, but I have a problem with the prosecution of teenagers in consensual relationships. ""What this case should focus the nation on is having a more evenhanded approach to these cases.""  Watch a psychologist talk about how Spears' pregnancy could lead to parents talking to their kids about sex » . In Louisiana, where Spears lives, it is a misdemeanor for someone age 17 to 19 to have consensual sex with someone age 15 to 17 if the difference between their ages is more than two years. In California, where she sometimes tapes her television show, it's a misdemeanor to have sex with someone younger than 18 if the offender is less than three years older. Someone more than three years older could be charged with a felony. According to OK! Magazine, which first reported the news Tuesday, Spears said the father of her baby is longtime boyfriend Casey Aldridge. Turley said most states have similar laws but rely on prosecutors to be selective in enforcing them. But that's a recipe for legal problems, he said. The issue drew international attention when a Georgia teen was sentenced to 10 years in prison for having consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl when he was 17. In 2005, Genarlow Wilson was tried for the rape of a 17-year-old girl at a hotel-room party. While he was found not guilty of that charge, he was convicted of aggravated child molestation for the act with the 15-year-old -- even though he was less than two years older. Georgia law, which has since been changed, required a mandatory 10-year sentence on the charge of aggravated child molestation and required Wilson to register as a sex offender when he was released. Under the revised Georgia law, the act now would be a misdemeanor.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Vice President Joe Biden apologized to Turkey's leader on Saturday for saying that President Recep Erdogan admitted his country had made mistakes allowing foreign fighters to cross into Syria. The apology came hours after Erdogan expressed his anger over the comments to reporters in Istanbul, saying ""Biden has to apologize for his statements."" Or Biden, he said, will become ""history to me,"" according to published reports by the semi-official Anadolu news agency. The problem appears to have originated during a question-and-answer session following a speech this week at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University when Biden was asked about Turkey and the threat posed by the so-called Islamic State terror group, known as ISIS or ISIL. ""President Erdogan told me, he's an old friend, said, 'You were right. We let too many people through.' Now they are trying to seal their border,"" he said, according to transcripts. Erdogan vehemently denied ever saying such a thing. ""The Vice President apologized for any implication that Turkey or other Allies and partners in the region had intentionally supplied or facilitated the growth of ISIL or other violent extremists in Syria,"" Biden spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said. ""The Vice President made clear that the United States greatly values the commitments and sacrifices made by our Allies and partners from around the world to combat the scourge of ISIL, including Turkey."" During their telephone conversation, Biden and Erdogan reaffirmed the two countries' commitment to fight the terror group, Barkoff said. Erdogan's office and the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment regarding Biden's apology. The issue has arisen at a sensitive time, with Turkey's government authorizing the use of military force against terror groups, including ISIS as its fighters laid siege to towns just south of the Turkish border. The government also agreed to allow foreign troops to launch operations against ISIS from Turkey. Until now, Turkey has offered only tacit support to the coalition. While Biden is known for making blunt statements that sometimes embarrass the administration, Turkey is particularly sensitive to allegations of allowing terrorists to cross its border into Syria. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has accused Turkey of looking the other way and, in some cases, providing support to rebels embroiled in the country's civil war. Turkey, in turn, has accused Syria of fomenting the unrest that has led to ISIS taking hold in the region.

"(CNN) -- Health care workers returning to New York who've had contact with Ebola patients but don't show symptoms can serve a mandatory 21-day quarantine in their homes, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday night. This is a change in the recently instituted state policy on health workers who return to the United States from the Ebola zone. Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had jointly announced a mandatory quarantine policy on Friday. Over the weekend, the Obama administration lobbied the governors to change it. The temperatures of a asymptomatic health care workers will be checked twice daily. Returning health care workers who show symptoms of the Ebola virus will be transported to hospitals for mandatory quarantine, according to a fact sheet on the new guidelines. People who return from the Ebola zones but didn't have contact with Ebola patients will be handled on a case-by-case basis, the fact sheet said. The fact sheet said the state would provide financial assistance to the quarantined health workers if their employers do not. In New Jersey, Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts said the Garden State's policy also allows at-home quarantines. ""New Jersey is not changing its quarantine protocol. The protocol is clear that a New Jersey resident with no symptoms, but who has come into contact with someone with Ebola, such as a health care provider, would be subject to a mandatory quarantine order and quarantined at home,"" Roberts said. ""Nonresidents would be transported to their homes if feasible and, if not, quarantined in New Jersey."" The Obama administration has been urging Cuomo and Christie to reverse their recently enacted policies that require a 21-day quarantine for all health workers who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa, The New York Times reported Sunday. The conflict has taken place privately in phone calls and negotiations, with federal officials saying they think the governors are wrong about needing a total quarantine, the Times reported. A senior administration official told CNN on Sunday that ""we have let the governors of New York, New Jersey and others states know that we have concerns with the unintended consequences of policies not grounded in science may have on efforts to combat Ebola at its source in West Africa."" President Barack Obama met with his Ebola response team Sunday. ""The President underscored that the steps we take must be guided by the best medical science,"" a White House statement said. ""He also emphasized that these measures must recognize that health care workers are an indispensable element of our effort ... and should be crafted so as not to unnecessarily discourage those workers from serving."" Also on Sunday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio talked about Ebola at a news conference but didn't offer any direct criticism of Cuomo or Christie. He did, however, mention a nurse under quarantine in New Jersey, saying ""what happened to her was inappropriate."" Mandatory quarantines -- now what? 'Disincentive for the health care workers' A top federal health official publicly criticized Christie and Cuomo on Sunday, saying the two states' quarantine rule could discourage health workers from helping fight Ebola in Africa, which would ultimately endanger the United States. ""I'm concerned of the disincentive for the health care workers,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. A federal policy starting Monday requires all travelers coming to the United States from Ebola-affected areas to be actively monitored for 21 days. The quarantine policy announced by Cuomo and Christie came one day after a doctor who treated patients in Guinea became the first Ebola case diagnosed in New York City and the fourth in the United States. Illinois also implemented a new rule. It is requiring ""high-risk individuals who have had direct contact with an individual infected with the Ebola virus while in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea"" to undergo a mandatory 21-day home quarantine, according to a news release from Gov. Pat Quinn's office issued on Friday. Christie says he's not backing down . Should health care workers be quarantined? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sets baseline recommendations. But state and local officials have the prerogative to set tighter policies. Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, expressed worries about stigmatizing health workers. In an interview aired Sunday before she traveled to Ebola-affected nations in West Africa, Power told NBC, ""We need many more than are going right now. We need to find a way when they come home that they are treated like conquering heroes and not stigmatized for the tremendous work that they've done."" The Pentagon Sunday would not say whether it's willing to still send an active duty military Ebola response team to states ordering mandatory quarantine for Ebola health care workers. The 30-person team finishes training Monday and will then be ready for deployment on 72 hours notice. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel would have to approve any deployment. The new policy for New York and New Jersey was implemented the same day nurse Kaci Hickox landed at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. She had worked with Doctors Without Borders, treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. New federal policy starts Monday . Hickox said she was ordered placed in quarantine at a hospital, where she tested negative in a preliminary test for Ebola. Still, hospital officials told her she must remain under mandatory quarantine for 21 days. ""This is an extreme that is really unacceptable, and I feel like my basic human rights have been violated,"" Hickox told CNN's Candy Crowley in an exclusive interview on ""State of the Union."" Complete coverage on Ebola . The new federal policy, which starts Monday, requires all travelers coming to the United States from Ebola-affected areas to be actively monitored for 21 days. Already, such travelers landing at five U.S. airports -- New York's Kennedy, Washington's Dulles, New Jersey's Newark Liberty, Chicago's O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta -- must go through enhanced screening. Ebola has killed nearly 5,000 people, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, in what health officials call the worst outbreak of the disease in history. How the Ebola virus spreads . New York Ebola patient's fiancee cleared . A New York doctor who tested positive for the Ebola virus was listed in serious but stable condition on Sunday, according to New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation President Dr. Ram Raju. Dr. Craig Spencer, 33, is in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. He arrived back from Guinea on October 17 and had limited his public interactions but did not eliminate them, according to officials. Spencer's fiancee, Morgan Dixon, had been under quarantine at Bellevue, but was cleared and has no symptoms, according to Weinberg, the city health department spokeswoman.

"Orlando, Florida (CNN)  -- Tiger Woods' mother-in-law, Barbro Holmberg, was released from a hospital in ""good condition"" Tuesday afternoon, hours after she was admitted, a hospital spokesman said. Holmberg -- the mother of Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren -- was admitted to Health Central Hospital in Ocoee, Florida, early Tuesday morning for stomach pain. Paramedics arrived at Woods' home in Orange County, Florida, after a 911 call was made at around 2:35 a.m., dispatch information shows. Hospital spokesman Dan Yates said that Holmberg, a regional governor in Sweden, was resting at Woods' home after being released around 2 p.m. ET. Yates would not comment further on Holmberg's hospital stay, saying only that she was in a ""good state and feeling much better."" Health Central Hospital is the same hospital where Woods was taken after he crashed his sports utility vehicle into a fire hydrant and a tree outside his mansion near Windermere on November 27. Eva Malmborg, a spokeswoman for Gavleborg County, where Holmberg is governor, told CNN that she had been taken to the Florida hospital because of abdominal pain. ""She is, after the circumstances, well,"" Malmborg said. ""We count on her being back at work on Monday."" There has been no comment on Wood's Web site regarding his mother-in-law's difficulties. Woods, 33, who tops the sport's world rankings, has been mired in controversy since the crash, which prompted authorities to cite him for careless driving and fine him $164. Woods was not required to talk to police about the wreck, and declined to talk with investigators on several occasions. A document from the Florida Highway Patrol released Monday shows that the patrol sought private medical records from Woods, saying investigators suspected the golfer may have been driving under the influence. More coverage from CNN affiliate WESH . More coverage from CNN affiliate WKMG . More coverage from CNN affiliate WFTV . Florida Highway Patrol trooper Joshua Evans filed the request to obtain Woods' blood test results because ""the witness who removed the driver from the vehicle"" said Woods consumed alcohol ""earlier in the day"" and that he had prescriptions for the painkiller Vicodin and the sleep aid Ambien. Woods' wife told investigators she pulled her husband from the vehicle after he crashed. The state attorney's office denied the subpoena request, however, citing ""insufficient information provided to issue subpoena,"" and Florida defense attorney Mark Eiglarsh, who specializes in DUI cases, said the evidence provided in the request was ""flimsy."" State attorney spokeswoman Danielle Traverneir said the request for the subpoena was fairly routine in such cases and that it was not uncommon to deny them. The Florida Highway Patrol has closed the case. Sgt. Kim Montes said Tuesday that the investigative subpoenas are a normal part of the investigation. ""When we meet with the state attorney, they make the final determination. It wouldn't be proper for us to comment on that,"" she said. In the week following the crash, the golfer apologized for ""transgressions"" that let his family down. The same day gossip magazine US Weekly published a report alleging Woods had an affair. ""I have let my family down and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart. I have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves,"" he said in a December 3 statement on his official Web site. US Weekly magazine printed a report alleging that Woods had an affair with Jaimee Grubbs, whom it identified as a 24-year-old cocktail waitress. The magazine also published what it says is a voicemail message from Woods to Grubbs. Share your thoughts on Tiger's 'transgressions' CNN could not independently confirm that the voice on the recording was Woods.

"Washington (CNN) -- If you've ever felt the urge to buy an Osama bin Laden action figure and have $2,500 to spare, Nov. 20 could be your lucky day. The doll, code named ""Devil Eyes,"" is one of three prototypes designed by Donald Levine, the creator of G.I. Joe, back in 2005 as part of a proposed CIA plan to take down the al Qaeda leader. The Washington Post originally reported that the spy agency considered selling demonic bin Laden figurines to scare Afghan children and their parents from supporting bin Laden and al Qaeda. The CIA rejected the plan after it reviewed the three prototypes, Dean Boyd, CIA spokesperson, confirmed to CNN in June. ""To our knowledge, there were only three individual action figures ever created and these were merely to show what a final product might look like,"" he said. ""Furthermore, the CIA has no knowledge of these action figures being produced or distributed by others."" Two of the dolls are either in the possession of the CIA or the Pentagon, according to the Washington Post. However, one lucky bidder can get his hands on the spare in an online auction by Nate D. Sanders auction on Nov. 20, according to a release Thursday from the auction house. The bidding starts at $2,500. The action figure, draped in bin Laden's long white robe, comes with two detachable heads. One head is the recognizable face of the al Qaeda leader with his long black beard and white turban. The other shows him as a demon with red skin, green ""Devil Eyes"" and black facial marks.","Auction will sell a rare Osama bin Laden action figure starting on Nov. 20 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Americans still strongly support airstrikes against ISIS -- but they're losing confidence that the strikes will wipe out the group's military capability, a new poll shows. The air strikes already ordered by President Barack Obama are supported by 76% of the public, a CNN/ORC International survey of 1,018 adults, conducted Oct. 24-26, found. However, only 48% of those polled say the U.S. effort is going well -- while 54% say they're confident the strikes will degrade and destroy the military capability of ISIS. That figure is down from 61% last month. As the public loses confidence in air strikes' effectiveness, Americans are increasingly supportive of sending U.S. ground troops to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The poll found 45% support for such a move -- up from 38% in September. A majority still oppose it however. And if ISIS were to attack the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, that number would shift much more dramatically, with 72% saying they'd then support sending ground troops to the region. ""Support for sending U.S. ground troops into combat operations against ISIS forces is growing, although a majority continues to oppose 'boots on the ground' in Iraq or Syria,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""But that could change in a hurry if the situation worsens in Iraq."" ISIS prisoners reveal life inside terror group . The poll also found a war-weary public with little faith in Obama, high confidence that a terrorist attack on U.S. soil will happen again soon and expectations that fighting ISIS will be a drawn-out engagement. Those surveyed said they aren't expecting to see ISIS quickly defeated. More than four in five said U.S. military action against the group will be long and difficult. Opinion: Is killing ISIS leader a good idea? Only 32% said they believe Obama has a clear plan for dealing with ISIS. Meanwhile, 59% said further acts of terrorism in the United States are likely over the next several weeks. That number is up from 55% in a September poll -- a small enough increase, Holland said, that it can't be attributed to a changed public mood after last week's attacks on the Canadian government.","76% of Americans support U.S. airstrikes on ISIS, a CNN/ORC International poll shows .

"(CNN) -- Months after video of its pledges shouting pro-rape chants went viral on YouTube, an elite fraternity chapter at Yale has been suspended. Yale College Dean Mary Miller announced the suspension of the university's Delta Kappa Epsilon chapter on Tuesday in an e-mail to students and faculty. A disciplinary body at the college ""imposed sanctions on the DKE chapter as an organization that prohibit it from conducting any fraternity activities on campus (including recruiting) for a period of five years,"" Miller wrote. The sanctions also ""prevent it from communicating with Yale students by means of Yale bulletin boards or Yale e-mail, and severely limit its use of the Yale name in connection with the DKE organization."" Punishments were meted out to individual fraternity members too, the dean said. The chapter drew widespread criticism last fall after its pledges chanted slogans that seemed to advocate rape, such as ""No Means Yes"" and ""Yes Means (a sex act)."" Video of the frat's antics circulated widely on the internet. Yale's disciplinary actions Tuesday come several weeks after officials confirmed the university was under federal investigation for a possible Title IX violation. The complaint that prompted the investigation alleged that the school's policies permitted a ""sexually hostile environment"" to exist on campus. Delta Kappa Epsilon has operated at Yale since 1844 and is ""the only fraternity at Yale which has never gone inactive,"" according to its website. The chapter's illustrious roster of former members includes presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. The international Delta Kappa Epsilon office did not immediately return a request for comment.","The suspension will last for five years, the school's dean says .

"(CNN) -- It is a question that the global community is seeking to understand as the crisis in Iraq and Syria deepens. How can such a numerically small force as ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, have taken control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, and how can it hold the ground taken while simultaneously conducting multiple offensive actions in both countries? The most recent CIA estimate in September 2014 put the total number of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria at between 20,000 and 31,500. But such numbers, while alarming, are not nearly enough to explain the stunning military successes the group has enjoyed. ISIS is at heart a guerrilla army that has recently captured large stocks of modern and heavy weaponry. While the equipment that makes headlines is war planes, captured tanks, heavy artillery and American-made Humvees, most ISIS fighters are still armed with the same mix of Soviet-era small arms and American M16/M4 pattern rifles that their Iraqi, Kurdish and Syrian opponents rely on. Much of the heavy equipment ISIS has at its disposal was captured during their lightning advance into Iraq, not before. It is not the core reason for their battlefield successes. However, what it does do is make planning any battle against ISIS forces an uncertain exercise because one may have to face weapons and vehicles from right across the capability spectrum. When it comes to offensives against prepared positions, ISIS forces can certainly deploy heavy artillery, modern weapons and tanks that give it greatly enhanced capabilities and completely outgun Kurdish Peshmerga forces in particular. Unconfirmed reports have suggested that ISIS even deployed a captured M1A1 Abrams in its takeover of the Mosul Dam, before eventually being driven back by repeated U.S. airstrikes. This is where airpower can make a difference since heavy artillery, tanks and armoured vehicles are vulnerable to airstrikes when concentrated in the open such as at the Mosul Dam and in the current offensive to take Kobani. What air power cannot do is easily degrade or neutralize ISIS's core advantages which are strong battlefield leadership, significant tactical autonomy and aggressive tactics. Their battlefield tactics are somewhat reminiscent of the German Blitzkrieg campaigns in the early part of World War II. They use fast, well-coordinated forces with vehicle support to attack enemy weak points in strength under the cover of long range artillery and mortar fire. A particular speciality is outflanking defensive positions and then mopping up defenders who attempt to retreat. The tactic is as much psychological as it is kinetic, and is greatly magnified by the horrendous and public brutality ISIS has systematically exhibited wherever it has gained control. Even well-motivated and equipped troops are likely to contemplate tactical withdrawals if outflanked and in danger of being surrounded by an unknown number of fanatical mass murderers with apparently superior weaponry and tactics. Where, as in Mosul, the defenders are poorly motivated, even small ISIS attacks are capable of provoking mass panic and routs. Kobani is an unusual operation for ISIS fighters in some respects, in that they appear committed to what has become a pitched battle in the open where they are vulnerable to airstrikes. Despite having surrounded Kobani and conducting aggressive and apparently well-coordinated infiltration attempts from multiple approaches, the sort of street-to-street ""meat grinder"" that Kobani has become does not play to ISIS's strengths. Against an enemy with nowhere to retreat to and air support, a numerically limited force such as ISIS that normally relies as much on psychological effects as firepower to take ground faces a tough challenge. This is just as well since on the ground, it is only the bravery of lightly armed Kurdish fighters standing between ISIS and control of the town. Airstrikes are essential but could not keep ISIS out of the town alone. In terms of defending the ground it has, ISIS appears to be efficient at quickly moving forces in strength to meet particular Iraqi and Peshmerga offensives. However, along most of the ""frontlines"" across Northern Iraq and Syria, a relatively small number of ISIS forces appear capable of pinning potential attackers in their defensive lines with a combination of reputation and sporadic mortar, sniper and machine-gun fire. Given the disorganized state of the ground forces arrayed against them, and the limitations of airpower for rolling back such an enemy, this may well be enough to allow ISIS to maintain control of most of its newly declared Caliphate for a long while yet.","Justin Bronk: The number of ISIS fighters is not enough to explain the group's success .

"Kigali, Rwanda (CNN) -- The dandy look has long been associated with the style of the quintessential gentleman. It's elegant and sophisticated with sharp lines and immaculately tailored suits. But certain gentlemen in various parts of Africa have now taken the look to the next level. These dapper dressers can often be seen strutting down the streets of Kinshasa or Brazzaville, as is the case with the Congo's ""sapeurs."" And now, thanks to up-and-coming ""Afro-dandy"" designer Matthew Rugamba, the look has also emerged in the Rwandan capital of Kigali -- but with a more local twist. Classy and elegant, Rugamba's label House of Tayo combines bold African patterns and textures with western accessories to produce wax-print bow ties, colorful pocket squares and infinite scarfs for ""Afro-dandies"" in Rwanda and beyond. We sat down with sartorially chic Rugamba to chat all things dandy: how to get the look; African influences; style icons and who he'd most like to see don his designs. CNN: Tell me what you mean when you describe the House of Tayo style as ""Afro-dandyism?"" Matthew Rugamba: It hits the nail on the head for my style and what I try to do with my pieces. The additional use of color, patterns, texture -- it's uniquely African. Then going to boarding schools -- you had to have your shirt tucked in, tie done. So many different influences have had an impact on me and helped me deliver my personal style which I have integrated into House of Tayo. CNN: And what's this different side of Africa that you want to show? MR: One of the reasons I started House of Tayo was because I was actually going to school in the United States, and I had so many questions about how life is in Rwanda. Many people had these negative assumptions. They had notions of how bad life was here, poverty, war. And it used to bug me a lot. CNN: So you got sick of telling your friends they were wrong all the time? MR: Not necessarily my friends because I talk to them all the time. Just different people. It could be as random as the coffee shop conversation while you're waiting in line, those were the bits and pieces that would get under my skin. At least with my friends i could say, ""Guys, come on! Let me show you pictures. You could visit me.""And it was just this other ... you sit in a classroom and there is a limit to the amount of times you can correct people or even just if you are meeting someone for the first time, you're not going to go into this tirade of why you believe that their perceptions were wrong. CNN: Fair enough. Well what about House of Tayo showcases the styles and influences from Rwanda, then? MR: I think it's not necessarily Rwanda alone because I also lived in a couple of African countries, but I feel like general use of color, variation and also the presentation. Also the fact that its made in Rwanda and I'm using bits and pieces that are sourced locally. One of the things that I started doing, the sliders and the hooks for the soft tie bow ties, are made out of cow horn for my newest collect. Cows are a big part of our culture here in terms of dowry and sustenance and history. CNN: Style icons? MR: I'd say Ozwald Boateng. Reading his story, it's just fascinating and he's also African, originated from Ghana. His unique use of color while intertwined with his personal experience and history with British tailoring -- he's up there for my style icons. CNN: With you being a new startup, which designer label would you most like to emulate? MR: Burberry. They remain contemporary and release collections like every other designer but there is a strong sense of heritage and history there that I really admire. CNN: Do you have a favorite piece from your latest collection? MR: I've been figuring out how I can recreate the experience of going to your tailor and having something made for you and recently I partnered with a company called ""Full Circle"" based here in Rwanda and we've been developing an app. There's a special collection of bow ties I'm making right now and what will happen, the box will have a QR code and when you scan the QR code you can see your bow tie being made. CNN: Cool combination of combining tech to the label. MR: It's also bridging that gap between the customer and the person making the product in a way that I haven't really seen being done before. And for me that's really amazing that half way across the world my customers would be able to see the working conditions, be able to almost have a personal connection with both the brand and the person that made the product. I think it will be really cool. CNN: So who'd you most like to see wearing your designs on the red carpet? MR: Celebrities who are bold. Celebrities who are fearless and have a real sense of self. A few of the names that come to mind are; Pharrell, Janelle Monae, Samira Wiley, Idris Elba, Serge Ibaka, Tinie Tempah, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Lupita Nyong'o, Michael K. Williams. CNN: Right, last question: what advice would you give to aspiring entrepreneurs? MR: You have to take that leap of faith, if you feel so strongly about it then do it. I feel like if you feel strongly enough about something you will do it. It doesn't matter if you're an extravert, introvert, you will start something.

"(CNN) -- DJ and TV host Jimmy Savile was a larger-than-life personality. And a report released Thursday confirms he was also an extravagant sexual predator, using his access to hospitals as a volunteer porter and fundraiser to abuse victims aged from 5 to 75. The review of Savile's behavior at 28 hospitals across the United Kingdom makes shocking reading, detailing a catalog of abuses against some of Britain's most vulnerable people over the course of decades. Protected by his celebrity and exploiting a network of relationships he built in hospitals, he carried out rapes, other sexual abuse and displayed an unhealthy interest in dead bodies in a hospital mortuary. Worse, the abuse went unchecked and unpunished, since the BBC entertainer died before the allegations against him were made public. UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologized in the House of Commons on Thursday to all the victims abused by Savile while in the care of the National Health Service -- and said the system had let down those who were brave enough to raise the alarm but had their complaints ignored. ""Savile was a callous, opportunistic, wicked predator who abused and raped individuals, many of them patients and young people, who expected and had a right to expect to be safe. His actions span five decades -- from the 1960s to 2010,"" Hunt said. ""The family favorite loved by millions courted popularity and used it to perpetrate and cover up his own evil acts."" Victims who complained were ""time and again"" ignored, or if heard, little or no action was taken, Hunt said. ""People and institutions turned a blind eye."" ""As a nation at that time we held Savile in our affection as a somewhat eccentric national treasure with a strong commitment to charitable causes,"" Hunt said. ""Today's reports show that in reality he was a sickening and prolific sexual abuser who repeatedly exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes."" Victims' ages from 5 to 75 . 'Abused and raped patients without scruple' For a generation who grew up watching Savile on TV's ""Top of the Pops"" and his children's program ""Jim'll Fix It,"" the revelations that first emerged in 2012 were deeply disturbing. Thursday's report into the full extent of his offending against children and adults, patients and staff, in 28 hospitals -- particularly Leeds Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital, a high-security psychiatric institution -- will do nothing to reassure them. The Leeds Infirmary report reveals a sexual predator who, while volunteering as a porter, ""abused and raped patients without scruple,"" said Hunt. Some 60 people reported abuse to the Leeds investigation, including a teenager who believed she was pregnant as a result of Savile's actions, he said. ""Two witnesses told the investigation Savile claimed to have had jewellery made from glass eyes taken from bodies in the mortuary,"" Hunt added, saying that other claims were too horrific to recount in parliament. The report cites one witness who tells how Savile recounted making trips to the hospital mortuary, where he claimed to have manipulated bodies before rigor mortis set in, taken photographs and performed sex acts on them. The report's authors say they have ""no way of proving Savile's claim that he interfered with the bodies of deceased patients in the mortuary."" However, it is established that he ""publicly declared his interest in the dead,"" that he visited a friend who worked in the mortuary and that controls were lax for many years. ""In light of the claims about the glass eye jewellery and Savile's interference with the bodies of the deceased, it is evident his interest in the mortuary was not within accepted boundaries,"" it concludes. 'Very manipulative' The report from Broadmoor said 10 people had alleged they were sexually assaulted by Savile, plus a case of indecent exposure involving a minor. The investigation concluded that at least five people were sexually abused and a sixth was more likely than not to have been. Five other victims could not be contacted for detailed accounts. The report gives an insight into how Savile was able to gain a position of influence at the secure institution that included giving him keys to wards and allowing him to watch female patients undress to bathe. ""Savile could be charming and persuasive, at least to some, but at the same time he was grandiose, narcissistic, arrogant and lacking any empathy,"" it states. ""He was also very manipulative, and many staff were convinced that he had close connections in high places and had the power to have them dismissed."" Una O'Brien, permanent secretary of the Department of Health, said in a statement that ""inadequate processes"" had allowed Savile to gain the position of authority at Broadmoor that aided his abusive behavior. ""While much has changed in the intervening years we will leave no stone unturned to make sure such appalling actions can never be repeated; our thoughts today are with the people who suffered and continue to suffer from these terrible crimes,"" she said. The UK's NSPCC children's charity said more must be done to safeguard children and ensure that an apparent ""culture of turning a blind eye"" to abuse is not repeated. ""To hear that some hospital staff may have actively facilitated Savile's abuse of children is sickening and takes the scandal of his crimes to yet another abhorrent level,"" said Peter Watt, national services director for the charity. ""Savile escaped justice because people didn't want to hear or believe what children were saying. Ministers now need to be satisfied that this could never happen again and that children and vulnerable adults in hospitals or any government facility are safe today."" Savile died in October 2011 at age 84, soon after being treated in a hospital for pneumonia. His long history of abuse emerged only a year later, thanks to a TV documentary by UK broadcaster ITV. The BBC, where he worked as a radio DJ and TV presenter, has set up a separate inquiry into abuses he carried out on BBC premises. CNN's Carol Jordan and Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.","28 hospitals release reports into abuse by Jimmy Savile of patients and staff .

"(CNN) -- A New Zealand gas station owner who became an overnight millionaire after a banking error, and later an international fugitive, has pleaded guilty to seven counts of theft. Nicknamed the ""accidental millionaire,"" Hui ""Leo"" Gao made headlines three years ago after he and his girlfriend fled the country when he accidentally received access to $10 million New Zealand dollars (U.S.$7 million). He is scheduled to be sentenced on August 24. Gao and his girlfriend withdrew $6.8 million and transferred them to overeseas accounts in Hong Kong, China and the Wynn casino in Macau, according to court documents. Gao has not made any statements to the New Zealand Police. His journey from a BP service station owner to a runaway millionaire began in 2009. In April of that year, Gao applied for overdraft financing for the gas station he co-owned with his mother in Rotorua, New Zealand, according to court records. The bank, Westpac approved his application with a $100,000 limit. But a clerical error by the bank's employee placed the limit as $10 million -- 100 times the intended amount. The next day, Gao discovered the error in his bank account and told his girlfriend, Kara Hurring that he was ""fâ€”ing rich"" and had millions of dollars, according to court documents. After transferring money to overseas accounts in the names of his mother, his girlfriend and himself, Gao fled to Hong Kong in April 2009. Hurring joined him there in May. By May 4, the bank became aware of the error and alerted authorities. A global manhunt, which included Interpol, focused on finding the accidental millionaires. After two and a half years on the run, Gao was arrested in Hong Kong in September 2011, and extradited to New Zealand in December. Hurring returned to the country voluntarily in February 2011. She has been found guilty of 28 counts of theft and two counts of money laundering, court records show. She denied knowing where the money came from, reported TVNZ, CNN's affiliate. Westpac, the Australian bank, recovered about $2.9 million from the couple's New Zealand accounts, but has yet to recoup the remaining $3.8 million. Reparations totaling that amount are sought by Westpac, according to court documents. The bank had no comment.

"(CNN) -- On Saturday and Sunday in Oklahoma, there were seven earthquakes. You read that right. Not tornadoes. Earthquakes. The most severe temblor registered 4.3 near Langston, the U.S. Geological Survey site showed, delivering a rumble to Logan County, north of Oklahoma City, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There were no reports of damage or major injury on Saturday, Oklahoma City news station News9 reported. The three earthquakes that happened Sunday occurred near Langston, CNN affiliate KOCO reported, one registering 4.0. The station is covering Sunday's temblors as a developing story. Track the USGS's earthquake report list . Damage and injury are far more likely with quakes that register 4.0 and higher, the USGS reports. The temblors seem to be part of a trend in the state. As of last month, Oklahoma had surpassed California in the number of earthquakes. From 1978 to 2008, Oklahoma was hit with an average of just two quakes of 3.0 magnitude of greater. As of June 19, 2014, there were 207 such quakes recorded in the state, the USGS said. An increase began in 2009 when 20 quakes of 3.0 magnitude or higher occurred, followed by 43 the next year and increasing every year except for 2012. As of June 16, 2014, California had recorded about 140 quakes of 3.0-magnitude or greater, compared with Oklahoma's 207. ""Earthquakes are going to be a normal part of everyday life in Oklahoma,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""They are going to become more and more a part of life there."" Oklahoma out-quakes California in 2014 . The four quakes that struck Saturday were relatively shallow, happening 5 miles or less from the surface, Myers notes. Larger earthquakes, such as the ones that happen in California, generally go much deeper, sometimes 50 miles deep. The Oklahoma quakes were strong enough to knock dishes off shelves and cause cracks in foundations but not enough to knock down buildings, Myers said. The Oklahoma Geographical Survey said it had stepped up the number of monitoring stations in the state, operating a network of 15 permanent stations and 17 temporary stations. Along with the USGS, the state geographical survey is researching to determine why earthquakes are happening more frequently. It's possible that hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, could have played a role in causing temblors, but there's no way to be sure until the USGS files its findings, Myers said. It does that once a month. Fracking is controversial and has split public opinion. CNN explored the process in-depth in an August 2013 special. In short, fracking works like this: A well is typically drilled between 5,000 to 20,000 feet into the earth's crust, then turns 90 degrees and continues horizontally for several thousand feet to where shale containing natural gas is believed to be. A mix of water, sand and chemicals is pumped at high pressure into the well to create long, narrow cracks or openings in the earth through which gas can escape. The sand particles keep the fissures open, allowing for natural gas to escape from the shale and flow into the well. The gas, along with the waste water, is drawn back up the well to the surface, where it is processed, refined and shipped. Wastewater injection could be behind the increase in the number of quakes recorded in Oklahoma, USGS geophysicist Rob Williams told CNN. Could a larger earthquake happen in the state? ""Given the rate of earthquakes over the last six months,"" Williams said, ""it's concerning enough to be worried about a larger, damaging earthquake happening."" What to know about earthquakes .

"Cairo (CNN) -- The funeral for Omar Suleiman, Egypt's former spy chief, took place amid tight security Saturday, attended by several thousand mourners, politicians, religious scholars and military leaders. Suleiman succumbed Thursday to complications from amyloidosis, a disease that affects multiple organs, including the heart and kidneys, according to the Cleveland Clinic in the United States, where the 76-year-old died. Suleiman's body, flown by private jet from the United States, arrived at the VIP terminal in the Cairo Airport at dawn Saturday. Several dozen supporters wearing black T-shirts waited outside the terminal carrying the Egyptian flag. They chanted slogans denouncing Israel and the United States. The ceremony coincided with the second day of Ramadan. The military funeral began with prayers at the Al Rashadan mosque in Nasr City in eastern Cairo. Suleiman's coffin, wrapped in the Egyptian flag, was borne on a horse-drawn carriage through the streets, accompanied by a marching band to the Madinet Nasr Cemetery. Military police wearing red berets carried his coffin past screaming mourners carrying posters of Suleiman and chanting denouncements of the newly elected president, Mohamed Morsy, and the Muslim Brotherhood. Morsy spent six months behind bars during Suleiman's tenure as head of intelligence. Morsy delegated his grand chamberlain and Brig. Gen. Abdul-Monem Foda as his representatives. Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa and a delegation from Al-Azhar, Egypt's highest Islamic institution, also were present, as were Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), and his chief of staff, Sami Anan. Suleiman was briefly appointed vice president under President Hosni Mubarak during the uprising that toppled the longtime Egyptian leader last year. It was Suleiman who, in February 2011, announced Mubarak's resignation and declared that SCAF would run the country's affairs. Suleiman's death came as a surprise to Egyptians. He had entered the race for Egypt's first democratically elected president in the eleventh hour, but failed to gather enough signatures to be on the ballot. He was disqualified by a panel that included members connected with the Mubarak regime, suggesting the move was not politically motivated. Suleiman had headed Egypt's intelligence since 1993, maintained close ties with the CIA, and was often criticized by human rights groups for his heavy-handed approach with suspected militants. Born into poverty in the town of Qena, he enrolled in Egypt's prestigious military academy and was decorated for his performance in the wars against Israel in 1967 and 1973. In June 1995, both Suleiman and Mubarak survived an assassination attempt during an African summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Suleiman was credited for saving Mubarak's life that day. A divisive figure in Mubarak's regime, during the revolution Suleiman led negotiations with various pro-change groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood. His stance was mainly to end the ""Million Man"" protest in Tahrir Square and create a ""reform"" package or else face a military coup. When asked by a CNN correspondent what he wanted from the protesters during the 18-day uprising that toppled Mubarak, he replied, ""Go home."" In an interview with a Western news channel last year, Suleiman remarked, ""Egyptians are not ready for democracy.""","Omar Suleiman received a military funeral in Cairo on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- How did this happen? That is what many people were asking Wednesday, after news broke that a health care worker had flown commercially at a time she was supposedly monitoring herself for a possible Ebola infection.

"(CNN) -- Fidel Castro told a visiting American journalist that the ""Cuban model"" no longer works, an apparent admission of failings in the communist economic model introduced by his revolution more than 50 years ago. ""The Cuban model doesn't even work for us anymore,"" Castro told Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic in an interview last week. Goldberg published parts of the exchange on a blog Tuesday and Wednesday. Castro's younger brother and successor, President Raul Castro, has said as much in numerous speeches since taking the reins of power in 2006. More recently, he said that a full fifth of state jobs could be redundant and that the government would have to review its role in the country's economy. A few small changes have already been introduced: allowing more private enterprise for farmers and barbers, for example. Goldberg said that Castro's statement was in response to a question about whether the Cuban model was still worth exporting. ""Did the leader of the Revolution just say, in essence, 'Never mind?' "" Goldberg wrote. The comments come amid speculation that the two brothers are divided on the economic issue and that Fidel Castro might not wholly support Raul's changes. Fidel Castro has studiously avoided domestic topics in his many public appearances over the last couple of months.

"(CNN) -- In today's publishing market, ""Going Rogue"" is a fat book at 432 pages, at a high price point of $28.99, with a massive (rumored 1.5 million) first printing, launched on the book world's version of a Royal Tour, where Oprah is Queen of the Universe and Barbara Walters is Duchess of the D.C.-Manhattan cognoscenti. In today's political market, well before it was officially released, ""Going Rogue"" was reduced to a pinprick-sized, petty insiders squabble. How do we square these disparate perspectives? As a person with alternating publisher and political hats, who knows the players but wasn't inside the John McCain campaign, who cares deeply about the current conservative movement and the future of the country (which are inextricably intertwined), may I offer a few thoughts to the friends on CNN.com's site? The publishing ""frenzy"" Full disclosure: Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon and Schuster, (for which I serve as editor-in-chief, a misnomer of a title, since my editing is confined to reading; for you political types, think, ""operative/organizer"") would have loved to acquire Sarah Palin's book. She didn't really shop it and it's not certain we would have paid what she was reputed to have commanded, but upon notice she was considering writing, we, like the rest of the book world, were in a frenzy at the prospect of publishing it. Many were prepared to offer Palin's lawyer, Bob Barnett, their first-born male child for it. We are now all watching very closely how it plays out (and more precisely, ""earns-out"") in a book market that's unpredictable and fickle always, but in major transition today. The pre-orders immediately kicked it onto the best-seller lists, but a dirty little secret of publishing (where spin is as prevalent as in politics) is not all best-sellers earn out (i.e., the publisher sells enough books to cover an author's advance, which is the threshold for making a profit). ""Going Rogue"" will now be a ""comp"" (or baseline) for assessing the value of and advances for political ""big books,"" so all you big book writers of the future better hope it sells big -- or your future advances won't be. ""The Political Palin"" On to politics. While having your own title is now de rigueur for politicians and policy makers, and the upshot is usually no harm-no foul, the goals of the publishing and political worlds are not always in tandem. Though there is much, much more in Palin's book that fleshes out her inner core, her grounding in faith and family, as well as her policy achievements and forward-thinking philosophical framework of common sense conservatism, so far the coverage of it has constrained her in a defensive backward-focused box, re-litigating the darkest days of the campaign and reliving difficult family moments. Though all the breathless chatter about 2012 is premature, the way Palin lays out her world view throughout the book and especially in the eloquent closing pages is sure to attract conservatives yearning for an unapologetic articulation of first principles. But because of the inordinate mainstream media focus on the political insiders' tiff, the Political Palin is getting sucked down and mucked up by the Published Palin. Listening to her on Rush Limbaugh as I write, she is digging out of the box her detractors would like to bury her in for once and all and needs to keep on it: Get off their message and onto her own. Now, for a point of personal privilege. I have been and will continue to be an advocate of Sarah Palin and her principles. Had I been asked about how to use her publishing opportunity to maximum political benefit, I would have proffered to Palin the received wisdom of the unlikely duet of my mother and Lee Atwater: Never burn bridges. As campaign memoirs go, ""Going Rogue"" napalms bridges, incinerates detractors, hoses gas on what were smoldering embers. It is without refutation anywhere, even among rabid Palin haters, that she received political hazing of a magnitude previously unimaginable. More mother wisdom: Two wrongs don't make a right (to which my Obama-loving daughter always replies, ""Yes, but three rights make a left""). There was a way to defend her honor, make her case, pivot to the future while showcasing her moral foundation by doing unto others as she wished they had done unto her, so to speak. Campaign pressure cooker . Anyone who has ever been in the Defcon One pressure cooker of a national campaign knows that ""mistakes are made,"" feelings are hurt, tempers are short, bitching is background noise. There is no such thing as Emily Post for political campaigns. Except for maybe Poppy Bush, good manners do not exist on any campaign planet. For good reason: They take time. Time is the most valuable commodity on a campaign and you just can't waste it thinking about how to choose your words carefully or get your job done more diplomatically. If someone isn't in tears every day, that day wasn't all it could be advancing the campaign. I once witnessed an experienced (big) man slap a professional female colleague across the face over an ad buy... and no one thought anything of it, starting with the woman. In fact, she would have been insulted if anyone told her she should have been insulted. Though the two primary Palin antagonists, McCain campaign senior strategists Steve Schmidt and Nicolle Wallace, have said little about the Molotov cocktails thrown at them in ""Going Rogue"" (other than a true Schmidt, aka, ""The Bullet,"" retort, ""Why are the bald guys always the villains?""), both have made it clear the accounts of their actions in ""Going Rogue"" are ""fiction."" And while I wasn't there, I have worked with and adore them both. They are uniquely talented, cool under fire, cutting-edge creative professionals, admired and respected by their peers of all political persuasions and their many high-level bosses. And ironically, however it ended, the relationship began as a match made in heaven. Both Steve and Nicolle were ecstatic with Palin's selection as vice presidential nominee; and both were appalled at the outrageous, unspeakable, unparalleled media treatment heaped on Palin and her family. Steve, normally the toughest guy in the room, called me at home on multiple occasions, just flabbergasted and flummoxed about how to protect Palin and her family and, of course keep the campaign on track. He was in genuine pain for her -- not a good state of mind or use of energy for the campaign guru, which he knew -- but he devoted much concentration to the astounding set of circumstances. Ditto for Nicolle. That Palin recalls her experience with them so negatively and ugly incidents so vividly does not make her a liar, as people with neither her nor the party's best interests in mind have charged. The operating principle of campaigns, perception is reality, works inside as well as outside. Once her perception of reality locked in negatively, particularly on Schmidt and Wallace, there was only one prism through which all their actions flowed. And it wasn't pretty. I have seen this phenomenon on countless campaigns and in the White House. It is unavoidable in any operation that is always under stress, where clearing-the-air sessions aren't possible given time or physical constraints. That campaign people tend to be uncommonly focused, which can come off as insensitive, might exaggerate the perception, but it is just an occupational hazard. The plight of the number two . Another common source of campaign discomfort is the role of the VPOTUS (that's vice president of the United States) candidate. It is always secondary to the POTUS in every respect. His/her operation is always subservient to the principal one. They do not set strategy or adjust message; they are assigned to B markets. They are an echo chamber. They do not give unique speeches unless they are given a specific and pointed attack, which might appear unseemly coming from the principal. Granted, Palin was a unique nominee, with uncommon charisma and fire-power, but number two is number two. It was ever thus and will ever be. Adjusting to being number two, after being number one (as a governor) is a process. Even if you were never number one, it is a trial -- witness Joe Biden, in perpetual adjustment mode. Bottom line: The book is a good read, an unusually detailed front-row seat view to how strained campaigns always are, and a compelling insight into Palin's perspective. Its long-term publishing and political impact are unknown for now, though as Palin moves out of the mainstream media monster publicity machine and into more hospitable, relevant political terrain, the prospects for success on both fronts improve exponentially. But its impact on personal and professional relationships is a sad one indeed and one I hope conservatives don't let it divide us just when we are marching toward a promising midterm, which reflects an ascendant common-sense conservatism and requires all the good guys in the foxhole together.

"New York (CNN) -- A New York judge has upheld a nearly 15-year-old murder conviction despite a former judge's claim that his own racial bias caused him to wrongly convict the defendant, according to court documents. New York City Criminal Court Judge ShawnDya L. Simpson ruled Wednesday that there was no evidence that former New York Supreme Court Judge Frank Barbaro acted with bias toward the defendant when the verdict was rendered. The case was revisited after Barbaro, a longtime champion of civil rights, said he believed that he denied a fair trial to a white man who claimed he killed a black man in self-defense. In a bench trial in October 1999, Donald Kagan said he was acting in self-defense when he shot Wavell Wint, 23, during a confrontation at a Brooklyn movie theater 11 months before. ""The evidence demonstrates that Justice Barbaro applied considerable effort in his deliberations and issued a written decision,"" Simpson said in the decision. Simpson ruled that Barbaro's claims of bias and prejudice were ""mere afterthoughts or second guesses."" Simpson wrote that was it troubling that it took Barbaro 13 years to ""express his concern that he may have been biased and prejudice."" The verdict, she ruled, should only be vacated with ""compelling and credible evidence that the fact finder acted improperly as a matter of law."" On the issues of Kagan's proclaimed innocence, Simpson wrote that Kagan failed to meet his ""burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that he is actually innocent for the crimes he was convicted."" Barbaro, who is white, found Kagan guilty of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon. Kagan was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison, where he remains today. Testifying during a December hearing on a motion to set aside the conviction, the former judge said he was convinced at the time that the defendant who stood before him was a racist who wanted to kill a black person. As a result, Barbaro says, he ignored evidence that Kagan had acted out of fear and not hatred. Barbaro, now 86, said in an exclusive interview with CNN this year, ""I couldn't get out of my mind the look on the lawyer's face when I said I found him guilty. And the defendant on the stand, like he was pleading to me, 'It just happened, it just happened,' and that was sort of haunting me."" Barbaro told CNN on Thursday that he is very disappointed with Simpson's decision. ""I believe she made a terrible error,"" he said. ""I think the facts were so clear. Judge Simpson didn't give any credence to the fact that I said I made a mistake, and that's very disappointing. It's sad."" Kagan's lawyer, Richard Mischel, said he plans to appeal Simpson's decision. ""We believe in the merits of the motion, and we're going to proceed with an appeal as far as necessary to vindicate Mr. Kagan's rights,"" he said. Mischel said that Kagan has a parole board hearing October 14 and that they plan to go ahead with the appeal, even if he is released. ""It's not just about getting him out of jail; it's about rectifying a wrong,"" Mischel said.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- More than a million anti-government youth gathered for protests in virtually all of Yemen's provinces, witnesses said Friday, a day the protesters dubbed ""Friday of victory from God."" The largest protest was in Taiz, where more than 500,000 went into Freedom Square, numerous eyewitnesses estimated. ""We will not stop marching and protesting. We feel that victory for the Yemeni revolution is near, and our patience will pay off very soon,"" said Mansoor al-Mukbili, a youth protester in Sanaa, the nation's capital. He said the regime is gasping its last breath and the protesters will continue seeking peaceful change and denounce any sort of violence. Fuad Himyari, the head of prayers in Sanaa's Change Square, called on youth protesters to stand firm, saying the battle against the oppressive regime is coming to an end. Pro-government protests were also witnessed in the capital as President Ali Abdullah Saleh's followers continue to gather, though in small numbers. More than 50,000 supporters showed up in Sabeen Square, 2 kilometers from the Presidential Palace. Pro-Saleh chants were repeated for more than two hours. ""Saleh, Saleh, we will defend you and support you,"" his supporters repeated. Protests demanding the ouster of Saleh have been going on for eight months. The ruling General People's Congress has been continuously urging dialogue. ""In the end the only way to solve the Yemeni crisis is through dialogue. We call opposition forces to the dialogue table,"" said Hasan al-Lawzi, the information minister. Abdu al-Ganadi, the deputy information minister, advised the opposition that Yemen is not Egypt and Tunisia, and that no one side will be able to solve the current crisis. ""We need to work together to rid the country from the political stalemate,"" he said. Opposition parties insist they will not be involved in any dialogue with the Saleh regime. ""The Gulf power transfer proposal was on the table for months and Saleh refused to sign it,"" said Ahmed Bahri, head of the political circle for the opposition Haq party. ""He was guaranteed immunity and we cannot guarantee he will get it in the end."" The proposal was put forward in May by the Gulf Cooperation Council, made up of six nations on the Arabian Peninsula. Saleh had initially indicated he would go along with it, but then refused to sign. In the southern Abyan province, government forces are gaining ground in the fight against suspected al Qaeda militants. The government said troops succeeded Thursday night in taking over al-Kod, a strategic town in the outskirts of Zinjibar, the capital of the province. The armed militants fled the town and are regrouping as government forces attempt to enter Zinjibar, officials said.","Witnesses say more than 500,000 protesters gather in Taiz .

"London (CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron said Friday protesters who resorted to violence  Thursday night will ""feel the full force of the law,"" and blamed them for wreaking havoc in London during the pre-Christmas weeks. Addressing reporters, Cameron defended the government's contentious move to triple tuiton at UK universities and said protesters, not the police, should be blamed for last night's chaos on Parliament street and nearby areas and for attacking a car transporting Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. ""I immediately rang the Prince of Wales,"" said Cameron, a reference to Prince Charles. ""We need to learn the lesson of this incident,"" he said. On Friday, police sifted through rubble strewn over London's Parliament square, searching for clues and culprits in Thursday night's protests, where students, enraged by the triple tuition hike, broke windows and ambushed the royal vehicle. ""It is not the fault of the police,"" said Cameron. ""It was the fault of those who tried to smash that car."" Members of the National Union of Students said in its website the group condemns any forms of violence, including from the police. ""Regarding many of the scenes that were witnessed yesterday, whilst it is clear that there were a small number of people involved who were inciting violence, many people were contained for a long period of time when attempting to take part in peaceful protest,"" the NUS stated. ""We are calling on the Metropolitan Police to have a full investigation into the clashes yesterday between protesters and the police and for it to look again at its tactics for policing demonstrations,"" it said. A photo of the royal couple, dressed in evening wear, made headlines as it showed the startled expressions on their faces as they sat in their Rolls-Royce before exiting for a Royal Variety Performance. The royal couple escaped unhurt. Police said the route had been cleared minutes before the royal couple was due to make their journey. The high-profile incident came late in a day of violent protests that left at least 12 officers and 43 demonstrators hurt. London's Metropolitan Police issued a statement Friday condemning the protests and alleged vandalism that took place Thursday night, claiming protesters intimidated Christmas shoppers and bystanders. ""This has nothing to do with peaceful protest,"" the statement said. ""Students are involved in wanton vandalism including smashing windows in Oxford and Regent streets."" So far, 34 people have been arrested in connection with the protests, and more than 40 protesters have been hospitalized, police said. The protests followed a vote in the House of Commons to approve a plan to raise the existing cap on tuition rates charged by universities from  £3,000 to £9,000 a year. In U.S. dollars, that's a nearly $10,000 a year increase -- from roughly $4,700 to $14,000. Lawmakers approved the plan in a 323-302 vote. The measure awaits approval by the House of Lords and a signature by the queen before it can become law. The vote ended hours of debate inside Parliament. Thousands of demonstrators outside said the plan will price many students out of a university education. Supporters say the tuition cap hike is needed to cut the government's massive deficit.","Prime Minister David Cameron says  protesters who resorted to violence will ""feel the full force of the law""

(CNN) -- The Republicans have made it clear where their focus is this week with their convention slogan, ""Country First."" With the abundance of flags, chants of  ""U.S.A., U.S.A."" and tributes to those in the military, they have been laying it on thick. Sen. John McCain has often talked about the need for Americans to dedicate themselves to service, namely military, and he is on the money. But a line of attack that was used consistently last night by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and later by Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, tried to call into question whether community organizers put their country first. Palin focused on the issue, mainly to criticize the Obama campaign for offering up his community organizing work opposite her experience as mayor. But when you examine Giuliani's dismissive tone -- and the subsequent laughter by the Republicans in the XCel Energy Center -- regarding the community organizer jabs, the Democrats could have an opening. After praising Palin's speech, I said as much, and that they can expect the Obama-Biden camp to seize on that point. This morning, I read an e-mail from Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, who incorporated the community organizer argument into a fundraising appeal. Republican operatives I talked to said the lines were brilliant and that community organizers don't play to the GOP's strength. I disagree. And so do the many folks who have sent me angry e-mails. They include white Republicans, black Democrats, people from Small Town, U.S.A., and Big City, America. At a time when Americans are losing their homes to foreclosure, folks are trying to get by after layoffs, people are struggling with lack of healthcare, and we're facing pressing environmental issues, it's ludicrous to slam the little man and woman who isn't asking the government for handouts, but is doing what they can to make their neighborhood and city better. I think of my parents. As a child growing up in the Clinton Park neighborhood in Houston, Texas, my parents were just regular folks trying to raise their five children (sounds like Gov. Sarah Palin). They were always present at our local elementary school (sounds like Gov. Sarah Palin) and were heavily involved in our church. But our neighborhood was dying. Drugs were ravaging it. Older homeowners were dying and their children didn't want to live there, so they began renting to people who really didn't care. We saw abandoned homes, weeded lots, no sidewalks, a park falling into disrepair, and a senior citizen center shuttered. So they joined several others neighbors and decided to form a civic club. Others called them crazy for trying to advance their ideas, but they didn't give up. They enlisted their children in passing out flyers and putting up signs, notifying folks of the monthly meetings. A few folks showed up, but they kept going. And going. And going. And going. After months, and then years, we began to see progress: Stepped up police patrols and crack houses raided by the Houston police, DEA and FBI. Abandoned houses torn down. Weeded lots cut. More heavy trash pickup days. New streetlights. New sidewalks. New sewer pipes. A refurbished park. Bottom line, these average, low- to middle-income people didn't have political power. They focused on people power. They organized a community to take action. iReport.com: Is Palin really ready to start an experience debate? So when Rudy Giuliani and Palin mock community organizers, they don't just toss a barb at Sen. Barack Obama, they demean Reginald and Emelda Martin. They degrade the women who fought for their rights. They disrespect the labor activists and immigrant worker activists like Cesar Chavez. They dismiss those in the civil rights movement -- folks from small town America who were sick and tired of being sick and tired. They thumb their noses at the Nelson Mandelas of the world who want a better life for their children. It would have been perfectly fine for Giuliani and Palin to say that Obama's community organizing days didn't amount to enough experience to be president. But when you openly laugh and mock those hard-working Americans who are in the trenches every day, then you really don't care about ""Country First"" or service. Will this be a major deal or a ripple? Likely the latter. But the one thing I know about community organizers is that they know how to organize communities. And if the McCain-Palin ticket wants to win, they best not slap those folks they need for voter registration drives and systems to get folks to the polls. Community organizers are always told they can't do something or are dismissed as meaningless. Yet they often have the last laugh. Rudy Giuliani, Sarah Palin and John McCain might want to remember that.

"(CNN) -- Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, inhabited by some 30 Bedouin tribes, has long been a lawless land that serves as a buffer between Egypt and Israel. But it is now drawing comparisons to the ungoverned tribal regions of Pakistan as networks of Bedouin tribes, Sinai's criminal elements and radical Islamists have begun to capitalize on Egypt's post-revolution security vacuum by increasingly engaging in drug and arms smuggling, human trafficking and terrorism. The escalating lawlessness in the Sinai risks turning the region into a powder keg. Egypt's domestic power struggle has implications for all nations in the region. Post-Arab Spring instability has increased Israel's concerns about its own security, concerns that will probably grow no matter who is in charge in Cairo. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I am concerned about the threat that Iran's nuclear program poses to Israel. However, instability in the Sinai is also a growing threat to Israel and Egypt's security. The Israel-Egypt peace treaty, which has provided security and balanced tensions in the region since 1978, is at risk. Human trafficking in the Sinai has become a human rights nightmare. While leading a congressional delegation visit to Israel and Egypt this summer, I learned about the steady and growing flow of African migrants from Eritrea, Sudan and Ethiopia who are desperate to get to Israel and Europe in search of economic opportunity. But these migrants are increasingly waylaid in the Sinai desert by Bedouin tribes, for whom hostage-taking has become a flourishing business. While a few years ago a migrant might be ransomed for $3,000, the going price today is more than 10 times that amount. Thousands of refugees are being held captive and subjected to torture, forced labor and rape, while those who cannot pay for their release are often murdered. The Sinai powder keg nearly exploded in August after Islamist militants in Sinai attacked near the southern Israeli city of Eilat, killing and wounding Israeli soldiers and civilians. While pursuing the attackers, Israeli forces killed several Egyptian security guards, which then sparked attacks on the Israeli Embassy in Cairo and led to Egyptian demands for an end to the peace treaty. Israel has stepped up its military deployment on its side of the border. We have also seen recent attacks on and abductions of members of the Multinational Force and Observers, whose important peacekeeping mission -- established by treaty protocol -- will be increasingly difficult to accomplish amid unraveling security on the peninsula. Recently, southern Israel has seen rocket attacks from the Sinai, as well as an attack by militants who crossed from the Sinai into Israel and opened fire on Israeli civilians. While Israel is building a barrier along part of the Sinai border, that cannot stop all attacks, and one deadly rocket fired from the Sinai could be enough to kill the peace treaty altogether and ignite a regional war. It is critical that we engage the Israelis and Egyptians in joint discussions on security in the Sinai and on preserving the Multinational Force and Observers' mission. The Egyptian military should be urged to reinforce checkpoints on the borders between mainland Egypt and the Sinai in order to stop the flow of arms and crack down on human trafficking. Egypt's new government must respect the country's commitments to combat human trafficking under international conventions as well as domestic law. Corruption is a big obstacle to these common-sense solutions. But a renewed focus on bolstering the long-term economic prospects of the peninsula could begin to address the underlying problems. Highlighting the Sinai's human rights horrors could also be a focus of the Obama administration's Atrocities Prevention Board, which is intended to encourage robust multilateral efforts to prevent and respond to atrocities, something that should bring all nations together. Ultimately, however, a new Egyptian government needs to understand that a lawless Sinai only undermines Egyptian interests. The administration must make clear to all in the region, but especially to the Egyptians, that they have a common interest in preserving the peace. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Udall.","Egypt's Sinai Peninsula is becoming more lawless, Sen. Mark Udall says .

"(CNN) -- Pennsylvania authorities say they arrested a former United Nations weapons inspector after he allegedly exchanged sexually explicit online messages with a police officer who was pretending to be a 15-year-old girl. Scott Ritter, the former top U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq, was arrested in November, months after police said he sent sexual messages to a police officer posing as a 15-year-old girl named Emily, the Barrett Township, Pennsylvania, Police Department said in a news release Thursday. Ritter's lawyer, Todd Henry, did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment about the arrest, which The Pocono Record first reported on Thursday. According to an affidavit of probable cause, ""delmar4fun"" contacted Barrett Township Detective Ryan Venneman -- who was posing as ""Emily,"" from Poconos, Pennsylvania -- in an online chat room on February 7, 2009, saying he was a 44-year-old man from Albany, New York. Ritter, 48, lives in Delmar, New York, according to police. Delmar is in Albany County. ""Delmar4fun,"" whom police identified as Ritter, sent ""Emily"" a link to his Web camera and then masturbated on camera and said he was fantasizing about having sex with her, the affidavit said. ""Emily"" told ""delmar4fun"" what her age was twice, the affidavit said. The second time, ""delmar4fun,"" turned the camera off and said he didn't realize he was speaking to a 15-year-old and didn't want to get into trouble, the affidavit said. However, Ritter allegedly later resent the camera link, and masturbated and ejaculated on camera, the affidavit said. Venneman called a phone number that ""delmar4fun"" had given, and told him that ""Emily"" was a police officer. ""Delmar4fun"" identified himself to Venneman, the affidavit said. Ritter was arrested on November 9, 2009, on a number of charges including indecent exposure, corruption of minors and criminal solicitation, according to the police news release. Ritter is free on $25,000 unsecured bail, according to the Barrett Township Police Department. Michael Rakaczewski, Monroe County, Pennsylvania, assistant district attorney, said Ritter could face up to seven years in prison if convicted. Ritter served from 1991 to 1998 as the chief United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq.","Former top U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq arrested in November, officials say .

"New York (CNN) -- Seventeen people were arrested in Philadelphia in a multimillion dollar drug bust, with the help of a member of one of the world's largest drug cartels, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office announced Wednesday. The city's Dangerous Drug Offenders Unit seized almost $3 million worth of cocaine in the bust, as well as 16 vehicles and five guns, after a three-month investigation. Authorities said they were tipped off in February by a confidential informant who said garages and auto body shops in the city were ""equipping vehicles with special compartments to traffic drugs."" The vehicles would pick up shipments of cocaine in New York and return them to Philadelphia, authorities said. The District Attorney's office said the arrests Wednesday are a direct result of a series of arrests in September 2011 by the Dangerous Drug Offenders Unit that involved members of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the largest drug cartels in the world, operating out of Sinaloa and Juarez, Mexico. Authorities said one of the defendants in those arrests became an informant for the unit and helped lead investigators to a garage, and subsequently other garages and auto body shops, involved in the drug ring. It is unclear if the informant who tipped the police off in February and the Sinaloa Cartel informant are the same person. ""Back in September we announced that we had effectively cut off the head of a dangerous and deadly monster before it ever had a chance of poisoning our streets,"" said District Attorney Seth Williams. ""Now thanks to those arrests, not only did we stop the Sinaloa Cartel from becoming a viable operation in Philadelphia, we have also shut down another drug ring that was trying to destroy our city."" The defendants range in age from early 20s to late 40s and include a married couple from Puerto Rico. Charges include criminal conspiracy, possession with the intent to deliver and unlawful use of a communication facility.","Sinaloa drug cartel informer leads to arrests, officials say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans are doomed in 2016 if they again nominate a candidate like Mitt Romney or John McCain, Sen. Ted Cruz said Thursday. Cruz, a tea party favorite who is considering a presidential bid, said his party needs to nominate a ""strong conservative"" to win back the White House in 2016. If not, Hillary Clinton will be president, he said in an interview on CNBC. When asked if former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is too far to the left to fit the conservative bill, the junior senator from Texas said he is a ""fan of Jeb Bush's"" but added that ""we need to learn from history."" ""We need to look to history and what works and what doesn't and the one thing is clear is if Republicans run another candidate in the mold of a Bob Dole, or a John McCain, or a Mitt Romney â€” and let me be clear, all three of those are good, honorable men.

""But if we run another candidate in the mold of a Bob Dole, or a John McCain, or Mitt Romney, we will end up with the same result, which is millions of people will stay home on Election Day."" ""And if we run another candidate like that, Hillary Clinton will be president,"" Cruz said. It's not the first time Cruz has criticized Dole, McCain and Romney's candidacies. Just this spring at the Conservative Political Action Conference Cruz pointed to the three former nominees as examples of ""when you don't stand and draw a clear distinction, when you don't stand for principle, Democrats celebrate."" Cruz drew fire from Dole and McCain for those remarks with Dole saying Cruz needed to ""check the record before passing judgment."" On Thursday Cruz stressed the urgency of straying from the ""mold"" of those three past nominees because ""there is an urgency. The states have never been higher."" ""I think eight more years down this road we risk doing irreparable damage to the greatest nation in the history of the world,"" Cruz said. Romney and his family have said it's unlikely he'll run in 2016, but it's not completely out of the question and Romney has repeatedly turned down opportunities to shut down voices in the party calling on him to run a third time for president.","CNBC asked Ted Cruz what he thought about rumors that Jeb Bush might run for president .

"(CNN) -- When Apple introduces new iPhones on Tuesday, as everyone expects them to do, the company that practically created the smartphone will face an unusual task: keeping up with the competition. There's still plenty to be said for the iPhone's sleek, simple design, easy-to-navigate operating system and tidy ""closed garden"" app environment. But as phones running Google's Android operating system, particularly Samsung's, have gained in popularity, iPhone owners have increasingly found themselves looking around and wondering, ""Why can't my phone do that?"" Many Android phones have bigger screens than the iPhone. Some are water-resistant and can even snap photos underwater. Android apps can update automatically. Users can control Motorola's new Moto X phone with their voice, without touching it. And that's just the beginning. Add to that the fact that many in the tech world saw the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 as incremental advances, not the seismic leaps forward we'd come to expect from Apple, and you've got the more pressure on the company to ramp up the ""wow!"" factor. ""The smartphone market is more competitive overall, and in the high-end it has become a duopoly between Samsung and Apple,"" said Carolina Milanesi, a consumer-technology researcher with Gartner Research. ""Many feel that Apple needs to regain the distance they once had over their competitors."" The iPhone has remained the world's top selling smartphone, save for a few quarters when it was dethroned by phones in Samsung's Galaxy S line. But after making up nearly 24% of all smartphones sold in late 2011, Apple's device is now down to about 14%, while Android phones account for a whopping 79%. The iPhone and iPad ""were revolutionary when they first came out, but (rival)products that are out there now are about as close to Apple's devices as they've ever been,"" Scott Kessler, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ, told CNNMoney. ""The question is whether Apple is going to introduce products that are different enough from their competitors."" So, what could we see come Tuesday? The most high-profile feature that's been rumored for the new iPhone is a fingerprint scanner. Such a security feature would let users register a finger or thumb print and use it to unlock their phone. There are reports the phone could be able to access LTE Advanced, a network that would make it faster than phones with 4G connections. That network is not yet available in many areas of the U.S., however. Apple reportedly also is looking at adding bigger display screens for the iPhone, but they would likely be for future models, not the phones coming this week. As usual, Apple is expected to upgrade the phone with a faster processor, better battery life and an improved camera. But those are the sort of pragmatic upgrades that, while arguably most important to user experience, don't turn heads the way a novelty like Siri, the iPhone 4S's voice-activated digital assistant, did in 2011. Milanesi says Apple needs something more than standard upgrades to get its mojo back. But that shot of adrenalin might arrive in an unconventional way. ""Apple needs a new 'hero product,' but I do not think it necessarily has to be a phone,"" she said. ""With technology innovation slowing down, maybe they are better off turning iPhone into a market-share grabber and showing innovation in another product."" The most likely candidate there could be the company's anticipated ""iWatch."" Apple is all but certain to be joining the emerging smartwatch market that Samsung entered last week with its Galaxy Gear device. If Apple blows away the competition with a watch that transcends the existing options (as well as those expected from Google and Microsoft), it could bring back some of the excitement that once met the unveiling of groundbreaking products like the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Opinions are split as to whether Apple will introduce a watch Tuesday. Apple typically doesn't launch other major products at iPhone events. But an iWatch rollout later this year or in early 2014 would miss at least some of the coveted holiday-shopping season while giving Samsung and other smartwatch makers a big head start in the marketplace. Then there's the long anticipated, but yet unseen, Apple TV set (as opposed to the Apple TV streaming device that already exists). Moving onto customer wrists, and into living rooms, might deflate pressure to sex up the iPhone. Still, it's hard to imagine a tech world in which the iPhone isn't seen as an elite device. That's why, when CEO Tim Cook takes the stage Tuesday in Cupertino, all eyes will be on him.","Apple is expected to introduce new iPhones on Tuesday .

Past two iPhone upgrades were viewed as incremental by some .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, voters across the country appeared to offer a rebuke to the administration of President Barack Obama by voting into office many Republicans, who now will control the Senate and the House of Representatives. Such a take-down in the second year of the second term of any President is not uncommon. But this is the first African-American president, a man swept into office twice with huge support from blacks. Does voters' midterm reaction to Obama indicate some flagging in support for him among people of color? Could the GOP be making inroads with black voters? Well, first consider: Last week Chris Rock hosted ""Saturday Night Live."" The show reprised a segment about blacks and President Obama called: How's he doing? The bit had an all-black panel, and after a few moments the discussion turned to the following question: What would it take for Barack Obama to lose the black vote? Spoiler alert: There is no way for him to do that. It was just a comedy skit, but seems to be true in real life; some may wonder why. After all, the unemployment rate for blacks remains high. In September the unemployment rate for whites was 4.9%, while for blacks it was more than double that, at 10.8%. The racial wealth gap also remains high. What is less well-known is that when you control for family income, black median wealth is less than one-third of white median wealth. Put another way, at every income level, blacks only have a fraction of the wealth that similarly situated whites have. From a financial perspective, things are not good for many blacks when compared with their white peers -- in spite of there being a black President. Nevertheless, there is widespread support of the President among blacks. So far, the Republican Party has given black voters little reason to shift its way, and Republicans should not assume that black support will simply move to their side if they merely put forth a black candidate. A few of the reasons why: Republican-controlled state legislatures that enacted voter-ID laws, coupled with Republican positions on affirmative action and immigration, are outside of the views held by most of the black community. But to be sure, black support for President Obama has eroded. Obama's favorability rating is down 9 percentage points from the beginning of the year and stands at 85%. His favorability among whites has remained unchanged at 34%. But black support is double that of whites. Why? Is it because blacks always support blacks? Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas would say that can't be true, and tell that to the blacks who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2008 primaries. No, I suspect it's because we have empathy for the situation Obama finds himself in. He isn't even safe in his own home, for heaven's sake. To quote Chris Rock from the ""SNL"" segment: ""Run into R Kelly's lawn and see what happens."" What most blacks have in common with President Obama, is well -- we're black. We've all been disrespected at work (remember ""You lie!"" from Rep. Joe Wilson). We've all been presumed incompetent: ""Why is the President's response to Ebola so weak?"" Here's why: Because the Republicans will not confirm his nominee for surgeon general. That is not President Obama's fault -- even though he receives the blame. Last year, a CNBC poll showed that when you polled the term ""Obamacare"" you received a different response than when you polled the term ""Affordable Care Act"": 46% of the group asked about Obamacare opposed it, while 37% asked about the Affordable Care Act opposed it. It is not the President's fault that when some voters hear his name associated with something they are more likely to reflexively oppose it. Who doesn't remember the ""Keep the government out of my Medicare"" signs when the Affordable Care Act was being debated in town hall meetings across the country? Uh. ... You almost didn't have the heart to tell them that Medicare is a government program. Early reports show that indeed Obama has not lost black support in the voting booth. About 90% of blacks voted Democratic in the 2014 midterm elections, roughly where they voted in 2012 and 2010. A high percentage of black voters will likely always support this President. His experiences are like our experiences. He may be the President, but ... he's ... still ... black like us. But the midterms do not bode well for the Democrats in 2016. Republicans could not put enough images of President Obama in their election ads, and many Democrats could not run away from the President fast enough. My favorite was Kentucky Senate hopeful Alison Lundergan Grimes refusing to say whether she even voted for President Obama. She lost anyway. Contrast her response with that of a senator from Kentucky -- Rand Paul -- a presidential aspirant who stated, at a Detroit GOP field office in an African-American neighborhood, that the ""Republican Party brand sucks, and so people don't want to be a Republican and for 80 years, African-Americans have had nothing to do with Republicans."" In 2016 when President Obama is no longer at the top of the ticket helping to get out the black vote out, Democrats will have a different problem. If they lose, maybe they will blame that on President Obama as well.","Dorothy Brown: Did voters' apparent rebuke of Dems extend to blacks support?
She says blacks still fair poorly on employment, wealth, but they still back Obama over GOP .
She says they identify with what he's faced: disrespect, blame, stonewalling .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey's prime minister says the country will follow aid ships to Gaza in an effort to stop incidents like last year's raid by Israeli commandos that killed eight Turks and one Turkish-American. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Al Jazeera television network Thursday that ""Turkish warships are primarily responsible to protect our ships that carry humanitarian aid to Gaza. From now on, we will not allow these ships to be subjected to attacks from Israel similar to what happened with the Freedom Flotilla. ... Israel will be answered appropriately."" The tough talk from Erdogan comes during an escalation of tensions between Israel and Turkey. On Wednesday, Israeli officials said Turkey had expelled three diplomats from the Israeli Embassy in Ankara. A day earlier, Erdogan compared Ankara's once-close ally in the Middle East to a ""spoiled boy"" and announced additional sanctions would soon be imposed, according to the semi-official Anatolian agency. The Israeli government has not yet commented publicly on the remarks made by Erdogan to Al Jazeera. Israeli government officials told CNN that many ideas on a possible response to Turkey's statements were being discussed but that nothing definite had been decided on. Dan Meridor, Israel's minister of intelligence and atomic energy, said on Israeli army radio Friday: ""Turkey said that Israel is not above international law, she needs to understand that she is not either."" He added: ""In accordance with Turkey, an international committee was appointed by the U.N., and it determined that the blockade on Gaza is legal."" Speaking Wednesday at a naval academy event, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took a more conciliatory tone, saying the recent increase in tensions with Turkey ""was not our choice then, and it is not our choice now."" But, he added, Israel has the right to defend its coast and to prevent smugglers and flotillas reaching the Gaza Strip. Turkey declared last week it was downgrading relations with Israel, suspending all military agreements between the two countries and giving the three senior Israeli diplomats less than a week to leave Turkish territory. Erdogan's government is incensed that Israel refuses to apologize or pay compensation for those killed in the flotilla incident in May of last year. The humanitarian workers and activists were shot dead by Israeli commandos in a botched raid on an aid convoy that was trying to break Israel's sea blockade of Gaza. The blockade was imposed, according to the Israeli military, to prevent the smuggling of weapons to the Hamas-ruled coastal enclave. A United Nations investigation into the violent maritime event released a week ago found that the Israeli blockade of Gaza is a ""legitimate security measure"" in compliance with international law, but it said that Israel had used ""excessive and unreasonable"" force in the takeover of the ship. Israel insists that its soldiers acted in self-defense after being assaulted by the Turkish activists. Turkey and Israel have been negotiating for months in an attempt to improve their faltering relationship, but those efforts have failed. The release of the U.N. report was delayed while those negotiations continued. CNN's Ivan Watson, Kevin Flower, Guy Azriel and Yesim Comert contributed to this report.","NEW: Israeli government officials say a possible response is being discussed .

"Soma, Turkey (CNN) -- The image of an aide to Turkey's Prime Minister kicking a man protesting the mine disaster that has claimed nearly 300 lives has prompted outrage -- and has become a symbol of the anger felt against the government. The incident occurred as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the western city of Soma a day after the devastating mine fire. The man, detained by special forces, can be seen lying on the ground as the suited adviser to Erdogan, identified as Yusuf Yerkel by Turkish media and CNN Turk, aims a kick at him. The shocking image outraged many in Turkey, prompting an outpouring of anger on social media, and is seen as symbolizing the increasingly polarizing impact of Erdogan's authority on the country. It's been nearly a year since anti-government protests first roiled Istanbul, prompting a response from authorities that was widely criticized as heavy-handed. Yerkel was quoted by Turkey's semi-official Anadolu news agency as saying that he had been deeply saddened by Wednesday's events. ""I am sad that I could not keep my calm in the face of all the provocation, insults, and attacks that I was subjected to that day,"" he reportedly said. Besides the anger prompted by the photo, Erdogan's speech Wednesday to relatives of dead and injured miners was seen as insensitive and drew scathing criticism. As public anger mounted through the evening, hundreds took to the streets in anti-government protests in Istanbul and Ankara, with police answering, in some cases, with water cannons and tear gas. In Ankara, the nation's capital, some left black coffins in front of the Energy Ministry and the Labor and Social Security ministry buildings. Meanwhile, unions called for strikes across the country on Thursday. At the mine, where what has become more of a recovery effort than a rescue continued, the mood was sullen, but there was little sign of the burning anger seen elsewhere over the accident. Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said the number of coal miners confirmed dead had risen by one to 283, as of Thursday evening. Three injured miners remain in the hospital, he said. The recovery operation is expected to continue overnight and into Friday. A 'sorrow for the whole Turkish nation' President Abdullah Gul offered words of comfort as he visited the western city, a day after his premier attracted public ire. The mine fire is a ""sorrow for the whole Turkish nation,"" Gul told reporters, and he offered his condolences to the victims' families. Onlookers listened silently until a man interrupted Gul with shouts: ""Please, President! Help us, please!"" An investigation into the disaster has begun, Gul said, adding that he was sure this would ""shed light"" on what regulations are needed. ""Whatever is necessary will be done,"" he said. He commended mining as a precious profession. ""There's no doubt that mining and working ... to earn your bread underground perhaps is the most sacred"" of undertakings, he told reporters. Gul had entered the mine site with an entourage of many dozens of people -- mostly men in dark suits -- walking through a crowd of rescue workers who were standing behind loosely assembled police barricades. Rescue and recovery workers retrieved more bodies Thursday from the still smoldering coal mine. Resignation marked the workers' faces after they had stood and sat outside the mine for hours, idle and waiting. Some of them passed the time talking on cell phones, others smoking or taking off their hard hats and burying their faces in their hands. With hope of finding survivors nearly gone, it appeared there was little they could do. Funerals amid grief . Smoke and fumes are hindering efforts to reach more of those still missing below the surface and lessen the chances that any more will be found alive, even in special ""safe"" chambers equipped with oxygen and other supplies. Fourteen bodies were found in one such chamber. More than a day has passed since anyone was pulled out alive. Rescuers saved at least 88 miners in the frantic moments after a power transformer blew up Tuesday during a shift change at the mine, sparking a choking fire deep inside. Since then, the bodies of nearly 200 miners who were trapped in the burning shaft nearly a mile underground have been returned to their families. ""Enough, for the life for me!"" yelled one woman -- her arms flailing, tears running down her cheeks. ""Let this mine take my life, too!"" Funerals took place Thursday in a community stricken with grief. Autopsies on dozens of bodies revealed the miners died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Erdogan said Wednesday that as many as 120 more were trapped inside the mine, though that was before rescue crews grimly hurried a series of stretchers -- at least some clearly carrying corpses -- past the waiting crowd. In his much-criticized speech to the relatives of the dead and injured, the Prime Minister glossed over the issue of mine safety, describing the carnage they had suffered as par for the course in their dangerous business. Apparently on the defensive, he rattled off a string of horrible past accidents, even going back to an example from 19th-century Britain. As he took a stroll through the city, onlookers showered him with deafening jeers as well as chants of ""Resign, Prime Minister!"" Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu defended the government's response and Erdogan during an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday. ""All the efforts will be done to check what was wrong, if there was anything wrong during this disaster or before,"" he said, stressing the country's standards are ""quite high."" About Erdogan, Davutoglu said: ""He was feeling all these pains in his heart. Everybody knows that our Prime Minister is always with the people, and always feels the pain of the people. Otherwise, he wouldn't get such a high support in eight elections in (the) last 10 years."" Scathing engineers' accusations . A group of engineers investigating the cause of the inferno made a scandalous accusation. ""WHAT HAPPENED IN SOMA IS NOT FATE, IT IS MURDER,"" a local branch of the Chamber of Electrical Engineers wrote in all capital letters at the top of its official statement Wednesday. Although the group is not known for any party affiliation and comprises serious experts, such barbs have become common in a country riven with political division, where street protests and water cannons have become a familiar sight. The statement also reflects the anguish that has shaken Turkey after what looks to be the deadliest mine disaster in its history. The latest death toll already tops a mining accident in the 1990s that took 260 lives. The chamber of electricians also contradicted the official version of how the fire started, saying: ""The fire was not caused by an electrical situation as presented to the public in the first statements."" The assessment from inspectors from the chamber's local branch in Izmir on what happened suggests negligence may have played a part. ""The inspection revealed that the systems to sense poisonous and explosive gases in the mine and the systems to manage the air systems were insufficient and old,"" they said. The blaze started as a ""coal fire"" at 700 meters deep, and then air fans pushed the flames and smoke farther through the mine, the chamber concluded. The ventilation was not corrected until ""much later."" The miners were trapped and inundated with smoke and fire. Soma's public prosecutor's office has started an investigation of its own into the fire, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency reported. Political bonfire . The chamber's accusations land on top of those already heaped on Erdogan's government by his political opponents. Opposition politician Ozgur Ozel from the Manisa region, which includes Soma, filed a proposal in late April to investigate Turkish mines after repeated deadly accidents. He has said that he is sick of going to funerals for miners in his district. Several dozen members of opposition parties signed on to his proposal, but Erdogan's conservative government overturned it. Some of its members publicly lampooned it, an opposition spokesman said. The mine, owned by SOMA Komur Isletmeleri A.S., underwent regular inspections in the past three years, two of them this March, Turkey's government said. Inspectors reported no violation of health and safety laws. Waiting on dead friends . For Veysel Sengul, a miner waiting by the mine's entrance for more of his friends to emerge, the mourning may go on much longer than the three days of official grieving ordered by Erdogan. After what's happened, he said, he'll never work in a mine again. Rescuers haven't given up hope that some miners reached emergency chambers stocked with gas masks and air and could still be alive. But Yildiz, the energy minister, said ""hopes are diminishing"" of rescuing anyone yet inside the mine. Sengul has already given up. The miner knows that at least four of his friends are dead.

"Washington (CNN) -- Occupy DC demonstrators spent Sunday afternoon discussing how to respond to a call by the National Park Service to stop camping overnight at sites a few blocks from the White House. The park service notified protesters on Friday that they ""may be subject to arrest and their property subject to seizure as evidence"" if there are evident ""camping violations"" by around noon Monday. The notice for those in McPherson Square and nearby Freedom Plaza said that to comply with the federal agency's camping regulations, demonstrators must remove all camping material from the sites and leave one side of all temporary structures open at all times. Authorities describe the purpose of the order as necessary to ensure public health and safety. Oakland cleans up after ""Occupy"" clash . Video posted online from early Sunday showed a man appearing to walk away from U.S. Park Police members as he yelled out, ""I have done nothing wrong."" Two officers tried to grab him before a third officer used a stun gun on the man, who was then handcuffed. A CNN crew witnessed the arrest, which protesters said came after the man went from tent to tent removing notices posted by the National Park Service. There was no immediate comment from park police on the incident, including whether the man was charged. Later in the day, a small group of protesters met for about three hours under the statue of Civil War hero Maj. Gen. James McPherson, which is in the middle of the park. A protester named Eli -- who would only give his first name, and who wasn't participating in the meeting -- said one of the ideas being mulled if Monday's deadline were imposed would be to hold a ""sleep strike,"" in which demonstrators would play board games and do other things throughout the nights to avoid the ""sleeping activities"" banned by the Park Service. ""I plan on not leaving and not sleeping as long as possible,"" Eli said. Pastor Brian Merritt of Washington's Palisades Community Church said area churches have discussed helping house some of the protesters overnight so that they could continue a 24-hour vigil if park police began enforcing the rules against overnight encampments. Rich Coffman, a Dallas, Texas, resident who has been camping in the Washington park for three weeks, said demonstrators from Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee, and New York are expected to come Monday to show solidarity with the capital demonstrators. Whatever happens with the camps and police, Caty McClure said it would not alter her and fellow demonstrators' commitment to their cause or their activism. ""The park and the occupation of the park is a tactic, it's not the movement,"" she said, calling the camps ""a really important symbolic statement."" ""If we can't sleep here, that does not end the movement."" Occupy DC is part of a larger activist surge that began last year in New York and quickly spread. While the protesters have highlighted a number of causes, the overarching theme has remained largely the same: populist anger over what activists portray as an out-of-touch corporate, financial and political elite. Demonstrators in Washington have been camping out in McPherson Square since the beginning of October. There was a daylong confrontation December 4 when protesters erected a wood structure overnight. It was eventually removed, after being deemed unsafe. On Saturday, some of them made noise -- and generated headlines -- in Washington outside the 99th annual Alfalfa Club dinner thrown for high-level dignitaries, including President Obama. As guests arrived, they were forced to pass through Occupy protesters. While police assisted attendees, demonstrators began throwing glitter. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, and other guests accompanying him were among those who were doused with the glitter.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Protesters across Iraq Tuesday urged government authorities to free the TV correspondent who threw his shoes at President Bush. TV reporter Muntadhar al-Zaidi, shown in a file photo, was jailed after throwing his shoes at President Bush. Hundreds of students at Diyala University in Baquba carried banners demanding the release of Muntadhar al-Zaidi -- described by demonstrators as an ""honorable Iraqi."" Smaller protests emerged in the Anbar province city of Falluja and in two Baghdad locations -- Baghdad University in the northern part of the city and western Baghdad's Ameriya district. In those events, students also took to the streets. Al-Zaidi threw his shoes at Bush while Bush and Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki were holding a Sunday news conference after the president's surprise visit to Baghdad. The journalist was dragged to the ground, hustled out of the room and arrested. Shouting as he was dragged to the floor, the reporter called his shoe-throwing -- a traditional insult in Arab culture -- a ""farewell kiss"" to a ""dog"" who launched the 2003 invasion of Iraq.  Watch Muntadhar al-Zaidi throw his shoes at Bush » . Dhirgham al-Zaidi, the shoe-thrower's brother, said the journalist hated the ""material American occupation"" and Iranian influence in Iraq. Asked about the incident by CNN's Candy Crowley, Bush said, ""I didn't have much time to reflect on anything. I was ducking and dodging."" He said the journalist was ""looking for notoriety"" and that authorities shouldn't overreact in their treatment of him. TV networks across the world continue to air the shoe-throwing scene, which has touched a nerve in the Arab world, where there has been an outpouring of support for al-Zaidi -- a correspondent for the Egyptian-based Al-Baghdadia TV. The network, which has been airing rolling live coverage about the incident, is urging his release and has invited guests who support him into its studio.  Watch Arab reaction to the incident » .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai's second attempt to seat a new Cabinet failed Saturday with the parliament rejecting a majority of his selections. The parliament approved seven ministers out of 17 nominees. They include Karzai's former national security adviser, Zalmai Rasoul, as foreign minister and Amina Afzali, one of three female nominees, as social affairs chief. Nominees for ministries of Justice, Haj and Islamic Affairs, Economics, Counter-Narcotics, and Rural Rehabilitation and Development also were approved. But the rejection of 10 names does not bode well for Karzai, who is under both international and domestic pressure to stamp out widespread corruption in Afghanistan and establish legitimacy for his administration, tainted by allegations of vote fraud in August. Among those rejected were candidates for higher education, public health and women's affairs. Parliament members have complained that Karzai's nominees are either corrupt or linked to warlords. Meanwhile, 14 militants and three international troops died in fighting over the past 24 hours in Afghanistan, authorities said Saturday. Eleven insurgents died in an overnight raid by Afghan and NATO-led troops in Sistanay, a village in the Nad-e-Ali district of Helmand province in southern Afghanistan, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. A ""sizable amount"" of black tar opium and a small weapons cache and bomb-making materials were found in the operation, it said. In eastern Paktika province Friday night, forces called in an airstrike against militants planting roadside bombs, the NATO-led mission said. Three militants, including a commander of the Haqqani network, were killed. In Khost province, north of Paktika, a roadside bomb Saturday struck the vehicle of the Bak district's sub-governor, who suffered minor injuries. The British Defense Ministry said two British soldiers were killed while on foot patrol Friday in Helmand. The NATO command said an ISAF service member was killed Saturday but didn't list the nationality or location of the incident.

"(CNN) -- Hockey great Gordie Howe, who suffered a ""significant"" stroke Sunday morning, is showing signs of improvement, his family said Wednesday in a written statement. Howe suffered the stroke while at his daughter's home in Lubbock, Texas. He has returned there while he recovers and is described as in guarded condition. ""We acknowledge that there is a long road to recovery ahead, but Dad's spirits are good and his competitive attitude remains strong,"" the family statement said. On Tuesday, one of Howe's sons told CNN the stroke affected his father's entire right side. Marty Howe said family members were on their way to Texas to visit with their father. The family said well-wishers could send cards to: Gordie Howe, c/o Texas Trailer Corral, 2207 Hwy 87, Lubbock, TX 79423. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Gordie and the Howe family.

"(CNN)  -- President Obama has ordered national security officials to look into allegations that the Bush administration resisted efforts to investigate a CIA-backed Afghan warlord over the killings of hundreds of Taliban prisoners in 2001. In an exclusive, CNN talked with President Obama in Ghana about his order to review alleged deaths of Taliban. ""The indications that this had not been properly investigated just recently was brought to my attention,"" Obama told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview during the president's visit to Ghana. The full interview will air 10 p.m. Monday. ""So what I've asked my national security team to do is to collect the facts for me that are known, and we'll probably make a decision in terms of how to approach it once we have all of the facts gathered up,"" Obama said. The inquiry stems from the deaths of at least 1,000 Taliban prisoners who had surrendered to the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance in late 2001. The fighters were in the custody of troops led by Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, a prominent Afghan warlord who has served as chief of staff of the country's post-Taliban army. Dostum, a former communist union boss and militia leader who fought against the U.S.-backed mujahedeen in the 1980s, is known for switching sides as Afghanistan's political conflict has evolved. When the United States invaded Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, Dostum sided with the Americans and received military and CIA support to battle the Taliban. The allegations against him first surfaced in a 2002 Newsweek report, which cited a confidential U.N. memo saying the prisoners died in cramped container trucks while being transported from their Konduz stronghold in northern Afghanistan to Sheberghan prison, west of Dostum's stronghold at Mazar-e Sharif. At the time, the Boston, Massachusetts-based group Physicians for Human Rights said it found a mass grave in nearby Dasht-e Leili, where witnesses said the bodies of Taliban prisoners were buried. The finding prompted U.S. Gen. Tommy Franks, who led the invasion of Afghanistan, to support an investigation into the allegations. But The New York Times, citing government officials and human rights organizations, reported Friday that the Bush administration ""repeatedly discouraged efforts to investigate the episode."" State Department officials recently have tried to derail Dostum's reappointment as military chief of staff to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the newspaper reported, citing several senior officials who suggested the administration ""might not be hostile to an inquiry."" Dostum, a key ally of Karzai, was reportedly living in exile in Turkey until last month, when he was reinstated to his post as defense minister. He had left Afghanistan over allegations that he had kidnapped Akbar Bai, a former ally turned political rival. When asked by CNN about whether Obama would support an investigation, the president replied, ""I think that, you know, there are responsibilities that all nations have, even in war. And if it appears that our conduct in some way supported violations of laws of war, then I think that, you know, we have to know about that.""  Watch part of CNN's exclusive interview with the president » . Susannah Sirkin, deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights, on Sunday praised Obama ""for ordering his national security team to collect all the facts in the Dasht-e-Leili massacre and apparent U.S. cover-up."" ""U.S. military and intelligence personnel were operating jointly and accepted the surrender of the prisoners jointly with General Dostum's forces in northern Afghanistan,"" Sirkin said earlier in the week. ""The Obama administration has a legal obligation to determine what U.S. officials knew, where U.S. personnel were, what involvement they had, and the actions of US allies during and after the massacre. These questions, nearly eight years later, remain unanswered.""","Allegations: Bush administration resisted inquiry into CIA-backed Afghan warlord .

"(CNN) -- On Monday, the team of grave diggers at Shaikh Radwan Cemetery in Gaza City prepared 15 graves, their busiest morning yet. And they're preparing for more. One of the slots was for 5-year-old Yusif Al-Dalou. He and eight members of his family were killed Sunday in an Israeli airstrike on their home. Their bodies were carried through the street to the sound of gunfire under Hamas banners to the cemetery. After the crowd left and the chanting stopped, friends and relatives prayed quietly. Israeli officials say the airstrike was targeting a Hamas military official, though no Hamas official is known to be among the dead. Fear in Israel despite Iron Dome . Gaza City's main cemetery is located outside the city, near the border with Israel and, therefore, too dangerous for funerals. So, on Monday, relatives were taking their dead to the Shaikh Radwan Cemetery, which is technically full. Back where Al-Dalou's home once stood, mourners greeted an Egyptian delegation led by Mohamed Katatni, head of the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. A member of the delegation vowed vengeance against Israel for the deaths of Gazan children -- caught in a struggle they were too young to comprehend. ""There will be an escalation,"" said Hamdi, whose brother was killed in another Israeli attack Sunday. Like many here, he said he is weary of war, but sees more coming. ""Israel won't accept our conditions,"" he said. ""It wants blood for blood."" Israel has demanded an end to rocket attacks from Gaza. ""Today, 116 rockets were launched from Gaza into Israel,"" IDF spokeswoman Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich told CNN. ""That was not a quiet day."" The view in parts of this strip of land -- about twice the size of Washington, D.C., and home to 1.7 million residents -- reveals the kinds of images that news networks typically show after massive earthquakes: mounds of rubble, lifeless bodies, survivors -- some wailing, others appearing bewildered. What's different this time . But the forces shaping Gaza City's pockmarked landscape Monday were no act of God, residents here said on the sixth consecutive day of Israel's attack. As darkness fell, the city's streets were deserted, quiet but for the constant buzz of drones overhead and the occasional blast of a missile either being launched or landing. On one street, a blast on Sunday hurled a boulder-sized chunk of road through the roof of a two-story building where two children and their family were living. ""The babies were under the rubble -- here and here,"" their aunt told CNN as she pointed to the chalky wreckage. ""They were sleeping with their father over here. Suddenly, the house collapsed. The brother ran to them. He found them under this rock."" Relatives say the 2-year and 4-year-old were fatally crushed; a nearby boulder was tinged red, the remains of the room covered in dirt. Their father survived. In an apartment below, the children's 22-year-old mother was wearing a black hijab that covered all but her eyes. ""I am in shock,"" she said. ""I don't believe it. My two children. They are priceless to me. My life now is very difficult."" She put her hands over the slit in the fabric over her eyes, bowed and shook. Online campaign seeks to stop the violence . The air strike occurred at about 1:30 a.m. By the time CNN arrived a few hours later, a bulldozer was moving piles of dirt into what neighbors said had been a crater left by the blast. A few streets away, people were picking through a similar landscape. The roof of a three-story building lay on the ground. A few yards away, a man in a green T-shirt held his head in his hands as he surveyed the wreckage. He said he had been warned. ""The Israel Defense Forces called us,"" he said. ""At first, we didn't believe them. Then they hit us with a small rocket on the roof. Ten minutes after that, they hit the house."" By then, the residents of the house had evacuated. Still,15 neighbors were wounded in the ensuing attack, he said. The Israeli military said it could not confirm it was responsible for either hit in a neighborhood known for having launched rockets toward Israel. CNN personnel saw rockets blasting from the area, leaving a trail of smoke over the neighborhood mosque. A building that housed a center used by some media outlets was also an apparent target of Israeli missiles. Witnesses said three explosions were followed by a ball of flame from the third floor at 3:20 p.m. At least two people were killed, Palestinian sources said. Ramez Harb, information leader of the military media office of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, was among them, the sources said. In addition, two children were wounded, the sources said. Journalists inside the building had also been warned to leave. They did so, staying out for several hours, after which a few returned. That's when it was hit. The building had also been struck on Sunday. Israel and Hamas: How the conflict reignited .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- France entered a fifth day of nationwide strikes Saturday as tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets, rallying against a government proposal to raise the national retirement age to 62. Protesters formed a line stretching two miles long near the historic Bastille Square in Paris, waving banners and shouting insults against the government of President Nicolas Sarkozy, CNN's Jim Bittermann reported. France's Interior Ministry said some 825,000 protesters turned out nationwide, while labor unions -- who oppose upping the retirement age --  said 3.5 million protesters attended the more than 200 demonstrations across the country Saturday. Emotions ran high in France as the pension debacle continued to pit the government against French unions. Analysts say pension reform will likely be a defining moment in Sarkozy's presidency. Despite repeated national strikes over the controversial proposal, France's National Assembly on Wednesday approved Sarkozy's pension reform bill which would raise the national retirement age from 60 to 62.The proposal passed 329 to 233, but still must pass the Senate to become law. The Senate is expected to vote October 31. In the meantime, throngs lined up on Saturday outside gas stations amid fears of fuel shortages as 10 of 12 oil refineries participated in the strikes. Only two of the refineries in France were in full production Saturday, according to the Union of French Petroleum Industries. But French Finance Minister Christine Laguarde told RTL radio in an interview Saturday that the country has several weeks worth of fuel stocks, saying ""the government confirms there is no shortage."" Yves Le Goff, a spokesman for the French Oil Industry Association, on Friday also said there is currently no rupture in the fuel supply, but that did not stop consumers from lining up at gas stations across the country to stock up on fuel, just in case. The work stoppage at the refineries had a direct effect on the two main Paris airports, Orly and Charles de Gaulle. Both are supplied by a pipeline that comes directly from refineries that were shut down Friday, according to Trapil, the company that owns the line. But a French transport ministry spokesman told CNN late Saturday that the pipeline supplying fuel to the airports has been reopened and is operating normally. While more than a dozen unions and federations have called for workers to strike, not everyone walked off the job. Officials at the Ministry of Education, for example, said only 30 percent of its sector was affected. Workers from both the public and private sectors are on strike, including those in transportation, education, justice, hospitals, media and banking. The strikes have also led to a reduction in train services throughout France. Blasting Sarkozy during a CNN interview Saturday, Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe accused the French president of ""arrogance."" ""It's three years this has been going on ... three years of stupidity on stupidity ... arrogance on arrogance .. even verbal violence on his part against some categories of French citizens,"" said Delanoe. But Sarkozy insists the changes are needed because rising life expectancy increases the financial burden on the pension system.","NEW: Fuel line from refineries to Paris airports is back on .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Republican-controlled House of Representatives on Thursday passed the GOP leadership's 2013 budget plan -- a measure that has no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate but creates a clear contrast between the two parties on a number of critical tax and spending issues ahead of the general election. The resolution passed in a strongly polarized 228-191 vote. No Democrats backed the measure; only 10 Republicans opposed it. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's $3.53 trillion blueprint includes an overhaul of the nation's tax code and major changes to popular entitlements such as Medicare -- expensive programs that in the past have been considered politically untouchable. Why the budget may never be balanced . Republicans say the plan is necessary to slow the growth of exploding federal deficits and put the federal government on the road to fiscal stability. ""We have one of the most predictable economic crises in this country coming. It's a debt-driven crisis. And so we have an obligation -- not just a legal obligation but a moral obligation -- to do something about it,"" Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said Thursday morning. GOP leaders ""think the key components are to get spending under control, reform our entitlement programs"" and help stimulate economic growth. Democrats, however, consider the plan a betrayal of last year's bipartisan deficit reduction deal and a GOP giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and vulnerable seniors. ""In our view, we certainly don't want to return to some of the economic policies that got us into the mess to begin with. And we are concerned that the Republican budget does that,"" said Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a member of the House Democratic leadership. ""It disrupts the fragile recovery and undercuts investments that are going to be important for the long-term economic strength of the United States of America."" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney released a statement after the vote blasting House Republicans for banding ""together to shower millionaires and billionaires with a massive tax cut paid for by ending Medicare as we know it and making extremely deep cuts to critical programs needed to create jobs and strengthen the middle class."" Romney garners two endorsements . Over the past two days, the sharply divided House has overwhelmingly rejected President Barack Obama's budget proposal, a House Democratic plan, a more conservative Republican alternative, and a bipartisan blueprint containing controversial spending cuts and tax hikes opposed by majorities in both parties. The blueprint -- derived from proposals advanced by a special commission led by former Clinton White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Wyoming GOP Sen. Alan Simpson -- includes roughly $2 trillion in cuts and more than $1 trillion in new tax revenues over the next decade. The measure failed in a 382-38 vote. While a budget resolution is not binding, it is used to guide congressional appropriators responsible for allocating federal dollars. Both chambers of Congress have not agreed on such a measure since the spring of 2009. Among other things, the Ryan plan calls for a reduction in individual tax rates and brackets. Instead of today's six brackets, with rates from 10% to 35%, it calls for just two: 10% and 25%. The proposal would eliminate the alternative minimum tax while dropping the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%. GOP leaders would compensate for lost revenue by closing a series of tax loopholes and ending numerous deductions. They have declined to offer any details, however, on exactly which loopholes and deductions would be affected, instead insisting that the matter will be taken up at the congressional committee level in the future. Returning to one of the most controversial points from last year's budget fight, the proposal includes dramatic changes to the Medicare program. It would offer future seniors a choice of staying in the traditional fee-for-service plan or opting instead for a Medicare-approved private plan, all of which would be available via a new Medicare exchange. No matter which plan they chose, including the traditional Medicare plan, seniors would receive a government subsidy to help pay for their choice. While Republicans insist the change is necessary to ensure the program's long-term fiscal viability, Democrats accuse the GOP of trying to destroy a key legacy of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. The Republicans ""want Medicare to wither on the vine, to die,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said this month. Medicaid, which provides health coverage for the poor, would be converted under the GOP plan into a series of block grants for states. Individual states would be empowered to tighten eligibility rules or revise enrollees' cost-sharing obligations. The GOP proposal also protects defense spending by undoing a scheduled $55 billion cut in the Pentagon budget, replacing the reduction with cuts elsewhere. Ryan has previously called the scheduled Pentagon cuts -- part of the agreement reached in last summer's Budget Control Act -- ""devastating to America's defense capabilities."" On Thursday, Ryan said senior military officials defending lower Pentagon spending proposals have not been honest. ""We don't think the generals are giving us their true advice,"" he said, accusing them of following an administration line. ""I think there is a lot of budget smoke and mirrors in the (administration's) Pentagon budget, which is not really a true, honest and accurate budget. When you confront military experts -- retired or active -- they concede these things to us."" Republicans would compensate for higher defense spending in part by requiring greater federal worker pension contributions and more means-testing of entitlement benefits. Overall, Ryan's plan caps 2013 domestic discretionary spending -- programs other than entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare -- at $1.028 trillion. Democrats immediately cried foul when the new proposed cap was unveiled, noting that it's nearly $20 billion below the total agreed to in last summer's deficit reduction deal. House GOP leaders insist they can propose any amount under the $1.047 trillion level, because that figure simply represents the top limit for discretionary spending, not a level up to which Congress must spend. While the House Republicans' proposed budget has no chance of becoming law, it could have a significant impact on this year's presidential and congressional campaigns. Democrats believe the proposed Medicare changes in particular could damage GOP hopes in key swing states such as Florida, which has a large elderly population. Numerous Republicans, however, believe they'll be rewarded for having the political courage to tackle politically sensitive issues. They also argue that it's important to draw clear distinctions with Democrats before voters go to the polls in November. CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","House of Representatives passes GOP Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan .

"(CNN) -- An iron gate with the notorious Nazi slogan ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" has been stolen from the former Dachau concentration camp in Germany, officials said. The slogan, which translates as ""Work sets you free,"" became emblematic of the forced labor camps of World War II in which so many inmates died. The gate was stolen overnight from Saturday to Sunday, officials at the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial said in an online statement. While this is the first such theft at Dachau, it's not the first time that the slogan has been targeted by thieves. The famous ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" sign at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland was stolen in 2009. It was discovered shortly afterward cut into three pieces. The Dachau center's director, Dr. Gabriele Hammermann, described this weekend's theft as a ""deliberate, reprehensible attempt to deny and obliterate the memory of the crimes committed in this place."" The gate is of ""highly symbolic importance,"" he said, and its removal is ""an attempt to demolish the memorial at its very core."" Hammermann said it was no coincidence that the theft occurred at a time when the number of survivors of the camps was dwindling due to their age -- and stressed that efforts to protect such historic sites and educate the public must continue, especially in the face of far-right radicalization. It's not yet known who was behind the theft. Police and state security services are investigating, the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial statement said. Dr. Max Mannheimer, a Holocaust survivor and vice president of the International Dachau Committee, said he was ""horrified that Nazis apparently so desecrated the memorial to those murdered here and violated the reverence due to such a place."" The Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum said, ""While we do not know who is behind the theft of the sign, the theft of such a symbolic object is an offensive attack on the memory of the Holocaust."" Germany charges 93-year-old as accessory to 300,000 Auschwitz murders . According to the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial, the gate was forged by inmates in one of the camp's workshops after it first opened in 1933 for political prisoners. A Communist inmate was ordered by the SS to fashion the lettering ""Arbeit macht frei,"" which was removed after the war and replaced by a reconstruction when the memorial was established in 1965, it said. The propaganda slogan ""reflects Nazis' attempts to appear harmless by presenting the concentration camp as a 'work and reeducation camp,'"" it said. Tens of thousands of Jewish, Sinti and Roma prisoners were also sent to the camp, many of whom died before it was liberated by U.S. Army troops in 1945.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama met with the Dalai Lama -- the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader -- at the White House on Thursday despite strong objections from Chinese government officials. The meeting has the potential to further complicate Sino-U.S. tensions, which have been rising in recent months. China has warned it would damage Beijing's ties to Washington. ""The Chinese side expresses strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this meeting,"" a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement afterward. ""China demands the U.S. seriously consider China's stance, immediately adopt measures to wipe out the adverse impact, [and] stop conniving and supporting anti-China separatist forces."" The Dalai Lama has said he favors genuine autonomy for Tibetans, not independence for Tibet. Beijing regards the Nobel Peace Prize laureate as a dangerous ""separatist"" who wishes to sever Tibet from China. Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama ""runs against the repeated commitments by the U.S. government that the U.S. recognizes Tibet as part of China and gives no support to 'Tibet independence,' "" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said. During the meeting, Obama stressed his ""strong support for the preservation of Tibet's unique religious, cultural and linguistic identity and the protection of human rights for Tibetans,"" according to a White House statement. The president praised the Dalai Lama's ""commitment to nonviolence and his pursuit of dialogue with the Chinese government,"" the statement added. He also stressed the importance of having both sides ""engage in direct dialogue to resolve differences, and was pleased to hear about the recent resumption of talks,"" it noted. The Dalai Lama, while acknowledging that he raised concerns about Tibet during the meeting, did not provide further specifics about his home region's political situation while addressing reporters. He said he admired America as a ""champion of democracy and ... freedom,"" and he cited the need to promote ""religious harmony"" and ""human value."" He also met with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The meeting between the Dalai Lama and Obama could ""seriously undermine the Sino-U.S. political relations,"" Zhu Weiqun, a senior Communist Party leader in charge of ethnic and religious affairs, warned recently. ""We will take corresponding action to make relevant countries see their mistakes."" On Thursday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman said the meeting ""grossly violated the norms governing ... international relations."" Obama did not meet with the Dalai Lama when the spiritual leader visited Washington in autumn, making it the first time since 1991 that such a meeting did not occur. Ahead of a summit with Chinese President Hu Jintao, Obama persuaded Tibetan representatives back then to postpone the meeting with the Dalai Lama. Thursday's encounter took place against the backdrop of several contentious issues already threatening to sour the relationship between America and China, including trade disputes, a recent U.S. arms sales deal for Taiwan -- which China considers an illegitimate breakaway province -- and a censorship fight over Internet search engine Google Inc. The meeting is ""another event in the recent, one has to say, downward spiral in U.S.-China relations,"" China scholar David Shambaugh said. It's also troublesome for the Chinese for one other important reason, Shambaugh said. ""He could have met him as a spiritual leader in a neutral place like a church,"" he said. But receiving him in the White House ""is a political act. And that is going to irritate China very much."" The meeting did not take place in the formal, official setting of the Oval Office. It was instead held in the White House Map Room, which is considered part of the presidential residence. The choice of settings was considered by many observers to be a sign of Washington's acknowledgment of Beijing's political sensitivities. Some analysts said the Chinese government could retaliate by cutting off political exchanges as it did after the Dalai Lama met with the heads of state of France and Germany. And Hu could turn down an invitation to visit Washington in April. Neither China nor the United States can afford strained relations, said Douglas Paal, a diplomat and investment banker who has served as a presidential adviser on China. ""We both need each other,"" he said. ""We need each other for a number of international security issues -- to deal with the global climate crisis, to deal with the global financial crisis."" Poll: Most Americans favor Tibetan independence . China is the largest-growing export market for U.S. companies, Paal said, expanding by 65 percent last year alone. Nearly three-quarters of all Americans think that Tibet should be an independent country, according to a national CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll. But the survey, released Thursday, also indicates that most Americans think it is more important to maintain good relations with China than to take a stand on Tibet.

"(CNN) -- The issue of human trafficking has exploded into the headlines in recent years. State and federal legislation has been passed helping to define trafficking more specifically and prosecute traffickers, while services enabling victims to lead productive lives, safely beyond the reach of their traffickers, have been proliferating. Meanwhile, anti-trafficking organizations are using technology in exciting new ways to find and rescue victims and provide network linkages to prosecute their traffickers successfully. Yet while such progress is welcome, many groups are only just beginning to focus on a crucial element of beating human trafficking -- cutting demand. After all, less demand means fewer trafficked victims. Sadly, human trafficking is a multibillion dollar global industry, with some estimates suggesting more than 21 million people are enslaved worldwide. Here in the United States, between 100,000 to 300,000 American children are at risk of being trafficked each year, according to the Department of Homeland Security, with the average age of a child first being trafficked just 13. Of course, while a trafficker can sell drugs or a gun once, sex with a child can be sold over and over again. It is hardly surprising then that there is also increasing evidence that many of the trafficking networks are interconnected with gang activity and drug and gun trafficking. A child cannot choose to sell sex for money. A minor being sold for sex is by definition being trafficked. There is no such thing as a child prostitute, only a sex-trafficked victim. Thankfully, there is a much needed mindset shift taking place among law enforcement and treatment providers, a change being increasingly embraced by those trained to recognize trafficked victims, but which needs to be accepted by the global community for continued change. In addition, more training is needed to identify human trafficking victims. Law enforcement, first responders, emergency room personnel, pediatricians, school personnel, foster care administrators, child welfare personnel, court-appointed advocates, hotel, airport and taxi staff -- many of whom come into contact with trafficked children without knowing it -- could all benefit from extra training. Increased awareness and proper protocols can help to identify correctly and get appropriate help to trafficked victims faster. Many of these victims find themselves in the social service system, where opportunities exist to get them the help they need if they can be correctly identified. Too often, survivors recount how they crossed paths with adults who could have helped them escape but who didn't see the situation clearly enough to offer them assistance. In the United States, Operation Cross Country, a joint sting operation between the FBI, U.S. Department of Justice and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, has recovered more than 3,500 minors since 2003. The Innocence Lost program recovered 168 victims this summer and arrested 281 pimps. Overseas, however, we have watched helplessly as Boko Haram has kidnapped hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls with the stated intent to sell them for sex. Four months later, and the international community has been unable to rescue them. The individual stories I've personally heard from trafficking survivors are heart-wrenching, yet it still happens every day in our country and around the world. Sometimes, one victim at a time, sometimes in large groups. Survivors' stories tell us that some victims are sold into trafficking by family members, some lured by attention and promises of glamour by an ""older boyfriend,"" only to be abused, branded and sold for sex; labor trafficking victims are often promised high-paying jobs far away from home, only to have their documents taken, their lives and families threatened and horrid working conditions waiting for them with no opportunity for escape. Runaways are often picked up by traffickers within 48 hours of running away from home, and no one is looking to find them. The common thread is that traffickers prey on society's most vulnerable. So what can we do? More than anything, it's up to us to do everything we can to protect our vulnerable citizens and continue this fight to make our communities and ultimately our world safer. It's up to us to be a voice for the voiceless. While we may not yet have a clear strategy for tackling Boko Haram, we can still be aware of the signs of trafficking and speak up in our communities when we see something that just doesn't look right. A shift in mindset about the definition of a trafficked victim, stronger legislation allowing better identification and services for victims and more vigorous prosecutions of traffickers offer a healthy start. But we have a long way to go -- there is more to do on all these fronts.","Human trafficking is a multibillion dollar global industry, Cindy McCain says .
Some 100,000 to 300,000 U.S. children are at risk of being trafficked each year, she says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Don't expect a chest bump on election night this year in Maine. Independent governor candidate Eliot Cutler denied a close relationship between himself and the Republican incumbent, Paul LePage, during their final debate Tuesday night. ""I would not suggest -- and I think he would agree, that we don't have a bromance,"" Cutler told CNN's Dana Bash while distancing himself from the man he high-fived and hugged during their first debate earlier this month. ""Four years ago ... we ended up with Paul LePage as governor. We shouldn't make that mistake again."" LePage agreed there's a lack of brotherly love between the two in a humorous moment during an hour-long debate, sponsored by WMTV, CNN, and WABI, along with Democratic candidate Rep. Mike Michaud. It's a tight race between LePage and Michaud. Cutler -- who hasn't registered above 20 percent in most recent polls -- has caused ire among Pine Tree state Democrats, who think he's splitting the anti-LePage vote that would coalesce around Michaud in a two-person race, ensuring a Democratic victory. LePage, who doesn't deny some benefits of the third party candidate, agrees Cutler is taking away from a major party candidate's smooth victory -- his own. ""If it was Mike Michaud versus Paul LePage, the election's over,"" he said about his own head-to-head strength against the six-term congressman. The candidates sparred that way as well, with LePage and Michaud saving their harshest attacks for each other, letting Cutler attack on topics he wanted or stay out of the ones he didn't. While talking broadly about infrastructure, health care, and taxes, Michaud's attacks over LePage's attempts to cut some government programs prompted some of the unvarnished candor he's earned a reputation for using when provoked. ""I've listened to all this rhetoric for about several months now; I'm tired of it,"" LePage said. ""This man doesn't know what honesty is, and that's all I can tell you."" Michaud showed some grit in his own rebut about LePage's frankness. ""What the governor says is anything, whether it's factual or not,"" he said. Cutler struck right down the middle, ignoring the sparks and proposing to find a way to pay for Michaud's proposals and avoid more of LePage's cuts. Asked about the current Ebola outbreak in America, Michaud struck at the state's preparedness, criticizing LePage for leaving two top infectious disease positions open at the Maine Center for Disease Control. ""The governor has failed us as far as keeping these positions vacant,"" Michaud said. LePage didn't take the bait and quickly turned to the work he's done since the crisis began to prepare the state and respond to two suspected cases that did not test positive. ""As your governor I'm not going to be irresponsible and scare the Maine people,"" he said. ""I am assured by the doctors, and by the professionals at the hospitals, that we are as prepared as we can be."" On this, Cutler agreed with Michaud that the positions needed to be filled but made a sharp turn to health care reform, spending very little time on the topic of Ebola. LePage also stood by his comments from the previous night's debate about people making a wage of $100,000 not qualifying as wealthy. ""I don't think it's off-mark, I don't think it's wealthy, I really don't,"" LePage said. ""I defy anybody to tell me if you're making make $100,000 and you've got two kids going to college, and you want to give to try to give them a good start in life, that that's a lot of money."" Michaud -- who prides himself as one who fights for the middle class -- pounced. ""The fact that the governor said last night that $100,000 is not a lot of money -- it IS a lot of money,"" Michaud said. ""The governor doesn't understand what hardworking men and women are going through here in the state of Maine."" Whoever wins will need appeal to Maine's love of bipartisanship, which has given Independent Angus King to the governor's mansion twice and a current senate seat in Washington. To do that though, perhaps a little more bromance is needed. CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash contributed to this report .","Independent Eliot Cutler hasn't cracked 20 percent in recent polls for the governor's race.

"(CNN)  -- Voters in Iceland on Saturday appear poised to reject a deal to pay billions of dollars to the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, which helped savers who were their own nationals who'd lost money in a failed Icelandic Internet bank. According to preliminary results, about 93 percent of voters rejected the deal, which would pay the United Kingdom and the Netherlands more than $5 billion for bailing out people who lost money in Icesave -- an online retail bank branch of Landsbanki. That Icelandic bank failed in October 2008, along with two other banks. Under a European Union directive, Iceland now owes compensation to Britain and the Netherlands. The Icelandic government has said it will honor its international obligations. Only 1.6 percent of the 74,000 ballots tallied so far were in favor of the deal, the country's foreign ministry said Saturday. Another 5.2 percent of the votes were empty ballots, the ministry said. About 200,000 people were registered to vote, it said. Iceland's parliament passed a bill authorizing a state guarantee for repayment of the funds, but President Olafur Ragnar Grímsson declined to sign it in January. He cited public disapproval, and in particular, an Internet petition signed by up to one-quarter of the electorate, as a reason for not signing the bill. He said there needed to be a national consensus in addressing the issue. That prompted Saturday's national referendum on the law. The Icelandic public widely disapproved of the deal, the government said in a fact sheet on the deal. ""There is widespread frustration over the claim on ordinary citizens in Iceland to pay the price for the irresponsible behavior of reckless bankers,"" it said. Magnus Arni Skulason, who campaigned against the bill, called the terms of the loan repayment unacceptable. ""Of course we feel empathy for those people that lost money,"" he said. ""We just want to get a more reasonable agreement,"" he told CNN. ""There are sovereign issues that ... would not be acceptable to any country,"" he said. ""Also there is a staggering interest rate ... equal to running the national health care system for six months here in Iceland."" He called the collapse of the Icelandic banks during the world financial crisis of 2008-09 a ""shared responsibility of Iceland, the UK and the Netherlands,"" blaming ""financial regulators"" in the countries. It is not clear what will happen if voters say no to the loan guarantees. The Icelandic government said it has ""clearly stated its intention to honor its international obligations and remains fully committed to implementing the bilateral loan agreements with the UK and the Netherlands..."" The International Monetary Fund loaned Iceland $2.1 billion in November, and said repaying the money to the British and Dutch governments was a requirement of the loan. Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos told CNN in January that nonrepayment of the funds would affect ""the long-term interest of the Iceland economy and the Iceland people."" Britain's Treasury expects Iceland to live up to its obligations, it said in a statement in January. Iceland has begun moves toward applying for European Union membership, which Britain and the Netherlands could block. Britain spent 2.3 billion pounds ($3.69 billion) last year to cover the losses that British savers incurred when Icelandic banks collapsed. The Dutch government spent 1.3 billion euros ($1.87 billion) to cover bank losses in the country. The government of Iceland has for the past three weeks been engaged in a dialogue with the governments of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, hoping for a resolution, Iceland's foreign ministry said Friday. Iceland called the talks ""constructive,"" adding that ""Iceland is confident that a mutually acceptable solution can be reached.... and is hopeful that discussions will resume as early as next week."" Despite his refusal to sign the bill, Grímsson told CNN in January that ""Iceland recognizes its obligations under this agreement."" Resolving the issue, he added, ""is a key to our recovery and our harmonious relations with these countries."" The law on which Icelanders voted Saturday would compensate Britain and the Netherlands by 2024. A simple majority is needed for the bill to pass. About 300,000 people live in Iceland.","NEW: According to preliminary results, about 93 percent of voters rejected the deal .

"(CNN) -- Thirteen Tennessee juveniles escaped from the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center on Friday night, the same juvenile detention center in Nashville where 32 escaped earlier this month. That's an average of more than 1Â½ escapes per day. By Saturday morning, 12 of the 13 most recent escapees had been recaptured and brought to a juvenile court detention in Nashville to face additional charges, according a Tennessee Department of Children's Services (TDCS) statement. A 16-year-old ""with a record that includes theft, assault and runaway"" remains at large. Two of the 32 teenagers who escaped back on September 1 are still on the lam. According to its website, Woodland Hills is for ""delinquent male youth"" between the ages of 13 and 19 that have committed at least three felonies. Among those rounded up from the latest jailbreak, ""many, if not all, of them have been involved in the previous two incidents,"" the TDCS statement said. Wait: Previous two? In May, a group of teens broke out through a window and flipped a gate switch in an unsuccessful attempt to free others, according to CNN affiliate WSMV-TV in Nashville. ""Since the last set of escapes, the department has been rapidly upgrading security,"" TDCS said. ""Aluminum panels that students were able to kick through have been replaced with steel ... a project to reinforce the perimeter fence with concrete at the base is nearly complete."" But TDCS, which operates the Woodland Hills facility, says its guards ""have few methods to control the youth ... they do not have weapons or pepper spray."" The only thing they do have, according to the TDCS website, is a radio to call for help. Another problem, it would seem, is that the delinquent felons in lockup are not actually allowed to be locked up. ""Because of a decades old court settlement, the youth are not allowed to be locked inside their rooms,"" it said in a Saturday statement. According to an account of the incident provided by TDCS, Friday's escape occurred after two inmates -- which it refers to as students -- overpowered a guard that was making his rounds. ""He was assaulted, and the students took his radio and keys. The other youth in the dorm came out of their unlocked rooms."" The group then made its way to the perimeter gate, where one of them ""was able to wriggle through a gap between the fence and the gate"" and make it over to the guard house -- which he was able to break into by throwing a rock through the window. Once inside, he flipped the electric switch that opened the gate, liberating his comrades. Woodland Hills said two of its staff members were injured in the escape, one was treated at the scene, while the other was taken to a Nashville hospital. CNN's Carma Hassan and Joe Sutton contributed to this report .","13 inmates escape from the same facility where 32 escaped Sept. 1 .

"(CNN) -- In a scathing letter released on the anniversary of George Zimmerman's arrest in Trayvon Martin's shooting death, Zimmerman's mother writes that her son was charged ""solely to placate the masses,"" and that the news media helped pass on a false narrative against an innocent man. ""April 11, 2012, will be forever remembered by the Zimmerman family as the day the justice system failed us as Americans, and as a consequence an innocent man was arrested for a crime he did not commit, solely to placate the masses,"" Gladys Zimmerman wrote. Zimmerman's brother, Robert, posted a link to her letter on his Twitter account. Authorities say George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, shot 17-year-old Martin in Zimmerman's neighborhood in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012. Zimmerman's brother apologizes for offensive tweet . Zimmerman is awaiting trial, charged with second-degree murder in Martin's death. He claims he shot Martin in self-defense after Zimmerman saw the teenager acting suspiciously in the neighborhood. Zimmerman told police that the two exchanged words and Martin went after him. According to his account, the teen -- who was unarmed -- punched him, forced him to the ground and slammed his head on a sidewalk. Attorneys for Martin's family have accused Zimmerman of racially profiling the 17-year-old and shooting him ""in cold blood."" Gladys Zimmerman's letter is critical of those attorneys for the Martin family, claiming they manipulated ""perception in order to sway the 'court of public opinion.'"" She contends that a vast amount of evidence released since the shooting supports her son's self-defense claim, but most media outlets have avoided its publication and turned him into a ""mythological monster."" In response to the letter, Martin's family members and their attorneys released a statement saying, ""For the Zimmerman family to allege that the justice system doesn't work, simply because they are unhappy their son was arrested in the first place, is disingenuous and disrespectful to the very system that is currently affording him every available opportunity to defend himself."" The statement continued, ""The arrest of an admitted killer is not a violation of due process, it is due process."" Addressing supporters, Gladys Zimmerman wrote about her son's trial, set for June: ""My son has always told the truth and your trust is well-placed. The upcoming trial will not disappoint you."" Meanwhile, a financial update posted Thursday on the website for the Zimmerman Legal Defense Fund Trust said the defense ""is now running at a deficit, and it is unclear how the defense will be funded moving forward."" According to the update, since March 3 the fund raised $14,458.63 to help pay for Zimmerman's defense. ""Current liabilities exceed cash on hand by about $10,000,"" the update said. The site said from the time the fund was established last May 2 through January 3, more than $314,000 was raised for Zimmerman's defense. Letters to Zimmerman show split opinions .

"(CNN) -- In its first week on sale, Walter Isaacson's biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs sold 379,000 copies in the U.S., making it by far the top-selling book in the country.

"London, England (CNN) -- Nearly two decades after the killing of toddler James Bulger by two 10-year-old boys in a suburb of Liverpool, what remains one of Britain's most notorious child murders this week proved once again it has the power to shock and outrage. Seen at the time as symbolic of a flawed society, the killing of Bulger -- whose poignant last moments being led to his death were caught by security camera -- continues to be dissected by a country still struggling to comprehend the crime. This came to a head nine years ago when British authorities provoked anger by releasing the killers, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, just eight years into the life sentences they received for attacking and torturing Bulger and dumping his battered body on a railway track. And the fury resurfaced this week with confirmation that one of the two boys, Jon Venables, now a 27-year-old man, was placed back in police custody after breaching the conditions of his release. The pair were jailed for an indefinite period in 1993, but were released after Britain's National Parole Board ruled that they were no longer a threat to the public. The British government has so far declined to reveal why Venables had been recalled into custody. Legal commentator Alan Caplin told CNN police would not have acted lightly given the amount of money the authorities have spent on giving the boys new homes and identities. ""I think one can surmise reasonably that... it must be quite serious if there's some intervention in that reset life,"" he said. The conditions imposed on the boys on their release banned them from contacting each other, Bulger's family or from returning to the region of Merseyside, in northwest England, where the crime was committed . British Home Secretary Alan Johnson told Sky News the reason for the recall would be revealed in time. ""I believe the public do have a right to know and I believe they will know all the facts in due course,"" he said. However, British Justice Secretary Jack Straw was quoted in the Times Wednesday as saying it was in the public interest to withhold the details. ""I have no interest in gratuitously or unnecessarily withholding information, but there are good reasons to withhold it at the moment and that is in the public interest,"" he said. Venables and Thompson were school boys when they abducted and killed two-year-old Bulger in a crime described by the trial judge as ""unparalleled evil and barbarity."" In 1993, grainy CCTV images showed the boys leading the toddler away from his mother at a busy shopping center in Liverpool, England. Public anger grew as details emerged of the chilling attack in which the boys tried to drown Bulger before beating him with rocks, bricks and iron rod. His battered body was left on a railway line to be cut in half by an oncoming train. In November 1993, after being tried in an adult court, the boys were found guilty of murder and ordered to serve at least eight years of an indefinite prison sentence. The following year, their minimum sentences were increased to 15 years by then-UK Home Secretary Michael Howard who had received a petition signed by more than 275,000 people in support of life sentences. However in 1997, the House of Lords, the upper chamber of parliament, overturned the increase and the boys were freed in 2001 on the condition that they could be recalled to custody at any time during their lives if there was ""any evidence that they present a risk to the public."" The boys were given new identities and passports and since 2001 have been protected by an injunction banning publication of their images taken after 1993, and anything that could reveal their current names and locations. Both the boys received death threats and it was feared they would be targeted if their whereabouts were divulged. The first reaction from James Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, to Venables' detention was posted in a Twitter message that read: ""would like to let everyone know jon venables is were he belongs tonight behind bars is this my sons justice."" The British parole board will now determine whether Venables should remain in custody or return to the life he has been given since his release from jail.","Jon Venables back in police custody after breaching conditions of his release .

It appears Jessa may have bent one of those rules as she reportedly gave Ben a full on frontal hug after he proposed following a romantic scavenger hunt in August. Fans got a chance to see the proposal and all that led up to it in a special titled ""19 Kids & Counting: Jessa's Engagement"" which aired this week. Their wedding will air on an upcoming episode.","""19 Kids & Counting"" star Jessa Duggar got married on Nov. 1 .

"(CNN) -- Six years removed from the death of their son -- former NFL star Pat Tillman -- in Afghanistan, Patrick and Mary Tillman say they haven't gotten the full truth from the U.S. Army and don't expect to. ""No, we don't know the whole truth,"" Mary Tillman said on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Monday night. ""They never did a criminal investigation after Pat was killed. So, without that proper criminal investigation, they destroyed evidence, which is long gone. There really is no way for us to know exactly what happened to him."" Tillman was a safety with the Arizona Cardinals in the National Football League when he passed up a multimillion-dollar contract to join the Army in 2002, after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. He was a corporal with the service's elite Rangers when he was killed during an ambush in an Afghan mountain pass in April 2004. The Army posthumously awarded Tillman the Silver Star, the third-highest U.S. combat decoration, announcing that he had been killed leading a counterattack. But it later admitted that officers in his chain of command knew almost immediately that he had been shot accidentally by his own comrades. For five weeks, his family was not told that the death was a result of friendly fire. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, both declined to appear with the Tillmans on CNN. However, the U.S. Army did issue a statement. ""As an Army, we failed in our duty to the memory of a fallen soldier and to his family. The failures of a few brought discredit to the Army and compounded the grief suffered by the Tillman family,"" the Army statement said. ""The Army truly regrets the pain and suffering endured by the Tillman family as a result of this tragic, friendly fire accident and the shortfalls in reporting accurate information to them in the days and weeks after Pat's death."" Mary Tillman took issue with the Army's characterization of events. ""They weren't shortfalls. They weren't missteps and they weren't errors,"" Tillman said. ""They were deliberate attempts to cover up what happened in order for them to use Pat's death for propaganda purposes at a time during the war in 2004 when [the] Abu Ghraib Prison scandal was breaking ... it was a terrible time for the military and for that administration, and Pat's death was an opportunity for them."" Patrick Tillman said he hasn't ruled out that his son may have been deliberately killed. ""I haven't eliminated it,"" he told King. ""There is strong evidence of two shooters, not one."" The Tillmans, who are divorced, are promoting this week's opening of ""The Tillman Story,"" a new documentary about the death of their son and the controversy that followed it. Mary Tillman also is the author of the book ""Boots on the Ground by Dusk: My Tribute to Pat Tillman.""","Pat Tillman quit the NFL in 2002 to join the Army after September 11 .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- ""Big Brother is watching you."" This is the sinister maxim repeated throughout George Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty-Four,"" his dark portrayal of life inside an authoritarian state characterized by its omniscient and paranoid leadership. Fortunately this kind of dystopian nightmare is confined to fiction for most of us -- or more recently the world of reality television with the phenomenally successful Big Brother show, where groups of hapless ""housemates"" try to outlast each in an isolated environment where their every move is monitored 24 hours a day. And now the show is coming to China's small screen, an irony that won't be lost on many in a country that purportedly has more people employed to censor the Internet than its army (the world's largest) has soldiers. Launching in early 2015, the first-ever Chinese version of Big Brother will air for ten weeks, with production in China set to begin shortly, according to Endemol China -- part of the Asian arm of one of the world's leading multi-platform program makers -- who will partner with Chinese digital video platform Youku Tudou Inc. to produce the show. ""In a market that annually generates hundreds of billions of video views, partnering with the number one digital video platform will allow us to bring Big Brother to a young audience and deliver the most immersive, interactive and unique experience to fans across the nation,"" said Endemol's CEO of Asian Operations Arjen van Mierlo. Victor Koo, Chairman and CEO of Youku Tudou Inc. said: ""We are delighted to be joining forces with Endemol to finally bring this groundbreaking format to China. Fifteen years after its launch, Big Brother continues to be a worldwide hit that engages passionate young fans across multiple platforms."" 'Excessive' and 'vulgar' The announcement comes at a time when authorities are concerned about the lack of originality and diversity of Chinese programs, as well as ""excessive"" and ""vulgar"" entertainment -- with foreign content in their crosshairs. Shows such as ""Chinese Idol,"" a talent show that replicates the formula of the hugely popular ""American idol,"" have been a huge success with viewers and sponsors alike. But as of this year, satellite broadcasters are only permitted to buy the rights to more than one foreign-made program per year. Big Brother, which has been running for 15 years, continues to be a hit in the USA, Europe, Australia, Canada and Israel, as well across Latin America, Scandinavia, Africa and Asia.","Launching in early 2015, the first-ever Chinese version of Big Brother will air for ten weeks .

"(CNN) -- [CAUTION: Read no further if you're not up to date on ""Doctor Who.""] . Some critics have called Peter Capaldi's first season as ""Doctor Who"" one of the best since the series relaunched eight years ago, and it looks like it's ready to go out with a bang. Last week's episode had one of the greatest twists ever for a television show that started way back in 1963. It wrapped up a story line involving Missy, a mysterious character who fans of the time traveling series had been seeing since the eighth season started. Missy was revealed as the Doctor's arch enemy, the Master, having regenerated into a woman with a penchant for Victorian-era fashion. This was just after the Doctor's companion, Clara, lost her boyfriend, who was in the Master's clutches. So how will it all end this week? It has been an emotional, thrilling season to say the least, and CNN spoke to Jenna Coleman (Clara) and Michelle Gomez (the Master) to get the lowdown on what to expect when the season winds down on Saturday -- and of course the big question is, will Coleman be returning for the ninth season? CNN: First, I have to ask how it's been working with this new Doctor, Peter Capaldi. Jenna Coleman: It seems to have been received really well, which is lovely. We love working together. What it's done is it just keeps catapulting the story forward. It's nice because it's never had time to settle. The relationship between Clara and the Doctor this series has always been a rocky road. They're still finding their way. But they have this history -- she's met all incarnations of the Doctor, so they've got this bond that's unbreakable. They are really strong -- it leads to some good drama. Michelle Gomez: I knew Peter through a mutual friend, and Peter and I are from the same part of Scotland in Glasgow. I felt like we knew each other as we share a friend. Coming from the same town, we have the same Glaswegian sense of humor. I remember sitting to his right in the read-through eating a banana, which he liked. We found each other funny, and that helped with bringing fun on the day. Coleman: It's a very complicated relationship. It's really intricate but [Clara]'s so weaved through each of his lives. It's not a relationship you can compare to anything else, really. Ultimately they're best friends, kind of parent to one another, they absolutely annoy each other. It's a rich, really complicated relationship that I personally love. In theory, it shouldn't work -- he's an alien that's been alive for 2,000 years and she's a schoolteacher. Across all of that, they have a really strong friendship. Because it's so offbeat, it's really charming and unusual. Somehow, they belong together. That's what I really love about their relationship. Gomez: Finally we have an age-appropriate Doctor -- I feel like I'm in safe hands. I feel that he's experienced with his age, maturity and wisdom. I love his attitude, his energy. I find him fascinating -- a multifaceted, contradictory enigma rolled into one. He's like David Bowie -- he's more rock and roll. CNN: You have both played characters with big secrets - Clara was ""The Impossible Girl"" - have you enjoyed that? Gomez: It's been great and I'm a fan of ""Doctor Who"" as well, I've enjoyed all the different theories, and everyone's different theories and ideas about who she might be. Coleman: It's great to hear the theories and keep people guessing. Michelle's secret -- she's so bonkers and absolutely brilliant -- she's my favorite villain we've had in the show. Her and Peter are just so well matched together. CNN: Do you get recognized by the fans? Gomez: Sometimes, but hopefully I don't much resemble Missy, because I don't dress like that, thank God. Being in Victorian dress can be difficult when you like to eat a lot of pies, and I like to eat a lot of pies. CNN: What about the world tour this past summer? Coleman: It was such an experience. Peter's family came and I brought my mom and dad. To suddenly, after all that work in Cardiff, to come out for some air, and to meet people who are so enthusiastic about the show and what they like and don't like -- it makes you excited to go back and film some more. We'd often be in a city for 30 hours. It was the closest we'd ever get to being in a band -- quite a strange band. CNN: What can you tell us about what to expect in the finale? Coleman: It's not what you'd expect. Clara keeps learning how to survive -- hopefully people will cry and be surprised. How general is that for you? [Laughs] . Gomez: Even I don't know what's happening. We have three different endings, and I have no idea what they're going with -- I'm just as excited as everyone else to find out how it turns out. CNN: Will we know at the end of the episode if you're returning to the show? Coleman: That is how it's gonna work. There's been a lot of secrets this year -- for the sake of [executive producer] Steven [Moffat]'s brilliant storytelling -- it's so good to keep people guessing. Back to my first episode, ""Asylum of the Daleks,"" the fact that that was a surprise; it was good to get that shock factor. It's gonna work out so much better to watch it and see what's gonna happen. We're teasing it out, basically. CNN: And finally, a fan on Twitter asked Jenna: Given that you've been in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and ""Doctor Who,"" would you ever play a superhero given the chance? Coleman: I'm buddies with all the superheroes. [Laughs] Depending on what it was, it would be an awful lot of fun. Clara gets her share of heroic moments, and gets to do stunts. Even though she is just a schoolteacher, I'm getting my fair share of action stuff. If it's a good story, then that's great. I'd like to do something quite theatrical -- I'd like to do something bold and big.","The stakes couldn't be higher for ""Doctor Who"" in the season finale .

"(Martha Stewart Living) -- Your Nana's collection of figurines. The treadmill from your days as a runner. That unfinished five-year quilting project. As spring-cleaning season kicks in, you're inspired to chuck anything that isn't being put to good use. But then you falter, since getting rid of stuff can be an emotionally charged process. Martha Stewart Living: Spring cleaning to-do list: The 12 things you need to clean . ""A lot of us hold on to items not because we love them or they're useful, but because we're living in the past or for the future,"" says Monika Eckfield, an assistant professor at California State University East Bay who studies people's relationships with things. Indeed, a lot of us have a hard time letting go, if the 2.3 billion square feet -- or 82.5 square miles -- of self-storage units in the U.S. is any indication. (Never mind what's crammed under our beds.) For the estimated 2 to 5% of Americans who suffer from hoarding, a mental disorder often related to depression and anxiety, this is a problem that interferes with daily life. Martha Stewart Living: 10 clever house-cleaning tricks . But for most people, the buildup of stuff happens gradually and naturally over decades. Regardless of the degree of clutter in your home, experts agree there are ways to clear it once and for all. Psychoanalyze your stuff . ""There has not been much research into why we form these attachments to objects, psychologically, but most of us form them,"" says Gail Steketee, dean of social work at Boston University and coauthor of several books on hoarding. She says that most people store stuff for a handful of reasons: ""Sometimes it's just simple joy or aesthetics -- there's pleasure in seeing an object -- but often nostalgia, guilt and anxiety play a role."" Martha Stewart Living: 19 tips for perfect laundry every time . Steketee suggests examining your reasons for keeping an item: ""Do you use it or not? If not, is it something of beauty? Or is there another reason you're holding on to it?"" she asks. ""Often people pile the reasons on top of each other -- it was mom's juicer, and it still works, and besides, that orange color is kind of nice."" If you find yourself struggling for justifications, or realize you still have an item out of obligation more than anything else, it may be time to let it go. Professional organizer Barbara Reich suggests considering whether your attachment is overblown: ""An item might be something an aunt bought ages ago for 20 cents, and people think, 'Oh, I can't get rid of it.' When really your aunt wouldn't care if you got rid of that candy dish."" Reich also says to take a hard look at items you're retaining for practical reasons -- a box of DVDs, say -- and think about what will happen if you get rid of it but wind up needing it later. (A DVD can be borrowed from the library or rented.) Martha Stewart Living: Martha's ultimate organizing solutions . Part ways happily . A successful sweep can entail enlisting the help of a friend or professional organizer, says Erin Rooney Doland, editor in chief of Unclutterer.com. ""Talking about the items helps you make rational decisions,"" she says. ""Telling stories can help you let the items go."" Finding objects a good home can also serve as an emotional cushion -- giving that volume of art books to a school library is less wasteful and traumatic than leaving them at the curb. ""The good feeling that comes from donating helps counter any guilt,"" says Steketee. To purge thoughtfully, don't expect to clear everything out in a weekend. ""A lot of folks get motivated, then lose steam -- and now they've made an even bigger mess, because they've pulled out half the closet's contents,"" says Eckfield. She suggests setting manageable goals, like one shelf per weekend. Save space for sentimentality . Remember, ""you are not a robot,"" says Doland. Despite being a professional organizer, she keeps sentimental items herself -- a pair of scissors from camp when she was 16 years old, for instance. ""Scissors aren't a distraction from the life I want to lead,"" she says, ""but a large box crammed with trinkets from that same summer would be clutter."" Setting physical parameters -- one box per year of your kids' childhood, for example -- helps you zero in on what matters most. Reich advises saving these things in a way that honors their importance -- labeled and well-wrapped. Then revisit them periodically to see if your feelings have changed. Martha Stewart Living: 12 tools to use in your house in unexpected ways . The emotional uptick to divesting yourself of the rest? ""You no longer feel like your stuff is hanging over you,"" says Doland. ""You have more space for the life you want -- physically in your home, but also mentally."" Eckfield remembers when an older client finally acknowledged that she was never going to make beaded jewelry again and got rid of her supplies. Instead of mourning the end of a longtime hobby, she saw off-loading those supplies ""as a fresh opportunity to do something new,"" says Eckfield. ""She told me, 'There's a time when you have to hang up your spurs.'"" Martha Stewart Living: Top 50 everyday money-saving tips . Decluttering the digital way . If there are items you want to keep -- but rarely need to look at -- consider these electronic options. Photographs . You're better off scanning old prints than letting them disintegrate in a box. Take them to a professional photo shop, or scan them onto your phone with an app like Ancestry.com's Shoebox. As you take new photos, avoid another pileup by creating digital folders, organized by month or occasion, says Reich. ""I also tell clients to stop printing photos unless they're being framed,"" she adds. Children's artwork . Like many parents, Doland, a mother of two, has a hard time parting with her kids' artwork. Her process: Collect the items in a bin, and comb through it once a year, since identifying the keepers is easier with some distance. Put a few favorites in a portfolio, and photograph the rest for a digital gallery. Send almost-keepers to relatives and the rest to the recycling bin. (Doland even has her husband take the bin to the curb.) Books . Yes, books bring warmth to a room, but ""when they no longer fit on the shelves, they're a problem,"" says Reich. ""Only keep books you truly love, and purge the ones you didn't enjoy or will never read again."" If you're on the fence about getting rid of a book, check if it's available as an e-book or still in print (most kids' classics never go out of print). Keepsakes . Photograph knickknacks, toys and other sentimental things before parting ways with them, suggests Doland. Take it a step further by creating a photo book on a site like Shutterfly and enlisting family members to share memories in the captions. You can also print the photo and frame it to keep the item around the house while reducing its footprint -- with the right Instagram filter, that old mixer or ragged teddy bear can become a work of art. What have you kept and what have you tossed? Share your experience in the comments, on Twitter @CNNliving or on CNN Living's Facebook page.","Having trouble tossing something with sentimental value? You're not alone .
Professional organizers suggest re-homing objects or analyzing why you've kept them .

"(CNN) -- Tokyoites may brag about having the most Michelin stars in the world, but Hong Kongers can actually eat in theirs without breaking the bank. Unveiled last week, the 2015 Michelin guide to Hong Kong and Macau awards 75 restaurants with its coveted stars -- 64 in Hong Kong and 11 in Macau. Bo Innovation, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, Lung King Heen, 8 ½ Otto e Mezzo-Bombana, Sushi Shikon, Robuchon au Dome (Macau) and The Eight (Macau) are once again crowned with three Michelin stars. (All restaurants in this story are located in Hong Kong unless otherwise indicated.) But what makes Hong Kong special are the prices -- Hong Kong and Macau are among the most affordable Michelin lists in the world -- and variety. ""The selection in the 2015 guide also shows to what extent Hong Kong is increasingly attractive to young foreign chefs, more and more of whom are moving to the city,"" said Michelin in a statement accompanying the release of the guide. ""Hong Kong has become an undisputed leader in the international culinary landscape."" Starred cheap eats . Hong Kong Michelin guide mainstay Tim Ho Wan (9-11 Fuk Wing St., Sham Shui Po; +852 2788 1226) has long been known as the cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant in the world. The humble establishment has now expanded to three branches and all receive one-star status in the 2015 guide. A dim sum meal at Tim Ho Wan can easily cost less than $12. After losing its place in the guide last year, Ho Hung Kee (Shop 1204-05, 12/F, Hysan Place, 500 Hennessy Road, Causeway Bay; +852 2577 6060), celebrated for its $8 wonton noodle, returns in the 2015 guide with one star. Serving roasted goose noodle for about $8, Yat Lok (34-38, Stanley St., Central; +852 2524 3882) advanced from the Bib Gourmand list to a one-star Michelin pick. Newbies on the list . There are 15 new entries in the guide. Some are also new to Hong Kong. Notable newbs include Seasons (one star), helmed by former executive chef of L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon; and Olivier Elzer, open only since June (Shop 308, 3/F, Phase 2, Lee Garden, 2-38 Yun Ping Road, Causeway Bay; +852 2505 6228). Another new one-star entry is NUR (3/F, 1 Lyndhurst Tower, Lyndhurst Terrace, Central; +852 2871 9993), which opened in April. Chef Nurdin Topham says the secret to snatching a star so quickly is differentiating itself from competitors. ""We are committed to finding local products from producers in the region and working with the best local farmers, which may be in contrast to other restaurants,"" says Topham. ""(Our) delivery cost is four times higher than normal."" Topham says many ingredients take only 48 hours at the most to go from the farm to NUR's tables. Local celeb restaurateur Hardy Kam may have lost control of his renowned family restaurant Yung Kee -- after losing a high-profile court case involving the Kam brothers -- but his new eatery, Kam's Roast Goose (G/F, Po Wah Commercial Center, 226 Hennessy Road, Wan Chai; +852 25201110), was also awarded one star.

"(CNN) -- Televangelist Pat Robertson wasn't blaming Haiti's catastrophic earthquake on ""God's wrath,"" but was talking about a ""widely discussed"" legend that a Satanic pact aided its founding slave revolt, a spokesman said. But the suggestion that Haiti's historic woes stem from a deal with the devil comes from a 19th-century ""fabrication"" meant to discredit its slave rebellion and Vodou religion, a Caribbean scholar said Thursday. ""This is a longstanding trope of anti-Haitian venom,"" Kate Ramsey, a researcher at the University of Miami, told CNN. Robertson invoked the tale on his syndicated program, ""The 700 Club,"" on Wednesday to suggest the poverty-stricken country's long history of natural disasters and political turmoil stemmed from a deal with the devil made by the leaders of its 1791 revolution against French rule. ""They said, 'We will serve you if you will get us free from the French.' True story,"" Robertson said. ""And so, the devil said, 'OK, it's a deal.' "" The revolt succeeded, ""but ever since, they have been cursed by one thing after the other,"" the 79-year-old Christian Coalition founder and onetime Republican presidential candidate said. The legend of a Haitian deal with the devil dates back to the decades following its independence in 1804, Ramsey said. It began with a Roman Catholic campaign against Vodou, the Afro-Haitian religion widely practiced in Haiti, and spread as anti-slavery movements gained ground in the Caribbean, Europe and America, she said. ""They did become mobilized to discredit what was called the first black republic by outsiders, especially in the context of debates over abolition in the Caribbean and elsewhere,"" Ramsey told CNN. European colonists in the Caribbean and the Americas believed that the Haitian slaves ""could not have possibly pulled this off themselves"" and must have had outside help, Ramsey said. Evangelical Christians have evoked the Haiti legend more recently and elaborated on it, ""but it's drawing on a much longer history,"" she said. ""It's utterly a fabrication, and it's an extremely offensive one,"" she added. Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest country, has faced a string of natural disasters in the past two decades and been wracked by political chaos for much of its history. In a statement posted on the broadcaster's Web site, Christian Broadcasting Network spokesman Chris Roslan said the ""widely-discussed"" legend, ""combined with the horrible state of the country, has led countless scholars and religious figures over the centuries to believe the country is cursed."" But, he added, ""Dr. Robertson never stated that the earthquake was God's wrath."" ""If you watch the entire video segment, Dr. Robertson's compassion for the people of Haiti is clear. He called for prayer for them. His humanitarian arm has been working to help thousands of people in Haiti over the last year, and they are currently launching a major relief and recovery effort to help the victims of this disaster."" Robertson has previously linked natural disasters and terrorist attacks -- including Hurricane Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people on the Gulf Coast in 2005 -- to legalized abortion in the United States.","Televangelist invoked tale saying natives made deal with devil for freedom from France .

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court tried mightily to wade through a cloud of bureaucratic regulations Monday over setting clear air standards, a high-stakes environmental and economic fight pitting the Obama administration against a coalition of states and utilities. The justices on Monday heard six separate appeals, which were consolidated into more than 100 minutes of often dense oral arguments. A ruling is expected by June. At issue is narrow, but potentially far-reaching -- whether the Environmental Protection Agency can tighten emissions standards for ""stationary"" greenhouse gas sources, such as power plants, in what the administration says is an effort to stem the effects of climate change and global warming. In the larger political sphere, this issue could be major test of executive authority, with many conservative groups painting President Barack Obama as misusing his power and ignoring the will of the legislature. Obama just last week announced new executive rules to extend carbon emission standards to larger trucks and buses. The White House said ongoing stalemates on Capitol Hill prompted the President to act. Republicans in Congress and their allies have expressed similar concerns over discretionary executive branch changes and delays in implementing the Obamacare health reform law, a tepid federal response to recent state marijuana legalization, and a refusal to defend a law that did not recognize legally-married same-sex couples for federal purposes. The high court last summer struck down that provision in the federal Defense of Marriage Act. The Supreme Court, in 2007, affirmed the conclusions by much of the scientific community that greenhouse gases-- including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions-- are an air pollutant, but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles. A range of business groups say the agency then improperly extended its regulatory authority to stationary sources. They worry the unchecked, expanded rules could someday apply to millions of other small carbon emitters -- schools, small businesses, and shopping malls. Defining ""air pollutant"" within the context of greenhouse gases -- and the ability of the EPA to exercise its rulemaking authority absent what it says was a clear congressional mandate -- took up much of the courtroom debate. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the half-dozen parties opposing the EPA cannot even agree on defining an ""air pollutant"" for regulatory purposes . ""That to me is the quintessential ambiguity in a statute where we give deference to the"" EPA, said Sotomayor. ""So if your side can't even come to one interpretation, why shouldn't we defer to the agency?"" But Justice Anthony Kennedy, who could prove the court's decisive fifth vote, bluntly addressed U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli. ""I have to say in reading the brief for the states and reading your brief, I couldn't find a single precedent that strongly supports your position,"" he said. Texas and 16 other the states in the South and Midwest were among the parties whose cases are under review by the high court. The justices had previously rejected three other related appeals, including one from Virginia -- broader challenges to the EPA's power over carbon emissions. A coalition of 15 states backs the White House. Some progressive groups worry the conservative majority Supreme Court has been overly friendly to corporate interests in recent years, and could rule in this case against the administration. But an outcome in this his case was not clear from the arguments. ""We have to think about it, along the parameter of separation of powers and whether the way in which the agency has perceived it here has arrogated an exceptional and troubling degree of discretion to design its own climate change program,"" Peter Keisler, the attorney representing the private groups bringing suit, told the court. Justice Elena Kagan, the most vocal backer of the administration, said the Clean Air Act was originally passed and amended before a clear understanding of the effect greenhouses gases were having on the planet. She said the EPA made a careful determination that they were different from pollution sources that cause breathing and other health problems, such as smog, and could apply different monitoring standards. ""What's happened here is that you have this new kind of emission that basically makes these two terms of the statute irreconcilable, and the agency has essentially picked one,"" said Kagan. ""It said: 'Look, we're not going to just exempt a broad class of pollutants. Instead, we're going to fudge the numbers.' And why isn't that the more reasonable of the two things to do?"" she asked. Verrilli made clear the stakes in his oral presentation, telling the court that greenhouse gas emissions are ""an urgent environmental"" issue. ""It's the gravest environmental problem that we face now as far as EPA's judgment, and it is one that gets worse with the passage of time,"" he said. But some justices questioned the agency's reach. ""Are greenhouse gases the only air pollutant for which EPA has the authority to change the statutory thresholds?"" asked Justice Samuel Alito. ""Could it do this for another pollutant, something other than any of the greenhouse gases?"" After Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts pressed the point, Verrilli suggested the EPA could broaden its discretionary authority, absent a specific congressional mandate. This is the second major environmental regulation case that will be heard this term. The justices in December heard arguments over the EPA's ability to measure emissions from an upwind state that is polluting a downwind state, requiring upwind states to pay for greenhouse gas reductions. A ruling in that case is still pending. Many business groups hope the conservative majority will limit the reach of government in this and a range of regulatory areas, which the Chamber of Commerce and others say is hurting the economy and stifling innovation. The cases argued Monday are Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. EPA (12-1272); Texas v. EPA (12-1269); Southeastern Legal Foundation v. EPA (12-1268); Energy-Intensive Manufacturers Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Regulation v. EPA (12-1254); American Chemistry Council v. EPA (12-1248); and Utility Air Regulatory Group v.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Mr. President, the midterm elections are over. You're out of excuses. Your stalling has worn thin. And the hour is late. It's time to keep your word and do what you promised to do before the end of summer â€” use the executive power of the presidency to fix part of the immigration system and offer relief to millions of undocumented immigrants. Of course, there's a lot of debate about what that ""fix"" would look like. You seem to be considering two specific goals: decreasing the number of deportations and strengthening border security. The former might mean giving temporary work permits to 1 or 2 million people. The latter is low-hanging fruit, since both Democrats and Republicans are always eager to throw money at the border by hiring more agents and building more walls. The trouble is that activists want a lot more -- a total moratorium on deportations, and the expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program beyond its intended beneficiaries (undocumented young people brought as children) to include the parents of DACA recipients and parents with U.S.-born children. They want work permits for as many as 4 or 5 million people. Frankly, as I've said before, I don't think any of this is going to happen. This week's election is over, but there's always another series of elections around the corner. Given that many Americans still resist the idea of rewarding illegal activity by conferring legal status to the undocumented, for other Democrats there would be a significant downside to using executive action. Who would worry? For one, probably Hillary Clinton, who is eager to run for president in 2016 but not eager to take the blame for executive action taken by the previous president. Besides, Mr. President, let's look at what you told reporters in this week's press conference. You said, ""I have no doubt that there will be some Republicans who are angered or frustrated by any executive action that I may take."" May take? Don't you mean ""will"" take? And, if I'm wrong and something does happen on the executive front, it likely won't be what immigration activists want. You might throw them a crumb, which the loyal Latino Democrats who have been apologists for your administration will generously declare a full loaf of bread. Time and again, you have held out the promise of executive action to Latino voters who want reform and who are furious at you for deporting a record 2 million people in five years. Those of us with long memories can appreciate the irony of this exercise given that you spent much of your first term arguing that you weren't ""a king"" and insisting you didn't have the executive power you now claim to be eager to use. Meanwhile, Mr. President, you've used the promise of executive action as a cynical ploy intended to distract critics and rally support for Democratic candidates for elective office. The sad part is that, for a while, it actually worked. But, take a look at the election returns. It's not working anymore. Hispanics never turn out in large numbers for midterm elections. Even so, this year's showing was weaker than usual. According to some exit polls, Hispanic voters made up only 8% of 2014 voters. It was 10% in 2012. This isn't surprising. If you want people to vote, you've got to get them excited and interested and vested in the outcome of the election. Democrats didn't do that with Latino voters. Perhaps that's because, in places like the South, they were busy impersonating Republicans. And speaking of the GOP, there's no argument that your loyal opposition is part of the problem. The day after retaking the Senate, they were already blasting away at what they're calling your planned ""executive amnesty."" What nonsense. For one thing, amnesty is a permanent legislative solution, and all the President has the power to do is offer temporary relief. For another, if Republicans are really that nervous about the President acting on his own on immigration reform, then they should do something they've been reluctant to do for decades â€” cobble together a bill that offers legal status to at least some of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Isn't that exactly what Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, recently predicted would happen if voters put the Senate back in the hands of Republicans? Well consider it done. Now, we might ask, where is the willingness on the part of GOP lawmakers to pass an immigration reform bill rather than continue to demagogue the issue? As with the White House, Republicans are out of excuses. Their stalling has worn thin. And the hour is late.","Ruben Navarrette: President Obama has no more excuse to not address immigration .

"Seoul (CNN) -- Choi Hyun Mi remembers her hands always ached in North Korea. ""The boxing gloves were just one thin layer of leather,"" Choi said.

For those who made it to international competitions, like the Asian Games being held in Incheon, South Korea, losing would mean much more than going hungry. ""There is a thing called 'ideological conflicts' where you are forced to stand up in front of a crowd in North Korea and everyone condemns you... you get denounced to an extent, that wow, you almost wouldn't be able to continue competing,"" Choi said.

Although her family may have less money in their new home, Choi knows she is far better off than the North Korean athletes competing at the Asian Games.

"(CNN) -- As the total death toll in Syria marches towards 40,000, the Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday lambasted the recent U.S. backing of Syria's opposition in its quest to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. Homs and Damascus are the deadliest places in Syria, according to an opposition group that keeps a running total of those whose lives came to a bloody end in 20-month armed conflict. Read more: Syrian opposition leader expects more from U.S. Of the 37,387 who have perished since fighting began, 6,992 were killed in Homs and 6,750 in the suburbs of Damascus, the Violations Documentation Center said.

Russia's Foreign Ministry published harsh criticism in its active Twitter feed of the recent show of support by the United States, France and Arab states around the Persian Gulf for fighters trying to topple Assad. ""The Syrian opposition has been given a false signal, strengthening the positions of extremists, including terrorists,"" a tweet reads. The ministry said the decision went against international principles on Syria established in Geneva. Quoting Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the ministry tweeted: ""If the priority is Assad's fate, it will be paid for with new casualties in #Syria. Our key priority is to prevent such sacrifices."" Lavrov met with the Gulf Cooperation Council in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Wednesday. Russia has shown support for its long-standing ally Assad, while the GCC openly backs the opposition. Both sides have been accused of supplying weapons to the conflict parties. The conflict raged on Thursday in Syria's perpetual flashpoints with no sign of losing intensity. The killing continues to drive civilians to flee over the country's borders. The U.N. refugee office says 414,838 Syrians are in neighboring countries registered as refugees or waiting to register. Turkey has the single highest number, with 114,944, it says. The Violations Documentation Center regularly publishes a meticulous tally of those who have been killed during Syria's armed conflict, claiming to include in its count only those whose deaths are documented on video or with an ID card. It works closely with the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a source commonly cited in reports on Syria. Both organizations support the overthrow of the Syrian government. The figures in their statistics will continue to rise.

"(CNN) -- The French Navy said they seized 11 pirates Sunday after they apparently mistook a French military vessel for a commercial ship and made a run at it. A French navy sailor speaks to one of 11 pirates on board the French warship the Nivose after their capture. Two pirate assault boats approached the Nivose ""at great speed,"" Capt. Christophe Prazuck said, but a French helicopter intervened before the attackers had time to fire at the French navy ship. The helicopter fired warning shots, he said. The pirates, who had a mother ship as well as the two assault boats, are being held for questioning on the Nivose, Prazuck said. The vessels were carrying AK-47 rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, but the pirates did not fire, he said. The incident took place about 1,000 km (620 miles) east of Mombasa, Kenya, at 8:30 a.m. local time (0430 GMT) he added. In the past three weeks, the Nivose has intercepted 24 suspected pirates as part of a European Union anti-piracy operation off the coast of Somalia, which has become a piracy hotspot. Over the past year, more than 100 suspected pirates have been picked up, Prazuck said. Of that total, 27 have been released, and more than 70 taken to jail in France, handed to authorities in Somalia or taken to Kenya under an EU agreement with the government in Nairobi. The Nivose seized three other suspected pirates Thursday morning, the French military spokesman said, but released them the next day for lack of evidence. But a day later, the Seychelles coast guard picked up the same three men. They claimed they were fishermen, but had no license to fish in the Seychelles exclusive economic zone, Prazuck said. Pirates seized a ship that was carrying wheat and used vehicles to Mogadishu, Somalia, on Saturday, according to NATO, which also patrols the area. The ship, the Almezaan, now appears to be heading for a Somali village called Harradera, known as a pirate base, Cmdr. Chris Davies told CNN. The ship did not send a distress signal until 4 a.m. Sunday, 18 hours after it was hijacked in the Indian Ocean, he said. No NATO ships were in the area at the time, he added. The Panamanian-flagged ship had a crew of 18 Indians as of April 2008, the last listing for it on the Web site of the International Transport Workers' Federation. Pirates also hijacked a British-owned bulk carrier in the Indian Ocean. The MV Ariana was carrying 35,000 tons of soya about 250 nautical miles (287 miles) northwest of the Seychelles when it was seized around dawn. The crew members are Ukrainians and they are not believed to be harmed, NATO said. It is unclear how many crew members were aboard the vessel and how it came to be attacked. NATO said it was unaware of ransom demands or any threats against those aboard. NATO said a European Union Protection Aircraft has been deployed to monitor and track the MV Ariana, which is making its way toward Somalia -- the epicenter of the pirate industry. Piracy has been soaring off the coast of eastern Africa -- particularly Somalia, which has not had an effective government since 1991. Somali pirates have defied foreign navies patrolling the waters and have collected large ransoms from shipping companies. Ransoms started out in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions. Journalist Ashleigh Nghiem contributed to this report.","French navy seizes 11 pirates after they threaten navy vessel .

"(CNN) -- The BBC is embroiled in a scandal that one of its veteran correspondents has called its worst crisis in nearly 50 years -- over its response to allegations that have turned a beloved on-air personality into one of the most reviled figures in the UK. Since his death a year ago at age 84, Jimmy Savile, the popular TV host, disc jockey and charity fundraiser has been knocked off his perch as a national treasure, accused of being a predatory pedophile who used his fame and position to abuse youngsters, sometimes on BBC premises. The corporation has been widely criticized for its handling of the crisis. British police say more than 200 possible victims have now been identified in what one officer Commander Peter Spindler said was ""alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale."" But who was Jimmy Savile and how did he become the eccentric star -- a cigar-smoking, jewel-encrusted, larger-than-life character who was rewarded with a knighthood for his charitable work? He mixed with British high society, and his death was greeted with sadness by many, including Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall. He was buried with customary glitz in a gold-colored coffin and with a green beret presented to him by the Royal Marines -- but his life began amid much humbler surroundings. Savile was born in Leeds in northern England on Halloween in 1926 and as a teenager conscripted to work as a coal miner during World War II -- these young wartime miners were known as the Bevin Boys. He was one of the surviving Bevin Boys who received an award from the then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown in 2008 for helping to keep the mines operational during the conflict. Savile suffered serious spinal injuries in a mine explosion and left the colliery but it doesn't appear to have stopped him from lifelong participation in sport. In the 1950s he took up wrestling and cycling, and he appeared regularly on British television running in marathons for charity even into his 70s. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper in 2000 he spoke of his love of sport. ""If you look at the athletics of it,"" he told the newspaper, ""I've done over 300 professional bike races, 212 marathons and 107 pro fights."" He proudly announced that he lost 35 of his first 35 fights. ""No wrestler wanted to go back home and say a long-haired disc jockey had put him down. So from start to finish I got a good hiding. I've broken every bone in my body. I loved it."" Cycling Weekly reported last year that he also had been a semi-professional cyclist and competed as Oscar 'The Duke' Savile in the 1951 Tour of Britain, and supported cycling charities most of his life. His broadcast career took off in the early 1960s but he said he had been playing records in dance halls from the mid-1940s, later claiming that he was the first to use the double-deck turntable, though commentators have pointed out that they were available decades earlier. He recalled selling just 12 tickets for his first show but said he enjoyed creating what he referred to as the ""atmosphere."" ""There was this amazing effect: what I was doing was causing 12 people to do something,"" he told DJHistory.com in 2004. ""My thrill is looking at them, and they're all doing what they're doing because I've just put this thing on. It's a hell of a thing,"" he said. He joined the independent station Radio Luxembourg as a DJ in 1958, but his big break came in 1964 when the BBC approached Savile to be the first host of ""Top of the Pops"" -- a show that became a huge hit for the BBC. It also began a 30-year TV career that was a showcase for his extravagant dress, yodels and catchphrases like ""Now then, now then, and ""How's about that then."" The BBC gave him his own show between 1975 and 1994 in which he helped hundreds of hopefuls, mostly children, fulfill their dreams to meet famous people and take part in stunts. ""Jim'll Fix It"" aired in the prime teatime slot on a Saturday, and at the height of its popularity, the BBC said it was receiving 20,000 requests a week. Famous fixes included an encounter with boxing legend Muhammad Ali and the boy scouts who wanted to eat their packed lunches on a roller coaster, resulting in a predictable mess. Generations of Britons also remember him for a string of public information films including a road safety promotion that encouraged motorists to use their seat belts -- a campaign that started before wearing belts became compulsory in the UK. Savile's closing catchphrase ""clunk click every trip"" was instantly memorable and caught on with the watching public. He also promoted the national rail network in a campaign dubbed ""This is the age of the train."" Savile was knighted in the 1990 Queen's Birthday Honors for ""charitable services,"" adding to the OBE (Order of the British Empire) he received in the 1970s, and he set up the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust. Savile was well-known for raising money through charity runs but also worked as a volunteer hospital porter and had a close association with the Stoke Mandeville Hospital spinal injuries unit. Stoke Mandeville's Jimmy's CafÃ©, named after the TV personality, has now been changed since the sex abuse scandal surfaced and following specific allegations widely reported in the British press that one of his alleged victims Caroline Moore, now 53, was sexually assaulted by Savile in a Stoke Mandeville corridor in 1971, when she was a 13-year-old patient. He told the BBC in 2000 that he had raised Â£40m ($64 million) for charity during his lifetime. In 1988 Savile was appointed to a senior role at Broadmoor Hospital -- a high security psychiatric hospital in England that treats some of the most dangerous men in the country -- a role that is now being investigated by the UK's Department of Health. The department says that in hindsight he should not have been appointed. Although he was perceived as an odd and eccentric character, the British public has been shocked by the allegations. The Savile family had his tombstone removed from his burial site out of ""respect to public opinion."" Dominic Sandbrook, author of a series of histories of modern Britain, told CNN: ""Because he was associated with the BBC, people trusted him and thought of him as a family-friendly face. He was a massive presence in the living rooms of millions of British families."" But when Jimmy Savile died, fellow BBC disc jockey Tony Blackburn hinted that he was an isolated figure, telling the BBC: ""He was just a complete one-off. I think he was a bit of a lonely character as well. In the privacy of his own life I don't think he had very many friends."" Film-maker Louis Theroux perhaps gained more of an insight into what many would regard as odd behavior. In a documentary made in 2000 he interviewed Savile in a flat where his mother had lived but still kept her clothing hanging in the wardrobe 27 years after her death. In the same program he also revealed that he only took a single pair of underpants with him when he went away and washed them in the sink every night. Despite hosting a children's show, Theroux asked him why he hated youngsters and he replied: ""We live in a very funny world and it's easier for me as a single man to say I don't like children because that puts a lot of salacious tabloid people off the hunt."" And when he was confronted about sexual abuse allegations in a 2007 radio interview, he brushed it off with a laugh, saying: ""What's the point of responding to something that's not true?"" The extensive investigations into Savile's behavior are only just beginning, but it appears his reputation as a fun-loving host of pop and a tireless charity worker are already ruined.","Flamboyant BBC TV host, who died in 2011, accused of being a prolific child abuser .

"(CNN) -- ISIS moved closer to seizing Kobani on Sunday as militants entered the southeastern edge of the Syrian city and street-to-street fighting began, a fighter and a media activist inside the city told CNN. The city's defenders were looking for ways to escape the Kurdish stronghold strategically located near the Turkish border, the fighter said. ""It's the last chance to leave,"" the fighter said. The fighter and media activist requested their names be withheld for security reasons. As night fell, the city grew quiet. Members of the Kurdish People's Protection Unit, called YPG, and other groups defending the city were unable to move because ISIS snipers were equipped with night vision equipment, the fighter said. The fighter said many city defenders close to the Turkish border attempted to cross into Turkey, while other fighters closer to ISIS positions were waiting until the morning to make a move. The importance of Kobani . ISIS has been trying to seize Kobani for weeks. The city is significant because ISIS wants to claim a swath of land running from its self-declared capital of Raqqa, Syria, on the Euphrates River to the Turkish border, more than 60 miles away. On Sunday, ISIS fighters overpowered Kurdish forces to take the top and the eastern side of Meshta Nour, the strategic hill overlooking Kobani, said the sources, who both requested their names be withheld for security reasons. A civilian source inside Kobani said there have been heavy clashes on all fronts around Kobani. He said ISIS forces had been moved back from a small corner of the city they'd held for two days. The YPG said in a statement that 86 ""terrorists"" were killed during a 24-hour period and 17 YPG members died. On Sunday, smoke billowed over Kobani as ISIS sent bombs into the middle of town. U.S., allies stage airstrikes . Kobani is now tightly surrounded in a crescent from the Aleppo road on the southwestern outskirts of the city all the way to the eastern edge of Kobani, near the Turkish border, the fighter and media activist said. ISIS is making inroads despite airstrikes by U.S. and allied forces, including Sunday's strikes on the eastern outskirts of the city. The YPG destroyed an ISIS tank in the east of Kobani near Kane Kordan, a large mound on the eastern of the city, the civilian source said. ISIS fighters are now about about one kilometer south on the Aleppo road, the civilian source said. Turkish security force throw teargas . Conflict occurred outside Kobani when Turkish security forces fired tear gas canisters at Kurds gathered near the border to watch the fighting from afar, CNN's Phil Black reported. Black said the security forces fired the tear gas when the crowds became restive or moved too close to the border. At least three canisters struck a CNN van, he said. Nobody was badly hurt and the crowds dispersed. Pakistani Talilban supports ISIS . ISIS picked up support when Pakistani Taliban spokesperson Shahidullah Shahid issued a statement backing ISIS. ""The Muslims of the world look to you with great expectation and in this difficult time we your mujahidin brothers are with you and will provide you with fighters and help,"" the statement said. Meanwhile, U.S. and allied military forces conducted three airstrikes against ISIS in Syria and six airstrikes in Iraq on Saturday and Sunday, U.S. Central Command reported. In Syria, one strike northwest of Al Mayadin destroyed an ISIS bulldozer, two tanks and another vehicle, the military said. Two strikes northwest of Ar Raqqah hit a large ISIS unit and destroyed six firing positions. In Iraq, four strikes northeast of Fallujah struck two mortar teams, a large ISIS unit and two small ISIS units, the military said. Three ISIS Humvees were destroyed with strikes near Hit and Sinjar. Australians complete first air mission . Australia has completed its first air combat mission over Iraq, the government announced Sunday in a press release. Two Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft conducted an air interdiction and close air support mission over northern Iraq and were on-call to attack targets if needed, the release said. The aircraft did not use their munitions and returned to base to disarm, the release said.

"(CNN) -- A key province near Iraq's capital is in trouble amid an onslaught from ISIS forces, the U.S. defense secretary said Friday, signaling the Islamist extremist group is continuing to flex its muscles and expand its territory -- on several fronts -- despite international airstrikes. Speaking to reporters during his travels in South America, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said there's a lot of uncertainty about what will happen with Anbar province, which is just west of Baghdad. These comments are in alignment with those of a senior U.S. defense official who told CNN that Iraqi forces are ""up against the wall"" in Anbar. Some units are in danger of being cut off by the advancing militants, who call themselves members of the Islamic State. The Iraqis' ultimate goal is to take back some of the vast areas, in both Iraq and Syria, that ISIS controls. But right now, Iraqi forces appear to be mostly trying to survive -- taking defensive positions and using Apache helicopters again, even after two were shot down in the area this week, according to the U.S. official. ""We do see ISIL continue to make gains in Anbar province and (are) mindful of how Anbar relates to the security of Baghdad,"" said another senior U.S. defense official. The first official said the U.S. military is more confident right now about the Iraqi military's ability to protect Baghdad. The Iraqi brigades defending the capital are more capable and include U.S. military advisers, so at least Washington should have a better sense there if there's any imminent danger. Abu Ahmed, a 42-year-old colonel who belongs to a group allied with the Iraqi government, said that ""a large number of ISIS militants"" attacked al-Garma, in Anbar province, around 3 a.m. Friday. What began with the detonation of seven vehicles by a bridge ended about five hours later. In between, Ahmed said there was ""a fierce battle"" with ISIS militants on one side and Iraqi and local allied forces on the other. ""During the fight, ISIS militants set some oil containers and tires on fire to block the view from the Iraqi air support that was called in,"" Ahmed said. ""... The Iraqi army and Awakening Council fighters did not advance to the positions where ISIS militants were fighting, fearing booby traps and planted (improvised explosive devices)."" This is not the only place where ISIS forces are fighting. Oil and crime make ISIS rich . About 800 kilometers (500 miles) from Baghdad, the Islamist extremist group continued to inch forward in the Syrian city of Kobani. The Kurdish enclave has been a hotspot for days, largely due to its location a stone's throw from the Turkish border. Emotional and, at times, violent protests have broken out in Turkey among people calling for ground forces to intervene -- something Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Thursday won't happen, so long as Turkey has to go it alone. Turkey's tough choice: Take on ISIS or the PKK? ISIS fighters controlled about half of the Syrian city on Friday, significantly more than even a day earlier, after taking over Kurdish administration buildings in what had been a security zone, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports. The United States has launched multiple airstrikes to try to curb the ISIS advance, including two Friday that the U.S. military says destroyed some of the group's infrastructure and vehicles. But such efforts haven't prevented ISIS fighters from restocking with munitions from the Syrian cities of Aleppo and Raqqa, according to the observatory, a London-based monitoring group. Nor have they stopped fresh fighters from arriving in Kobani, which is also known as Ayn al-Arab. The group that could help beat ISIS .

"St. Louis, Missouri (CNN) -- An employee at a transformer manufacturing company opened fire on his co-workers Thursday, killing three people before turning the gun on himself, police said. Five other ABB Inc. employees were wounded in the shooting in the company's factory in St. Louis, police said. A law enforcement official identified the suspect as Timothy Hendron. Hendron is among a group of ABB employees listed in a lawsuit filed in 2006 against administrators of the company's retirement plan. The suit, filed in federal court, accuses the administrators of, among other things, causing the plan to include ""unreasonable and excessive"" fees and expenses, paid by participants, without their knowledge and not used for their benefit or that of the plan. Linda Siegfried, a spokesman for the law firm representing the plaintiffs, confirmed to CNN that Hendron was among the plaintiffs, although his name is spelled three different ways in court documents. A trial on the matter is taking place in Kansas City, Missouri, Siegfried said. She didn't know whether Hendron would have been required to be present. Online federal court records show the trial began Tuesday. Siegfried would not comment further except to say the firm offers its concern for the welfare of the victims. The shooting occurred just before 6:30 a.m. Arriving officers were told that a man had entered the building with a rifle and a handgun, and that several people had been shot, police said. ""Police made a perimeter around the business and located those victims who needed medical attention,"" a St. Louis Metropolitan Police statement said. Of the five at area hospitals, three victims were in critical condition and two in fair condition, police said. KSDK: Four dead, five wounded at ABB Power . Authorities conducted a room-to-room search of the large building, as well as surrounding buildings at the ABB complex, the statement said. Interstate 70 and surface streets in the area were initially shut down. ABB spokesman Bob Fesmire said earlier that about 100 employees work at the facility, but some of them were unable to come in Thursday because of heavy snow. CNN's Kara Devlin, Ashley Hayes and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: Timothy Hendron opened fire on co-workers, turned gun on himself, police say .

"London, England (CNN) -- A long-awaited inquiry into Britain's role in the Iraq war got under way Tuesday -- a process that could determine whether former Prime Minister Tony Blair misled his country over the 2003 invasion. The inquiry is expected to be the most thorough investigation yet into the decisions that led up to the war and governed Britain's involvement, analysts said. It is not a court of law, so the inquiry cannot find anyone criminally responsible or even apportion blame. But inquiry members will be able to judge the legality of the conflict. ""The Iraq Inquiry was set up to identify the lessons that should be learned from the UK's involvement in Iraq, to help future governments who may face similar situations,"" inquiry Chairman John Chilcot said at the opening of the hearings Tuesday. ""To do this, we need to establish what happened."" Chilcot, a senior civil servant, said on the eve of the hearings that the committee is ""completely determined"" to write the full story of Iraq war decision-making by the British government using all the evidence it can get. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who announced the inquiry in June, has promised the committee will have access to the full range of information, including secret documents, in order to identify lessons that can be learned from the war. The inquiry officially began July 30, but Tuesday was the first day of hearings, which are expected to last into the new year. The hearings were initially going to be held behind closed doors, but after criticism the government decided to allow the hearings to be public and televised. The committee has said it will decide on a case-by-case basis whether to keep the hearings private when discussing sensitive or classified information. Blair will be called to testify, Chilcot said earlier this year, and the former prime minister has said he will appear. Other witnesses will be key decision-makers involved in Iraq, Chilcot has said. Chilcot has said the panel members plan to visit Iraq as part of their work, as well as hold discussions with Iraqis outside of the country. Top officials from the British and U.S. governments also might be called on for evidence, he said. Britain has already held four hearings about the Iraq war. But because all were held before the end of 2004 -- so close to the start of the war -- they were hampered by limited information, political analyst Glen Rangwala of Cambridge University told CNN. ""They didn't manage to achieve anything like a comprehensive understanding of the paths that led the UK to support the United States in the invasion,"" he said. ""This will be the first to look at political decision-making that led to the British invasion of 2003, with the potential to tell a full story."" People involved in those decisions are more likely to testify now than they were a few years ago, Rangwala said. That partly because British troops are no longer involved in combat in Iraq, but also because the war there is no longer the politicized issue it was when Blair was in power, he said. ""The sort of political sting has been taken out of it, and people who are presenting their evidence to the (inquiry) won't feel quite so constrained by the political line, or the party line, than they would have a few years ago,"" he said. Britain's first two inquiries were held by government committees in 2003. The House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs examined whether Britain's Foreign Office gave accurate and complete information to Parliament in the run-up to the war. It found the government exerted no improper influence on the drafting of the dossier given to Parliament on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction. The Intelligence and Security Committee then examined whether intelligence about Iraq and its weapons was properly assessed and accurately reflected in government publications. Its findings were mixed. The next two inquiries had narrow mandates, looking at specific aspects of the war. The Hutton report from January 2004 investigated the death of David Kelly, a leading microbiologist and former U.N. weapons inspector who committed suicide months earlier. Kelly had worked for the British Ministry of Defence, advising it on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, but was later found to be the source of a BBC report that said the government had exaggerated evidence to justify war on Iraq. Following that came the Butler inquiry, which looked at the accuracy of intelligence on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and elsewhere. It found some of the intelligence sources were ""seriously flawed,"" but that there was no evidence of deliberate distortion or culpable negligence by spy agencies.","Hearings begin in UK Iraq Inquiry to determine legality of the Iraq War .

"(CNN) -- In the fight against Ebola, Australia has said: No thanks. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison announced ""strong controls"" on arrivals from West African countries affected by cases of the deadly disease. Telling Australia's parliament during a question time session Monday that his ministry was currently ""not processing any application from these (Ebola) affected countries,"" he said that the government was also suspending its humanitarian program. He added that holders of permanent Australian visas based in these countries would be subject to a mandatory, three-week quarantine process prior to their departure. Visitors approved to travel to Australia will also face further screening and followup checks upon arrival. The announcement came as a ""surprise,"" the Australian Medical Association (AMA) president Brian Owler told CNN, who said that the chance of the disease entering the country through a migrant from the region was very low. ""It's not necessarily a very well-focused decision. The bigger picture needs to be on our preparedness at home but more importantly our involvement in West Africa itself, putting doctors and nurses and other logistical elements in place and trying to combat the crisis there."" He added that the government had sought the advice of ""very few people,"" and had excluded the AMA. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: ""I not always agree with the Australian Medical Association, but I take them seriously and I think that the AMA invariably has the national interest at heart."" The announcement that no refugees will be accepted from West Africa must be overturned, the Australian Greens have said. ""While the government drags its feet in responding to the Ebola crisis, Scott Morrison has slammed the door on West African refugees,"" the Greens' immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said. ""The immigration minister's crusade against those in need has spread to West Africa and is simply unacceptable. ""This miserly, selfish and cruel announcement from the government is not a reflection of our nation's character."" 'Make advice public' The main opposition party called on the government to make the advice that informed its policy public. ""We want the government to release the advice on which this decision has been made,"" Labor's foreign affairs spokesman Matt Thistlethwaite said. ""We need to be absolutely certain that this government isn't being tough but dumb when it comes to protecting Australians from the risk of Ebola infection at home,"" Thistlethwaite was quoted by the ABC as saying. Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan told CNN's Richard Quest that isolationism was not the answer to the current health crisis. ""The doctors from (the) WHO, to the CDC here and other countries have indicated that the worst thing you want to do is close off the borders and come up with this sort of restrictions and scare away potential help,"" he said. ""Our concern should be with the public safety and public health but we have to accept that the only way we can deal with it in the medium to long term is to stop the epidemic."" Concerns are being raised that the Australian response is largely engineered to create political capital, particularly given the country's well-documented hard line on immigration. ""There have been people here in Australia that have been asking for this kind of approach and I think the main drive is political,"" Owler said. ""Of course it will always be dressed up as a solution to keeping Australians safe but in actual fact the people who are coming from West Africa, a number of them are coming on humanitarian grounds so there are concerns about why their visas are being denied, and for what period of time they'll be denied for."" The nonprofit Medicines Sans Frontiers, also known as Doctors Without Borders, echoed the sentiment, saying that ""developed countries' prevention strategies ... seem to have more political than medical implications."" Abbott defended the government's decision, pointing to an AUS $18 million ($15.9 million) investment to combat the spread of the disease in West Africa, saying his ""government are taking very serious steps to address the Ebola crisis."" He added that the Australian authorities ""are continuing to talk to our friends and partners about what more might be done to address the situation in West Africa,"" and that he did ""not rule out Australia doing more."" The Australian move follows North Korea's tourist ban, also instigated over fears of the spread of the disease.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Joe Biden on Tuesday said he can't believe President Bush hasn't known for months about a recent intelligence estimate that downplays the nuclear threat from Iran. Other Democratic candidates also slammed Bush for continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric against Tehran. On Tuesday the president acknowledged he had given a speech warning that Iran's nuclear development risked ""World War III"" about two months after his intelligence chief told him a reassessment of Tehran's nuclear ambitions was under way. Bush told reporters during a White House news conference that he was not told the details of the new assessment until last week and he said the new report, which found that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons work in 2003, will not change U.S. policy toward Iran. ""Iran was dangerous, Iran is dangerous and Iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon,"" Bush said, pointing out that Tehran continues to try to enrich uranium for civilian purposes and therefore develop technology that could be used for a weapon. ""They had the program. They halted the program. It's a warning signal because they could restart it,"" he said.  Watch Bush's credibility questioned » . Bush told reporters that he was told of ""new information"" about Iran in August during a briefing by Adm. Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence. ""He didn't tell me what the information was. He did tell me it was going to take a while to analyze,"" the president said. He said he wasn't briefed about the new information until the new intelligence report was prepared last week. The Democratic presidential candidates were incredulous that Bush did not know about the assessment's new finding. Biden, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called that explanation ""unbelievable."" ""Are you telling me a president that's briefed every single morning, who's fixated on Iran, is not told back in August that the tentative conclusion of 16 intelligence agencies in the U.S. government said they had abandoned their effort for a nuclear weapon in '03?"" Biden asked in a conference call with reporters. ""I refuse to believe that,"" he added. ""If that's true, he has the most incompetent staff in modern American history, and he's one of the most incompetent presidents in modern American history."" The Bush administration has spent years warning that Iran's development of nuclear power plants and enriched uranium masked an effort to produce an atomic bomb. Top officials have called the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran ""unacceptable."" In an October 17 news conference, Bush said that ""If you're interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon."" And four days later, Vice President Dick Cheney told a Washington think tank that Iran would face ""serious consequences"" from the international community if it continued to enrich uranium. But in a report released Monday, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Iran had suspended nuclear weapons work in 2003 and was unlikely to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb until at least 2010. The assessment reverses a 2005 National Intelligence Estimate that found the Islamic republic was ""determined to develop nuclear weapons despite its international obligations and international pressure.""  See how the 2005 and 2007 estimates differ » . The United States and its European allies are pushing for tighter sanctions against Tehran as a result of that continued refusal, and Bush said Monday's report ""makes it clear that the strategy we have used in the past is effective."" But Biden said Monday's report was an unpleasant echo of the run-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- a war that was launched based on mistaken conclusions about Iraq's weapons programs. He said the result of Bush's rhetoric has been to make it ""far more difficult"" to round up support for continued sanctions on Tehran. ""It's hard to think of a more serious and more self-inflicted wound to our national security than this president continues to inflict,"" Biden said. Republican National Committee spokesman Brian Walton accused Biden of trying to bolster his own presidential campaign. ""Apparently Joe Biden has seen recent polling that shows his statistical insignificance and is looking for relevance in the debate by offering heated rhetoric,"" Walton said. Biden and other Democrats now hoping to replace Bush after 2008 used the report to call for new talks with Iran over the nuclear issue, offering the prospect of renewed economic and diplomatic ties in exchange for a halt to uranium enrichment. ""I think we do know that pressure on Iran does have an effect,"" Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-New York, said during a Democratic debate Tuesday held by National Public Radio. ""I think that is an important lesson. But we're not going to reach the kind of resolution that we should seek unless we put that into the context of a diplomatic process."" And Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois, told the same forum that Bush ""continues to not let facts get in the way of his ideology."" ""They should have stopped the saber rattling; should have never started it. And they need, now, to aggressively move on the diplomatic front,"" he said. But national security adviser Stephen Hadley said Monday that Bush was not told to tone down his rhetoric about Iran's nuclear ambitions when advised that a change in the U.S. estimate was coming -- and would have made his remarks about ""World War III"" either way. ""It was making a point that the president and we have been making for two or three years -- that the international community has to exert more pressure, because Iran needs to suspend [its] enrichment program,"" Hadley said. ""That continues to be our policy after this latest National Intelligence Estimate."" And Bush said the new estimate ""doesn't do anything to change my opinion about the danger Iran poses to the world -- quite the contrary.""

"(CNN) -- People hurled stones and eggs at the Kosovan prime minister's convoy this week, a spurt of violence just days before the one-time Serbian province holds its first elections since declaring independence. The flare-up Wednesday targeted Prime Minister Hashim Thaci in the western town of Decan. It unsettled the Balkan country and international officials looking forward to peaceful local elections on Sunday in a land scarred by conflict and now slowly on the mend. There will be races in 36 municipalities for mayors and assembly members, with more than 1.5 million people eligible to vote. December 13 has been set as the day for any second round of mayoral elections that may be needed. ""Intervening in the election process is a serious violation and criminal acts which are politically incited will be prosecuted by relevant legal bodies,"" said the Kosovo government in a statement posted on Thaci's Web site. While saying the campaign season has been ""largely free of violence,"" the U.S. Embassy in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, noted the disturbance ""with distress"" and called on ""political leaders, parties and activists to refrain from all violence and provocations."" Kosovo has long been a restive province of Serbia with a majority ethnic Albanian population. The Kosovo government estimates the country's population at more than two million, with an estimated 92 percent Albanian, 5.3 percent Serbs, and 2.7 percent other groups. Serbian-Albanian sectarian tension boiled over as the former Yugoslavia broke up in the 1990s. After the brutal civil war in Kosovo in the late 1990s, which pitched Kosovo Albanian insurgents against Serb security forces and Belgrade-backed Kosovo Serb paramilitaries, the country began operating under a U.N. mission and a NATO-led peacekeeping force. As the aggressor, Serbia under Slobodan Milosevic had endured months of intense NATO bombing. Milosevic later died after a heart attack as he awaited trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Hague. The ethnic-Albanian majority eventually declared the province independent in February 2008, but Serbia and many ethnic Serbs staunchly opposed the move. They regard Kosovo as Serbian territory and refuse to recognize its sovereignty. Next month, at the International Court of Justice, Serbia is expected to challenge Kosovo's independence -- recognized by the United States and other countries and entities. There also has been talk of an election boycott by the minority Serbian population, with the logic being that participation would be a tacit recognition of Kosovo's independence. But Kosovo and its backers in the international community want the native Serbs to embrace the new country. President Fatmir Sejdiu hailed a call from 100 Serb intellectuals urging Kosovo Serbs to take part in the elections and countered those Serbian voices he says are discouraging Kosovo Serbs from going to the polls. ""I invite all the members of Serb community who are citizens and residents of Kosovo to get involved in all fields of social and public lives. This would be to the benefit of us all, to the benefit of each family and to the benefit of all citizens,"" he said Thursday. International officials are heartened by the participation of many non-Albanian entities -- such as political parties and independent candidates. The election commission says of the 74 certified political entities in the races, 34 are Albanian, 22 Serbian, and the rest various other ethnicities -- Bosnian, Turkish, Ashkali, Montenegrin, Egyptian, Gorani, and Roma. U.S. Ambassador to Kosovo Christopher W. Dell says there's a ""growing recognition"" of the elections' benefits. He cites the goal of decentralization, an effort to give Albanians, Serbs and others the power ""to assume responsibility for organizing themselves, for running their own local governments."" ""I believe the November elections are a critical opportunity for the Kosovo Serb community to assume much greater control of the day-to-day running of their own lives in ways that really matter,"" Dell said in a speech last month. And there is optimism as well about the significance of the election process. It's the first time Kosovo is organizing any elections itself, Dell said, with Kosovo and its Central Election Commission -- not the United Nations or the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe -- ""running the show."" Edita Bucaj, acting spokeswoman for the Kosovo mission of the OSCE, told CNN that the ""general impression is that the campaign has been relatively calm."" The OSCE -- which had been organizing all elections in Kosovo since 2000 and now provides technical support and advice to Kosovo's Central Election Commission, ""would certainly like to see an orderly process without incident on Sunday,"" Bucaj said. Janusz Bugajski -- who holds the Lavrentis Lavrentiadis chair and is director of the New European Democracies Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington -- said the ""local elections are politically and internationally significant in the evolution of the new state."" In remarks published by CSIS on Thursday, Bugajski said Kosovo has growing pains, the kind ""newly emergent states"" have in their early stages. He cites ""inadequate administrative capabilities, limited oversight of governmental bodies, and inability to deliver essential services to the citizens."" ""Kosovo also has additional problems in that Pristina does not control the entire territory, has a rudimentary security structure, and remains largely dependent on international institutions,"" he said. But, Bugajski said, the elections ""will indicate Kosovo's commitment to democratic principles"" and help opponents of Kosovo's independence realize ""that a stable emerging democracy at the heart of the Balkans contributes to regional stability."" And, keeping radicalism at bay during ""difficult economic times"" will be the country's ""major challenge in the year ahead."" ""A free and fair election in a competitive political climate is the most effective way to demonstrate that Kosovo seeks to be a full member of the international community,"" he said.","More than 1.5 million people are eligible to vote in 36 municipalities for mayors and assembly members in Kosovo .

"(CNN) -- Abandoned workshops and empty warehouses are getting a new lease of life in Cape Town. Spaces that once housed production lines are now becoming creative hotspots for artists, designers and musicians living in a city that holds the title of World Design Capital for 2014. This urban regeneration might be most true in one of Cape Town's oldest suburbs: Woodstock. Visitors to the area can see the busy harbor to the north and the majestic Table Mountain to the south. But most people wandering around the area aren't here for the views -- with its craft stores, art markets, theaters and award-winning restaurants, this is a hot address for young urbanites. Based here is also the Old Biscuit Mill, a converted building that has now become a hive of retail activity. ""When we started we knew we had made the best decision to be based in Woodstock specifically,"" says Zizi Poswa, a founding partner of Imiso Ceramics, a well-known local pottery collective located at the Old Biscuit Mill. ""After two or three years we realized we've got to maximize on whatever we do and we've had a lot of customers coming from overseas to see our work. It's been good."" Woodstock is also home to an old brewery that has now been turned into an office hub, mostly catering for small advertising and film production firms. ""Buildings in the area really lend themselves to being converted,"" says Willem Otten, one of the architects involved in the redesign of the Old Castle Brewery. ""Woodstock used to have a lot of clothing workshops and factories, so the high ceilings and generous spaces really work for the artistic community."" Economic benefits . This sector is an important component of South Africa's economy. The visual arts contribute nearly $90 million to the country's GDP and provide employment to almost 18,000 people, according to the Department of Arts and Culture. But the craft sector is even more significant when it comes to generating income. The sector contributes about $985 million annually to GDP and employs approximately 38,000 people. South Africa's government is trying to build on these areas with its Public Art Program. Minister of Arts and Culture Paul Mashatile has announced a number of partnerships with local community leaders and artists in a bid to stimulate creativity in communities and help beautify areas. Overall, the program is projected to create 5,000 short-term jobs between 2013 and 2015. One person who is well-aware of the economic potential South African design has to offer is Trevyn McGowan. The company she started with her husband, ""Source,"" is all about finding local designers and getting them started in the global market. ""Our design industry is ready,"" says McGowan, who's also the founder of the Southern Guild -- a stable of local talent creating design art and investment pieces. ""A cool market, but in a commercial environment."" Design legacy . Her goal is to stimulate the industry and the majority of the work is happening in Woodstock. The regeneration of the area is one of the reasons that the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design has crowed Cape Town the World Design Capital -- a title the city will hold until the end of the year. Past title holders that have received recognition for driving urban development through design include Finland's capital city Helsinki and Seoul in South Korea. Cape Town is the first city on the African continent to have been given the title, which was first bestowed on Torino in Italy in 2008. But has the title led to real benefits for the city? ""There has been a fantastic response,"" says Otten. ""There has been an uplifting of the city as people are really making public spaces better."" But there is a sense that the real benefits won't be immediately obvious. ""I think this is far more intrinsic and deeper than anybody anticipates and it's only going to be in years to come that we really see the critical impact that world design capital has had on Cape Town,"" says McGowan. ""It's all very well to want the proof right here and right now but for a young industry, we're really are doing the best we can and the legacy that's going to be left behind after the year is over."" This longer-term perspective is also on the mind of Alayne Reesberg, CEO of World Design Capital Cape Town -- the body which implements the requirements of the World Design Capital organization. ""There has been added impetus in 2014 for South African policy-makers to talk about design,"" she says. ""City, provincial and national government agencies are convening on design issues and the WDC title has really accelerated those conversations."" As the end of 2014 comes into sight, and with it the close of Cape Town's reign as World Design Capital, citizens will hope the year in the spotlight will have a lasting impact on the city's public spaces.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- NATO forces in Afghanistan are investigating a report that a NATO airstrike killed Afghan security forces in a region rife with arms smuggling and narcotics trafficking. Afghanistan's Defense Ministry issued a statement saying seven Afghan security forces died and Afghan and international forces were injured in the Saturday incident, which occurred in Badghis province -- a swath of territory in western Afghanistan bordering Turkmenistan. This is where NATO forces have launched a search for two American paratroopers who went missing Wednesday during a ""routine resupply mission."" The pair -- from the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division -- are operating under NATO's International Security Assistance Force. The service members disappeared near Afghanistan's border with Turkmenistan, in the Badghis town of Bala Morghab, said Sayed Ahmad Sami, the provincial police chief. ISAF and Afghan security forces personnel casualties were reported on Friday in several incidents during the search operation, a statement from ISAF said. Four Afghan soldiers, three police and an Afghan civilian working with the army were killed. Fifteen Afghan soldiers, two Afghan police, five U.S. service members under ISAF, and a civilian working with Afghan troops were wounded, the statement said. In another incident in Badghis nearly two weeks ago, seven U.S. service members and three U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officers were killed in a helicopter crash in the province. Low visibility was cited as the cause of the crash.","Afghan Defense Ministry: Seven Afghan security forces died, Afghan and international forces hurt .

"(CNN) -- Rapper MC Hammer launched a string of tweets Saturday with his side of the story two days after he was arrested in northern California for allegedly obstructing an officer. Among his tweets, Hammer said, apparently referring to the arresting officer, that he was asked whether he was on parole or probation before the man tried to pull him out of his vehicle Thursday night. Police in Dublin, east of Oakland, said Hammer was in a vehicle with expired registration and he was not the registered owner. ""After asking Hammer who the registered owner was he became very argumentative and refused to answer the officer's questions,"" police spokesman Herb Walters wrote Saturday evening in an e-mail to CNN. Hammer -- a rap and dance icon in the late 1980s and 1990s -- was arrested on suspicion of resisting an officer and obstructing an officer in the performance of his duties, according to police spokesman Herb Walters. The incident occurred at the Hacienda Crossings shopping center. Hammer began his tweets Saturday with ""chubby elvis looking dude was tapping on my car window, I rolled down the window and he said 'Are you on parole or probation?'"" ""While I was handing him my ID he reached in my car and tried to pull me out the car but forgot he was on a steady donut diet,"" Hammer continued. ""It was comical to me until he pulled out his guns, blew his whistle and yelled for help (MallCop) !!! But make no mistake he's dangerous."" Hammer, 50, was booked and released on bail from Santa Rita Jail, Walters said. A court date is next month, and police have until that time to decide on any charges. No drugs or alcohol were suspected in the incident, police said. In another tweet, Hammer, born Stanley Kirk Burrell, said, ""only thing more dangerous than a scared man with a gun, is a scared man with an agenda, a gun and a badge."" ""I will now answer his question, contrary to his personal beliefs, all people of color are not on parole or probation fat boy!!!,"" wrote Hammer, later adding he thought of his arrest as ""a teachable moment"" and an ""eye opener."" Hammer, who had a hit single in 1990 with ""U Can't Touch This,"" has been enjoying a resurgence in his career and took the stage with ""Gangnam Style"" Korean performer Psy during the American Music Awards last November. Hammer performed ""Too Legit to Quit,"" which was released more than 20 years ago.

"(CNN) -- Of the two of us, Linda is the fan of professional football. And every football fan realizes football games are extremely violent. We are both also feminists. And every feminist knows the women's movement denounces all forms of violence. For a woman who is a football fan, this can be hard to reconcile. So it was surprising to turn on the TV and find these opposing mindsets coexisting on the football field: Tough, hyper-masculine football players were wearing pink, a color associated with women and girls, femininity -- and sometimes vulnerability -- and also widely known to represent breast cancer. Who could not be delighted, at first, to see such an apparent break in gender stereotypes? The NFL, it seems, has officially teamed up with the American Cancer Society with the ""A Crucial Catch"" campaign throughout October to fundraise and spread awareness about breast cancer. The campaign encourages women to get mammograms annually (even though the current state of knowledge is that screening benefits fewer and harms more women than once believed). Does anyone doubt that the NFL's support of breast cancer awareness is mainly a strategy designed to give the impression that the NFL cares about women, and generate more female football fans? After all, from a public relations perspective, the pink ribbon is worth its weight in gold. Breast cancer has been the cause of choice for corporate marketers for almost two decades, sure to draw a crowd and profits. But there is another women's issue, domestic violence, that touches many women and men, some of whom are professional football players. This, too, is an issue that would resonate with fans. And as it happens, ""Pinkotober"" is also Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Might the NFL throw the power of its brand behind this problem? It would be a profound gesture from a perfect pulpit. After all, the most recent high-profile discussions in America about domestic violence have centered on the violent actions of Ray Rice, Baltimore Ravens' running back, who was suspended from play when a video was released showing him punching and knocking out his future wife. But Rice is by no means the only professional football player identified as a batterer. Even in very recent NFL history, again and again other star players have been implicated in violence in their personal lives, including Vikings running back Adrian Peterson; San Francisco 49ers' defensive end Ray McDonald, who was arrested last weekend on felony domestic violence charges; and Denver Broncos' wide receiver Rod Smith, to name only a few. The incidence of intimate partner abuse in the United States is alarmingly high: One out of three women experiences this kind of violence, according to the American Psychological Association and World Health Organization. Since this violence is committed primarily by men, it can accurately be described as a men's issue, too. Think of the impact of having a bastion of hyper-masculinity, like the NFL, shining a light on it. Of course the NFL has long been reluctant to focus on domestic violence. Even a recent set of PSA's on the issue have been late in coming, short in duration and far from enough. Indeed, the league has repeatedly avoided, minimized and downplayed players' aggression on and off the field, responding only when negative press refuses to die down -- as in NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's finally admitting, weeks after revelations about the Ray Rice abuse incident, that he'd handled it poorly. ESPN's live feed of Goodell's remarks revealed a stream of Twitter comments from players themselves who found his mea culpa to be pointless. This avoidance may be an attempt to manage public opinion. It might also be based in something psychologists call a shield of denial. Simply speaking, denial is necessary for effective human functioning, to provide psychological protection from thoughts and feelings, such as the prospect of death, too devastating to contemplate for prolonged periods. Shielding oneself in denial enables a person to get on with life, or with the game or the season. There is nothing unusual about this human process; people prefer to feel good, not bad. But there are moments when it's important, even necessary, to examine individual and cultural ideas instead of denying them. The painful truth about domestic violence is that it is harmful and terrifying and forces individuals to face an agonizing reality. Under a shield of denial, people predictably avoid the emotional pain of realizing that domestic violence is going on all around us, including in the NFL itself. But by staying shielded, by not speaking out against men's violence against women, we quietly accept it. This is untenable. There is a purple ribbon to denote Domestic Violence Awareness, but there is no ubiquitous ribbon culture to gather around. The NFL can help. For the NFL to show it is serious about supporting women, why not lower the shield of denial about domestic violence and put the issue out there before the fans?","Gayle Sulik, Linda Rubin: NFL observing Breast Cancer Awareness in October .

Hisham Talaat Moustafa, a real estate mogul, has been found guilty of Suzanne Tamim's murder. The case, with its high-profile victim and defendant, has captivated Egypt and the region. A judge convicted and sentenced to death real estate mogul Hisham Talaat Moustafa and the former officer Muhsen el Sukkari on Thursday. Egypt's Grand Mufti -- the country's highest religious official -- will review the sentence and rule on June 25 if the men will be executed, the judge said. Because the two men were sentenced under Islamic law, it is widely expected that they would be hanged. Mustafa's lawyer told reporters outside the courtroom that he will appeal the conviction, saying there was ""a one million percent guarantee"" the sentence would be overturned. The singer, Suzanne Tamim, was found slain in her apartment in the United Arab Emirates. She had been stabbed and her throat slit. Prosecutors alleged that Moustafa, a parliament member for the ruling National Democratic Party, paid el Sukkari $2 million to kill Tamim. During the trial, Moustafa's lawyer told CNN his client loved the singer, but could not take Tamim as a second wife because his family objected. Polygamy is legal in Egypt, and it's not unusual for men -- such as Moustafa, a married father of three -- to take on additional wives. Prosecutors have said Tamim's death was a ""means of taking revenge,"" but have not elaborated. Moustafa and el Sukkari claim the prosecution's evidence could have been fabricated or tampered with by UAE authorities and should not be used against them. Although Tamim was killed in the United Arab Emirates, the Egyptian judiciary tried the case in Cairo because the accused were arrested in Egypt. After his arrest in September, Egyptian authorities indicted Moustafa, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and jailed him pending trial. He also resigned as chairman of Talaat Moustafa Group -- a conglomerate with construction and real estate arms that was founded by his father, Talaat Moustafa. Moustafa's brother, Tarek Talaat Moustafa, now chairs the company.

"(CNN) -- Sweden's military feels certain there was an intruder, but it has called off the search for a mystery vessel in waters near Stockholm. ""At least one"" foreign vessel was there, Swedish Rear Adm. Anders Grenstad said Friday. ""It may have been a small vessel."" Whatever may have been lurking beneath the waves of the archipelago for a week drew threats of martial force from Sweden's military. A spokeswoman warned that the navy was ""prepared to use anything necessary"" to force the vessel to rise to the surface. The military used battleships, minesweepers and helicopters in the search. Government officials have not said what they believed they had detected, but Sweden's media reported the military was probably looking for a Russian submarine. Report: Russian signal . Swedish intelligence had picked up a radio distress call last week -- in Russian -- which set off the defensive reconnaissance, major daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported. The transmissions were directed at the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, 330 miles (530 kilometers) south of Stockholm, on the Baltic's southern shore, The Local reported. Moscow said it had no vessel in Swedish waters and suggested Sweden ask the Netherlands if it was one of theirs stationed nearby. The Netherlands is a member of a NATO and an ally of Sweden's, which does not belong to the alliance. According to a report, the Dutch said they did not had a sub in Swedish waters. Russia has recently flexed its muscles at Sweden, which has been cooperating recently more closely with NATO, security expert Gary Schmitt wrote in an analysis for CNN. Moscow has practiced mock attacks of Stockholm and has flown very close to Swedish planes and ships, he said. It has also encroached upon Swedish airspace. Tourist sub mix-up . The mystery had unpleasant side effects for tour guide Lasse Schmidt. He putters around the archipelago with tourists in a small decommissioned military sub originally designed as a target for naval battle exercises. And the national defense stir had some of his countrymen gunning for him. They thought his submersible was what the navy detected as a potential intruder. The news of the military's search had Schmidt's business phone ringing, mostly with annoying calls. ""Many people believe we caused this military operation,"" he said, ""and they call to demand that we pay the bill for it.""

"(CNN) -- Russia Today, RT for short, is funded by its namesake government, even promoted as a top media source on the foreign ministry's website. Its own site contains story after story defending and explaining Moscow's take on world crises -- chief among them now, what's unfolding in Ukraine. The Columbia Journalism Review notes it is best ""known as an extension of former President Vladimir Putin's confrontational foreign policy."" In other words, it's about the last place you'd expect to hear these words: ""What Russia did is wrong."" Yet that is exactly what one of RT's anchors, Abby Martin, said Monday night at the end of her ""Breaking the Set"" program. Moscow was not her lone target -- she also expressed disappointment over coverage and ""disinformation"" emanating ""from all sides of the media spectrum"" -- but it was clearly the most noticeable. Apparently, her bosses took notice. The Telegraph reported -- and Martin herself acknowledged -- that the network told her to go to Crimea, the peninsula on the Black Sea where Russian troops reportedly played a part in besieging Ukrainian military bases in the days after that country's Russian-leaning president was ousted. ""But I am not going to Crimea despite the statement RT has made,"" Martin tweeted. Martin is still working for the network, even taking the air again Tuesday night. As RT noted in a statement, Martin called it ""kind of a sad commentary that"" -- while she's regularly spoken out against military intervention -- ""my only criticism of Russia's actions was picked up"" by the media. The network said that Martin ""has not been reprimanded"" for voicing her opinion, something it said that all ""RT journalists and hosts are free to express."" The whole saga has offered an interesting glimpse into the volatile situation in Ukraine, Russian state media and RT, in particular. The Ukrainian crisis has been brewing since last November, when protesters were angry about then-President Viktor Yanukovych's move away from a European Union trade pact and toward an apparently closer relationship with Moscow. Other issues -- including how much control a president should have and his government's treatment of dissenters -- also came into play. Finally, after a few days of violent confrontations between demonstrators and security forces, Yanukovych fled to Russia, and a new pro-Western government took over. That's when Russia reportedly stepped in. Yuriy Sergeyev, Ukraine's U.N. ambassador, claimed Russia used planes, boats and helicopters to flood the peninsula with 16,000 troops. And Ukrainian officials say disguised Russian troops have laid siege to military installations around the Crimean peninsula. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday denied sending any more of his country's troops into the country, or that any of the up to 25,000 troops who are stationed there have played any part in the standoff, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Many don't believe him, including various Western officials and NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. And, apparently, Martin -- who touts her art on her website and has surmised the U.S. government was complicit in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- is among them. In her end-of-show commentary, Martin said she wanted ""to say something from my heart about the ongoing political crisis in Ukraine and Russia's military occupation of Crimea."" ""I can't stress enough how strongly I am against any state intervention in a sovereign nation's affairs. What Russia did is wrong. ""I admittedly don't know as much as I should about Ukraine's history or the cultural dynamics of the region,"" she added. ""But what I do know is that military intervention is never the answer. And I will not sit here and apologize (for) and defend military aggression."" Martin -- a native Californian and San Diego State University graduate, according to the citizen journalism initiative Media Roots she founded -- prefaced her remarks by saying that, ""just because I work here for RT doesn't mean I don't have editorial independence."" That claim may have been belied by the network reportedly ordering Martin to go to Crimea to ""better her knowledge,"" according to the Telegraph report. RT did retweet multiple messages about Martin's rant from Glenn Greenwald -- the former Guardian reporter known most recently for his work revealing the U.S. National Security Agency's spy policies through former government contractor Edward Snowden, who has since been granted asylum in Russia. Among them: ""Who was the @AbbyMartin of @RT in the US television media for Iraq? Do we have one for today's wars?"" And video of her statement was still up on RT's website -- alongside stories about the swelling ""self-defense forces"" in Crimea and Putin saying Russia reserves the ""right"" to use military force -- well after she gave it. That includes her last words: ""Above all, my heart goes out to the Ukrainian people who are now wedged as pawns in the middle of a global power chess game. They are the real losers here. ""All we can do know is hope for a peaceful outcome to a terrible situation and prevent another full-blown Cold War between multiple superpowers. Until then, I'll keep telling the truth as I see it.""","NEW: RT didn't reprimand Martin; she says it's ""sad"" media only reported on this critique .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy supports calls by people in Syria for President Bashar al-Assad to be tried for war crimes, he told CNN on Sunday in an exclusive interview. ""The Syrian people through their revolution and through the movement will -- when the bloodshed stops -- move to a new stage where they will have an independent parliament and a government of their choosing,"" Morsy, Egypt's first freely elected leader, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in Cairo. ""And then they will decide what they want to do to those who committed crimes against them. It is the Syrian people who decide."" Al-Assad's effort to crush anti-government protests in 2011 has turned into a bloody civil war in which the United Nations estimates that more than 60,000 people have been killed. In his first televised address since June, al-Assad said Sunday that Syria was under ""an external attack"" by ""extremists, who only know the language of killing and criminality."" Asked about Syria, Morsy repeated his previous calls for al-Assad to leave power. Egyptian revolutionaries toppled longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak in early 2011, and Morsy has said Egypt will work for Arab and international support to replace al-Assad. Asked whether he thought the Syrian leader should be tried before the International Criminal Court for war crimes, Morsy said, ""It is not I who want this, but the Syrian people who want this."" ""This phase is the phase of the people,"" Morsy said. ""Similar to what the Egyptian people wanted, the Syrian people want it. And we support the Syrian people, and they're going to win, and they have the will to win."" Exclusive photos: Blitzer in Cairo for Morsy interview . Morsy brokered the November cease-fire that ended an eight-day conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist faction Hamas, which controls Gaza. Now, he has invited the heads of the two major Palestinian factions to meet in Cairo in hopes of building unity, a task he acknowledged won't be easy. Morsy said he invited Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to meet with Khaled Meshaal, the political leader of Hamas, who lives in Cairo. Hamas controls Gaza, while Abbas's party, Fatah, controls the West Bank. The two factions have clashed violently over the years. The United States, Israel and the European Union list Hamas as a terrorist organization. The group has carried out numerous attacks, killing scores of civilians. In the interview Sunday with CNN, Morsy sought to assure viewers around the world, as well as people in his own country, that he is committed to promoting democracy and protecting minorities, including the country's Coptic Christians, from discrimination. Having spent time in the United States -- he received a doctorate at the University of Southern California -- Morsy knows U.S. democracy and said he is committed to allowing free speech.","Syrian people ""have the will to win,"" Morsy tells CNN in an exclusive interview .

"(CNN) -- Like every political animal, I will be paying close attention to U.S. Senate elections this Tuesday because they will tell us a lot about the next two years. But I will also have a special eye on a few particular races that may tell us more about our long-term future. Whether we can lift our national politics out of the ditch increasingly depends on whether we can transform our political culture, electing more candidates who want to restore old-fashioned standards of civility, bipartisan respect and putting country first. Sadly, the generation of politicians now in power -- baby boomers for the most part -- are so divided by ideology and a poisonous partisanship that they have lost their way. And the vast majority of Americans are turned off. A CNN poll this past week found that over 60% of Americans are now angry about politics; other surveys show that 9 out of 10 Americans think we have a crisis in leadership. A Harvard Institute of Politics survey out this week finds that young people -- once the optimists in a pessimistic country -- are now as distrustful of our national leadership as everyone else. Perhaps in elections this year and in 2016, leaders will emerge from the baby boom generation who can get us back on track. I sure hope so. But given the track record so far, we also have to start looking and nurturing a new wave of leaders who will bring fresh perspectives and fresh idealism to politics. That's why I will be watching two races in Massachusetts and Georgia so closely Tuesday night. In each, there are candidates who could be on the cutting edge of a new politics. In both cases, they come out of the national service movement -- rising leaders who are promoting an ethic of voluntary service by every young person. One candidate comes out of military service, the other out of civic service here at home. In both we see qualities sorely missing in our national debates -- humility and a deep sense of nonpartisan duty. Full disclosure: I have known and been a mentor to one of them, Seth Moulton, for nearly 15 years; I am actively supporting him now. For Seth, the call to service came from the U.S. Marine Corps, where he signed up as an infantry officer -- ""it's a good way to give back,"" he told me, ""and very good leadership training."" As America went to war in the Middle East, off he went with his troops on the first wave into Iraq (an invasion he disagreed with). Then a second and third tours, all in danger zones. Thankfully, he came home safely and was preparing to pursue concurrent degrees at the Harvard Business School and Kennedy School. His days in uniform seemed over. But Gen. David Petraeus was then named commander of all forces in Iraq and appealed to him to put his uniform back on: he wanted Seth for the surge. Off he went to a fourth tour -- not in the safety of the Green Zone but south of Baghdad amid more danger. Moulton did eventually come home and earned those two additional Harvard degrees. Investment banks tried to recruit him after business school; he went instead to a start-up in Texas trying to build high-speed rail between Dallas and Houston. Then calls started up from Democrats, asking him to run for Congress back home on the North Shore of Massachusetts against an incumbent Democrat dogged by controversies. He took up the challenge and against all odds -- he started with virtually no name recognition and no money -- he won a huge upset victory this September. No one had unseated a Democratic incumbent in Massachusetts for more than 20 years. He is now locked in what may be a very close race this Tuesday -- Republicans have poured in buckets full of money in closing days. But out of the blue, the Boston Globe broke a story that has everyone buzzing: the Globe had repeatedly demanded copies of his military record from his campaign to see if he had been lying about his service, as so many other candidates have. Finally, the paper forced the campaign to fork over the records: lo and behold it turned out Moulton had downplayed his record, never telling voters he had won two military medals for heroism. He hadn't even told his parents! Marines don't like to brag, he said. Is that the hint of a new chapter opening in American politics? One can only wish. Meanwhile, another worthy candidate from the national service movement has come from behind and is now in a thriller in Georgia, facing a strong Republican in a red state. Michelle Nunn is widely known in Georgia as the daughter of the venerable former senator, Sam Nunn. That has certainly helped her. But to those who have worked in the trenches trying to extend a helping hand to the millions who need it, Michelle Nunn has earned a reputation as one of the best non-profit leaders in the country. She started a community volunteerism organization called Hands On Atlanta, grew it until it became the national Hands On Network and then merged with an organization created by President George H.W. Bush, becoming CEO of the new Points of Light Foundation. For those in the national service movement, Michelle's election would be a huge breakthrough: social entrepreneurs -- so crucial to bringing energy and innovation to solve pressing social issues -- would finally have a champion from within their ranks in the halls of national power. In these two cases, the candidates who represent a new wave of leaders happen to be Democrats. Fortunately, there are also stirrings among very promising Republicans as well. Keep your eye out for Eric Greitens, for example: he is the rising star who studied philosophy in college, became an amateur boxer, won a Rhodes scholarship, worked with war refugees in Bosnia and Rowanda, served tours overseas as a Navy SEAL and built a deeply impactful organization for wounded veterans, The Mission Continues (Disclosure: I am on his board). Republicans are urging him to run for statewide office in his native Missouri -- and I hope he does. To their credit, there are some individuals and political organizations stepping up to identify and support other candidates who promise to bring a new, more bipartisan spirit to politics. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has selected a formidable list of moderates he is supporting in this cycle through large TV ad buys totaling tens of millions of dollars. Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig and Republican strategist Mark McKinnon have crowd-raised over $10 million to support candidates open to reforming campaign finance laws. And several smaller organizations are helping to encourage civilian and military service alumni to run for office. So far, of course, the number of new generation candidates elected to office remains small. Yet, we can already see their good works in a couple of states: Louisiana and Colorado. In both, alumni of Teach for America -- Kira Orange Jones and Mike Johnston, respectively -- ran as education reformers within the states and have delivered impressive results. The takeaway is this: Our politics are broken and they have been for years. No matter which party wins the Senate this Tuesday, the next few years could be as stagnant as the last. Even as we put pressure on Washington to change -- and change soon -- wisdom says we must also persuade and inspire a new generation of servant leaders to step forward. Fortunately, they are out there in growing numbers among social entrepreneurs, veterans and others, eager to change the country. This coming Tuesday voters can sign up two of the best for national duty.","David Gergen: American politics needs new perspectives and a new generation of leaders .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- French lawmakers Tuesday recommended a partial ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women. The ban on the ""voile integrale"" -- which literally means ""total veil"" -- would apply in public places like hospitals and schools, and on public transport, a French parliamentary commission announced. It would also apply to anyone who attempts to receive public services, but it would not apply to people wearing the burqa on the street, the commission said. The commission stopped short of recommending a full ban because not all of the 32 commission members could agree on it. They will now recommend that Parliament pass a resolution on the partial ban. Such a resolution, if passed, would not make the wearing of a full veil or burqa illegal, but it would give public officials support when asking people to remove it. Commission members began their work six months ago after French President Nicolas Sarkozy controversially told lawmakers that the full veil was ""not welcome"" in France. Sarkozy said the issue is one of a woman's freedom and dignity, and did not have to do with religion. The French National Assembly assembled a cross-party panel of 32 lawmakers to study whether women in France should be allowed to wear the burqa -- or any other full veil, including the niqab, which shows only the eyes. The commission also studied whether such full veils pose a threat to France's constitutionally mandated secularism. Commission members heard from 200 people from all areas of French society, including Muslims, though they only heard from one woman who wears a veil. By recommending a ban on full veils in public places such as hospitals and schools and by anyone receiving public services, the commission members said they wanted to assist those working with members of the public when asking that full veils be removed. That would include school teachers who meet children's parents or ticket agents at train stations. A date for the vote in Parliament has not been set, though it is unlikely to happen before regional elections which are scheduled for March 14 and 21. Parliamentary majority leader Jean-Francois Cope said this week he believed the resolution will pass. Any law directed at full veils is likely to be challenged in the courts both in France and at the European level. More than half of French people support a full ban, according to a recent opinion poll. The Ipsos poll for Le Point magazine found 57 percent of French people said it should be illegal to appear in public wearing clothes that cover the face. That's despite government estimates that less than 2,000 women in the country actually wear the full Islamic veil. France has about 3.5 million Muslims, representing about six percent of the population, according to research by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. The country does not collect its own statistics on religion in accordance with laws enshrining France's status as a secular state. French lawmakers believe the burqa is a growing phenomenon beneath which lies a not-so-subtle message of fundamentalism. Those who advocate the ban say women are often forced to wear full veils by the men around them -- husbands, fathers or brothers -- and that it is a sign of subjugation. However, women who actually wear the veils deny that. ""You are going to isolate these women and then you can't say that it is Islam that has denied them freedom, but that the law has,"" said Mabrouka Boujnah, a language teacher of Tunisian origin. Boujnah, who at 28 is about to have her first child, says she came to wearing a full veil gradually, after wearing headscarves as an teenager. She said she believes a law against full veils would take away fundamental rights of Muslim women. She and her friend Oumkheyr, who would not give her last name, say they prefer to cover their faces out of piety. The women, both French citizens, say they are only following their religious beliefs and France should respect that. But even some Muslims in France think the full veil goes too far. There is nothing in the Quran that directs women to cover their faces, said Imam Hassen Chalghoumi, who runs the Islamic center in Drancy, a Paris suburb. He said it is ridiculous to do so in France. France already has a law against Muslim girls wearing headscarves in state schools. It sparked widespread Muslim protests when the French Parliament passed the law in 2004, even though the law also bans other conspicuous religious symbols including Sikh turbans, large Christian crucifixes and Jewish skull caps. In 2008, France's top court denied a Moroccan woman's naturalization request on the grounds that she wore a burqa. France is not the only European Union country to consider banning the burqa. Dutch lawmakers voted in favor of a ban in 2005, although the government at the time left office before legislation could be passed. --CNN's Jim Bittermann in Paris contributed to this report.","French lawmakers propose ban on burqa in some public places including hospitals and schools .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- How's this for a bright idea? Police in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen are responding to headlight infractions with an eye-for-an-eye punishment. If you're caught using your brights in the city, which shares a border with Hong Kong, police will sit you down in the full glare, not of an interrogation room lamp, but of their own full-beams. A post on the Shenzhen traffic police's Weibo account spells it out. ""Do you dare to use full-beam headlights anymore?"" the post asks. ""From now on, 'uncle cop' will have you stare at the lights for five minutes if they catch you abusing them."" The stern warning is offset by an animated laughing emoticon. There is also the addition of a more traditional fine of 300 yuan ($49). Mixed response .

"Washington (CNN) -- The House of Representatives passed a slightly altered health care ""fixes"" bill Thursday night, completing legislative action on President Obama's top domestic priority. The so-called ""fixes"" bill, approved by a 220-207 vote, now goes to Obama to be signed into law. It makes changes in the broader health care reform measure that Obama enacted Tuesday. Approval by both the House and Senate on Thursday concluded a tortuous legislative struggle for the health care reform legislation, which received no Republican support in any of the major votes in either chamber dating back to last year. How will health reform affect you? ""This is a very proud night in the history of this Congress,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters, adding he expected Obama to sign the measure next week. Thursday's vote ""completes the process of a bill that has been in the making literally for a century, and certainly for decades,"" said Hoyer, D-Maryland. The ""fixes"" bill also included provisions to shift government funding for student loans away from commercial banks to new education initiatives. Until now, commercial banks have received federal subsidies for student loans. Earlier Thursday, Senate Republicans forced two minor provisions involving the student loan funding to be stripped from the bill -- changes that required the House to take up the bill a second time but had no effect on the broader health care bill that took effect Tuesday. A Senate Republican Budget Committee memo said the violations raised by GOP senators involved Pell grant spending that won't immediately affect the federal budget, and therefore was ineligible for inclusion in the measure. That's because the measure was being passed under reconciliation rules, which apply only to budget-related measures. After the changes, the Senate approved the bill on a 56-43 vote to send it to the House a second time. On Sunday, the House passed both the overall health care bill and the accompanying fixes bill as part of a complicated legislative process necessary to overcome unanimous Republican opposition. Republicans used every parliamentary tool available to try to undermine both the overall health care  bill and the fixes measure. They forced the Senate to begin deliberations on a series of proposed amendments starting Wednesday night. The Senate did not adjourn until 2:45 a.m. Thursday. The Senate reconvened at 9:45 a.m. to consider additional GOP proposals which, among other things, were designed to force Democrats to cast unpopular votes in the run-up to November's midterm elections. The Democrats' fixes bill was necessary to get a reluctant House to pass the Senate's health care reform measure unchanged. If there had been any changes to that initial bill, it would have had to go back to the Senate for another vote, which almost certainly would have failed. Since a special election earlier this year in which Democrats lost the Senate seat formerly held by Sen. Ted Kennedy, the party has not had enough votes to overcome a Republican filibuster. That situation prompted the two-bill strategy Democrats are using. After passing the Senate bill without changes, House Democrats passed the fixes bill Sunday to alter provisions they did not like. Because the bill was being handled under the reconciliation rules in the Senate, only 51 votes were needed for passage. The compromise package added more than $60 billion to the overall plan's cost partly by expanding insurance subsidies for middle- and lower-income families. Specific provisions included: . • Closing the Medicare prescription drug ""doughnut hole"" by 2020. Under current law, Medicare stops covering drug costs after a plan and beneficiary have spent more than $2,830 on prescription drugs. It starts paying again after an individual's out-of-pocket expenses exceed $4,550. Senior citizens stuck in the doughnut hole this year will receive a $250 rebate. • Raising the threshold for imposing the so-called ""Cadillac"" tax on expensive health insurance plans to coverage valued at more than $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. The tax won't kick in until 2018. • Imposing an additional 3.8 percent Medicare payroll tax on investment income for individuals making more than $200,000 a year and couples making more than $250,000 a year. • Eliminating a special exemption for the state of Nebraska from all new Medicaid expenses -- known as the ""Cornhusker Kickback."" The federal government will instead assist every state by picking up 100 percent of the costs of expanded Medicaid coverage between 2014 and 2016, and 90 percent starting in 2020. • Reducing the fine for individuals who do not purchase coverage from $750 to $695. • Increasing the fine on large companies failing to provide health coverage for workers from $750 to $2,000 per employee. The compromise package would add more than $60 billion to the overall plan's cost partly by expanding insurance subsidies for middle- and lower-income families. It also would expand Medicare's prescription drug benefit while scaling back the bill's taxes on expensive insurance plans. Among the GOP amendments to the fixes bill defeated by Democrats were a provision to eliminate new penalties being imposed on businesses whose workers use federally subsidized insurance. In addition, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, proposed that drugs for erectile dysfunction, such as Viagra and Cialis, be prohibited to sex offenders, and Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, sought to strike so-called ""sweetheart deals,"" such as an extra $300 million in Medicaid funds for Louisiana. Republicans are ""not serious about helping this bill,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Wednesday. They are concerned only with ""throwing roadblocks in front of anything we do."" Republicans raised points of order against the fixes bill on two provisions, and the Senate parliamentarian ruled them legitimate. Democrats lacked the 60 votes necessary to override the ruling. CNN's Ted Barrett, Tom Cohen, Alan Silverleib, Lisa Desjardins and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: House passes Senate health care ""fixes"" bill by 220-207 vote .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Around 1.2 million children are believed to be involved in prostitution in India, the country's federal police said Monday. Ashwani Kumar, who heads the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), told a seminar on human trafficking, that India occupied a ""unique position"" as what he called a source, transit nation and destination of this trade. India's home secretary Madhukar Gupta remarked that at least 100 million people were involved in human trafficking in India. ""The number of trafficked persons is difficult to determine due to the secrecy and clandestine nature of the crime. ""However, studies and surveys sponsored by the ministry of women and child development estimate that there are about three million prostitutes in the country, of which an estimated 40 percent are children,"" a CBI statement said. Prostitution in pilgrim towns, exploitation through sex tourism and pedophilia are some of the ""alarming trends"" that have emerged in recent years in India, it noted. Authorities believe 90 percent of human trafficking in India is ""intra-country.""","Around 1.2 million children are believed to be involved in prostitution in India .
