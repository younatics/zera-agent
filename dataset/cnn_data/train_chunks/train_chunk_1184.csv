"Swollen limbs, a sore throat, headaches, heavy legs, dehydration, dizziness and exploding ear drums. The symptoms  of flying are enough to make you want to stay at home. Your body is a finely tuned temple and low oxygen levels,  humidity and sudden changes of pressure can wreak havoc with it. Luckily there are a few things you can do to combat the worst effects of flying. Here's how to take matters into your own hands… . Scroll down for video . Fly smart: Learn how long and short haul flights can affect the body so you can take precautions . Under pressure . Most planes fly at 35,000 feet where the air is thinner and smoother, but less hospitable for us. At that elevation air pressure is far lower than it is at ground level. As a result, cabins are pressurised to resemble an altitude of roughly 7,000 feet, that's 11 pounds per square inch. Still, it's the same effect on your body as if you were sitting on top of a mountain for hours at a time and can cause oxygen levels to dive. That can be a problem for passengers with conditions such as heart or lung disease who should fly with an oxygen concentrator, or not at all. But even the healthiest among us can feel the ill effects of less oxygen after a couple of hours on board. Lower blood oxygen levels (decreasing to 93 per cent at cruising altitude) cause fatigue and brain fog as well as headaches and dizziness. Above the clouds: Planes fly at 35,000 ft where the air is thinner and smoother . What can you do? 1.) If you are worried about the effects of low oxygen levels in blood because of a pre-existing condition consult your GP before flying. 2.) Put down the gin and tonic. Alcohol exacerbates symptoms as it interferes with your cells' metabolism making them less efficient at absorbing oxygen. It can also cause you to dehydrate faster (more on that below). 3.) Give up smoking. Smoking can deplete oxygen levels by up to eight per cent before you've even boarded the flight. Give yourself and your lungs a fighting chance  by ditching tobacco well in advance of your flight. 4.) Travel on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner which has higher air pressure and humidity levels than other jetliners, a lower cabin altitude of 6,000 ft and fewer pollutants. Many airlines now use the aircraft, check SeatGuru before booking to see if your flight does. John Greenlee, flight planning director at Houston-based Continental Airlines says, 'On flights of eight, 10 or more hours, we think people will arrive feeling fresher.' Cabins are pressurised to feel like 7,000 ft, which is like sitting on top of a high mountain for hours on end . Passenger friendly: Boeing 787 Dreamliner has higher oxygen levels, low humidity and fewer pollutants . Sitting ducks . We all know that sitting for extended periods in painfully upright, narrow chairs is uncomfortable, but it can also be dangerous, especially for older passengers who suffer poor circulation. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) warns: 'Being seated for a long time, such as on flights longer than about four hours, may increase the risk of developing blood clots in the veins in your legs (also known as deep vein thrombosis or DVT).' It also doesn't help blood oxygen levels as blood pools in your legs and feet, preventing efficient circulation of oxygenated blood around the body and brain causing more dizziness and even fainting. What can you do? 1.) The CAA recommends walking up and down the aisles and doing small exercises (airlines often provide exercise information in their in-flight magazines or entertainment systems) to boost blood flow. 2.) Compression stockings help prevent blood collecting in the lower limbs and uncomfortable swelling. 3.) The Aviation Health Institute recommends taking low-dose aspirin (100 – 150 mg) the day before flying, during the flight and for three days after to improve blood flow by thinning the blood and making it less likely to clot. 4.) Wear loose fitting clothing in breathable fabrics which won't constrict veins or blood flow and keep you from over heating. Talk a walk: CAA recommends getting up and stretching your legs, taking aspirin and compression stockings . Ready for landing . Pressure inside the cabin fluctuates as the plane lands. To the average passenger that will feel equivalent to descending at  roughly 350 feet a minute, as you drop from the pressurised cabin level of 7,000 feet to zero in about twenty minutes. As a result your ears pop and can hurt like hell. The reason? Eustachian tubes inside the ear are opening and closing, trying to balance and match the changing pressure inside your ear with that outside your head. If you have a cold the effects will be more painful as these tubes won't be able to open or close as easily and the eardrum will bulge inwards. Worst case scenario, your eardrum could rupture. What can you do? 1.) Chew, yawn, suck sweets or swallow to open the Eustachian tubes. 2.) Failing that, try the Valsalva manoeuvre, named after Antonio Maria Valsalva, a seventeenth century physician who obsessed over ears and pioneered the technique. Hold your nose, keep your mouth shut and forcefully exhale. 3.) Make sure you are awake during landing ready to do both points above. 4.) Take a prescription decongestant or antihistamine on the day of and before flying. 5.) Buy air pressure-regulating ear plugs which slow the rate of air pressure on the ear drum. Ear-nough! Swift changes in pressure during landing makes ears pop and can  burst ear drums . Eustachian tubes inside the ear open and close to regulate the pressure inside the ear with the outside . Dryness . The air you breathe in an airplane is sucked in from the outside. It flows through the engine, then gets compressed, cooled, filtered, and pumped into the cabin. At high altitudes, that can make the plane environment drier than a desert as it contains 66 per cent less water than at sea level. The Association of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends humidity at between 30 and 64 per cent for humans to be comfortable. In an aircraft, it can drop to two per cent. On short flights this amounts to dry mouth and nose and on longer flights can mean headaches, dizziness, susceptibility to infection and dehydration. Parched: The altitude that jetliners fly can make the pressurised air system feel dryer than a desert . What can you do? 1.) Fly on crowded flights. It sounds horrible but moisture from other passengers' breathing and perspiration can increase the relative humidity dramatically, according to the CAA. 'In the instance of an eight-hour flight in a CD-10 with 265 passengers, the humidity level can rise to 20 percent; the same flight with only 108 passengers sees this level fall to 2 per cent,' they say. 2.) Budget flights don't have free water on tap. Buy a bottle once you've gone through security and take it on board with you instead. Wellness manager and nutritionist at Grace Belgravia, Katie Greenall, says,'It is tough to get the balance right, you want to remain hydrated but don't want to drink so much that you are constantly queuing for the loo. A good indication of adequate hydration is having smooth, hydrated lips. I would advise between one and two cups of water per hour.' The more the merrier: moisture from other passengers' breathing and perspiration can increase humidity . 3.) Avoid alcohol or caffeinated drinks which can act as diuretics making you dehydrate faster. 4.) Contact lens wearers: Keep a bottle of solution (under 100ml, of course) in your hand luggage and remove lenses early to avoid discomfort later on as they shrivel against your eyeball. Use the solution to rejuvenate tired eyes and lenses throughout the flight.","Cabins are pressurised to  7,000ft and feel like sitting on top of a mountain .

"Germans are well-known for their love of beer and Chancellor Angela Merkel is no exception. The German leader has been snapped with a bearded Brisbane local outside the craft beer house Brewski Bar, on Caxton Street in Brisbane, ahead of the G20 on Saturday. When she arrived back at her hotel, on the same street, the Chancellor crossed the road to mingle with locals and German speakers. Scroll down for video . A smiling Chancellor Angela Merkel enjoyed a craft beer at the Brewski Bar on Caxton Street . Matt, the owner of Brewski Bar, said when Chancellor Merkel arrived it was like a ‘rockstar’ had turned up. ‘Everyone was screaming and cheering,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. The bar was given no warning that she was coming but the staff had been ‘double guessing who was staying at the hotel’ across the road. ‘The motorcade turned up, they closed the street off and a nice shiny Merc or something rocked up with the German flags on the front. She jumped out of the car and came straight in,’ Matt said. ‘I was standing outside the bar and she shook my hand I said “welcome to Australia” and she said “thank you very much”.’ Matt said despite having 120 types of beer in his bar ‘not one is German’. Chancellor Merkel met with locals outside the five-star Gambaro Hotel in Brisbane . Dr Merkel arrived in Brisbane for the meeting of world leaders after a stop over in New Zealand where she also showed her fun side and cooed over a cute kiwi bird at Motutapu Island. The kiwi name Whau was held by a Department of Conservation ranger as Chancellor Merkel patted her.

"Gruesome: Radio presenter Sneha Kothari Mashru (above) survived the Kenya mall shootings by covering herself in a boy's blood to fool gunmen into thinking she was dead . A radio presenter today told how she survived the Kenyan mall massacre by smothering herself in the blood of a teenage victim to look like she was dead. Sneha Kothari Mashru said the boy died of his injuries while they cowered from gunmen who stormed the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi. She first switched his phone off to stop it ringing in case it alerted the attackers then came up with a gruesome plan to play dead. She told Sky News: 'I took a lot of his blood, (as) much (as) I could and I tried to put it on myself. 'I put it on my arm, a lot of the teenager's blood, and while I was trying to put it on my hand I just realised that he had stopped breathing at that time. 'So I put it on my arm, as much as I could, and I covered my face with my hair, because my hair was let loose even then, just to pretend that I'm dead or probably badly injured,' She said she would like to find out his identity. Her story emerged as the search continued for bodies in the rubble left by four days of fierce fighting between Kenya forces and Al Shabaab militia. The current death toll is 72 and is likely to climb with uncounted bodies remaining in the wreckage of the mall. Another 175 people were injured, including more than 60 who remain in hospital. At least 18 foreigners were among those killed. Meanwhile, the government figure for the number of Britons killed in the Nairobi shopping mall attack has been reduced from six to five. The Foreign Office said one of the victims previously thought to have been a UK national was Kenyan. Scroll down for video . Chasm: New footage has revealed the extent of the destruction to Nairobi's Westgate mall after three floors of the complex collapsed during heavy fighting between Kenyan forces and Islamic militants . Carnage: The collapse came on Monday, shortly after large explosions rang out followed by billows of smoke . However, a spokeswoman warned that the casualty figure could still rise further as the authorities continue to comb the scene. 'We can now confirm that on present information five British nationals have been killed in the recent terror attacks in Nairobi,' she said. 'One individual previously thought to be British is a Kenyan national. Our thoughts are with his family and with the friends and family of all of those who have died during this difficult time. 'We have no information at this time that any further British nationals have been killed, although we cannot rule out the potential for further British casualties and we continue to stay in close contact with the Kenyan authorities as their investigations continue.'

"How AFC Wimbledon applied the Common touch to regroup, rebuild and earn a re-run of the 1988 FA Cup Final against Liverpool . ‘The Crazy Gang have beaten the Culture Club.’ Commentator John Motson’s immortal line captured the spirit of the most memorable FA Cup final shock of modern times. That 1988 final at Wembley in which Wimbledon, a non-League club just 11 years before, beat mighty Liverpool 1-0 to deny them the Double has gone down in history. Twenty-seven years on and with League Two AFC Wimbledon, founded after the original Wimbledon moved to Milton Keynes, about to stage a ‘rematch’ with Liverpool in the third round on Sunday, JOE BERNSTEIN gets the full story of that incredible day in the words of those who were involved: .

Bobby Gould felt it was a bit quiet at dinner so he gave us some money and we nipped round to a pub for a few beers.’ Alan Cork (Wimbledon): ‘We had a good drink. We were in the bar until they chucked us out at 11.45pm and didn’t get much sleep.’ Wimbledon captain Dave Beasant (left) shakes hands with his Liverpool counterpart Alan Hansen (right) Cup final morning, May 14, 1988 . Thorn: ‘It was nervy on the coach driving in. We were watching TV showing the Liverpool players being interviewed on their coach. Then Alan Hansen started talking about how it would be a nice day out for us and it would be “Spot the Wimbledon fan”. It started livening up then! He gave us an extra little bit of fire.’ Terry Gibson (Wimbledon): ‘People thought we’d change our behaviour in front of millions of people on TV but that was never going to happen.’ John Fashanu (Wimbledon): ‘I was very reluctant to shake hands, even with Digger [Johnny Barnes] one of my friends. I was snarling at him.’ John Barnes (Liverpool): ‘All that talk of intimidation is rubbish. There are pictures of us laughing and joking in the tunnel. We had players who had won European Cups, do you think they’d be intimidated?’ Bobby Gould (Wimbledon manager): ‘I travelled to Wembley in a blue and grey check cup final suit. But I am superstitious so I changed into my lucky Marks & Spencer jacket, tie, trousers, underpants and socks before I led the team out the tunnel.’ Liverpool winger John Barnes insists his side were not intimidated by Wimbledon before the game . The Game . 9 minutes: Vinnie Jones leaves Steve McMahon in a heap by the halfway line. Vinnie Jones (Wimbledon): That tackle was planned weeks before. As he’d turn, I knew he would open himself wide up. I was waiting and the first time he did it, bang. It was a real “we don’t give a s***” moment. I smashed him.’ John Aldridge (Liverpool): ‘In the modern game, it would have been the quickest red ever. He absolutely went through Stevie.’ 35mins: Peter Beardsley escapes a shirt-tug by Thorn to score, but the goal is ruled out because referee Brian Hill has blown for the foul.

Sanchez claims that the special haircut he had for the final helped him score his glancing header . John Fashanu (centre) revealed he had to celebrate with his 'arch enemy' Sanchez . Sanchez: ‘It was a glancing header. I’d had a special haircut for the day and it worked. It was probably the worst goal celebration ever though because Dennis Wise jumped on me and blocked the camera from showing my face.’ Fashanu: ‘Sanch was my arch enemy at the club and I had to hug the b******!’ 61mins: Clive Goodyear is penalised for a challenge on John Aldridge but Wimbledon captain Dave Beasant becomes the first goalkeeper in FA Cup final history to save a penalty, from Aldridge. Aldridge: ‘I couldn’t believe the ref had given it but I knew it was a great chance for us to equalise. I’d scored 10 out of 10 penalties that season so I was confident.’ Beasant: ‘I knew if John didn’t do his shuffle, he tended to put the ball to the keeper’s left, so I stood up and dived that way.’ Thorn: ‘I fancied Lurch [Beasant’s nickname] to save it. He’d practised diving to his left in training, though we p***ed him off by shooting to his right to muck him about!’ John Aldridge is fouled by Wimbledon's Clive Goodyear (right) to concede a penalty . Dave Beasant guesses correctly by diving to his left to save John Aldridge's penalty . Aldridge: ‘It’s s***e to miss a penalty in a cup final. Absolute s***e. I just wanted the ground to swallow me up. I just wished I’d put it a different height, either higher or lower.’ 90mins: The final whistle. Little Wimbledon have won the FA Cup. Thorn: ‘I jumped on Bessie’s back at the final whistle, punching the air. I’d been at Wimbledon since I was nine, the only one in the team who had come right through the youth system. I’d even been a ball boy at Plough Lane.’ Fashanu: ‘Bobby Gould has to take a lot of the credit. Dave Bassett had done well to get us in the First Division but I don’t think we would have won the FA Cup under him.’ Wimbledon manager Bobby Gould (front) celebrates on the Wembley pitch with his players . Wimbledon players went from Wembley to celebrate at a party staged by owner Sam Hamman . The Celebrations . Thorn: ‘We had the longest lap of honour ever seen, nobody wanted to come off the pitch. Bobby was telling us to calm down but Vinnie was throwing the cup in the air. ‘We went back to Wimbledon for the night. [Owner] Sam Hammam put up a marquee at Plough Lane and it was the best party I’d ever been to. All the players down to the apprentices had their own table for 10 and I celebrated with friends and family until silly o’clock. I posed for a picture with my nan Margaret with the FA Cup. Not bad for a kid from a council estate in south London. Happy times. ‘The only disappointment was that we weren’t allowed to play in Europe because we’d have done all right [English clubs had been banned following the Heysel disaster]. The team split up, but if we’d been in Europe, we would have all stayed. Fashanu: ‘I’ve been speaking to Vinnie, Wisey and all the boys this week.

"Motorists are facing the threat of fuel shortages and £100 fill-ups after one of Britain’s biggest refineries went bust yesterday. As well as posing a serious risk to forecourt supplies, retailers say it could see petrol prices soaring to record highs as speculators and profiteers capitalise on the disruption. Diesel prices in particular are set to rise by up to 3p to a record £1.45 a litre, they warn. That would mean more than £100 to fill up a typical family saloon with a 70-litre tank. MPs and unions joined the chorus warning of shortages while forecourt bosses said there was a risk of parts of the South East ‘grinding to a halt’ after supplies from the giant Coryton refinery in Essex were suspended. Crisis looms: MPs and forecourt bosses warned parts of the South East could 'grind to a halt' amid reports production had stopped at the giant Coryton refinery in Essex, pictured . Motoring misery: Petrol retailers have warned that the crisis could cause snaking queues and chaos on the forecourts as pumps run dry . No petrol, diesel or other products, including bitumen for road building, were leaving the site yesterday. The action came when the refinery’s owner ran out of cash and was unable to extend its credit facilities. Administrator PricewaterhouseCoopers said it had no idea when supplies would resume but was ‘talking to customers’. Coryton supplies around 10 per cent of the UK’s petrol and diesel, and 20 per cent of the total in the South East. The warnings came as Coryton’s Swiss-parent company Petroplus filed for bankruptcy with the threat to up to 1,000 UK jobs at the former BP-owned refinery. A separate strike by more than 80 tanker drivers at the South Killingholme refinery in Lincolnshire, which supplies around 340 Jet filling stations, is exacerbating supply concerns. But energy ministers and oil industry bosses said they were doing their best to make up the shortfall from the UK’s seven remaining refineries and by buying in from abroad. A sudden rush to the pumps, however, could trigger filling stations running dry. PwC said refining was continuing at . Coryton but supplies were being stored rather than being sent out. It . could not say when normal service would resume. Steven Pearson, joint administrator and PwC partner, said: ‘Our immediate priority is to continue to operate the Coryton refinery and the Teesside oil storage business without disruption while the financial position is clarified and restructuring options are explored.’ Warning: East of England Euro MEP Richard Howitt said he didn't want to be alarmist but said that the suspension could impact the Olympics . The Government insisted it was doing all it could to find a buyer. Profiteers and speculators in the energy markets are already poised to capitalise on the problems to push up wholesale prices which will mean hefty increases at the pumps, say petrol retailers. Even before the latest crisis, the AA had warned that motorists were on course for a 2p a litre fuel price hike at the pumps – adding £1.40 to the fill-up for a Ford Mondeo. The Coryton crisis could see that rise even higher, say retailers. Record pump prices set on May 9, 2011 were 137.43p a litre for petrol and 143.04p for diesel – or just over £100 to fill up a new Ford Mondeo with a 70-litre tank. If diesel hits £1.45 a litre it will cost  £101.50 per fill-up. Yesterday diesel averaged 142.21p a litre in the UK – less than 1p off the record – and means it currently costs £99.50 to fill up a Mondeo. Petrol, at 133.89p yesterday, is 3.54p a litre off the May record. Forecourts fear a repeat of the crisis which caused chaos in Scotland in 2008 when the giant Grangemouth refinery was hit by strike action – leading to pumps running dry, ‘sold out’ signs, and some cases of petrol rationing north of the border. RAC Motoring Strategist Adrian Tink said: ‘The message for motorists in the area is a simple one – don’t panic buy and potentially  create a problem.’ East of England Euro MEP Richard Howitt said: ‘I don’t want to be alarmist about this, but I don’t want to be dishonest either. Supplies across London and the South East could be affected and I have been told this could impact the Olympics.’ Panic stations: The refinery supplies 20 per cent of the petrol used in London and the South-East as well as other areas around the UK . Coryton has refining capacity for ten . million tonnes of crude oil per year. Some 36 per cent of its output is . petrol and 27 per cent diesel, the rest a mixture of other fuels. Fears . petrol supplies could run out grew as tanker drivers went on strike at . the South Killingholme refinery in Immingham, Lincolnshire. South . Killingholme supplies around 340 Jet filling stations, of which the . majority are in the North and Midlands, but 66 are in the South East. The . drivers are employed by delivery firm Wincanton and members of the . giant Unite union. A union spokesman at the Conoco-Phillips-Jet Ocran . Terminal at Immingham said: 'No tankers have passed through the picket . line and six or seven have turned back.' The . strike involves 123 tanker drivers at three ConocoPhillips sites in . total: Immingham; the Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire and a site . in Stockton-on-Tees in the North East. RMI . Petrol’s Brian Madderson said: 'We are faced with a double whammy. The . Killingholme strike started at 5am when more than 80 drivers walked out . and joined the picket line.' He said shortages would push up the price of fuel as traders and speculators exploit the situation for profit. But if the administrators shut down the refinery at Coryton 'then we’re into a totally different ball game.' There . are seven other refineries in the UK – at South Killingholme and . Lindsey, both in North Lincolnshire; Fawley, near Southampton; . Grangemouth, near Falkirk; Stanlow in Cheshire; and Milford Haven and . Pembroke, both in Pembrokeshire. Petroplus previously owned a refinery . in Teesside, which closed in 2009. Adding to supply woes is a strike by tanker drivers at the South Killingholme refinery which supplies around 340 Jet filling stations, of which the majority are in the North  and Midlands. Instability in Iran and its threat to block key oil tanker routes in the Straits of Hormuz, coupled with the strong dollar, is also storing up trouble, retailers warned. The UK has 8,500 filling stations of which 2,132 are in the South East. Of these, about 600 are BP and Texaco sites supplied from Coryton. Petroplus reported a net loss of £265million in the first nine months of last year, while in December its banks withdrew a £675million portion of its £1.29billion credit facility. The other main supplier for the South East and London is the Exxon Mobil refinery in Fawley. A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said it was helping to look for buyers but that the ‘immediate priority’ was to keep the Coryton refinery and Teesside storage business operating’. He added: ‘In the short term, companies have made alternative arrangements to ensure adequate supplies of products are available in the South East.’ Petroplus had been increasingly relying on its British offshoot for funds. At the end of 2009, it owed the British arm £42million. But by the end of 2010 the Swiss company’s borrowings from its British subsidiary had ballooned to £114million. The company’s fate was sealed when 13 banks, including Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas, froze a $1billion loan that was keeping it going. Global accountancy giant PwC has been appointed administrator for the British companies.","Petroplus, owner of Coryton refinery in Essex, files for bankruptcy .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has admitted becoming a more 'autocratic' manager because of the club's Champions League campaign. Rodgers and Liverpool face a make-or-break encounter with Basle on Tuesday, which echoes their famous 2004/05 win against Olympiakos which took the club through to the knockout stages and on the road to later glory in Istanbul. The congested fixture list caused by Liverpool's European games has prevented Rodgers from properly bedding in his nine new summer signings and forced him to change approach after a 3-1 defeat against Crystal Palace on November 22 left the club in 12th place. VIDEO Scroll down to see Rodgers post-match comments following  Sunderland draw . Brendan Rodgers says he has had to be more 'autotratic' this season as Liverpool manager . Rodgers chases down the ball during Liverpool's 0-0 draw at home to Sunderland on Saturday . Real Madrid are winners and Liverpool must beat Basel to take second spot. For the following match in Ludogorets, which Liverpool drew 2-2 to set up the showdown with Basle, Rodgers returned to basics by leaving out new signings Emre Can, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Lazar Markovic, and says he's been far more direct with instructions to his players. 'I have had a lot less time on the training field this year. The problem I have had personally is you can’t try things, you can’t coach,' said Rodgers. 'That is alright if I'd had two years working with the same group and only added a couple of new players. But I've had nine new players and no coaching time. 'When I first came to Liverpool, I put my principles in place; this is the way I work. 'Once I was bedded in and people understood, I became a little more democratic, more educational. But after Palace, I’m thinking “Right, I need to become autocratic again.” 'I've provided even more clarity, been more concise in the ways of working. 'Ultimately, it’s about winning and after Crystal Palace I needed to look because we were nowhere near our level our standard. So I had to find the solution to win games.' Liverpool new boys Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Albert Moreno were left on the bench against Ludogorets . Captain Steven Gerrard (left) started on the bench against Sunderland to rest him for the game against Basel . Liverpool have lost three of their five Champions League group games so far – two of them to holders Real Madrid – but will progress into the last-16 if they beat Basle by a scoreline that will give them a better head-to-head record than the Swiss side, won their first game 1-0. The situation is strikingly similar to the Olympiakos game which took place exactly 10 years ago on Monday and has gone down in Anfield folklore. Liverpool needed to score three goals to progress after Brazilian legend Rivaldo had given the Greek side a half-time lead.

Five months later, Liverpool were winning the trophy itself for the fifth time after an incredible comeback against AC Milan and Rodgers hopes the remarkable season can be an omen. 'It is a tough competition. But as we have seen over the years, it is not always the best team that can go on and do well in it,' said Rodgers. 'Our only concentration is to get out of the group. If we can do that, we will be better later on. 'We know what happened against Olympiakos. They went on and won it that year, having just about qualified.

"A 17-year-old girl has killed herself after four boys raped her and spread a photograph of the assault, causing classmates and friends to taunt and cyber-bully her, her mother has said. Rehtaeh Parsons from Nova Scotia, Canada hanged herself in her family's bathroom on Thursday after months of torment and, on Sunday night, her parents took her off life support. Questions are now emerging over whether authorities and her friends did enough to help Rehtaeh, who relatives said quickly slipped from an A-student to a moody, unpredictable teenager. No charges were ever brought against Rehtaeh's alleged attackers following the assault in 2011; an investigation was launched but authorities concluded they did not have enough evidence. Tragic: Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, has killed herself after allegedly being gang-raped and then bullied . On a Facebook tribute page, her . mother, Leah Parsons, described how her daughter was forever changed by . the alleged assault in their hometown of Cole Harbour. 'She went with a friend to another's home,' her mother wrote. 'In that home, she was raped by four young boys. One of those boys took a photo of her being raped and decided it would be fun to distribute the photo to everyone in Rehtaeh's school and community, where it quickly went viral.' The alleged attack left then 15-year-old Rehtaeh an outcast at Cole Harbour District High School, where her rapists were also students. Friends, students and strangers taunted her, her mother said. 'People texted her all the time, . saying ""Will you have sex with me?""' she said. 'Girls texting, . saying ""You're such a slut"". 'She was never left alone. She had to leave the community. Her friends turned against her. People harassed her... It just never stopped,' her mother told CBC. Struggle: After she was allegedly raped, her attackers spread a photo of the assault around her school . Her parents moved from Cole Harbour to Halifax to help her escape the bullies and Rehtaeh made new friends and began hearing from her old school friends, who offered her their support. She said her daughter also started therapy, which appeared to be helping. Yet she would become angry quickly, and last week's suicide attempt was probably the result of a mood swing, Leah said. 'She acted on an impulse, but I truly, in my heart of heart, do not feel she meant to kill herself,' her mother wrote on Facebook. 'By the time I broke into the bathroom, it was too late.' The Canadian police launched an investigation, which took a year, but concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring up charges. 'An investigation into an earlier sexual . assault was completed, and in consultation with the Crown, there was . insufficient evidence to lay charges,' RCMP spokesman Cpl. Scott MacRae said. Sadness: Leah Parsons, Rehtaeh's mother, pictured, said she believes the police investigation was flawed . Family: The family even moved to escape the bullies, but she still struggled with mood swings . 'They didn't even interview the boys until much, much later,' To me, I’d think you’d get the boys right away, separate them.” Relatives said they saw the photograph but could not determine who had taken it, so were unable to charge the teenagers - even though the picture legally constituted child pornography. 'The whole case was full of things . like that,' Leah said. We didn’t have a rape kit done because we didn't even know until several days later when she had a . breakdown in my kitchen. She was trying to keep it to herself.' RCMP spokesman Cpl. Scott MacRae . confirmed to the Chronicle Herald that the authorities are currently investigating a . sudden death involving a young person, but would not provide further details. Bullied: Rehtaeh eventually left the high school when even her friends turned on her, her mother said . Loss: Her family said they do not believe she wanted to die but that it was a spur of the moment decision . Her mother said she wants other people to learn from the tragedy and how social media allowed her to be continually violated following the brutal rape. Rehtaeh shared her sadness on Facebook, including a post on March 3 which read: 'In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.' Barrett Khan, a vice-principal at Cole Harbour District High School, told The Globe he couldn’t comment on the case as the teenager had left more than a year ago. 'Our thoughts are with the family during this difficult time,' a spokesman for the Halifax Regional School Board said in a statement. 'We are not going to respond directly to the family’s comments as we do not want to add to their grief.'","Rehtaeh Parsons 'was raped by four classmates when she was 15'

"He was more than happy to discuss his collection of African art on the air. But when it came to the allegations of sexual assault leveled against him, Bill Cosby went silent. At the end of an interview with NPR on Saturday morning, the 77-year-old comedian was asked to respond to the resurgence of claims that he attacked multiple women years ago. Sitting beside Cosby and his wife Camille, host Scott Simon said: 'This question gives me no pleasure Mr Cosby, but there have been serious allegations raised about you in recent days. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Silence: At the end of an interview with NPR on Saturday morning, Bill Cosby (pictured) was asked to respond to the resurgence of claims that he sexually assaulted several women years ago. Instead, he remained silent . Interview: Host Scott Simon, a father of two, later took to Twitter (pictured) to remark on his broaching of the allegations, which seemingly had not been agreed to as a potential topic of conversation prior to the interview . 'I'm in the news business. I have to ask the question. Do you have any response to those charges?' While seconds earlier Cosby had been confidently chatting about the loan of his art for an exhibition in Washington D.C, he immediately stopped speaking. Instead, he reportedly shook his head and refused to say another word. Undeterred, Simon prodded: 'There are people who love you who might like to hear from you about this. I want to give you the chance.' But despite his efforts, Cosby stayed quiet. SCOTT SIMON: 'This question gives me no pleasure Mr Cosby, but there have been serious allegations raised about you in recent days.' BILL COSBY: [silence and shaking his head] . SIMON: 'You're shaking your head no. I'm in the news business. I have to ask the question. Do you have any response to those charges?' COSBY: [silence and shaking his head] . SIMON: 'Shaking your head no. There are people who love you who might like to hear from you about this. I want to give you the chance.' COSBY: [silence] . SIMON: 'Alright. Camille and Bill Cosby. They have lent 62 pieces from their collection of African and African American art to create an exhibit called Conversations: African and African American Artworks in Dialogue. It's now on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art through early 2016. Thank you both.' Cancelled: The  interview comes just a day after Cosby's scheduled appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman next week was cancelled. Above, Cosby's last appearance on the show  - January 13, 2014 . Finally, the 62-year-old presenter concluded: 'Alright. Camille and Bill Cosby. They have lent 62 pieces from their collection of African and African American art to create an exhibit. 'Conversations: African and African American Artworks in Dialogue is now on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art through early 2016. Thank you both.' Although Cosby remained silent, his wife could be heard saying 'Thank you' twice. Simon, a father of two, later took to Twitter to remark on his broaching of the allegations, which seemingly had not been agreed to as a potential topic of conversation prior to the interview. Telling her story: Earlier this month, one of Cosby's alleged victims, Barbara Bowman (pictured, left and right), came forward and shared her story with MailOnline , claiming she was sexually assaulted by the star at 19 . He tweeted: 'I'll respond to @BillCosby questions later. For moment: Yes, I hated having to ask about charges in front of Mrs Cosby.' The Weekend Edition Saturday interview, later uploaded to CNN, comes just a day after Cosby's scheduled appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman next week was cancelled. The cancellation meant the comedian has been dropped from a TV lineup twice in a month following his withdrawl from Queen Latifah's talk show in early November. Decades-old accusations of rape came back to haunt Cosby last month after stand-up comedian and former Saturday Night Live writer Hannibal Buress unleashed a violent tirade about him. During a live performance, Buress dubbed Cosby a 'rapist' and a sanctimonious hypocrite. A video of the rant quickly spread online, reigniting a fire that has long burned. It also inspired one alleged victim, Barbara Bowman, to come forward and share her story with MailOnline, claiming she was sexually assaulted by Cosby when she was aged 19. On Friday, a spokesman for The Late Show confirmed to Newsday that Cosby's guest booking for next Wednesday had been cancelled. It unclear whether it was Cosby or Letterman  that pulled out. Meanwhile, a representative for Queen Latifah's talk show reported that it was Cosby who withdrew from his spot on October 31. Allegations of rape were first leveled against Cosby in 2005 in a lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee. Under fire: Decades-old rape claims came back to haunt Cosby (pictured giving a Veterans' Day speech in Philadelphia on Tuesday) last month after  comedian Hannibal Buress unleashed a violent tirade about him . Clams: During a live performance, Buress dubbed Cosby (pictured) a 'rapist' and a sanctimonious hypocrite . The 32-year-old claimed she had been sexually assaulted in the star's Philadelphia mansion in 2004, adding that her suit also contained the testimonies of 13 other women with similar claims. The suit was settled in 2006 for an undisclosed amount. Bowman has now come forward identifying herself as one of those 13 women. Speaking to MailOnline, Bowman alleged: 'I was drugged and raped by that man. He is a monster. He came at me like a monster. 'My hope is that others who have experienced sexual abuse will not be intimidated into silence by the famous, rich and powerful. If I can help one victim, then I've done my job.' Backfire: On Monday, Cosby invited fans to create memes using a selection of photos of him. However, the idea majorly backfired - his Twitter feed was inundated with memes that referenced the rape claims (pictured) Bowman was just a teenager at the time she met Cosby, and soon the actor was flying her to meet him around the country and putting her up in the nicest hotels, it is alleged. Things changed, however, when one night she reportedly passed out after a glass of wine and woke up vomiting in the toilet wearing Cosby's white t-shirt. Bowman is certain that she was drugged by Cosby. And she believes she was raped by him too. After that her relationship with Cosby changed, and by 19 he had sent her on her way after a final night in Atlantic City, where she claims he tried to rape her. Cosby has not commented on the allegations and has never been charged with sexual assault. He has been married to Camille for 50 years and has five children. On Monday,  in an apparent attempt to connect with his Twitter followers, Cosby invited fans to create memes using a selection of photos of him. However, the idea majorly backfired. Instead, the comedian's Twitter feed was inundated with memes that referenced the rape claims. Shortly after, Cosby's original tweet was deleted and the meme generator was removed from the site.

"Subway says it's in the process of removing a chemical from its bread as part of an ongoing effort to improve its recipes. The announcement comes after a popular food blogger launched a petition this week asking the sandwich chain to stop using the ingredient, called azodicarbonamide. A representative for Subway says the change was underway before the petition was launched, but did not immediately provide details on when it started or when it would be complete. 'The complete conversion to have this product out of the bread will be done soon,' Subway said in a statement, without providing further details. Scroll down for video . That yoga mat looks good enough to eat!: Subway removes 'bleaching' chemical from its bread . Vani Hari, who runs FoodBabe.com, has targeted other food companies including Kraft and Chick-fil-A for the chemicals in their products. In the latest petition targeting Subway, Hari noted that the azodicarbonamide used in its bread 'as a bleaching agent' is also used to make yoga mats and shoe rubber. The petition noted that Subway doesn't use the ingredient in its breads in Europe, Australia or other parts of the world. Although the ingredient is used in other food products, Hari said she focused on Subway because of the healthy image it tries to project. Subway has endorsement deals with Olympic athletes. 'This is not eating fresh!' Hari's petition said. On Tuesday, Subway's Facebook page was filled with comments regarding the chemical. As Americans pay closer attention to what they eat, food companies have worked to market their products as natural. But companies have also come under growing pressure to remove chemicals people find questionable. That pressure has been heightened by consumers' ability to voice and share their concerns online. Last year, for instance, PepsiCo said it would remove an ingredient that had been linked to a flame retardant from its Gatorade drinks. PepsiCo also said its decision was not a response to an online petition that had called for it to remove the ingredient.

"He is barely old enough to go to infant school, let alone fight in a savage civil war. Yet this youngster, believed to be just four years old, is one of the latest ‘cub jihadists’ recruited for bloody battle in Syria. He can be seen firing rounds from an automatic assault rifle in a shocking video that has emerged from the war-torn country. Scroll down for video . Assault rifle: Alarming footage appears to show a child, believed to be four years old, shooting an AK-47 as the reliance on children on the Syrian bloodbath continues. The footage was posted online by a jihadist group . Children of war: The boy will have lived almost his whole life through the Syrian conflict, though with his high voice and chubby cheeks, he belongs more in infants' school than on a battlefield . Counter-terrorism officials say it is further evidence of how jihadists are grooming children to become fighters, as  Al Qaeda factions strive to establish a Taliban-like Islamic state in Syria. The disturbing footage was posted on YouTube and is believed to be that of a son of a jihadist from Albania who is one of thousands of foreigners fighting with Al Qaeda in Syria. The youngster, who wears a black ski mask, can be seen firing shots from a black AK-47-style automatic assault rifle with a folding stock. He is so small that the barrel of the gun has to be supported by a section of road block so that he can cope with its weight. The child opens fire to shouts of Allahu Akbar – Arabic for ‘God is Greater’ – before an arm reaches down and retrieves the weapon. Warfare: The footage comes amid warnings that up to 700 young British extremists are fighting in Syria . War games: The video shows the child smiling and talking in his native language with the adults filming him . Week-long peace talks collapsed last night amid a stand-off between rebels and the Syrian government. The delegation of President Bashar Assad (right) refused to commit to return to UN negotiations in 10 days, as the opposition accused them of posturing and prolonging the bloodbath. More than 130,000 people have been killed in Syria since March 2011 and activists claim 1,900 died during the peace talks alone. Opposition chief Ahmad al-Jarba said Assad was pressed by his Russian backers to take part in the talks but could not engage toward finding a real solution because 'he knows that would be his end.' He added: 'For us, [Assad's] family is finished from the memory of the Syrians, all that is left is blood, fire and terrorism. We will not accept for this man or anyone from his family to rule the country again.' Earlier, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said: 'We are here to find a political solution. We were unable to achieve that.' UN mediator Lakhdar Brahimi said progress was 'very slow indeed'. He added: 'Nevertheless, during our discussions, I observed a little bit of common ground - perhaps more than the two sides realise or recognise.' The video emerged as French President . Francois Hollande yesterday claimed as many as 700 Britons are among . extremists fighting in the Syrian civil war. Speaking . at a press conference after talks with David Cameron, the president . said: ‘We have young people who live in our respective countries who are . being manipulated, and they are going off to the combat areas. ‘Today we were exchanging figures – 600 to 700 young people are involved in each of our countries.’ That is almost double the most recent estimate by experts and comes amid ‘huge concern’ from security chiefs that the young jihadists will target Britain when they return from fighting in Syria. The video of the four-year-old first emerged on January 21 on a YouTube channel operated by a jihadist who claimed to be based in northern Syria. It was entitled in Arabic: ‘A message from one of the cubs of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.’ The footage was removed after it was exposed by an American-based ‘anti-jihad’ activist who claimed it was evidence of child abuse. Copies of the video, however, remained in circulation on other online channels. Suspected British Al Qaeda fighters in Syria have been circulating other images showing children being trained to use deadly weapons in a jihad training camp. The pictures showed children aged between nine and 15 in full battle dress and wearing black ski masks bearing the distinctive logo of Al Qaeda. Many were seen holding Kalashnikov automatic assault rifles, tripod-mounted heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. The video of the toddler emerged just days after the European Union’s anti-terror coordinator warned that social media websites play a crucial role in recruiting foreign fighters to travel to Syria. Shocking: More photos show children as young as nine at a training camp toting guns and wearing ski masks . Top counter-terrorism officer Sir Peter Fahy said British fighters arriving from Syria posed a threat to the UK . Gilles de Kerchove told the Home Affairs Select Committee that online messages, many posted by ‘narcissistic youths posing with AK-47 rifles, had contributed to an acceleration in the number of Europeans, including Britons, travelling to Syria to fight – with many falling in with extremist groups. The issue – which has become a key focus for the security and intelligence services – was among topics discussed by Mr Hollande and Mr Cameron. Syria is proving a popular training ground for would-be jihadists. Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police – who leads the Association of Chief Police Officer’s ‘Prevent’ strategy on counter-terrorism – told the BBC this week there was ‘huge concern’ that Britons arriving back after fighting in Syria posed a threat to the UK. Scotland Yard has also said its biggest concern is that some could return as terrorists. In the past month, 16 people have been arrested on suspicion of terror offences after travelling between Syria and the UK. This compares with 24 in the whole of 2013.

"The Border collie has been named man's best friend in a new study that rates the attributes of each breed. At the other end of the scale, the bulldog was rated as the most overrated pooch, in the study by journalist David McCandless. The research, which was done for his website, Information is beautiful, ranked each breed on cost, intelligence, health, lifespan, and ease of grooming. Mr McCandless said he hoped people did not take the data, which he has displayed in an infographic called Best in Show, personally. The infographic, called Best in Show, created by journalist David McCandless to illustrate his new study that names the Border collie a man's bestfriend . 'I mean I love bulldogs - I love any dog,' he told The Times. The Border collie ranked highly because of its intelligence, obedience, and average lifespan of 12 years. Developed in the Scottish border region for herding livestock experts say they have unlimited energy and stamina. It wasn't all good news for the collie. The same study also placed it 29th in a list of family friendly breeds. The border collie was named the top dog in the research, while the bulldog was said to be the most overrated breed . Bulldogs, who only have an eight year lifespan, fell down in the data because of their lack of intelligence, price, and poor health.

"The Duchess of Cambridge has expressed her grief over the death of a 12-year-old cancer patient she met on a visit to the Royal Marsden Hospital. Catherine spent time with leukemia sufferer Fabian Bate, then aged nine, when she and William attended the opening of a new children's wing at the Surrey hospital in 2011. Shortly after the visit, the Duchess, 32, penned a hand-signed letter to the young boy that spoke movingly of how she had been touched by his 'strength of character' and 'positive energy'. Scroll down for video . Touched: The Duchess of Cambridge with Fabian Bate, then aged nine, at the Royal Marsden Hospital in 2011. Catherine spent time with the boy when she and William attended the opening of a new children's wing . Moving: Shortly after meeting Fabian, the Duchess penned a hand-singed letter to the leukemia patient. In it, she spoke of how she had been touched by his 'strength of character' and 'positive energy' Source of strength: Prince William with Fabian, his parents Darrell and Lydia, and sisters Cassia (left) and Oleander during the 2011 visit. Fabian often recalled that William had told him to 'be brave' when they met . Today his parents, Darrell and Lydia, have revealed how their son, who died at home in Hampton Court, Greater London, on Tuesday, drew strength from her words in the years since their meeting. Mr Bate, 52, told the Daily Mirror: 'Just having the memory that the future King and Queen are rooting for you is pretty awesome to have in your armoury and for keeping your child going in the dark times.' In her note, written on St James’s Palace headed notepaper, Kate said: 'This must be a troubling time for you, your parents and your sisters, but I know I left the Royal Marsden assured by how incredibly talented, kind and clever the team at the hospital are. 'Combined with your belief and positive energy, you couldn’t be in better hands.' After being diagnosed in 2006 and undergoing three years of chemotherapy, Fabian went into remission in 2009. But the cancer returned in July 2011 and he had to undergo transplants with bone marrow donated by his sister, Cassia. Prince William and Kate made the visit to the Surrey hospital in October 2011, just six months after their wedding. Tribute: Mr Bate, pictured with Fabian, wife Lydia and daughters Cassia (left) and Oleander, said today that his son has been laid to rest with the 'very personal and special' letter he received from the Duchess . The Duke of Cambridge took over as president of the Royal Marsden following his mother’s death in 1997. In her letter, Kate expressed delight at the news that Fabian’s two older sisters Cassia, now 14, and Oleander, now 20, had been found to be a bone marrow match. The Duchess added: 'I will keep my fingers crossed that your health goes from strength to strength over the months ahead.' Speaking six months after he received the letter, Fabian recalled that it was 'kind' of the Duchess to send him the letter, but said that it made his Mum 'cry a bit'. Inspiring: Fabian, pictured right in 2012, died at home in Hampton Court surrounded by his parents, brother and two sisters, Cassia (left) and Oleander (right), on Tuesday after an eight-year battle with leukemia . Sorrow: A spokesman for the royal couple said: 'The Duke and Duchess are sad to hear the news and their thoughts are with Fabian's family'. Above, Catherine with Fabian during the 2011 hospital visit . After the first letter, the royal couple sent two more letters to Fabian to let him and his family know that they were updated on his progress and treatment and that he was in their thoughts. A spokesman for the royal couple said yesterday: 'The Duke and Duchess are sad to hear the news and their thoughts are with Fabian's family.' Mr Bate said today that his son, who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2006, has been laid to rest with the 'very personal and special' letter. 'I want Kate to know that it wasn't just a letter, it was a message that meant so much. It has stayed with him and it is staying with him now that he is departed.' He added that his son would often remember that William, 32, had told him to be brave during the visit. Speaking a year after the visit, Fabian, then 10, recalled with excitement the day he met the royal couple. He told the Daily Mail: My sisters came to hospital that day because they were excited to see Kate and William. It was funny when William put his arm around Ollie: it made her blush. 'I asked Kate about the wedding — girls like talking about those things — and told her it made everyone very happy. 'She promised to look at my blog Faith4Fabian and one day when we were getting ready to go to Legoland the postman knocked with a letter from her. 'She wrote that it was nice to meet me and she was keeping her fingers crossed. It was kind, but it made Mum cry a bit. Fabian, born in 2002, was first diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in June 2006 after his parents noticed that he had developed a small lump on his neck. Due to his initial poor response to the treatment, Fabian was categorised as being 'at high risk of relapse' - which means that he only carried a 60 per cent chance of being cured. But the three years on treatment went better than expected and, apart from minor infections and a case of shingles, he coped very well having few hospital admissions. He remained in remission and in September 2009 he came off treatment. Posting on Fabian's blog, Faith4Fabian, his parents said they 'enjoyed a wonderful period without daily medication'. By July 2011 he had become 'noticeable more lethargic and anaemic' - both typical symptoms of recurring disease - and suspicions were aroused during one of his frequent trips to hospital. A blood test confirmed that he had relapsed but revealed that it was isolated to the bone marrow. As the relapse was 36 months from his initial diagnosis, he was put in the immediate risk category. That year Fabian met the Duke and Duchess when the royal couple, who had married just five months previously, attended the opening of a new children's wing at the Royal Marsden Hospital. Later that year it was confirmed that his sisters, Cassia, then 11, and Oleander, then 17, were perfect bone marrow matches for their brother. Due to a medical complication, Oleander could not donate her stem cells as planned and Cassia had to step in and take her place - with the transplant procedure taking place in 2012. Over the course of his treatment, Fabian had several rounds of gruelling chemotherapy and two bone marrow transplants as well as trying new therapies. He had been due to visit Sheffield to start a biological therapy last month but could not travel because of fever.

"A family won't have trouble remembering their children's birthdays - because all four siblings were born on the same day. Emily Scrugham and Peter Dunn were amazed when their newborn son arrived on January 12, the exact same date as his three elder brother and sisters. New baby Ryan shares his birthday with his five-year-old brother Sam, and his two-year-old twin sisters Brooke and Nicole. Emily Scrugham and Peter Dunn, from Cleator Moor, Cumbria, were amazed when their newborn son arrived on January 12, the exact same date as his three elder brother and sisters . The couple from Cleator Moor, Cumbria, beat odds of a staggering 1/133225 in producing a quadruple birthday for their four children. Emily, 22, said: 'I really can't believe we have another birthday on the same day - it certainly wasn't planned. 'None of the births were due on January 12. Sam was two weeks late, the twins one month early and Ryan three days late. 'The twins had to be delivered by emergency caesarean section as doctors couldn't find their heartbeats. I didn't want them to be born on his birthday but I didn't have a choice. 'And this time round, I went into labour 9pm on Saturday night [January 11] and Ryan appeared at 3am, meaning we now have an extra special little family.' The couple who have been together for seven years and met through mutual friends, say having four children all born on the same day is just a lucky coincidence. Peter, 24, said: 'I'm still trying to work out if it would be easier to have birthdays spread throughout the year or all on the same day. New baby Ryan shares his birthday with his five-year-old brother Sam, and his two-year-old twin sisters Brooke and Nicole . 'It doesn't matter though - we plan to make every birthday a real family event where birthdays get celebrated individually and together.' This year, Sam had his own cake and Brooke and Nicole shared one while waiting for mum to come out of hospital. Emily said she would never dream of moving their birthdays so they could have their own day to celebrate. She said: 'They were all born on January 12 so it will be celebrated on that day.' Further down the line, the couple will have to plan a 21st, an 18th and a 16th birthday party all for the same day. Peter said: 'It will always be tough just after Christmas but we will shop for bits and bobs all year round to try and take some of the strain.' The family said they are looking forward to the normal challenges and sleepless nights of having four children aged five and under.","Emily Scrugham and Peter Dunn, from Cumbria, call it a lucky coincidence .

"Gordon Ramsay says the opening night of hist new restaurant was sabotaged by a rival making 100 fake bookings, but did not name the suspect . Gordon Ramsay may have a reputation for being one of the most brutal head chefs in the restaurant business, but it seems his rivals are capable of being equally devious. Mr Ramsay claims that a competitor sabotaged the opening night of his new restaurant by secretly booking 100 out of 140 tables, leaving the eatery almost empty. The television chef said staff at Heddon Street Kitchen, in London's Mayfair, were left upset and deflated, and will now have to reconfirm every booking to ensure they are not caught out again. He refused to name the rival he believes was involved, but said it showed the 'level of envy' on the restaurant scene while speaking on the Jonathan Ross show, to be broadcast on ITV tonight. Ramsay's new eatery is described as having a 'relaxed' atmosphere and 'modern European' menu which is ideal for 'brisk brunches and post-shopping pit stops through to lunch, dinners and after work cocktails.' The kitchen is run by head chef Maria Tampakis who grew up New York and worked for three-Michelin starred chef Jean Georges at Cook before moving to London. She worked briefly for Heston Blumenthal at his Knightsbridge restaurant Dinner, moved to Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen, near St Paul's Cathedral, as head sous chef before being moved to the head of Heddon Street Kitchen. The new opening marks Ramsay's 12th restaurant in the capital, and brings his total number of eateries up to 24 worldwide - sharing seven Michelin stars between them. Speaking about the new restaurant, The Telegraph quoted Ramsay as saying: 'I think there's all that level of envy. Saturday was our first big day, we had 140 on the books and 100 no show. Scroll down for video . Speaking on the Jonathan Ross show, to be broadcast tonight, Ramsay said the incident shows the 'bad spirit' and 'level of envy' involved in the professional restaurant business . Ramsay also spoke on the show about his swearing, saying he never uses fould words in front of his children, calling it 'industry language' which he only uses when he has 'a reason' 'It's bad spirit and you see the staff and they are down and frustrated, I was there to pick them up and make sure we stay focused.' While Ramsay may have built a highly-acclaimed restaurant empire, he is perhaps most famous for his foul-mouthed rants on shows such as Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and Hell's Kitchen. However, he doesn't swear at home or in front of his children, he told Jonathan Ross, describing the expletives as 'industry language' which he only uses when he has 'a reason' to do so. Ramsay's new Mayfair restaurant, his 12th in London, was opened last Saturday but was left nearly empty after 100 of the 140 booking failed to turn up .

"From the use of 'coercion and threats' to 'emotional abuse', this shocking 'checklist' for dating women was posted on Twitter by California 'pick-up artist' Julien Blanc. The diagram, featuring three sections entitled 'physical', 'violence' and 'sexual', was originally designed by a domestic abuse charity to help women identify when they are being abused. However, the 25-year-old uploaded it to his Twitter page earlier this week, alongside the caption: 'May as well be a checklist… #HowToMakeHerStay.' The post, which has now been hidden online, came as British politicians urged the country's Home Secretary Teresa May to ban Mr Blanc from coming to the UK. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Self-described 'pick-up artist' Julien Blanc, from California, posted this chart - designed to help women identify when they are being abused - on his Twitter page, calling it a 'checklist' for 'making her stay' Guru: Mr Blanc (pictured in a Twitter photo) runs $3,000-a-head 'dating seminars' for men across the world . Mr Blanc is due to be in Britain on November 21 to host a seminar on pick up techniques, but an online petition calling for him to be denied entry has already attracted 120,000 signatures. The 'dating guru' has made a name for himself by being what he describes as an 'executive coach' for the company, Real Social Dynamics, a so-called 'international leader in dating advice'. Men from across the world pay as much as $3,000 each to attend seminars where he and his associates purport to teach how to seduce women. But last week, Mr Blanc was forced to cut a visit to Australia short due to widespread protests at his advice, which includes choking women, threatening to commit suicide and injuring their pets. 'It's unspeakable,' Mike Burke, a 32-year-old British researcher based in Tokyo, who is a leading force in the 'Take Down Julien Blanc' Facebook campaign, told Fox News. 'He's inspiring people to commit an act that is criminal. And the misogyny is shocking.' Under fire: The 25-year-old's techniques' for picking up women includes choking them (pictured), injuring their pets, threatening to commit suicide, and isolating them from their friends . Criticism: The businessman had to cut his recent trip to Australia short following widespread demonstrations . Mr Burke, whose Facebook group taking on Mr Blanc has more than 9,000 followers, added that the 'pick-up artist's' seminars cross the line of free speech by inciting the audience to commit assaults. Through his company's work, Mr Blanc promises customers the chance to 'witness dating coaches attract beautiful women in live demonstrations'. But videos and pictures of the businessman in action suggest he encourages men to harass women with the aim of having sex with them. A video of one of his seminar in Japan shows him saying that 'white men... can do what you want' in Tokyo, suggesting that men grab women's heads and thrust them towards their crotch. Campaign: Mike Burke, a 32-year-old British researcher based in Tokyo,  is a leading force in the 'Take Down Julien Blanc' Facebook campaign (pictured), which has so far gained more than 9,000 'likes' Speaking of Mr Blanc's planned trip to Britain, UK crime minister, Lynne Featherstone, said she was 'extremely concerned' by his 'sexist and utterly abhorrent' comments about women. The Liberal Democrat politician added: 'If he was allowed to perform in the UK I have no doubt that cases of sexual harassment and intimidation would increase. 'Free speech is obviously hugely important, but with free speech comes responsibility. It is not appropriate to talk about choking girls under any circumstances.' Sarah Green, from the UK-based End Violence Against Women Coalition, agreed: 'His so-called pick up coaching promotes behavior amounting to sexual harassment and sexual assault. Taking action: British politicians, including crime minister Lynne Featherstone (pictured), have called on the country's Home Secretary Teresa May to block Mr Blanc from being allowed to enter the UK . 'More broadly, he is part of a culture which trivializes abuse of women and racism. At worst this tells victims of abuse that what has happened to them doesn't matter, and gives potential abusers the nod that such behavior will not be taken seriously.' A UK Home Office spokesman said: 'All visa applications are considered on their individual merits in line with the immigration rules. 'The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.'","Julien Blanc posted image on Twitter with caption: '#HowToMakeHerStay'

"A scheduled Bill Cosby appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman next week has been cancelled as rape allegations continue to besiege the beloved comedian. It is the second time in a month that the 77-year-old has been dropped from a TV lineup, after he withdrew from Queen Latifah's talk show. Decades-old accusations of rape came back to haunt Cosby last month after stand-up comedian and former Saturday Night Live writer Hannibal Buress unleashed a violent tirade about Cosby, calling him a 'rapist' and a sanctimonious hypocrite during a live performance. A video of the rant quickly spread online, reigniting a fire that has long burned, and inspiring one woman, Barbara Bowman, to come forward and share her story withThe MailOnline, claiming she was sexually assaulted by Cosby when she was 19. Cancelled: Bill Cosby representative David Brokaw confirmed Friday night the comedian would not appear on The Late Show With David Letterman as previously scheduled next Wednesday. Cosby's last appearance on the show, seen here, was January 13, 2014 . A spokeswoman for The Late Show confirmed to Newsday that Cosby's guest booking for Wednesday had been cancelled. However it is unclear whether it was Cosby or Letterman et al that decided to pull out. Spokespeople for Queen Latifah's talk show reported that it was Cosby who withdrew from his spot on October 31 . Allegations of rape were first levelled against Cosy in 2005 in a lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand, 32, a former Temple University employee . Constand claimed she had been sexually assaulted in Cosby's Philadelphia mansion in 2004. She also said her suit contained the testimonies of 13 other women with similar claims. The suit was settled in 2006 for an undisclosed amount. Bowman has now come forward identifying herself as one of those women. Telling her story: Barbara Bowman told MailOnline how Cosby 'raped and drugged her' while she was just a teenager . Under fire: The 77-year-old Emm - and Grammy-winning actor and comedian, who has been married for 50 years and has five children, has been battling accusations of sex assault for more than three decades. He is seen here giving a Veterans Day speech in Philadelphia on Tuesday . 'I was drugged and raped by that man,' she told The MailOnline. 'He is a monster. He came at me like a monster. My hope is that others who have experienced sexual abuse will not be intimidated into silence by the famous, rich and powerful. 'If I can help one victim, then I've done my job.' Bowman was just a teenager at the time she met Cosby, and soon the actor was flying her to meet him around the country and putting her up in the nicest hotels. Things changed however when one night she passed out after a glass of wine and woke up vomiting in the toilet wearing Cosby's white t-shirt. Bowman is certain that she had been drugged by Cosby. And she believes raped by him too. After that her relationship with Cosby changed, and by 19 he had sent her on her way after a final night in Atlantic City where she claims he tried to rape her. Cosby has not commented on the allegations and has never been charged with sexual assault. He has been married for 50 years and has five children . Decades old rape allegations against Bill Cosby came back to haunt the comedian once again on Monday when a supposedly harmless social media stunt blew up in his face . On Monday, Cosby, in an attempt to connect with his Twitter followers, invited fans to create memes using a selection of photos of him. However the idea majorly backfired. His Twitter feed was inundated with memes that referenced the rape claims. Not long after, Cosby’s original tweet was deleted and the meme generator was removed from the site and the link now redirects people to Cosby’s homepage.","Guest spot on The Late Show scheduled for Wednesday cancelled .

Adviser Eric William Johnson, 51, of Chicago's RedRidge Securities is nowhere to be found as authorities say he made 115 wire transfers from his client's accounts to his own between the years 2004 and 2014 . The firm is a boutique brokerage house which Johnson ran with David Brent Hurt. Prior to joining RedRidge Johnson was registered with multiple firms, two of which were expelled by FINRA's predecessor, the NASD. Hurt said Johnson's dismissal was due to the allegations. 'Sadly, the termination was for cause as we have reason to believe he violated several securities regulations. The violations, though serious, were isolated to five accounts out of the hundreds we manage,' he said. On Wall Street reports that Johnson has been permanently banned from the industry. The SEC has charged Johnson with violations of the Securities Exchange Act and the Investment Advisers Act. His attorney, Thomas Leinenweber, says he cannot speak to his client's guilt or whereabouts. 'We can't commit on the substance of investigations that are ongoing but he is cooperating with authorities to the extent that he can,' Leinenweber said. Johnson reportedly concealed the theft by using computers that were not associated with his name or account. It's not yet certain what became of the cash. The FBI is reportedly investigating criminal charges but agency representatives have declined to comment on the situation, according to Business Insider.

"A Dutch pensioner, 91, has had the words 'do not resuscitate' tattooed across her chest in a right-to-die protest. Nel Bolten, from The Hague in the Netherlands, says she had the ink, which also states she is over 91, because she does not want emergency crews to bring her back to life if she stops breathing. Despite ambulance services previously stating they would not accept the tattoo as valid, Dutch health minister, Edith Schippers, has confirmed it is a legal declaration. Nel Bolten from the Netherlands said she had the tattoo because she does not want to be revived by medics . The 15cm-wide body art will lawfully allow Ms Bolten the right to self determination to end her life - a complex issue in the Netherlands, which has an increasing population of elderly people. A spokesman for the health minister confirmed the legislative change to Dutch Association for Voluntary End of Life (NVVE), according to Dutch media reports. The organisation says on its website that it is 'for everyone who wants to die with dignity'. 'We want the best possible implementation of euthanasia, especially for groups that do not get help in practice, such as people with dementia, chronic psychiatric patients and elderly people who feel that their life is complete,' it says. NVVE currently offers its members what it calls a 'not-resuscitate penning', which is essentially an ID tag stating the person's name, date of birth, a photograph and a signature on a necklace. It is a statement to a first-aider that the patient does not want to have CPR administrated on them, however, there has been issues in that medics have been unable to find them. The 15cm-wide tattoo across her chest, which reads 'Do not resuscitate, I'm 91+', has now been accepted as a legal declaration as a right to die by the Dutch health minister, Edith Schippers . The idea of a tattoo was hoped to be a bolder statement after Ms Bolten said she did not trust the necklaces. She told a Dutch newspaper: 'I've seen on TV that it was a matter of seconds for ambulance staff - they really don't look for a necklace. 'I do not want to end up as a vegetable in a chair.' Ms Bolten had worked with Ms Schippers to try and make the statement tattoos a formal and legal declaration to medics - and she is not the only person to have one. In 2012 an 88-year-old Dutch woman had a similar tattoo done on her left breast to let her last wishes be known. While Peter Hagens, 61, from Muiden in the Netherlands is another person who has braved it and had the ink tattooed on his chest.","Nel Bolten from the Netherlands has had the statement 15cm-wide tattoo .

"U.S. President Barack Obama gave a landmark speech at the G20 Summit on Saturday where his call for immediate action to protect the Great Barrier Reef was met with rousing applause. Conservationists have claimed that the U.S. President's urging should force industrialisation along the Queensland coast to stop immediately. Mr Obama piled pressure on the Abbott government to act on climate change, declaring that natural wonders such as the Great Barrier Reef were under direct threat from climate change. And although Prime Minister Tony Abbott did not mention climate change in his opening address to G20 leaders, it appears the government  may be backing down  on the eve of the main leaders' event. 'It's my understanding ... that they are actively discussing the issue of climate change,' said UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, who expects leaders to make a strong commitment to the problem over the weekend. 'Of course, climate change is the defining issue of our times, therefore it's only natural that G20 leaders should focus much more on this,' he said. President Barack Obama received a rock star's welcome at his landmark speech at the University of Queensland . The U.S. President said today that no country was immune to the effects of climate change and that everyone must play a role in fighting the global phenomena. 'I want my daughters to be able to come back and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit, he told an audience at the University of Queensland to loud applause. 'I want that there 50 years from now.' Despite the official G20 agenda excluding the issue of climate change, President Obama mirrored the concerns raised by protesters outside the venue in South Brisbane, calling for developed nations to join in the 'global fight'. While the Australian government attempted to keep the focus of the Asia-Pacific leaders summit on economic growth and jobs, Mr Obama steered the focus back to climate change, following the U.S. deal with China to slash emissions. The U.S. President also urged younger Australians to put pressure on politicians to take action on the issue and committed $US3 billion to the Green Climate Fund to aid developing nations to assist with initiating economies that were cleaner-fueled. Japan is also expected to unveil a $US1.5 billion contribution to the fund over the G20 summit weekend. Civil society groups are urging Australia to make its own contribution. President Obama's speech to several hundred lucky students was one of the hottest items on the G20 agenda, and he didn't disappoint . US President Barack Obama smiles broadly as he takes the stage to speak at the University of Queensland, telling the audience he heard Queensland was: 'beautiful one day, perfect the next'. The Australian Marine Conservation Society said the US president had put the reef's future front and centre, and the government must stop paying lip service to serious concerns raised by UNESCO, the UN's environmental arm. UNESCO has given Australia until February to show it is properly managing the Barrier Reef, and if the world body is not satisfied with the response, the reef could be listed as a World Heritage site 'in danger'. Felicity Wishart, spokeswoman for the Marine Conservation Society said that it was time for the Federal and Queensland governments to 'take heed and act decisively.' She claimed that the government had attempted to 'placate concerns by whitewashing international consternation such as that expressed by UNESCO and the World Heritage committee.' Ms Wishart said that in order to reverse the trend, 'our governments must stop the rapid industrialisation of the coastline, driven primarily by plans for increased coal mining.' President Obama also issued a stark warning to Russia over the destruction of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 and pleaded for the world to act on climate change. In a speech where he joked about drinking the popular Queensland beer XXXX, dubbed the G20 host city 'Brisvegas' and said he wanted to give Australian humour 'a burl', the second term president told a crowd of young Australians and political bigwigs that the United States, 'as an ally and friend', shares Australia's grief over the destroyed Malaysian Airlines flight. President Obama told the audience that Russian aggression was a 'threat' to the world . President Obama also said that he wanted global action on climate change, so maybe his daughter's had the chance to see the Great Barrier Reef . In a pot shot at Russian President Vladimir Putin's administration, Mr Obama said the United States was 'leading in opposing Russia's aggression, which is a threat to the world - which we saw in the appalling shoot down of MH17'. Thirty-eight Australians were killed in the incident earlier this year, and tensions have ratcheted up between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Russian President Vladimir Putin after the incident, particularly after the prime minister threatened to 'shirtfront' the Russian leader over the issue at this weekend's G20 meeting. In the address, the president also urged the world to seal a global deal on climate change, 'because I have not had time to visit the Great Barrier Reef,' Mr Obama said, to a roar of laughter. 'And I want to come back!' The president, who announced a $3 billion contribution to the Green Climate Fund, continued: 'And I want my daughters to come back and I want their daughters or sons to visit.' The president also acknowledged Australia has had a 'healthy debate' about action to stop climate change but he said that if China and the United States could strike a deal on the global threat - as they did earlier this week: 'We can get this done.' The president, who arrived in Australia this morning and will leave tomorrow evening, bemoaned the fact he never got to see much of the country. 'I've got to sit in conferences and talk to politicians instead of going to the beach,' he said, comments which were met with laughter from the audience, many who had waited for several hours to hear the president's address. The president also acknowledged Australia has had a 'healthy debate' about action to stop climate change but he said that if China and the United States could strike a deal on the global threat - as they did earlier this week: 'We can get this done.' Mr Obama said that his staff 'were very excited to visit Brisvegas' and had recommended he drink the famous Queensland beer, XXXX. 'I learnt to speak a little 'Strayan'. I'm tempted to give it a 'burl',' he quipped, before laughing at his joke. 'That's about as far I'll go.' After the address, Australian political bigwigs seemed to transform into political groupies, delighting in receiving a handshake from the president as he left the room. Political figures who mixed with students and Obama fans included Opposition Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek, veteran federal Liberal MP and Speaker Bronwyn Bishop, former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan and former Governor-General Quentin Bryce. The president also acknowledged Australia has had a 'healthy debate' about action to stop climate change but he said that if China and the United States could strike a deal on the global threat - as they did earlier this week: 'We can get this done.' Students described Obama's speech as 'absolutely phenomenal' President Obama said he wanted his daughter's to be able to come and visit the Great Barrier Reef . A large crowd awaited US President Barack Obama's address at the University of Queensland . The crowd was already working itself up into a lather prior to Mr Obama's speech, as iconic American songs such as Stevie Wonder's 'Signed, Sealed, Delivered' played over the speakers. 'How could he not inspire you,' said University of Queensland student, Stuart Kinsella, who said he was lucky enough to win tickets to the event through the university. 'He's Barack Obama - what more could I say.' Several students Daily Mail Australia spoke to following the speech felt the president had delivered with his address. 'Words can't describe it, absolutely phenomenal,' said Sophia Aston, 17, Mount St Michael's college in Ashgrove. There was certainly an almighty roar as the president finally exited the room, with a wave. HE WANTS TO GET OUT HERE MORE . It’s good to be back in Australia. The only problem in Australia is I’ve got to sit in conferences and talk to politicians instead of going to the beach. A DRINK, ANYONE? OBAMA: ‘My staff was very excited for ‘Brisvegas’. When I arrived they advised i needed some XXXX.’ (Shouting from the crowd) OBAMA: ‘You have some?’ CROCODILE INSURANCE . ‘When I went out to Darwin to inaugurate the new rotation of the U.S. marines there, the mayor - I think it was the mayor - took out crocodile insurance... which disturbed me. HIS AMBASSADOR EXPLAINS CROCODILE INSURANCE . ‘He described to me how crocodiles kill a lot more people than sharks. And that there’s a lot of things in Australia that can kill you.’ HIS TRIP HERE AS A LITTLE BOY: . ‘I learnt to speak a little Strayan. I’m tempted to give it a burl. 'Hah. That’s about as far as I can go.' Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Barack Obama smiled for a photo opportunity in the reading room at Parliament House .

"Serious: Ben Monksummers was alarmed when he saw his high-velocity rifles on the baggage carousel . A Team GB rifle shooter accused easyJet of committing a 'serious offence' after they put his £11,000 guns arsenal on a public airport baggage carousel. Ben Monksummers, 22, of Gillingham, Dorset, who is currently on a placement in the Netherlands as part of his law degree, booked a return flight back to the UK to see his family, with the no frills airline. But on his return trip to the Netherlands, Mr Monksummers, who has competed in international rifle events for Team GB, was shocked to see his high-velocity rifles making their way around the public luggage collection carousel at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. 'Anyone could have walked out of that building with restricted firearms of a value of £11,000. 'This is a very serious offence' he said. And it wasn't the first event in which the budget carrier had left him reeling. Ben, a diabetic, had already been fined 55 euros (around £44) to take his medication on board the flight to the UK. The sportsman has since lodged a formal complaint with easyJet over the incidents, which occurred at the end of October. An easyJet spokesman said: 'We apologise for any inconvenience Mr Monksummers experienced. 'We have procedures in place to ensure that any firearms baggage goes through specific channels, therefore we are currently investigating why this didn't happen on this occasion. Mr Monksummers' arsenal included rifles such as the 50m rifle prone (file picture) Anyone could have walked out with restricted firearms of a value of £11,000, Mr Monksummers said . 'The safety and security of its passengers and crew is easyJet's highest priority. 'We always advise passengers to contact us in advance if they need to carry medication on board the aircraft. 'In these instances our customer service team advises passengers that it is only possible to carry medical equipment or medication in the cabin as additional in-cabin baggage upon presentation of a doctor's certificate stating the necessity of it.' Ben Monksummers (pictured closest) in action at the Open English Championships earlier this year, where he took Bronze . The airline have apologised to Mr Monksummers, and are investigating why his firearms did not go through the correct channels . Arms and explosives such as handguns, automatic weapons, munitions, fireworks, flares, smoke canisters and crackers, are strictly forbidden on easyJet aircrafts. But firearms and ammunition for hunting and sporting purposes may be accepted as checked Baggage. The airline's website says: 'The carriage of firearms is strictly limited. Passengers must produce the original of the valid documentation showing proof of ownership and legal authority for the possession of the firearm(s), photocopies of such documentation will not be accepted. Without such documentation, firearms WILL NOT be carried.'","Ben Monksummers, of Dorset, has competed in international rifle contests .

"Two women who kicked to death another woman outside a bar were sentenced on Friday to six years in prison by a judge who chastised them for not walking away and denounced bystanders who shot cell phone video rather than break up the melee. Candace Brito, 27, and Vanesa Zavala, 26, cried softly as the judge also ordered them to pay $5,000 each in fines and a combined $3,500 in funeral costs to the family of 23-year-old Annie Kim Pham, an aspiring writer and newlywed who was taken off life support and died two days after the fight earlier this year. Family members of the two defendants and Pham fought back tears as Orange County Superior Court Judge Thomas M. Goethals said the case was a horrible tragedy for all involved. He decried bystanders who shot cell phone video of the January fight but did not intervene. The footage was key evidence at trial. 'Why didn't you two walk away? You're not gang members. You're not fighters. You had been essentially law-abiding, nice young women,'the judge said, raising his voice. 'And yet ... you were all in the fight up to your elbows. If any of you had just swallowed your pride and walked away none of us would be sitting here.' Scroll down for video . You were wrong: Judge Thomas M. Goethals speaks about the case and scorns those filming the fight instead of intervening  before handing down his sentence to Candace Marie Brito and Vanesa Tapia Zavala . Sentenced: Candace Brito, 27, and Vanesa Zavala, 26, were sentenced to six years in prison on Friday for beating Annie 'Kim' Pham to death outside of a Santa Ana nightclub . Brain Dead: Pham was repeatedly kicked in the head and left unconscious outside of the Santa Ana night club, she was declared brain dead when she arrived at the hospital . Brito and Zavala had been charged with second-degree murder, which would have carried a possible life term, but a jury in July opted for the lesser conviction of voluntary manslaughter. The two faced a minimum of three years and a maximum of 11 years in prison. Katie Nguyen, Pham's stepsister, recalled holding Pham's hand as she lay in a coma in the hospital. Pham's family later donated her organs according to her wishes. 'I remember crying so much my eyes were unable to produce any more tears,' Nguyen said. 'She needed to grow old, have kids and see me get married — but that would not happen.' Video: On-lookers captured video footage of the beating on their cell phones showing Pham being kicked repeatedly but did nothing to stop the horrific fight, says the judge . Injury: The coroner listed the aspiring writer's cause of death as blunt force injury of the head . Brito said she prays each day to Pham, asking for forgiveness, and Zavala — who has a 4-year-old son — said as a parent herself she can't imagine Pham's father's pain. 'I will live with this for the rest of my life. I know that you will never forget this, but I hope someday you can forgive,' Brito said shortly before the sentence was read. According to trial testimony, the fight began as Pham and her friends waited in line to get into a hotspot in downtown Santa Ana called The Crobsy. Brito, Zavala and their friends were leaving the bar and the two groups bumped into one another. Charges: Jurors chose to convict the women of the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter instead of second-degree murder, which carried a potential life sentence . Situation:  Thomas M. Goethals, Orange County superior court judge, asked the defendants why they hadn't just walked away saying that if they had done so, none of them would be in that situation . According to testimony, Pham and Emilia Calderon, a friend of Brito and Zavala's, exchanged words and then Pham swore and threw the first punch, starting a fight that quickly turned into a chaotic melee involving dozens of people. As Pham and Calderon wrestled on the sidewalk, prosecutors said Brito and Zavala kicked her in the head.  Calderon was not charged in the case. Zavala's attorney, Kenneth Reed, argued that his client didn't kick Pham and that punches from other people might have killed her. Brito's attorney, Michael Molfetta, argued his client reacted in self-defense because she thought her friend was in danger.","Court Judge Thomas M.

"Twitter debt worth £1.1billion ($1.7billion) has been rated as 'junk' by a U.S. credit agency causing the value of shares to be slashed by 6 per cent. Standard and Poor's said the 'speculative' rating was issued because the social network is pouring cash into expanding its user numbers while still operating at a loss. The agency warned that it could be 2016 before the social network turns a profit. In the latest quarter of this year Twitter posted a net loss of £112million ($175.5million), despite a surge in earnings. A U.S. credit rating agency has classed £1. 1billion-worth ($1.7billion-worth) of Twitter's debt as 'junk', saying it could be 2016 before the site turns a profit as it pours cash into expanding its user numbers . S&P's said in order to improve the rating, Twitter needed to develop more ways of making money, launch new products, and improve its earnings. The company has been aggressively buying up other firms in order to add to its appeal, boosting regular user numbers to around the 264million mark. However, that figure means it still lags far behind the likes of Facebook, which has 864million active users, making it more attractive to advertisers. However, it is not all bad news for Twitter, which first launched in 2006 and listed as a public company last year. S&P's said that, in the short-term at least, Twitter 'will continue to experience very strong growth and not encounter a significant increase in competitive pressure.' The agency added: 'We expect the company to experience very high growth over the next two to three years as it expands internationally and grows revenue as well.'

"A luxury travel company is offering epic 18-day adventure around Asia where guests will travel by private jet and helicopter, stay in luxury five-star resorts, and get VIP access to off-limits historic landmarks. Those who are willing to shell out over £36,600 will be jetting off to exotic locations in China, Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka in the most luxurious fashion. 'Ultra luxe bespoke' travel company Remote Lands and renowned hotel brand Amanresorts have teamed up to offer the extravagant journey during which guests will fly by private jet between destinations and stay at Amanresorts in Beijing and Hangzhou in China, Thimpu and Paro in Bhutan, Rajasthan and Ranthambore in India, and Galle and Tangalle in Sri Lanka. 18 days of decadence: Luxury travel company Remote Lands has unveiled a jaw-dropping private jet journey across Asia . Taking glamping to new heights: One stop on the tour will be a luxury safari in Ranthambore, India, the first of eight Amanresorts properties . Room for two: The 'tents' on the safari boast a 20-ft canopy, king-size beds and air-conditioning . The trip will take place annually, with the first running from October 3-20 next year. In the Forbidden City in Beijing, guests will have the opportunity to tour the Inner Court, where the Chong Hue Gong Palace is located. The perfectly preserved structure is normally off-limits to the general public. In Bhutan, they will visit Bhutan’s revered Tiger’s Nest monastery, which clings precariously to a cliff face at 2,952ft above ground. In Ranthambore, guests will stay in luxury tents that give a new meaning to 'glamping'. Each tent is a grand 1,160 square feet, with a soaring 20-ft canopy. Fitted with a king-size bed and soaking tub, they are air-conditioned in summer and heated in winter. Spectacular sightseeing: In Bhutan, guests will visit the Tiger’s Nest monastery,  2,952 feet above the ground . VIP access: A tour of the inner court of The Forbidden City in Beijing, usually off-limits to the public, is on the itinerary . While there, they will experience guided wildlife safaris through Ranthambore National Park, the former hunting ground of the Maharajah. The 154 square mile park presents the best opportunities to search for leopards, jungle cats, hyenas and sloth bears, and is the best region in India for spotting the Bengal tiger. Other tour highlights include touring the Pink City of Jaipur, a walk along the Great Wall of China, and a barbecue with fire dancers on a pristine Sri Lankan beach. The journey costs $57,750 (approximately £36,700) per person based on double occupancy, with a $23,000 (£14,600) single supplement. Chill out time: A luxurious stay at Amanwella resort in Sri Lanka is the final destination on the trip .

Remote Lands co-founder and CEO Catherine Heald will lead the trip, and revealed that one of their two eight-person jets had already been filled. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Heald said that the extravagant trip was inspired by 'Amanjunkies' - high net-worth travellers who seek to stay in every one of the 27 Aman properties around the world. She said: 'Recognizing this, we set out to create the most exclusive private jet journey on offer. 'Our private jet journey across Asia covers 8 Amanresorts over 18 nights and includes extraordinary experiences that would otherwise be impossible such as dining with the retired Bhutanese Ambassador to the United Nations and the USA, visiting areas of Beijing's Forbidden City that are closed to the public, meeting Indian royalty and prominent Sri Lanka artists and intellectuals.' Flying in style: Two Falcon 2000 executive jets will transport guests between destinations within Asia .

"It was a case that echoed another famous lawsuit against McDonald's 20 years ago, but investigators are claiming this one's a phony. Selena Edwards, 38, of Victorville claimed that an unsecured lid on a cup of piping hot McDonald's coffee led to a spill that burned her right hand, providing photos to bolster a case in which she was seeking $10,000. But  state officials say  her evidence was falsified, and the San Bernardino County district attorney has slapped Edwards with 21 felony counts of insurance fraud and workers' compensation fraud. Caution hot: Selena Edwards, 38, claimed she received second-degree burns after spilling hot coffee on her hand, but investigators are saying her case is fraudulent . 'We discovered that some of the photos were from a hospital website,' the state's Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones told the Los Angeles Times. 'We contacted her medical provider and discovered she hadn’t received any medical treatment.' According to Jones, Edwards's insurance company had doubts about  her injuries, leading them to refer her claims to state investigators. Edwards originally claimed that she visited a McDonald's in Fontana on January 28, 2013, getting coffee from the drive-through window. The lid on the coffee was not secure, and spilled on her hand, causing second-degree burns, in the version of events now disputed by investigators. 'By copying legitimate burn photos from the Internet, Edwards attempted to make a profit from another person’s pain and suffering and for this she will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,' said Jones. Settlements: McDonald's has settled numerous coffee burn cases in the past according to the Wall Street Journal, but fought Stella Liebeck after she received severe third-degree burns that disabled her . In 1994, a jury awarded an 81-year-old former department store clerk Stella Liebeck $2.9million after hot coffee spilled into her lap, causing third-degree burns. In a case that has been mocked and misunderstood for years, The Wall Street Journal reported that McDonald's refused to cover Liebeck's hospital fees, only offering her $800. It is not clear if Liebeck's case prompted the change, but the New York Times reports that a later handbook for McDonald's advised to keep coffee 10 degrees cooler than before.","Selena Edwards, 38, of Victorville claimed she was burned on the hand by coffee from a McDonald's drive-through and was seeking $10,000 .

"Former Manchester United trainee Josh King scored a famous FA Cup hat-trick as Stoke City boss Mark Hughes suffered a nightmare return to Ewood Park. Rovers fans mockingly chanted 'Hughesy, Hughesy, What's the score?' as their former manager watched his Premier League outfit collapse after being reduced to ten men on the stroke of half-time. Despite going in front through Peter Crouch, Stoke couldn't handle King, a 23-year-old Norwegian-born striker who left Old Trafford after making just two first-team appearances and was only playing on Saturday because Rovers star striker Jordan Rhodes needed a rest.

He drew his side level with a header and after Rudy Gestede had put the Championship underdogs ahead with a penalty, King added two more in the second half by out-sprinting the Stoke back line. By that time, Stoke were a man short with Geoff Cameron dismissed for the foul that led to Gestede's spot-kick. 'Kingy will get the headlines and rightly so,' said Rovers manager Gary Bowyer. 'He has had a great education at Manchester United and shown here what he is capable of. 'The challenge for him now is to produce it on a regular basis. What can I tell you about him? He lives in Manchester and drives a car that's too fast, probably the same speed he can run.' Hughes, who was Blackburn's manager between 2004 and 2008 before leaving for Manchester City, wasn't happy that his players wilted so easily under pressure. 'Blackburn were direct but that is valid. They executed their game plan better than us. I have no complaints,' he said. Even so, Hughes will be hurting this morning. He won the FA Cup four times as a player and fancied emulating the Stoke team that reached the final in 2011, hence he named his strongest side - save for regular cup keeper Jack Butland for Asmir Begovic. It started well for the visitors when Peter Crouch turned in a Victor Moses corner to open the scoring after 10 minutes and they should have added a second when Mame Biram Diouf blazed over from six yards. However, Stoke's new vulnerability at set pieces cost them after 36 minutes, Shane Duffy headed a corner goalwards and King got the final touch off his head from a couple of yards to equalise. When referee Anthony Taylor signalled eight minutes of injury time at the end of the first half – due to a shoulder injury to Ben Marshall - Stoke were rocking badly. Butland fluffed a cross and needed Philipp Wollscheid to clear off the line. Stoke's indecision was becoming a problem and in the next attack, Gestede was brought down by Geoff Cameron, and Mr Taylor pointed the spot and sent off the American defender. 'The letter of the law says he has to be sent off,' said Bowyer, and Hughes wasn't ready to argue. Gestede coolly sent Butland the wrong way from the spot for his 13th goal of the season.

He was so quick for the first that Marc Muniesa pulled a hamstring trying to catch him and after collapsing in agony, needed help as he hobbled off to be replaced by Steve Sidwell.

"They are known as man's best friend. And this is particularly true after years of faithful companionship. Now, devoted dog owners have put forward their aging pets for a series of majestic portraits. The stunning collection, named 'Old Faithful Photo Project, features a range of senior canines, including a cancer-stricken English Bulldog and a 12-year-old old Chihuahua with one eye. Majestic: This  collection of portraits, created by 35-year-old photographer Pete Thorne and named 'Old Faithful Photo Project, features a range of aging canines, including a 12-year-old old Chihuahua with one eye (above) Sick: It also includes a cancer-stricken English Bulldog named Mance (above), which has an 'asymmetrical charm', according to Mr Thorne. Due to Mance's fragility, the photo shoot was based at the owner's house . A natural: This photo shows Weezee, a 10-year-old Pug, who was well behaved and 'very easy to photograph' Ageing: Finnegan, a Brussels Griffon smooth coat or a Petit Brabançon, is 12 years old. He sports a red coat, weighs 6lbs and is small for his breed. He also has a heart murmur and has had multiple teeth pulled out . Stunning: Mr Thorne is a big fan of puppies, but thought it was time to give their older counterparts - including this dog named Spud - a shot at the spotlight. He later posted the impressive portraits on his Facebook page . Posing: This Chinese Crested dog, named Colonel Sanders, is a purebred show dog with best in show lineage dating back several generations to Asia. Due to old age, his shallow-rooted teeth are slowly falling out . It also includes a 14-year-old therapy dog named Dallas, a 16-year-old Cairn Terrier mix, several Chinese Crested canines and a camera-friendly Pug called Weezee. The  pictures were captured by Pete Thorne, a 35-year-old photographer from Toronto who is a big fan of puppies, but thought it was time to give their older counterparts a shot at the spotlight. Alongside the regal-looking images, posted on Mr Thorne's Facebook page, many owners have written short biographies for their four-legged pets, some of which have since passed away. 'We no longer chase squirrels, only hunt them down with intense staring,' one person wrote of Bodley, a 12-year-old boxer-Staffordshire terrier mix. Smiling: Another image depicts Elmo (above), a 14-year-old Pitbull who was the first dog shot by Mr Thorne . Getting on: Hogarth - aka 'Mr Fusspot' - was also pictured by the photographer for the 'Old Faithful' project . Greying: Mason, an 11-year-old Chocolate Labrador, was put forward for the project by his owner, Judith . Saved: Toto, 16, a Cairn Terrier mix, was rescued by a vet when he was seven years old. He was scheduled to be euthanized due to urination issues, but the vet refused to go through with it and instead took him home . 'Though his arthritis limits his flexibility, it does not limit his enthusiasm for walks and exploration through brown crunchy leaves.' Another owner said of a 14-year-old therapy dog called Dallas: 'At age 11 she was diagnosed with Auto-immune Encephaliti.! Her neurologist didn't expect her to survive. 'But she proved him wrong and rallied through the disease and has been in great health since. She still enjoys trotting about for a ball, swimming and an occasional squirrel stalk.' Deep in thought: Speaking of Jackson (pictured),  a 14-year-old Black Labrador mix, Mr Thorne said: 'There's something about the expression on his face that seems like he is peering into your soul' A final photo: Clovis, 14, sadly passed away not too long after this breathtaking portrait of him was taken . Adopted: Benjamin was found as a stray and ended up in a shelter before his owner, Sandy, adopted him . Less active: 'We no longer chase squirrels, only hunt them down with intense staring,' one person wrote of Bodley (pictured), a 12-year-old boxer-Staffordshire terrier mix who was pictured by Mr Thorne . Although not his original intention, Mr Thorne has grown to realize the lasting impact of his portraits, particularly those featuring now-deceased pets. Many owners have followed up with him after their dogs have died, telling him the incredible stories of their companionship, some of which involve animals being rescued from pet mills or the streets. Mr Thorne hopes 'Old Faithful' will one day be featured as a gallery show or published as a book. Camera-friendly: Finnegan the Brussels Griffon smooth coat is pictured by Mr Thorne from another angle . Showing off her fangs: Sheba, one of the first dogs photographed, was described by Mr Thorne as 'a bit frail' Excitable: Emmy, a Wolfhound mix, 'got so excited for her photo shoot she pooped in a shoe', said Mr Thorne .","Majestic photos, taken by photographer Pete Thorne, capture aging dogs .

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has admitted that Wayne Rooney might be his best striker but insists the Old Trafford captain has to continue playing where it suits the team. Van Gaal's decision to play Rooney in midfield for the majority of this season has come under scrutiny with United accused of playing dull football despite a run of just one defeat in 18 matches. England manager Roy Hodgson has confirmed Rooney – who is closing on the all-time goalscoring records for Manchester United and England - will operate as a striker at international level, saying: 'He's a goalscorer, isn't he?' Wayne Rooney has looked out of place playing in midfield under Louis van Gaal this season . Rooney's heat map against Burnley shows that he spent the majority of the game behind the halfway line . The Dutch manager insists he has been forced to accommodate Rooney to best suit the team . The United boss, whose side travel to League One Preston North End on Monday night for a potentially awkward FA Cup fifth round tie, has tried to explain his policy on Rooney. He said he understood Hodgson's position regarding England but argued he had a different set of issues at United, with Robin van Persie, Radomel Falcao, Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson also available up front. 'Maybe, he (Rooney) is the best striker but I have to look at where a player can make the biggest contribution, and compare that to other players also. 'The composition of the team is more important than the individual player. I am sorry but that's the way it is. Rooney probably gives more contribution to Mr Hodgson playing in a striker's position, and I'd also put him there if I was coach of England. 'He has to compare Wayne Rooney with the strikers he can put in the line-up, and that is a consideration I have to make at United and my consideration is a different one. I have to choose between Falcao, van Persie and all the other strikers I have.' Van Gaal's admission that Rooney is not playing in midfield through a lack of ability as a centre-forward does raise doubts about how he views some of United's big-money signings in central areas. England manager Roy Hodgson (centre) has criticised Van Gaal's use of his leading striker . Van Gaal also has to find a place for forwards Radamel Falcao and Robin van Perise in his team . Struggling Falcao will be judged on more than just goals alone, insists Van Gaal . Juan Mata (£38million), Ander Herrera (£28million) and Marouane Fellaini (£27million) are considered inferior midfield players to Rooney and the United boss clearly doesn't see Angel di Maria (£60million) or Ashley Young (£18million) as the answer in central midfield. Fellaini's size and physical strength may get him a start at Deepdale having played an important part in seeing off another lower league team, Cambridge United, in the last round. Though youngster James Wilson is pushing for a start, there may be another chance given to Colombian striker Falcao whose four goals this season have been a poor return given the hype when he signed on deadline day in the summer. With Robin van Persie due to be rested for a minor ailment, van Gaal defended Falcao's contribution. United have to decide by April whether to turn his loan move from Monaco into a permanent £43million deal. 'I shall not only judge on the goals. It is a bigger view than that,' said van Gaal. 'There are more aspects for a striker, an assist is an aspect and being available on the pitch for your fellow players is also an aspect. 'You have seen the header back for Chris Smalling (for United's opening goal against Burnley on Wednesday night) was from Falcao.' Despite United being in a top-four position having finished seventh last season under David Moyes, van Gaal has faced plenty of criticism in the past week with West Ham manager Sam Allardyce saying the team played long-ball football last weekend, and ex-United great Paul Scholes saying the players looked miserable. Rooney has been preferred to using players like Juan Mata (left) and Marouane Fellaini in midfield . Rooney celebrates scoring after scoring his last goal against Newcastle at Old Trafford on Boxing Day . Goalkeeper David de Gea has been United's best performing player by far this season . The Dutch manager, who is used to working in high-pressure arenas like Barcelona and Bayern Munich, is coming out fighting, and not even United's best player this season goalkeeper David de Gea is exempt. Asked if the Spaniard had won a lot of points for United this season, van Gaal snapped back: 'I think he doesn't save many points because he is my goalkeeper and his obligation is to hold balls. And you are thinking that is an exception for other goalkeepers and it is not like that, I am sorry for that.' United have not won the FA Cup since 2004 and the competition represents their only chance of winning their first trophy of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Van Gaal is expected to name a strong line-up – with Rooney again in midfield – though he is missing Phil Jones (calf) and Michael Carrick (ankle) with Daley Blind (head) doubtful.","Wayne Rooney has found himself playing in midfield under Louis van Gaal .

"Houston police have arrested a man in the abduction of a 6-year-old girl who escaped after going into a Target store and alerting a customer that she was kidnapped. Police say 23-year-old Joaquin Ramos was captured early Thursday and is charged with kidnapping. Investigators say the child, identified as Kelly Tellez, did not appear harmed during the harrowing one-hour ordeal, which played out Wednesday afternoon when she was snatched from her apartment complex. The Houston man was apprehended this morning at a local hospital where, according to police, his pregnant wife was in labor. Scroll down for video . Snatced in broad daylight: Joaquin Ramos, 23 (left), has been charged with kidnapping in connection to the  abduction of Kelly Tellez (right) Crime scene: The little girl was snatched in broad daylight from this parking garage in Houston just steps away from her mother . Tellez’s aunt, Marlene Fernandez, told the station KHOU11 that she was glad Ramos had been caught, adding that the 23-year-old will soon get him comeuppance. ‘He’s going to pay in jail because we already know what they do to guys like that in jail,’ Miss Fernandez said. According to Houston police, Kelly and her mother pulled into a parking garage at around 3.30pm Wednesday, and her mother proceeded to unload her vehicle. The 6-year-old went to look at some ice on a fence nearby when a man later identified as Joaquin Ramos pulled up in his silver Jeep Cherokee, forced the child into the backseat against her will and took off. Lucky escape: Ramos brought Tellez to this Target in Memorial City Mall, where the girl was able to alert a customer about her abduction . Valuable tip: Ramos' family revealed his whereabouts to police after seeing his photo from a Target surveillance camera (left) and a snapshot of his silver Jeep (right) Tellez’s mother attempted to pursue the kidnapper on foot before returning to the garage and giving chase in her vehicle, but she quickly lost sight of the man. Shortly after 4pm, Ramos was captured on a surveillance camera entering the Target store at Memorial City Mall with the abducted girl. Police say Ramos told Kelly he needed to use the restroom and instructed her to do the same. Once in a bathroom, the 6-year-old told a stranger that she had been kidnapped. The customer informed store management, who went into the restroom and rescued Kelly Tellez, but Ramos escaped the store before authorities were able to arrest him. Little Kelly was taken to Texas Children’s Hospital as a precaution before being reunited with her family. Rescued: Police came to Kelly's aid and made sure she was unharmed . Good news: The 6-year-old was reunited with her mother, who lost her husband in a tragic wood chipper accident just months earlier . Meanwhile, the suspect’s relatives saw photos of him and his Jeep on the news that night and contacted investigators with information on Ramos’ whereabouts. Just before 5am, police officers apprehended Ramos at Memorial Hermann Hospital, where his wife had just given birth hours earlier. Ramos allegedly confessed to kidnapping the girl, whom he said he did not know. He did not provide a motive to the abduction. Kelly's aunt, Marlene Fernandez, said her sister lost her husband in a wood chipper accident just a few months ago, and if something were to happen to her daughter she would have 'gone insane.' ABC13 reported that Ramos lived in the same apartment complex as Tellez and her mother. His criminal record includes only a sole misdemeanor shoplifting arrest.","Joaquin Ramos, 23, was arrested in a Houston hospital and charged with kidnapping .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has said qualifying for the Champions League again would be a bigger achievement than running Manchester City close to the Premier League title last season. And the Anfield boss, whose side face City at Anfield on Sunday two places outside the top four, claims the pressure is on Manchester United and Arsenal in the race to get among Europe's elite. Rodgers is on a 10-game unbeaten league run though Thursday's Europa Cup exit against Besiktas was costly because it closed one possible route to the Champions League and upset preparations with the players not returning to Merseyside until 4am on Friday morning. Brendan Rodgers says finishing in the top four this season would eclipse last year's achievements . Liverpool were knocked out of Europe in midweek, but have had a busier schedule this season . He believes the club's early-season woes are behind them – they were 10th as recently as December - and says the players deserve credit for overcoming the loss of Luis Suarez, a long-term injury to Daniel Sturridge, the impending departure of Steven Gerrard, the extra demands of European competition and the difficulty in assimilating eight new signings made over the summer. 'If we arrive in the top four this year, with everything we have been though, it will be a greater achievement than last year. Absolutely,' said Rodgers. 'It was certainly an incredible achievement to go so close last year but we only had to play one game a week. Making the top four this year would certainly be better. 'Our backs were against the wall, we weren't playing very well and when you don't win games you get criticism. No one likes it but you have to accept it. There is no doubt this season we have leareda lot and by the end of it I will be a better manager.' One of Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool are set to miss out on Champions League football next season, a hammer blow to any of those huge clubs. Rodgers claimed: 'I think there is probably a big pressure on Manchester United and Arsenal from where they've been probably over the last 15 to 20 years. Last season, with Luis Suarez in the team, Rodgers' side finished second behind Manchester City . 'Manchester United is a club that has been synonymous with that and probably through to at least the quarter-finals of the competition. Arsene Wenger's record of getting them qualified has been outstanding. That is what you are up against. But I think it tells you the competition in this country. It's quite exciting really that you are fighting until the end.' Liverpool's famous 3-2 win against City last April put them top of the Premier League and seven poitns clear of Manuel Pellegrini's side, though they did have two games in hand. But a home defeat against Chelsea and draw at Crystal Palace cost them and they eventually fell two points short. Rodgers insists he has been too busy to dwell on it this season but acknowledges it is something he could look back on in years to come. Of more immediate importance is trying to get Liverpool back into the Champions League after this season's disappointment that saw them exit at the group stage. 'That is the priority,' says the manager. Liverpool's reputation worldwide is second only to Manchester United largely due to their success in the 1970s and 80s but with Chelsea and Manchester City growing their fan bases, owner John W Henry needs to keep the club among the elite to protect his brand. Rodgers talks to his team before the penalty exit against Besiktas on Thursday night in Istanbul . Liverpool take on champions City on Sunday hoping to keep pace with Arsenal and Manchester United . United had to pay over the odds for the likes of Angel di Maria, Marcos Rojo and Ander Herrera to compensate for missing out on the Champions League. Liverpool haven't got similar cash to burn on transfer fees or wages – they only escaped FPP punishment last week because they successfully argued part of their spending was for an expansion of their stadium. 'We are about developing and creating world-class talent. Liverpool is still talked about as a worldwide club, which is important,' he said. Jordan Henderson is likely to return to the team for the crucial Premier League clash against Manchester City . Mario Balotelli, replaced by Rodgers on Thursday, is in the squad to face his former side on Sunday . 'I think the top four looked a long way off from where we were but we always believed that once we could work together and have more working time together, we could challenge. Again it is the elite competition, the Champions League, it is where the best players and managers want to work and we put ourselves in a position where we have the opportunity to do that.' Jordan Henderson and Lazar Markovic are expected to return from the side that lost on penalties to Besiktas though Gerrard is still out with a hamstring problem. There could be a place in the 18-man squad for Mario Balotelli who helped City win the league in 2012.","Liverpool finished second last season after coming close to title .

"Forgotten figure: Last year only half of English 18-24 year olds knew that Nelson led the Royal Navy to victory in the Battle of Trafalgar . Schools should axe Labour’s citizenship classes and devote more time to British history studies, MPs will say today. The idea is one of a string of measures being put forward to reverse the decline in history teaching which has seen the subject all but disappear in state schools in some parts of the country. Research by the All-Party History Group found that fewer than 30 per cent of 16-year-olds in state schools were entered for the GCSE in 2010, compared with 55 per cent of pupils in grammar schools and 48 per cent in private schools. In one local authority area – Knowsley, in Merseyside – just four pupils passed the exam. MPs said schools should be allowed to replace citizenship classes with history. Citizenship was introduced as a compulsory subject a decade ago. Pupils study topics such as crime, justice and politics, and how to be an ‘active citizen’ by voting and taking part in society. But critics say it is often poorly taught and of little value. The group said there was a ‘wide educational divide in this country when it comes to studying history’, with teaching of the subject becoming concentrated in affluent areas. In more deprived areas the subject is often ‘neglected or ignored’, with some head teachers shunning it because it is seen as difficult. The cross-party group is calling on Education Secretary Michael Gove to introduce a series of measures to boost history teaching. Last year Mr Gove expressed his horror at a survey that found that half of English 18 to 24-year-olds did not know that Nelson led the Royal Navy to victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, with a similar proportion unaware that the Romans built Hadrian’s Wall. Called on: The cross party group of MPs want Education Secretary Michael Gove to introduce new measures to boost history teaching . Today’s report warns that children are taught too narrow a range of history, often learning about the Second World War and the Tudors several times during their school careers. Even where a broader range of topics is taught, it is often done in a disjointed way, giving children little idea of how events in the past relate to one another. The report calls for the introduction of a new British history qualification at 16, which would look at the subject in chronological order. MPs heard that making history compulsory to the age of 16 would be difficult because it would require a trebling of the number of history teachers. But they urged ministers to work towards the goal. Tory MP Chris Skidmore, vice-chairman of the All-Party History Group, said: ‘An understanding of British history is vitally important for our national identity and understanding where we came from and where we are going. ‘I would prefer history to be compulsory to 16, as it is in most western countries, but for the moment, we should ensure that every pupil, regardless of background, gets the chance to study British history across a span of centuries.’ ■ Children’s author Philip Pullman says the way books are studied at school is like ‘torture’. Pupils end up hating the books because teachers tear them apart in an attempt to reveal what they ‘really mean’.","Cross-party group of MPs calling on Education Secretary to introduce measures to boost history teaching .

"A mother who was looking over photographs of a family day out was left shocked after discovering the face of a 'ghost child' next to her children climbing a tree. Michelle Mason from Stoke-on-Trent, had taken the picture in August of two of her children while on a family outing to Cannock Chase in Staffordshire. While on the trip, the mother-of-three stopped to snap an image of her two children Sophia and Lee, who were climbing a tree. The ghostly figure, circled, which Mrs Michelle Mason discovered after looking over a picture taken on a family day out . But after looking back over the picture she discovered the figure of what appears to be a Victorian child. Mrs Mason, 39, explained: 'We were on a family walk one afternoon and the kids decided to climb a tree. 'I stopped to take a photo but it wasn’t until I got home that I spotted a child’s face looking back at me. 'I couldn’t believe it when I looked closer at the picture and there was a child, standing with a wheel or a hoop in their hand. Michelle Mason, who says she has discovered the face of a 'ghost child' in a family photo . 'It has really freaked me out. I don’t like anything like that. 'I would love to know more about the child in the picture. I am convinced it is a ghost, possibly from the Victorian times. 'When you look closely at the photo you can see the deep dark eyes. It definitely bares a striking resemblance to the black-eyed child that has been spotted around Cannock Chase. 'I don’t think it looks evil though, or like it wants to cause any harm to my children. They were both a bit spooked by it at first, but any child would be.' Now Mrs Mason is keen to find out more about the history of Cannock Chase in a bid to reveal who the 'ghost child' might be. She explained: 'I would love to find out more about the history of that area and if there are any experts who can help me out. It is a fascinating subject. 'I have had a lot of feedback from people, and it is split pretty evenly between people thinking it is a little boy or a little girl. 'Different people have spotted different things, such as a hand holding a hoop or a stick. Everyone sees differently I think depending on what they believe.' The full-time carer, added: 'Some people have said that I must have used Photoshop but I couldn’t tell you the first thing about that, I have no idea how to use anything like that. I just took the photo on our family compact camera. 'But that is most likely just people who are sceptical or don’t believe in the afterlife, that is always the first thing they say.'","Michelle Mason took a snap of her children climbing a tree on a day out .

"Nothing will have gladdened Louis van Gaal more this season than what happened in the aftermath of Manchester United’s third and final goal against Newcastle United on Boxing Day. No sooner had Robin van Persie expertly headed in Wayne Rooney’s pinpoint diagonal cross than the Dutchman turned to his team-mate, pointed at him in gratitude before they embraced like old friends. It hasn't always been like that. Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes couldn't get two of the most talented players in the Premier League to put aside their egos, and felt forced to take sides. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's preview for Spurs vs Manchester United . Wayne Rooney runs over to embrace goalscorer Robin van Persie after Manchester United went three goals ahead against Newcastle United on Boxing Day. They would go on to win the match 3-1 . Van Persie connects firmly with a header after getting free of Newcastle defender Steven Taylor (left) Goalkeeper Jak Alnwick can only watch on as Van Persie's well-directed header flies beyond him . Van Gaal has succeeded in repairing the sometimes fractious relationship between Van Persie and Rooney . Ferguson was a Van Persie man to the extent that Rooney ended up hellbent on trying to move to Chelsea. Moyes was a Rooney man, leaving Van Persie’s friends angry that their striker was being over-trained in spite of being vulnerable to injuries. As he prepares to enter a cauldron at White Hart Lane on Sunday — Van Gaal spurned Tottenham earlier this year once the opportunity arose at Old Trafford — the Dutchman can be proud of his biggest achievement at his new club, making Van Persie and Rooney live up to the United part of their club’s name. Rooney has been given the captain’s armband that Van Persie coveted, RVP has the main centre-forward’s position that Wayne coveted. And it hasn’t seemed to cause any ill-feeling. Against Newcastle, Van Persie peeled wide from his No 9 berth to give Rooney the space to run from deep and score twice in the first half. Rooney then unselfishly planted a ball on top of Van Persie’s head to set up a 3-1 victory. Luke Shaw (left) posted this picture on Instagram of himself and Ashley Young on the way to Tottenham . Rooney scored twice in the comfortable United victory on Boxing Day as they cemented third in the league . United are 10 points behind leaders Chelsea and seven behind Manchester City in the Premier League table . The relationship between Van Persie and Rooney hasn't always been easy, especially last season . Remember, this was a pairing who passed to each other only once in the entire 90 minutes against Olympiacos in the Champions League first leg last season — and that was from a kick-off. They didn't even celebrate goals together at times. The word Van Gaal uses often to try and explain the camaraderie inside the United camp after seven wins and a draw in their past eight matches is ‘social’. It means a set of players who are happy to work and play together, only interested on the pitch in benefitting the team rather than themselves. ‘The attitude of my players is excellent and they have a very high social standard,’ says Van Gaal. ‘That is very important because football is a team sport between co-operating human beings. You have to be social. We have a high social standard in the team. 'Wherever I am in my career, I shall guide and manage the team in a social way of treating each other. It is also part of my philosophy. I cannot explain that in one page, it is a lot of pages. If you read my book, it is all in it. But things have improved this campaign as United continue their march up the table . Van Gaal is hoping to make it eight wins from nine matches when United travel to Tottenham on Sunday . CHELSEA .

When we are half a year further on, it shall improve even more. That’s why we have training.’ The simplicity of the message makes you wonder why Ferguson and Moyes could not pull off the same trick, particularly when the pair’s children attend the same school, to help their off-field relationship. Van Gaal has managed some of the biggest names in football with Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Holland, so he has made solving one or two personal issues at United look a doddle. Rooney is happy to play in midfield for the team, Van Persie respects Rooney as his captain. Van Persie says of his relationship with the manager: ‘I worked with Van Gaal for two years with Holland so I knew how he trained. I knew exactly what to expect. 'He warned me after the World Cup that it would take time for me to get there (top form) but I would be very very fit. Rooney has thrived in the captaincy role and also in a deeper midfield position during recent matches . Van Persie and Van Gaal forged a close relationship when the latter coached the Dutch national team . Van Persie headed straight for Van Gaal after scoring his wonderful diving header against Spain . ‘I am feeling very well now, which I wasn’t at the start of the season. So he’s right. Every single player, when you are working under Van Gaal, is balancing on the edge — physically and mentally you are concentrating every single minute of the day. 'He expects us to think about football just before we go to bed as well. It is very intense. But I love it and it is a very good way. ‘Straight away when he got the job, I realised it would be very intense years but great years as well, because of the way he trains. Every session he puts on there is always an idea and he explains himself well.’ Former player Andy Cole noted in Friday’s match programme that United seem a happier club. Van Gaal agrees: ‘I think so, I think when you win six times in a row, and you draw, and you win again, then the spirit is fantastic. Van Gaal, pictured handing out presents to United fans on Boxing Day, was linked with the Spurs job . Instead, Tottenham appointed Mauricio Pochettino, who joined from Southampton in the summer . 'I think there is happiness in the club because we are together working for one goal. We have a very good communication between all the employees in Manchester United and that is very important. ‘And we can celebrate parties, Christmas parties, and that is also important. We can work but we can also celebrate and that is very good.’ Of course, in-form Tottenham will provide a sterner test than an under-strength Newcastle did. Spurs fans will remember the club thought Van Gaal was going to be their new boss until United fluttered their eyelids while he was at his holiday home in Portugal and prompted a u-turn. Van Gaal is expecting a hot reception but it does not bother him. ‘I cannot change that. I don’t have any influence on it so I won’t make any trouble with them (Spurs fans). I’ve managed with this kind of thing at a lot of clubs. The summer is history. 'We have to play and speak about what is happening now. Now it is (Mauricio) Pochettino, the new manager, and I am the new manager of Manchester United.’ Tottenham celebrate after Christian Eriksen's goal secured a 2-1 Boxing Day win at Leicester City . Harry Kane had handed Tottenham the lead inside the first minute at the King Power Stadium . Of greater concern will be Tottenham’s run of four wins in a row under Pochettino, who eventually filled the vacancy from Southampton. In particular, Christian Eriksen has been a major influence, making those who thought he would be too lightweight for the Premier League look foolish. ‘That theory is rubbish, always rubbish,’ said Van Gaal. ‘When you have high standards you can play in the Premier League. When you’re good on the ball, you can play, and Eriksen is good on the ball. It doesn’t matter when you are less physical, not so tall or wide. 'Did you see Juan Mata for us against Newcastle? Two great assists. I think the selection of Tottenham is a high-standard selection so it’s normal they’re doing well.’ Angel di Maria’s pelvic strain means he is likely to miss out along with Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind. Van Gaal is also opposed having to play 48 hours after United’s previous game, something Uefa and Fifa do not allow in their competitions. Even so, as long as he has Van Persie and Rooney singing from the same hymn-sheet, Van Gaal will fancy his side’s chances at the club he could have joined.

"Coca-Cola has been accused of supporting the regime of Swaziland dictator King Mswati III. The Swaziland Democracy Campaign, an organisation that aims to depose Africa's last absolute monarch, has called on the multi-billion dollar drinks giant to pull out of the country immediately. The U.S.-based beverage firm owns a manufacturing plant in Swaziland - its biggest facility in Africa. Dictator: Coca-Cola has been accused of supporting the regime of Swaziland dictator King Mswati III . Mswati, who presides over one of the poorest nations in the world despite a personal wealth of £64million ($100million), has even visited Coca-Cola's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. 'Coca-Cola must know they’re doing business with the wrong people,' Swaziland Democracy Campaign spokersperson Mary Pais Da Silva told the Guardian. 'At the end of the day it doesn’t benefit the economy in any way. Their profits don’t help the average Swazi, while the king is getting richer by the day. 'Nobody should do business with the regime in Swaziland.' Coca-Cola contributes up to 40 per cent of Swaziland's gross domestic product, according to activists. The company says that Mswati doesn't receive any profits from its factory in the country. Lucky Lukhele, a spokesman for Swaziland Solidarity Network, said there 'is no such thing as a middle ground' and compared cooperating with Mswati's regime to supporting apartheid in South Africa. The drinks behemoth set up its Swaziland base in 1987 after abandoning apartheid South Africa. Multi-billion firm: Mswati has even visited Coca-Cola's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia (pictured) A spokeswoman for Coca-Cola last night said the firm adheres to the 'highest ethical standards'. Sherree Shereni said: 'King Mswati III does not receive any profits or dividends from Conco Swaziland, Coca-Cola's concentrate production plant. 'Through the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation, which was set up in Swaziland in 2001, the population of Swaziland has benefited from Coca-Cola's contributions to their social welfare in the areas of water stewardship, health, education and entrepreneurship.' Mswati's lavish lifestyle has come under fire in recent months from campaigners who have demanded democracy in Swaziland. The monarch currently rules his 1.2million subjects through informal discussion with the country's cabinet, who he appoints himself. But last year the authorities were forced to quell a string of protest against his autocratic rule. Mswati, who was educated at Sherborne School in Dorset, has repeatedly refused to consider reform. Political opposition parties in the country are banned and activists are routinely arrested or assaulted. Despite the criticism of his rule, Mswati enjoys backing from neighbouring South Africa, who recently propped up the economy of its junior neighbour with a £215million loan. Swaziland is a former British protectorate which gained independence in 1968. The vast majority of its citizens live in poverty. The population has also been ravaged by Aids and has one of the highest rates of infection in the world. Some studies have suggested that up to 40 per cent of the population could be living with the disease.","Coca-Cola own manufacturing plant in African nation .

"Disney's hit kids' movie Frozen may be the most Christian film to come out this year -- imitating Christ's sacrifice and featuring a main character that shares parallels with Satan. That's the argument Collin Garbarino, an assistant professor of history at Houston Baptist University, made on Fox and Friends on Sunday. Garbarino said the film's central relationship, between Snow Queen Elsa and her sister Anna, mirrors the sacrifices Jesus Christ made for sinners in the Bible. Scroll down for trailer . Frozen, Garbarino says, could be the most Christian movie of 2013 . 'The Christian message is that people are sinners and have these broken relationships and that Christ comes and takes on the punishment for that sin, dies a death that he didn't deserve, then is resurrected and brings reconciliation through people,' Garbarino said on the program. 'And the problem [is that] Elsa has broken relationships. And she has guilt and she pushes people away. And her sister is sort of like a Christ figure who pursues her.' 'Anna comes and pursues and when she pursues [Elsa], she has to die and then she's resurrected which kind of proves the strength of her love and it brings reconciliation and Elsa is saved because her sister dies, and these are very strong Christian themes,' he continued. Garbarino also told Fox he noticed 'some parallels' between Frozen and Dante's Inferno. He expressed similar sentiments in a blog post on Reflection and Choice, the official humanities blog for Houston Baptist University. Garbarino compares Elsa's magical creation of a frozen palace, as well as her declaration of freedom in the song 'Let It Go,' with Satan's icy lair in Dante's text. 'Except, is Elsa really free?' he writes. 'She’s trapped herself in an ice palace, and she’s all alone. She’s not free. By indulging her gift, she’s imprisoned herself.' He says Frozen's Elsa, pictured, shares parallels with Satan, since both yearn for freedom but are ultimately trapped after using their talents for selfish purposes . Garbarino, pictured, is an associate professor at Houston Baptist University . 'Satan has six great wings, and every time he flaps them, they produce an icy blast that further freezes him in place,' he says. 'His wings were a gift, but since he is trying to use his gift to serve himself rather than God, his wings have become a curse.' Garbarino also writes that the children's film has elements similar to Milton's Paradise Lost. Elsa's fall is 'in a manner consistent with the Western literary tradition’s picture of humanity’s decent into sin,' he writes. 'We call license “freedom,” and it enslaves us. Luckily for Elsa, a redeemer is coming to rescue her instead of leaving her trapped in her frozen hell.'","Collin Garbarino, an assistant professor at Houston Baptist University, says the relationship between characters Elsa and Anna imitate Christ's self-sacrifice for sinners .

"Armed and dangerous: Two pupils a day are having weapons confiscated by police on school premises. (Stock image, picture posed by model) Almost 1,000 schoolchildren have been caught with lethal weapons such as guns, knives, axes and hammers in just three years, it was revealed yesterday. Two pupils a day are having weapons confiscated by police on school premises, including children as young as eight. The results of Freedom of Information requests to the UK’s 52 police forces show that officers confiscated 981 weapons – including handguns, air guns, knuckledusters, crowbars and lead piping from pupils between 2011 and 2013. Eighty of the youngsters were primary school pupils, including an eight-year-old caught carrying a knife. The figures, from an investigation by Sky News, show 329 pupils were charged with a criminal offence after having weapons confiscated. A stun gun, an axe and a cut-throat razor were among the weapons they were carrying. The statistics relate to disclosures by 31 of 52 police forces. Campaigners warned that the true extent of the problem was certain to be much higher since 21 forces failed to supply information. Based on the known statistics, the figure for the whole country could be as high as 1,645. Education Secretary Michael Gove has given teachers tougher powers to enforce discipline including the right to search pupils without consent. But earlier this month researchers from the University of East Anglia, concluded that the Government and schools watchdog Ofsted ‘seriously underestimate’ the extent of poor behaviour. It warned that pressure on schools to keep expulsion rates down meant that levels of indiscipline were often concealed. The figures show that the problem is not confined to major urban centres. Police in Derbyshire and Suffolk recovered significant numbers of weapons from children. And the figure of 981 does not include the UK’s second largest force, West Midlands, which gave a figure – 538 – that included colleges and universities as well as schools. Figures show that officers confiscated 981 weapons - including handguns, air guns, knuckledusters, crowbars and lead piping - from pupils between 2011 and 2013. (Stock image. Picture posed by models) The parents of Luke Walmsley, who was murdered with a knife at school in rural Lincolnshire in 2003, said a culture of violence persisted around the country. Jayne Walmsley, whose son was 14 when he was stabbed during a break in lessons, described the figures as ‘really shocking’. She added: ‘We need to think and educate these kids. It’s got to stop.’ ‘But . sometimes it feels a little bit like you are banging your head on a . brick wall. Especially when schools now won’t admit to the problem . because all they want is more pupils for more money.’ Tragic: Luke Walmsley was stabbed to death outside a classroom in 2003 at Birkbeck Secondary School in North Somercotes, Lincolnshire . The last Labour government announced plans to install airport-style metal detectors in hundreds of schools. But there are concerns the issue has become less high-profile. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, said: ‘These are disturbing figures. They indicate a serious problem which needs to be addressed, including finding out why some pupils feel it is either necessary or appropriate to bring weapons into school.’ Patrick Regan, of the charity XLP, which was founded in response to a school stabbing, warned that youngsters were arming themselves out of fear. ‘It’s crazy that our young people are feeling that scared that they have to carry a weapon,’ he added. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We have given teachers new powers. They can now search pupils without consent, confiscate prohibited items and use force to remove disruptive pupils from the classroom when necessary. ‘We have also given heads the final say on expulsions by removing the right of appeals panels to put pupils back in the classroom.’ A spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: ‘Carrying a weapon of any kind is not an issue for schools to deal with alone. ‘Police and partners will always be willing to work with a school to take appropriate action.’","Pupils charged for carrying weapons such as stun guns, razors and axes .

"Comments: Damian Hinds said the UK lagged behind international competitors . Social mobility in Britain is the worst in the Western world and the gap between rich and poor has become ingrained in children as young as three, MPs conclude today. They quote a study showing that the prospects of half of all children born in the UK can be almost entirely linked to the circumstances of their parents – compared to only 15 per cent of those in Denmark. Differences are also noticeable at a very young age, with toddlers doing far better in vocabulary tests if they grow up in a more affluent household. Controversially, the MPs call for more . intervention in the lives of under-threes. The report also shows that . despite all the money spent to get more teenagers into university, the . access gap between rich and poor has actually widened in recent years. Last . night Tory backbencher Damian Hinds, chairman of the All-Party Group on . Social Mobility, which wrote the report, said: ‘For a long time, we . have lagged behind our international competitors in ensuring all Britons . can realise their potential. ‘To . bridge the gap will require a shared commitment between schools, . universities and firms, government and the voluntary sector. The scale . of the challenge is immense.’ The . report quotes a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and . Development which compared the extent to which children’s prospects are . predictable from parents’ circumstances. In . the UK, the OECD says 50 per cent of children’s prospects are . predictable from the position of their parents – a sign of low social . mobility. This was worse than Italy (48 per cent), the US (47 per cent) and  France (41 per cent). Poverty: Britain's failure means a poor child born in 1970 is less likely to have gone to university than one born in 1958, MPs say (file photo) The prospects of poorer children born in Australia (17 per cent) and Denmark (15 per cent) are much brighter. Britain’s failure means a poor child born in 1970 is less likely to have gone to university than one born in 1958, the MPs say. The report makes it clear the differences become ingrained as young as the age of three. Studies have shown that while only 42 per cent of parents in the poorest fifth of homes read to their children every day, 78 per cent of those in the richest fifth do so. Wealthier parents are also more likely to send their children to bed at a regular time. It has led to richer children being more likely to be deemed ‘ready’ for school at three. Better future: The prospects of poorer children born in Denmark (above) and Australia (below) are much brighter . They also perform much better in vocabulary tests at five. Children from poorer households are more likely to be hyperactive. The MPs called on the Government to consider ways of improving the education of those from poor backgrounds, such as means-testing fees at independent schools to get more poor people into top schools and sending more poor children to summer camps. But it failed to mention either the return of grammar schools or the assisted-places scheme for poorer families, which was abolished by the last Labour government. The MPs’ report concluded that the biggest impact on social mobility was the quality of parenting, whether the home environment was educational and whether the parents had good mental health. It says: ‘A child’s development from zero to three is the point of greatest leverage for social mobility. It is acknowledged that this is difficult territory for policy makers as it relates to parenting as well as what happens in childcare and nursery settings.’ The conclusion will be controversial because it could be used to support greater ‘nanny state’ interference into families. The MPs urged ministers to do more to encourage parents to read to children using techniques similar to the ‘five-a-day’ campaign which encourages people to eat more fruit and veg. The study also found that the gap between rich and poor on university access has widened. In 1981, children from the richest fifth of households were three times more likely than those from the poorest fifth to go to university. By the late 1990s, they were five times more likely to go.",Study shows prospects of half of UK children almost entirely linked to circumstances of parents .

According to the statistics, single or unmarried women account for five out of every six repeat terminations. Around a third of all abortions carried out in England and Wales are repeats. The figures will fuel the debate on whether abortions, which cost the NHS up to £1,000 each, are being sanctioned as more of a lifestyle choice than a medical requirement. In one London borough, half of all abortions are requested by women who have already aborted at least one foetus. In 2010, the latest year for which figures are available, some 189,000 abortions took place. Of these, more than 64,000 terminations were on women who had already aborted a foetus in the past. More than 50,000 of them were single or living with a partner; while around 9,500 were married – with the marital status unknown for the rest. Critics of the current legislation said terminations have become just another form of contraception because of the lack of independent counselling at clinics which leads to women making the choice to have an abortion rather than continue with their pregnancy. Some experts claim the number of . abortions could be reduced if contraception was made more easily . available and sex education was improved. Lack of counselling: Critics say there is not enough independent advice on abortions, resulting in as many as 85 women having eight terminations . Across all age groups, a total of 85 women had an abortion despite having had seven previous terminations. Josephine Quintavalle, of the Pro-Life Alliance, said: ‘The number of repeat abortions is simply extraordinary. ‘Abortion is an unpleasant and harrowing experience for women and to hear it is happening repeatedly makes your hair stand on end. ‘These figures show that sadly, abortion is being seen by many as a form of contraception. 'But is this surprising when we live in a society which says it’s all right to have an abortion once. 'If it’s fine once, why not two, three or four times.’ The statistics showed that repeat abortions were most prevalent in London. Of the 23 primary care trust areas with the highest proportion of repeat abortions, 21 were in London. Croydon had the highest ratio with half of all terminations being carried out on women who had previously had at least one abortion. Almost 100 of the women who came back for at least their second termination were under the age of 20. Of the 950 repeat abortions, 787 were for unmarried women, of whom 545 were under the age of 30. The boroughs of Lewisham, Southwark and Barking & Dagenham all saw 46 per cent of terminations carried out on women who had undergone the procedure in the past. The lowest rate was in Cambridgeshire where just 23 per cent of abortions were on women who had had one before. In total, some 9,564 married women had a repeat abortion in 2010, with more than two thirds of them over the age of 30. Revelations: The figures were revealed in a parliamentary question submitted by Labour health spokesman Diane Abbott . Across England and Wales, married women accounted for 16 per cent of repeat terminations – but there was a wide regional variation. The North West was the area where the highest percentages of repeat abortions were carried out on unmarried women. In Knowsley, Liverpool and Wirral just 5 per cent of repeat terminations were performed on married women. But in Monmouth in Wales, the proportion of married women having a repeat termination jumped to 34 per cent, followed by Harrow on 33 per cent and Hounslow on 31 per cent. Back in 1998, 29 per cent of abortions were repeats – a proportion which has risen to 33 per cent now. A regional breakdown of the figures – revealed in a parliamentary question submitted by Labour health spokesman Diane Abbott – show that by far the most repeat terminations occur in London. There were 19,295 of them in 2010. The North West is next on 7,537; while the West Midlands on 7,190. Figures late last year showed that each abortion costs the NHS an average of £680. It means around £850,000 is spent on repeat abortions every single week in England and Wales. The figures do not include Scotland and Northern Ireland, which means the full UK cost will be around £1million a week. Stuart Cowie, a spokesman for pressure group LIFE, said: ‘These figures show that “no questions asked” abortion on demand trivialises the process so much that it is no longer seen as the last resort. 'We would like to see more counselling offered to women, and more conversations in the classroom about responsibility.’","Some women have returned for as many as nine terminations in their lifetime .

"Newly released cellphone video shows the moment a 6-foot 250-pound man on a rampage was shot dead by police officers when Tasers failed to subdue him. Delray Beach resident Robert Friskney was trying to get into his neighborhood Tuesday night when he saw the entrance blocked off by police who were trying to calm 28-year-old Anesson Joseph. He says Joseph was acting like an animal, even growling, before he lunged at police officers and they shot him with a Taser. Scroll down for video . Killed: New cellphone video shows police shooting dead Anesson Joseph who attack two men and a 10-year-old boy while stark naked and seemingly high on drugs . Bit and run: Authorities in South Florida say deputies shot a naked man after he attacked a retired police officer and bit another man on the face in Delray Beach . Sheriff's deputies said Joseph appeared to be in a 'state of psychosis' and he continued fight so they had no choice but to shoot him. Identified: The assailant has been identified as 28-year-old Anesson Joseph of West Palm Beach . Paramedics tried to treat Joseph at the scene but he continued to resist. He was eventually taken to Delway Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. Prior to the shooting, Joseph had been terrorizing the suburban neighborhood, carrying out random street attacks on two men and a 10-year-old boy. Retired New York police officer Douglas Kozlik, 66, was out on his nightly walk when Joseph came out of nowhere and started chasing him. Kozlik was left badly bruised to the face with scratches on his head but was out of the hospital the next day. Joseph also injured a 10-year-old and 18-year-old Tony Grein. Grein had a box cutter on him and tried to defend himself with the sharp object, but it was no use on the large man who seemed to have 'superhuman strength' according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. Joseph ended up trying to bite off Grein's face. Grein has several bruises and cuts to his face as well as stitches in his ears after the attack, which the victim showed to WPTV. 'He's obviously delirious on something,' Sheriff Bradshaw said. When police got involved they tried to corner Joseph but he wouldn't calm down and they say he took a 'fighting stance' Bitten: 18-year-old victim Tony Grein shows off some of his injuries . Scratched: Grein tried to fend off Joseph with a box cutter but was unsuccessful . That's when a sergeant fired three times, once to the torso and twice on the lower part of the body. Authorities say it wasn't clear whether it was the gunshots or drugs that ultimately killed him. Deputies believe Joseph was on some sort of narcotic. According to Facebook, he is the CEO of Nightlife University Parites & Events. At some point he started fighting an 18-year-old, who defended himself with a box cutter. The man then bit the 18-year-old on the face. 'He's . obviously delirious on something,' Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric . Bradshaw said. 'He is a huge guy. He takes a fighting stance. They're . trying to get him on the ground. He starts charging them. The Taser did . not affect him.'

"Battle: Education Secretary Michael Gove is considering new anti-strike laws as he moves on to a 'war footing' with the teaching unions . Michael Gove is considering new anti-strike laws as he moves onto a ‘war footing’ with teaching unions who are expected to launch industrial action over the end of national pay deals. Under the reforms announced last week, teachers’ annual rises of around £2,000 will be scrapped and head teachers given almost complete freedom to dictate salary increases based on performance in the classroom. The Education Secretary believes the reform, allowing heads to reward the best teachers and freeze the pay of the least effective, would improve state education and make teaching a more attractive career choice for high-fliers. But union barons have raised the prospect of industrial action, swiftly condemning the move as ‘disastrous’ and ‘unfair’ to long-serving staff. A senior source at the Department for Education said the measures under consideration include legislation to make it more difficult to call strikes, challenging strikes in the courts possibly including the European Court of Human Rights, and making it easier for academies to sack sub-standard staff. Tuition: Currently teachers start on a salary of £21,588 and receive a virtually guaranteed eight per cent pay rise annually in their early years (file picture) The source told The Sunday Times: . ‘Gove’s team and officials have been working on this for 18 months. He . regards giving heads the power to pay good teachers more as one of the . fundamental pillars of the new system’. Mr . Gove’s department is said to be moving onto a ‘war footing’ as the . minister made it clear internally that ‘he is prepared for the unions to . have an all-out strike and that there will be no back-tracking'. Ed Miliband (right) is set to wage a war of his own against Chancellor George Osborne’s benefit cuts. The Labour leader is expected to order his party to stand against real-term reductions in income on the poorest Britons - and join a protest led by church leaders and major charities. A senior source close to Mr Miliband told the Observer that the party would ‘come down very hard on people who milk the system’ but would not confuse them with people who are ‘trying to pay the bills and put food on the table’. Almost 60 charities including Oxfam, Barnardo's and Church Action on Poverty warned in a letter that Mr Osborne’s cuts are ‘punitive, unfair, and must not happen’. Mr Osborne said in the mini-budget last week that benefits will rise by only one per cent for the next three years - rather than with inflation. Currently teachers start on a salary of £21,588 and receive a virtually-guaranteed eight per cent pay rise annually in their early years. The figures are set by national pay bargaining and teachers move up the main pay scale according to length of service in the classroom. The system has meant that long-serving but under-performing teachers are paid the same as more capable colleagues. Under proposed reforms, announced by Chancellor George Osborne in last week’s Autumn Statement, head teachers would in theory be able to promote a teacher from a starting salary to the maximum £51,000 in just six months. The move - which will be put out to consultation - strikes at the heart of national pay bargaining and severely weakens the power of teaching unions. Detailed national pay scales for teachers will be ripped up and replaced with three broad pay bands - starting at £21,804, £34,523 and £37,836 for teachers outside London. It follows a report from the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) which recommended more freedom for schools to set pay. National pay arrangements for civil servants, prison officers and NHS staff will continue. New structure: Detailed national pay scales for teachers will be ripped up and replaced with three broad pay bands - starting at £21,804, £34,523 and £37,836 for teachers outside London (file picture) Heads will also be able to withhold the one per cent pay rise due for all public sector workers in 2013/14 and 2014/15. Only those on the lowest salaries will be guaranteed the increase. 'Gove’s team and officials have been working on this for 18 months. He regards giving heads the power to pay good teachers more as one of the fundamental pillars of the new system' Department for Education senior source . The National Union of Teachers claim that the proposals ‘shake our pay arrangements to their foundations’ and will ‘lead to unnecessary conflict between heads and teachers.’ Its leader Christine Blower and Chris Keates of the NASUWT (National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers) are meeting this week to discuss their response to the pay overhaul. They have mandates for full strikes following ballots of their 430,000 members in England. Miss Blower said strike action ‘remains an option but it will be a last resort.’ The Department for Education source added: ‘A full national strike is regarded as a price worth paying to change the culture and break the destructive power of Keates and Blower. Resources are being moved internally to prepare for strikes. Lawyers are being discreetly spoken to.'","Reforms mean .

"Steven Gerrard was diplomacy personified after his final Premier League derby, even saying he would miss playing at Goodison Park. On the evidence of last night's game, it shouldn't take him more than a couple of weeks of California sunshine to get over any pangs of nostalgia. Just over a year ago, Liverpool and Everton were both in the top-five when they clashed at Goodison and produced a thrilling 3-3 draw that was a candidate for match of the season. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (left) watches on as his acrobatic effort is blocked in their 0-0 draw with local rivals Everton . Gerrard (left) was making his 33rd and final appearance in the Merseyside derby on Saturday evening at Goodison Park .

Subs not used: Ward, Johnson, Lovren, Markovic . Booked: Henderson . Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire) Star man: Jordon Ibe . CLICK HERE for all the stats and heat maps - including Steven Gerrard's (above) - from Goodison Park . Since then, both clubs have gone a little off the boil, or a lot off the boil in Everton's case, and this game reflected that. There was plenty of running, desire and defensive organisation but little in the way of thrills and creativity. The exceptions were Gerrard who twice came close to scoring a fairytale winner and, at the other end of the age scale, 19-year-old winger Jordon Ibe who struck the post in the first half. As for Everton, for a home side to wait until the 86th minute to register a shot on target in a derby is almost unthinkable. No wonder Roberto Martinez, whose glass is always half full, preferred to concentrate on a clean sheet that made it six games unbeaten, though they remain stuck in mid-table for the time being. Rodgers was upbeat afterwards after his gamble on giving Ibe only his second start in a red shirt paid off. Fit-again striker Daniel Sturridge (centre) was named among the Liverpool substitutes for Saturday's evening Merseyside derby .

Ibe was joined in attack by Reds regular Raheem Sterling (right) - who is pictured running at Everton captain Phil Jagielka during the game . Gerrard (left) came close to giving his side a dream start but saw his free-kick tipped over by Everton goalkeeper Joel Robles . The youngster came closest to breaking the deadlock when he ran past two Everton defenders before planting a 25-yard shot against the upright. 'I thought it would creep in,' he admitted shyly after collecting his man-of-the-match award. Rodgers was more effusive. 'I thought over the course of the game we were clearly the better team, he said. 'The balance was very good. We pressed, we looked exiting and were a threat going forward. We switched off in the last five minutes and they had a counter attack but that was their first shot on target. 'I had been waiting to bring Jordon into the team. We felt he could contribute, it is why we brought him back from loan at Derby and I had no qualms about putting him in for this game.' So often has Gerrard written his own scripts – not least against Everton with 10 goals in 32 previous derbies – it was almost a surprise when his first-half free-kick was clawed away by Joel Robles, and when an acrobatic overhead kick cannoned off the head of Steven Naismith and went wide. Typically, he preferred to concentrate on Ibe afterwards rather than wallow in his own farewell. 'It was a sensational performance, he only knew on Friday he'd be playing,' said Gerrard. 'He was man of the match.' Merseyside Police weren't happy with the 5.30pm kick off time but it meant the floodlights were on at the start and added to a crackling atmosphere. The first contentious decision, a Naismith barge on Mamadou Sakho, was met with a cacophony of howls and we seemed all set for rip-roaring contest. Unfortunately, it became clear fairly quickly that neither team feel confident enough at the moment to take their foot off the pedal and go for it. Everton were happy to see their midfield “dog of war” James McCarthy back after six weeks absence and built their team around him. Liverpool looked a more cohesive unit with Sterling and Coutinho pinging first-time passes around but the Gerrard free-kick apart, they had little to show for it in front of goal. Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho (right) tries to evade the challenge of Everton midfielder James McCarthy . Liverpool were dealt with an early blow when midfielder Lucas Leiva (right) pulled up with an injury . As a manager, Martinez loved it and he and Rodgers were constantly issuing instructions to their players. 'Tactically it was fascinating, with two asymetric shapes,' said the Everton boss. Unfortunately for everyone else, there wasn't enough going on in the penalty areas to make it exciting. Liverpool kept Romelu Lukaku quiet with defender Emre Can described as a “Rolls Royce” by Rodgers. When Daniel Sturridge came on for Liverpool after 55 minutes, he didn't get a real sniff of goal. There wasn't even much genuine aggro flying about. Jordan Henderson and Naismith were booked for dishing out verbals to each other late on and Kevin Mirallas stormed away after being substituted but it was handbags stuff. Lucas (left) had to be helped off the pitch as he couldn't continue playing Saturday's Premier League encounter . Perhaps there weren't enough Scousers on the pitch who knew how much the fixture meant; just Gerrard until Rickie Lambert and Ross Barkley came on as late substitutes. Everton's local left-back Leighton Baines has an injured knee. Gerrard tried a scissors kick that was goalbound til it hit Naismith and then at the end, Everton belatedly had a late flurry. Barkley played in Coleman and his rising shot produced a flying save by Mignolet. A point for Liverpool keeps them four points off a Champions League spot. Everton's only chance of qualifying for Europe rests with winning the Europa League, a competition where they could meet their Merseyside rivals again. Meanwhile, Gerrard's farewell tour continues before he hits Los Angeles Galaxy. With each passing week, he must feel he's made the right decision.

"Midlife thriver, Jane Mathews, author of 'Midlife Manifesto – a tool-kit to plan the rest of your life' offers some practical steps to help navigate and transform the turbulent, exciting years that are a person's midlife into a midlife opportunity. She also gives tips to ensure that a person can live without regrets and appreciate themselves. 'In my forties I bought a fridge magnet that said 'Destined to be a woman with no regrets'. I looked at it. It looked back at me, and we both had an uneasy feeling that were I to continue on my current trajectory, I would have regrets. On the surface, things were fine – nice husband, 2.4 children (with Rory, the farting Airedale Terrier making up the .4), living in Sydney's answer to Wisteria Lane. But my instincts told me that all was not right. Like so many mid-life women, I looked in the mirror and thought, 'Is this it?' Jane Matthews has written a new book to inspire people in their 'midlife' to grasp and create new opportunities . 'Looked promising&.In 1992 ? now my marriage is over, my parents are dead and the house sold. But it?s not all bad news!' writes Jane Matthews . Mid-life can creep up on you or it can hit you in the face. I found myself letting the seatbelt out on the plane a bit longer each time (there must have been a very small child in that seat before me…), seeing a multi-chinned Shar Pei photograph of myself… and then there's the hair thing. Chewbacca on a good day. Hairs growing where they have never ventured before. I am the Bearded Lady! Not that it matters any more, as I seemed to have donned Harry Potter's Invisibility Cloak… . Plus the big things – tectonic plates of relationships shifting (triggering an unanticipated divorce), menopause, the death of my parents, getting back into the workforce at 49 and spiralling blood pressure. The fridge magnet that spurred Ms Matthews to change her life and ensure she really would live life to the fullest . Plus teaching a child to drive! I tried to find a book to help, but they were uniformly po-faced, badly written and all from an American perspective. No good to me. So I wrote it myself, and 'Midlife Manifesto' was born. Mid-life offers a wonderful chance to decide what you want to do with the rest of your life. After decades of looking after other people, finally we get to put the oxygen mask on first. And how sweet that is. Ban 'middle age' and 'midlife crisis' from your vocabulary and think 'mid-life opportunity'. You write your own story and you hold the pen. 'Ban 'middle age' and 'midlife crisis' from your vocabulary and think 'mid-life opportunity' A 5 point mid-life action plan . 1. Work out exactly where you want your life to lead . What is your vision? Don't be a piece of flotsam, drifting aimlessly along, saying 'I don't know where the time goes'. Decide what you . really want to do with your life, who you want to be, how you want to live, and consciously work towards it. There are lots of different ways to help you identify your vision: Imagine your perfect day or produce a kick ass vision board. Or write your own eulogy, or your future life in six words, or just jot down a good old bucket list. It will be very clear where your heart is telling you to go. You should be smiling with anticipation. 'There are lots of different ways to help you identify your vision: Imagine your perfect day or produce a kick ass vision board' 2. Write your own Midlife Manifesto – your life plan . Writing my own Midlife Manifesto has had a profound impact on my life. I feel more in control, and happy that I'm pointing my life in a particular direction. Now it's your turn. It is amazing how many lists women write - shopping lists,'to do' lists and Christmas present lists, but so few of us actually put time aside to write a Life Plan. To begin with, think of the areas that are most important to you. Now consider each aspect really carefully. Get inspired. Research. Read. Google yourself senseless. Write down what you want to achieve in area of your life, and how you intend to get there. The three cornerstones to every woman's Midlife Manifesto should be your body, relationships and finances: . Jane Matthews (pictured centre with friends) says it is crucial to make sure you cherish your friends as they are 'the most important contributor to a happy old age' 3. My body – finally growing to love it . For the first half of our lives (which are largely lived on 'automatic') most of us took our health for granted. Now it's time to switch to manual and be proactive about our health. Instead of disliking and finding fault with my body, I try to think of it (her!) as a wise and supportive friend. If you look after your body, she will look after you in years to come, and really, you know your body well enough to know what it will respond to best. Predictably, but sensibly, it boils down to exercise and food. I like what Dr Phil says about exercise: 'You don't have to want to do it, you just have to do it'. Put it in your diary and getting up earlier! As for food, the guidelines are clear and I'm not going to patronise you by repeating them. It's about choices. You send your body a message whether you care for it or not. Jane Matthews, pictured with her son and daughter, says 'one of the most important jobs we can do as parents is give our children memories for when they are older' 4. Work on your relationships . Family and friends are the most important contributor to a happy old age, but are you really investing in, and building that support framework now? Like the elastic in your knickers, so don't appreciate it until it's goneFriends are precious and are like gardens – they need watering and fertilizing – and weeding too! Inevitably in midlife, marriages evolve. Don't sit by and watch as your lives become parallel train tracks. Consciously work on merging them and keeping them that way. If your parents are alive, you are lucky. Tell them how much you love them, record their voices and their stories (and them telling you they love you) and make sure your children get to know them. As for children themselves, one of the most important jobs we can do as parents is give our children memories for when they are older…And love yourself first… . Your relationship with yourself is the most important relationship in your lives, yet curiously one that we only begin to examine and explore in midlife. I have learned that you have to be your own best friend. Happiness is like a dodgy bank heist – it's an inside job. 'I have learned that you have to be your own best friend. Happiness is like a dodgy bank heist – it's an inside job,' writes Ms Matthews . 5. Be Financially Independent (A man is not a financial plan!) Step being ostrich woman with your head in the sand! I am staggered by the number of women who crackle with intelligence but have no clue about their financial situation. You must be the ruler of your own financial destiny, whether you are in a relationship or not. A full life is ready and waiting for all of us. But you have to go to it – it won't come to you. Define where you want to go, point your arrow, let it go and engage with life. And always, always trust your instincts. Roar!

"She once dismissed the idea of a ‘Strictly Come Dancing curse’, despite several competitors ending their relationships after falling for their dance partners. However, it seems Rachel Riley has now joined their ranks after starting a relationship with the professional dancer she partnered on the BBC show last year. Russian-born Pasha Kovalev, 34, confirmed that he has been seeing the 28-year-old – best-known as the resident maths genius on Channel 4 quiz Countdown – since early summer. Scroll down for video . Rachel Riley and Pasha Kovalev in London: A Strictly source said: 'They always had a natural chemistry' Head over heels: Rachel Riley's Strictly Come Dancing partner Pasha Kovalev has confirmed they started dating this year following her split from husband Jamie Gilbert . He said they started their . relationship after Miss Riley split with her husband Jamie Gilbert, whom . she met while at Oxford University. Yesterday . pictures were published of Miss Riley and Mr Kovalev strolling and . chatting before going into Miss Riley’s £600,000 home in West London. They later left separately.’ When . Mr Kovalev was asked if their relationship had started in early summer, . after her marriage ended, he told The Sun: ‘That’s what happened. He added: ‘I don’t want to make any personal comment. I would like people to focus on the show. It’s going to be brilliant.’ Stepping out: Rachel and Pasha chatted contently as they headed to the Countdown star's £600,000 home in London . Confirmation: Dancer Pasha has revealed that he started dating Rachel after the breakdown of her marriage . Serious chat: The pair looked deep in conversation as they entered Rachel's home . Coincidence? The pair were spotted together just hours before Pasha was paired up with Caroline Flack on the launch of this year's Strictly Come Dancing . As . luck would have it, the pictures appeared only hours before the opening . episode of the latest series of Strictly was broadcast on BBC1 last . night. Mr Kovalev, who this . year will partner broadcaster Caroline Flack, and Miss Riley were the . source of much speculation when they danced together on Strictly. A . source close to the show said: ‘Pasha and Rachel always had a natural . chemistry. You could see that they had a soft spot for each other when . they were on the show. Glowing: Rachel looked happier than ever as she attended Pup Aid in Primrose Hill on Saturday . Dance diva: Rachel, seen here with Pasha, left Strictly Come Dancing after six weeks in the competition but their chemistry was hard to ignore . ‘When . Rachel separated from her husband we suspected something would happen . between the two of them and it was always a case of when, not if.’ Another . source close to the dancers said: ‘Rachel and Pasha kept in touch . post-Strictly and he became a shoulder for her to cry on as her marriage . broke down. ‘Her career . has not progressed as she would have liked and no doubt having Pasha on . her arm will help to raise her profile again now the series has . started.’ Miss Riley met Mr . Gilbert at  the age of 19 when both were  students. Their marriage . lasted only 16 months before they split – her heavy work schedule was . blamed and she said no one else was involved. Speaking . about Strictly, she told the Daily Telegraph this year: ‘It’s tough on a . relationship because it’s so full-on and all-absorbing yet it’s . something your real-life partner can’t be a part of. I don’t think . there’s a Strictly curse, but it does serve as a magnifying glass that . shows up pre-existing fault lines.’ In . 2007, dancer Flavia Cacace got together with show partner Matt Di . Angelo, ending her romance with Vincent Simone. The next year Mr Simone . admitted cheating on his pregnant girlfriend with dancer Kristina . Rihanoff.

"Downton Abbey may still be grieving the recent loss of Lord Grantham’s beloved pet labrador Isis. But at Highclere Castle, real-life setting for the ITV drama, the lady of the house can still turn to her loyal dogs for protection from ghosts and ghouls. The Countess of Carnarvon relied on her own six hounds to safeguard her on Halloween night from the spirits that haunt her home, she has revealed in her blog, alongside a photograph of her canine guard of honour. Scroll down for video . Lady Carnarvon, pictured, along with her dog Percy in Highclere Castle, home to TV's Downton Abbey . Hugh Bonneville, who plays Lord Grantham, is concerned about the health of his faithful dog Isis, pictured . She wrote: ‘I decided to let all six dogs sleep with me in my bedroom on Halloween night since my husband, Geordie, was away. ‘The dogs were all quite thrilled as we made our way along the corridors. ‘They had no idea about my superstitious date but as I drew the curtains, they happily sprawled out.’ Hours earlier, the Countess had deeply unsettled herself by recalling stories of past ghostly goings on at Highclere. She wrote: ‘I ended up swapping ghost stories with Pat, our decorator, who was telling me about the passage and stairs where she and her father saw a ghost (a woman) and the heavy doors that, although shut, swing open. ‘Most of the staff have a story or two. Diana, our head housekeeper, has spotted a few spooky goings on and John, our castle manager, regularly hears footsteps walking along a corridor when locking up at night.’ She added: ‘My husband is quite unaffected and pragmatic, but does inquire every so often if we need another priest or whether we are managing. He will not have six dogs upstairs.’ Lady Carnarvon said that her dogs, pictured,  keep the ghosts away from her Highclere castle home . Downton’s millions of loyal viewers should be braced for the ITV series to take a supernatural turn if Lady Carnarvon has any influence on the show’s creator Lord Fellowes. She wrote: ‘Julian Fellowes has not yet introduced ghosts in Downton Abbey – we have had deaths, murders, suicides and plenty of illness. Perhaps this time next year?’ The Countess admits, however, that the dogs were perhaps not the most reliable of guards. She wrote: ‘During the night, they turned and got up, whimpering as they presumably dreamt of happy games of tag, and leaping into ponds. ‘I did not sleep particularly well and had just drifted off when Scooby-Doo (who is well named) decided to leap on top of the bed, wanting an immediate cuddle.’","Lady Carnarvon said her dogs keep the ghosts away from Highclere Castle .

"A Florida school board may change a policy allowing groups to distribute religious materials in high schools after a satanic worship group has asked to distribute coloring books about their faith. The board discussed changing their current policy during a workshop on Thursday but the earliest it could vote to change would be late January or early February, said officials. A spokesperson for The Satanic Temple says that they should be able to hand out coloring books that feature children performing satanic rituals and drawing pentagrams just like any other religious group. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Pamphlet: A satanic worship group has asked to be able to distribute this coloring book to high schoolers . Policy change: The Florida school board met on Thursday to discuss changing their distribution policies . 'It strongly implies they never intended to have a plurality of voices,' said Doug Mesner, co-founder and spokesman for The Satanic Temple, who also goes by the name Lucien Greaves. The content in the coloring books are puzzles that ask children to search for words like, empathy, love, care, and friendship. Another typical page of the coloring book shows a young girl named Annabel who is 'spreading knowledge and helping to dispel fear and ignorance by demonstrating her satanic ritual for her class.' The satanic group is not the only one that hands out materials, either. An evangelical group called World Changers of Florida has given out Bibles in Orange schools three times, reports WPTV. District counsel Woody Rodriguez said that the satanic group is the only one that submitted a request but that the evangelical group said they will hand out their material as well. Cartoons: Each page of the coloring book aims at teaching people the truth about satanic worship that believers feel are misconstrued . Evil?: The book contains activities in which students are asked to find words like love and care . 'They seem to be moving against the interests of a large part of the community,' said World Changers of Florida Greg Harper of the Static Temple's Desire to hand out material. 'The Bible will open somebody's heart, somebody's mind, and cause them to pursue answers.' Board Member Christine Moore said that people are having trouble with a policy change on Christian groups. 'Everyone's upset about the Satanists and the atheists coming,' she said. An atheist groups saw the upside of the potential policy change and has given out atheist materials in the past in opposition to Bible distributions. 'It's a bit of a relief,' said David Williamson of the Central Florida Freethought Community. 'Given that there's a potential change in the policy, we won't be allowing distribution,' Rodriguez said. 'We're going to wait.'","The Satanic Temple, a worship group, has asked to distribute a coloring book to Florida high schoolers .

"Shake-up: A review ordered by Education Secretary Michael Gove (above) says children should be made to study history and geography to improve standards . Pupils may be forced to study history and geography until they are 16 under plans for a shake-up of the national curriculum. An independent review ordered by Education Secretary Michael Gove called for the move yesterday as part of a wider drive to address concerns that England’s schools are falling behind the rest of the world. A separate report yesterday warned of a sharp decline in history teaching, with 159 schools not entering a single pupil for a GCSE in the subject last year. Recent studies have exposed a shocking ignorance about history among school-leavers. One found that half of all 18 to 24-year-olds did not know Nelson led the British to victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, with a similar  proportion unaware that the Romans built Hadrian’s Wall. Under the proposals, all pupils in England would be required to study history, geography, a foreign language, design and technology and the arts until at least 16, even if they are not planning to take a GCSE in them. At present pupils can drop these subjects at 14. An expert panel appointed by Mr Gove found that the curriculum in England narrows earlier than in countries with more successful education systems, where pupils are required to study key subjects such as history for longer. As a result, many youngsters are ‘deprived of access to powerful forms of knowledge and experience at a formative time in their lives’, the panel said. Gaps in knowledge: Under the proposals, teenagers would have to study history, geography, a foreign language, design and technology and the arts until at least 16 even if they don't sit the GCSE . A move to make these subjects compulsory would tie in with the Government’s new English Baccalaureate, awarded to pupils who gain at least five Cs at GCSE in English, maths, science, history or geography and a foreign language. Tory MP Chris Skidmore, vice-chairman of the all-party history group, warned that the decline in history teaching had potentially far-reaching consequences. Mr Skidmore, who will use a Commons debate today to call for history to be made compulsory, said: ‘At the moment we are the only country in Europe, apart from Albania, that allows children to finish history at 14. Warning: MP Richard Skidmore will use a commons debate today to call for history to be made compulsory . ‘There are dozens of schools where not a single pupil is studying history beyond that point. ‘Yet history is a subject that binds us as a nation. Having a common understanding of the past helps us to create a more coherent and tolerant society.’ Mr Skidmore said the subject was becoming increasingly confined to the most academic schools, particularly in the south. Yesterday’s proposals are part of wider reforms designed to boost England’s competitiveness by improving the curriculum. Other suggestions include requiring children to learn their times tables at a younger age. n Scruffy teachers should be ordered to smarten up, the incoming head of Ofsted  said yesterday. Sir Michael Wilshaw said teachers should set an example and dress in a ‘professional’ manner. He added: ‘I think it’s patronising to children for staff to dress poorly.’","Aims to address fears that standards are falling behind rest of the world .

Dolores Thompson developed a fatal infection after she 'lacerated her right leg on a metal shelving unit when attempting to evade boxes' at Kmart . NBC Chicago reports the accident took place at a Kmart on 11 Northpoint Dr., south of Joliet, which has since been shuttered. One month later she was diagnosed with an methicillin resistant staph aureus infection in her leg. In April, she died of related sepsis in Cook County. According to her obituary, the 88-year-old Thompson left behind one grandson, and was a homemaker for most of her life. A representative for the company said it has yet to see the suit and cannot comment on it . Thompson is seeking $200,000 in damaged plus court costs with the four-count wrongful death suit.

"A suburban Chicago hospital has come under severe scrutiny after a very rare strain of a dangerous drug resistant strand of flu was found to be connected to a series of operations performed there. The Centers for Disease Control has discovered 44 cases where patients in Illinois had a particular bacteria and 38 of those individuals had all recently undergone an endoscopic procedure at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in the past year. The bacteria, carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE), is extremely difficult to treat because it has unusually high levels of tolerance to antibiotics. Dangerous hub: Advocate Lutheran General Hospital is the site where 38 cases of the bacterial outbreak stemmed from but investigators still haven't been able to determine what caused the spread . The fact that the outbreak has only occurred in people who have recently undergone surgery comes as little surprise since the CDC website states 'healthy people usually do not get CRE infections'. CRE is most regularly seen as a mutant form of a urinary tract infection that, if it spreads to the patient's bloodstream, has a 40 to 50 per cent chance of being fatal. The question that investigators are facing now, however, is why this particular hospital is causing the spread of the rare bacteria. While CRE can be found in any number of patients who were reliant upon breathing machines or catheters, they have limited the field down slightly within those infected at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital. CBS Chicago reports that the patients who face the most immediate risk are those who had an endoscopic procedure on their pancreas or bile ducts between January and September of 2013. 'It’s the largest outbreak that we’ve seen in the U.S. of this bacteria ever,' infectious disease doctor and investigation supervisor Alex Kallen said. 'This is a huge cluster,' he told The Wall Street Journal. Fatal: When the carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) gets into a patients bloodstream, it is fatal 40 to 50 per cent of the time . Since the outbreak was spotted, 243 patients have been tested at the hospital and most of them had traces of exposure to the bug- which is called being 'colonized'- and it had lived in their digestive tract but it did not progress into the disease form, meaning that they were fine. CBS Chicago says that 28 of the tested patients had traces of the organism but did not have an infection. Ten other patients had worse luck as they had traces of the organism but also had signs of infection and symptoms of the disease. The current status of those patients has not been released but the hospital said that a small percentage had been treated by antibiotics against, defeating the bug's high resistance levels. Hospital officials first noticed a problem six months ago after seven patients came back and were found to have CRE infections. The CDC then became involved in the issue and while they did not find anything wrong with the sterilization techniques used by the hospital, they took pre-emptive measures. 'To ensure no other patients are at risk, we have moved to gas sterilization for these particular scopes, which exceeds the manufacturer’s recommended cleaning and disinfectant guidelines,' Leo Kelly, Vice President of Medical Management at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital told CBS.","44 infections have been confirmed in Northeaster Illinois, 38 of which come from the same hospital in Park Ridge .
The bacteria- carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae- is rarely treatable using antibiotics because it has extremely high resistance levels .
If the bacteria gets in a patient's bloodstream, there is up to a 50 per cent chance that it will be fatal .
'Healthy people don't get' the bacteria which is almost always traced to hospitals and patients who have undergone endoscopic procedures ."
"Didi Hamann will be forever associated with the Champions League after his part in Liverpool’s legendary win against AC Milan in the 2005 final. Hamann came on as a half-time substitute with Liverpool trailing 3-0 and is credited with helping their remarkable comeback as Rafa Benitez’s side fought back to draw 3-3 and win on penalties. With the 2015 Champions League knockout stages due to begin this week, Hamann — also a German World Cup finalist in 2002 — casts his eye over all the ties with reporter Joe Bernstein.

PARIS ST GERMAIN v CHELSEA . Tues, Feb 17 7.45pm, ITV1 . Jose Mourinho and Chelsea know what the Champions League is all about. Mourinho has won it with Porto and Inter and Chelsea lifted the trophy three years ago. They know what it takes get a result in Paris and finish the job off at Stamford Bridge. I am yet to be convinced by PSG, it takes more than buying quality players to win the Champions League and they are not proven at this level. It’s amazing that Zlatan Ibrahimovic hasn’t won the competition and David Luiz will be the centre of attention against his former club. Winners: Chelsea . The Champions League is one of the few trophies that has so far eluded PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic . SHAKHTAR DONETSK v BAYERN  MUNICH . Tues, Feb 17 7.45pm, Sky Sports 1 . This tie would have been hard enough for Shakhtar anyway but it has been made even tougher by having to play their home leg in Lviv because of the troubles in Donetsk. However, Bayern have won only one in five matches in Ukraine. I expect Arjen Robben to be the key. He has been the top scorer in Munich for the past 18 months, Robert Lewandowski hasn’t hit the ground running after his move from Dortmund and Franck Ribery’s injuries have limited his playing time. Winners: Bayern Munich . In-form Arjen Robben (left) holds the key to Bayern Munich's success in the Champions League . SCHALKE v REAL MADRID . Weds, Feb 18 7.45pm, Sky Sports 5 . Gareth Bale scored twice at Schalke last season when Real Madrid won 6-1. I find it strange he isn’t loved by Real fans because I don’t think he could have done more for them. Schalke have done well since the mid-winter break and will fancy their chances at home, particularly after signing Matija Nastasic on loan. He’s a good defender and I was surprised he didn’t feature more at Man City. Schalke manager Roberto di Matteo knows how to cause a Champions League shock but even so the holders have so much quality. Winners: Real Madrid . It is incredible that Real Madrid fans have criticised Gareth Bale at the Bernabeu this season . BASEL v PORTO . Wed, Feb 18 7.45pm, Sky Sports 1 . I was impressed by Basel when I saw them knock out Liverpool in the group stages. They have some good young players — defender Fabian Schar is outstanding, Fabian Frei is a proper midfielder and Marco Streller is still doing a job at 33. Porto are opponents that won’t suit them. They have a lot of power in their team and, with goalscorer Jackson Martinez, they might be too powerful. Winners: Porto . Porto forward Jackson Martinez could pack too much power for surprise package Basel . JUVENTUS v BORUSSIA DORTMUND . Tues, Feb 24 7.45pm, Sky Sports 1 . A fascinating tie. I fancied Dortmund when the draw was made but have changed my mind as they are struggling in the Bundesliga, while Juventus are dominating Serie A and have some great players, such as Carlos Tevez, Andrea Pirlo and Paul Pogba. Dortmund have saved their best for Europe but recently their priority has been the league because of the relegation danger. Too many players have been out of form. Winners: Juventus . Paul Pogba (centre) will be hoping Juventus' domestic domination can extend into Europe . MANCHESTER CITY v BARCELONA . Tues, Feb 24 7.45pm, ITV 1 . Barcelona have started to fire while City have been so inconsistent, drawing 1-1 at home to Hull and then winning 4-1 at Stoke. City will take heart from last season, when they took Barcelona to the wire at the Nou Camp. But Barca have so much European experience on their side. It will be Luis Suarez’s first game in England since he left Liverpool and he has found it difficult in Spain. He was the boss at Liverpool and that suited him, whereas that is not the case at Barca. It hasn’t really worked out for him and there is every chance he will leave this summer. Winners: Barcelona . Luis Suarez (centre) will be playing in his first game back in England since leaving Liverpool for Barcelona . ARSENAL v MONACO . Weds, Feb 25 7.45pm, Sky Sports 5 . I expect big things from Arsenal, they are capable of beating any team on their day. If only they’d break the bank for someone like Morgan Schneiderlin from Southampton and they would be serial trophy winners. A lot of people would like to see Arsene Wenger have a proper run in this year’s competition and they have the best possible draw. Although Monaco did well to win their group, they are not the team that spent big money on James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao. If Arsenal have anything about them, they have to get through this game. Mesut Ozil is key and can turn matches like this. Winners: Arsenal . Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil's sublime skills are tailormade for the Champions League stage . BAYER LEVERKUSEN v ATLETICO MADRID . Wed, Feb 25 7.45pm, Sky Sports 1 . Atletico were so close in the final against Real last year. Everyone seemed to think they would fade away this season but it hasn’t happened. I’m impressed at how Diego Simeone has got Fernando Torres going again. Torres has been woeful for three years, and I always felt the only place he could rediscover his form was at Liverpool or Atletico. Leverkusen didn’t start too well after the mid-winter break in Germany but their South Korean star Son Heung-min is now back from the Asian Cup. They have missed him but Atletico are so well-oiled and hard to break down. Winners: Atletico .

"A crisis of confidence among girls studying maths is dragging down their performance at school and stunting their choice of careers, a report has found. Girls are better than boys in most subjects and outperform them in the vast majority of formal exams. But they have so little self-belief in maths that they are up to a term behind boys by their mid-teens and are far more likely to drop it for A-levels. Crisis: The performance of girls in maths is being dragged down by their lack of confidence, a report found (Stock picture) The low expectations are the result of parents and teachers assuming they are better suited to other subjects, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which conducted the research and described its findings as ‘troubling’. The study of 15-year-olds in developed countries revealed 41 per cent of British girls believe they are not good at maths, compared to just 24 per cent of boys. This translates into just ten per cent being high-fliers in the subject at school, compared to 13 per cent of boys. The OECD average is 11 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. The worst-performing girls are around three months behind their counterparts in other OECD countries and a staggering six years adrift of top students in world leader Shanghai. Self-belief: 41 per cent of British girls believe they are not good at maths, compared to just 24 per cent of boys, according to research (Stock picture) The gender gap in teenagers planning to continue studying maths when they leave school is 14 per cent in the UK - 60 per cent of boys and 46 per cent of girls - compared to an average of 12 per cent in developed countries. And girls rule themselves out of some of the most lucrative jobs because of their dislike for the subject. Only 40 per cent would consider a job that ‘requires considerable use of mathematics’ over one that is science-based, while for boys it is 50 per cent. Even if they choose science-heavy jobs, they tend to opt for those with little maths, such as health and social fields. Boys show a preference to be engineers or computer scientists. The study suggested there is no genetic reason for the difference between the sexes in the UK. There is no gender gap in 23 of the 65 countries or major economic regions studied and girls outperform boys in several countries including Iceland and Malaysia. The data comes from further analysis of the OECD’s 2012 PISA survey (Programme for International Student Assessment), which last month revealed British teenagers have dropped out of the top 20 rankings in maths, science and reading for the first time. Pupils in Vietnam, Shanghai and Poland now have a better understanding of all three core subjects. Another report from the organisation in October found the UK was the only country where young people were worse at maths and reading than those approaching retirement, despite years of rising exam grades. The latest research said there had been no improvement in closing the gap in maths between boys and girls since 2003. Let down: Education minister Elizabeth Truss said girls had been let down by 'outdated assumptions about what they are good at' (Stock picture) The authors said: ‘More troubling still is the fact that the gender gap extends to students’ attitudes towards learning mathematics, which has repercussions in life well beyond school. ‘Shrinking the gender gap in mathematics performance will require the concerted effort of parents, teachers and society as a whole to change the stereotyped notions of what boys and girls excel at, what they enjoy doing and what they believe they can achieve.’ Recommendations to ‘change the mindset’ include making the subject more interesting to girls and eliminating stereotypes in textbooks. Education minister Elizabeth Truss said girls had been let down by ‘outdated assumptions about what they are good at’. She added: ‘This government’s reforms are fixing the problem. Thanks to the new Ebacc measure [of core subjects including English, maths and science to check a school’s performance], the number of girls doing GCSE physics is at record levels, while girls’ A-level entries for chemistry and maths are at their highest ever levels.’","Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development studied 15-year-olds .

"They are scenes of extraordinary tenderness – and trust. The first photograph  shows the controversial moment that a father allowed his 18-month-old daughter to play with a 300lb gorilla. And the experience seems to have taught the little girl, Tansy Aspinall, a lesson in confidence and courage. Scroll down for video .

The next picture also shows Tansy, now grown up, and yet again putting her trust in the arms of a massive male primate. This time, though, the embrace is the result of a truly touching reunion. Tansy is the eldest daughter of maverick conservationist Damian Aspinall, and the gorilla she is cuddling is Djalta, one of the animals she played with as a child at Aspinall’s Howlett Wild Animal Park in Kent. During their embrace they rub noses, share kisses and sniff each other in a deep animal ritual. The bond is clearly strong – and made even more remarkable by the fact that this was the first time they’d seen each other for 12 years, after Djalta was returned to the wild in 2002. The reunion, film of which can be watched on MailOnline, took place four months ago in the rain forest of Gabon when father and daughter journeyed in a small boat up a river deep into the jungle, on what seemed like an impossible mission to find Djalta and another gorilla, Bims, who also used to live at the animal park. Remarkably, after Tansy and her father had been searching for just a few hours in the tropical heat, they spotted two familiar faces peering quizzically from the dense forest. And, despite not having seen their human friends for many years, the now fully grown male apes emerged to enthusiastically embrace them. Old friends: Djalta wanders out of undergrowth to check on the visitors in the boat on the river . Is it you? After greeting Damian Aspinall, Djalta rubs and sniffs Tansy in a bonding ritual . Tansy, now 25 and a jewellery designer, has no recollection of her first close encounter with a gorilla, when her father put her into the gorilla pen and captured the moment on camera. The video caused a huge public outcry when he at last released it publicly two years ago. Tansy does, however, vividly remember playing with Djalta and Bims, and the trip to the vast reserve in Gabon that her father’s foundation runs was, she says, like a happy family reunion. She recalls: ‘My sister Clary and I often played with Djalta and Bims on the lawn and sometimes we went into the cages with other gorillas. I loved being around them all, but those two guys were really very special to us, like our relatives. ‘I last saw them when I was ten and they were being crated up for the trip to the conservation site in Gabon. ‘When we set out to find them again I was a little apprehensive at first because I didn’t know if they would remember me after all that time, or if they had become hardened by life and possibly dangerous. ‘So, it was amazing to see that not only did they know me, but they had such gentle looks on their faces that I felt immediately safe and reassured. At no point did I feel fear. They had some rough and tumble with dad, but were really very gentle with me. ‘Dad greeted them first and made sure it was safe before I got close. He would never let me near an overly aggressive gorilla.’ Sitting in the elegant surroundings of her father’s headquarters in Belgravia, she certainly shows no signs of any adverse effects from the encounter. This is not entirely surprising, given that her grandfather was the legendary gambler and maverick zoo keeper John Aspinall, who collected exotic pets and passed on his all-consuming passion for wildlife. He insisted that his keepers should interact closely with all his animals – a contentious policy that saw five of them killed during the 1980s and 1990s. And it was a tradition, Tansy says, for family members to meet and interact with the gorillas. Hug: Tansy and the gorilla enjoy a warm embrace as the pair reacquaint themselves with each other . Shared passion: Tansy and her father Damian, 54, have a shared love for wild animals and have devoted time to saving endangered species . Damian’s childhood playmates included tigers, wolves and gorillas, and he has taken on the work started by his father with zeal. The 54-year-old millionaire casino-owner, once a regular on the international party circuit, has devoted his life and considerable fortune to saving endangered species. He has run Howletts and Port Lympne wildlife parks in Kent as well as the Aspinall Foundation, since his father’s death in 2000, and has just published a book charting the foundation’s 30 years of work, to celebrate the landmark occasion. He is understandably proud that for the past 15 years the charity has done more than any other organisation to breed animals threatened with extinction – especially gorillas – and return them back into the wild . He says: ‘We have sent bison to Romania, hyenas to South Africa, gibbons to Indonesia and even wild horses back to Mongolia. A few days ago we released eight Javan langurs into the wild of Indonesia. We are the only organisation in the world doing this and fills me with pride.’ Like his father, who made his fortune from his Mayfair casinos and spent it on creating country estates for his wild animals, Damian uses the profits of his property and gambling empire to keep his charity afloat, as well as funding the patrolling of the foundation’s conservancies in Africa, which span about 1 million acres. He employs 24-hour armed guards to protect the animals and his staff from poachers, along with vets, whisperers and naturalists to nurture and teach the gorillas, rhinos and monkeys how to live in the wild as they make the transition to freedom. Although his maverick style of conservation has long been looked on with suspicion by the zoological establishment, there is no questioning the success of his methods. They include giving his animals the freshest fruit and vegetables, Sunday roasts and even chocolates on special occasions. Good old days: Baby Tansy with her mother Louise and one of the gorillas at the zoo in Kent . But, Damian insists, what makes his foundation the best at what it does, is the fact that the animals are treated as equals. ‘We love them and recognise that they have as much right to be here as humans. We spend £10,000 a week buying the best fruit and vegetables from Covent Garden. Why should they get second rate food – we don’t.’ Of course, he has not made friends in the establishment with his criticism of conventional zoos and what he calls ‘their barbaric ethos’. He would like them phased out, ‘with a few exceptions,’ over the next 30 years. ‘It’s like locking children up - it’s deeply unethical,’ he insists. Since its inception, the charity has enjoyed unprecedented breeding and reintroduction successes with gorillas, with over 130 births and over 80 of the animals released back into the wild – more than any other organisation in the world. There have been disappointments too; a family of ten gorillas that Damian and Tansy took to Gabon in June has already lost half its members. It is believed they may have been killed by other gorillas. Despite this setback, Damian says the other freed primates are living completely wild and are happy, healthy and calm. ‘Djalta and Bims looked healthy and settled. It’s nonsense that some scientists say they’ve lost their wild instincts. These animals have a right to go home. Nobody can convince me they don’t belong here.’ A Life With Animals is available from aspinallfoundation.org at £20 plus £3.99 p&p.","Tansy Aspinall, 25, was reunited with gorillas she knew as a child .

"Fast-food restaurants in the United States are 'disproportionately' targeting black children and kids in middle-income and rural areas, according to a newly published study. Researchers at Arizona State University and University of Illinois at Chicago looked at 6,716 fast-food outlets nationwide to check the extent of indoor and outdoor marketing aimed at youngsters. Marketing towards children ranged from free toys to ads featuring sports celebrities and cartoon characters, as well as play areas and promotions for kids' birthday parties. Fast-food restaurants in the United States are 'disproportionately' targeting black children and kids in middle-income and rural areas, according to a newly published study . 'Majority black communities, rural areas and middle-income communities are disproportionately exposed (to child-directed marketing) and specifically to indoor displays of kids' meal toys, a popular strategy among chain restaurants,' the study said. 'In light of these findings, it is important to urge the fast-food industry to limit children’s exposure to marketing that promotes consumption of unhealthy food choices.' The enduring popularity of fast food is widely seen as contributing to an obesity crisis in the United States, where one in three adults are considered obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In February, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported a 43 per cent fall in obesity rates among children aged two to five -- raising hopes that obesity might be on the wane.","Researchers at Arizona State University and University of Illinois at Chicago looked at 6,716 fast-food outlets nationwide .

"Four workers have been killed and one injured during a hazardous chemical leak at a Texas industrial plant. The chemical, methyl mercaptan, began leaking around 4am on Saturday morning in a unit at the DuPont plant in La Porte, about 20 miles east of Houston. Plant officials said the release was contained by 6am. Several employees had responded to the leak when they were exposed to the chemical, plant manager Randall Clements said in a statement. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Four workers have been killed and one injured following the leak of a hazardous chemical at a DuPont plant in La Porte, 20 miles east of Houston, Texas . Spread: Several employees had responded to the leak when they were exposed to the chemical. It could be smelt 40 miles away, but officials insist it was not a danger to the public . 'There are no words to fully express the loss we feel or the concern and sympathy we extend to the families of the employees and their co-workers,' Clements said. 'We are in close touch with them and providing them every measure of support and assistance at this time.' A fifth worker was hospitalized and being held for observation. That worker's condition was not immediately known, and none of the victims was immediately identified. According to ABC 13, one of them had been working at the plant for 40 years. Methyl mercaptan was used at the plant to create crop-protection products such as insecticides and fungicides, according to DuPont. The cause of the leak was not immediately known. Clements said DuPont would be cooperating with local, state and federal officials investigating the leak. 'As part of that investigation, we are conducting our own top-to-bottom review of this incident and we will share what we learn with the relevant authorities,' he said. Identities: The names of the victims were not released by police, however reports suggested one of the casualties had been working at the plant for around 40 years.

'It's a nuisance smell in the area. It's a smell that's traveled quite far,' Suggs said. Methyl mercaptan is also commonly used to odorize natural gas — which has no odor — for safety purposes. The La Porte plant has 320 DuPont employees. Four other companies are also tenants at the complex.","Employees were exposed at the DuPont plant in LaPorte near Houston .

"An NFL center who was offered a $35million contract to play for the St Louis Rams gave it all up to start a farm near his home. Jason Brown, 31, left football behind to grow sweet potatoes in his home county of Louisburg, North Carolina - despite being ranked one of the best players in the league. Brown decided his Christian faith would be better served by growing food for the needy than throwing balls on a pitch - and told his stunned agent he was turning down the lucrative deal with the Rams in April 2012. Drastic change: Jason Brown, 31, used to be a center for the St Louis Rams (left), but quit the game to buy a 1,000-acre farm in North Carolina, and give away the crops (right) He was told the move was 'the biggest mistake of your life' - but was adamant that returning to his rural homeland and taking up agriculture was the best decision he could make, CBS reported. Brown said God's plan was for him to start farming - even though he had no idea how - and to distribute the food that he grew. So Brown bought a 1,000-acre farm and used YouTube tutorials - and advice from local farmers - to start cultivating cucumbers and sweet potatoes on his plot. Giveaway: Volunteers are pictured above loading up a food bank truck with sweet potatoes to feed the needy . On the field: Brown said his football agent told him he was making a huge mistake turning down the money . 'When you see them pop up out of the ground, man, it's the most beautiful thing you could ever see', he said. After years of work restoring the land - dubbed First Fruits Farm - to arable condition, Brown has just given away his first crop - 100,000lbs of sweet potatoes. Writing on his farm's website, Brown said: 'God revealed to me that he had something greater in store for me and that my family should move back to my home state of North Carolina and start a farm. New life: Brown, left on the field in 2011, has said that farming is a far more fulfilling life than football . 'This really caught us by surprise because we knew nothing about farming. Yet, out of obedience, we started looking for available farmland. 'This is when Tay [his wife] and I made a covenant with God and told Him that whatever place He blessed us with, we would name it FirstFruits Farm and that his people would receive the FirstFruits of whatever is produced from the land.' Brown has said he aims to give away twice as much next year.","Jason Brown, 31, used to be highly-ranked center for St Louis Rams .

"Woolly mammoths could be brought back from extinction after a preserved body of one of the ancient animals was found frozen in the snowy wastes of Siberia, scientists hope. The mammoth, which took its last steps around 40,000 years ago, is in such good condition that biologists believe they may be able to clone the creature. An autopsy of the Ice Age beast, which has been nicknamed Buttercup by scientists, will be shown in a documentary later this month. Scroll down for video . Back from the dead? Scientists hope to bring woolly mammoths back from extinction after a preserved body of the ancient animal was found frozen in Siberia . An autopsy of the huge creature - nicknamed Buttercup - will be shown in a Channel 4 documentary later this month . The Channel 4 programme will also examine pioneering work on cloning the woolly mammoth, which is taking place in South Korea and the US. Scientists hope that, eventually, they will be able to reintroduce the huge creatures back into the wild, tens of thousands of years after they became extinct. Insung Hwang, a South Korean geneticist, told the Independent: 'Bringing back the mammoth either through cloning or genetic engineering would be an extremely long process. We're trying hard to make this possible within our generation.' 'That's why we have to start discussing the implications now. Some of our colleagues are still working on analysing the genome from Buttercup's specimen. This is a long and complicated process that is unlikely to be finished anytime in the near future.' Dr Tori Herridge, an expert on mammoth biology at the Natural History Museum who took part in the work, thinks cloning the animal would cause too much suffering for surrogate Asian elephants used in the process. She said: 'The guys from South Korea, who are collecting tissue for cloning, were excited because the better preserved the tissue, the greater their hopes were that there would be some intact DNA. The remains of the mammoth, which took its last steps around 40,000 years ago, are in such good condition that biologists believe they may be able to clone the creature . The scientists hope that, eventually, they will be able to reintroduce the huge creatures back into the wild, tens of thousands of years after they became extinct . 'The most fundamental step and ethical concern with this kind of procedure is that you need to have an Asian elephant surrogate mum at some point. Cloning a mammoth will require you to experiment on probably many, many Asian elephants. 'As a palaeontologist, you normally have to imagine the extinct animals you work on. 'So actually coming face-to-face with a mammoth in the flesh, and being up to my elbows in slippery, wet, and - frankly - rather smelly mammoth liver, counts as one of the most incredible experiences of my life. It's up there with my wedding day. 'The information gleaned from Buttercup's autopsy about her life and death, and the future discoveries that will come from analyses of her muscles and internal organs, will add to our understanding of these magnificent Ice Age beasts.' The adult female was discovered in May 2013. At 8ft tall, the mammoth, who is estimated to have died at the age of 50, is around the same size as an elephant. Most of her body, three legs, her head and her trunk were still intact, despite scientists believing Buttercup was eater by predators after becoming stuck in a bog.

"The old Liverpool siege mentality has returned ahead of their important encounter against Arsenal on Sunday which the club need to win to keep Champions League football a realistic proposition. Manager Brendan Rodgers, loquacious and engaging for the majority of his two-and-a-half years in charge at Anfield, has made it clear he has now had enough of the recent criticism and backbiting aimed at him and his players. Having pushed Manchester City so close to the title last season, Liverpool will kick off against Arsenal – whom they beat 5-1 in the corresponding fixture last February – in the bottom half of the Premier League table. Brendan Rodgers looks on during his side's morale-boosting Capital One Cup win against Bournemouth . Rodgers, hurt by attacks on his nine summer signings and repeated stories about Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli, is taking a leaf out of his predecessor Kenny Dalglish's book, drawing ranks and urging his players to prove everyone wrong. 'Seven months ago I was manager of the year, and tactically this and tactically that. Because we lost two world-class players, one out of the club (Luis Suarez) and one injured (Daniel Sturridge), I am useless,' he said, curtly. 'Football is a critical world. For some reason in the modern game, people don't think new players need time to develop. It is not the criticism to me personally (that angers). I am thinking of the team and the club.' The treatment dished out to Raheem Sterling seems to have particularly irked Rodgers. The 20-year-old scored his first goals since September in a morale-boosting 3-1 Capital One Cup victory at Bournemouth and been given a central attacking role with Sturridge out, and Balotelli and Rickie Lambert failing in front of goal. Sterling runs off to celebrate his first goal of the night as Liverpool beat Bournemouth on Wednesday night . There is uncertainty over Sterling's long-term future at Anfield with a new deal unsigned amidst reported interest from Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, but Rodgers – again circling the wagons – has hit out at suggestions the player has taken his eye off the ball after an impressive World Cup. 'He is another kid who is going to get destroyed,' warned Rodgers. 'He has just turned 20 years of age, he was the extra log on the fire for us last year, he was outstanding and this year he has been very good. On his own really. 'People ask if he is unhappy, you couldn't see a happier guy, he is not into discussing deals and money and yet I read about the greedy Sterling. 'The criticism has been unbelievable, it has been ongoing.' Rodgers will doubtless get sympathy from other leading managers about the impatience of supporters and former players-turned-television pundits in Sunday's game when results like last weekend's 3-0 defeat at Manchester United happen. England forward Sterling runs off to celebrate after giving Liverpool a 3-0 lead against the Championship side . Virtually every big-club manager bar Jose Mourinho has been under pressure at some point this season though interestingly we still await our first Premier League sacking of the season. Nobody has come under more scrutiny than Sunday's visitor to Anfield, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who signed a long-term contract at his club in the summer, just like Rodgers. Wenger, who lifted the FA Cup in May to end a nine-year trophy drought, has been at Arsenal 18 years and has three Premier League titles, two league and cup doubles, two European finals and a historic unbeaten season on his record. But recently he was abused by his own supporters after a defeat at Stoke City while a banner calling for his departure was held up in the away section at West Brom. Last season he was filmed and ridiculed for tripping over at a railway station after Arsenal's defeat at Anfield. Rodgers comes face-to-face with Gunners boss Arsene Wenger on Sunday at Anfield . ‘Some of the personal stuff he takes is disgraceful,’ said Rodgers. ‘He has been an iconic figure, a statesman.’ Rodgers will hope the cup triumph will mark a turning point for Liverpool because it represented a return to last season’s successful format. ‘If you look at the speed in our game, the tempo and intensity of our pressing and work was much closer to last season,’ he said. ‘It is a fair point that people are seeing we haven’t been as dynamic as the last couple of years.’ Rodgers hopes the 3-4-3 system he used at Dean Court to accommodate Sterling as a deep-lying centre forward able to break into space may be a template for better things. ‘A British coach, playing 3-4-3? He must have fell onto that system, a bit of luck,’ he said sarcastically. Rodgers seems to be having fun revealing a more spiky aspect of his nature. Now the players must follow suit.","Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has had enough of recent criticism .

"A judge on Friday rejected a bid by Canadian doctors to force an aboriginal girl into chemotherapy treatment in a groundbreaking ruling that affirms the right to pursue traditional healing over mainstream medicine. The decision allows the parents of the 11-year-old girl to pursue a course of cancer treatment rooted in their centuries-old native traditions, but critics warn the unproven treatment risks the girl's life. Doctors at McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, sued to have her placed in protective custody in order to force her into care after the family removed her from their care. The Globe and Mail reports that, with chemotherapy, the girl - who been identified only as J.J. and is suffering Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - has a 90 to 95 percent chance of living. Lost: Doctors at McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, sued to have a girl placed in protective custody in order to force her into chemotherapy after the family removed her from their care, but a judge ruled against it Friday . Without it she will die. Government child protection services had refused to intervene, citing indigenous peoples' rights and concerns about splitting her from a loving family. Doctors insisted that chemotherapy had a very high chance of curing her before she quit treatment in August after 10 days. The girl's mother then took her to a commercial holistic healing center in Florida. 'I cannot find that (the girl) is a child in need of protection when her (mother) has chosen to exercise her constitutionally-protected right to pursue their traditional medicine over the (doctors') stated course of treatment of chemotherapy,' Ontario Court Justice Gethin Edward was quoted as saying by public broadcaster CBC. Another aboriginal girl whose parents pursued the same alternative treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is now reportedly critically ill. Critics urged the McMaster doctors to appeal the ruling, while outside the court the family's supporters cheered. 'This is monumental,' said New Credit First Nations Chief Bryan Laforme. 'It reaffirms our right to be Indian and to practice our medicines in the traditional way.' The Ontario Children's Aid Society also applauded the outcome saying it will spare the girl the 'trauma' of being separated from her family during treatment. In May, Makayla Sault, an Obijwa girl from the New Credit First Nation reserve, read out a letter in a YouTube clip about how chemotherapy was 'killing' her body and that she saw a vision of Jesus who told her that she was already healed. Makayla was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in January and suffered terrible weakness and nausea from the chemotherapy used to treat it despite anti-nausea medications. She underwent 11 weeks of the chemo, which sent her cancer into remission. 'I have asked my mom and dad to take me off the treatment because I don't want to go this way anymore... I know that what I have can kill me, but I don't want to die in a hospital on chemo,' Mikayla says in the video. During the two weeks respite from chemo, Makayla's parents started her on a different form of treatment, which has left her feeling 'awesome,' she says. 'I wish that the doctors would listen to me, because I live in this body and they don't,' she said. It’s pure ignorance to think that Western medicine is the only answer,' First Nations healer James Carpenter, who claims to have successfully treated cancer, leukemia and other life-threatening illnesses, told CTV News. 'What medicine people do is they go to the spirit and ask that spirit and find a way within that person to help them,' said Carpenter, who works at the Anishnawbe Health Centre.","Mother of Canadian girl, 11 - identified only as J.J. - pulled her out of chemotherapy after 10 days in August .

"Nanny Yoselyn Ortega, 52, pictured in court in 2013, accused of killing two young children in their New York apartment, has apologized for what she did . A nanny accused of killing two children in the bathtub of their New York home said she was sorry for what she had done but maintains she is angry at how the parents treated her. Yoselyn Ortega has pleaded not guilty to butchering six-year-old Lucia Krim and two-year-old Leo Krim at their Upper West Side apartment in October 2012. Their mother Marina, 38, was out picking up her third child, Nessie, from a swimming lesson when she returned to find her children's bodies. Ortega, 52, then cut her throat while sitting next to them in a failed suicide bid. The court papers say the Dominican immigrant told authorities the little girl tried to fight back before she stabbed her and then killed the boy. She used at least two knives. 'Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I've done,' she said, according to the court papers. 'Relieve me of my misery.' The documents were included as exhibits in lengthy motions filed by defense attorney Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg. She asked that the prosecutor be dropped from the case and that the judge bar news media from an upcoming court hearing. Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro denied both requests. Van Leer-Greenberg has said Ortega cannot understand the case because of her injuries and because she suffers from delusions. But a judge found her fit for trial. Ortega's statements had not previously been made public. They included details from interviews with authorities after she regained consciousness. She told authorities she hurt the children because she was having money problems and was angry at the parents. She said her schedule constantly shifted, she had to act as a cleaning lady though she didn't want to and she missed an appointment with 'the psych,' according to the papers. Victims: Six-year-old Lucia Krim (left) and two-year-old Leo Krim (right) were found dead by their mother Marina in the bathtub in their Upper West Side home. Ortega was next to them trying to cut open her throat . Frustration: Ortega claims she was angry at the parents because her schedule constantly shifted, she had to act as a cleaning lady and she missed an appointment with 'the psych,' according to the papers . 'I had to do everything and take care of the kids,' she said. 'God forgive me, so many things they made me do. Pray for me.' In the moments before the killings, the children were out getting ice cream and going to a park because Lulu, as Lucia was called, didn't want to go to dance class, according to the court papers. The parents, Kevin and Marina Krim, have not spoken publicly about the killings. Last year, at a fundraiser for their nonprofit, they said they missed their children every day and will forever. 'We are just heartbroken,' Kevin Krim said. 'But they inspire us every day as well. Their lives give us a purpose.' Last year it was reported that when Ortega was shown the horrifying photos of the dead children, she asked: 'Oh, my God, who did that to them?' In interviews she has previously denied having anything to do with the case.","Yoselyn Ortega is accused of butchering Lucia Krim, six, Leo Krim, two .

"'Real women do curse. They sleep around, they use drugs, they do all sorts of different things and some of them are good mothers and some are bad mothers. They are multi-faceted.' Surprising words, you might think, for the woman still best known as a ditzy law student in Legally Blonde. But then the latest Hollywood epic, Wild, is new territory for Reese Witherspoon. Based on a best-selling 2012 book of the same name, the £30 million film is the remarkable story of how writer Cheryl Strayed set off on a 1,100-mile hike to 'find herself' after a bitter divorce and the death of her mother. Scroll down for video . Reese Witherspoon is starring in Hollywood epic, Wild, based on a 2012 book which follows to real-life story of how Cheryl Strayed set off on a 1,100-mile hike to 'find herself' The book chronicles Strayed's descent into heroin abuse, nights of casual sex – and how she 'emotionally rebuilt' herself during her epic journey. The film is tipped to earn Witherspoon her second Oscar. She says: 'After Cheryl's mother died, she was very self-destructive. She was married but she slept around. She had no respect for her husband and she had no respect for herself. 'She was so angry and in such pain that she wanted to do anything to help herself feel alive – that included having sex with strangers, doing drugs, putting herself in dangerous situations.' While the book and film closely guard the identity of the husband whose rejection prompted the marathon walk – both refer to him simply as 'Paul' – The Mail on Sunday can today reveal that he is 48-year-old baker Marco Littig. Witherspoon said writer Cheryl Strayed (right) was 'self-destructive' after the death of her mother, pictured at the premiere at the 58th BFI London Film Festival . Littig, now a happily married father-of-two living in rural Missoula, Montana, walked out on Strayed after she admitted repeatedly cheating on him. In his first ever interview about his famous former wife, he told the MoS that he held no grudges against her – but added that the painful disintegration of a marriage described in the book is all true. He said Cheryl and her family 'collapsed' after her mother died. 'We were just 21 when we married. We were much too young and we shouldn't have got married,' said Marco. 'I was the administrator, the caretaker. It was after [her mother] died that Cheryl started seeing other guys. It was the catalyst for a lot of what followed,' he explained. The film follows the story of how Strayed sets out to hike the Pacific Crest Trail all on her own after the breakdown of her marriage . 'She takes risks,' he said of Cheryl. 'She always took risks with her writing and she's an incredibly intelligent person. She just fell into this deep hole. Her perception was true and strong.' The last time Marco and Cheryl spoke was 16 years ago when she called up wondering if they could be friends again. He says he didn't see the need. Indeed, as the years went by, he was barely aware of Cheryl's book. 'My parents called and told me that Cheryl had written a book and that I was all over it. That was about six weeks after it had been published. I always figured that at some point in time I was going to end up somewhere in her writing.' 'I'm OK with it,' he said. 'I don't have a problem with what she's written. It was all true. It was very gracious.' The book was a New York Times bestseller and a selection for Oprah Winfrey's Book Club. It chronicles Strayed's descent into heroin abuse, nights of casual sex – and how she 'emotionally rebuilt' herself during her epic journey . Few outside his close family and friends know Marco is 'Paul'. But his hopes of remaining one step ahead of the past faded once Reese Witherspoon signed on to star as his ex-wife in the Hollywood version of her story. While Strayed, 46, has always refused to identify 'Paul', she spoke briefly about her guilt over the breakdown of their relationship in a recent interview saying: 'It was just so, so ugly and painful. 'I was tormented by it. I was devastated by the fact that I felt this deep need to leave the one person who was there for me.' Witherspoon, 38, who both stars in and produces the new movie, admitted to the MoS that the role had been emotionally and physically tough. 'Usually I can go in and out of a character, but this one was very difficult,' she said. 'I got quite angry and bitter and got into the 'don't give me any crap' attitude. After a while, my husband was like, 'Whoa! Are you still Cheryl right now? Because you do not sound like yourself.' And he said, 'OK… I love Cheryl, she's amazing, but I am going to be really happy when this movie is over.' 'I consider Cheryl a very dear friend now. But parts of her book were not easy to read and when we made the film I had to make the choice to tell all the parts, not just the ones that would make us like her, or it would just be a movie about a girl taking a walk. Witherspoon, 38, who both stars in and produces the new movie, admitted that the role had been emotionally and physically tough . 'And trust me, there were scenes in the movie that I did not want to do. There was one particular sex scene that I was dreading. 'The day before, I was calling Cheryl saying: 'I cannot believe I have to do that sex scene tomorrow.' She said, 'Reese, I'm sorry I was such a slut in the Nineties.' Witherspoon is convinced that how women are portrayed in films is changing. 'Twenty years ago, I used to sit in meetings with studio heads and they'd say, 'Well, this character mustn't curse. That's really not very likeable.' 'We don't have that idea of what a woman is any more: Is she good or is she bad? It's much more complex. 'I have had my own set of problems in life, some of which people know about and some people don't. 'But what I have learned from them is that there are times when you realise that no one is coming in to save you. You have to save yourself. No mother or father or relationship or baby is going to fix your problems. You have to find the inner strength to look after yourself.' The film didn't just take an emotional toll. 'In most movies where you carry a backpack, it's just filled with newspaper but this one was really heavy,' she laughed. 'Plus, the first few days were really cold and I had to wear shorts and a T-shirt and they had to spray me with water to look like I was sweating – and all the while, the guys on the other side of the camera were in hats and parkas and looking cosy while I was walking along pretending not to be shivering. 'About three days into the shoot, my shoulders hurt so bad and were so sore and I was freezing cold, and I called my husband and was sobbing, 'Oh, this movie is so hard! It's so cold!' He said, 'OK, honey, when you option a book called Wild about a woman who hikes 1,000 miles through the wilderness by herself… did you think it was going to be a super-easy, fun shoot?' 'I said - I know, shut up.'","Reese Witherspoon starring in Hollywood epic, Wild, based on 2012 book .

"Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher has questioned whether Liverpool did enough to keep Steven Gerrard at Anfield. Steven Gerrard has always been honest to a fault and even on Liverpool’s own club media he could not help but come clean about the reasons behind his seismic departure from Anfield. In an emotional interview, the 34-year-old admitted his fear at the prospect of becoming just a bit-part performer at the club where he is held up alongside Kenny Dalglish as the club’s greatest ever player was too devastating to contemplate. Hence the contract offer he was offered by the club in late October has remained unsigned and he will head to the United States in the summer for a new life. Steven Gerrard recalls a key conversation with Brendan Rodgers which swayed his mind to leave Liverpool . Gerrard spoke to LFCTV in an exclusive interview released on Saturday afternoon . ‘I think the key conversation or moment was with the manager when he sat me down not so long ago and said it was time to manage my games for me and for the team,’ said Gerrard, as he explained the decision that has caused shockwaves on Merseyside and beyond. ‘I’m bright enough to realise it is the right thing for everyone, but when you’ve been a starter and a mainstay in the team for such a long time, it was a very difficult conversation to have. ‘I accept it and I’ll continue to give everything I’ve got, whether I’m starting, coming off the bench or whatever, but that was the key conversation that swung me to deciding to come away for a short while. ‘The reality is I am going to be 35 in the summer. I’ve been here for a long time, I’ve been coming to this training ground since I was eight. I always knew it was going to end one day and that it was going to be an emotional decision. That decision is here.’ Gerrard was deeply hurt by being left out of Liverpool’s Champions League tie against Real Madrid earlier this season even though he knew manager Brendan Rodgers was only managing in the way he felt fit. He has subsequently been left out of some Premier League matches. The midfielder retired from international football after last summer’s World Cup to prolong his club career but even without international football Rodgers felt his legs and physical recovery were insufficient for him to play in every Liverpool game. And that would only have increased next season. The relationship between iconic captain and young manager has been under the spotlight all season. A piece by Gerrard’s friend Jamie Carragher suggesting Liverpool had not done enough to keep their leader only added fuel to the fire. In his own way, Gerrard tried to assure his fans that he can see Rodgers has acted with a professional hat, and that he didn’t feel his treatment has been anything personal. Steven Gerrard (centre) warms up during Liverpool's training session at Melwood on Saturday morning . Gerrard prepares for an FA Cup clash against AFC Wimbledon after announcing his decision to leave Liverpool . Liverpool's captain stretches with Jordan Henderson (left) and Emre Can (centre) at Melwood . Gerrard has confirmed he will leave Liverpool for a club in America, with LA Galaxy favourites to sign him . ‘I had an idea it was going to come at some time — I’m a human, not a robot. I’m not 24,’ he said. ‘I wish I was 24, I wish I’d met Brendan when I was 24 because I think I’d be sitting here talking about a lot of titles that we’d won together. The reality is, Brendan came into this club when I was 32 and it’s a shame that relationship didn’t start 10 years ago. ‘I had an idea the conversation was going to come at some time, but it was a painful conversation to have and that was the key moment.’ Rodgers confirmed there had been no offer of a coaching position to Gerrard in negotiations because he got the impression from the player that he wanted to continue being regarded purely as a player. ‘It wasn’t part of the conversations because Steven hasn’t got his badges, and he isn’t the type who will just go into coaching blind. ‘He is very thoughtful. His focus was very much in the present — which means playing because he still believes he can play beyond this season. ‘Steven knows that once he has finished playing there will be plenty of time for him to go into coaching if that’s what he wants to do.’ Liverpool has been like a city in mourning since Gerrard’s announcement. Los Angeles Galaxy looks his likeliest destination but for now the player admits his biggest challenge is keeping his own emotions in check so he can help Liverpool in the remaining months of the season. They are still in the Europa League, which may be their best route of qualifying for next season’s Champions League, and begin their FA Cup campaign at League Two AFC Wimbledon on Sunday night. ‘It’s been an emotional 24 hours for myself and my family, but there are still six months to go and I’ve still got plenty to try and achieve, so I am trying to keep my focus on that. There’ll be plenty of time for tears and sentiment come the end of the season,’ he insisted. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers insists he wanted to keep Gerrard at the club next season . Gerrard gives a thumbs up as he leaves Liverpool's Melwood training centre on Friday afternoon . Going to California with wife Alex and their three daughters doesn’t sound like a punishment but breaking the news that they would soon be leaving the only home they’ve known was not easy. ‘It was tough to tell the girls, even though they’re not big football fans,’ he said. ‘That’s when the emotion started in the house, that’s when it became tough. At the same time, it’s a great opportunity for my family and myself. But yes, it’s tough.’ Rodgers has a way with words that doesn’t always encourage sympathy. But the Ulsterman has been in an unenviable position over Gerrard.Such is the player’s legend — Huyton boy who singlehandedly won the Champions League and turned down Chelsea the same summer — Rodgers knows every time he left Gerrard out, it would create questions. And yet if he wants to deliver a new high-tempo Liverpool based around the likes of Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge, a break from Gerrard might suit him too. ‘I have not been party to whatever has gone on with the club and his agents, but we wanted to keep him at the club. I still wanted Steven to be a part of what I was doing at the club,’ he said on Saturday. ‘But it went on and on and nothing was agreed and the closer you get to January when a player is in the last year of his contract, he is not going to rush into things because he can speak to other clubs. Any player would do that.’ The popular outcome would be for Gerrard to enjoy the sunshine of Los Angeles for a couple of years, return to Anfield as a coach under Rodgers and one day become the manager of Liverpool himself. Yet both men know fairytales don’t always come true. Liverpool skipper Gerrard slots home the first of his two penalties against Leicester City on New Year's Day . Gerrard, pictured in action against Leicester, will join a Major League Soccer team in America . ‘I don’t see any reason why Steven couldn’t be a top manager,’ said Rodgers. ‘In my time here, he’s been a wonderful leader. If he puts that commitment into wanting to do it, like he’s shown in his football career, there’s no question why that couldn’t happen. ‘But time will tell on that. You can’t just click your fingers and do it. It’s a pressure situation. And if it’s something you’re not accustomed to or used to it can be hard.’ Neither is Gerrard naive. ‘I will only come back and serve the club if I feel I can help. I’ll always be a fan, of course, no matter what happens in the future. But I wouldn’t like to come back just to be Steven Gerrard the player and just be around.’ For now, Gerrard has professed to have been overcome by the tributes and messages from team-mates, supporters and people in his city. ‘I didn’t realise it would be as big as this,’ he says. He has personally promised Rodgers there will be ‘no downing of tools’ between now and May. This year’s FA Cup final will be on Gerrard’s 35th birthday — what a way that would be to go out. The professional paths of Rodgers and Gerrard are going to diverge in six months’ time. But if it’s to be called divorce, at least it is an amicable one.","Steven Gerrard has announced he will leave Liverpool this summer .

"McDonald's are at war with a group of elderly patrons who spend sunrise to sunset hogging booths at one New York restaurant, often sharing little more than a small bag of fries between them. Staff at the branch in Flushing, Queens are becoming increasingly frustrated with the Korean pensioners who pass hours gossiping at the window-seat tables amid piles of newspapers but buying very little - with a few admitting they don't even like the food. Management have been forced to call police to move on the ever-evolving group as they are driving away business. Some customers have asked for refunds because there is nowhere to sit. A McDonald's branch in Flushing, Queens was at odds with group of elderly Koreans in January whom they said hog the tables for hours on end but buy very little . The McDonald's in Flushing where the elderly patrons have frustrated the restaurant chain by taking up all the seats, often for hours at a time . Sun Kim, 64, who was enjoying a coffee, fries and reading newspapers with a group of six friends in McDonald's, told MailOnline that she understood it was bad for business but that they needed a place to go. She said: 'It is open so early and stays open until after dark when it's late. It's warm and the old people like to have a place to meet and talk together.' The battle between the pensioners and McDonald's has escalated over the past few months with the . police receiving four 911 calls since November about the group. A police source told MailOnline that people usually leave when asked by officers without any problems. However the defiant patrons admit that they just take a walk around the block and come back in again. Police could prosecute patrons for trespassing if they refused to leave and the restaurant requested, but hope the matter could be worked out before that stage. The McDonald's in Flushing is the popular hang-out spot for some of the elderly Korean community in the area . It appears that the group of men, and some women, are drawn to the McDonald's on the corner of Parsons and Northern Boulevards, because it offers a convenient meeting spot from their homes. However beyond these reasons, many cannot explain why they love to meet at McDonald's so much. The elderly Koreans' allegiance to the neon-lit branch is especially peculiar as there are other options available to the chatty seniors. The Korean Community Service Center in Flushing offers breakfast and lunch for the elderly every day. Many eat meals at the center - then head for McDonald's. President of the center Kwang Kim told MailOnline that he provides coffee and snacks for the senior citizens from 8.30am to 5pm every day but 'they don't come'. However Sun Kim told MailOnline that the senior center was not open for long enough to suit her and her friends' needs. Flushing Senior Center offers the Korean community breakfast and lunch daily. They have even started offering coffee for 25c to ease the McDonald's battle . The elderly people sometimes alternate with a Burger . King nearby on Northern Boulevard which has more space and community . boards inside for customers in English, Chinese and Korean. Jack Bert, who owns the Flushing McDonald's franchise, said in a statement: . 'I'm sure you can imagine any business would find this situation to be . difficult when customers prevent other customers from enjoying the . restaurant. 'We . continue to work to resolve this situation and create an environment so . customers who wish to enjoy this restaurant have the ability to do so.'","Staff at the branch in Flushing, Queens are becoming increasingly frustrated with the pensioners who are driving away business .
It is unclear why the seniors love McDonald's so much when they have a senior center nearby with 25c coffee .

"Expectant parents who cannot wait to hold their new child can now buy a three-dimensional model of the foetus to cradle and show friends. Japanese inventors have devised a way to transform the commonplace ultrasound scan into an anatomically correct resin replica for parents to handle and keep as a memento. The nine-centimetre (3.6-inch) resin model of the white foetus, encased in a transparent block in the shape of the mother's body, is fashioned by a 3D printer after an MRI scan. Expectant parents in Japan who can't wait to show the world what their baby will look like can now buy a 3D model of the foetus to pass around their friends . FASOTEC, the company offering the 'Shape of an Angel' model, even offers parents a miniature version which could be a 'nice adornment to a mobile phone strap or key chain.' Tomohiro Kinoshita, of FASOTEC, said: 'As it is only once in a lifetime that you are pregnant with that child, we received requests for these kind of models from pregnant women who... do not want to forget the feelings and experience of that time.' The 'Shape of an Angel' costs 100,000 yen (or around £760), and the company said the ideal time for a scan is around eight or nine months into the pregnancy. The company also offers the acrylic resin scan as a small charm 'perfect for hanging from a mobile phone or key chain' For those who would like a less pricey version, the company will start offering a 3D model of the face of the foetus at 50,000 yen - £380 -  in December. It will use ultrasound images taken at a medical clinic in Tokyo that has forged a tie-up with the company. FASOTEC, originally a supplier of devices including 3D printers, uses a layering technique to build up three-dimensional structures. The company also produces 3D models of internal organs that can be used by doctors to plan surgery or by medical students for training, a spokesman said. It is also possible that models can be used in hospitals to better inform patients what their problems are, instead of relying on difficult-to-understand diagrams. The technology 'realises not only the form but also texture of the model -- for example making it hard or soft', the firm said . 'By making a model that is similar to a real organ or bone, one can simulate operations and practise different surgical techniques.' Kinoshita said the company hit upon the idea of making 3D models of unborn babies in the hope that people would become more aware of the technology. But there are medical benefits too. The company said some medics could also foresee diagnostic possibilities with the models that may help predict difficulties in the birthing process.Three-dimensional printers have been around for several decades but advances in the technology mean it is now gaining in popularity in several fields. Soon the company will be offering parents a model of their unborn child's face . The machines work in a similar way to an inkjet printer, but instead of ink they deposit layers of material on top of each other, gradually building up the product they are making. Where traditional manufacturing only becomes efficient with economies of scale because of the need to produce moulds, 3D printing is capable of producing single copies of relatively complicated objects. The technology is not yet advanced enough to build telephones or computers but it is already used to make components.","The scan and model cost 100,000 yen - around £760 - from a Japanese company .
The model is even available in a miniature version 'perfect for a key chain'
Soon parents will also be able to order a replica of just the face of their foetus too ."
"A Sikh college student has sued the Army, saying he cannot join the Reserve Officer Training Corps unless he violates his religious beliefs by removing his turban, shaving and cutting his hair. The group United Sikhs and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Iknoor Singh, a 19-year-old from the New York City borough of Queens. Singh, a sophomore studying finance and business analytics at Hofstra University on Long Island, said he has had a lifelong interest in public service and began thinking of a military career several years ago. His lawsuit said he speaks four languages — English, Punjabi, Hindi, and Urdu — and he said he wants to work in military intelligence. Iknoor Singh, a student at Hofstra University, says the U.S. Army is barring him from the Reserve Officer Training Corps unless he violates his religious beliefs by removing his turban, shaving and cutting his hair . 'It has been one of those passions and dreams,' he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview this week. 'If you look back in history, Sikhs have a very rich military tradition. We have always stood up to oppression and stand up for justice.' Sikhism, a 500-year-old religion founded in India, requires its male followers to wear a turban and beard and keep their hair uncut. Under a policy announced in January, troops can seek waivers on a case-by-case basis to wear religious clothing, seek prayer time or engage in religious practices. Approval depends on where the service member is stationed and whether the change would affect military readiness or the mission. There are currently only a few Sikhs serving in the U.S. Army who have been granted religious accommodations. Under a policy announced in January, troops can seek waivers on a case-by-case basis to wear religious clothing, seek prayer time or engage in religious practices . But ACLU Attorney Heather Weaver said the only remedy offered to Singh is a Catch-22: He must comply with military rules and only then ask for a waiver that would allow him to wear his turban, beard and long hair. Singh is being permitted to audit the ROTC classes, said Lt. Col. Daniel Cederman, commander of Hofstra's program, which trains students to become commissioned officers. Bur Singh and his attorneys argue that he is not receiving credit for the classes, nor is he eligible for potential ROTC scholarships because he is not an actual enlistee. Weaver also said Singh will not be permitted to audit the classes after his sophomore year. Lt. Col. Ben Garrett said in a statement that the Army does not comment on pending litigation. He said the service is 'a diverse force with a long history of accommodating the religious practices of its members and the rights of soldiers to observe the tenets of their respective religions, or to observe no religion at all.' A statement from Hofstra said it supports 'Singh's ambitions to serve his country. ... We very much hope that the Army will permit us to enroll Mr. Singh in the program as a full cadet.'","The group United Sikhs and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Iknoor Singh, a 19-year-old from Queens .

"Former Rangers manager Ally McCoist is looking to return to management in England and was considered for the post at Aston Villa before Tim Sherwood was appointed. McCoist, 52, has decided to make himself available for other jobs even though he is guaranteed being paid by Rangers until the end of the year. The Ibrox legend handed in his notice as manager there after he learned about other staff losing their jobs, and Rangers placed him on 12 months gardening leave in December. Former Rangers manager Ally McCoist is actively looking for new managerial work in England . McCoist, who left Rangers earlier this season, is earning £800,000-a-year on gardening leave . Aston Villa were made aware of his availability following last week's sacking of Paul Lambert and McCoist was on their shortlist as an alternative before Sherwood was appointed on Saturday. Ironically, the Scot – also popular as a long-time captain television quiz show A Question of Sport – is earning more money at Rangers now than when he did work. In 2013, he voluntarily took a 50% pay cut on his £800,000-a-year wages to help the club get over their financial problems, but that no longer applies. However, despite being able to sit and collect the money without working, McCoist is actively looking to continue his managerial career as soon as possible and is casting his eyes south of the border. McCoist was considered for the Aston Villa manager's job but Tim Sherwood was eventually chosen . The Scottish manager celebrates winning the Scottish Third Division title at Ibrox last season . He scored 396 goals in a glittering playing career for St Johnstone, Sunderland, Rangers, Kilmarnock and Scotland and returned to Ibrox as manager in 2011. However, McCoist had to contend with ownership battles off-the-pitch for the majority of his time in charge. Ironically, his link to Villa comes at a time when there are no Scottish managers in the top-flight of English football for the first time since 1984. If McCoist was to take up a Premier League job, he would be the only Scottish manager in the top flight .","Former Rangers boss is actively looking for a new job in England .

"A Houston-area man, originally from Jordan, has been charged in the 2012 shooting death of an Iranian student and women's rights activist. Spokesman Jeff McShan says a grand jury in Houston indicted 56-year-old Ali Irsan on Thursday in the January 2012, killing of 30-year-old Gelareh Bagherzadeh. Bagherzadeh was shot to death as she talked with her boyfriend on her cellphone. Ali Mahwood-Awad Irsan, of Conroe, is charged with felony murder in the shooting death of Bagherzadeh. Irsan, 56, was arrested Thursday morning and is being held without bond . Charged:  Ali Mahwood-Awad Irsan, 56,  is in federal custody, though it's not clear on what charges . Murdered: A 56-year-old Texas man has been indicted in the mysterious shooting death of Gelareh Bagherzadeh, an outspoken Iranian activist who was killed two years ago outside her parents' affluent Houston townhouse . Federal agents in body armor descended upon several locations in Montgomery County on Thursday, and three people were taken into custody . According to the U.S. Attorney¿s Office, FBI agents and authorities with the Social Security ¿ Office of Inspector General were assisted by local law enforcement officers in the raids . Her body was discovered slumped behind the wheel of her car after crashing into the upscale Houston townhome complex where she lived with her parents. Bagherzadeh was a molecular genetic technology student at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. She was also an outspoken Iranian activist. Friends have said she told them . she was once arrested for not wearing the correct dress, and had been . strictly disciplined for dating a man who was considered inappropriate. She told them she was so sick of Islam that she converted to Christianity and was baptized at Second Baptist Church. Shot to death: Gelareh Bagherzadeh was shot to death outside her Galleria area town home on January 15, 2012. Her car was found at the back of a town home complex . Sealed off: Crime scene tape marks a rural Montgomery County property where Ali Mahwood-Awad Irsan, 56, was arrested in a raid by FBI agents on Thursday . The U.S. Attorneys Office says three people are in custody on federal fraud charges. One of those arrested sat smiling in the rear of a police car. The police presence was significant as heavily armed officers -- some in paramilitary gear -- searched at least four properties around Montgomery County . In . the wake of Iran's 2009 presidential elections, widely regarded as . fraudulent, Bagherzadeh joined dozens of Houston Iranians in protest, . even appearing on TV. In January 2012 she was driving from the Beavers' home in Spring when she was shot while turning into her parents' town home . She was chatting on the phone with a friend who told police he heard her scream before her car crashed into a garage. Police say the assailant fired several times at close range through the glass of her passenger window. The . mystery deepened 11 months later, in November 2012, when the twin . brother of Bagherzadeh's boyfriend was found dead from multiple gunshot . wounds inside his apartment.

"When renowned hard-man Vinnie Jones admits to being taken aback at the levels of violence that Wimbledon team-mate John Fashanu was capable of when they were part of the club’s notorious Crazy Gang in the 1980s, you are not surprised to hear the powerful striker and former host of hit TV show Gladiators was no bleeding heart liberal. Nevertheless, it is shocking — and doubtlessly refreshing to some — to hear the man once dubbed ‘Fash the Bash’ not only defending his behaviour more than 25 years ago, but also regretting that modern football and society in general has gone soft in a way that prevents people like him ‘rising from the gutter into fame and fortune’, as he puts it. Fashanu, 52, last week travelled from Nigeria where he is a successful businessman, to London for the premiere of a TV documentary on The Crazy Gang, to be screened on BT Sport on Boxing Day. John Fashanu is restrained by the referee during a match between Wimbledon and Middlesbrough . Former Wimbledon duo Fashanu and Vinnie Jones (right) embrace after Jones rejoined the club in 1992 . Fashanu, who used to present TV show Gladiators, is now a successful businessman in Nigeria . It charts the rise of Wimbledon from a non-League club to winning the FA Cup in 1988. Some of the stories are hair-raising. Jones, whose tough-guy reputation saw him forge a Hollywood career, described one dressing-room fight: ‘Fash literally lifted him up, swung him around and smashed him down on the floor and his calf just obliterated.’ Fashanu revels in ruling by fear and admitted: ‘There were times when we were 200 per cent physical. We believed we were warlords because at three o’clock on a Saturday, it was war.’ Former Wimbledon owner Sam Hammam and ex-manager Dave Bassett have condemned the film for focusing on the violence rather than the club’s amazing rise from the Southern League to playing the likes Manchester United and Liverpool. 'Fash the Bash', as he was known, grabs the throat of Glyn Hodges as tempers flare . Vinnie Jones (left), Sam Hammam (centre) and  Fashanu celebrate after a match against Manchester United . Fashanu says it is wrong to suggest that Wimbledon were only about bullying but in an exclusive interview with the Mail on Sunday, he refused to apologise for the way he behaved — and for maintaining some strong views that, in today’s society, are very controversial. Referring to himself in the third person, he describes life at a club he joined from Millwall in 1986. ‘Fash was a physical bastard and you would either have to adapt or dissolve as a person,’ he declares. ‘The players ran the club and if you were a wise manager, you would work with us, not against us.’ Discipline was enforced by kangaroo courts, chaired by Jones and Fashanu, ruling on anything from timekeeping to dress code. Tottenham defender Gary Mabbutt was left with a fractured skull after a clash with Fashanu in 1993 . Mabbutt lays on the ground (centre) after clashing with Wimbledon's Fashanu and sustaining fractured skull . ‘The Wimbledon players didn’t have money at that stage, we couldn’t fine you, so the best we could do is beat the crap out of you. ‘That is how we got our success. We are not here to apologise, we are here to tell you how it worked. ‘Once, one of our lads wouldn’t pay a fine, Vinnie and Wisey (Dennis Wise) went to get him, I locked the door of the changing-room and when the door is locked, it is only me, him and God who knows what’s happened. But I assure you, you come out looking different than when you went in. ‘People will now go, “Well, that was too much intimidation”. I’m sorry, in the world we were living in then, it was part of the qualities of leadership, intimidation.’ Fashanu was an intimidating figure to both the opposition and his own team-mates, it has been revealed . Referee Keith Hacket gets an earful from Fashanu and John Scales during a win against Southampton . Dressed in an expensive suit and delighted to be around former team-mates like Dave Beasant, Terry Gibson and John Scales, the gregarious Fashanu does not now carry an air of malice. A former Doctor Barnardo’s boy who was fostered with his brother, Justin, by a Norfolk family, he is proud that the Crazy Gang helped people like him and hod carrier Jones to be successful. ‘Wimbledon was a hard team,’ he says. ‘They were hard boys. We had all come from broken homes, no money, we were the rags-to-riches story. I work on $20 million projects now in Nigeria. It is because of my background at Wimbledon. I was able to come from the gutter to rise to fame and fortune, Vinnie Jones fame and fortune, Dennis Wise fame and fortune.’ Fashanu says the worst crime at Wimbledon was trying to break up a fight on the pitch rather than piling in to support your team-mate. ‘It was about camaraderie. English football is the working man’s game, the Vinnie Jones tackle. We don’t support the Barcelona and Real Madrids, ping-ping-ping.’ The Wimbeldon team following their victory over Liverpool at Wembley . Fashanu (centre) and Vinnie Jones (right) were central figures in Wimbledon's Crazy Gang . Not surprisingly, he is in despair over what he sees as the liberalisation of football — and life, too. ‘On the pitch, we’ve definitely gone soft. It’s got to the extent where there is no physical play. Football is physical, a contact sport. ‘Everything in life has become far too liberal, my good Lord. Anything goes in England now. Try telling your son to go to bed at 12 o’clock. The son will slap your face. You can’t do anything, if my son is sitting there, I’m even scared of him. “Come on son, let’s go”. “I don’t want to go”. “OK, stay there then”. I don’t want to touch him — it’s ridiculous, rubbish. I am from the old school. If he does something wrong, I’ll give him a clip and off we go. That’s how you become a man. ‘What I am saying is what I believe and what everyone else believes but daren’t say. You’re not going to have your 16-year-old daughter coming back with her boyfriend and sleeping in the side bedroom, and allow it. What the hell. That’s liberalisation, I am sorry.’","John Fashanu was part of the Wimbledon side that rose from non-League to win the FA Cup in 1988 .

"Interpol has issued an international arrest warrant for ‘White Widow’ Samantha Lewthwaite, a prime  suspect in the Kenyan shopping mall massacre. The high-priority ‘Red Notice’ for the arrest of the 29-year-old widow of 7/7 suicide bomber Jermaine Lindsay was made at the request of the Kenyan authorities. The warrant, which included four pictures of British Muslim convert Lewthwaite, relates to charges of being in possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit terrorist crimes in Mombasa, dating back to December 2011. The Interpol webpage showing the arrest notice for Samantha Lewthwaite, the fugitive Briton dubbed the White Widow' It does not mention the weekend attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya’s capital Nairobi, which was carried out by the Somali-based Al Shabaab group linked to Lewthwaite, and is feared to have killed 130 people. But the timing of the warrant at the height of investigations into the slaughter of shoppers is seen as hugely significant, suggesting the  Kenyan authorities and other international agencies believe she is alive and was not killed during the four-day siege that left five terrorists dead. Several witnesses, including soldiers and some of the wounded, have spoken of a white woman being among the Al Shabaab gunmen. Fugitive: Interpol has issued an arrest notice for White Widow Samantha Lewthwaite who is suspected of masterminding the Kenya mall massacre . Two claimed she was giving orders to those doing the killing, prompting the belief Lewthwaite was involved directly or as one of the masterminds. Western security officials in Nairobi say there is growing evidence that several of the terrorists escaped in the chaos following the first shootings on  Saturday, raising the possibility that Lewthwaite was among them. Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble said: ‘By requesting a Red Notice, Kenya has activated a global “tripwire” for this fugitive. ‘Through . the Interpol Red Notice, Kenyan authorities have ensured that all 190 . member countries are aware of the danger posed by this woman, not just . across the region but also worldwide.’ A . Twitter account claiming to be run by Al Shabaab claimed yesterday: ‘We . now have permission to disclose the involvement of Samantha Lewthwaite, . Sherafiyah. She successfully overseered [sic] the mission.’ The alleged . bomb plot in Mombasa which prompted the Red Notice relates to plans to . carry out a series of attacks against Western targets, including hotels . and British tourists.

"Hospitals have been accused of 'secretly closing their doors' by turning away thousands of patients for surgery unless they live nearby. At least four major NHS trusts have stopped accepting patients for routine procedures because they cannot deal with soaring numbers of referrals. The move appears to breach the legally-binding NHS Constitution, which gives patients the right to be treated wherever they want, however far they have to travel. Many patients choose to bypass their local district hospital in favour of a larger teaching trust that specialises in an area of medicine. Hospitals have been accused of 'secretly closing their doors' by turning away thousands of patients for surgery unless they live nearby . Yet bosses say they have no choice but to prioritise people from the catchment area to cope with rising referrals. One critic last night said: 'The idea was patients could choose their hospital, now it's changed to hospitals choosing their patients.' Salford Royal Hospitals in Greater Manchester, Oxford University Hospital Trust, University Hospitals Birmingham and Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals have all admitted restricting surgery for patients living outside their catchment area in the last few months. Other struggling trusts are likely to follow suit to reduce patient numbers and meet waiting-time targets. Many patients choose to bypass their local district hospital in favour of a larger teaching trust that specialises in an area of medicine . Last night, Roy Lilley, a health policy analyst and former chairman of an NHS trust, accused hospitals of 'turning off the tap'. 'I'm sure patients will be horrified to learn if they live in the wrong place they won't get treated. 'Because hospitals are more worried about breaching targets and regulators than patients and relatives they are secretly closing their doors to avoid over-running and breaching targets and getting described as failing and being put in special measures.' Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: 'Hospitals are turning people away and cancelling operations to cope with the unfolding chaos. The NHS Constitution gives patients clear rights and they are in danger of being breached.' University Hospitals Birmingham imposed restrictions in September covering non-urgent operations including orthopaedic and general surgery such as slipped discs. It will only accept patients from within two so-called clinical commissioning groups – local NHS bodies – in the city centre rather than from the suburbs and surrounding counties. The trust said the 'unprecedented rise' in patients had led to longer waiting times which posed a risk to those needing more urgent heart or liver surgery. Salford Royal stopped accepting patients for hip and knee replacements and skin cancer procedures if they live closer to another hospital. Oxford University Hospitals Trust is turning away patients who need spinal operations, while Hull and East Yorkshire is doing the same for neurosurgery. The restrictions were uncovered by the Health Service Journal using Freedom of Information requests. All four trusts said demand had 'increased significantly' in the past few years and that the restrictions were a temporary measure while they cleared a backlog. But Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: 'The NHS must abide by its own rules and provide the services to patients which they are legally obliged to provide.' The restrictions are further evidence that the NHS is struggling to meet the needs of the rising and ageing population. Waiting times for operations are at their highest for more than six years and hospitals will come under further pressure over the winter, when health bosses are braced for an expected surge in cases of chest infections, flu and norovirus. The NHS's medical director Professor Bruce Keogh also urged the public to go to their pharmacy instead of A&E wherever possible to prevent overcrowding. The chief executive of an NHS trust in the West Midlands warned of severe overcrowding as he suddenly resigned this week. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'While we understand the pressures that the NHS is under, all patients have the right to choose where they are treated and we expect all trusts to respect these decisions.'","Four major NHS trusts have stopped accepting patients for routine surgery .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has defended his decision to honour the Duke of Edinburgh with a knighthood, despite widespread backlash from Cabinet colleagues. Mr Abbott faced a storm of criticism on Australia Day and was accused of creating a 'time warp' by awarding a member of Britain's royal family the country's highest honour. Cabinet members said the Prime Minister did not consult with any of them before making his decision, with one senior politician claiming he thought it was an April's Fool's Day joke. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has defended his decision to honour the Duke of Edinburgh with a knighthood, despite a furore of backlash from Cabinet colleagues . Mr Abbott defended his decision, claiming 93-year-old Philip has been granted the Knight of the Order of Australia award for a long life of duty and service. But some of the country's senior politicians, along with many Twitter users, aired their opposition to the announcement.. The government head of the Northern Territory, Adam Giles, said he did not think the news was serious on first reading. 'I woke up this morning and read the wires and I thought it was April Fool's Day,' he said. 'I think it takes away from the legitimacy of the knighthood role. I think it makes a bit of a joke in a range of areas.' Speaking to the ABC, Mr Giles made it clear that he was opposed to the knighthood. 'It's Australia Day,' he said. 'We're not a bunch of tossers, let's get it right.' he said. Many Cabinet members said they would have opposed the idea should it have been presented to them. Mr Abbott faced a barrage of questions on Australia Day, and has been accused of creating a 'time warp' by awarding a member of Britain's royal family the country's highest honour . The government head of the Northern Territory, Adam Giles, said he did not think the news was serious on first reading.'I woke up this morning and read the wires and I thought it was April Fool's Day,' he said . Opposition leader Bill Shorten also said some thought the announcement was a hoax. 'I think that on Australia Day, where we're talking about Australia, Australian identity, the government's managed to find a British royal to give a medal to, a knighthood to. I've just been at citizenship functions, local breakfasts - some people there wondered whether it was an Australia Day hoax,' he told Fairfax Radio in  Melbourne . 'There is an old saying that when you are in a hole you should stop digging,' one minister said. 'Well, we've just punched through the Earth's crust.' Online reaction ranged from disbelief to mockery. One Twitter user wrote: 'So proud. Australia knights Prince Philip. Who needs satire?' while another said: 'Congratulations Prince Philip on your knighthood, and congratulations the Middle Ages on becoming a thing again!' Mr Abbott dismissed much of the social media reaction as having little ' authority and credibility'. He told broadcasters: 'I'll leave social media to its own devices. Social media is like electronic graffiti and I think that in the media you make a big mistake to pay too much attention to social media. Mr Abbott defended his decision, claiming the 93-year-old Duke has been granted the Knight of the Order of Australia award for a long life of duty and service . Opposition leader Bill Shorten also said some thought the announcement was a hoax . 'In a sense it has about as much authority and credibility as graffiti that happens to be by means of IT.' He later added: 'The monarchy has been an important part of Australia's life since 1788.  And Prince Philip has been a great servant of Australia. 'He's been a great servant of all the countries of the Commonwealth. Here in this country, he's the patron of hundreds of organisations.' The Duke's knighthood was announced alongside that of Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, for his military service and his involvement in the country's response to the MH370 and MH17 air disasters last year. Mr Abbott cited Prince Philip's Duke of Edinburgh award scheme as having helped thousands of young people in Australia for more than 50 years. The Duke's son the Prince of Wales was made a Knight of the Order of Australia in 1981. The Duke last visited Australia in 2011, the year he turned 90. The Duke's knighthood was announced alongside that of Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, for his military service and his involvement in the country's response to the MH370 and MH17 air disasters last year . He completed an 11-day official royal tour alongside the Queen, during which they visited Perth, Melbourne, Canberra and Brisbane. In 2002, Philip caused controversy during an official tour of Australia when he asked an Aboriginal businessman: 'Do you still throw spears at each other?' Aboriginal cultural park owner William Brim replied: 'No, we don't do that any more.' Mr Brim, who met the Duke during  a royal visit to the  Tjapukai Aboriginal Park in northern Cairns,  later said he was not offended, describing the question as 'naive'. He added. 'To me he was just a bit of a larrikin (joker).'

"Scott Sinclair is acutely aware the last two years have seen him pictured more frequently perusing the shops of Manchester alongside his famous girlfriend than on the pitch. He hopes his move to Aston Villa will redress that balance, beginning with Sunday's trip to Arsenal. Sinclair is bursting to remind people of his talent, of those performances for Swansea that earned him an £8million move to Manchester City in 2012. His career at the Etihad, on wages of £50,000 per week, never got going and reached a nadir when he was forced to train alone as his team-mates competed for points in matches. New signing Scott Sinclair poses with his new Aston Villa shirt following his arrival from Manchester City . Villa could make Sinclair's loan deal permanent at the end of the season . Sinclair claims his best is yet to come following his arrival at Aston Villa from Manchester City . As the profile of his long-term partner Helen Flanagan rocketed through her appearance on ‘I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!’, Sinclair was left looking like a forgotten footballer. A loan to West Bromwich Albion last season was undermined by a three-month hamstring injury and managerial upheaval, meaning he has not completed 90 minutes of a Premier League match since May 2012. He sees this move to Villa Park — where he has a clause in his contract that allows him to pull out of a permanent £2.5m summer transfer if they are relegated this season — as key in kick-starting his career. He said: ‘At City, I would be on my own with another coach and just going through drills. It has been very difficult. It has tested me mentally as a football player. Hopefully now there is light at the end of the tunnel and I can leave that behind me. Villa new boy Sinclair is greeted by Fabian Delph at the club's training ground at Bodymoor Heath . Delph and Sinclair share a joke as Sinclair seals a move away from Manchester City . Sinclair had started to become overshadowed by his long-term partner Helen Flanagan . ‘It defines you as a person how much you want to play football. That’s why I’m here now. I want to show everyone — and most of all I want to prove to myself — that it’s not just about the money. I want to be back out there. ‘What I’ve done on the pitch hasn’t left me. The only thing is form. Because I haven’t played for so long maybe it’s going to take me a few games.’ He smiles when it is suggested he might want to wrestle back the column inches from Flanagan, the former Coronation Street actress, but acknowledges his presence in the sports pages will provide a gauge of his success. ‘We have a baby on the way and she is not too fussed about being in the public eye at this moment in time. I want to be on back pages,’ he said. ‘She is due in June. That is another reason why I want to be settled and know where I am going. I have to focus and want to stay here at Villa. ‘People who don’t know me think, “Right, Scott Sinclair, he has a celebrity girlfriend, he has money and he doesn’t care about football”. I know that’s not true. I still have the love of the game and want to be out there and starting to prove myself.’","Scott Sinclair struggled to impress during his time at Manchester City .

'As I conceive it, skin painting marks a person's external appearance while also bringing out the inner self,' Jean-Paul said.

"Two thirds of bright teenagers are missing out on key academic GCSEs, school league tables reveal. More than 111,000 of the 177,000 children who shone in tests at the age of 11 have gone on to study the softer subjects often shunned by employers. While all pupils must study English, maths and science, the tables suggest schools are steering youngsters toward drama, sociology and vocational qualifications – which are seen as easier to do well in – for their remaining subjects. Schools Minister Nick Gibb (right) said: 'Children only have one chance at education. These tables show which . schools are letting children down' Less than four in ten pupils across the state sector sit a GCSE in foreign languages, while just under half opt for geography or history. The Coalition has introduced a new . measure to check how many pupils score grades A* to C in English, maths . and science, as well as a language and a humanities subject such as . history or geography. Before . the introduction of this ‘English Baccalaureate’, the measure was five . good grades in maths and English and in any three other subjects. The tables published yesterday show the success rate for thousands of state schools plunged when the EBacc was taken into account. One school scored 92 per cent on the old measure but just 6 per cent on the new. The tables also revealed how low, medium and high achievers performed in their GCSEs last year. Among the pupils who had surpassed expectations in national curriculum tests at 11, 62.8 per cent – 111,437 – failed to achieve the EBacc. Less than half of this 177,447-strong cohort had been entered for all the EBacc subjects in the first place. In 285 schools, not a single high achiever gained the award. Thousands of bright pupils are also effectively going backward in English and maths at secondary school. Some 22,713 – 12.8 per cent – are not making the progress expected of them in English and 26,262 – 14.8 per cent – are not improving sufficiently in maths. Chris McGovern, a former headmaster and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said bright children were ‘clearly being failed’. He added: ‘This is a betrayal of a generation of children who are not being prepared for the 21st century and they’re not being prepared to help sustain this country with the economic challenges it faces. ‘It’s failing children and damaging the country. The consequences will be found out in five, ten years’ time when we’re not producing the engineers and the scientists but we are producing the media studies students.’ Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘The emphasis in recent years has been getting as many children as possible up to the floor targets and we haven’t been giving enough attention to our brightest pupils. ‘It’s important that young people study the core subjects because that keeps their options open. ‘Within our system, where schools have been judged in terms of GCSE points, it’s been too easy and too tempting for young people to drift away from the subjects that would be in their best interests.’ Schools Minister Nick Gibb said: ‘Children only have one chance at education. These tables show which schools are letting children down. Heads should be striving to make improvements year on year, and we will not let schools coast with mediocre performance. ‘We are driving up standards right across the board.’ Leap in results: Trevor Dunn, principal of Fyndoune Community School in County Durham, which was the most improved in the country . 2011’s bottom school was St Aldhelm’s Academy in Poole, Dorset (left), which saw just 3% of its 115 candidates gain five GCSEs at grades C and above. The most improved school was Fyndoune Community College (right) in Sacriston, Durham. Last year, 80% of pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grade C and above, compared with just 26% in 2008 . The figures showed that 45.6 per cent of ‘medium’ achievers – almost 120,000 – who reached the standard expected of their age in national curriculum tests aged 11 failed to get five good grades in subjects including English and maths. More than 2,800 of the nation’s 3,000 schools had fewer than half their pupils gaining the EBacc standard as well. Teenagers at selective schools were almost five times as likely to achieve the EBacc than pupils in comprehensives. The figures were 68.1 per cent and 13.7 per cent respectively, according to data released by the Department for Education. At Woodford County High School for Girls, in Woodford Green, Essex, pupils followed a traditional curriculum long before the EBacc was announced in September 2010. Headmistress Jo Pomeroy said: ‘We are a selective school and have very bright, motivated students. We have for some time run a curriculum with a very academic focus. It’s not a response we made to the English Baccalaureate. We did maintain a modern foreign language when the compulsion to do so was removed.’ The bottom school in the 2011 results was St Aldhelm’s Academy in Poole, Dorset.

"Zoila Leiva was four-and-a-half months pregnant and looking forward to having twins when she received some terrible news - she had breast cancer. But the 42-year-old from Whittier in California, refused to have an abortion and was able to battle back to health and keep her precious sons despite undergoing chemotherapy. She spoke to Mail Online on the day doctors reported in The Lancet that pregnant women with breast cancer can be treated safely and don't need to delay treatment until they give birth. Rocky road: Zoila had four rounds of chemotherapy during her pregnancy after refusing to abort her twins . The team from Belgium's Leuven Cancer Institute found chemotherapy can be . safely given in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy without affecting the unborn baby and, in . general, surgery is safe during any of the three trimesters. The advice given to Ms Leiva, who was diagnosed back in 2007 was very different. She had first felt a lump in her breast in February of that year but had been told it was a benign cyst following a mammogram and ultrasound. However, in December she was told it was actually cancer and she faced a terrible decision of life and death. She told Mail Online: 'My oncologist recommended an abortion straight away as my cancer was advanced and had spread to the lymph nodes. 'They told me there was no way of knowing if it had spread into any organs while I was pregnant as I couldn't have any of the necessary scans. 'They wanted me to have a termination within two weeks but after hearing about the procedure I was horrified. I could feel my babies moving. I thought ""I'll just die of depression if I kill them now."" 'So I never went back to that medical practice.' Relief: Julian (top) and Joel (bottom) only spent two weeks in hospital before they reached the 5lb and were allowed to go home . Aided by the cancer support network Hope For Two, Ms Leiva went to see a series of experts including obstetrician Dr Elyce Cardonick who told her that she could have cancer treatment while pregnant - especially as she was past her first trimester. She began a course of chemotherapy at the Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. But she was still able to enjoy her teenager daughter's Cinderella-themed birthday celebration with a full head of hair. 'The stylist pulled off a miracle as it all fell out the next day,' she said. She had four rounds of chemotherapy over 12 weeks, while also taking the drug Herceptin. By the time she was ready to give birth at  the recommended 32 weeks the tumour had shrunk to almost nothing. Ms Leiva said she had three specialist doctors on hand during her C-section as they were worried her sons would weigh as little as 2lbs. However, however when they were born in April 2008 Julian was 4lbs 3oz while Joel was 3lbs 12oz. 'They were strong healthy boys,' Ms Leiva, who is a manager at a brake systems company, said. 'The doctors had told me they could be in intensive care for five weeks but they were ready to come home in two weeks!' Zoila Leiva: 'Cancer doesn't have to be a death sentence' Fighting fit: Joel (left) and Julian enjoy opening their presents during Christmas 2011. Zoila says she is thankful every day for the gift of life . Now Ms Leiva's treatment could continue in earnest. She had a further 10 rounds of chemotherapy using a more toxic combination of drugs. Thankfully the disease had not spread to any of her vital organs. When her sons were six-months-old she had a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction. When her chemotherapy finished in January 2009, Mrs Leiva was ecstatic to be told she was in remission. However, she still had to undergo two months radiotherapy treatment and continued to take Herceptin until November 2010. Ms Leiva has now been clear of the disease for three years and says she is enjoying every day she gets to spend with her sons. 'They are four years old now and little terrors!' she joked. 'They are full of energy and they are excited about starting (a junior form of baseball) Tee Ball this Saturday.' My miracles: Zoila was relieved to find the cancer hadn't spread to her organs while she was carrying her babies . In the UK, 5,000 women of reproductive age are affected by breast cancer every year. Of . all cases diagnosed in women aged 30 or under, 10 to 20 per cent take . place during pregnancy or in the first year after a birth. Breast cancer in pregnant women is . generally diagnosed later than usual because symptoms . are obscured by expected changes to the body such as an increase in . cup-size. Frederic Amant a doctor from  Belgium's Leuven Cancer Institute who worked on The Lancet report, said: 'The new . insights we gained during our research facilitate cancer treatment and . provide hope for mother and child in most cases. 'Most mothers feel stronger and are even . more motivated to undergo the cancer treatment and its side effects, . since she is fighting for her child as well.' But Dr Amant admitted that breast cancer in pregnancy 'remains challenging' because in some situations advanced cancer can . lead to death of mother and baby. The report said women and their partners . should be informed about the treatment available, and . that termination of pregnancy did not seem to improve maternal outcome. But it said 'the decision to continue or end the pregnancy is a personal one'. Ms Leiva said she was keen to tell these women that they did have options. 'I want women to know that there is hope and that they can save their lives and that of the babies as well,' she said. 'Cancer doesn’t have to be a death sentence.'","Zoila first told she had a benign cyst 10 months before breast cancer diagnosis .

"A TV sketch show that likens Margaret Thatcher to fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter and depicts the Queen Mother as a foul-mouthed drunk has been branded ‘hideous’, ‘savage’ and ‘beyond the acceptable bounds of satire’. Historian Andrew Roberts, former Minister John Redwood and Royal biographer Penny Junor are among those who have condemned the comedy series Psychobitches. In one sequence, Lady Thatcher – played by Doctor Who star Michelle Gomez – vomits at the suggestion that every human being has an innate value. The comedy sketch show Psychobitches has been branded 'hideous' after likening Margaret Thatcher to fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter . In one sequence, Lady Thatcher – played by Doctor Who star Michelle Gomez – vomits at the suggestion that every human being has an innate value . In another, the Queen Mother, played by Kathy Burke, is shown verbally abusing her daughter Princess Margaret and then swigging from a magnum of champagne. The scenes are from the upcoming second series of the show in which The Thick Of It star Rebecca Front plays a psychiatrist treating some of the world’s most famous women. Front’s first meeting with Lady Thatcher takes place in an underground prison cell familiar to anyone who has seen the Oscar-winning 1991 film The Silence Of The Lambs. The former Prime Minister is wheeled in on a trolley wearing a mask just like the one worn by Hannibal Lecter. Burke’s Queen Mother tells Princess Margaret, played by The League of Gentlemen star Reece Shearsmith, that she would rather spend time with her bookmaker than with her youngest daughter, whom she calls a ‘dirty b****’. In another scene, the Queen Mother, played by Kathy Burke, is shown verbally abusing her daughter Princess Margaret and then swigging from a magnum of champagne . Friends of Lady Thatcher last night described the portrayal of the former Tory leader, who died last year, as upsetting to both her family and everyone who voted for her. Mr Roberts, a trustee of The Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust, said: ‘Margaret Thatcher was used to being traduced throughout her life and was never affected by it. 'But the sheer savagery of this goes beyond the acceptable bounds of satire.’ Tory MP Mr Redwood said: ‘I think this depiction would have been hurtful to her if she was still alive and it is certainly hurtful to her family and to the rest of us who supported her.’ Royal biographer Ms Junor said the portrayal of the Queen Mother was untrue. She added: ‘This sounds hideous to me and not remotely funny or even remotely true. I just think it’s nasty.’","Psychobitches has been branded 'beyond the acceptable bounds of satire'

"How I felt for the elegant Julia Roberts and Emma Thompson at the Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday. Both arrived in teetering Christian Louboutin heels, and both left in bare feet, clutching their heels in their hands. I'd hazard a guess that, however glamorous the after-show parties, they couldn't wait to get home and soak their aching, swollen feet. For the fact is, after a certain age high heels can feel as painful as someone sticking hot pins into the soles of your feet. Sore point: Emma Thompson ditched her heels at the Golden Globes . Julia Roberts stands tall on the red carpet... but also left without her heels on . I should know: I may still make my living as a model, but these days you're more likely to find me in a pair of moccasins or my bare feet than you are in a stiletto. When I do wear heels, I prefer to only wear them to dinner, where I'll be sitting down most of the time. It's funny really, because in my 20s I practically lived in heels. My young feet just seemed tougher than they are now. I'm in my 60s now and these feet have been around a long time. For me, my 50s was the decade when my tolerance for heels faded. I'm in good shape and, at 8st 3lb, I'm still the same weight I was in my 30s, but as you get older the weight of your body shifts somehow. Standing in heels just felt increasingly unnatural, and increasingly uncomfortable - something I'm now unwilling to tolerate. Beauty is pain: Marie is a fan of heels but hates how sore they can make her feet . It doesn't help that heels have, year on year, got ever higher.  But don't get me wrong - I think heels make most women look great. We all want to make our legs look the best they possibly can, and there's barely a woman alive whose legs don't look longer and leaner in a high-heeled shoe. So if you're an older lady like me who wants to stand tall occasionally, how can you wear heels late into the night? Lucky for you, I have some top tips on how to make high heels wearable, gleaned from my years of working in fashion. 1. I've slipped enough times over the years to know the peril of a too-smooth sole, so every time I buy a new pair I take a pair of scissors or a piece of sandpaper to the bottoms to roughen them up. In my catwalk days, I even used to spit on the soles of shoes before I ventured down the runway. Another of my girlfriends uses a particularly tacky hairspray. Anything to give them a bit more grip. 2. I like to give my shoes a test drive once I get home, no matter how silly it feels to be walking round in stilettoes in your pyjamas. That way you can work out which bits of the shoe rub your feet. Then you stick fabric plasters on the painful bits of your feet, briefly soak them in water before slipping straight back into your shoes and walking around again. Strutting her stuff: Marie has picked up some tricks on walking in heels from her years as a catwalk model . This will let your shoes mould and stretch out over the expanded damp plaster area. When you do wear your shoes next, they shouldn't rub. 3. If you've got a long night on heels ahead of you then warm up beforehand - standing on a four-inch heel is like a workout for legs. Hamstring stretches and ankle rotations can help prepare your legs for what's coming. For me, it's pretty much a habit - I do it most of the time while I'm sitting down. The great news, of course, is that if you're out to dinner you can do some under the table and no one will be any the wiser. 4. Wobble when you try to walk your heels? If you're not wearing open-toed shoes, why not tape your third and fourth toes along from your big toe together? This will keep foot muscles aligned, which allows the ball of your foot to be much steadier. Try it and see. 5. Spray your feet with deodorant beforehand to stop sweating and increase friction, which will help avoid those dreaded blisters. Another top tip is to use a nail file to rub away any rough edges inside your shoes and coat them with a thin layer of Vaseline. This will avoid any nasty sharp edges rubbing and causing you pain or blisters later on. 6. If you do develop blisters, then soak your feet for ten minutes in a warm bath with Epsom salts. Tip: Soaking feet in Epsom salts can toughen up the skin . It will toughen up the skin and the salt also acts as an antiseptic, killing bacteria and reducing your chances of developing an infection. Some people use warm black tea to do the same, but that seems to me a waste of a good drink. One thing I do if I get home and my feet hurt a bit is to take my hand and place it between each toe to separate them out, particularly if I’ve been wearing heels with a very pointed toe. It seems to relax them. I’m also a fan of Voltorol, an anti-inflammatory gel, to soothe aches and pains. 7. Buy rubber grips to stick on the soles of your shoes, even your fanciest ones. They cost very little - I buy them in bulk online, although you can get a cobbler to fit them - and I find that sticking one to the widest part of my shoe helps give me more stability. Christian Louboutin would be horrified if he knew, of course, as he is known for his stylish red soles. But they're on every single shoe I own. 8. Always find your shoes feel tight by the end of the evening? Use a man's shoe tree to stretch them out. This should provide a little extra wriggle room. 9. Don't be scared of cushioning. The padding on the skin of your feet gets thinner with age, which is why the older you get, the less tolerant your feet are to wearing heels. I use stick-in foot cushions to give extra support, and also to stop my foot from sliding forward in your shoes. And while they're not exactly sexy, cushioned tights can help, too. Marks & Spencer do a decent range. I also find shoes with a platform sole much more comfortable than thin ones. 10. You need to spend time finding the right heels for you - see it as a project. Never ever buy shoes on the spur of the moment, because they'll rarely be right once you get them home. I always go shoe shopping in the afternoon, when I've been on my feet for a few hours and they've swollen a little. That way you won't find that your shoes get tighter as the day goes on.","Model, now in her 60s, has learnt how to wear heels more comfortably .

"A young mother was beheaded in front of her two-and-a-half year old son in an horrific elevator accident in her block of flats near Moscow. Olga Tilinina, 20, was with her eldest child Maxim after taking him for a walk. She entered the lift on the ground floor with her son behind her when the elevator doors suddenly slammed shut. Her legs were trapped between the doors, say neighbours. 'Scene from hell': 20-year-old Olga Tilinina (left) was decapitated in front of her toddler son Maxim (right) when she became trapped in the doors of an out-of-control elevator at her block of flats near Moscow . Horrific: Mrs Tilinina (left) entered the lift on the ground floor with her son behind her when the elevator doors (pictured, right, after the accident) suddenly slammed shut as it rose to the next floor . The Russian mother pushed her son to safety but the lift then went up with her jammed half in-half out of the rising elevator. Her head cracked against the ceiling of the lift doorway. Olga was literally torn to pieces and 'her head was found on the ground floor, while the rest of her body was squeezed between the floors' before the elevator finally came to a halt on the second floor, said a report by television channel NTV. A family friend named Mikhail said: 'She had come back home, and was about to enter the lift with her child, but the door closed. Dicing with death: Minutes earlier, Olga's husband Dmitry (left), 24, had used the same lift to take the couple's other child Egor, one, in from their family walk . 'I have lost my most beloved and darling person': Mrs Tilinina with her husband Dmitry who plans to sue the company managing the apartment block for alleged negligence . 'She managed to push away her child, then her legs were caught, and the upper part of her body was crushed on the concrete. 'She was terribly badly damaged. A mess in her stomach, all mangled and smashed, her face mashed.' An emergency services worker said: 'Her poor son witnessed this scene from hell.' Minutes earlier Olga's husband Dmitry, 24, had used the same lift to take the couple's other child Egor, one, in from their family walk. When a traumatised Maxim was reunited with his shell-shocked father, all he could say was 'Mama, leg.' Stunning: Mrs Tilinina had been a contestant in a beauty contest in their home town of Dmitrov in 2012 . In a tribute to his dead wife, who in 2012 had been a contestant in a beauty contest in their home town of Dmitrov, he wrote on her social site: 'I have lost my most beloved and darling person. 'I love you and remember you, you will remain in my heart. Our children love you.' The grief-stricken husband said: 'I just can't understand how this could happen. 'Normally you push the doors and they open but instead it snapped shut, trapping her legs, and kept moving, dragging her up. 'And our elder son saw all this. He is just two and a half. He came into our apartment and said: 'Mama, leg.' He said: 'Olga was the love of my life, she gave me two children. She was just 20, and now we have buried her.' He insisted he would now devote his life to raising their sons. 'I have two little children to look after. I will take care of them myself, I won't give them to anyone, I will raise them for Olga's memory,' he said. The widower stressed: 'Olga and I had such great plans for our life. Now I will do all this myself, for her sake.' He plans to sue the company managing the apartment block for negligence. Experts are examining the damaged Soviet-era elevator. Mechanics had attended the elevator hours before the tragedy, it  has been disclosed. 'We are waiting for the results of the experts' opinion now,' he said. 'Nobody will give me back my wife, but the moral damages will let me look after our children for the future.' 'I will raise them for Olga': Dmitry Tilinin insisted he would now devote his life to bringing up their sons . A probe led by the local branch of Russia's Investigative Committee - equivalent of the FBI - is underway. 'Policemen found remains of the 20-year-old  young woman squeezed between the ceiling and the doors of the lift,' said a statement. 'Investigators have questioned the residents of this block, relatives of the victim, and removed all technical documents on the condition of this lift. 'Technical experts will check its functioning. When all the results are gathered, a decision on how to proceed will be made.' One neighbour said: 'There have been complaints about this lift for years.'","Olga Tilinina got wedged in doors when they suddenly slammed shut .

"Moira Wilson is accused of failing to alert authorities when a pregnant teenager arrived at the abortion clinic she ran with a much older man . A nursing manager did not contact social services after a pregnant teenager turned up with a ‘white van man’ asking for an abortion, a hearing was told. Moira Wilson failed to act after a series of incidents at the clinic in Birmingham where she worked between April 2010 and March 2011, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. Wilson is accused of not contacting social services after the 'really weird' scenario unfolded at the Calthorpe family planning clinic in Edgbaston that she managed at the time. Justine Norman, a disciplinary investigation officer, told the hearing a pregnant 14-year-old had turned up asking for a termination. She said the girl was accompanied by an adult man who did not appear to be a family relation. Miss Norman said: ‘This was a really weird scenario - a child turning up with a bloke in his 40s in a white van. ‘This incident was quite memorable and quite shocking.' She added: ‘It was quite shocking in the disciplinary meeting because I remember that we gave you every opportunity to suggest that you would do things differently if you were presented with the same situation. ‘It was specifically asked if you knew that this child was known to Social Services, would you do the same again, and you replied ""Yes"".’ While the clinic's policy was to have . key staff trained in child protection, with one member of staff . allocated for patients under 16, it was extremely unusual to see a child . patient, the hearing was told.

Norman added: ‘The business as a whole wasn’t set up to deal with . children - this was an adult service which occasionally had children . going through it.’ Moira Wilson denied ever seeing the 'white van man' who arrived at the abortion clinic with the 14-year-old girl. She said: 'I did not meet the girl before she arrived in the theatre suite and at no time did I see the man in the van. 'When I did meet the girl she was in a very upset state and she told me not to ask her questions. 'In . respect of my not contacting social services, in retrospect, following . the training that I had, I would have been in a better position to have . made a different decision' It is claimed Wilson's colleague Gayle Clark told her to call social services after the pregnant girl turned up with an older man. Tania Dosoruth, for the NMC, said: ''Mrs Clarke has said that Ms Wilson had knowledge of the patient at a much earlier stage. The teenager arrived in a white van with an older man at the abortion clinic, a hearing was told (file picture) 'When the concern was raised of that conversation between Mrs Clark and Ms Wilson, then, at that point, the referral should have been made. 'It is not disputed that Mrs Clark was the person at that point who had had spoken to the patient and come to the conclusion that this adult male wasn't a relative. 'It was then that Ms Wilson should have raised that concern.' Wilson said: 'As I think I think I have already said, I don't know why the girl was known to Social Services, whether it was because of this pregnancy or because of previous family matters. 'I don't know and I have no way of knowing what happened to the girl following her procedure.  That is all I want to say.' The . panel also heard that when another patient had kicked aggressively at . members of staff, Wilson did not complete a critical incident form, . interview staff members or advise senior management of the incident. A . further charge that Wilson allowed a patient to be visible through a . porthole window in a state of undress while in the operating theatre, . failing to respect their dignity, was dropped due to insufficient . evidence.

"As a devoted fan of Liverpool and the rise of ‘soccer’ in America, you might expect Paul Dalglish — son of Liverpool legend Kenny and manager of Texas-based second division club Austin Aztex — to have mixed feelings about Steven Gerrard deciding to leave Anfield and head for MLS. Instead, Dalglish Jnr believes Gerrard is leaving Liverpool at the right time to protect his legacy, and thinks the 34-year-old will love the anonymity for him and his family, wife Alex and their three daughters, after living his entire life in the goldfish bowl of his home city. Although no official announcement has been made about his next club, Dalglish says: ‘LA Galaxy would be perfect for Steven at this stage of his career and I fully expect that is where he will go. LA Galaxy and Steven Gerrard would be a perfect fit, according to Austin Aztecs manager Paul Dalglish . Liverpool's captain stretches with Jordan Henderson (left) and Emre Can (centre) at Melwood . Gerrard recently revealed he decided to quit Liverpool after a conversation with Brendan Rodgers . ‘He will love that he will be able to go for a meal with his family and nobody will know who he is. Not nobody, but very few people will know he is in L.A. because it is not a football city.’ Dalglish has been in America for eight years, winning two MLS titles as a player with Houston Dynamo and now working as a coach. He says Gerrard will love the lifestyle but is not in for a holiday, particularly with the travelling and weather players have to contend with. ‘What he will find is it can be a grind over here. A lot of Premier League teams suffer when they play in the Champions League and then have to travel back and play at the weekend. In MLS, that happens every other week. ‘A lot of players like LA because the climate is consistent, it’s not extreme. It’s a good fit for Steven, they have money to spend after the retirement of Landon Donovan, and I am sure I will bump into him and have a beer.’ Gerrard's most likely destination is LA Galaxy, where former team-mate Robbie Keane (centre) currently plays .

"West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino is at the centre of more controversy after being filmed inhaling the legal but potentially deadly ‘hippy crack’ drug through a balloon. The England Under 21 forward repeatedly sucked up nitrous oxide, also known as ‘laughing gas’, inside his parked car before slumping at the wheel hours after his team had lost 3-0 to Manchester United. A female friend is heard to say, ‘Are you f*****?’ and then: ‘Do you not think you’ve had enough?’. Later Berahino is asked, ‘What is up with you dude?’ as he stares into the camera. No laughing matter: Saido Berahino inhales nitrus oxide, also known as 'laughing gas' or 'hippy crack' Controversial: Saido Berahino (left) has been filmed inhaling laughing gas . West Brom have been 2-0 up inside 11 minutes four times this season but failed to win each game. Nitrous oxide is popular on the party scene and users say it creates feelings of euphoria and light-headedness. Some even experience hallucinations. But drug advice website Frank warns ‘there is a risk of death as a lack of oxygen can occur’ and adds: ‘This risk is likely to be greater if the gas is consumed in an enclosed space.’ Danny Lee-Frost, of the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, has said: ‘The rush users experience is caused by starving the brain of oxygen. The long-term dangers to health include bone marrow suppression, blood cell problems and poisoning of the central nervous system.’ Berahino, 20, was partying at trendy Nuvo bar in Birmingham city centre on March 8 when the video was taken, according to the Sunday Mirror. He has issued an apology for his actions and insisted he will not use the drug again. He has also been reprimanded by West Brom. Talent: Berahino (centre) took part on West Brom's 3-3 Premier League draw with Tottenham on Saturday . Berahino said: ‘This was very poor judgement on my part and not the right example to be setting. At the time, I wasn’t fully aware of the serious health risks involved but now I know, I won’t be doing it again.’ Richard Garlick, the club’s sporting and technical Director, added: ‘I have spoken to Saido about the incident and told him in no uncertain terms that his conduct is not befitting a West Bromwich Albion player. Saido knows he has made a mistake. He has apologised for his actions and has assured the club it will not happen again.’ Berahino is not the first Premier League footballer caught using the drug. Kyle Walker apologised after being pictured inhaling ‘hippy crack’ through a balloon last year. Sorry: Berahino has issued an apology for his actions and insists he will not use 'hippy crack' again . Dangerous: Nitrous oxide is a legal, but potentially deadly drug also known as 'hippy crack' Berahino burst onto the scene this season and was rewarded with a huge wage rise from £850-per-week to £12,000 after interest from Chelsea and Arsenal. But he is out of the starting line-up at the moment and was allegedly punched by James Morrison a fortnight ago after giving the ball away late on against Cardiff leading to a damaging equaliser. In the week after that match head coach Pepe Mel praised Berahino for his ‘intelligence’ but his antics now cast a shadow over such claims. Previous: Spurs right back Kyle Walker has also been caught using 'hippy crack' Mel said then: ‘I spoke to Saido - he perhaps seems to be more responsible than other people of his age and I told him that I trust him and trust he will continue to work well.’ Berahino came on as a 71st minute substitute in the 3-3 draw with Tottenham and appeared to have learnt his lesson by heading for the corners when in possession late on at 3-2. On Friday he appeared in philosophical mood, writing on Twitter: ‘Life is too short to start your day with broken pieces of yesterday, it will destroy your wonderful today and ruin your great tomorrow.’ Backing: Baggies boss Pepe Mel (pictured) has recently spoken of his trust in Berahino .","Saido Berahino sucks up nitrous oxide inside his car .

"When Wrexham's Joe Clarke leads his non-League team out at Stoke City on Sunday, he will give silent thanks to his famous pal Adam Johnson who allowed him to live like a Premier League king rent-free in Cristiano Ronaldo's mansion when his future as a full-time professional was very much in the balance. Back in 2011, Clarke's career was at a crossroads. Having started out at the bottom of the football pyramid with Evesham Town, Redditch United and Solihull Moors, a move up to the Conference with Darlington hadn't worked out and he was forced to try out at Wrexham without a guaranteed salary. He couldn't afford to pay the petrol for the daily 160-mile round trip from his home in the West Midlands to north Wales, and was indebted when Johnson, then of Manchester City, invited him to lodge with him in Ronaldo's palatial five-bedroom home in Alderley Edge, complete with indoor swimming pool, steam room, jacuzzi, gym and wine area. Joe Clarke was all smiles as he sat down to talk to Sportsmail about his eventual last few years in the game . The 26-year-old is set to face Premier League opposition in the shape of Stoke in the FA Cup on Sunday . 'Adam was renting the house and was very generous letting me stay there,' explains Clarke. 'I was able to go into training at Wrexham happy and it paid off because I got the contract, I've been there four years and now we've got this great FA Cup third round game to look forward to.' Once inside the gates, Clarke says life was pretty normal, though there was one giveaway sign about the identity of the famous owner. 'All of Ronaldo's stuff had been moved out. The only way you could tell it was his were the handles of the doorknobs and chests of drawers had the number seven engraved into them. 'I didn't pay rent — I wouldn't have been able to afford to pay the proper going rate — but I helped out in the garden and with other stuff.' Clarke, 26, got to know 'Johnno' through Everton's Gareth Barry, a mutual friend who was also at City at the time, and the pair hit it off as golf and music enthusiasts. Clarke opens up to Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein about how his close friend Adam Johnson helped him out . Adam Johnson - seen here after scoring against Manchester City - is a close friend of Clarke's . On Sunday afternoon, the spotlight will be on Clarke, who gave up carpentry to play football and believes he may have two or three years to achieve his Football League dream. 'I've got a lot of energy. I try to get in both boxes, break up play and keep it simple, and then go on the occasional crazy run,' he explains. 'A lot of Premier League sides don't fancy going to Stoke but for us it's a chance to test yourself against top players. They make the game look easy on the telly, so you want to put yourself in the situation and see how you deal with it. 'We've had experience of playing in front of 35,000 at Wembley in the FA Trophy final so we don't have to feel overawed. There isn't any pressure on us.' It's a huge day for Wrexham, who fell on hard times and were saved from extinction in 2011 when fans raised £127,000 to stop them being kicked out of the Conference. Clarke lodged in a house rented out by Cristiano Ronaldo to Johnson when his career was in the balance . Now fan-owned, they boast an FA Cup-winner in director of football operations Barry Horne, one of Everton's Dogs of War who helped beat Manchester United in 1995. 'I know (Stoke manager) Mark Hughes, he was a Wales team-mate of mine, and he won't be taking anything for granted,' Horne says. Twenty-three years after Wrexham caused an FA Cup sensation by beating league champions Arsenal with Mickey Thomas's goal, the Red Dragons have the taste for another upset. It might be too much to ask for some of Ronaldo's magic to rub off on Clarke, but you never know. 'I've seen that Luke Shaw is renting the house now. It was good to see a picture of it on Twitter and think 'I stayed there,' he smiles.","It could have been so different for Joe Clarke had he not had the help of his friend Adam Johnson when his career was in the balance in 2011 .

"A Rotherham child abuse victim has told how her attacker warned she would be killed if she refused to have an abortion at the age of 14 (file image, victim not pictured) A Rotherham child abuse victim has told how her attacker warned she would be killed if she refused to have an abortion -  at the age of 14. The woman, now in her 30s, revealed how she then fell pregnant to the same abuser for the second time just six months later and on that occasion was allowed to keep the child. Her story comes as it was revealed that as many as 100 teenage girls may have had babies after falling pregnant to their abusers. According to the Sunday Mirror, the victim, known only as Jane, was targeted as a schoolgirl in Rotherham while she was living with her parents. She described how her attacker, who was in his 20s, was driving around in his car looking for potential victims when he saw her in the street. After 'chatting her up' and buying her food and clothes, Jane admitted she felt 'flattered' by the attention. In the weeks that followed he would sneak in through her bedroom window and have sex with her while her parents slept in the next room. She told the newspaper that she found out she was pregnant while she was at school - but on telling her attacker, he ordered her to get rid of the baby. 'He told me they would do a DNA test and he would be jailed. He said his friends would find me and kill me.' Despite her desperate parents informing social services, she claims no action was taken. 'I had the abortion and I was put in care to keep us apart. He would drive up and down outside my home. It was like he was stalking me.' Just six months later, and living with foster parents, the abuser tracked her down and she fell pregnant again at the age of 15. The man allowed her to keep the baby provided she became a Muslim and describes having to 'eat what he did. No bacon, and he talked to me about his religion for hours.' The pair lost contact for two years while her abuser was in jail for attacking another man. It was only years later that Jane was told by a social worker that she had been abused and learnt that she had not been his only victim. She told the Sunday Mirror that during her ordeal she was failed twice by police who did not investigate her abuse. Jane's story comes as it was revealed that as many as 100 teenage girls in Rotherham, pictured, may have had babies after being made pregnant by their abusers. The newspaper says more than 100 teenagers may have conceived during rapes. Jane's story comes after an explosive report which revealed child sexual exploitation in the town had an 'absolutely devastating' effect on the estimated 1,400 victims between 1997 and 2013. Professor Alexis Jay's report also highlighted another tragic element of the scandal for some of the victims who fell pregnant - being separated from the babies born as a result. It said: 'In a number of cases we read, children and young people had pregnancies, miscarriages and terminations. The wholesale sexual exploitation of young girls is going on in 'every town and village' in the country, says the author of the Rotherham sex abuse report. Professor Alexis Jay, the expert who laid bare the gang-rapes of hundreds of children by predators there, has issued a chilling warning that thousands more are at risk. She says young girls were still being groomed, threatened and raped in 'every town and village' across the country. The former inspector of Scotland's social workers was speaking after her damning report which sent shock waves throughout Britain. She revealed at least 1,400 children in Rotherham - some as young as 11 - were raped systematically by gangs of Asian men. Professor Alexis Jay, the expert who laid bare the gang-rapes of hundreds of children by predators there, has issued a chilling warning that thousands more are at risk . But she warned: 'There is no question that this is still happening and will carry on because there is a demand for sex with children. 'It is happening in every town and village in the country.' Prof Jay suggested a national legal requirement for local authorities and the police to report child sexual exploitation. She said: 'It would certainly help to place the scale of the problem across the country because at this time, we simply don't know.' Hundreds were raped by predatory men after being groomed and showered with gifts of booze and drugs. Professor Jay said: 'It was not that they didn't care but they were utterly overwhelmed by what was going on and they didn't get the support they needed. 'I have a huge amount of sympathy with the efforts the parents were making but in many instances, these children were distressed. 'There were threats against their families if they didn't let their girls go out and be exploited by these groups of men.' Last night, Rotherham's Labour MP Sarah Champion said one of the most upsetting aspects of the scandal was that babies born to some victims were taken away and were never seen by their mothers again. She said: 'That speaks volumes about the way these children weren't seen as victims at all.' 'Some had children removed under care orders, and suffered further trauma when contact with their child was terminated and alternative family placements found. 'This affected not just the victims themselves, but other siblings who had developed attachments to the baby. 'However, there were other cases where vulnerable and sometimes very young mothers were able, with appropriate long-term support, to recover and successfully care for their children.' It comes as it was revealed there were up to 24 lost chances to halt child abuse in Rotherham. The Sunday Times reports that there were 'at least' 24 child protection investigations in the South Yorkshire town that failed to prevent the abuse. The newspaper says that the Professor Jay's report reveals the number of inspections of Rotherham child services since 2002. Organisations that conducted the reviews included, among others, the Home Office, a number of charities, Ofsted and the Social Services Inspectorate. Meanwhile, the Sun has reported that police are preparing to take re-examine 'at least' a thousand complaints of sex abuse in the town. The newspaper reports that police officers from other forces could be brought in to take a fresh look at cases from as far back as 1997.","Child abuse victim reveals how she became pregnant twice by same attacker .

"Queensland police will deploy so-called 'sonic cannon' devices at the G20 at the weekend, although they insist they will not be used as a 'force option'. According to a Fairfax Media report, police currently own two Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) models, which are capable of blasting clear sound in a fixed direction for up to two kilometres. G20 protest organisers said they were baffled several weeks ago when police offered to show them the 'ludicrous' hardware at a police training academy. Scroll down for video .

'We just thought it was bizarre,' said Adrian Skerritt, the spokesman for the BrisCAN group, which is expecting several thousand protesters to turn out for a rally on Saturday. Mr Skerritt said the device was 'absolutely silly'. 'It's a ludicrous thing, that they have such a vehicle.... It won't be used. They know it won't be used.' A police spokesman described the devices as 'acoustic hailing devices' and said they are regularly used by negotiators. 'The devices may be used at G20 for communication with large crowds,' the spokesman told Daily Mail Australia. 'Under no circumstances will they be used as cannons or as a use of force option.

"The Greek Tourism Ministry's latest promotional video opens with  a call to the ancient world of the gods. 'Everywhere you turn,' it begins, 'Gods, myths, heroes.' And, it seems, the rugged coast of Australia. In an embarrassing case of plagiarism, or mistaken geography, the Ministry has claimed Australia's most recognisable natural wonders, the Twelve Apostles, as its own. Scroll down for video . The Greek Tourism Ministry has used timelapse footage of the Twelve Apostles by Australian photographer Alex Cherney in its recently launched 'Gods, Myths, Heroes' promotional video . As one section of the 'Gods, Myths, Heroes' video pans over the Twelve Apostles under a starry night sky, the English narrator tells how it is here that Aphrodite, goddess of love, lust and kindness, 'emerges from the waves.' 'When the day is done, the moon and her stars paint the sky in brilliant constellations, named from astrology by ancient sailors, navigating their way from island to island across the broad sea,' the narration continues. Melbourne-based photographer Alex Cherney discovered that the footage was his via social media, just his days after the Ministry launched the video at an international industry event. The shots were taken from his award-winning time-lapse film, Ocean Sky, which he says took a year and a half to pull together and 31 hours of filming over Australia's Southern Coastline. 'My video has been seen nearly 2 million times online since 2011, won some awards, and been featured as NASA's astronomy picture of the day, so that's probably why it was recognised,' he told Fairfax. Melbourne photographer Alex Cherney says it took 31 hours of filming over the Southern Ocean to create his award-winning time-lapse film, Ocean Sky, which has been used in the new Greek Tourism video . The Visit Greek video tells how the goddess of love, Aphrodite, was born from the waves as it pans over the Twelve Apostles in Australia's Sourthern Ocean . But when Cherney contacted the producer  Andonis Theocharis Kioukas, he was told the Greek Tourism Ministry had subsequently purchased the rights to use the footage from an agency representing Cherney. And it intended to continue to do so. In a translated response to criticism over the footage, the Ministry said the decision to use shots of the iconic Australian coastline and the milky way was a deliberate one because 'the mythology of the sky at all latitudes and longitudes of the Earth is Greek.' 'That almost all the world, wherever you turn around your eyes, you will meet an idea, a name, that originated from Greece,' the translation reads.  'Even the skies of Australia in the southern hemisphere, explains the artistic creator, when lift your eyes open, you will see stars and constellations that carry Greek names. The video, produced at a cost of $86,000, has also copped criticism for its use of Nazi propaganda footage from the opening ceremony of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The 12-minute video concludes with narrator saying the world must become small again 'as the old Greek world was.' 'Small enough to include everybody.' And, it would seem, all their landmarks.

"A couple in a race to raise £160,000 to fund their daughter's cancer care so that she can live to see Christmas have been told that she is too sick to fly to the U.S. for the life-saving treatment. Michelle and Sam Lea put their family home on the market in order to raise the money needed to treat their daughter, Frankie-Rose Lea, who has been given just weeks to live. The seven-year-old's tumour has tripled in size and spread to her spine since she started chemotherapy in August. Experts told Mr and Mrs Lea that their daughter's best chance of surviving is travelling to the U.S. for proton beam therapy. But last night Frankie-Rose's latest MRI scan showed that she has a build up on the brain and requires surgery early next week, according to a post on her Facebook page. It means that she can no longer make to journey to the American clinic. Michelle and Sam Lea, pictured with their sons Alfie, right and Freddie, left, have vowed to make their family homeless in a bid to raise £160,000 to fund life-saving cancer treatment for their daughter Frankie-Rose, centre, after she was diagnosed with a brain tumour . The couple have put their terraced home in Erith, Kent, left, on the market and are desperate to sell it within the week, to fund proton beam therapy treatment in the US. Since having chemotherapy Frankie's brain tumour has tripled in size and spread to her spine, leaving doctors to predict she won't live until Christmas . Mr and Mrs Lea had planned to cancel their August wedding, after Frankie-Rose, was diagnosed the same month. But the seven-year-old told her parents she was desperate to be a bridesmaid . Her family are now looking at taking the seven-year-old to Germany or Switzerland, where they can drive her to receive the proton therapy treatment. Applying for the treatment, sought by the family of Ashya King, on the NHS will take up to eight weeks - time Frankie-Rose does not have. Mr and Mrs Lea, who also have two sons, Alfie, 11, and Freddie, five, have put their three-bedroom home in Erith, Kent, on the market in a desperate bid to raise the £160,000 needed to fund the treatment. They said the terraced property is worth £220,000 but are marketing it at £170,000 to try and attract a cash buyer, to encourage a quick sale. In an incredible show of support for little Frankie-Rose, well wishers have pledged more than £140,000 through two fundraising pages set up by her family. Donations have been flooding in, and a second page has been set up to help accept money from the public. Doctors have told the family Frankie-Rose may not live until Christmas. To apply for proton beam therapy on the NHS takes around eight weeks - time the youngster doesn't have . But the family still need to raise a further £20,000 for treatment and travel in the next week - or lose their home in order to save the seven-year-old's life. Frankie-Rose Lea has been given just weeks to live, after doctors originally misdiagnosed an aggressive brain tumour as growing pains. Dinner lady Mrs Lea, 36, said yesterday, before the news of her latest MRI: 'We are desperate. Right now all we can think about is getting Frankie to America for the treatment she needs to survive. 'We will live in a box if we need to as long as we are together. 'We have worked hard, our house is all we have but we will sell it to save her. ‘Some people might criticise us for making the family homeless when we have two other children but I would rather do that than have to tell her brothers we let Frankie die. 'What choice do we have ? If we wait for NHS funding it will probably be too late.’ Frankie-Rose began complaining of pain in her legs in May this year. Mrs Lea said: ‘Frankie-Rose said her legs were aching, so I told her to rest. 'Like most kids her age she was always on the go but when it got worse I took her to the doctor who said it was just growing pain.’ Mrs Lea said: 'We will live in a box if we need to, as long as we are together. We have worked hard, our house is all we have but we will sell it to save her.' Frankie-Rose is pictured, right with a children's entertainer dressed up as Elsa from Frozen, at her seventh birthday party in August . But in the weeks that followed, Mrs Lea noticed her daughter falling over and bruises appearing on her legs. She went back to the GP and said she was told this time that Frankie-Rose was flat footed which was causing her balance problems. But unconvinced Mrs Lea took her daughter back again and says she was advised to take her for an eye test and again told it was growing pain. When her daughter’s pain got worse she arranged further visits and said on the sixth occasion she was annoyed to have been booked to see a locum GP. ‘I felt he wouldn’t know my daughter and made that clear,' she said. Proton beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision. The radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy X-rays, used in conventional radiotherapy. Unlike an X-ray, the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body. It enables therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely. The beam can be more finely controlled, in both its width and its depth, so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours, with less risk to healthy tissues. The treatment has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of many different tumours, including those found in the head and neck, eye, central nervous system, lung, prostate and gastrointestinal tract. The precision of the pencil beam scanning makes it especially beneficial in treating tumours adjacent to critical and sensitive organs, such as the eye, brain and spinal cord. Source: Mayo Clinic . 'But to my surprise he was the first to perform a basic neurological test by asking Frankie to follow his finger with her eyes. 'She couldn’t do it and he told me to get straight to hospital for an MRI scan.’ At Darent Valley Hospital in Kent, an MRI revealed a dangerous build up of fluid on the little girl’s brain and she was sent by ambulance to Kings College Hospital in London for urgent surgery the following morning. The operation on July 18 revealed a mass on her brain stem was causing the build up. Mrs Lea said: ‘I was shocked. You never think it will happen to you. 'But at the same time I had known all along it was something more serious than growing pains.' The following week a biopsy revealed the tumour was cancerous and on August 4 the devastated couple were told the rare nature of high grade Astrocytoma giloma’s in children made it hard to predict how she would respond to treatment. But the position on the brain stem made it impossible to operate on and medics hoped to stabilise it with chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy when she was older and her brain more developed. Mr and Mrs Lea were due to marry later that month on August 23 and Mrs Lea originally wanted to call off the wedding they had booked back in January but Frankie was desperate to be a bridesmaid. ‘We’d been so busy in hospital that I hadn’t arranged the cars or wedding shoes, it was the last thing on my mind but doctors advised us to go ahead with the wedding because Frankie was well enough and she was looking forward to it,’ Mrs Lea said. But first Frankie turned seven on August 15 and the family hastily arranged a huge party, not knowing if it would be her last. Two weeks later the couple married surrounded by family and friends.

Mrs Lea said: ‘It was all about her, there wasn’t a dry eye in the house because nobody knew what the future held. ‘She had lost some of her hair because of the surgery but she looked so beautiful.’ Doctors misdiagnosed Frankie'Rose's brain tumour as growing pains five times before her parents were told she was battling cancer . The family have also set up a fundraising page to raise money for Frankie-Rose's treatment . Frankie-Rose started chemotherapy two days later but suffered terrible side effects, including nausea, weight loss and a bleed on the brain.

"Returning Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has been warned he has to handle the pressure if he wants to be a success at Anfield. Mignolet is poised to make his first Liverpool start for three weeks on Monday night against Swansea having been axed by Rodgers following the club’s Champions League exit three weeks ago. The 26-year-old Belgian has faced heavy criticism this season but has won a reprieve because of a thigh injury picked up by rival keeper Brad Jones at Burnley on Boxing Day. VIDEO Scroll down to see Rodgers discuss the criticism received by Mignolet . Simon Mignolet will make his return to the Liverpool starting line-up following an injury to Brad Jones . Jones suffered a thigh injury and had to be replaced during Liverpool's 1-0 Boxing Day win at Burnley . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has told Mignolet he must learn to deal with the pressure . Rodgers is aware Mignolet will be under the spotlight after a nervy cameo as a substitute at Turf Moor which included misjudging a clearance so the ball ran over the goal-line for a corner. But the Liverpool boss says his players have little choice but to accept being under the spotlight at such a big club. ‘Like everyone, Simon has had a wee bit of flak. But to operate at this level, you have to be able to deal with that,’ said Rodgers. ‘He came on against Burnley and had a couple of edgy moments, and he will recognise that. But it will help his confidence to keep a clean sheet. That is what he wants as a goalkeeper and what we want as a team. ‘This is an opportunity for Simon to prove his worth.’ Mignolet fails to stop the ball crossing the line as Liverpool concede a goal at Queens Park Rangers . Mignolet is beaten by Ludogorets Razgrad player Dani Abalo during a Champions League encounter . At the other end, Raheem Sterling — currently playing as Liverpool’s main striker — has been set a target of scoring 15 goals this season by Rodgers. Sterling is filling in for Daniel Sturridge while Rickie Lambert, Mario Balotelli and Fabio Borini struggle for goals and scored the winner at Burnley for his sixth goal of the season, having netted 10 times last term. ‘He knows his job is to create goals and score goals and he’s doing very well at the moment,’ said Rodgers. ‘Between 10 and 15 would be a good return for him. The boy is a natural winger and if he gets those figures on a regular basis it’s a very good number for him. ‘You’ve other players who are out-and-out No 9s but as his career matures I think he will show he’s got that ability.’ Raheem Sterling celebrates after scoring Liverpool's match-winner in the Boxing Day win over Burnley . Sterling uses his pace to carry the ball past Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Turf Moor . The England international then places the ball into the net as Heaton and his defenders look on helplessly . Kolo Toure also believes Sterling will blossom into a top striker over the coming years — and stay at Anfield. Sterling has two-and-a-half years left on his current £35,000 per week deal but Liverpool have been in talks with his advisors about offering him improved terms to reward the outstanding progress he has made. There have been some reports that Liverpool’s offer is not what Sterling’s advisors feel he is worth, but Toure is not concerned. The Ivorian said: ‘I’ve been lucky to play with some of the best strikers in the world and I can say Raheem has all the qualities to be up there. Kolo Toure and Simon Mignolet shake hands after the goalkeeper was introduced for Brad Jones at Burnley . ‘Technically he has top quality. I don’t think the things being said about whether he will sign a new contract will affect him. I also don’t think it will be about money. Raheem will make a decision based on what he feels is right. ‘I think he will stay because he has been so well looked after at Liverpool.’ Monday night’s clash with Swansea will pit Rodgers against two players Liverpool might have signed — Gylfi Sigurdsson and Wilfried Bony. Swansea skipper Ashley Williams has also been linked with a move to Anfield and Rodgers said: ‘He is a top-class international centre half.’","Simon Mignolet will start in goal for Liverpool against Swansea City .

"Jeremy Clarkson avoided the sack during the infamous n-word row because he was 'absolutely remorseful' about any suggestion or hint the word had been used, the BBC director-general says. The Top Gear presenter caused outrage in May when unaired footage showed the 54-year-old reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before muttering what sounded like 'catch a n***** by his toe'. In subsequent days Clarkson took to Twitter to deny he used the offensive term, before releasing a video statement saying he was ‘mortified and horrified’ that it sounded like he had used racist language. Scroll down for video . BBC director-general Lord Tony Hall (pictured) is believed to have personally stepped in to prevent Clarkson from being sacked in the wake of the n-word incident in June . In a wide-ranging interview, Lord Tony Hall, the BBC director-general, has now revealed he had long discussions about the incident but Clarkson was not sacked after he apologised. He told The Times: 'We took it very seriously and we wanted to make sure the team knew what we thought about it. 'Nothing was broadcast, they were absolutely remorseful about any hint that they were saying or doing anything that was racist. He then added: 'There are millions of people who feel that that Top Gear... reflects them and their interests and we've got to respect that.' Clarkson uttered what sounded like the n-word during filming of the third episode of Top Gear series 19 as the star reviewed the £25,000 Toyota GT86 and the Subaru BRZ - which cost around the same amount. Telling viewers that they may find it difficult to differentiate between the two vehicles he demonstrated how to do it using the child's counting rhyme. The video clip caused outrage and there were widespread demands he should be sacked for what was his latest indiscretion in a series of scandals. A clip from the unaired footage which shows Clarkson reciting the counting rhyme during filming . Outspoken Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson has been involved in a string of controversies. Most recently, he and the Top Gear team were chased out of Argentina after angry locals reacted with fury to Clarkson's number plate containing an apparent reference to the Falklands War. The H982 FKL plate  was seen locally as a veiled reference to the 1982 conflict. However, the Top Gear denied their use of it was a deliberate reference to the war, and claimed it had simply been a coincidence. In July, Ofcom ruled Clarkson deliberately used racist language by referring to an Asian man as a 'slope' during a Burma special. The Indian High Commission in London formally complained to the BBC in 2012 about a special in which Clarkson travelled round India in a Jaguar with a toilet fixed to the boot. Clarkson was also reported to have referred to the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown as a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' in 2009. And the year before, the BBC received more than 500 complaints after he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes. Clarkson also made a mock Nazi salute while talking about a Mini design that might be 'quintessentially German' and received flak after describing those who jump in front of trains as 'Johnny Suicides'. Even deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman said 'anybody who used the word 'in whatever context' should have no place at the BBC. The BBC put the presenter on a final warning over the controversy and Clarkson wrote in his newspaper column that he believed he would be sacked by the broadcaster if he made another offensive remark. In his remorseful video statement, he said he was 'mortified' and 'horrified' the unused footage appeared to show him mumbling the word. He said: 'I was mortified by this, horrified, it is a word I loath. And I did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted. 'Please be assured I did everything in my power to not use that word. 'And as I'm sitting here begging your forgiveness for that fact that obviously my efforts weren't quite good enough.'","Top Gear presenter believed to have kept job following boss' intervention .

Joanne Dougherty from 1969 until 2002 (left, together in 2000) and then . married second wife Sharon in 2010 (right, at a White House State Dinner . in 2011) Before his suicide was confirmed, one friend told the Daily News that Jeffrey's battle with addition was a long one. 'There was not a mean thing about him. He was very spoiled, but he was not a brat,' the source said. 'He was such a great kid. He'd been in rehab so many times, crashed cars, everything. He was super-sensitive and very lost. He was lost in a complicated family.' Jeffrey Corzine spent time as a patient at Promises, a well-known rehab center in southern California and is survived by siblings Jennifer and Josh.

'My thoughts and prayers are with Governor Corzine, Joanne and the entire Corzine family on the tragic loss of Jeffrey. They are both devoted parents and the loss they have suffered is unthinkable,' Christie said. 'Mary Pat and I send our personal condolences and condolences on behalf of all the people of New Jersey to the Corzine family during these very sad times,' His Facebook page states that he attended the Pomfret School, a private boarding high school in Connecticut, and went on to study at New York University where he graduated in 2008.

"Burnley missed the chance to climb out of the bottom three as an unfortunate own goal from Kieran Trippier gave high-flying Swansea City the points. Jack Cork's 64th minute shot struck Trippier and crept over the line before goalkeeper Tom Heaton could scramble it clear to make it a seventh game without a win for Sean Dyche's side. The Clarets stayed in the relegation zone as a result, failing to capitalise on the team immediately above them, QPR, having a free Saturday. Burnley keeper Tom Heaton is unable to stop Kieran Trippier's unfortunate deflection crossing the line to make the score 1-0 to Swansea . Heaton dives desperately, but his final touch on the ball occurs after it has crossed the line and the goal stands . The Swansea players celebrate Trippier's own goal from Jack Cork's initial shot; it was enough to give them all three points . Burnley (4-2-3-1): Heaton 6; Trippier 6, Keane 7, Shackell 6, Mee 6; Arfield 5.5, Jones 5.5; Boyd 6, Barnes 6 (Jutkiewicz 90), Kightly 7 (Vokes 75); Ings 5.5 .

Click here for more stats, pitch maps and analysis in our brilliant MATCH ZONE . Ashley Barnes, criticised by Jose Mourinho last week for his 'criminal' tackle on Nemanja Matic was twice denied by excellent stops from Lukasz Fabianski while Burnley's appeals for a penalty against Federico Fernandez were waved away. As expected, Dyche named Barnes in his starting line-up despite last weekend's furore in which the player was blamed by Jose Mourinho for the tackle that led to Matic being sent off for retaliation. The huge cheer from Turf Moor's faithful when Barnes' name was read out over the tannoy before kick off showed clearly where their loyalties lie. Aiming to build on a creditable draw at Stamford Bridge, Burnley made their traditional fast start at home with George Boyd warming the hands of Fabianski. Swansea, missing playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson with a hamstring injury, were taken aback and unable to get their posession game going early on. Ashley Barnes looks on in despair as Trippier's deflection crosses the line - the Burnley defender can be seen (left) head in hands . Lukasz Fabianksi makes a terrific save from the shot of Barnes to keep the scores level at 0-0 in the first half . Former Arsenal shot-stopper Fabianski had an impressive afternoon; he kept a clean sheet to earn Swansea three points . When Wayne Routledge tried to get down the left with an electric burst, Michael Keane showed commitment to the cause with a perfectly-timed tackle with his outstretched leg. The first clear opportunity of the game fell to Barnes. He had a chance to become a real hero when a Danny Ings' shot deflected and spun into his path six yards out. Barnes turned sharply and hit it first-time well enough, but credit has to go for Fabianski who spotted the danger and came out of his goal quickly enough to spread himself and make a block. Michael Kightly then dribbled past two defenders before causing mayhem in the Swansea box as the hosts pressed purposefully for the first time around the half-hour mark. Barnes rises above the Swansea defence to direct a header towards goal at Turf Moor, but he is unable to put the Clarets ahead . Bafetimbi Gomis has been tasked with leading the line for Swansea after the exit of main main Wilfried Bony to Manchester City . George Boyd fires a shot past Neil Taylor from just inside the 18-yard box, but he was unable to put Burnley ahead at Turf Moor . Burnley have been spirited in their fight against relegation and haven't been cut adrift at the bottom as some people feared. Nevertheless without a win in six games, this was the type of fixture they needed to take advantage of to promote their hopes of staying up. Swansea's excellent season means they aren't in any danger of being sucked into the drop zone but their home form remains better than their results on the road, as suggested by last weekend's victory against Manchester United. The lethargic Bafetimbi Gomis suddenly burst, or rather ambled into life, to test Tom Heaton with a low drive from 18 yards, followed by a run onto Jonjo Shelvey's pass that he skied over. Swansea's tactical nous made it hard for Burnley who rarely showed the type of urgency you'd expect with less winnable fixtures coming up against Liverpool and Manchester City next. Whether it was the publicity from the last week, even Barnes didn't seem to have the same dynamism and aggression as we've seen in other games. Sean Dyche decided to do something about it by running to the edge of the pitch to kick the ball quickly back into play for a Burnley free-kick and maybe the urgency from the manager had an effect. In Burnley's next attack, Kightly cut in from the left and hit a shot that bounced off Fabianski's chest. Kightly skewed the rebound back into a crowded six-yard box where it hit Swansea defender Federico Fernandez on the arm.

Swansea captain Ashley Williams tries to calm down Fabianski as he speaks to referee Jon Moss at Turf Moor . Jonjo Shelvey (centre) celebrates his side's 1-0 win at Turf Moor - a result which takes Swansea above West Ham to eighth . Burnley's players appealed loudly for a penalty but referee Jonathan Moss ruled it was unintentional. It was probably the right call but you have seen them given. Barnes then controlled, turned and shot in one movement but was just wide after an hour. As often happens in football, Burnley then capped their best period of the match by conceding in the cruellest circumstances. From a corner, Heaton made a brilliant reflex save onto the crossbar from Jack Cork after Batefimbi Gomis' flick-on reached him at the far post. Cork screwed the rebound into the six-yard box where it struck the unfortunate Trippier and diverted it past the goalkeeper whose despairing final touch was when the ball had crossed the line. Dyche sent on a third striker Sam Vokes for winger Michael Kightly to try and salvage something from the game. And Fabianski frustrated Barnes again with a nice dive to his right to keep out the player's curler. The former Arsenal goalkeeper then produced another outstanding stop to deny Vokes as Swansea climbed above West Ham into eighth place. Barnes' day lasted 87 minutes though he got sympathetic applause when he was replaced by Lukasz Jutkiewicz.

"Convicted rapist Ched Evans will reportedly not be offered a contract with Sheffield United - following claims club bosses are shocked at the  public reaction to the striker's return to football. The 25-year-old returned to training with the club this week after he was released from jail last month, having served half his five-year rape sentence. But after a huge backlash from a series of high-profile supporters, including Jessica Ennis-Hill and presenter Charlie Webster, the Yorkshire club's executives now appear to be distancing themselves from moves to offer the Welsh international a new contract. Scroll down for video . Ched Evans, pictured this week, will not return to Sheffield United after club bosses branded him 'toxic' The family of Natasha Massey, fiancee to Ched Evans,  have helped fund a website protesting his innocence . A source told the Sun that club executives will back the decision tomorrow to block Evans from joining his former team-mates on the pitch. 'The club wanted Ched to play for them and expected to get some grief because of that. 'But they have been blown off course by the strength of feeling of the general public and people and companies connected to the club.' The source added: 'They feel Ched has become toxic now.' Sheffield United was already facing a huge backlash from high-profile supporters, MPs, sponsors and rape charities. TV presenter Charlie Webster, 32, stepped down as a patron of the club on Tuesday. Speaking on BBC Newsnight, the women's rights campaigner said: 'At no point have Sheffield United acknowledged the extremity of his crime. 'Nobody is making a decision (at the club) and I suppose I feel I need to make a decision as a patron of Sheffield United.' Jessica Ennis-Hill, 27, has received threats to rape her on Twitter after she said she wanted her name removed from a stand at Sheffield United if Ched Evans, who was convicted of rape, is re-signed by the club . A stand at the stadium in Bramall Lane could have to be re-named if Ched Evans returns to the club to play . Most recently, Ennis-Hill declared she would want her name removed from a stand at the stadium in Bramall Lane if Evans was given a contract. In a statement, she explained: ‘I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people’s lives and set a good example. ‘If Evans was to be re-signed by the club it would completely contradict these beliefs.’ And last night, South Yorkshire police said they are investigating after threats of rape were made to the Olympic champion. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, condemned the threats, tweeting: ‘Rape threats against @J-Ennis are sick and vile. This is totally out of order.’ TV presenter Charlie Webster, left , has resigned from her role as Sheffield United patron, followed by Lindsay Graham, right, after the club decided to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to train . The attack on Ennis-Hill came after FA chairman Greg Dyke said the row over whether Evans should play football again was ‘not an important issue’. Mr Dyke, 67, appeared on BBC’s Newsnight on Thursday to discuss a report alleging corruption over England’s World Cup bid. But when asked about Evans, Mr Dyke said: 'It’s a dilemma and it’s not clear cut.’ Asked where he stood, Mr Dyke blustered: ‘It’s not an important issue … err … is an important issue but not in terms of what we, we’re here, and what you asked me to come on and talk about.’ Evans was released from jail after serving two and a half years of a five-year sentence for raping a teenager at a hotel in 2011. An appeal against his conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012, but his case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. MailOnline has contacted Sheffield United for comment.","The footballer was due to begin training with former teammates this week .

"A service for K-9s and their handlers has taken place in Palm Harbor, Florida, to honour police dogs who have died since their retirement. Five German Shepherds, named Vader, Jester, Deuce, Thor and Judge were remembered during the service at the Curlew Hills Memorial Gardens Pet Cemetery where the animals are buried. Tributes were also paid to a sixth yellow Labrador, called Sirius, who is not buried at the cemetery, but was the only service dog to die on 9/11. Police K-9s and their handlers have attended a service in Palm Harbor, Florida, to honour former service dogs . The service paid tribute to five German Shepherds, Vader, Jester, Deuce, Thor and Judge who are commemorated with a plaque each, along with Sirius, a yellow Labrador who died during 9/11 . According to the Tampa Bay Times, Keenan Knopke, the cemetery's president, said: 'These are officers, really, that serve the public well. They need to be remembered in the correct fashion.' During the service, each of the dog's former handlers gave a short speech about the exploits of their partners.

Dodge was a Clearwater police dog from 2003-2007, whike Thor, served as a Pinellas County unit member from 1974-1977 and 1981-1983. Dozens of current and former handlers, some of them with their dogs, attended the service, which included a sermon by Rev. Danny McDonald and a performance of Amazing Grace on bagpipes. While in service, the dogs honored helped to locate explosives, narcotics and missing children.","Memorial service held for police dogs who have died since retirement .

"Her wardrobe boasts rack upon rack of designer dresses and her jewellery collection includes £800 diamond earrings and a £2,800 Rolex watch. She surely wouldn’t dream of venturing out without her £150 Gucci handbag, and on chilly days, wrapping up in one of her four £190 cashmere and fox fur capes is a must. The only dilemma Romany Rose Rowland might face is which pair of shoes to select from the neat rows of sparkly £70 designer numbers that line her boudoir. Not that it particularly matters – because Romany Rose is just five months old, and of course, she can’t yet walk. Romany Rose Rowland's wardrobe boasts rack upon rack of designer dresses and her jewellery collection includes £800 diamond earrings and a £2,800 Rolex watch. She is pictured with her 20-year-old mother, Witney, who lives near Plymouth with her parents . Romany is pictured above left wearing a £190 fox fur cape, and, right, wearing her Rolex. ‘I want her to have it all, and to have the money to do whatever she wants to. When Romany is in one of her big dresses she is so happy and smiley because she gets so much attention,' said single mother Witney, who runs a beauty parlour . Her vast array of flouncy dresses, frou-frou bonnets and frilly tutu skirts – not forgetting her £10 crystal and diamante-encrusted dummy – comes courtesy of her 20-year-old mother Witney Rowland and a set of doting grandparents who have spent a fortune blinging up baby. Her mother confesses her ‘ultimate dream is for Romany Rose to be the new Honey Boo Boo’ – a reference to the popular American reality series featuring child beauty pageant contestant Alana ‘Honey Boo Boo’ Thompson. It attracted up to 3million viewers, but also received complaints that it exploited children, with one US critic calling it ‘a horror story posing as a reality television programme’. But for the moment, all of that is of little concern to Romany Rose. As befitting a star in the making, she travels in style thanks to a fleet of nine £1,450 prams, selected on the day to match her outfit. If she ever gets a TV or movie audition it would be almost unthinkable that her fine, downy hair would not have been blow-dried and set with her pink Velcro rollers. Afterwards, she could relax in her £400 pastel-pink bathtub, before dozing off in a 200-year-old crib, recently restored and valued at a hiccup-inducing £2,000. And if that wasn’t enough, for Christmas she’ll be getting a £3,000 handmade princess bed and a £500 ride-on toy Range Rover. Grotesque over-indulgence? Or simply an enterprising young mother trying to make sure her precious daughter has all she needs for a path to stardom? ‘Everything I do is for Romany Rose and to make things easier for her when she grows up,’ says Miss Rowland, a single mother who runs a beauty parlour and lives near Plymouth with her parents Christine, 39, and 52-year-old Maurice, a blacksmith with a successful wrought iron business. ‘I want her to have it all, and to have the money to do whatever she wants to. 'When Romany is in one of her big dresses she is so happy and smiley because she gets so much attention. ‘If the time comes when she doesn’t want to be dressed up, then I will throw away all the big dresses and buy her the outfits she does want to wear. 'I’ll be disappointed, but it will be entirely up to her.’ So far Romany Rose – a perfectly adorable, contented baby – has enjoyed remarkable success in beauty pageants and fashion shows and has had various offers from model agencies. She even has her own Facebook page to keep friends and followers updated on her photoshoots and burgeoning career – but perhaps inevitably, it has drawn occasional cruel comments. ‘When we are out,’ Miss Rowland says, ‘people will say nice things, stuff like “Look at that baby with her Gucci bag!”. ‘But online, people have said some negative stuff. 'That’s just their opinion. They are of course entitled to it, but I think they are probably just jealous.’ As befitting a star in the making, Romany Rose travels in style thanks to a fleet of nine £1,450 prams, selected on the day to match her outfit .","Five-month-old Romany Rose Rowland also has four £190 cashmere and fox fur capes, and £70 designer shoes .

"As a 30-year veteran of BBC news, you would have thought Michael Buerk had seen everything. But perhaps nothing quite like this ... Yesterday the unflappable broadcaster seemed mesmerised by the enthusiastic twerking of Playboy model Kendra Wilkinson as he started his unlikely stint on I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. Wilkinson, 29, was trying to teach Buerk some moves after enjoying a cocktail in the Australian hotel where the celebrities stayed before they headed to the jungle. BBC broadcaster, 68, starts off his unlikely stint on I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in Australia and seems mesmerised as he watches Playboy model Kendra Wilkinson, 29, show him some of her moves . She said: ‘We should do some shots and get this party going. Let’s twerk or something – pick up your pants Michael to loosen them.’ After witnessing the demonstration, Buerk says: ‘Oh right, it’s a bit similar to belly dancing.’ Kendra replies: ‘Yes but with your a***!’ The journalist had raised eyebrows by agreeing to go on the ITV reality show, but said: ‘There’s a tendency to think very highly of one’s self and get terribly stuck up on these things, so all of my family has agreed it’s time I loosen up a bit.’ ‘This is an ideal opportunity to do that, I suppose. It’s not my normal cup of tea, but who knows? I might be converted to it. It’s definitely a new world. But come on, it’s like being an explorer, isn’t it?’ It was in that adventurous spirit he also tried something no 68-year-old white Radio 4 presenter probably should – a hip-hop style handshake. Ghanaian-born rapper Tinchy Stryder (left) shows the presenter (right) how to pull off a hip-hop style greeting . Tinchy Stryder, the 28-year-old Ghanaian-born rapper, showed the broadcaster how to pull off the complex greeting. The hotel offered the last taste of luxury before the celebrities headed into the New South Wales rainforest for the start of the series tonight. Already one of the participants has found it to be an emotional experience. The normally bubbly Gemma Collins from The Only Way Is Essex was so unnerved by the helicopter flight to base camp that she burst into tears, causing her carefully applied make-up to stream down her face. Collins, 33, looked terrified even before she stepped aboard and spent the rest of the flight with her hands over her eyes. At one point, she pleaded with he pilot: ‘Can you stop a minute please. I’m serious, just stop. I need to get out, seriously I’m going to be sick, I can’t do it, no way.’ Her emotions wrecked her plan to make a glamorous arrival in the jungle. Just hours before take-off she told journalists: ‘I’ve already booked a blow-dry before I go into the jungle. I’ve had my nails done and I’m off for a spray tan this evening. 'I’ve had a full set of Russian eyelashes put in before I go in there.’ Also taking part in the series are Coronation Street star Craig Charles, Allo Allo actress Vicki Michelle and TV presenter Melanie Sykes. Former Minister Edwina Currie is also expected to enter the competition at a later date. Mr Buerk, the presenter of Radio 4’s The Moral Maze, admitted he had probably made a mistake by not embarking on a fitness routine before his arrival. He said: ‘I have been in denial. I didn’t prepare at all, which was probably a dreadful mistake.’ He flew down under as the pop stars who were inspired to record the original Band Aid charity single by his news reports from Ethiopia in 1984 reunited in London. They were joined by a new generation of pop stars to record a new version of Do They Know It’s Christmas? to raise money to combat Ebola.","Broadcaster in Australia to start stint on I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here .

"Joan claims her life has been ruined ever since she received a police caution for 'child cruelty' in 2006 . A mother given a criminal record for leaving her six-year-old son home alone for 45 minutes has told how it has ‘destroyed’ her reputation and career. She was given a police caution for ‘child cruelty’ when she left her son at home while she had a driving lesson in 2006. Eight years on she is battling to have it removed from her records, saying it has left her feeling ‘ostracised’ and like a ‘hardened criminal’. As a result of this case and others, the Government is being pressed to issue clear guidelines on what age and for how long children can be left alone. The divorced mother of two, who wants to be known only as Joan, is a support worker for vulnerable adults. She does not want her surname disclosed for fear it will affect her future employment. ‘I am a hard-working and loving mum who made a mistake,’ she said. ‘I would never have left my son alone if he wasn’t 100 per cent safe and secure.’ She left her little boy at home ‘as a last resort’ on a school inset day when she could not find childcare, locking kitchen and bedroom doors and leaving him in front of the television with snacks and a drink. ‘I asked him if he was OK and that Mummy wouldn’t be long,’ she said. ‘No danger could have come to him.’ But while she was away he answered the phone to his sister’s school nurse, who was calling to arrange vaccinations. She asked him where his mother was and other questions, before he burst into tears. The nurse called police and by the time Joan returned, three policemen were at her doorstep, attempting to force the door open. She said: ‘He was confused because he had a lady asking him questions he couldn’t answer. They searched my house for drugs and alcohol. I was treated like a hardened criminal.’ Joan, who is divorced and lives with her children in East Birmingham, was advised by a lawyer to accept a caution to avoid going to court and reassured it would remain on her records for only five years. Eight years on, her records still state she was cautioned for ‘an act of cruelty to a child or young person’, under the Children Act 1993. She is forced to declare this in Disclosure and Barring Service checks, formerly known as CRB checks, for her work. ‘It is hugely humiliating,’ she said. Her son is now 14, head boy of his school and in trials for Premier League football teams. ‘She doesn’t deserve how she’s been treated, she’s a great mum and she’s always been there for me,’ he said last night. Joan said she was forced to leave her son at home as it was a school inset day and she had a driving lesson . Joan has won a place at university to study mental health nursing but was turned down by two institutions due to the caution. ‘My image is tarnished,’ she said. ‘It is something I relive every day of my life. It was the first and last time I left him alone and something I regret.’ The case has sparked fierce debate, with some parents horrified by her treatment while others warn that young children should never be left alone. John Hemming, Lib Dem MP for Birmingham Yardley, who is helping Joan with her case, has tabled a parliamentary question asking for clearer guidelines, adding: ‘While certain things may not be a very good idea, they shouldn’t be criminal.’ West Midlands Police said a caution is disclosable for five years however some offences are disclosable indefinitely.","Joan said she left her son at home while she went on a driving lesson .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has said he has no worries about referee Mark Clattenburg taking charge of their game at Liverpool on Sunday despite the official missing a key penalty decision in last season's corresponding fixture. In contrast to title rival Jose Mourinho who claims there is a 'campaign' against his Chelsea team, a contrite Pellegrini admitted he regrets criticising officials and insisted he should have remembered to praise Mr Clattenburg for his performance when Chelsea and City drew 1-1 at Stamford Bridge last month. With clear reference to Mourinho, with whom he has long held a strained relationship, Pellegrini said: 'I don't want to talk about minutes.' The Chelsea boss listed the minutes of four controversial incidents against Burnley last weekend to make his point against referee Martin Atkinson. Manuel Pellegrini has defended Mark Clattenburg ahead of Sunday's game against Liverpool . The Manchester City boss has previously been critical of the official, but seems to have changed his mind . The presence of Clattenburg in the middle at Anfield is intriguing with City knowing victory would take them within two points of leaders Chelsea. The official failed to award City a late penalty for handball against Martin Skrtel in last season's 3-2 win for Liverpool – a decision that looked to have handed the title advantage to Liverpool at the time. Pellegrini, who was banned by Uefa last year for saying Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson was 'not impartial' for sending off Martin Demichelis during their Champions League defeat against Barcelona, criticised Clattenburg earlier this season for his display in City's 2-2 draw against Arsenal at The Emirates Stadium. 'He had a very bad day against Liverpool and today he had a very bad day. Arsenal scored both goals with fouls,' he complained. Clattenburg was the referee when Manchester City met Liverpool last season at Anfield . Coutinho scored the winning goal in last season's game, but Pellegrini was upset with the refereeing . But having heard Mourinho wage war on officials for the past month, the Chilean was in a far more reflective mood. 'I don't have any worries about Mark Clattenburg because I think he's a good referee,' said Pellegrini. 'I criticised him after the game we played against Arsenal because I thought he didn't do well in that game. After that, he was terrific against Chelsea and I didn't remember in that moment to say that. That was a mistake on my part, to say he refereed very well and made no mistakes. 'It is very easy for us to say the referee has made a mistake, especially after you have seen it on television from three, four, five times from different angles. It's very easy to criticise. Pellegrini praised the way Clattenburg handled his side's game with Jose Mourinho's Chelsea this season . The City boss has used his comments as a chance to make a thinly veiled attack on Mourinho's tactics . 'Last year, in the Champions League, I criticised very hard the referee who sent off Demichelis because it wasn't a penalty, it was outside the box. But I said two weeks later I regretted it. I saw on TV it was just two centimetres outside the box, it was a mistake anyone could make. 'Mistakes can happen but they go against you or in favour of you.' Pellegrini's attitude is in contrast to Mourinho's regular claims that officials are consistently against Chelsea. The pair have not got on since Mourinho followed Pellegrini as Real Madrid manager and belittled his time at the Bernabeu. Even so, The FA might look at Pellegrini's comments as their rules prohibit any comment - good or bad - about referees prior to games. Sir Alex Ferguson was warned about his future conduct after he talked about Howard Webb before a big game against Chelsea in 2011, even though his comments were not derogatory. Both City and Liverpool go into Sunday's game at High Noon on the back of European defeats although City have had an extra 48 hours to recover. Defeat for either side would be hugely damaging – City for their prospects of retaining the championship, and Liverpool for qualifying for the Champions League. Pellegrini says he will be prepared to play James Milner even though the versatile England international is out of contract at the end of the season and attracting interest from Liverpool. Wilfried Bony could play against Liverpool, but has not started since signing for Manchester City . Bony has admitted to struggling since returning to England from the Africa Cup of Nations last month . Pellegrini talks to James Milner, who has been attracting the interest of Sunday's opponents Liverpool . The City boss knows he can't force Milner to sign a new deal at The Etihad but says it won't affect his team selection and that the player couldn't expect to play every week in any big-six club in England. 'I will choose the starting 11 from the players I think are in the best moment, not thinking what will happen with him (Milner) next year,' said Pellegrini. 'James hasn't been distracted. I know James Milner, he's a great professional, a player who always gives 100 per cent in every game. That decision about his future is his decision so I don't have any worry about that. 'Everyone in our club wants Milner to stay. After that, you have to make an arrangement with him, there are two parts to the contract. He must decide what he wants. I think an important squad must always have two important players for each position if you want to win something. Milner has been a key player for Manchester City, but could leave at the end of the season . Yaya Toure, who was suspended for the game against Barcelona in midweek, could return on Sunday . 'You play so many games, have so many injuries. You need two important players in every position, this happens at Man United, at Chelsea, at Arsenal, at Liverpool, in our team. 'Important players must fight for their places. Nobody has a guarantee they will play, not Milner, not anyone. When you go to a big team, you have high competition. But I think James has played a lot this year.' Pellegrini will assess Wilfried Bony before naming his side. The £28million striker has had a stuttering start to his City career since returning from the African Cup of Nations, confessing he has found it hard to adjust from sweltering heat in Equatorial Guinea to near-freezing temperatures in the north-west. He also took a bang after coming on as substitute against Barcelona on Tuesday, a match City lost 2-1. Influential midfielder Yaya Toure was suspended for that game but returns at Anfield.","Manchester City boss hit out at Clattenburg after last season's defeat .

"Those Manchester United fans who have chanted 'four-four-two' at Louis van Gaal during some laboured performances this season should readjust their red-tinted spectacles. Sir Alex Ferguson might have been the greatest manager of the Barclays Premier League era but the notion he sent out every United team to win 7-6 in an orgy of reckless abandon is nonsense. In 2008/09, Ferguson's United drew 0-0 on nine occasions when they had a forward line of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Dimitar Berbatov. There weren't many complaints when they won the Premier League and reached the Champions League final. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has been deployed in a range of different playing roles this season . Although Rooney is traditionally considered a striker, he has recently been dropped deep into central midfield . United chief Louis van Gaal has experimented with tactics and formations since taking over at Old Trafford . Van Gaal has been given little credit for steadying the United ship after they failed to qualify for Europe last season. They travel to West Ham today well set to finish in the top four having conceded one goal in their last six games and nine in their last 18. However, their last two away games, a 2-0 win at QPR and goalless FA Cup draw with Cambridge United, have been met with disgruntlement from supporters who somehow feel the team should never look laboured in any circumstances. Van Gaal doesn't play with two out-and-out wingers like Sir Matt Busby and Ferguson, in his earlier years, did. But very few do anymore in the Premier League. The Dutchman tries to be adventurous in a different way, getting his defenders to push up with the ball so that the team have controlled possession nearer the opposition goal. 'Yes, he wants the responsibility to be on the centre-backs, he doesn't want us to play the easy option,' says defender Chris Smalling. 'It gives us more responsibility to really drive out and find those passes as a lot of teams drop off, and if we can get the ball to the midfielders when they are higher up, rather than dropping in, we are more of a threat.' Wayne Rooney has scored eight goals this season and has made 5 assists for Manchester United . United defender Chris Smalling says that van Gaal places more responsibility on the centre-backs . United are hardly playing an ultra-defensive, Catenaccio style. Their Premier League goal tally of 39 in 23 games is higher than at this stage last season and fourth-best in the division going into today's fixtures. Pivotal to Van Gaal's philosophy of wearing teams down rather than instantly going for the throat is the deployment of England centre-forward Wayne Rooney in midfield. Rooney has bristled when he has played there under previous managers and while Van Gaal admits he needed to persuade his captain, he claims 29-year-old Rooney now enjoys it in the engine room. As a striker, you are reliant on getting service from other players, in midfield you can control a game through your own efforts. 'It's about communication and me giving my arguments why he has to do that,' says Van Gaal. 'And, yes, sometimes convincing him he has to do something for the team. But I don't think he ever complains about where he has to play. And he is also liking to play in midfield because he is more on the ball.' Rooney's stats show that he is adapting to his new life in midfield away from acting as a striker . Rooney's statistics show that he performs better for Manchester United when played in midfield . Louis van Gaal was convinced from the day he took over at Old Trafford that Wayne Rooney could star as a midfielder for Manchester United - and how right he was. Rooney began the season leading the line as United struggled but, as the statistics show, he has been far more influential since dropping into midfield. Rooney averages 31 touches and 24 successful passes more as a midfielder and has also created more chances. Rooney's versatility has been an occasional curse during his career and Van Gaal admits he has to tread sensitively. But he loves the fact his captain can play well anywhere; central midfield, No 10, inside-left, striker or even wide-right, as he appeared on Tuesday night in a 3-0 FA Cup win against Cambridge. 'Not many players can play in as many positions as Rooney because he is multi-functional. But that is also not always a benefit for him. A player normally doesn't like that so I have to take care of that,' admits Van Gaal. 'I like multi-functional players because you can be more varied and more unpredictable for opponents when you change positions. 'When I had that team at Ajax [1995 Champions League winners], I changed Edgar Davids from a winger to midfield, Michael Reiziger was a No 10 and I made him a right-back. Frank Rijkaard came as a No 6 right midfielder and I made him a centre-half. With Rooney that is possible.' Rooney has scored eight goals and has five assists this season. But as he closes in on Sir Bobby Charlton's Manchester United goalscoring record, his manager can't make any promises about how often he will play up front in the future. It was noticeable against Cambridge that Marouane Fellaini was pushed forward while Rooney's role seemed to be delivering crosses. Van Gaal also has Robin van Persie, Falcao and James Wilson to choose from up front. The United manager says: 'Rooney's position depends on the shape of the team and the form of the strikers. Manchester United ran out convincing 3-0 winners against Cambridge in the FA Cup last time out . Louis van Gaal recalls how he converted Edgar Davids from a winger to a central midfielder while at Ajax . Considering Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao and James Wilson, playing Rooney up front is not a given . 'I know I can always use him but I also know I cannot change him so easily from midfielder to striker during a game because I did it once and he was not so good. He can be better moving from striker to midfielder, rather than the other way around. When we play with three defenders and four midfield players, maybe inside-left is better for him. But when we have a different system and need someone right-footed on the wing, he is on the right. 'That is what I am saying to Wayne — your contribution for the team is bigger when you play at right-half. Why? You can cross and can pass better as you are on the right side. Then you can prepare overlaps of Antonio Valencia.' And, of course, while Michael Carrick is injured, Rooney can dictate play from a central area. Whatever the system, Van Gaal is aware the responsibility of being United manager is to entertain, and win. He spoke about the 'United Way' on Friday as the club marked the 57th anniversary of the Munich air crash and said afterwards: 'It doesn't matter, wingers or not wingers, three or four at the back, it is about being effective.' United fans put a curse on the previous manager whenever they sang: 'Come on David Moyes, play like Fergie's boys.' As Van Gaal prepares for a difficult afternoon in the trenches at Upton Park, a little understanding from his own following wouldn't go amiss. Rooney's versatility will be used by van Gaal and the United captain will play where they 'need him most'","Louis van Gaal has experimented with his tactics at Manchester United .

"Britain’s biggest force is already recruiting those who have been on the wrong side of the law in a controversial attempt to increase race diversity . Convicted criminals will be allowed to join the police under plans to relax strict entry rules that critics fear will undermine standards. For the first time, candidates will be considered if they have convictions, cautions or fines for offences likely to include possession of cannabis or shoplifting. The Mail on Sunday has established that Britain’s biggest force is already recruiting those who have been on the wrong side of the law in a controversial attempt to increase race diversity. It can also be revealed that all forces across England and Wales will be encouraged to adopt softer rules on who should be ruled out from becoming a police officer. The College of Policing, which sets standards for the profession, is to publish a code of practice in the New Year on the vetting of would-be police officers. It will set out a relaxation of the current rules – which ban anyone with previous convictions, cautions or fines in all but the most exceptional circumstances – on the grounds that it is keeping potentially valuable people from becoming police officers. Instead, the college will tell police chiefs they can take on applicants with criminal pasts, as long as they are open about what they did. Those guilty of relatively minor offences, particularly those committed several years ago and which resulted in light sentences, are likely to be let in to forces. Applicants who try to hide what they did, or who committed serious crimes involving violence, sex offences or fraud, will continue to be barred from a career in uniform. And it will still be down to chief constables or personnel directors to make the final decision on a candidate. A spokesman for the College of Policing confirmed last night: ‘We are looking at reviewing the national standards around vetting. The current vetting standards are creating barriers to people who might be interested in policing. We need to look at this and apply discretion for minor convictions.’ But critics warned the move risked damaging public trust in the service, and claimed it was unnecessary as there is no shortage of highly qualified people who want to sign up. Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents rank-and-file officers, said: ‘The public need to have the utmost confidence that police officers are of the highest calibre and integrity and I have serious and grave concerns about anything which could undermine that.’ The current tough vetting rules, set out by The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in 2012, do not provide an all-out ban on recruiting people with previous, as each case has to be considered individually. About 1,000 serving officers have committed some offence, but most are minor infringements of motoring law. ACPO rules warn, however: ‘Police forces should not recruit people with convictions, cautions and judicial or other formal disposals, which may call in to question the integrity of the applicant or the service. Scroll down for video . All forces across England and Wales will be encouraged to adopt softer rules on who should be ruled out from becoming a police officer . ‘The public is entitled to expect police forces will recruit people who demonstrate the highest standards of professional conduct, honesty and integrity.’ Ahead of the new nationwide code of practice, Scotland Yard has already relaxed its own rules to get more black and ethnic officers on the force, so that it becomes more representative of London’s diverse population. In a recent report the Met said: ‘Vetting removes 1.6 per cent of all applicants from the recruitment process. However, it removes 4.5 per cent of BME candidates. Earlier this year the Metropolitan Police Service Management Board agreed to accept a higher risk tolerance, particularly where offences occurred some time ago and which were of a minor nature. The force now disregards the existing ACPO guidance, which says anyone with a Penalty Notice for Disorder (PND) should normally be barred from becoming a constable. PNDs – on-the-spot fines – can be issued for offences ranging from possession of cannabis and shoplifting to using abusive words and being drunk and disorderly. Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘Those who join the police should be beyond reproach. Standards must be kept at the highest level.’","Candidates will be considered if they have convictions, cautions or fines .

Scroll down for video... 'Oh ***t' KTVU producer Brad Belstock, pictured, tweeted these two words yesterday after the humiliating broadcast went out .

She then proceeded to read out four fake names from a teleprompter as they appeared on screen over footage of the wreckage.

However, . with the camera's rolling and in the middle of a live broadcast, Ms. Campbell continued to read without so much as flinching: 'Wi Tu Lo, Ho Lee Fuk, Bang Ding Ow.'

On his evening newscast, anchor Frank Somerville apologized further. 'First, we never read the names out loud, phonetically sounding them out,' he said. 'Then, . during our phone call to the NTSB where the person confirmed the . spellings of the names, we never asked that person to give us their . position with the agency. 'We heard this person verify the information without questioning who they were and then rushed the names on our noon newscast.' In . a statement the NTSB admitted a summer intern had 'erroneously' confirmed the names of the flight crew and was 'acting outside the scope . of his authority' in doing so. 'The . National Transportation Safety Board apologizes for inaccurate and . offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of . Asiana flight 214, which crashed at San Francisco International Airport . on July 6,' the NTSB said in a statement. 'Earlier . today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern . acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed . the names of the flight crew on the aircraft,' it added. Days earlier, KTVU news director Lee Rosenthal was crowing about how good his news operation had performed. 'Being . first on air and on every platform in all aspects of our coverage was a . great accomplishment, but being 100% accurate, effectively using our . great sources and social media without putting a single piece of . erroneous information on our air, is what we are most proud of as a . newsroom.' The station issued a statement on Friday afternoon acknowledging it had 'misidentified the pilots involved.' Third victim: A San Francisco hospital says a third victim of a plane crash, a Chinese girl, has died from her injuries. She was among about a dozen injured still in hospital after Asiana flight 214 crashed as it approached the airport too low last week . In an-online apology, KTVU general . manager Tom Raponi wrote: 'We sincerely regret the error and took . immediate action to apologize, both in the newscast where the mistake . occurred, as well as on our website and social media sites. Nothing is . more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and . integrity, and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of . error does not happen again.' However, the apologies from KTVU and the NTSB have done little to abate anger over the issue. Paul Cheung, president of the Asian American Journalists Association, said in a statement: 'Those . names were not only wrong, but so grossly offensive that it’s hard for . us at the Asian American Journalists Association to fathom how those . names made it on the broadcast. 'With . such a vaunted reputation among local news stations, we expected much . more from KTVU. We fail to understand how those obviously phony names . could escape detection before appearing on the broadcast and were spoken . by the news anchor. We urge KTVU to conduct a thorough review to . prevent similar lapses.' 'AAJA . is embarrassed for the anchor of the noon broadcast, who was as much a . victim as KTVU’s viewers and KTVU’s hard-working staff, including the . journalists who produced stellar work covering the crash.' 'But . we’re mostly saddened that a tragedy that took the lives of three . people and injured scores of other passengers could be taken as an . opportunity for an apparent joke.' Another unidentified teen has died of her injuries bring the death toll in the tragic crash up to three. A further 180 people were injured, many serious. Based in Oakland, California, the Fox affiliate represents a city where 16.8% of the population is Asian. KTVU . also broadcasts in two heavily Asian-populated communities: San . Francisco, where Asians make up 33.3% of the total population and San . Jose, where 32% of the population is Asian. KTVU’s . false report comes after a week of speculating whether last week's . disastrous Asiana Airlines crash could be attributed to Korean 'culture' and whether South Korea’s tradition of deference to hierarchy could . have played a role in the crash. Broken news: Anchor Tori Campbell read the names off the teleprompter and didn't bat an eye, adding that the information had been confirmed by the National Transportation Safety Board . Asiana Airlines has identified two of the four flying crew on board as the pilot and copilot Lee Kang-kook and Lee Jung-min. Coverage . of the tragic plane crash at San Francisco International Airport, which . killed three people and injured dozens of others last Saturday has . proven tricky for some news outlets. Earlier . this week, the Chicago Sun-Times apologized for its front page headline . 'FRIGHT 214,' which was criticized for sounding like a stereotype of an . Asian accent.","Station broadcast inaccurate names but apologized for the error a few minutes later .
KTVU says it confirmed the information with the National Transportation Safety Board .

"Camels are mentioned in Biblical stories involving Abraham, Joseph and Jacob as well as other famous characters. But archaeologists have found that the mammals were not domesticated in Israel until centuries after famous figures were said to have ridden them. They claim this shows that text in the Bible was compiled long after the events described in it and challenges the holy book as a historical document. Archaeologists have found that camels were not domesticated in Israel until centuries after famous figures such as Abraham were said to have ridden them. An engraving from The Dore Bible showing Abraham journeying into the Land of Canaan, by Gustave Dore, is pictured . Genesis 37:25 'Then they sat down to eat a meal. And as they raised their eyes and looked, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing aromatic gum and balm and myrrh, on their way to bring them down to Egypt.' Genesis 24:10 'Then he loaded ten of Abraham’s camels with all kinds of expensive gifts from his master, and he traveled to distant Aram-naharaim.' Genesis 24:61 'Then Rebekah arose with her maids, and they mounted the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed.' Source: KnowingJesus.com . Camels were not domesticated in Israel until centuries after the Age of the Patriarchs – when Abraham, Jacob and Issac are said to have lived - between 2,000 and 1,500 BC. Dr Erez Ben-Yosef and Dr Lidar Sapir-Hen of Tel Aviv University's Department of Archaeology and Near Eastern Cultures used radiocarbon dating to pinpoint the moment when domesticated camels arrived in the southern Levant. They found camels came in the 9th century BC, not the 12th as previously thought. The findings, described in the journal Tel Aviv, draw more attention to the disagreements between Biblical texts and verifiable history. ‘The introduction of the camel to our region was a very important economic and social development,’ Dr Ben-Yosef said. ‘By analysing archaeological evidence from the copper production sites of the Aravah Valley, we were able to estimate the date of this event in terms of decades rather than centuries,’ he said. Archaeologists have found that camels came to the south Levant in the 9th century BC, not the 12th as was previously thought. A modern camel outside Jerusalem is pictured . By analysing archaeological evidence from the copper production sites of the Aravah Valley the archaeologists were able to estimate when the first domesticated camels arrived in the region from the Arabian Peninsula . It is believed that camels were originally domesticated in the Arabian Peninsula for use as pack animals sometime towards the end of the second millennium BC. The oldest known domesticated camel bones were discovered in the Aravah Valley, in the southern Levant, which runs along the Israeli-Jordanian border from the Dead Sea to the Red Sea and come from a time when the valley was an ancient centre for copper production. Dr Ben-Yosef dated an Aravah Valley copper smelting camp where the domesticated camel bones were found in 2009 and discovered they dated to between the 11th and 9th century BC. He led another dig in the area in 2013 to determine exactly when domesticated camels appeared in the southern Levant. Together with Dr Sapir-Hen, he used radiocarbon dating and other techniques to analyse the findings of these digs as well as several others done in the valley. In all the digs, they found that camel bones were unearthed almost exclusively in archaeological layers dating from the last third of the 10th century BC or later – centuries after the patriarchs lived and decades after the Kingdom of David, according to the Bible. The few camel bones found in earlier archaeological layers probably belonged to wild camels, which archaeologists think were in the southern Levant from the Neolithic period or even earlier. The archaeologists claim their study shows that text in the Bible was compiled long after the events described in it and challenges the holy book as a historical document . Dr Ben-Yosef and Dr Sapir-Hen think the Aravah Valley and would have been a logical entry point for domesticated camels into the southern Levant as it bordered the Arabian Peninsula. They believe the first domesticated camels ever to leave the area may be buried in the Aravah Valley. The arrival of domesticated camels promoted trade between Israel and exotic locations that were previously unreachable. Camels can travel over much longer distances than the donkeys and mules that preceded them. By the seventh century BC, trade routes like the Incense Road stretched all the way from Africa through Israel to India. Camels opened Israel up to the world beyond the vast deserts to profoundly alter its economic and social history, the researchers said.","Archaeologists from the University of Tel Aviv, Israel, found that camels were not domesticated in Israel until the 9th century BC .

"A pageant queen and self-ascribed 'beauty guru' has sent shock waves through the internet by posting a startling video in which she addresses her rapist father and threatens him with three guns. Brie Lybrand put up a twelve minute piece in which she explains that her abusive father has recently subscribed to her channel and tells him 'now is the time' for her to speak out about his crimes. Calling the post, a 'different kind of video' than normal, the Lousiana native launches into a harrowing attack on a Steven Bressler, the father she says sexually abused her from the age of four to 13. Scroll down for video . Watch out: New Orleans 'beauty guru' Brie Lybrand normally posts videos about her makeup and shopping but her latest is a shocking attack directed at an abusive father she says raped and tortured her for nine years . Ms Lybrand, whose normally upbeat videos are watched by over 2,000 viewers and contain tips on beauty brands and shopping advice,  appears in the video without even a hint of the makeup so immaculately applied in previous posts, looking tired and vulnerable. 'My zombie eyes are in full affect,' she half-quips mustering the effort to laugh at herself through tears before explaining the motive behind her post. 'I just got an email from You Tube . saying the man that raped me for most of my life subscribed to me. The . man that took my virginity, robbed me of innocence, has subscribed to me . on You Tube and is watching my videos.' 'I . never got to testify in court and tell him what it feels like being . tied up and chained and tortured for hours when you're four years old by . your father,' she continues. Trauma: The usually perfectly made-up former pageant queen and actress appears bare faced and teary as she explains that the man who repeatedly raped her recently subscribed to her popular You Tube channel . Unforgiving: Ms Lybrand tells him that 'now is the time' for her to speak out about the unspeakable things he did to her as a child which she claims she never got to tell to a court . According to the statement, her father not only forced himself on her but tried to kill her mother, Ron Lybrand, 'many times'. One account recalls a night on which he beat 'the teeth out of' her for trying to protect her daughter. 'I watched my mother in a pool of her own blood and then he came after me,' she says. 'Even at my age I still have nightmares that he's coming back to kill me.' Though Ms Lybrand tells her viewers that she got away from him at 13, how she managed to do this is unclear as she still lives in the city in which she grew up. A lifelong resident of New Orleans, Ms Lybrand's own website exclaims proudly: 'I was born and raised in the ""Crescent City"" also known as ""The Big Easy,"" New Orleans and am proud to call it home!' Remaining in New Orleans for college, the bit-part actress attended Tulane University in the city where she graduated with a degree in Theatre and History and though now she spends a significant amount of time sharing her secrets on You Tube, according to her latest post she also teaches children. Happier: A self-ascribed 'beauty guru', Ms Lybrand's website hosts her advice videos and tells fans of her latest bit-parts in movies and commercials . 'You wanna see what kind of person I . turned out to be?' She challenges her father before the video cuts to a . new shot and she lists her achievements as cheer-leading captain at high . school and college graduate. Her choice to become an actor is one, she explains, chillingly, that she credits to him. 'I think I became an actor because I had to escape my reality. The reality of the tortures of what you did. I got really good at it. I got really good at pretending I was somewhere else. Steven Bressler, when you were raping me my mind was somewhere else. 'I was in Disney World, or I was on a beach. Or on a swing listening to Broadway musicals. But I was anywhere except you on top of me. And I have turned that into my career.' Switching the subject, Ms Lybrand . then goes on to ask how he managed to get someone to marry him and calls . his new wife by her name. How she knows this information is unclear but she . refers to a lady named Suz and then claims her real name is Glenda. See an extract from the video here. NOTE: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Pretty: Normally her videos attract about 2,000 views but her latest offering has drawn over 200,000 . Perhaps . the most shocking act in the beauty queen's story is at five minutes . when she introduces her father to a substantial arsenal of weapons. Ms Lybrand shows viewers three handguns, one by one and tells her father she is always prepared for him. 'Let me show you my friends,' she says before drawing an automatic pistol from a baby pink carry case. She then shows a smaller version that she carries in her purse. And finally a third, pink gun that proves is loaded by opening the barrel. 'Even though I will be forever . damaged because of you, you haven't gotten the best of me... I met a . wonderful man who understands, who is there when I have to cry and when I . have to be upset on father's day when I didn't have a father. I had a . monster. I had a murderer.' The . man she talks about is Nick Rohde who appears in a couple of wedding . photographs on her Facebook page and yet who she refers to later in the . video as her fiance. Snap! Mr Lybrand's fans love the way she shoots her video from the comfort of her own home making the posts personal and cute . Brie Lybrand acts in the short film that she wrote and acted in called 'Waiting ... on Godot' 'I wish for your death every day,' she begins to conclude. 'You don't deserve to breathe the same air that I breathe. When you die, I will find your grave and I'm going to take a big, heaping dump on it because that's what you deserve.' The actress then suppresses a smile and wipes her face before continuing. 'I hope you see my face every day for the rest of your miserable life,' she says before urging him to unsubscribe from her channel. 'In the end you're going to be punished and I can't wait. Until then, stay out of my way.' Gawker has pointed to opinions that the story may have been made given Ms Lybrand's penchant for acting but others have argued that she has too much of web presence to fabricate something so serious.

"The saying goes that you can't teach an old dog new tricks. But this dog showed that he was trying to learn a few new tricks when he got his head stuck in a cat house in Long Island and had to be rescued by amused police officers. Buddy, the golden retriever was clearly curious when he pushed his head in the cat house on Friday morning to take a look inside. Stuck: Two officers from Suffolk County Police Department dismantle a cat's house in an attempt to free Buddy the dog after his head got stuck . But he didn't bank on getting stuck. Officers Stephen Lukas and Martin Gill, along with Sergeant Kit Gabrielsen, came to the rescue at 11:10 a.m. after a woman reported that her dog was stuck in a cat house. The officers from Suffolk County Police Department in Medford, New York, used crow bars and a hammer to dismantle the green and white  house while the dog's head hung out of it. Buddy was freed, unharmed and released to his owner. Police said the nosy golden retriever is absolutely fine after his ordeal.

"Dr Nikki Goldstein says that our busy lives are one of the main reasons why couples end up having less sex and time together . Around 90 per cent of Australian couples are having less sex than when they first met, according to new research. Sexologist Dr Nikki Goldstein told Daily Mail Australia that busy lives are one of the main reasons couples end up having less sex and time together. Couples need to build up their emotional connection and because Australian men are not taught to talk about their emotions it makes it difficult, she said. 'People need to have fun, you need to be able to laugh with your partner to make your sex life better. 'You don’t need to renovate your house into a dungeon into something like out of Fifty Shades of Grey. 'Couples just need to implement one thing into your behaviour to change things. 'Not everyone is going to do a sex tape but it's something different and fun and that is what sex should be about. The emotional connection will grow with communication' she said. The survey revealed that despite 70 per cent of couples still feeling a deep attraction towards one another, they were still unable to have regular intimacy. Dr Goldstein said: 'It is very normal for intimacy to fall by the wayside when life gets busy. 'Time seems to speed up each year with kids at school, long days at work and all of a sudden it has been days, weeks or months since you last shared some alone time with your partner.' The research conducted by Universal Sony Pictures comes as new movie Sex Tape starring Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal releases on DVD. Dr Goldstein said: 'All of a sudden it has been days, weeks or months since you last shared some alone time with your partner' Dr Goldstein says three in five Australians love talking about sex with a third of survey participants admitting to using 'naughty banter' to compare notes with friends. 'We're naturally competitive and it's our instinct to run, out drink and out do one and another, and that extends to the bedroom also,' Dr Goldstein said. She explained that the movie was a good example of how modern day life was getting in the way of people being intimate with their partners. The research is based on theDVD release of Sex Tape starring Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal . Dr Goldstein says the movie is a good example for couples to try and spice up their sex lives . 'I thought it was a really clever an example of what the modern couple is, both of them have careers, have they kids and sex is on the bottom of the list. 'Doing something like a sex tape was that couple's way of trying to get the spark back. 'We have lost the intimacy and we are in this constant fight to want to spice things up.'

"For many couples languishing in a moribund long-term relationship, the idea of a few tense hours on a claustrophobic road trip might prove the final straw. Yet Jayne Wilkinson, 56, and David Turner, 54, put their 12-year union on the line by popping out for a drive that spanned five years, 136,000 miles and 66 countries. And the couple say the adventure brought them closer together despite brushes with malaria, snakebites, gun-toting officials, and the biggest threat to their trip – David's inability to put the lid back on the toothpaste. Feeling festive: Jayne Wilkinson, 56, and David Turner, 54, celebrated Christmas in Acapulco, Mexico . Jayne said: 'Most people assume we must have been a really close couple to start this journey but that's wrong. I suspect we may have separated had it not been for the trip. 'The pressures of work were becoming harder, we spent little time together and we didn't even have that much in common. But now we know what we have in common and that is travelling. That is our glue.' The Birmingham couple first came up with the idea in 2008 after becoming bored with their 9-to-5 lives. David, then a legal rep, and Jayne, a former call centre worker, spent a year planning the trip, buying a Land Rover Defender, which they christened Lizzybus in honour of The Queen. They left Dover on August 16, 2009, with a tent, a small fridge and a £50-a-day budget – and have only just returned. Seeing the sights: Visiting one of the many temples at Angkor Wat complex in Siem Reap, Cambodia . Setting up camp: The couple passed through the Blue Mountains in Australia during their five-year trip . After driving down through Europe, the couple travelled around the edge of Africa, where they encountered one pistol-toting border guard who demanded £125. They haggled and he settled for £1.30 and a can of beer. Jayne said: 'I fell ill in the Democratic Republic of Congo. David had a book called When There Is No Doctor and he realised that I had malaria. We had been taking anti-malaria pills but for three days I was delirious. Eventually I recovered.' But the biggest threat to their trip came from a more domestic source. Jayne said: 'David kept leaving the toothpaste lid off and it was making a mess. When you are living out of the back of car everything becomes magnified and it can drive you insane. We had a huge barney which ended up with us vowing to end it all and ship Lizzybus home as we couldn't bear to sit next to each other for another minute. We wanted to talk to someone about the row but only had each other.' Ends of the earth: Crossing through the Arctic Circle in Alaska in their Land Rover Defender, which they christened Lizzybus . Relations were eventually fixed and they moved on, through Syria, Turkey, Iran, India, South-East Asia and on to Australia where Jayne had another misfortune: 'In the bush and felt a knock on my foot – and saw a snake. An hour later my foot started to swell and I saw fang marks. I panicked, but as I felt fine I concluded it must have been non-venomous. 'When I told locals they said it was a deadly Eastern Brown snake, and it must have just attacked something else, so when it bit me there was no venom left – a lucky escape.' The couple crossed to South America then made their way up to America, Alaska and Canada before their return. Jayne said: 'We've had the most incredible adventure, terrifying at times, but amazing. We are just ordinary people who gave up jobs, houses and nice lives to live 2ft away from each other 24 hours a day. 'I think most would see that as a nightmare rather than a dream and it did feel like that to start with but we had told everyone we were going around the world, so it would have been embarrassing to come home.' And the trip has not satisfied their wanderlust – in the new year they plan to hit the road again, heading for Japan and Russia. They travelled 136,000 miles through 66 countries on a £50-per-day budget and have only recently returned .

"Popular international air routes connecting Europe, North America and Asia are at risk after airplanes were warned to avoid airspace near an erupting Alaska volcano as it spews ash 30,000 feet above sea level. Winds have blowing ash from Pavlof Volcano to the west and southwest, warned the National Weather Service on Saturday. Pavlof began erupting on Wednesday, pushing lava out from a vent near its summit and by Friday the ash cloud had reached 16,000 feet.

Rising: The eruption intensified at 6 a.m. on Saturday, sending the ash cloud higher . The eruption intensified on Saturday morning, sending the ash cloud higher, said Dave Schneider, a geophysicist at Alaska Volcano Observatory. It's not clear how long this eruption will last, Schneider said. Pavlof's eruptions may last for weeks or months with varying levels of intensity, he said. Pavlof is Alaska's most active volcano and is located about 625 miles southwest of Anchorage. It's had more than 40 recorded eruptions, including earlier this year and last year. It also lies along popular international air routes connecting Europe, North America and Asia. On the map: The volcano is located in an uninhabited region nearly 600 miles (966 km) southwest of Anchorage .

Observers there reported seeing dark snow on the surface of the volcano on Wednesday, indicating an eruption had started. There have been some small avalanches of hot rock down the north flank of the volcano. These may produce local mud flows to the north, but scientists say they would likely be minor.

"Germany last night declared that . Britain would be forced to scrap the pound and join the euro – as David . Cameron returned home empty-handed from crisis talks in Berlin. In a highly-provocative intervention, . German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble suggested the UK’s struggling . economy meant the pound was doomed, and urged the Prime Minister to . back Europe’s ailing single currency. Mr Schauble said the euro would . emerge stronger from the current crisis – leaving Britain on the . sidelines unless it signed up. He said Britain would be forced to join . ‘faster than some people on the British island think’ – despite a pledge . by Mr Cameron never to do so. Loggerheads: Despite this show of apparent friendliness, David Cameron and Angela Merkel made no progress yesterday . Clash: The leaders acknowledged their disagreement over a financial transactions tax . Bond spreads as they stood overnight: The yield for troubled governments has become worryingly high . Tory MP Philip Davies suggested Mr Schauble was ‘living in cloud cuckoo land’ and should concentrate on resolving the crisis. He added: ‘Rather than telling us . what to do he should be listening to what people in Germany want – I’m . pretty sure they would rather have the Deutschmark back than bail out . Greece and Italy.’ But Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the . powerful Euro Group of eurozone finance ministers, said Britain was in . no position to comment on the crisis as its deficit was twice the . European average. The Conservatives have long promised a referendum on repatriating powers from the EU, but have not yet delivered one. Angela Merkel's comments today make a referendum less likely, as her 'limited treaty change' will not have to be approved by countries outside the euro, including the UK. The Coalition's 'referendum lock' commits the Government to holding a public vote the next time Britain is supposed to sign up to a new treaty which would hand more power to Brussels. But if the eurozone countries try to solve the debt crisis by closer economic integration, the UK will have no say - even though this could have a massive impact on Britain. Although no referendum will be held, there is nothing to stop the Government from trying to repatriate powers by itself, but without a popular mandate it will be taken less seriously by other EU countries. He said he was ‘not in favour of being dictated to by countries that are doing worse than us’. Mr Schauble’s comments came as Mr . Cameron arrived to a hostile reception in Berlin for talks on the . eurozone crisis with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Senior members of . Mrs Merkel’s ruling coalition voiced their irritation at London’s . ‘lecturing’ over the crisis. Leading German magazine  Der Spiegel ran a prominent feature describing Britain as the ‘dis- eased empire’. And Rainer Brüderle, head of Mrs Merkel’s coalition partners, said: ‘Britain can’t be freeloaders in the eurozone.’ The deputy leader of Mrs Merkel’s . party, Michael Meister, criticised Britain for lecturing the eurozone on . what steps it should take while not actively contributing towards a . solution. He also warned Mr Cameron against . catering to nationalist sentiment on the euro, saying turmoil in the . single currency area could have a devastating impact on countries . outside the eurozone and on London’s financial industry. Mrs Merkel flatly rejected Mr . Cameron’s key demand to allow the European Central Bank to pump in . hundreds of billions of euros to prop up the euro and prevent a new . recession. But in a sign of growing nervousness . about the crisis, the ECB yesterday intervened to buy up Spanish and . Italian government bonds to prevent market speculation driving interest . rates to unsustainable levels. The German Chancellor also made clear . she would press ahead with EU treaty reforms, even if they are opposed . by Britain – although she said she was prepared to show ‘tolerance and . forbearance’. Berlin has drawn up secret plans designed to bypass the threat of a British referendum on treaty reforms. Greeting: Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel met in Berlin yesterday for crisis talks on the future of the EU . Meeting: Earlier, Mr Cameron held talks with EU president Herman Van Rompuy, right, in Brussels . Talks: Mr Cameron also met with Jose Manuel Barroso, right, president of the European Commission . A leaked German memo stated: ‘Limiting . the effect of the treaty changes to the eurozone states would make . ratification easier, which would nevertheless be required by all EU . member states (thereby less referenda could be necessary, which could . also affect the UK).’ The bond yields of troubled eurozone governments have remained stubbornly high today. Both Italy and Spain are hovering around the seven per cent barrier at which repayment costs are considered to be unsustainable. These were the 10-year bond yields of European countries at 2pm today. Italy - 6.77% . Spain - 6.48% . France - 3.56% . Greece - 28.88% . Portugal - 11.42% . Ireland - 8.38% . UK - 2.22% . Germany - 1.90% . The memo will add to fears that . Germany wants to use the eurozone crisis to create a European ‘super . state’ with its own tax and spend policies. Last night a Downing Street source . insisted that all 27 member states had to agree to treaty changes even . if they only affected the 17 eurozone members. He said there would be no . need for a referendum as long as powers were not taken from the UK and . handed to Brussels. Mrs Merkel is determined to establish . a new European Monetary Fund with powers to intervene directly in the . economies of member states. Former prime minister Sir John Major . last night spoke out about the ‘undemocratic’ drive towards greater . fiscal union in the eurozone. He warned of the danger posed by EU . plans to impose a new tax on financial transactions, which he described . as a ‘heat-seeking missile’ targeted at the City of London. Mr Cameron yesterday rejected German . calls for an EU-wide tax. But he was silent on previous demands for the . repatriation of powers to Britain. At a joint press conference with Mrs Merkel the pair admitted they had made ‘no progress’ on key fault lines. Protest: Thousands took to the streets of Barcelona ahead of Spain's general election this weekend . Tory MP Mark Reckless last night said . there would be an unanswerable case for a referendum in this country if . the eurozone decided to press ahead with treaty changes unilaterally. He said: ‘I have no objection to them pressing ahead with creating a . Europe of 17 but we would have to reconsider our own relationship with . that. ‘It would be them leaving us rather than us leaving them – and that would be a very good basis for a referendum.’ Former Tory leadership contender . David Davis yesterday called on Mr Cameron to exploit the crisis to . demand the repatriation of key powers in areas such as employment . rights. Clash: Italy has seen riots after installing an EU-approved technocratic government this week . Demonstration: Marchers in Milan yesterday targeted banks to express their anger at the financial crisis . But Downing Street last night played . down expectations of a major repatriation of powers. Ministers are . instead focusing on securing an opt-out from the financial transactions . tax. Despite the tensions Mr Cameron and . Mrs Merkel attempted to put on a show of unity for the cameras . yesterday. Mr Cameron said: ‘It’s a good relationship. We have strong . agreement on key issues about action the European economy needs to . take.’ But he added: ‘It is obvious that we . don’t agree on every aspect of European policy, but I am clear that we . can address and accommodate and deal with those differences.’ Close: Mrs Merkel and France's Nicolas Sarkozy want to exclude Britain from talks on the eurozone's future . City of London: Mr Cameron is concerned that a financial transactions tax will hit the UK . By ALLAN HALL . Germany’s press has made much of the British prime minister’s differences with Angela Merkel. The media has hardly been the best of friends with Mrs Merkel of late, but it is firmly on her side when it comes to dealing with the ‘old enemy’. Bild carried the headlines ‘Briten . zittern vor Deutschlands Euro-Plänen’ – ‘Britons tremble before . Germany’s euro plans’ – and ‘Europa spricht deutsch, Herr Cameron! Was . wollen die Engländer eigentlich noch in der EU?’ – ‘Europe speaks . German, Mr Cameron! What do the English actually want in the European . Union?’ Financial Times Deutschland wrote: ‘He wants Britain to have a say in the financial crisis, but he doesn’t want his country to have to pay for it. ‘He wants to prevent a core Europe (of Germany and France) from forming,  but at the same time he is unwilling  to contribute to deeper European  integration. Great Britain is lacking a  constructive approach. ‘That’s why the government in London shouldn’t be surprised that it is hearing an increasing number of European countries sigh words like: Things would be a lot easier if we didn’t have the Brits.’ Conservative Die Welt added: ‘Britain is fighting for its future in Europe more vigorously than it has in a long time. The Continent, from which Britain always tried to keep its distance, is unmistakably heading toward a future of more integration, right in front of Albion’s front door. ‘Cameron is constantly talking of “repatriating” powers back to the United Kingdom from Brussels. ‘Does he have nothing else to say about the future of Europe than the constant mantra of a Little Englander? ‘Does he not know about the new treaty negotiations that would be necessary in such a case – at a time when Europe has bigger things to worry about than the concerns of British euroskeptics?’ And the influential business journal Handelsblatt criticised Mr Cameron – but also warned that Germany needs Britain in the EU. ‘Why should the Chancellor worry just now about the British who have so little to offer?’ it asked. ‘If Cameron strews sand into the German efforts toward EU reform, the 17 eurozone countries will do it themselves. ‘But Germany remembers more  than Frenchmen the complicated outsider role of the British – and their meaning in European history. ‘Would it be intelligent to marginalise it, to do without its weight with regard to foreign policy? How would it stand without its defence capabilities? Would there be a domestic market without it today?’","Finance minister's astonishing claim comes despite deepening crisis that threatens the existence of the single currency .

"Israel's prime minister dismissed a recent White House rebuke of Israeli settlement construction, saying in comments broadcast on Sunday that the criticism goes 'against American values.' The tough words by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to deepen a rift with the White House over Israeli construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war and claimed by the Palestinians as parts of a future independent state. Israel came under fire last week after a Jerusalem city official signed the final go-ahead for construction of a new housing development in east Jerusalem. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted the White House, saying the Obama Administration's criticism of Israeli settlements in Israelis 'un-American' A day earlier, an ultranationalist Jewish group said dozens of settlers would move into six apartment buildings purchased in the heart of a predominantly Arab neighborhood of east Jerusalem. Israel says east Jerusalem is part of its capital and considers Jewish housing developments there to be neighborhoods of the city. But the international community, including the United States, does not recognize Israel's annexation of the area and considers construction there to be illegitimate settlement activity. In a striking public rebuke last week, the Obama administration warned Israel that the new project would distance Israel from 'even its closest allies' and raise questions about its commitment to seeking peace with Palestinians. In an interview broadcast Sunday on CBS's 'Face the Nation,' Netanyahu said he does not accept restrictions on where Jews could live, and said that Jerusalem's Arabs and Jews should be able to buy homes wherever they want. He said he was 'baffled' by the American condemnation. 'It's against the American values. And it doesn't bode well for peace,' he said. 'The idea that we'd have this ethnic purification as a condition for peace, I think it's anti-peace.' The interview was recorded Thursday. The White House declined comment.

"Outspoken: Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson will use a speech to attack a 'corrosive sense of entitlement' among voters . Almost nine in ten Scots receive more from the state than they pay in tax because of a ‘corrosive sense of entitlement’ north of the border, a top Tory said yesterday. Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said it was ‘frightening’ only 283,080 households – 12 per cent of the total – pay more in taxes than they get back in public services. She told the party’s annual conference in Birmingham that Scots are now so reliant on ‘the gangmaster state’ that the public sector accounts for more than half of the nation’s wealth. Miss Davidson said the ‘rotten system’ of state patronage had been fuelled by Labour and the Nationalists. The Scottish National Party, led by Alex Salmond, described her comments as her ‘Mitt Romney moment’. They said she had committed the same gaffe as the Republican presidential candidate, who was taped earlier this year appearing to write off the 47 per cent of Americans who pay no income tax. Miss Davidson said a Tory revival in Scotland was being held back because of the public sector ‘stranglehold’, which means any party that seeks to reduce the size of the state cannot make progress. ‘The rotten system of patronage which denies so many people real choices in their lives has created a corrosive sense of entitlement which suits its political gangmasters,’ she said. ‘It is staggering that public sector expenditure makes up a full 50 per cent of Scotland’s gross domestic product and only 12 per cent of households are net contributors, where the taxes they pay outweigh the benefits they receive through public spending. Policy: Davidson's views came as the Tory leadership announced more cuts to benefits . ‘Only 12 per cent are responsible for generating Scotland’s wealth. There are people with household incomes of £50,000 who are paying tens of thousands of pounds in taxation and even that doesn’t cover the amount of money that government spends in their name.’ Anger: Leading SNP politician Kenny Gibson called it Davidson's 'Mitt Romney' moment and says she will have 'insulted' the whole country . She said it was ‘frightening’ that the average Scottish household consumed £14,151 more in public services every year than it pays in tax, according to the Office for National Statistics. Those in the top 10 per cent pay £17,205 more in tax than they receive in public services. Miss Davidson added: ‘If the gangmaster state is the only provider people can see for their housing, education and employment, it’s no surprise those who seek to break the stranglehold find barriers in their way.’ Separate figures yesterday from the Centre for Policy Studies showed that – in Britain as a whole – 53.4 per cent of homes receive more in state benefits and services than they pay in taxes. In 2001 – before Labour’s spending increase – the figure was less than 44 per cent. State benefits and services include unemployment and child benefits and health and education. Describing Miss Davidson’s speech as her ‘Mitt Romney moment’, Kenny Gibson, an SNP member of the Scottish Parliament, said: ‘At least Mitt Romney only insulted around half of Americans.’","Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson says voters have 'corrosive sense of entitlement'

"For his latest public relations stunt North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un has toured an army rations factory - during which he was pictured happily relaxing while barking orders at his subordinates. Pictures from the tour show Jong-Un inspecting products at the factory as he is followed by an eager entourage of confidantes, advisers and yes-men. During the visit, the young despot inspected the factory's production control room, dissemination room and combined processing workshop to learn about how it is attempting to modernise. Kim Jong-Un enjoys a quick sit down while continuing to give orders to his group of subordinates . The despot looks on with interest at a production line where army rations are created for  soldiers . Dozens of bottles of fizzy drink and crisps are placed on a table for Jong-Un's inspection . Unsurprisingly, the lab coat-clad leader is show in various  poses, taking centre stage as he inspects how the products are made. Surrounding him are dozens of men, most of whom are carrying notepads and pens in order to write down his orders. Photos of the visit have been released from the secretive authoritarian state as it is revealed he is planning to send a personal envoy to Russia, state media said yesterday. It is the latest  in a series of diplomatic moves by the isolated country as it fends off accusations of crimes against humanity. North Korean diplomats have been on a vigorous campaign in recent months to counter a UN resolution urging the country's referral to the International Criminal Court, a move which it has dismissed as part of a U.S.-led plot to destroy its political system. The short one-paragraph dispatch said Choe Ryong Hae, a high-ranking member of the ruling Workers' Party widely seen as a close confidant of Kim, would visit Russia 'soon', without elaborating further. A statement on the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website said Choe would visit Moscow on Monday, followed by a visit to the far eastern cities of Khabarovsk and Vladivostok before ending his trip on November 24. A UN inquiry concluded in a February 17 report that North Korean security chiefs and possibly even Kim himself should face international justice for ordering systematic torture, starvation and killings. Outside the factory he gives a speech to a group of subordinates carrying notepads and pens . Jong-Un looks at a machine producing canned goods with curiosity . The tour included visiting the production lines, processing rooms as well as the packaged finished products (pictured) Jong-Un poses for a photograph outside a billboard showing the factory building plans . A group of people posing together outside the factory applaud the leader at the end of the tour . North Korea is already under UN sanctions for repeated nuclear tests and missile launches. Russia, along with the two Koreas, China, the United States and Japan, were participants in years of so-called six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programme which came to nothing. There has been increased diplomatic activity between Russia and North Korea in recent months. Russia shares a short, remote land border with North Korea and has in recent years completed the refurbishment of a railway line and seaport in the north east of North Korea. The two sides plan to discuss enhanced trade and economic cooperation, as well as 'international issues of common interest,' the Russian statement said. Choe met Chinese President Xi Jinping last year as an official envoy of Kim Jong-Un, and made a surprise trip to South Korea in October as part of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games.","North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un takes tour of army rations factory .

"David Cameron will go to Edinburgh today to start the countdown to a referendum on Scottish independence. But he faces criticism back in London that he has given too much ground to the Nationalists by agreeing to most of their demands on how the historic vote should be handled. Lord Forsyth, a former Scottish Secretary, compared Mr Cameron to Pontius Pilate for handing over key decisions on the ballot to SNP first minister Alex Salmond, rather like the Biblical story of the Roman prefect of Judea acceding to the wish of Jewish leaders that Jesus should be put to death. Scroll down for video . Comparion: Lord Forsyth, a former Scottish Secretary, compared David Cameron (left) to Pontius Pilate (right, with Jesus Christ) for handing over key decisions on the ballot to Alex Salmond, rather like the Biblical story . Although the Prime Minister has forced Mr Salmond to drop a second question on increased devolution short of independence, he has agreed to let Mr Salmond suggest the wording of the question, to delay the vote until 2014 and to enable 16 and 17-year-olds to vote. The pair will meet today to sign an agreement on the holding of a referendum. The deal, reached following months of negotiations about the ballot, will grant the Scottish Parliament the power to stage the historic vote. The Prime Minister will say: 'Scotland's two governments have come together to deliver a referendum which will be legal, fair and decisive. This marks the beginning of an important chapter in Scotland's story and allows the real debate to begin. 'It paves the way so that the biggest question of all can be settled: a separate Scotland or a United Kingdom? I will be making a very positive argument for our United Kingdom. 'It is now up to the people of Scotland . to make that historic decision. The very future of Scotland depends on . their verdict. It is that important. This agreement delivers the . people's referendum.' Shaking hands: Prime Minister David Cameron (right) and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond seen in July . But Lord Forsyth said Mr Cameron had given too much away as a result of appalling negotiating skills. He told the Sunday Times: 'Salmond has been able to get what he wants. If that's called a negotiation, that's stretching the language. It sounds like a walkover to me.' 'What is going on here is the prime minister is Pontius Pilate. He is just saying, over to you, Alex. Once that order is passed it's a matter for Alex Salmond so he is going to dictate the terms' Lord Forsyth, former Scottish Secretary . Lord Forsyth said the expected wording of the question - Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country? - was loaded and could swing the vote towards the SNP. 'What is going on here is the prime minister is Pontius Pilate. He is just saying, over to you, Alex. Once that order is passed it's a matter for Alex Salmond so he is going to dictate the terms.' Former chancellor Alistair Darling, who is leading the cross-party Better Together campaign, also criticised aspects of the deal. 'I would have preferred to have had this . referendum in the autumn of 2013 because frankly a two-year election . campaign is going to try the patience of the public, never mind the . politicians and those who write about it,' he said. Unhappy: Lord Forsyth said Mr Cameron had given too much away as a result of appalling negotiating skills . 'In relation to 16 and 17-year-olds I personally don't think you should change the franchise for one particular referendum or election.' 'I would have preferred to have had this referendum in the autumn of 2013 because frankly a two-year election campaign is going to try the patience of the public, never mind the politicians and those who write about it' Alistair Darling, former chancellor . Mr Salmond's deputy Nicola Sturgeon claimed victory, saying: 'If you consider issues over the timing, the question, the franchise, all issues which at the start of the year David Cameron was making noises about; all of these things will now be determined by the Scottish Parliament. I think that is a very good outcome.' Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said: 'I think it's a good agreement. I believe it will now allow us to put up in lights the big issues about the big debate on what is best for Scotland. 'I believe that when we look at the economy, at defence, at our place in the world, on all these big issues people across Scotland will continue to support Scotland being in the United Kingdom.' The most recent poll on independence suggests support for leaving the UK has dropped. A survey of 995 adults, published last week, showed support for the Union at 53 per cent compared with support for independence at 28 per cent.

"A primary school has come under fire after banning its pupils from playing cops and robbers or any playground game which involves 'imaginary weapons'. School chiefs at Worcesters Primary School in Enfield, north London, outlawed the games over a fear that they will upset other children. But parents at the 470-pupil school have reacted with outrage, saying that playing cops and robbers or cowboys and Indians was 'part of growing up'. (Stock picture) School children in Enfield, north London, have been told they can't play cops and robbers .

We all grew up playing cops and robbers and my son loves playing pretend army games - all kids do. 'This just seems like a huge overreaction.' Mr Ayers also spoke out after his son had a fun-size pack of Maltesers confiscated by teachers after it was spotted in his lunch box. My Ayers said: 'I put the Maltesers in as a weekly treat, but the school confiscated them for some reason. 'The school should be concentrating on other things rather than banning children playing games and taking their chocolate away.'

Headteacher Karen Jaeggi defended the policy this week, saying: 'We actively discourage children from playing violent games or games involving imaginary weapons in the playground by explaining to them what it represents. 'Some children can be easily frightened by violent play which is often influenced by computer games and we feel that such games can have a harmful effect on young minds.' Speaking about the ban on chocolate snacks, the headteacher added: 'At Worcesters we promote healthy eating habits since we recognise the problems of childhood obesity in the borough and want to do our best for the children attending this school.'","School chiefs at Worcesters Primary in Enfield outlawed the games .

"New SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has warned her party could hold the 'balance of power' after the next general election. In those circumstances, Ms Sturgeon said the SNP would 'never ever' do a deal that would put the Conservatives into power if they failed to win an overall majority in the UK parliament. The SNP leader said her party could enter into a potential coalition with Labour if they agreed to deliver 'real powers' for the Scottish Parliament. The party would also have to bring an end to austerity cuts and scrap the Trident nuclear missile system in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said her party would 'never ever' do a deal that would put the Conservatives into power, but would consider an alliance with Labour if they agreed on 'real powers' for the Scottish Parliament . Ms Sturgeon, who becomes Scotland's first female first minister in four days' time, was delivering her first conference speech  today since succeeding Alex Salmond as SNP leader. She used the address to set out her key commitments for the 2016 Holyrood elections, but made her comments on the rival parties with the Westminster general election less than six months away. Ms Sturgeon, speaking in the conference in Perth, said: 'Scotland could well hold the balance of power in a Westminster parliament with no overall majority. 'If that happens, I promise our country this: you won't need to have voted Labour to keep the Tories out, because that's what we'll do. 'My pledge to Scotland today is simple - the SNP will never, ever, put the Tories into government. ' In her speech, she also appealed to supporters of other parties to back the SNP in May's general election, in a bid to force Westminster leaders to deliver on the vow they made of substantial new powers for Holyrood in the run-up to the referendum. She said the referendum campaign had 'revitalised this country' and added: 'We will not let Westminster drag us back to business as usual.' Ms Sturgeon added: 'The only language Westminster really understands is that of power. Ms Sturgeon (right) next to her predecessor Alex Salmond (left), said in her first party conference speech as SNP leader that 'you won't need to have voted Labour to keep the Tories out, because that's what we'll do' 'So let them hear this message from all around our country. Power over Scotland no longer rests in the corridors of Westminster. 'In Scotland, today, power rests with the Scottish people - and that is where it will stay.' The new SNP leader continued: 'The first test of that new democratic order is the general election next May. 'Be under no illusion - if we vote for Westminster parties, they will go back to business as usual. 'The promise of more powers will evaporate. The vow will be broken. 'It was the power of our votes that forced them to make that vow. And it is only the power of our votes that will force them to keep it.' Meanwhile, Ms Sturgeon put out ambitious plans for a massive extension of free childcare at the heart of her campaign to win the next Scottish elections.

"A dangerous legal high called speckled cherry is set to be banned after being linked to 37 deaths in the UK and more in Europe. Home Office ministers and drugs experts want to outlaw the synthetic stimulant, also called speckled cross or green rolex, which a coroner has said is like having a serial killer on the loose. Officially known as 4.4-DMAR, it and other legal highs are widely sold in takeaways, petrol stations, newsagents and even pet shops. There are calls to ban a legal high known as speckled cherry, which has been linked to 37 deaths in the UK . Home Secretary Theresa May is being urged to prohibit the stimulant, which is often sold as a 'safe' alternative to Class A party drug Ecstasy. Speckled cherries are often in white pill-form with a cherry or cross logo, but can be bought as a white powder. They cost as little as £3 per tablet. So far, all the deaths have been in Northern Ireland except a 19-year-old woman in Glasgow, Scotland. But experts fear that if ministers don’t act urgently, the substance will soon be costing lives in England. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), which advises the Government on classifying narcotics, also recommended banning a second legal high called MT-45. It is widely sold in takeaways, petrol stations, newsagents and even in pet shops . Although it has not been found yet in the UK the drug, which imitates the drowsy effects of opium, has been blamed for 28 deaths in Sweden in just nine months. The panel said both substances should be categorised as Class A drugs, which carries a penalty of up to seven years in prison for possession or life behind bars for supply. Professor Les Iversen, chairman of the ACMD, said the drugs were lethal and posed ‘serious dangers’. Legal highs are designed to imitate the effects of Class A drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy. But they are not outlawed because they do not have the same chemical compositions as the substances they mimic. Many new drugs are created in back-street laboratories in the Far East and are marketed as plant food or bath salts and marked ‘not for human consumption’ to try to skirt the law. Police cannot stop their sale in shops or at festivals because they are not prohibited. Last month the Home Office said it was considering a blanket ban on the sale of 'legal highs' being sold on the high street. The drugs are no longer the preserve of specialist 'head shops', and are now widely for sale in takeaways, petrol stations, newsagents and even pet shops. Recently released figures show there were 60 deaths related to legal highs last year - up from 52 in 2012 and 29 in 2011.","Home Office want to outlaw the stimulant officially known as 4.4-DMAR .

"It is barely half a century since parts of the Thames were declared ‘biologically dead’ because the river was so dirty. But with the water now cleaner than at any time in living memory, entrepreneurs want to build a £10 million open-air swimming pool in the middle of the Thames in Central London. Purification specialists from Germany – which has the highest water cleanliness standards in Europe – have designed a system which the scheme’s backers say will ensure that bathing is safe for visitors of all ages. Scroll down for video . The lido will have changing rooms, a 130ft ramp leading from the shore to the water, a plunge pool and a children’s paddling area, while a 4ft-high glass barrier will protect swimmers from waves . The Thames Baths at Temple Stairs on the Embankment will be surrounded by reed beds to filter water from the river before it is pumped into the 82ft by 32ft main lap pool, with a secondary filtration device underneath the poolside decking. Health concerns have been raised about the project because of sewage overflows during heavy rain and the experience of comedian David Walliams, who suffered a bout of ‘Thames tummy’ during a 140-mile charity swim in 2011. But experts from German firm Polyplan, which has built natural swimming pools all over Europe, have come up with a solution. Tim Evans, director of British firm Gartenart, which is working on the project, said the water – unheated and chlorine-free – will be ‘as clean as anything you would find in a mountain lake’. The Thames Baths at Temple Stairs on the Embankment will be surrounded by reed beds to filter water from the river before it is pumped into the 82ft by 32ft main lap pool . The lido will have changing rooms, a 130ft ramp leading from the shore to the water, a plunge pool and a children’s paddling area, while a 4ft-high glass balustrade will protect swimmers from waves caused by river traffic. Chris Romer-Lee, of Studio Octopi – the London architects behind the scheme – said he hoped an initial £300,000 to cover consultancy costs and other fees would be raised by crowd-funding, where members of the public can contribute to community schemes. Details can be found at thamesbaths.com. If planning permission is granted, the lido could open late next year.

"Balenciaga has filed a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court in Manhattan accusing Steve Madden of making a ‘studied copy’ of its famous Motorcyle handbag. According to the suit, Balenciaga is seeking an injunction that would forbid Steve Madden from selling the offending item, as well as monetary damages. Court papers read: ‘The Defendant’s wholesale copying of Balenciaga’s designs is likely to deceive consumers into believing that the infringing [handbag] is associated with or authorized by Balenciaga when it is, in fact, not.’ Cracking down: Balenciaga has accused Steve Madden of copying its Motorcycle bag (pictured) and is seeking legal injunction as well as monetary damages . Bag in question? While its not clear which bag Balenciaga is referring to in its suit, a likely guess would be Steve Madden's $88 'Btalia' bag which is currently for sale at retailers including Macy's and Nordstrom .

The . bag - which in its early days was carried by stars as diverse as . Mary-Kate Olsen and Paris Hilton - became so popular that in 2007, . Balenciaga filed a U.S. trade dress to protect the design from . additional counterfeits (by this time, there had been many). It . outlines the Motorcycle bag’s design hallmarks that, if copied, could . potentially cause consumer confusion. According to The Fashion Law these key design features include: ‘The flat pouch . with a zippered rectangular closure, a zipper pull consisting of a strip . centrally-knotted and hanging in two equal lengths, and a . semi-elliptical patch outfitted with two raised studs in each corner; . and two identical patches in an elongated pentagonal shape, featuring an . elongated hexagonal patch outfitted with a buckle and two raised . studs.’ Famous fans: In its 14-year history the Motorcycle bag has enjoyed a diverse array of celebrity fans including Ashley Olsen (left, in 2007) and Kim Kardashian (right, in 2013) These protections . also apply to the Motorcycle bag’s collection counterparts like the .

"A major incident was reportedly declared at a hospital in Essex over concerns raised by the health regulator following a surprise inspection. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) apparently inspected Colchester Hospital's accident and emergency department and emergency assessment unit on Wednesday and told the trust of 'safeguarding concerns'. Following the unannounced visit the watchdog found patients being inappropriately restrained, sedated without consent and do not resuscitate signs being ignored, the Guardian reported. A major incident has reportedly been declared at Colchester Hospital over 'safeguarding concerns' raised by the Care Quality Commission . Professor Mike Richards, the CQC's chief inspector, told the newspaper that they had carried out the unannounced inspection following 'concerns.' 'Following the inspection, we gave feedback to the trust about our safeguarding concerns so that it could take appropriate action to ensure the safety and wellbeing of its patients,' he told the Guardian. A spokesman for the hospital trust said it could not responded to the specific allegations made by the Guardian because they had not seen the CQC's full report . In July the CQC gave the hospital an overall rating of 'requires improvement'. Peter Wilson, acting chairman of Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust told the Guardian it was facing 'unprecedented demand' on its services. Professor Mike Richards, the CQC's chief executive, said they carried out the surprise inspection in response to concerns . The trust's interim chief executive, Dr Lucy Moore, said it was 'a difficult time for the trust'. She said: 'The Care Quality Commission raised a small number of safeguarding concerns when its team gave immediate feedback at the end of the inspection on Wednesday. 'The Trust takes safeguarding extremely seriously and is now investigating to find out whether our policies had been followed appropriately.' In the wake of the announcement more staff were said to have been drafted into the hospital, non urgent surgery rescheduled and where safe to do so patients discharged. Mr Wilson said they were disappointed that the CQC felt the situation at the hospital had not improved, and confirmed it had declared a major incident to review various aspects of service at the hospital. The trust said the major incident is likely to last a week, and appealed to members of the public only to visit the accident and emergency department if they have a 'serious or life-threatening condition'. The CQC said it will publish its latest report on the hospital 'in due course', and added that it will carry out further inspections at the trust. The major incident was declared at the hospital the day after Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, announced that the NHS was to receive an additional £300 million to help them cope this winter.","Major incident reportedly declared at Colchester Hospital following inspection .

"Scott Parker covered £20,000 in fines handed out to two young Fulham players by Felix Magath as he felt their punishment was too harsh. The revelation is the latest in a string of bizarre incidents that have come to light in the aftermath of the German manager's sacking from the west London club. The Mirror claim that Magath punished two younger members of Fulham's squad, handing them each a £10,000 fine. Scott Parker paid £20,000 in fines on behalf of two Fulham teenagers who had been unfairly punished . Fulham's captain went to discuss the matter with Magath and said that, although their actions may have deserved punishment, the level of the fines was disproportionately high. Both of the players were thought to be less than £2,000 a week, making the fines, at best, close to 10 per cent of their yearly wage packet. But Magath refused to change his mind on the matter and so the 33-year-old Parker paid the fines himself. Felix Magath had handed out the fines and refused to drop them even after Parker queried the decision . Fulham's owner Shahid Khan sacked Magath after the club's poor start to the season. The Cottagers had taken just one point from their first seven games. Khan expressed regret over having to take such action but said: 'I am doing what I feel is right and needed for Fulham, for today as well as tomorrow.' Former Wales and Fulham defender Kit Symons was installed as his replacement on a temporary basis.

"It was a genius ATM hack that allowed two Tennessee men to steal $400,000 in cash. But in the end it was a stupid move that got them both caught and charged with 30 counts of computer fraud and conspiracy. Khaled Abdel Fattah, a Nashville restaurateur and chef, and his accomplice Chris Folad are alleged to have used a six-digit default passcodes to cash out money over the course of 18 months in Nashville. Fattah had insider knowledge of the codes that are set by the makers of the ATMs, according to Help Net Security. When typed in, the ATMs would revert to 'Operator Mode'. Fraud charges: Nashville retsaurateur Khaled Abdel Fattah (left) and accomplice Chris Folad are alleged to have used a six-digit default passcode to cash out money $400,000 from convenience store ATMs in Nashville over the course of 18 months . The pair were then able to access the settings and reconfigure the ATM to dispense $20 when asked for $1. They would insert their own cards, request a $20 withdrawal, and walk away with $400 cash. The two targeted smaller kiosk or convenience store ATMs around Nashville - larger banks would not have used the same passcode - and they would revert the settings back to normal after each transaction. It took over a year for anyone to notice. Finally the owner of a business where one of the ATMs was stationed complained something was wrong. Customers were withdrawing money and nothing was coming out. The Secret Service became involved once it was clear this was a major exploit. They were able to track down Fattah and Folad because they had used the same network of small-time ATMs for their scheme. The duo were caught on surveillance camera and, most crucially, had used their own debit cards. Fattah owns the Blu Fig Mediterranean Kitchen in Nashville, a somewhat esteemed establishment. He was indicted on October 22 and has not commented on the charges . Neither has Folad. The default pass-codes of ATMs became a problem around 2005 when it was revealed they had been printed in the service manuals for the Tranax and Trident ATMs, according to Wired. Those manual were available online. Triton’s master pass-code was '123456'. Security was amped up in the aftermath. However in June, two 14-year-old boys in Winnipeg, Canada, who were playing around on the internet, found out how to figure out the default pass-code of a Bank of Montreal ATM in a grocery store. The teenagers successfully guessed the six-digit code and called the bank to let them know.","Nashville restaurateur Khaled Fattah and accomplice Chris Folad allegedly used a factor-set default code to reconfigure remote ATMs in Nashville .

"Steven Rolfe painted the red and white colours of the English flag on his rented home in 2003 but was told ten years later he had to cover it up as it could be considered offensive . For ten years, Steven Rolfe has displayed the flag with pride. But far from making him a patriotic citizen, his unorthodox St George’s banner has seen him branded a ‘nuisance neighbour’. The 52-year-old former soldier painted the red and white symbol on his front door in 2003 yet only now have his landlords decided it is ‘offensive’ and must go. He has 14 days to remove it – or face eviction.Mr Rolfe, who served in Northern Ireland in the 1980s, said: ‘I’ve had this for ten years and nobody has said anything until now. ‘My landlords, Places for People, sent me a letter saying it could be deemed offensive, and that I was breaking my agreement over a nuisance. ‘I wrote back, asking for retrospective permission because it’s been there so long, but they weren’t interested. 'I’m ex-forces and I’m proud to be English. I’m not in the EDL or any other racist group. I’m very angry about this, and I won’t be changing anything. I want my day in court.’ The enforcement notice has sparked outrage among Mr Rolfe’s neighbours in Preston and Muslim groups have criticised the housing company’s stance. Ali Anwar, a Muslim  representative on the Preston faith forum, said: ‘As far as I’m concerned, a man’s home is his castle, and he should be allowed to express himself as he wishes. ‘This is political correctness gone mad. As a Muslim it really frustrates me that organisations become overly politically correct and make issues and tensions where there aren’t any. They don’t speak for the Muslim community. ‘The flag of St George needs to be reclaimed from the far right. There is nothing offensive about the flag and anyone who is proud to be English should be able to fly it.’ David Borrow, a former Labour MP who is now a local councillor, said: ‘The door has been like that a long time and, having spoken to the gentleman, I have no reason to believe that he is anything other than a decent member of the community. The letter warned Mr Rolfe the design could place him in a catagory of 'nuisance neighbour' and said it could mean him being evicted if he failed to cover it up . ‘I do not believe that he has intended the door to symbolise anything offensive, and I have heard no specific complaints. ‘There are other doors in the city that have flags painted on to them, and there appear to be no problems at all.’ John Clemence, who is vice-president . of the Royal Society of St George, said: ‘To say that the cross of St . George can cause offence needs to be challenged. ‘We are seeing more and more of this kind of complaint, and these jobsworths are causing resentment and inciting racial hatred.’ Places for People, which owns Mr . Rolfe’s house, has since apologised for calling the flag offensive but . insists its tenant must repaint the door because he did not have the . proper permission to turn it into an England flag. Places for People has since apologised for calling the flag 'offensive' but said Mr Rolfe must still repaint the door because he does not have the proper permission .

The travails of England’s besieged cricket captain Alastair Cook include a commercial deal that has landed him in trouble with the England and Wales Cricket Board and the FA. After the Ashes success last summer, Cook became an ambassador for upmarket menswear brand Kent & Curwen and is the face of their winter campaign, modelling a range of clothing. But the deal clashes with England’s clothing partnerships with TM Lewin and adidas and a communication breakdown between the ECB and Cook’s agents Paragon meant it wasn’t established if it conflicts with his central contract obligations. You wear it well: Alastair Cook's sponsorship deal with Kent & Curwen has upset the ECB and the FA . To add to the fuss, both the ECB and the FA have intellectual property rights issues with the Kent & Curwen branding and pictures including the Three Lions badge. The wrangling has gone on throughout the 5-0 Ashes whitewash and proved an avoidable distraction for the England captain, whose mind looked scrambled by the Sydney Test where he was twice out cheaply. The ECB are intent on protecting their sponsorship partners’ rights but a spokesman said: ‘We hope we can come to a settlement soon that will be agreeable to all parties.’ Sir Ian Botham, England’s legendary warrior all-rounder, may be mortal after all. He suffered a heart problem during the second Test at Adelaide while working for Sky Sports and later missed a day’s cricket to have defibrillator treatment. However, the brief health setback hasn’t stopped Botham working and playing hard, as well as promoting red wine from wherever he might be during the innings interval of Australian Channel 10’s Big Bash coverage.

Vaughan, who made his debut on C9 during the Ashes, impressed enough for the Aussies to want to use him on non-England matches as well. Kevin Pietersen, who is not going to win any ‘him or me’ confrontation with Andy Flower, continues to infuriate senior members of the ECB with his ‘man apart’ attitude. This includes refusing to drive a sponsors’ Jaguar to England matches like the other centrally contracted players — preferring his own ‘Chelsea tractor’ — so that he doesn’t have to commit to any Jaguar personal appearances. And this at a time when the Aussie cricketers’ availability to sponsors and media is in marked contrast to England’s insular approach. Lone ranger: Kevin Pietersen continues to infuriate the ECB with his 'man apart' attitude . Former Football League commercial chief Richard Heaselgrave may have jumped before he was pushed. His role had been under scrutiny since the League lost a bumper title sponsorship with B&Q at the last minute and had to replace it on reduced terms with Sky Bet. Heaselgrave, who applied for the CEO’s post that went to Shaun Harvey, also hasn’t delivered a promised play-off sponsor.

"A new book has finally laid bare the full horrors of the Battle Of Stalingrad in the words of ordinary Russian soldiers, whose memories were suppressed by the Soviet authorities for 70 years. The Stalingrad Protocols gathers interviews with hundreds of veterans that Russia had deemed too graphic to publish after the Second World War because only heroism was lauded. Historians believe the book, compiled by the German historian Jochen Hellbeck, will change the way the world views the six-month 1942-43 battle that cost over a million men their lives and forever destroyed Hitler's ambitions to colonise the Soviet Union. Truth be told: A new book has finally laid bare the full horrors of the Battle Of Stalingrad in the words of ordinary Russian soldiers, whose memories were suppressed by the Soviet authorities for 70 years . Appalling casualties: German prisoners of war captured by the Russians march in a long line winding over a hill toward a prison camp near Stalingrad . Professor Hellbeck gained access to nearly 10,000 pages of documents in the history department archives at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He claims the interviews demolish the myth that the Red Army only fought out of fear and that over 13,000 soldiers were executed for cowardice - in fact, the real number was lower than 300. And the book has graphic and illuminating details about the disintegration of the German 6th Army - the conquerors of Poland and France - at Stalingrad, some of whom were reduced to cannibalism in order to stay alive in the ruins of the city as the mercury plunged to -40c below. The bloodiest battle in Second World War came to an end on January 31, 1943 when Field Marshall Friedrich Paulus surrendered, disobeying the orders of his Fuhrer to kill himself. Lieutenant Colonel Leonid Vinokur was the first to catch sight of Paulus and his recollection is published for the first time in the book. He said: 'Paulus lay on the bed when I entered. He lay there in his coat, with his cap on. He had two-week-old beard stubble and seemed to have lost all courage.' His aide, Major Anatloy Zoldatov, recalled: 'The filth and human excrement and who knows what else was piled up waist-high. It stank beyond belief. There were two toilets and signs above them both that read: ""No Russians allowed"".' 'They could have easily shot themselves,' said Major General Ivan Burmakov. 'But Paulus and his staff chose not to do that. They had no intention of dying - they were such cowards. They didn't have the courage to die.' Turning point: The six-month 1942-43 battle cost over a million men their lives and forever destroyed Hitler's ambitions to colonise the Soviet Union . Intense fighting: The bloodiest battle in Second World War came to an end on January 31, 1943 when Field Marshall Friedrich Paulus surrendered, disobeying the orders of his Fuhrer to kill himself . Hitler was obsessed with the city that bore the name of his Communist nemesis and wanted it taken at all costs. Equally, the Russians decided to hold it at all costs, and did so. The battle for Stalingrad became a primitive slugging match in ruined houses, cellars and bunkers. Between half and a million Russian men lost their lives, and 150,000 Germans. Of the 110,000 Germans who surrendered, only 5,000 would survive Stalin's gulags to return to a defeated Germany. The battle cost the German army a quarter of everything it possessed by way of material - guns, tanks and munitions. It was a defeat from which it never recovered and for days afterwards in Berlin all shops and restaurants were closed as a mark of respect. The Stalingrad Protocols adds a human dimension to 'Private Ivan', who has for decades been portrayed in the West as a man who fought with a Communist gun at his back. While there were executions, they were far below Western estimates. The papers show that many Russians fought with a fanatical fervour because of the Nazi atrocities they had seen on the road to Stalingrad. 'One sees the young girls, the children, who hang from the trees in the park,' said sniper Vasily Zaytsev, adding that 'this has a tremendous impact'. Major Pyotr Zayonchovsky told of a position that the Germans had abandoned. When he arrived there, he discovered the body of a dead comrade 'whose skin and fingernails on his right hand had been completely torn off. The eyes had been burnt out and he had a wound on his left temple made by a red-hot piece of iron. The right half of his face had been covered with a flammable liquid and ignited.' Cost of Stalingrad: Between half and a million Russian men lost their lives, and 150,000 Germans also perished . Russian defence: Communist Party card-carrying soldiers were usually the first into battle to encourage the others . Major Zayonchovsky described the nature of 'the Germans' as follows: 'The robber mentality has become such second nature to them that they have to steal - whether they can use it or not.' Political officers assigned to the Red Army boosted fighting morale by convincing the ordinary soldier that their's was a struggle for the civilians behind the lines who the Nazis wanted to enslave. Communist Party card-carrying soldiers were usually the first into battle to encourage the others. Brigade Commissar Vasilyev said: 'It was viewed as a disgrace if a Communist was not the first to lead the solders into battle.' At the front in Stalingrad, the number of card-carrying party members rose between August and October 1942 from 28,500 to 53,500. Political officers distributed fliers in the battle zone portraying the 'hero of the day', including large photos of the honored soldiers. 'At night,' said Lieutenant Colonel Yakov Dubrovsky, 'the fighters are more inclined to speak openly, and one can crawl inside their souls.' The Stalingrad Protocols . Battalion Commissar Pyotr Molchanov said: 'A soldier is stuck in the trenches for an entire month. He doesn't see anyone aside from his neighbour, and suddenly the commissar approaches him, tells him something, says a friendly word to him, greets him. This is of enormous importance.' But soldiers need material comforts too and the paperwork shows how the hard pressed infantrymen received chocolate and mandarins and games to play, such as draughts and dominoes. 'The aim was for the soldiers to no longer be driven by fear, but instead to use their political awareness to overcome their distress,' said the Professor Hellbeck. 'Consequently, the Communists saw it as a sign of weakness when captured German soldiers described themselves as apolitical. In their opinion, the true will to win could only be developed by those who believed they served a higher purpose. 'The Communists saw the Red Army as more politically and morally steadfast than the Wehrmacht.' According to Captain Nikolay Aksyonov, one could feel 'how every soldier and every commander was itching to kill as many Germans as possible'. The sniper Anatoly Chechov told of his despair when he shot his first German. He said: 'I felt terrible. I had killed a human being. But then I thought of our people - and I started to mercilessly fire on them. I've become a barbaric person, I kill them. I hate them.' When he was interviewed, he had already killed 40 Germans - most of them with a shot to the head. Vasily Zaytsev, the Red Army's best sniper at Stalingrad, who was played in the Hollywood movie Enemy At The Gates by Jude Law, shot 242 Germans, but said after the battle was over: 'You often have to remember, and the memory has a powerful impact. Now, I have unsteady nerves and I'm constantly shaking.' This did not fit in with Communist ideals of glory and so his comments were suppressed in the archives until accessed by Professor Hellbeck.

"A convicted school shooter and two other Ohio inmates managed to get inside a prison's maintenance area and spent several months building a makeshift ladder to escape, it has been revealed. T.J Lane, 20, who is serving a life sentence for killing three of his classmates at Chardon High School near Cleveland in 2012, then used it to scale the fence of Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima before jumping 15 feet to freedom in September. Along with Lindsey Bruce and Clifford E. Opperud, they dispersed and ran through the fields surrounding the facility, but the trio were all caught within hours. Scroll down for video . Bid for freedom: Video footage shows two inmates, one of them convicted school shooter T.J Lane breaking out of Allen Oakwood Correctional Institute in Lima, Ohio . The three prisoners, one had run in a different direction used a makeshift ladder built inside the prison's maintenance unit to scale the fence before jumping 15ft to freedom . Caught: Lindsey Bruce, who kidnapped and killed a five-year-old girl in 2004, was the first to be caught just minutes after he had scaled the prison walls . The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction's investigation also found that a security camera at the unit where the escape happened wasn't working because of an earlier lightning strike and that some lighting near the prison needed to be repaired. Lane, who wore a T-shirt with the word 'killer' scrawled on it at his sentencing hearing last year, was captured in a wooded area about six hours after the prison break on September 11. Reports suggested that he armed himself with a pitchfork during the escape attempt. Bruce, who is serving a life sentence for killing a five-year-old girl, was found within minutes just outside. The third Clifford E. Opperud, sentenced to 12 years for a home invasion, was discovered hiding under a boat across the road nine hours after the escape. T.J. Lane, who was convicted of killing three of his classmates in a school cafeteria was one of the prisoners who tried to escape by building a ladder and scaling the fence . He wore a t-shirt saying killer during his sentencing and was disrespectful to the victims' families . A video released by the corrections department showed all three running through a soybean field just outside the prison fence. The inmates were able to open a padlock on a door to the maintenance area, the report said. They got into a maintenance access area, described in the report as being similar to a crawl space, where they built the ladder. Fifteen months before the escape a prison guard wrote in a report that he found discarded wooden cabinets in the maintenance access area, according to the internal investigation. The state's investigation did not say what the ladder was built from or how the inmates were able to move it without being detected. The recreation yard where the escape took place has been closed. Accomplices: Lindsey Bruce (left) is one of the three Ohio inmates who were able to escape from prison during recreation. He was caught immediately. Clifford E. Opperud (right) was nabbed hours later . The prison department said it has since repaired lighting at the prison, updated the alarm system and added razor ribbon on top of the administration building and other areas. The state also has reassigned the warden at the prison and demoted the deputy warden. All three inmates involved in the escape have since been moved to the so-called Supermax state prison in Youngstown. Lane wasn't charged with escape because he has no chance to be released and the families of his victims didn't want him to have an opportunity to mock them again, a prosecutor said last month. Lindsey Bruce, who also is serving a life sentence, was not charged with escape either. Clifford Opperud was sentenced just over a week ago to five additional years. He was already serving time for robbery, burglary and kidnapping. In addition to at least three other offenses for which Lane has been punished in past months, the cold-blooded teen killer has been found guilty of the following disorderliness: . August 2014: Lane was cited for urinating on an Allen Correctional Institution prison wall . October 2013: Lane disobeyed a prison work order and lost 10 days recreation time . August 2013: Lane refused to follow through with a work assignment and was verbally reprimanded . July 2013: Lane was separated from the general population for 10 days as punishment for giving himself a tattoo . Changes: The warden at Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima, Ohio, has been reassigned following the escape effort and their deputy has been demoted . Precautions: The authorities announced that more barbed wire would be installed around the prison in the wake of the escape .","T.J Lane, 20, got into the maintenance area of Allen Oakwood Correctional Institutional in Lima, Ohio, over several months .

"You may not have heard of Palermo striker Paulo Dybala until recently but the young Argentine is drawing plenty of attention this season. Dubbed the 'new Sergio Aguero', the young Argentine is currently being watched by Manchester United and has been tipped for superstardom by former Red Devils coach Phil Neville. Rated at £30million, the 21-year-old can play on the right wing or as a striker and has impressed during this, his breakthrough season in Serie A, scoring eleven goals. Here, Sportsmail tells you everything you need to know about the latest exciting talent from South America about to take Europe by storm. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Paulo Dybala's best goals for first club Instituto . Palermo frontman Paulo Dybala is a target for Manchester United and has been watched by the Red Devils . Early Years . Paulo Dybala began his career with hometown club Instituto in Argentina's second division. Nicknamed the Jewel, Dybala played 38 consecutive games during his debut season for the club and managed 17 goals. Beating Mario Kempes' record as Instituto's youngest-ever goalscorer at the age of 17,  Dybala had truly announced his arrival with nearly a goal every two matches. Not a bad ratio for a teenager during his first-ever campaign. Clubs across Europe, including Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, were said to have started to take notice. Dybala, pictured scoring for Palermo this season, broke a number of records in his homeland of Argentina . Dybala became Instituto's youngest goalscorer aged 17, breaking the record of Argentina hero Mario Kempes . Palermo . Dybala made the move to Europe in April 2012, signing for Italian side Palermo for a fee of £9million. Club president Maurizio Zamparini was quick to put the youngster on a pedestal and proclaimed: 'We have got Paulo Dybala.. the new Sergio Aguero'. No pressure then. However, after managing just three goals in his debut season as Palermo were relegated, Dybala only registered a further five strikes as the Eagles won promotion at the first time of asking. Dybala, nicknamed 'The Jewel', has been dubbed the new Sergio Aguero by Palermo's club president . Back in the Italian top-flight this season, Dybala has flourished alongside compatriot Franco Vazquez and has already scored eleven goals this term including strikes against AC Milan and Roma. 'This year he has exploded, but I already knew that he was very good,' said Zamparini. 'Dybala is worth over €40m but I won't sell him until June. Many foreign clubs asked after him, including Manchester United. 'I told the English side that he is not for sale right now, but we can talk about it again in six months. In my view, he is the best striker in Europe at the moment.' High praise indeed. Dybala has scored eleven Serie A goals for Palermo this season having joined the club for £9m in April 2012 . Playing style . Boasting exquisite close control with a quick turn of pace, the Argentine loves to run at defenders. Never the tallest player on the pitch, Dybala stands at 5ft10 but has shown he can compete; showing his strength against opponents this term in order to work his way into goalscoring positions. Predominantly left-footed, the attacker, who doesn't turn 22 until November, is direct and an exceptional finisher capable of forcing his way goalwards with a host of tricks and skills. Nutmegs, jinking runs and even keepy-uppies whilst on the move, Dybala loves to cut inside when deployed on the right wing. The 21-year-old Argentine boasts exquisite close control, loves to run at defenders and is a tidy finisher . Dybala is predominantly left-footed but can operate as a right winger where he likes to cut inside . Tipped for superstardom . Touted as the next Aguero by his current club president, Dybala is certainly a talent. However, the forward has also received praise from outside the Stadio Renzo Barbera. Speaking to Sportsmail's Matt Lawton earlier this year, former Manchester United player and coach Phil Neville said shortly after a trip to watch Palermo take on Genoa: 'There’s a player at Palermo who is going to be a superstar, by the way. Paulo Dybala. Remember that name.' Having played with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham, Neville knows a supreme talent when he sees one. Former Man United player and coach Phil Neville tipped Dybala for stardom during a Sportsmail interview . International scene . Born in Argentina, Dybala is yet to earn an international cap but is eligible to play for Poland, through his grandfather, as well as Italy. However, the young frontman has already spoken of his desire to play for the country of his birth and cites former Argentina playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme as one of his heroes. Also an admirer of Ronaldinho, Dybala claims he likes to play for the fun of football. With the likes of Aguero, Lionel Messi, Carlos Tevez and Gonzalo Higuain to choose from up front, Dybala will have proven his credentials should he finally earn a call up from the national side. Former Argentina playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme, who retired this year, is one of Dybala's biggest idols .","Manchester United are keeping tabs on Palermo striker Paulo Dybala .

"The last surviving member of a trio of three British brothers fighting for al-Qaeda in Syria says he will not return home because jihad requires 'commitment'. Amer Deghayes, 20, has vowed to stay in the Middle East until 'all Muslim lands' are 'ruled by Islam', despite the deaths of his brothers Abdullah, 18, and Jaffar, 17. Amer left his hometown of Brighton almost a year ago in order to work in Syria as part of an aid convoy, but began fighting for al-Nusra, an al-Qaeda linked group. Amer Deghayes, 20, has vowed to stay in Syria and keep fighting until all Muslim lands are 'ruled by Islam' despite his brothers Abdullah, 18, and Jaffar, 17, being killed . Abdullah, 18 (left), was killed fighting in Lakatia province in April after being shot in the chest by a sniper, while Jaffar, 17, died in a battle near Aleppo three weeks ago . His brothers joined him earlier this year after sneaking out of the family home, but Abdullah was killed by a sniper in Lakatia in April, while Jaffar died fighting last month. Asked if he would return home to spare his parents any more heartbreak, Amer replied: 'Nope. Jihad nowadays isn't for tasters, it's a commitment. 'Not until all Muslim lands are liberated from infidels and is ruled by Islam then I can think about it. 'If I want to come back I will and no one can stop me except for Allah. If the whole world unites against you, they can't have an effect. Only Allah can.' Since travelling to Syria, Amer has been in regular contact with his parents Abubaker Deghayes and Einas Abulsayen via Skype. It was during two such phonecalls that be broke the news that his brothers had been killed. The first call came in April. Speaking about Abdullah's death at the time, Mr Deghayes said: 'Amer told me Abdullah advanced into territory of the Syrian army then a sniper shot him in the chest. 'He fell on the ground and looked at the sky and laughed. You feel he died a good death as a Muslim. As a martyr, he goes to paradise. But at the same time you feel sad for the loss.' Amer (centre) went to Syria in October last year with an aid convoy but soon joined al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda linked group. Brothers Abdullah (left), and Jaffar (right) followed him early this year . Asked whether he would return to his home in Brighton to save father Abubaker (pictured) more heartbreak, Amer replied: 'Nope. Jihad nowadays isn't for tasters, it's a commitment.' Three weeks ago Mr Deghayes got another call, this time to say Jaffar was dead. Mr Deghayes added: 'I can only hope and pray to God to accept him and have mercy on him.’ Yesterday David Cameron outlined new powers to prevent British jihadists who travel abroad to fight from returning to the UK. The Prime Minister said the special exclusion orders, which could last for more than two years, would stop fighters returning to the country unless they agreed to strict conditions. Under the Temporary Exclusion Orders, Brits suspected of fighting with radical Islamist militants would be stopped from re-entering the UK unless they gave themselves up at the border. The returning jihadis would have their passports cancelled and their names added to a no-fly list that would prevent them from travelling back to this country. They would only be allowed to return if they agreed to be escorted by police before facing prosecution or close supervision under monitoring laws.","Amer Deghayes, 20, travelled to Syria to fight for al-Queda group last year .

"Paula Radcliffe has hit out at a German documentary maker for not handing over documents he claims show a famous British athlete gave suspicious blood samples. Investigative journalist Hajo Seppelt alleged an IAAF Medical Commission whistleblower had provided him with a list of 150 athletes who gave suspicious samples between 2006 and 2008 - including a famous British name - that were not followed up by drugs testers. But despite several requests from the sport’s governing body the IAAF, Seppelt has not shared his list and Radcliffe, who has campaigned against drugs cheats throughout her long career, is angry. Paula Radcliffe has hit out at Hajo Seppelt for not passing the alleged list of 150 athletes  on to the IAAF . Paula Radcliffe breaks the world marathon record with a time of 2hrs 15mins and 25secs in London in 2003 . ‘This makes me so mad because he won’t give it to the IAAF,’ said the marathon world record holder. ‘The IAAF have no idea what he is talking about. 'They (the IAAF) won’t come out and say “we have nothing, none of our records show any of these people that you’re talking about” because no journalist has given them this list.’ Sportsmail, along with other newspapers, was shown the list by Seppelt in the media centre in Monaco during the IOC Congress. Apart from the red marking against the British name, there was no other purported evidence detailed or actual blood values listed. And this list that has caused such controversy, wasn’t printed on official IAAF paper. Radcliffe strides out from the start line before her record-breaking feat in London that day . Seppelt said when showing around his list: 'I trust the source of these documents 100 per cent. They are genuine.' Radcliffe was asked during a promotional appearance this week for the Great Manchester Run whether people have suspected her of doping during her career despite her great anti-drugs reputation. She said: ‘Yes, I get it all the time.It does make you angry and it does make you think we have to put a system in place that protects those clean athletes. And also so that people watching can believe in it.’ Radcliffe celebrates following her seismic achievement after the 2003 London Marathon . In his documentary for German channel ARD, he also exposed a serial drugs scandal in Russia claiming 99 per cent of Russian athletes used banned substances as part of a state-sponsored regime. The IAAF insisted they have yet to see the list and are now consulting their lawyers about whether to take action against Seppelt. A spokesman said: 'No-one at the IAAF has seen any list. We have repeatedly asked to see this list so that we are able to verify if this is, indeed an IAAF list at all and also to date it properly, because we did not consider information on blood data very reliable until 2009 when technology had evolved to the point where we were comfortable about introducing our Athletes Biological Passport. ‘Since we are now working with WADA we will request that WADA ask for this list so that it can be independently reviewed by them. We hope that this will help clear up misunderstandings about what this list contains, as well as to allow the IAAF to demonstrate what actions were, or were not, taken.’","Journalist Hajo Seppelt was allegedly given list of 150 athletes who gave suspicious blood samples between 2006 and 2008 .

"A  fraudster who won a contract from New York City to clean up after Ebola grossly exaggerated his experience after 'scamming' the grieving relatives of a haz-mat expert, a new report claims. Salvatore Pane, 32, the chief safety officer of Bio Recovery corporation, was called in when Dr Craig Spencer was diagnosed with Ebola to eradicate the disease from places he'd been. Photographs of him taping perimeters around Spencer's Harlem apartment, handling barrels of waste and speaking to news crews were beamed around the world, while in interviews he boasted of having 27 years' experience and took credit for cleaning up after anthrax attacks in the wake of 9/11. Public face of Ebola cleanup: Salvatore Pane, pictured setting up a perimeter around an active Ebola cleanup, reportedly 'scammed' relatives of a dead haz-mat professional to get into the trusted position . Riding to the rescue: Pane appeared on television and radio interviews in the wake of the cleanup, and his image was beamed across the world. Bio Recovery, the company he is associated with, has not been given any work by New York City since Pane's past emerged . In front of camera, behind bars: In 2010/11 Pane was serving jail time for drunk driving. He was also fined in connection a company which took advantage of people struggling with mortgages in the Credit Crunch . But, according to an investigation by BuzzFeed News, Pane has a criminal history, a track record of exaggerating credentials, and during the clean-up was using vehicles and permits registered to a dead man, whose family now feel 'scammed'. On October 24, the day after Dr Spencer was diagnosed with Ebola, Pane was on the scene at his West 147th Street home, and also at The Gutter bowling alley in Williamsburg, where Spencer visited the night before. He gave interviews to TV news explaining his work, and went out of his way to bring up how 'we' cleaned up after an Anthrax attack in 2001, the week after 9/11. But shortly after his heroic turn, BuzzFeed News published an exposé, revealing that in 2008 he had been president of a company that claimed to helped customers trapped by distressed mortgages, and fleeced them of their fees. Media darling: In a photograph posted on Bio Recovery's Facebook page, Pane is interviewed by a reporter from NBC . An injunction was issued against Pane's businesses and he himself was fined. It was also revealed that Pane had served time in jail for driving while drunk - even getting himself re-arrested outside a courthouse after driving himself to the case while his licence. In the wake of the revelation, City Hall officials in New York distances themselves from Pane and Bio Recovery, and said he would be getting no more work from them. There is no suggestion that Pane - who changed his name to Pain after getting out of jail in March 2011 - did not complete the Ebola clean-up properly. But now more detail has emerged about how Pane came to be in a position to be entrusted with defending New Yorkers from a potential pandemic. City Hall has said that Bio Recovery had been doing jobs for them on and off over the past six years - when the company was founded by former paramedic Ron Gospodarski in 1998. Gospodarski ran the reputable company until he got sick 2013 and died. In his will he left the company to Fran Gospodarski Senko, his sister. Gospodarski Senko told BuzzFeed how Pane called her out of the blue months after her brother died, claiming to be a business associate. He asked for passwords to accounts -and negotiated buying an ambulance and a box truck he had used, which featured haz-mat permits which he claimed were almost identical to his own. He later followed up by asking her sell him the company itself, to save on costly bureaucracy and administration. Gospodarski Senko recalled him saying: 'If you just sign the corporation over, it'll save me money.' Although no official records show Pane as the owner, former employees claim he was clearly the boss, and said that he deliberately kept his name off any official records because of his past. Nonetheless, he went on to continue Bio Recovery's line of work, and boasted in interviews of having '27 year's experience' - which would have meant his bio hazard career began aged four. Employees and associates of Gospodarski all say they had never heard of Pane until recently. After seeing Pane claim credit for the company her brother built, Gospodarski Senko said she felt 'stupid' for trusting him. She told BuzzFeed: 'I can't even grieve for my brother,' she said, 'and he's out there pulling my corporation from underneath my nose.... When you get scammed like this, I mean - I can't believe it.' In response to previous allegations, Pane had said: 'I hope I’ve done what I’ve had to do to rebuild my life. I’m not a bad guy.' But he declined to comment in detail on the latest revelations, and told reporters who contacted him to 'grow up'.","Salvatore Pane, 32, rode to the rescue when Ebola struck last month .

Afterwards, Moyes — who was taunted by a man dressed as the Grim Reaper in the crowd — claimed he was happy with the display. He . said: ‘We played well in the first half but conceded two on the . counter-attack. We didn’t deserve to be 2-0 down. We had good control of . the game and possession of the ball.

You can’t . see what the plan is. When I played it was total dominance from . Manchester United. I’m looking at this team and wondering why they . didn’t play like that when I was playing.’ Moyes . was even criticised on the club's in-house TV channel when pundit David .

I put a . blanket over him. The paramedics were talking to me on the phone and . told me to check his breathing but I didn't want to touch his wee body. 'My neighbour, is too upset to speak. I can't get it out of my head now. It's a tragic day. God bless him. He . was only four years old. It's absolutely tragic.' Karen Cowan, 52, who lives across the street from the block of flats, said yesterday: 'I heard about it this morning. 'I see his mum walking to the shops now and again.

"Today presenter Karl Stefanovic conducted a year-long experiment into the sexism faced by his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson by wearing the same suit every day for a year. Stefanovic said he was concerned by the level of criticism women received for their style, especially fellow Today presenter Lisa Wilkinson, and friend Samantha Amytage, co-host of rival breakfast program Sunrise. In order to test whether viewers would notice his choice of wardrobe, Stefanovic decided to wear his imitation Burberry suit to present Today, and ended up wearing it for a whole year without incident. Scroll down for video . Today presenter Karl Stefanovic conducted a year-long experiment into the sexism faced by his his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson by wearing the same suit for a year . If the imitation Burberry suit fits, wear it...all year long . Stefanovic in his blue suit with Wilkinson and Paul Hogan on the set of the Today show. Stefanovic said 'No one has noticed; no one gives a s**t,' reported The Sydney Morning Herald. One observant clothing store did notice that Stefanovic enjoyed wearing his blue suit 'a little too much.' In 2012, Briggins, a bespoke suit store, commented that Stefanovic might need help from the men's clothing store. 'Has anyone else noticed Karl Stefanovic wears that blue suit of his a little too much? We think BRIGGINS might have to add some more variety to his wardrobe!' Briggins posted on their company Facebook page. Stefanovic said that he hadn't received any feedback about his serial suit wearing, in contrast to the barrage of comments his female co-hosts experienced. 'Women, they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up. They say the wrong thing and there's thousands of tweets written about them.' Stefanovic has witnessed firsthand the treatment of his co-host Wilkinson, who has been the target of harsh comments regarding her style. Stefanovic said 'No one has noticed; no one gives a s**t' Karl Stefanovic congratulating Richard Wilkins on being made a Member of the Order of Australia . Stefanovic in the same blue knock-off Burberry suit with co-host Lisa Wilkinson and Tim Cahill . 'Women are judged much more harshly and keenly for what they do, what they say and what they wear,' said Stefanovic. His frustration at this, he says, sparked his experiment. 'I've worn the same suit on air for a year – except for a couple of times because of circumstance – to make a point,' he said. 'I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humour – on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is ... that's [what I wanted to test].' Social media users labeled the experience 'magnificent', 'fabulous' and called the Today host 'a legend'  and 'as big as Kim Kardashian's butt'. 'Women, they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up. They say the wrong thing and there's thousands of tweets written about them.' Others wondered whether the message would make any impact, and commented that women in the media could not avoid being criticised. 'Stefanovic has shown, no matter what a man chooses to wear within a limited scope he will not be examined by the public. Female talk show hosts do not have that option. That's the point I think is being made. Female talk show hosts cannot escape this scrutiny,' said one Twitter user. Another pointed out that 'Female talk show hosts constantly have their wardrobe choices and bodies examined by the public. This is a consequence of being female. Being female in the workplace means there is no single way of dressing, so there is no escaping the criticism or admiration of the public.'","Australian TV host, Karl Stefanovic, wore same suit every day for a year .

"Middle school students were left traumatized after police officers burst into their classroom in the middle of the day with their guns drawn during an unannounced 'shooter drill.' The police officers from Winter haven, Florida carried out the exercise to see how well students at Jewett Middle Academy would cope if a crazed gunman entered their school. But the stunt left parents, students and teachers furious as no one knew that it was going to take place ahead of time - except for the school's principal. Shooting: Police officers wanted to see how well students  would cope if a crazed gunman entered their school . Hands up: Police officers burst into a classroom at Jewett Middle Academy in Florida armed with a AR-15 rifle . Texts: Frightened students began sending desperate texts to their parents because they thought they might die . Frightened students began sending desperate text messages to their parents because they thought that they might die. Their worried parents were only told about the drill by e-mail after it had taken place. Lauren Marionneaux, a seventh-grade student at Jewett Middle Academy, said it was about 9 a.m. Thursday when the principal announced the school was going on lockdown. Students huddled into classrooms waiting for further instructions and heard voices in the hallway. ‘A lot of people started getting scared because we thought it was a real drill,’ Marionneaux told Fox 13. ‘We actually thought that someone was going to come in there and kill us.’ Two police officers then burst into Marionneaux's classroom with their guns drawn -- one carrying, what Winter Haven police said, was an AR-15 rifle. Fear: Lauren Marionneaux, pictured, a seventh-grade student at Jewett Middle Academy, said students thought it was real . Another officer had  his duty firearm – a handgun – drawn and worryingly, it was  loaded, as required. The seventh grader said she panicked and sent a text to her mother, Stacy Ray, who was scared out of her mind because she too thought that the drill was real. She said: ‘I'm panicking because I'm thinking that it's a legitimate shooter [that] is coming, that something bad is happening at the school.’ Ray also received frightened text messages from her other children, including one that read, ‘I thought he was going to shoot me.’ But Winter Haven Police Chief Charlie Bird said that the surprise element of the drill was  what officers had planned. Worried: Mother, Stacy Ray, said she was scared out of her mind because she too thought that it was real . Bird told WTVT: 'It’s very important that, when you do your drill, you do it without everyone knowing that it’s a drill. ‘How you train and how you prepare is how you’re going to react when everything goes bad.’ He added: ‘It really is to protect the children and at no point in time would we endanger any of the children.’ Despite this, Ray and other parents feel it was extreme for police to have their guns drawn on kids. She added: ‘It's very scary, especially from a parent's perspective. You hear all this horrible stuff on the news and you think it might be happening at your child's school.’ Jason Geary, a spokesperson for Polk County Schools confirmed that it was standard procedure for these types of drills to take place without advanced warning to parents, students or teachers. Changes are being implemented in the wake of the devastating  Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012, in Newtown Connecticut, when Adam Lanza shot 20 kids and six teachers. States — including Tenessee, New Jersey and Missouri — will be carrying out active shooter drills in schools. Several businesses are also said to be adopting the tactic to train staff.","Police officers were testing the school's ability to cope with a shooter .

"A father relived the harrowing moment he had to step in and treat his dying son – after a female paramedic broke down in tears when she couldn’t get her equipment to work. Dwayne Cuming desperately attempted to revive ten-year-old asthma sufferer Harry, who began gasping for breath as he watched TV with his three-year-old brother, an inquest heard yesterday. Both his inhaler and a more powerful nebuliser failed to stop the attack, leaving the boy in tears as he sobbed: ‘Dad, dad it’s not working’ before collapsing on the floor. Traumatic: Dwayne Cuming (right), 39, attempted desperately to revive his ten-year-old son Harry (left) after the boy began gasping for breath whilst watching TV at home in Croston, Lancashire . Brothers: The tragedy occurred when Dwayne Cuming, Harry (right) and his other son Lewis (left), now three, had been watching TV after enjoying hot dogs bought from the supermarket . Although ambulance staff quickly arrived at the scene, one of the paramedics found she could not insert an endotracheal tube meant to clear his airways. Mr Cuming, 39, a mechanical engineer, said: ‘The paramedic couldn’t get the tube in. She couldn’t understand why, she was shaking and she started to cry.’ At this point Harry’s lips started to turn blue – forcing his terrified father to take charge and clear his son’s airways himself. 'Devastated': Harry's mother Vicky Cuming at the inquest into his death at Preston Coroner's Court . Improvising with a vacuum cleaner he inserted the nozzle down his airway in a last-ditch attempt to try and save his son. He told the hearing: ‘I suggested using a vacuum cleaner to clear his airways. Harry was occasionally gasping for breaths. ‘I managed to clear the airways by putting my hand down his throat and I carefully controlled the vacuum nozzle.’ The paramedics were still having trouble assembling their equipment, so Mr Cuming picked his son up and carried him to the ambulance waiting outside. He said: ‘I remember the paramedics trying to do something with the intervention tube. ‘I carried Harry to the ambulance, but they struggled to find a vein and were having difficulties assembling the suction pump.’ He added: ‘I went in to the ambulance, but none of the ambulance crew took over and they let me carry on.’ The paramedics eventually stepped in and rushed Harry to hospital, but he was pronounced dead 50 minutes later after suffering both cardiac and respiratory arrest. The inquest also heard that days before Harry’s death he had been admitted to hospital after having a serious asthma attack – but doctors had decided to discharge him without making any changes to his prescription. In the lead-up to his death he had been taken in for treatment in October and December 2010, as well as January, February, March and July 2011. On October 15 2011 he was sent to Preston Royal Hospital in Fulwood, Lancashire, after he started struggling to breathe. But Mr Cuming said the family had been ‘fobbed off’ by doctors who sent him home following a two-day stay without making any changes to his medication. Pronounced dead: The Accident and Emergency department at the Royal Preston Hospital where Harry died . He insisted that hospital staff had ignored changes in his son’s condition, adding: ‘The treatment Harry received clearly wasn’t working. ‘We asked for treatment reviews several times over the years but we were told that he was on the maximum dosage and couldn’t try anything else. ‘Harry was discharged four days before his death. He had more tightness in his chest and was becoming wheezy. Some . 1.1million children in the UK suffer from asthma and it is the . country’s most common long-term medical condition in youngsters. There are more than 1,100 deaths related to the condition every year. In 2009, 12 deaths occurred in children aged under 14. On average, three people every day die as a result of the condition. In 2008/9, the latest figures available, there were over 79,794 emergency hospital admissions for asthma in the UK in 2008-09. Of . these, 30,740 were children aged 14 years or under. A child is admitted . to hospital every 17 minutes as a result of the condition. Asthma affects the small tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. Anything that irritates sufferers’ airways causes the muscles around the walls of the airways tighten so they become narrower. This . sees the lining of the airways becomes inflamed and start to swell. Sticky mucus or phlegm can also builds up on occasions, which makes the . airways even more narrow. This can cause the airways to become irritated, making it harder to breathe. ‘We started to notice significant physical changes six months before his death. He gained a lot of weight and was growing quickly. ‘He had a constant heavy wheeze in the last months of his life. 'He was in an almost state of wheeziness and was laboured in breathing.’ Dr Dhia Mahmood, a consultant paediatrician who treated Harry between 2004 and 2008, saw him when he was admitted to casualty in October 2011. He said: ‘He was admitted with shortness of breath and wheezing, he was using his inhaler but it wasn’t responding. ‘He received two nebulisers and another dilator to improve the wheezing. 'He responded well and the decision was made to keep him in for two nights.’ He added: ‘Harry told me at the time that he had not been taking his inhaler regularly. I told him that it was important as a preventative treatment. ‘We were cautious in discharging him. We don’t discharge children and not see them again. 'He would have been seen by another doctor in one month.’ The hearing was told how Harry, from Croston in Lancashire, had been born six weeks premature and was diagnosed with asthma when he was just six months old. His family had quickly learnt to recognise when he was having a bad attack, and doctors had prescribed him medication including inhalers, antibiotics and steroids. His father said: ‘He was taken to A & E his entire life and had suffered life-threatening attacks maybe four or five times, where he would desperately gasp for breath.’ Their lawyer Leena Savjani said the inquest, which saw the coroner record a verdict of death by natural causes, had helped the family come forward with questions about their son’s medical treatment. She said: ‘The family were devastated by Harry’s death as they had helped to carefully manage his asthma for many years. ‘They have concerns about the events leading up to his death and need answers to come to terms with the tragic loss of their son.’ According to figures, 1.1million young people in the UK have asthma – the most common long-term illness in British children. There are currently more than 1,100 deaths related to the condition every year. The inquest continues.","Experienced first aider Dwayne Cuming, 39, attempted to revive Harry .

"Immigration minister Scott Morrison said the four brothers who slipped out of the country to join the fight with the Islamic State in the Middle East are now enemies of Australia. The western Sydney siblings - aged 17, 23, 25 and 28 made their way to Syria after they told their parents they won a trip to Thailand when they left the country in late October. But authorities tracked them down in Turkey after being alerted by concerned family members last Saturday when the men failed to contact home. It is thought that the four have since crossed the Syrian border to fight with IS militants. Scroll down for videos . More Australians have slipped through the cracks and fled overseas to join the fight with Islamic State . Family friend Dr Jamal Rifi has spoken on behalf of the family, saying: 'We are all not coping. These are Australian boys – we are losing them as they going where they’re not suppose to be [sic]'. Their mother has pleaded for the safe return of her four sons after she sent them off at Sydney Airport but when the boys arrived in Bangkok, they boarded a plane to Turkey, according to 9News. The family received a text message saying they were on their way to Syria. A message from their devastated mother – ‘My sons, you are dear to us. I can’t stop crying day and night. You are good at heart. You have done nothing wrong. Come back [sic],' Mr Rifi told 9News. It's reported that the family believes the boys had encountered with someone in Sydney and was given the money and contacts to be able to make the trip over. Scott Morrison said the four brothers will now face the consequences of their actions . Mr Morrison said they will now have to face the consequences of their actions. 'Once these young men cross over that line they become enemies of Australia and the world,' he told reporters in Sydney on Saturday. The brothers' family is reported to be devastated by the news. 'These four young men have effectively been indoctrinated by... a death cult,' the minister said. Mr Morrison said authorities had received the tip too late to apprehend them. The siblings were 'clean-skins' and had not been on any watch-lists. 'These were people for whom nothing indicated to date that they might be involved in this type of activity,' Mr Morrison said. He said it was important the community provided information to authorities. There are now more than 60 Australians known to be fighting in foreign conflicts. Mr Morrison said the four brothers who slipped out of the country to join ISIS are now enemies of Australia . Authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised . As authorities attempt to contain home-grown terrorists  from leaving the country, the latest recruits from Western Sydney have been labelled 'cleanskins' by police agencies because they were completely unknown to intelligence. Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee on Thursday that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were 'not on anyone's radar', the Guardian reported. 'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan, the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police. 1 . Authorities were alerted last Saturday when the family contacted a member of a local community after they failed to hear from their boys since they fled the country, the Daily Telegraph reports. Many foreign fighters have already left the country including Mohamed Elomar (pictured) Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed the family was seeking his help but unfortunately, it was too late. 'Australia has lost yet another four young kids. This is why we are so adamant in trying to prevent people leaving to join these foreign fighters', Mr Morrison told The Daily Telegraph. It follows after 'ginger' jihadist Abdullah Elmir disappeared from his Bankstown home in Sydney's south-west in June and made his way to the Middle East. The 17-year-old gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in the YouTube video. Khaled Sharrouf is also fighting with IS militants in the Middle East, and made headlines when he posted a photo of his young son brandishing a severed head . According to The Daily Telegraph, counter terrorism officers have been deployed to all Australian international airports. This comes just days ahead of the G20 summit to be held in Brisbane, which will be attended by a large number of world leaders. Police commissioner Neil Gaughan also told the committee he believed that federal police officers needed greater controls urgently, so they were better able to track the movements and interactions of suspects. 'But the fact is there’s still people travelling and regardless of what we’re doing, we’re not stopping that so we need some other tools,' he said, according to The Telegraph. Though he did not reveal from where or to what destination the group travelled, Gaughan said officers are now virtually powerless to stop them unless they resurface elsewhere. 'Unfortunately, once they get into Syria or into Iraq, there is nothing the AFP can do except wait for them to basically pop their head up somewhere on the way back.' Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan speaking at the investigation into new legislation in Canberra on Thursday . Gaughan was speaking at an investigation into new legislation which aims to give security agencies power to issue control orders on people who are enabling or supporting terrorism. He also revealed that authorities were struggling to keep up with the sheer number of people being radicalised in such a short time - often less than six months. Authorities said the ability to put restrictions on who suspects can communicate with and where they can go would allow them to greatly reduce the change of an attack on home soil.","Four brothers from Sydney's south-west left Australia, reports suggest .

"If you are feeling stressed, lonely or in pain, sometimes the only thing you crave is a cuddle. So an Indiana mother-of-two has started a business to take advantage of the desire for a comforting touch - by charging clients for cuddling sessions. Lisa Kelly from Carmel, Indiana, owns Indy Cuddles which offers 30 minutes worth of hugs for $35, $60 for an hour and $90 for 90 minutes. She will visit the customer's home and lie in many different, relaxing positions in what she believes is a form of therapy - but critics have said it is one step away from prostitution and an embarrassment to her family. Give me a hug: Lisa Kelly from Carmel, Indiana, owns Indy Cuddles which offers 30 minutes worth of hugs for $35, $60 for an hour and $90 for 90 minutes worth of hugs . Comfort: She will visit the client's home and lie in many different, relaxing positions in what she believes is a form of therapy - but critics have said it is one step away from prostitution . However she insists that the encounters are not sexual and come with certain rules, which includes avoiding the 'bathing suit' area and touching that would be 'acceptable with a child'. She told the Indianapolis Star: 'It's not sexual at all. It's something for people who feel alone or stressed out or in pain for whatever reason, lonely.' Kelly also ensures that both parties adopt cleanliness and adequate hygiene, including brushing teeth, showering and clean clothes. For safety, a third party is contacted before the meeting and told when the session is set to start and end while a waiver says she may carry a 'nonlethal weapon' on her person. She also meets the clients before their first encounter . A description on her website reads: 'Often times, our lives are too busy and our love lives are off timing, but that doesn't mean we should deprive ourselves our human contact and touch. Touch has an amazing healing effect, regardless the cause. 'Experiencing human touch brings us comfort in the form of physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It helps to assure us that everything IS going to be okay.' Despite the criticism, research has proved that cuddles have a number of health benefits. Hugs prompt the body to produce ample amounts of the hormone oxytocin, which is released in response to physical touch and repairs muscle. Oxytocin is associated with maternal nurturing, social attachments, childbirth and sex is essential for healthy muscle maintenance and repair. Boundaries: She insists that the encounters are not sexual and come with certain rules, which include no touching in the 'bathing suit' area . Precautions: For safety, a third party is contacted before the meeting and told when the session is set to start and end while a waiver says she may carry a 'nonlethal weapon' on her person . Research has found that unlike other treatments for muscle wasting, the hormone does not cause cancer and when injected, it could help old people recover from muscle injuries faster. Scientists from Emory University also found in 1999 that gentle touching reduces the physical signs of stress and tension. Depauw University's Touch and Emotion Lab has found that touching skin helps people develop closer bonds, particularly in infants . In 2012, Jackie Samuel established The Snuggery in Rochester, New York. She turned to getting paid. She reportedly made $260 a day and cuddles with up to 30 men a week - including pensioners and war veterans. However at the time her college threatened to expel her and some called her a prostitute. In September, an app called Cuddlr was launched. Using the same system as the likes of Tinder and Grindr, it is a location-based meeting service that connects and matches people who want to hug strangers .

"As landings go, this will be one of the trickiest ever attempted. On August 6 Nasa’s Curiosity rover, packed inside the Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft, will hurtle towards the Martian surface at around 13,200mph – and has just over six minutes to slow down and make a soft landing. What’s more, the craft has to be at just the right angle for the descent to be a success – likened by one Nasa scientist to firing a golf ball from Los Angeles to land in a hole at St Andrew’s in Scotland. The mission's entry, descent, and landing (EDL) phase begins when the spacecraft reaches the top of Martian atmosphere, about 81 miles (131 kilometres) above the surface of the Gale crater landing area, and ends with the rover safe and sound on the surface of Mars. Gently does it: Curiosity will be lowered down by a Sky Crane craft fitted with retro boosters . Speedy: The Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft, with Curiosity inside, will hit the Martian atmosphere at 13,200mph . Red alert: Curiosity will probe the Martian environment using highly advanced instruments . During the EDL, the three-ton spacecraft decelerates from a velocity of . about 13,200 miles per hour (5,900 metres per second) at the top of the . atmosphere, to stationary on the surface. Most of the enormous deceleration . needed will be achieved by friction with the atmosphere. In the final . stages a parachute will be deployed and the Curiosity rover will pop out . of the main craft attached by nylon tethers to a Sky Crane fitted with . retro rockets. This craft will hover above the surface and gently lower Curiosity down. How Curiosity will make its nervy landing on the Martian surface . Size matters: The Mars Science Laboratory is the biggest and most sophisticated planet-roaming machine ever to be deployed . It’s a set of manoeuvres that’ll leave staff at mission control with sweaty palms. Dr Charles Elachi, director of Nasa's . Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, where the probe was . built, told The Independent: ‘We will be very nervous. Landing on . another planet is not a walk in the park. It's very challenging and . there have been mixed successes and failures in the past.’ In 2003, for instance, Britain’s Beagle 2 probe lost contact with Earth as it came into land and was never heard from again. Elachi added: ‘The reason we are . nervous is that it's about 3 tonnes of mass… equivalent in terms of . energy to 25 high-speed trains going at full speed. In addition, the . accuracy we have to point to be at the right angle is equivalent to me . being in Los Angeles and hitting a golf ball to land in a hole on St . Andrew's golf course in Scotland.’ About to have a blast: The Mars Science Laboratory, with Curiosity inside, being transported to the launch pad . Up, up and away: The rocket carrying curiosity took off successfully on November 26 last year . Nasa’s most advanced mobile robotic laboratory will examine one of the most intriguing areas on Mars. Curiosity is a rover with more scientific capability than any ever sent to another planet. It . will set down inside a huge crater and use its highly advanced . instruments, including cameras and lasers, to find out more about the . planet’s environment, which will help pave the way for human missions. Doug McCuistion, director of the Mars . Exploration Program at Nasa Headquarters in Washington, said: ‘Mars . Science Laboratory builds upon the improved understanding about Mars . gained from current and recent missions. ‘This mission . advances technologies and science that will move us toward missions to . return samples from, and eventually send humans to, Mars.’ The one-ton rover will examine Gale Crater during a mission that will last nearly two years. Curiosity will land near the base of a layered mountain three miles (five kilometres) high inside the crater. The rover will investigate whether environmental conditions have ever been favourable for development of microbial life and preserved evidence of those conditions. John Grotzinger, project scientist for the Mars Science Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said: ‘Gale gives us a superb opportunity to test multiple potentially habitable environments and the context to understand a very long record of early environmental evolution of the planet. ‘The portion of the crater where Curiosity will land has an alluvial fan likely formed by water-carried sediments. Layers at the base of the mountain contain clays and sulphates, both known to form in water.’ Curiosity is twice as long and five times as heavy as earlier Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. The rover will carry a set of 10 science instruments weighing 15 times as much as its predecessors' science payloads. A mast extending to seven feet (2.1 metres) above ground provides height for cameras and a laser-firing instrument to study targets from a distance. Instruments on a seven-foot-long (2.1-metre-long) arm will study targets up close. Analytical instruments inside the rover will determine the composition of rock and soil samples acquired with the arm's powdering drill and scoop. Other instruments will characterise the environment, including the weather and natural radiation that will affect future human missions.","The robotic lab is due to land on Mars on August 6 .
Rock, soil, weather and environment will all be studied by the Curiosity rover ."
"Mourners clapped and cheered during Rik Mayall's funeral today after his friend and long-term collaborator Adrian Edmondson looked close to tears as he helped carry his rose-covered wicker coffin.

"Mark Berndt, 62, a former teacher, has agreed to plead no contest to all charges after her was found feeding cookies laced with his semen to pupils . A former Los Angeles elementary school teacher charged with blindfolding students and spoon-feeding them cookies laced with his semen has agreed to plead no contest to all charges, an attorney for some of the victims said Thursday. Mark Berndt plans to enter the legal equivalent of guilty pleas to 23 charges at a hearing Friday, according to John Manly, an attorney who represents 30 Miramonte Elementary School students and their parents. Manly said he was notified of the plea by prosecutors. The plea agreement calls for Berndt to be sentenced to 25 years in prison. Manly called the agreement a victory for his clients and said they are grateful for being treated 'with decency and dignity' by prosecutors. 'He's going to jail essentially for the rest of his life,' he said of the 62-year-old Berndt. 'You can't ask for more than that.' He said prosecutors urged a plea deal because 'they were concerned about re-traumatizing the children at trial.' The district attorney's office and Berndt's lawyer declined to comment. Before Berndt was sentenced, a parade of sobbing mothers denounced him, saying he had ruined their lives and the lives of their daughters. The women were not named in court. They said they could not understand how the school district did not know about the incidents. Some said their daughters could no longer eat cookies or anything sweet unless they knew their mothers had baked the items for them. They spoke of girls who had now become unable to socialize and locked themselves in their bedrooms. Day in court: Disgraced former Los Angeles teacher Mark Berndt, 62, pleads no contest during his change-of-plea hearing Friday . Bleak future: The plea agreement calls for the former Miramonte Elementary School teacher to be sentenced to 25 years in prison . Even though defense attorney Manny . Medrano said his client was remorseful and apologetic, the 62-year-old . man in an orange prison jumpsuit showed no emtional and stared straight . ahead during the impact statements. Berndt . taught at the south Los Angeles school for more than 30 years. The . allegations against him came to light when a drugstore photo technician . noticed dozens of odd photos of blindfolded third-graders and reported . them to authorities. Investigators said they discovered a plastic spoon in Berndt's classroom trash bin. Tests found traces of semen on it. According to prosecutors, Berndt used the semen-coated cookies for ""tasting games"" with students. He was removed from the classroom in January 2011. Berndt was fired and the Los Angeles Unified School District then paid him $40,000 to drop his appeal, which officials said was the most immediate way to ensure he wouldn't be a threat to other children. The move still brought heavy criticism. Dozens of lawsuits and claims were filed on behalf of victims. Sean Rossall, a district spokesman, said 63 cases have been settled for a total of $29.5million, and 71 are pending. Stone-faced: Even though defense attorney Manny Medrano (left) said his client was remorseful and apologetic, the 62-year-old man showed no emtional and stared straight ahead during impact statements . He said the district has not seen the plea agreement and won't comment until it's approved by a judge. 'We're focused on the civil cases and . settling them in a manner that is respectful of the health and . educational needs of students and their families,' he said. The . Miramonte case led to a wide-ranging overhaul of how the nation's . second-largest school district handles allegations of sexual abuse after . it was revealed that previous complaints about Berndt's behavior were . ignored. It also showed . how slowly state officials act to censure teachers and led to a flurry . of allegations of teacher-student sex abuse in the district and in other . school systems. Shortly . after Berndt's arrest, the school district temporarily removed all 76 . of the school's teachers, along with staff and administrators, putting . them on leave and having them report to an empty high school nearby. Six . months later, when the new school year began, 43 of them returned to a . restructured Miramonte with a new principal. The rest either retired or . went to new schools. None was accused of any wrongdoing. The man worked at Miramonte Elementary School in south Los Angeles (pictured) for more than 30 years but was removed from duty in 2011 after the 'tasting game' came to light . Manly denounced the district for allowing Berndt to continue teaching after there had been complaints about him in the 1990s. 'For all intents and purposes , this man murdered these children emotionally,' he said, noting all of the children are in therapy. He said some have developed severe eating disorders as a result of the abuse with cookies. Another Miramonte teacher, Martin Springer, is charged with lewd acts on a child in a case involving a second-grader that authorities said was fondled in class in 2009. Springer is awaiting trial.","Mark Berndt, 62, a former Los Angeles teacher, has pleaded no contest .

"Vast freshwater reserves have been discovered under the ocean floor which scientists believe could sustain future generations. Australian researchers claim to have found 500,000 cubic kilometres (120,000 cubic miles) of freshwater buried beneath the seabed on continental shelves off Australia, China, North America and South Africa. The discovery comes as United Nations estimates suggest water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of the population of the world over the last century. Australian researchers have discovered vast freshwater reserves beneath the seabed on continental shelves . Lead author Vincent Post, from Flinders University, said: ‘The volume of this water resource is a hundred times greater than the amount we've extracted from the Earth's sub-surface in the past century since 1900. ‘Freshwater on our planet is increasingly under stress and strain so the discovery of significant new stores off the coast is very exciting. ‘It means that more options can be considered to help reduce the impact of droughts and continental water shortages.’ According to UN Water estimates, water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of population in the last century due to demands such as irrigated agriculture and meat production. More than 40 per cent of the world's population already live in conditions of water scarcity. By 2030, UN Water estimates that 47 per cent of people will exist under high water stress. Scientists hope the discovery will help reduce the impact of droughts and continental water shortages . Mr Post said his team's . findings were drawn from a review of seafloor water studies done for . scientific or oil and gas exploration purposes. ‘By . combining all this information we've demonstrated that the freshwater . below the seafloor is a common finding, and not some anomaly that only . occurs under very special circumstances,’ he said. The . deposits were formed over hundreds of thousands of years in the past, . when the sea level was much lower and areas now under the ocean were . exposed to rainfall which was absorbed into the underlying water table. When . the polar icecaps started melting about 20,000 years ago these . coastlines disappeared under water, but their aquifers remain intact - . protected by layers of clay and sediment. Post said the deposits were comparable with the bore basins currently relied upon by much of the world for drinking water and would cost much less than seawater to desalinate. Drilling for the water would be expensive, and Post said great care would have to be taken not to contaminate the aquifers. He warned that they were a precious resource. ‘We should use them carefully: once gone, they won't be replenished until the sea level drops again, which is not likely to happen for a very long time,’ Mr Post said.","Researchers make discovery on continental shelves off Australia, China, North America and South Africa .

"A French blogger has been fined £1,200 after a judge ruled a negative restaurant review appeared too high on Google searches. Caroline Doudet was also ordered to amend the title of her review, written in August 2013, which described the restaurant as 'the place to avoid in Cap-Ferret.' Owners of the Il Giardino restaurant, in the Aquitaine region of southwestern France, sued Ms Doudet claiming the review, which appeared fourth in Google searches, was hurting their business. A French blogger has been fined £1,200 after writing a negative review of the Il Giardino restaurant, in the Aquitaine region of southwestern France . A judge in Bordeaux this month ordered the review's title be altered and told Ms Doudet to pay the restaurant €1,500 in damages, along with €1,000 to cover the compainant's costs. Ms Doudet told the BBC: 'This decision creates a new crime of ""being too highly ranked [on a search engine]"", or of having too great an influence. 'What is perverse, is that we look for bloggers who are influential, but only if they are nice about people.' Ms Doudet's blog, Cultur'elle, has about 3,000 followers, which the judge said had exacerbated the damage caused to the restaurant. The restaurant owner told French website Arrêt sur Images, as cited by the BBC: 'Maybe there were some errors in the service, that happens sometimes in the middle of August - I recognise that. 'But this article showed in the Google search results and did my business more and more harm, even though we have worked seven days a week for 15 years. I could not accept that.' Ms Doudet's blog, Cultur'elle has about 3,000 followers, which the judge said had exacerbated the damage caused to the restaurant . While the decision is believed to be the first time an unpaid blogger has been ordered to pay damages following a negative review, the case is not thought to have created legal precedence in France because it was an emergency measure. Under French law, such emergency measures can be carried out if a defendant is found to be causing harm to another party. Ms Doudet has decided to delete the review, rather than change the title, because it was 'easier', Wired.co.uk has reported. Earlier this month it was reported South Tyneside Council had spent £200,000 on a hunt for a notorious internet blogger known as Mr Monkey after he insulted local councillors. The anonymous writer referred to councillors as ‘Pudgy Face’, ‘Miss Piggy’, ‘King of Sleaze’ and ‘The Fat Mackem Hobbit’ as he promised to ‘expose the truth’ behind their alleged lies. Despite the internet troll abandoning the blog in 2009, the north east council have only just called off the manhunt - having spent the last five years searching for him. The council launched the search after insisting they had a ‘duty of care’ to protect their employees from malicious accusations made online.","French blogger Caroline Doudet was ordered to pay damages to restaurant .

"Facebook is embroiled in a new privacy row after it began selling access to users in order to bolster its profits. The social networking site is allowing companies to trawl through its 900m users looking for email addresses and phone numbers so it can better target adverts. The changes mean that if you hand over any details when you buy something - as many consumers do - that company can now track you down on Facebook. Privacy row: The social networking site is allowing companies to trawl through its 900m users looking for email addresses and phone numbers so it can better target adverts . The measures appear to be a cynical . attempt to sidestep restrictions imposed on Facebook by US regulators . due to earlier botched privacy changes. They . have already sparked calls for an official investigation by campaigners . who claim that the public have not been properly notified. The . new measures, which have been in effect for weeks, will affect . consumers who have handed over personal data when they buy something, . which is the majority of people given the rise of Internet shopping . Retailers will then be allowed to compare their own databases with the information on Facebook. Not private: The changes mean that if you hand over any details when you buy something - as many consumers do - that company can now track you down on Facebook . For example, an airline will now be able to target adverts at a consumer who had recently taken a flight to Barcelona. A mobile phone company could also advertise upgrades to somebody who was nearing the end of their contract. Another disturbing element is that the adverts could appear on a user’s computer even when they are not on Facebook. The social networking site is also increasing its monitoring and will work with US-based company Datalogix to see what consumers are buying. Facebook claimed that there are safeguards attached to the new measures. Dear leader: The social networking site, founded by Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) is also increasing its monitoring and will work with US-based company Datalogix to see what consumers are buying . Phone numbers and email addresses will be replaced by hash symbols so nobody actually knows who the person is, even if they can track their behaviour. Users will also have to give permission but campaigners in the US have said that changing the settings is ‘confusing and ineffective’. The Electronic Privacy Information Centre and the Centre for Digital Democracy have already asked watchdog the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the arrangement. In a joint letter they said: ‘Facebook did not attempt to notify users of its decision to disclose user information . ‘Neither Facebook’s Data Use Policy nor its Statement of Rights and Responsibilities adequately explains the specific types of information Facebook discloses, the manner in which the disclosure occurs, or the identities of the third parties receiving the information.’ Facebook is under pressure to improve on the £1.1bn it makes each year from advertising after its disastrous stock market floatation which saw its shares fall by more than half their value. Last year it was forced to overhaul its privacy policy after the FTC ruled it had been lying to its users for the past four years. The serious violations included allowing other companies access to users’ personal information - even after they deleted their accounts. Under the tough agreement - which applies Britain - Facebook agreed to independent periodic monitoring for the next 20 years to stop it from re-offending. It also vowed to obtain users ‘express consent’ before making privacy changes. Facebook privacy engineer Joey Tyson said: ‘As we pursue our goal of making the world more open and connected, we have designed our service to show ads that help people discover products that are interesting to them. ‘We also recognise that our users trust us to protect the information they share on Facebook. ‘Maintaining that trust is a top priority as we continue to grow.’","The changes mean that companies can track you down on Facebook every time you buy something .

"France's transport chief says faulty maintenance on a signal and hot weather may have played a role in the collision of two trains in southwest France yesterday, which left 25 injured. The horrific crash between a high-speed . TGV and a TER regional commuter train took place close to the town of . Denguin, 12 miles from Pau, on the northern edge of the Pyrenees. A seven-month-old baby and a ten-year-old child are among the victims. Frederic Cuvillier said on Europe-1 . radio Friday that 'maintenance on the signals appears to have been . disrupted and faulty.' He noted that heat can also cause signal . problems. Aftermath: The crumpled engine section of the high speed TGV passenger train, right, sits on the track in front of the  commuter train it collided with in southern France . Cuvillier would not say whether the accident was due to human error or technical problems. France, . whose extensive train network is widely used by tourists in summer, is . upgrading railways nationwide as part of larger reforms of the industry. The TGV was carrying 178 passengers from Paris to Tarbes, a line extremely popular with British tourists and expats. The . TER had 70 on board, and looked to have suffered the worst of the . damage. Many passengers were so badly hurt they had to be airlifted to . hospital. One . witness said: ‘The TGV slowed down and then it picked up speed. It was . hit from behind by a TER on the same line.’ The line was shut and by 8pm . dozens of fire fighters and emergency workers were at the scene. The accident comes a year after the Bretigny-sur-Orge rail crash near Paris, in which seven people died. France's transport chief says faulty maintenance on a signal and hot weather may have played a role in the collision of two trains in southwest France yesterday, which left 25 injured . Railway employees and investigators survey the damaged commuter train after it crashed into a TGV high speed passenger service . The line is extremely popular with British holidaymakers and expats who have homes in the Pyrenees area. One . passenger on board told local French media: ‘The TGV slowed down and . then it picked up speed. It was hit from behind by a TER which was on . the same line.’ The injured were believed to be aboard the commuter train, and included a 10-month-old baby who was airlifted to hospital. The line was completely shut down and, by 8pm, dozens of firefighters and other emergency workers were at the scene. It comes a year after the Bretigny rail crash, near Paris, in which seven people died and dozens more were injured. The collision was between a regional commuter train and a TGV high speed train, similar to the one pictured (file picture) The crash happened close to the town of Denguin, 12 miles from Pau, on the nothern edge of the Pyrenees in south west France . The . 2013 crash highlighted the decaying state of France's rail network, . with an official report blaming underinvestment and poor maintenance for . the disaster. In . a report handed over to judges, inspectors said the Bretigny derailment . was caused by a faulty fishplate - a bar that links two pieces of rail . together. Inspections in the area of the crash near the station of Bretigny-sur-Orge, south of Paris, also identified 100 defects. These included joints that were loose or missing. Faults had been known for up to about eight months prior to the accident but nothing was done about them. Prosecutor Eric Lallement said the main cause of the accident was a ‘shortfall in the quality of maintenance’. Hundreds of thousands of British people use the French railway network every year, with the high speed Eurostar link between Paris and London making connections extremely straightforward.","Collision was between a high-speed TGV and a regional commuter train .

"A group of intrepid archaeologists are excavating a 5,000 year old ancient site on the Turkish-Syrian border within sight of the black flag of ISIS. The Italian researchers are digging in the ancient city of Karkemish, which is close to the Syrian city of Jarablous - which is under the control of the feared terrorist organisation. Archaeology Professor Nicolo Marchetti, of the University of Bologna said his team has been working as US and coalition aircraft screamed overhead on their way to targeting the Islamic extremists. Prof Nicolo Marchetti said the site of Karemish is just 20 metres from ISIS controlled territory in Syria . His team have been working within sight of the black flag of ISIS which flies over the Syrian side of the border . Prof Marchetti said he hoped the area could be opened up for tourists by next spring - despite the neighbours . Turkish troops allowed the researchers back onto the site in 2011 for the first time in more than 90 years. He said: 'Basically we work 20 meters away from the Islamic State-controlled areas.' Due to the sensitive nature of the location, the area is guarded by more than 500 Turkish soldiers, tanks and it is covered by artillery. He said: 'Still, we have had no problem at all. ... We work in a military area. It is very well protected.' The project, which also includes archaeologists from Gaziantep and Istanbul universities, is doing the most extensive excavations at Karkemish in nearly a century, building on the work of British Museum teams that included T.E. Lawrence, the adventurer known as Lawrence of Arabia. Marchetti said the plan is to open the site to tourists next spring. A concrete barrier, about four meters high, will be installed at the site. He said: 'This will be a total protection for the tourists.' The strategic city, its importance long known to scholars because of references in ancient texts, was under the sway of Hittites and other imperial rulers and independent kings. Turkish authorities allowed researchers access the site in 2011 for the first time in more than 90 years . Almost a century ago, Lawrence of Arabia spent time excavating the historically important site in Turkey . Unfortunately, tourists won't be able to access approximately one-third of the site as it is across the border . However, archaeological investigation there was halted by World War I. It was stopped again by hostilities between Turkish nationalists and French colonizers from Syria who built machine gun nests in its defensive walls. Part of the area was mined in the 1950s, and in later years, creating deadly obstacles to excavation. Demining was completed just a few years ago. Archaeologists are completing their fourth season unearthing the secrets of Karkemish along the Euphrates. The archaeological site is just a few yards from the Syrian border which is under the control of ISIS . The area is being guarded by more than 500 Turkish troops, tanks and artillery to prevent ISIS incursions . Before the archaeologists could begin their work, the entire area had to be de-mined . The name Karkemish means 'Quay of (the god) Kamis,' a deity at the time in northern Syria. Stone monuments decorated with sculptures, hieroglyphics and more than 20 meter-high city walls attest to the influence of the town. Among this year's finds were sculptures in the palace of King Katuwa, who ruled the area around 900 B.C. There were five large orthostats in limestone and basalt, a dark grey to black rock, that portray row of individuals bearing gifts of gazelle. An orthostate is an upright stone or slab that forms part of a structure. The archaeologists also found a mosaic floor in the palace of Sargon II, who reigned around 700 B.C. over Assyria, an ancient empire mostly located in Mesopotamia. And the team finished exploration of the ruins of the expedition house of Lawrence of Arabia, who worked at Karkemish between 1911 and 1914. The team began its project in 2011 around the time that the Syrian uprising against President Bashar Assad was escalating. About one-third of the 90-hectare (222-acre) archaeological site lies inside Syria and is therefore off-limits; construction and farming in Jarablous have encroached on what was the outer edge of the ancient city. Most discoveries have been made on the Turkish side. Among the artifacts uncovered at the site is this Roman statue which now at the entrance of a museum . Despite the danger posed by the ISIS fanatics just a few metres away, archaeologists continued their work . Among the artifacts recovered from the site is this bath and a pair of ancient jugs . Intriguingly, the artifacts recovered represent a number of different civilisations who all spent time in the area . The area around the ancient city had been off-limits to archaeologists for more than 90 years . Archaeologists had to wait for a mine field to be cleared before they could access the site and begin work . Unfortunately, a quarter of the ancient city is off-limits as it is on the wrong side of the border .","Reseachers have uncovered ancient monuments just 20 metres from ISIS .

"A man condemned as the nation’s most feckless father has boasted about how he dodged jail after beating up his ex-girlfriend and their young daughter in a row over sunglasses. Keith MacDonald, 28, who is said to have 11 children with ten different mothers, was spared a prison sentence yesterday for assaulting Clare Bryant and Paige, three. The court heard how MacDonald kicked and punched 24-year-old Miss Bryant and hit their daughter’s head with a fridge door. See video below... Doing a runner: Father-of-11 Keith Macdonald tries to dodge the photographers by running out of Sunderland Magistrates Court after he avoided jail for attacking his former partner . Get away: Unemployed Macdonald dodged jail and is seen here trying to do a runner in a pair of Nike Air trainers . Tribute: Macdonald, who was sentenced for attacking his former lover Clare Bryant, has her name tattooed on his arm . But magistrates took pity on the . unemployed drifter after hearing that he ‘wanted to change his life . around’ and ‘needed their help’. Outside court however, he was . unrepentant,  boasting that he was innocent and had lied to avoid jail. ‘I pleaded guilty to get out of jail,’ he said. ‘If I plead guilty, I . won’t go. I didn’t do it – I didn’t touch her. ‘I’m happy about not going to jail. It gives me a chance to get my life back on track.’ MacDonald says he has slept with more . than 40 women and first became a father when he was just 15. Miss . Bryant was the eighth woman he made pregnant after he met her while . drunk at a bus stop. Yesterday, magistrates in  Sunderland heard how he . beat up the 24-year-old when he went to her home in Houghton-le-Spring . in June this year. Paul Doney, prosecuting, described . how MacDonald came round to drop off some money while the victim was . with her daughters, Paige and Chloe, aged two. ‘She asked him to go away, then he asked for his sunglasses and was asked to stay where he was while she got them,’ he said. ‘He tried to push past her, then . grabbed her hair and pulled her down before kicking her in the face and . punching her to the head. He was pushed back towards the yard as a . neighbour shouted at them.’ MacDonald, of Sunderland, then threw . the fridge door open, hitting Paige on the back of the head. The child . suffered a sore head while her mother sustained a graze and a cut lip. MacDonald’s lawyer, Gavin Sword, told . the court that his client wanted to change his life around. ‘He doesn’t . enjoy getting himself in these situations and being punished,’ said Mr . Sword.

He was jailed last year after attacking her . ‘He appears willing to engage in work and is addressing his abusive behaviour in relationships.’ MacDonald pleaded guilty to assault by beating and assault at a previous . hearing and was yesterday sentenced to 20 weeks in jail, suspended for . two years. He has other convictions for violent . crimes and was ordered to attend a ‘building better relationships . programme’ plus carry out unpaid work. He is banned from seeing Miss . Bryant and her daughter except through arrangement by a solicitor and . will have to pay her £100 compensation. Peter Devere, the presiding magistrate, said there were was ‘no mitigation’ for the offence but added: ‘We feel you need help.’ However, the sentencing left Miss . Bryant furious. ‘It just makes me angry,’ she said. ‘I’m more worried . for my kids than for me – no one knows what he’s capable of.’ She said the court’s decision to . place MacDonald on a building relationships programme was ‘ridiculous’. ‘He has had the opportunity to get help for years and he’s turned it . down year after year after year,’ she said. MacDonald said afterwards he had . decided not to have any more children and claimed that the true number . was eight – not 11. ‘That’s enough,’ he said. ‘I don’t want the hassle . of having more.’ Asked how much he pays in child maintenance, he added: ‘I don’t know, it just comes out of my benefits before they arrive.’ MacDonald claims he will soon start a . job leafleting but currently lives on £44 a week income support and is . said to pay just £5 a week towards the upkeep of his children. He and Miss Bryant became engaged . soon after they met but split long before Paige was born in April 2010.

"A New Jersey man had his left leg amputated after a drunk driver struck him and dragged him over a mile with his body protruding through the windshield, officials said. Kenneth C Moeller, 61, of Lanoka Harbor was on life support at Jersey Shore University Medical Center after the operation, following a grisly car crash in Ocean Township on Monday evening. NJ.com reports that Marcos Ortega, 33, was allegedly under the influence as he traveled north on Route 9 in a 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse. Accused: Marcos Ortega, 33, was arrested after allegedly striking Kenneth C Moeller, 61, in a drunk driving accident and refusing to stop as Moeller lay on the hood of his car . He veered onto the shoulder of the highway, where he struck Moeller as he was walking, according to investigators. The crash resulted in Moeller becoming stuck in the windshield of Ortega's car, which the driver continued to operate for a mile and a half. It was only when Ocean Township Patrolman Kyle Flatt arrived, in response to a report of a car driving erratically, that Ortega stopped the car, authorities said. The Waretown Volunteer Fire Department and First-Aid were called and assisted police personnel with extricating Moeller. The victim was flown to the hospital with serious injuries. He was listed as being in critical condition before his surgery. Critical: The Ocean County Prosecutor's office said that Moeller required an amputation of his left leg after being taken to Jersey Shore University Medical Center in critical condition . The Ocean County Prosecutor's Office said police conducted sobriety tests on Ortega, and found the driver was under the influence. Ortega was charged with leaving the scene of a motor vehicle crash and causing serious bodily injury to another while driving under the influence, with bail set at $150,000.","Kenneth C Moeller was on life support at Jersey Shore University Medical Center after the operation .

"England is the only developed country producing school leavers who are worse at maths and reading than their grandparents, according to a damning report. The study found 16 to 24-year-olds are among the least literate and numerate in the world, lagging behind those in countries including Estonia, Poland and the Slovak Republic. England came 22nd out of 24 countries for the reading skills of its young people and 21st for maths, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Damning report: An international study has found that the UK's young people are 'among the least literate and numerate in the developed world' (file picture) The figures showed many Japanese school leavers are more advanced than English university graduates. The OECD said England was the only country where the oldest age group  studied (55-65) had a higher proficiency in  literacy and numeracy than the youngest (16-24) after other factors such as sex, socio-economic background and type of occupation were taken into account. The organisation warned England would struggle with competitors in global markets unless urgent action was taken. The Tories said the report exposed the failings of Labour during its 13 years in power. ‘These are Labour’s children, educated under a Labour government and force-fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations,’ said skills and enterprise minister Matthew Hancock. Labour came to power in 1997 after Tony Blair pledged his priority would be ‘education, education, education’. England was the only country in developed world in which those aged 55-65 performed better than 16-24-year-olds . Today's . findings show that the billions poured into education by Labour failed . to push up standards of literacy and numeracy, critics have said. The . Government has claimed that the OECD's research underlines who . 'Labour's children, educated under a Labour government and force-fed a . diet of dumbing down and low expectations.' Official . figures from the Office for National Statistics have shown that . Labour’s spending on education rose from £35.3billion in 2000 to . £63.9billion in 2009. Yet it appears large numbers left school with no improvements in standards when compared to previous generations. Last year a different report found despite Tony Blair declaring his priorities as ‘education, education, . education’ when he swept to power in 1997, a huge increase in spending . on schools led to ‘no improvement in student learning outcomes’. The OECD study – Education at a Glance – found that expenditure on . UK primary and secondary schools and colleges as a percentage of GDP . increased from 3.6 per cent in 1995 to 4.5 per cent in 2009, higher than . the OECD average of four per cent. At the same time, there has been ‘no improvement in student learning outcomes’, the report said . Spending in the sector soared by 78 . per cent from £50billion to £89billion by the time the party lost the . election in 2010. During this period, GCSE and A-level grades rose every . year, which critics claimed was evidence of dumbing down. Andreas . Schleicher, of the OECD, said young adults had more qualifications than . those nearing retirement, but not greater abilities. This indicated that there had been grade inflation and that qualifications did not necessarily mean better skills. The finding ‘doesn’t look good for the UK’, Mr Schleicher said. The 466-page study was the first carried out by the OECD into the work skills of 16  to 65-year-olds, establishing their abilities in literacy, numeracy and problem solving. A total of 166,000 were interviewed in 24 countries, including 9,000 in England and Northern Ireland. Scotland and Wales were not covered. The study found a quarter of adults in England (8.5million) have the maths skills of a ten-year-old, with a large minority only able to perform sums with whole numbers. Literacy levels are also below average, with 16.4 per cent of adults (5.8million) reading at the level of a child in the penultimate year of primary school. Just 42.4 per cent of young adults were proficient in problem solving. This was around 8 percentage points less than the average of 50.7 per cent, and 21 behind the best-performing country, South Korea. Not moving forward: This chart from the report shows how Britain's young people and older people are roughly at the same level, whereas countries like Korea are showing huge improvement between generations . Picture of Britain: This graph shows how the UK compared to other industrial nations when it came to numeracy . Interesting: Countries like Japan, Netherlands and Sweden were the top performing in terms of literacy, even though children start school often years later than British youngsters . England produced 8 per cent of the world’s most highly skilled workers in the late 1960s and 70s. This has dropped to 4 per cent and the trend is expected to continue. The report said the ‘talent pool of highly skilled adults in England... is likely to shrink relative to that of other countries’ in the next few decades. The slide could be reversed only if ‘significant action is taken to improve skills proficiency among young people’. England also lags behind other nations in the proportion of people continuing with education into adulthood. One positive note was that the country has been successful in making good use of its pool of skilled talent, resulting in high productivity and wages. The Coalition has taken steps to improve education, demanding an end to grade inflation and making courses and exams tougher. The number of top GCSE and A-level grades has now decreased for the past two years. John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘The OECD report highlights what our members tell us – that young people don’t have the literacy and numeracy skills to do the job properly. We need action to improve these crucial basic skills from an early age.’ The shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, defended Labour’s record, saying it ‘drove up standards in maths and English across our schools, evident in the huge improvements we saw in GCSE results between 1997 and 2010’. Failed? The Government said today this generation of young people are 'Labour's children' 'force-fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations' Mike Harris, of the Institute of Directors, said the report ‘underlines the credibility gap between the picture painted by decades of rises in exam pass rates and employers’ real-world experience of interviewing and employing people’. Former Labour education and employment secretary David Blunkett questioned the OECD’s methodology and said the report ‘warranted united action, not party political point scoring’. Education has undergone massive change since Labour began replacing grammar schools with the comprehensive system in 1965. In 1988 GCSEs replaced O-levels and the National Curriculum was introduced, and in 1997 Labour abolished the Assisted Places Scheme awarding free places at fee-paying schools to gifted children from low or middle-income families. The academy schools programme began in 2000, with schools funded by the state and made independent of local government control. In 2010 the Coalition launched free schools, which are similar to academies  but can be set up by groups including parents, teachers, charities. Participants in the skills survey were asked to answer a series of questions testing their numeracy, literacy and problem solving. Here are some examples: . NUMERACY .

"Russia has denied reports that Vladimir Putin is to leave the G20 summit early after a strained 50 minute meeting with David Cameron. It was rumoured that the Russian President had decided to head home ahead of schedule following stern words from Mr Cameron during crunch talks  over Ukraine. But a spokesman for the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, took to Russian radio today to deny that the leader was cutting his trip short - insisting he will only leave when the summit is complete. Scroll down for video . Vladimir Putin is set to leave the G20 summit early after a strained 50 minute meeting with David Cameron . 'The G20 summit will be over tomorrow (Sunday),' Mr Peskov said. 'Putin will certainly leave it, when all the work is completed the president will leave.' During the robust exchange between Mr Putin and David Cameron, the British Prime Minister was said to have warned him that the Russian's relationship with the west was at a 'crossroads. The tense meeting at the summit in Australia, came after the Prime Minister compared Russia to Nazi Germany, saying that they were 'unacceptable'. A source in the Russian delegation had earlier said: 'The programme of the second day (Sunday) is changing, it's being cut short.' . It was suggested that Mr Putin would attend summit sessions on Sunday but would skip an official lunch and address reporters earlier than planned. The Telegraph reported that  Mr Cameron told Mr Putin that he was at a 'crossroads' and was risking the nation's relationship with other Western countries. 'I take people as I find them. The sad thing is that to date undertakings given in the Minsk agreement have not been followed but the right thing to do is to continue to engage,' said Mr Cameron. During crunch talks Cameron warned Putin that he was at a 'crossroad's with the west . 'So far we haven't seen his actions follow up the statements that he's given on previous occasions.' 'The point is and the reason for meeting is that this issue matters and it's very important Russia understands what's at stake and gets a very clear message,' he said. 'There's a real choice here, there's a different and better way for Russia to behave that could lead to an easing of relations, but at the moment he's not taking that path.' Before his  meeting with Putin The Prime Minister said Russia faced a choice, with one option to implement an agreement to allow stability to return to Ukraine free of Moscow's meddling. 'It's important to warn of the dangers if Russia continues to head in the other direction,' Mr Cameron said. 'If that path continues and if that destabilisation gets worse, the rest of the world, Europe, America, Britain, will have no choice but to take further action in terms of sanctions,' he said. Western leaders have levelled criticism against the Russian hardman, with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott famously announcing last month he would 'shirtfront' Mr Putin over Russia's support for separatists who allegedly shot down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, resulting in the deaths of 298 people including 38 Australian citizens and residents. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper reportedly told Mr Putin at the Summit, 'I guess I'll shake your hand, but I'll only have one thing to say to you - get out of the Ukraine.' There was no immediate comment from the G20's Australian hosts or other delegations.. G20 host Tony Abbott went into a week of Asia-Pacific summitry vowing to confront Putin, particularly over the downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over Ukraine in July. In the event, on Saturday, the Australian prime minister was all smiles as he posed for a handshake with a similarly grinning Putin - before the two leaders were photographed holding koala bears together. However, the koala diplomacy was followed by less cuddly formal talks on the G20 sidelines between Putin and Western leaders including Cameron and French President Francois Hollande.","David Cameron held tense 50 minute meeting with Putin over Ukraine .

"Two criminals have been jailed after they robbed a delivery driver at gunpoint for a £30 takeaway. Dale Barker, 18, and Liam Donovan, 19, ordered two mains, a naan and papadums and had it sent to a nearby address so they could steal it. When the delivery driver arrived they held an imitation gun to his head and then took the curry home for dinner. Takeaway robbers: Dale Barker (left) and Liam Donovan (right) have been jailed for snatching a curry from a delivery driver at gunpoint . Cambridgeshire Police then raided Barker's home and found the two men hiding in the bathroom with the curry leftovers in another room, a court heard. After being arrested both teenagers blamed each other for the attack. They both pleaded guilty to robbery and having an imitation firearm with intent to commit an offence and were given custodial sentences at young offender's institutions. Speaking after the hearing the victim, Farrukh Haque, 49, said: 'I saw one guy outside the door and he asked me: ""Is that an Indian takeaway?"" I said: ""Yes."" 'He gave me his left hand and I put the food in it. With his right hand he stuck the gun to my head. 'I was really scared. At that time I didn't know if it was a real gun or a fake gun, I just thought it was a real gun. It was dark and we were in the shadow of the trees.' Cambridge Crown Court heard how the attackers ordered the takeaway from Dawaat Indian restaurant in Cambridge at 8.10pm on January 5. Meal: The two teenagers have been sent to prison for stealing two curries, a naan and papadums (file picture), and it was revealed Donovan had done it before . The court heard how it was the second time Donovan had been convicted of stealing a curry at gunpoint following a similar incident in March 2012. Barker, of Cambridge, received a lesser sentence of 28 months in a young offenders' institution, to reflect his earlier guilty plea to the attack. Donovan, of Cambridge, received a three year sentence in a young offenders institution. Sentencing on Friday, Judge Jonathan Haworth said it was a 'pre-planned attack conducted at night time.' The judge told the attackers: 'You have both spent the last couple of years repeatedly appearing before the magistrates for offences of violence and dishonesty. 'You hatched a plan to order a take away, to ask for it to be delivered to an address that was not your true address, and when the waiter got to that address one of you was wearing a scarf round your head and held a pistol to his head. 'You each blamed each other for holding the pistol to the take away worker's head and you each accepted responsibility for the plan. 'This will be the first custodial sentence for both of you.'","Dale Barker and Liam Donovan ordered £30 of curry, naan and papadums .

"Death: Deborah Levey, 44, was found dead at her home in Chichester, West Sussex in January 2013 . A mother was murdered by her ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ lover weeks after she had a hysterectomy to beat cervical cancer, a court heard. Phillip Brown allegedly smothered Debbie Levey, 44, in the living room of her country cottage, having told her: ‘You’ve taken away our chances of having a baby.’ Friends said the couple’s on-off relationship veered from ‘a Mills and Boon romance to a Stephen King horror’. Miss Levey tried to break up with Brown, whom she had described as a Jekyll and Hyde character, two months before her death after finding out he stole £10 from her. However, the ‘obsessive’ Brown would not take no for an answer, Lewes Crown Court heard. The prosecution told how Miss Levey, a care home worker from East Ashling, West Sussex, was bombarded with text messages. Mark Dennis QC said Brown would proclaim his love for the mother of one – but then send aggressive messages. In some he threatened to kill himself, and sent a picture of his own slashed wrists. Mr Dennis continued: ‘Most hurtful and spiteful of all was a message prior to her operation in which he expressed the hope that she would die [afterwards], adding that “you’ve taken our chances away of having a baby”.’ The pair, who had both been married and divorced twice before, met through work in January 2012 and began ‘an intense and highly charged relationship’, the court heard. Scene: Phillip Brown allegedly smothered his on-off girlfriend in the living room of her country cottage (pictured), having told her: 'You've taken away our chances of having a baby' Claims: Miss Levey (pictured) and Brown had an 'intense and highly charged relationship', the court heard . The . couple had talked about getting engaged, and Miss Levey had an earlier . sterilisation procedure reversed in the hope of giving Brown a baby. However, . she tried to break things off that November, just before her . hysterectomy, when Brown sold some jewellery for her only to . short-change her by £10. The . court heard that on the night before her death last January, Miss Levey . told neighbour Alison McQuaid: ‘I fear for my life with that man.’ The witness added: ‘He was a constant presence, constantly abusive to her. She said she was at her wits’ end.’ 'Foul play': Following the murder, Brown allegedly tried to cover his tracks by sending text messages to Miss Levey expressing concern that she was not replying . Miss . Levey was found dead at Cherry Tree Cottage the next morning with fresh . love-bites on her neck when a colleague called in on her ahead of a . planned trip that day. The victim’s mobile phone was in the fish tank. Mr . Dennis said a post-mortem examination found no natural cause of death . but there were ‘tell-tale signs’ of asphyxia by suffocation. The prosecution said Brown’s DNA was found on Miss Levey’s face, hands and left foot, and matched the saliva on her neck. Mr . Dennis said: ‘Having spent time together, both drinking and engaging in . no doubt earnest conversation about their future, there came a point . when the fragility of their relationship was exposed once again. Denial: Brown, who denies one count of murder, says he was not at Miss Levey's house on the night  she died . 'The . deceased, who was by then heavily in drink, would have been in no . position to have resisted a sudden outburst of aggression at the hands . of the defendant.’ The . prosecution said Brown then tried to cover his tracks by sending text . messages to Miss Levey expressing concern that she was not replying. Brown, who denies one count of murder, says he was not at Miss Levey’s house on the night of her death. The trial continues.

"Nearly half the families in the country have just one child, according to an official analysis. It found the number of one-child families has increased by almost 700,000 in 15 years, and they are likely to be in the majority within a decade. The Office for National Statistics said larger families are under pressure because of ‘the greater challenge of combining work with childcare with three or more children compared with one or two’. Almost half of families now only have one child, new analysis from the Office for National Statistics reveals . Many families can no longer afford to . have more than a single baby, experts said. Most mothers now have to go . out to work to pay the bills. And those who stay at home to bring up . their children are increasingly penalised by the tax and benefit system. When the ONS Labour Force Survey . started asking about the size of families in 1996, there were just over . three million with a mother, father and one  child – around 42 per cent . of all families with children. Last year there were  3.7million, or 47 . per cent of all families with children. Some critics fear the decline of the . traditional family with 2.4 children may lead to a generation of ‘little . emperors’, a phrase coined in China, where the rule of one child for . every couple is said to have produced millions of spoilt youngsters. The survey found there are now three . million families with two children, roughly the same as in the . mid-1990s. But as a share of all families, two-child households had . fallen from 41 per cent to 39 per cent. Since 1996, one-child families have increased in number to 3,663,000, while the number of larger families has fallen . The average number of children in a family is now 1.7, compared to more than two a generation ago, while the ONS found larger families are more like to not have a parent in work . Dr Terri Apter, of Cambridge . University, says: . 'There is a concern that singletons will not learn to . share, and will grown up ""spoiled"". There is however little evidence . for this. 'Though children do learn a great deal from siblings, and generally . benefit from the cooperation and competition they practice on a daily basis . among siblings, singletons also live in a world populated by other people, with . whom they identify and with whom they have to compete, and with whom they learn . to share. 'They have many opportunities to learn from their friends . about closeness and conflict; they have many opportunities to learn that they . cannot have everything their own way; they have many opportunities to learn . that they gain a great deal through sharing. 'Humans are naturally social . beings, and generally want to contribute to their society. 'Incidentally, . singletons tend to be very curious about what having a sibling would be like, . and wonder what kind of a sibling they would make.' Sophie Zadeh, research assistant at Cambridge University's Centre for Family Research adds: . 'Research to date seems to indicate that it is the quality of family relationships, rather than the number of people in a family, that matters most for children's social, psychological and emotional well-being. 'Some of our latest research has been on single women who have used a sperm donor to have a child. Some of these homes are comprised of mother and (only) child and these children seem to be functioning well.' The biggest decline came among . families with three or more children. There were more than 1.3million . such  families in 1996, but only 1.1million in 2012. They formed 14 per . cent of all families with children, compared with 17 per cent in 1996. The number of big families has . remained relatively high largely because of the impact of Pakistani and . Bangladeshi migrants, among whom there is less expectation that mothers . should work and bigger families are more common. The report said high proportions of . families with three or more children can be found in London, parts of . the West Midlands, including Birmingham, and parts of the North, . including Bradford. It added: ‘This may be related to the . ethnicities of people living in these areas, as previous research has . shown fertility rates in the UK are higher among women born in . Bangladesh and Pakistan than women born in the UK.’ The authoritative survey, based on a . sample of 130,000 people across Britain, found parents with large . families  are more likely to live on state benefits than those with . smaller ones. Only 5 per cent of couples with one or . two children  are workless, the report said, but 13 per cent of those . with three or more are dependent on benefits. ‘Families with one or two dependent . children are more likely to have at least one employed parent than those . with three or more dependent children,’ the report said. The insurance company Aviva, which . monitors the cost of raising children, said: ‘Our latest Family Finances . Report unearthed a similar trend to the ONS data. ‘The practicalities such as feeding . and clothing are expensive enough, but if a parent wants to return to . work and childcare fees come into play, this takes the cost of a child . to a whole new level. One-child families could well become the norm.’ A map of England and Wales reveals larger families concentrated in areas with higher proportions of women born in Bangladesh and Pakistan . Around 15 per cent of households in the UK have three or more children, putting it seventh in the European league table . Caroline Jones with her daughter Mia . Parents who choose to have only one child face being called lazy and selfish, according to mother-of-one Caroline Jones. She said she has been challenged repeatedly by friends and families over when she and husband Colin are planning a younger brother or sister for daughter, Mia. ‘The idea of a huge close-knit ¬family, living constantly in each other’s pockets, never held any attraction for me. It sounded far too chaotic and claustrophobic,’ she wrote last year. ‘My rule of thumb has always been that there should never be more children than bathrooms in a home. ‘Before you have children, people hold back a little. After all, you may have undisclosed fertility problems and be secretly desperate for a baby. ‘But once you’ve had one child, it’s open season. People just ask outright as if they’re talking about the local bus service: ‘So, when’s number two going to arrive?’ ‘My view is that, unlike parents of large families, we will be able to devote all our time, money and love into turning Mia into a happy, confident little girl. And a raft of recent research backs us up. ‘Obviously one key factor is that we’re all feeling the economic pinch, with parents simply unable to afford the extra cost of another child (a staggering £1,800 before they’re even born, according to one survey last month). ‘Another huge factor in the rise of single-child families is the trend for women to have babies later in life. UK birth records show that a woman having her first child at 35 is much less likely than a 25 year old to have more children. As fertility declines post-35, many women just run out of time. ‘At the end of the day, it’s not about romance, money, the agony of childbirth or all the research that proves how damaging sibling rivalry can be. ‘The honest truth is that Mia is all I want. She’s perfect and I’m done. So no matter how many times I’m asked when I’ll be having my next one, I won’t be changing my mind.’","In 1996 there were 3.1million only-child families, rising to 3.7million in 2012 .

"Ruling: British soldiers may not hold their enemies in Afghanistan as prisoners for longer than 96 hours, Mr Justice Leggatt ruled yesterday . British soldiers may not hold their enemies in Afghanistan as prisoners for longer than 96 hours because to do so would breach their human rights, a judge ruled yesterday. It means that Taliban chieftains captured by British troops must be freed to fight again within four days. The judgment – which followed claims brought by four Taliban commanders now held in Afghan jails – alarmed military chiefs and politicians. They believe soldiers should not be asked to fight and die on the battlefield according to the letter of human rights law. The 117-page High Court ruling by Mr Justice Leggatt means that the European Convention on Human Rights, and the UK’s Human Rights Act, which made the convention part of British law, apply wherever British troops are fighting. The judge said that by detaining Taliban leader Serdar Mohammed for 106 days beyond the legal 96-hour limit, Britain had breached his right to liberty. Taxpayers will now have to pay compensation running into tens of thousands to Mohammed and three other captives involved in the case. The ruling also opens the way for many other Afghan detainees to sue for compensation, with British law firms likely to be queuing up to help them. There will also be high legal costs for the taxpayer. Two legal firms represented the Taliban prisoners on no-win no-fee deals, and the case involved 11 barristers. The MoD is likely to face a six-figure bill.The case revolved around the arrest and detention of Serdar Mohammed in April 2010. He said he was irrigating his family’s fields in Helmand province when British soldiers from a helicopter arrested him. Mohammed said he was then blindfolded, assaulted and bitten by a military dog. Jail: It means that Taliban chieftains captured by British troops must be freed to fight again within four days . But Ministry of Defence lawyers said that British soldiers trying to capture a Taliban commander landed under heavy fire, and then gave chase to Mohammed and a second insurgent, whom they killed. Mohammed was bitten by a dog sent in to dig him out of a field after he refused to surrender. Soldiers found a rocket propelled grenade launcher and two rounds of ammunition for it abandoned along the trail down which he had fled. The prisoner was held by the British and questioned for nearly a month. Because Afghan authorities had no room in their prisons for him, he was held by the British until finally handed over to Afghan authorities on July 25, 2010. Lawyer: The judgment - which followed claims brought by four Taliban commanders now held in Afghan jails - alarmed military chiefs and politicians. Above, lawyer Phil Shiner represented three of the Afghans . The judge said it was ‘clear law’ that the Human Rights Act binds the armed forces in Afghanistan. He said: ‘The UK Government had no legal basis either under Afghan law or in international law for detaining [Serdar Mohammed] after 96 hours.’ After the case, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the MoD would appeal against the ruling. ‘We cannot send our armed forces into battle with both hands tied behind their backs,’ he warned. ‘Our troops must be able to detain our enemies who aim to maim and kill UK service personnel and innocent civilians. It cannot be right for the European Convention on Human Rights to apply on the battlefield, restricting the ability of our troops to operate in combat.’ Warning: Chief of the General Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton said: 'Our freedom to conduct detention operations' is 'vital to our ability to protect the lives of innocent civilians and our forces' Chief of the General Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton said: ‘Our freedom to conduct detention operations and to exploit detainees for intelligence is vital to our ability to protect the lives of innocent civilians and our own forces.’ A spokesman for Leigh Day, which represented Mohammed, said British troops will have to be instructed in human rights law. he three other Afghans were represented by Public Interest Lawyers, run by Left-wing solicitor Phil Shiner. In another case last month, the MoD said that Iraqi witnesses – represented by the firm – ‘dishonestly’ accused British soldiers of war crimes in Iraq because they were motivated by compensation. Yesterday Mr Shiner said: ‘This is a judgment of profound importance. It tells the MoD again that no matter how they try to avoid accountability for the UK’s actions abroad, international human rights law will apply and, thus, UK personnel must act accordingly.’ But Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘This is another illustration of what has gone wrong with our country.’ The four-day detention limit applies only to prisoners taken in Afghanistan. This is because the standard operating procedures of the UN-mandated International Security Assistance Force, the umbrella under which British armed forces serve in the country, sets a detention period of 96 hours. After this a prisoner must be released or handed to Afghan authorities. British ministers authorised detention beyond this time in November 2009, when it became clear that British courts were ready to ban prisoner handovers to the Afghans because of the risk of torture. Anywhere else in the world, detention periods would be likely to be set locally, but British forces would still have to comply with the human rights convention. Article Five of the convention says detainees must be brought ‘promptly’ before a judge and given a trial within a ‘reasonable time’. A judge would decide what was ‘prompt’ or ‘reasonable’.","Mr Justice Leggatt made the 117-page High Court judgement yesterday .

"A terror suspect who trained the ringleader of the 7/7 terrorist bombings in London has been allowed to set up an Islamic primary school, teaching children as young as three, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. As a member of a banned extremist group, Sajeel Shahid, 38, called for violence against British troops and ran a training camp in Pakistan where known terrorists learned how to make bombs and fire rocket- propelled grenades. One of his ‘graduates’ was Mohammed Siddique Khan, who led the gang of four suicide bombers on the deadliest terrorist attack ever committed in Britain, killing 52 people on the London Underground and a bus on July 7, 2005. Boss: Ad-Deen school founder Sajeel Sahid, 38, called for violence against British troops and ran a training camp in Pakistan where known terrorists learned how to make bombs and fire rocket- propelled grenades . Shahid also allegedly trained four convicted terrorists who tried to blow up the Bluewater Shopping Centre in Kent and London’s  Ministry of Sound nightclub in a foiled plot. The jihadist – who was raised in Britain but spent years in Pakistan after the 9/11 attacks – was detained for three months in 2005 by the Pakistani security forces over his suspected links to Al Qaeda. He had been running the Pakistan branch of the banned British extremist group Al-Muhajiroun. After his detention he was expelled from the country. But despite being known to British security services, on his return to the UK he was given permission to set up an independent primary school, where he taught lessons and employed his brother – who also has a history of extremism – as head of IT. Independent school: Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday show Shahid was registered as director and proprietor of the Ad-Deen Primary School in Ilford, Essex, which teaches 54 pupils aged three to 11 . The Department for Education said last night it was ‘urgently’ looking into Shahid’s case, which critics said exposed the lack of checks on potentially dangerous individuals who set up schools in the UK. Lord Carlile, the Government’s former adviser on counter-terrorism, said: ‘It is a matter of real concern that somebody should be able to slip through the net and run a school where there has been substantial concern about his activities in the past. 'People who have been involved in terrorist activity anywhere in the world should not be allowed to run schools, unless there is the clearest evidence they have rejected the views that made them turn towards terrorism.’ Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee which is investigating terrorism, including extremism in schools, said: ‘It’s extremely worrying a person with such a history, which should be of concern to the relevant authorities, should be in such a position. The DfE needs to look into this urgently.’ Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday show Shahid was registered as director and proprietor of the Ad-Deen Primary School in Ilford, Essex, which teaches 54 pupils aged three to 11. He is thought to have founded the £2,000-a-year school in 2009, where, using the pseudonym Abu Ibrahim, he taught children to recite the Koran. He was able to operate his school for five years, despite the DfE launching a Due Diligence and Counter-Extremism Unit in 2010 to prevent individuals with a history of extremist beliefs running schools. A cursory internet check on Shahid reveals his past as a terror suspect, as he even has a profile on Wikipedia stating his involvement with Al-Muhajiroun, the group founded by Omar Bakri Mohammed. In 2001, Bakri sent Shahid and his elder brother Adeel, 39, also a member of Al-Muhajiroun, to Pakistan to set up a branch of the group there. In December 2001, Shahid gave an interview to a British newspaper. He said: ‘We say the Pakistan army, navy and air-force should be fighting US and British forces which are killing our Islamic brothers and sisters in Afghanistan. We see the US and British governments as the biggest terrorists in the world.’ He also called on Muslims to rise up and ‘throw out their rulers implementing kufr [infidel] laws to be replaced by the Islamic law and order,’ adding, ‘jihad was the only solution for Muslim lands under occupation.’ Bomber: Mohammed Sidique Khan, 30, working as a teaching mentor in a classroom at a school in the Beeston area of Leeds before leading the gang of four extremists who carried out Britain's worst-ever terror attack . More details of Shahid’s activities in . Pakistan emerged at the Old Bailey trial of seven terrorists who . plotted to blow up the Bluewater Centre and the Ministry of Sound with . half a ton of fertiliser. The . court heard evidence from Muhammed Junaid Babar, 39, a US terrorist who . became an FBI supergrass on Al Qaeda, who had met Shahid and his . brother in Pakistan in 2001. Babar . revealed they accommodated British jihadists in safe houses in Lahore, . before they left for Afghanistan to fight the Americans. According . to transcripts obtained by the MoS, Babar told the court that in 2003 . he and Shahid and two others travelled to a region near the Afghan . border and set up a terrorist training camp in Malakand. Babar . told the jury that in August 2003, the would-be ringleader of the 7/7 . attacks, Mohammed Siddique Khan, 30, trained at the Malakand camp with . Mohammed Shakil, 37, a friend from Leeds. He was jailed in 2009 for . seven years for attending the camp. Khan, . who was known at the camp as Ibrahim, and Shakil, known as Zubair, were . joined by four other Brits, who were led by Omar Khyam, 34, who was . later convicted as the ringleader of the Bluewater plot. In . 2005, the Shahid brothers were arrested by security forces in Pakistan . on suspicion of supporting and having links with Al Qaeda and were . detained for three months. Horror: The remains of a London bus after the attacks on July 7, 2005, in which 54 people were killed . Security sources told The Mail on Sunday that Sajeel Shahid was ‘on MI5’s radar’ after he was expelled from Pakistan and returned to the UK, but slipped towards the bottom of their priority list as he was not deemed a national security threat. He has never been charged with any terrorism offences. But last night, questions were asked as to how Shahid’s past was not uncovered by the DfE despite background vetting, which include enhanced criminal records checks. Electronic records sent to Companies House indicate that Shahid resigned from Ad-Deen early this month, although a staff member said that he ‘still goes in and out’ and can be reached at the school. He did not respond to our calls. Ofsted inspected the school in 2011 and 2012 without apparently discovering Shahid’s past, concluding it met ‘all regulatory requirements’. Last night, Ofsted refused to answer any questions on what checks it made on the background of Ad-Deen’s staff and proprietor. The DfE spokesman said: ‘We will investigate any evidence put to us.’","Sajeel Shahid ran a camp where he taught combat and bomb-making skills .

"A 'jealous' wife who stabbed her husband’s pregnant ex-lover in the stomach was jailed for 10 years today. Andrea Dean attacked Stacey Jenkins outside a primary school in Liverpool when the victim was 37 weeks pregnant with her husband Christopher's baby, the city’s crown court was told. Dean knifed Ms Jenkins seven times with a 10cm filleting knife striking her abdomen, leg, hand and arm. Jealous: Andrea Dean, pictured left, stabbed Stacey Jenkins, pictured right, outside a primary school in Liverpool when she was 37 weeks pregnant with her husband Christopher's baby . Miraculously, the 28-year-old victim and her unborn child survived and the baby girl, named Hope, was born at full term three weeks later. Dean, 40, of Kremlin Drive, Liverpool, was sentenced today after earlier pleading guilty to wounding with intent and attempted child destruction. Her 'weak' husband, Christopher, also 40, was sentenced to 30 months after pleading guilty to assisting an offender, perverting the course of justice and aiding and abetting his wife. The court heard he had driven his wife to the confrontation, although he did not know she was armed with the knife, and afterwards hid the weapon and gave her a false alibi. Jailed: Christopher Dean was jailed for 30 months for assisting an offender, perverting the course of justice and aiding and abetting his wife . Jailing the couple, Recorder Clement Goldstone, QC, said Dean had made no secret of her animosity towards Ms Jenkins. He told her: 'The pregnancy was a source of great annoyance and jealousy to you. 'Not only because the father was your husband and he had fathered another child outside your marriage, but also because you had been trying, unsuccessfully, to have another, fourth child with your husband and your annoyance may have increased even further when you learned that the child which Stacey Jenkins was carrying was in fact a girl - you having three sons.' Turning to her former fishmonger husband, the judge said: 'You are a victim of your own weakness. 'You did not have the strength of character to stand up to your wife when you realised she was contemplating, if not an attack, then at least a confrontation with the woman who was heavily pregnant with your child.' Ms Jenkins, who attended court today, became pregnant with Christopher Dean's child in 2008 when they started a relationship after he had separated from his wife of 17 years. But the Deans soon reunited and he left Ms Jenkins to return to the matrimonial home. Andrea Dean found out about the pregnancy when Ms Jenkins posted images of a scan on Facebook. Ms Jenkins had also posted photographs on the website of her daughter in school uniform, and Dean was able to work out she attended a primary school in Tuebrook, Liverpool. She became increasingly angry and jealous and, the court heard, she urged her husband to 'stab' his former lover and said that if he did not, she would. On November 8 last year the couple set off to confront Ms Jenkins and, unknown to her husband, Dean was armed. She lay in wait outside the school with the knife hidden inside her boot. Christopher Dean, left, started a relationship with Stacey Jenkins after separating from his wife Andrea, right. But the married couple then reunited and Christopher Dean left Ms Jenkins who was pregnant with his child . Witnesses said that as Ms Jenkins walked by, Dean bent down as if to tie her shoelaces.She then pulled the knife from her boot and lunged at Ms Jenkins. In her police statement, the victim said: 'I put my arms across my stomach to protect my unborn baby. 'She was almost on top of me, bent over me and stabbed me again in the right side of my stomach. I rolled over on to my side to protect my stomach and made myself into the foetal position. 'She was trying to roll me over to expose my stomach but I started kicking her to get her away from me and as I did, she stabbed me in the thigh.' The judge said: 'Miraculously, none of Stacey Jenkins' injuries were life threatening. 'She recovered at least from her physical injuries though the psychological trauma will no doubt live with her and continue to do so. 'Equally, if not more miraculously, her unborn daughter survived before being delivered at full term three weeks later. 'What an irony, in the circumstances of what you have done to her, that she should have named that child, Hope.'

"A war veteran and his wife died within days of each other after being put on the Liverpool Care Pathway without consent. Charles Futcher, 90, who fought in the battle of El Alamein, died alone in a care home after he was put on the controversial end-of-life process. Ten days later his wife Hilda, 89, died in the same home after she too was given sedatives and had vital food and fluids withdrawn under pathway procedures. Charles and Hilda Futcher died within ten days of one another after being put on sedatives while on Liverpool Care Pathway 'without family consent' Their son, Charlie, said his parents had been treated ‘like animals who needed to be put down’ by doctors who ‘seemed to take it upon themselves to get rid of them’. The 62-year-old, who was at his mother’s side when she died, said the couple’s treatment had been grotesque and claimed they were put on the pathway without consultation. Just two weeks before his death, Mr Futcher had celebrated his 90th birthday at a family party. ‘He was in a wheelchair and was in discomfort, but he was compos mentis and you could speak to him about anything, he was sharp,’ his son said. Son Charles Jr said his parents were treated like 'animals who needed to be put down' When . his sister received a telephone call from the care home to tell her . that their father, a former ambulance driver, had been put on sedatives, . Mr Futcher Jr did not think it meant he was seriously ill. As a result, . the old soldier died without any of his family being present. Mr . Futcher Jr said: ‘I would not have wanted my father to suffer if he had . been riddled with cancer or his diabetes was killing him, or if he had . made the decision to go. ‘I would have just liked to have been there with him. ‘But somebody else was making those decisions and not telling us.’ After his father died, Mr Futcher Jr, a former teacher who owns a hotel in the Peak District of Derbyshire, lost all faith in those caring for his mother at the care home in Petersfield, Hampshire. ‘I just didn’t trust them so I stayed with her all the time,’ he said. ‘Her dementia was quite bad, but she knew people. ‘She couldn’t hold a conversation any more but she knew who I was and would give me a hug.’ Mr Futcher Jr claims that within days of his father’s death, care home staff stopped giving his mother food or fluids and her health deteriorated rapidly. He said: ‘They were telling me that she’d forgotten how to eat and when I arrived there she was so frail. ‘I held her hand up to the light and could see the blood going through her veins, that’s the state they got her into. We had a family friend there and I said, “There’s no way that my mother is refusing food and we have to get some fluids in there”. ‘I went and bought a baby’s feeding bottle and put some water into it and she just sucked it down. You just couldn’t pull it out of her mouth.’ Praise: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the pathway as 'a fantastic step forward' Mr . Futcher Jr claims the same GP who allowed his father to be put on the . Liverpool Care Pathway authorised district nurses to put his mother on . sedatives without his even having visited her. He . added: ‘It was a grotesque death. When I watched my mother die over . those 33 hours she was so thin and dehydrated, it actually changed the . shape of her head. ‘It’s . like taking your animals to the vet. I’ve got dogs and they get old and . you agree to put them down. It’s no different to that, no different at . all.’ Norman Boyes, practice manager at the Swan Surgery in Petersfield, where Mr and Mrs Futcher’s doctor worked, said: ‘We are sorry if anyone is unhappy with the care and advice provided. ‘The practice has a formal complaints procedure, and we would encourage any of the family members who have any concerns to contact us directly.’ Mr Futcher Jr’s Czech-born mother was at a wartime refugee camp when she met his father, who was on duty there after serving in the Eighth Army under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. The Liverpool Care Pathway is designed to ease the suffering of terminally ill patients in their final hours and can involve the withdrawal of foods and fluids as well as the use of sedatives such as morphine. Yesterday the Mail revealed that up to 60,000 patients die on the pathway each year without giving their consent. Yet Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has described the pathway as ‘a fantastic step forward’ – and dismissed concerns as based on matters ‘going wrong in one or two cases’. ‘It’s basically designed to bring hospice-style care to terminally ill people in hospitals,’ he said. Mr Hunt added that many patients did not want to die ‘with lots of tubes going in and out of their body’ but would prefer their last moments to be dignified.","War veteran Charles Futcher died after being put on Liverpool Care Pathway .

"Vicky Sewart, pictured in her jewellery shop in Plymouth, opted to treat her condition with a health regime involving exercise and special foods . A breast cancer patient refused to take powerful drugs she  was offered to stop the disease returning – and chose to depend on a spicy low-fat diet instead. Following surgery, Vicky Sewart, 44, was worried about possible side-effects from taking the medication. So instead, she launched herself into a health regime of exercise and specially chosen foods, including turmeric, which she claims ‘makes cancer cells commit suicide’. Experts have warned there is little scientific evidence to back up her claims. But Miss Sewart believes that the diet she followed after undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery was a vital part of her recovery from the disease. Her experience will now form part of an academic study into how lifestyle can affect the body’s response to cancer. After she was diagnosed, Miss Sewart did her own research into which foods might have a positive impact on her recovery. And following an operation to remove a breast and lymph node four years ago, she told doctors she would not take Tamoxifen during remission but would be following her own ‘anti-cancer’ diet instead. She said: ‘It’s very unusual for breast cancer patients not to take the drug. ‘When I told the doctors I didn’t want to take it, they just advised me to keep oestrogen out of my body, which is basically what the drug does. 'The doctors absolutely will not say that the diet is going to do anything to help the cancer in any way, other than to say a healthy diet is going to help in the fight against any disease. Recovering: A picture of Vicky in Antigua, 2008. Concerned about the side-effects of medical drug Tamoxifen Miss Sewart, 44, designed a vegan, diary free diet which included a range of superfoods from frozen berries to curry spices . This was four years ago and I think . attitudes are changing a bit now so that these ideas are running . alongside the more usual treatments. 'I believe absolutely enormously that my diet has assisted my recovery.’ Explaining her decision not to take . Tamoxifen, she went on: ‘It was the worry  of the drugs and the side . effects, I didn’t want to have to worry about it, I wanted  to be free.’ Turmeric, a spice used when making curry dishes . The jewellery designer and gallery . owner started her health regime with a mostly organic vegan diet, . cutting out all dairy products, adding plenty of ‘super-foods’, and . taking moderate exercise. She said: ‘Fresh fruit, vegetables . and juices are great, and frozen berries are fantastic as a super-food. Turmeric kind of makes cancer cells commit suicide and ginger and garlic . are great to cook with.’ For the past four years, Miss Sewart . has provided blood and urine samples and filled in regular . questionnaires as part of national research into how lifestyle can help . prevent the recurrence of breast cancer after surgery. The largest study of its kind in the world, it involves 56 hospitals around the UK and 3,400 patients who have had the disease. The full results will be published next year. Meanwhile, Miss Sewart, from . Plymouth, is hoping to mark her five-year remission next summer and is . due to marry later this year. Describing her experience of cancer, she added: ‘People can die, or come back from it and enjoy life. 'You’ve just got to be thankful you’re still around.’ Vicky Sweart used both frozen berries like strawberries and ginger root in her diet which she claims has helped recovery from breast cancer . However, experts urged other cancer sufferers not to abandon conventional treatments. Sara Hiom, of Cancer Research UK, . said: ‘It’s not recommended that alternative therapies are  used in . place of conventional medical therapy. ‘There is little scientific or . medical evidence to indicate that alternative therapies are more . effective than the proven treatments used by cancer specialists on the . NHS. 'We would urge anyone to talk to their specialist if they’re contemplating them.’ Dr Steve Kelly, who specialises  in . breast cancer at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, said: ‘Breast cancer . deaths have been going down steadily for over 20 years thanks to . surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. ‘But there are three things patients can do to help themselves. It doesn’t guarantee survival, but it does help. ‘The first is to exercise for 30 . minutes, three days a week. The second is to not gain any weight, and . the third is to reduce fat intake. ‘These things help to reduce the chance of cancer coming back. For this patient, four years on now, it is still early days.’ He added: ‘My job is not to make people have Tamoxifen, but advise people of the risks and benefits. 'Treatment comes down to a patient, and height, weight and exercise levels are helpful in making a decision.’ Tamoxifen is Britain’s most . widely-used breast cancer drug,  given to more than half of patients to . stop tumours from returning after surgery. The tablets, which cost as little as . aspirin and are taken for up to five years, also prevent the development . of new tumours in an unaffected breast. The drug, originally developed as a . contraceptive, is the gold standard treatment for breast cancer and has . been given to millions around the world since the 1980s. It works by blocking the female sex hormone oestrogen from fuelling the growth of tumours. Used after surgery, it cuts the odds of the tumour returning by around 30 per cent. However, it does not work in all cases. In contrast, the evidence for curry . spices such as turmeric beating cancer mainly comes from the study of . cells in a dish – while evidence from the treatment of actual patients . is sparse. In laboratory studies it seems to be . able to kill cancer cells and prevent more from growing, particularly in . breast, bowel, stomach and skin cancers. It has also been shown to appear to stop the spread of breast cancer cells to other parts of the body in mice.","Miss Sewart's diet bans dairy and meat and contains frozen berries, vegetables and spices such as garlic, turmeric and ginger .

"A 24-year-old male supermarket worker is preparing for a legal battle to become Britain's first single surrogate parent. Kyle Casson, from Doncaster, who is gay, says he has been thinking about having a child for a few years, but only now does he feel 'mature and financially stable enough' to do so. He wants to do it in his twenties, rather than wait for a partner, who may not come along. And, determined to achieve his ambition, he is going to take on the legal system and fight to legally adopt his own baby. Scroll down for video . Kyle Casson, pictured, wants to become the UK's first single surrogate parent at the age of 24 . Speaking on ITV's Daybreak on Monday, he said he had wanted a child for a while but now feels mature and financially stable enough to have one . Surrogacy is when a woman gives birth to a baby for - usually - a couple, who want to have a child. The eggs and sperm of the intended parents can be used or they can be donor eggs and/or donor sperm. While it is not illegal for single parents to enter into a surrogacy arrangement, the law currently prevents them applying for a parental order that they need to be able to raise their child in the UK. Natalie Gamble, from Natalie Gamble Associates, UK's leading experts in UK and international surrogacy law, told MailOnline that it was more difficult for a single woman to become a parent through surrogacy in the UK. Here she explains the law: . 'It is more difficult for . a single women because they won't have the same connection with the . baby, whereas the man would be the biological father. 'There is nothing in the law in the UK that makes it illegal to enter into a surrogacy arrangement as a single parent. 'But it doesn’t make it easy . either. Most parents through surrogacy (including gay dads and unmarried . couples) can apply for a ‘parental order’ after their child is born. 'This is an order made by the family . court which gives the intended parents a new birth certificate and . extinguishes the responsibilities of the surrogate mother. 'Single parents are not, however, eligible to apply. 'This means it is perfectly legal . for a man like Kyle to have a child through surrogacy in the UK, but the . normal solution for families created through surrogacy (designed to . give lifelong security and certainty for the child) is not available. 'He will have to get creative with . using law designed for other purposes to secure his family and resolve . the position of his surrogate – adoption being the best alternative to a . parental order if the family court will agree to help.' The law was extended, in 2008, to allow gay fathers and unmarried couples to apply for surrogacy. Currently no single man or woman in . Britain has been able to become a parent with the help of a donor egg . and a British surrogate. Some single men are believed to have travelled abroad to America or India where they have been able to father a child through surrogacy. But in Britain the law only allows two parents to apply for a parental order for any surrogate child born this way. The law doesn’t allow a single parent to do the same thing. Even though Kyle’s sperm will be used to fertilise the donor egg and a surrogate mother will carry the child to full-term, legally, he will still have no rights over the child even when it’s born. Instead he’ll have to try and adopt his own baby to get full custody - something else which has never been done before. Kyle has already found a British surrogate willing to carry the baby and a fertility clinic willing to help him with an egg donor but who will remain anonymous. His legal case cannot begin until the child is born. Kyle, a supermarket worker from Skellow, Doncaster said: 'The only thing I’ll be told about her is her physical features such as height, hair and eye colour but I plan to choose someone with features as close to mine as I can get. 'I’ve been thinking about it for a few years but it’s only recently that I feel I’m mature and financially stable enough to have a child. 'I own my own house, I’ve got a good job and a great family and friends supporting me.' Kyle admits that his plan is a big gamble with no guarantee that he’d be allowed to legally adopt his own baby. He said : 'I'm openly gay but I'm not in a relationship and I don't want to wait until I'm in a serious relationship to have a baby. 'Everything is in place to go ahead. I . have a close member of the family who will act as the surrogate mother I . just have to find an egg donor. 'After that I can legally take . custody when the child is born but then I want to legally adopt the . baby. I know it cost me thousands in legal fees but I have the money to . finance it and I'm determined to go through with this. 'It’s never been done before. My lawyer . couldn’t tell me and still can’t say what will or might happen because . this has never been tried before. But to me it’s worth the risk. 'My lawyer says the case would initially . be heard in Doncaster but if I wasn’t allowed to adopt the case could . end up in the High Court but I’m willing to fight this all the way. 'I just hope that by doing this that . I’ll be able to help other single people wanting to become a parent . using a British surrogate.' Kyle says as the law stands would-be single parents are routinely discriminated against when it comes to using a British surrogate mother. Kyle could take his case as far as the High Court in a landmark legal battle to gain full rights of a child born through surrogacy . Kyle admits that his plan is a big gamble with no guarantee that he'd be allowed to legally adopt his own baby . Pregnancy: Surrogacy is when a woman gives birth to a baby for - usually - a couple, who want to have a child (file photo) Kyle was just four years old when his own mother Anne-Marie, separated from his biological father. He said : 'My twin brothers were only nine-months-old so mum was single parent to three children all under the age of five.' Anne-Marie later went on to marry Kyle’s dad Alan Casson, 43, who adopted all three boys and raised them as his own. 'My mum was a single parent before she met my dad so who’s to say I won't meet someone in the future,' he added. Kyle has discussed the plan with his family and added : 'I’ve got an amazing family - everyone’s behind me. 'No one has said a negative word about it because they know how much I want this. I’ve really thought about it for such a long time. 'I’ve gone over every last detail time and time again - I’ve not taken this decision lightly.' Natalie Gamble, Kyle's solicitor and an expert in surrogacy law, said Kyle's legal case cannot being until a . surrogate child has been born. She said: 'It is only then that the . legal process can begin to challenge the provisions of a parental order. It is not illegal but the fact that there is no provision in the law . for a single person to apply for a parental order. 'It is difficult to assess what a legal challenge would cost but there is no provision for legal aid in this sort of case.'We frequently see heartbreaking cases caused by the denial of surrogacy to single parents. 'A change to the law would benefit not only prospective solo dads like Kyle, but also single women who have survived cancer and need the help of a surrogate to carry their child, and widowed fathers who want to use embryos in storage, just as widowed mothers are able to do.'","Kyle Casson says he feels 'mature and financially stable enough' to raise a child and does not want to wait for partner who may not come along .

"Britain has finally hit David Cameron's controversial foreign aid target, spending more than £11.2billion in a year. But the news came at the same time that it was revealed that millions of taxpayers' money is helping to prop up the most corrupt regimes in the world. A study by the respected organisation Transparency International (TI) reveals that virtually all of the countries with the most serious corruption problems receive lavish aid from Britain. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. Britain sends £756,000 a year to the country . Detailed figures show that we sent funding to all ten of the worst offending nations in 2012. Between them they received almost £500million from the British taxpayer. The Prime Minister's goal of devoting 0.7 per cent of Britain's income to foreign aid was reached yesterday. The target required a 30 per cent increase in the foreign aid budget last year – making it more than the amount set aside for the entire Home Office. But the revelations about corruption will fuel concern that much of the aid never reaches those it is intended for. Tory MP Peter Bone said: 'I am sure ministers take what precautions they can, but the situation in many of these countries is so bad that there is no way of knowing where the money ends up. 'It all comes down to this ridiculous artificial target which means we have to send more and more money every time the economy improves, rather than having a real assessment of need. 'It is a really dangerous system … it just plays into the hands of corrupt politicians and officials.' TI identifies the Somalian regime as the most corrupt and the World Bank rates the country as one of the worst governed in the world. But in 2012 Britain gave the impoverished African nation £86.8million. Somalia is one of a number of countries where aid is channelled through charities and agencies rather than central government in a bid to sidestep corruption. But a report in December found many of these organisations were forced to hand over large sums of cash to terrorist group Al-Shabaab in return for protection. Britain also sent more than £200million to Afghanistan – rated as the world's third most corrupt regime. The money was given despite a report from the Independent Commission for Aid Impact two years ago which warned British aid was at risk of theft, corruption and fraud. The watchdog said 'significant improvements' were needed to protect taxpayers' money. Newly formed South Sudan received £107million in British aid, but also has a dismal record for corruption. TI ranks the troubled state as the fourth most corrupt. In 2012 South Sudan's parliament suspended 75 officials in a scandal involving the theft of £2.6billion from the fledgling country. Syria, one of the fastest risers in TI's annual corruption index, received £38.5million in 2012 – a figure thought to have increased dramatically in the past year as the humanitarian crisis worsened. Earlier this month the Government suspended non-lethal military aid to northern Syria because of evidence it was falling into the hands of rebel groups linked to Al Qaeda. Other corrupt nations enjoying British funding include Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – 19th and 23rd in the index – which were both handed £139million. Pakistan, was given £197million despite being the 31st most corrupt. The Department for International Development (DfID) said it has a zero tolerance approach to corruption and that there were 'rigorous checks to protect taxpayers' money'. A DfID spokesman said: 'Stopping terrorism, money laundering and tax evasion in the world's most dangerous places is firmly in our own national interest. Fighting poverty and corruption will help to end aid dependency more quickly.' Around £750,000 of taxpayers' money is given to North Korea through the Foreign Office but this goes to aid agencies, not the autocratic regime. A FCO spokesman said the British Embassy in Pyongyang provides 'a very small amount of funding to individual community projects' for 'vulnerable groups'. The huge rise in British aid is in stark contrast to other developed countries, most of which are slashing their aid programmes. United Nations figures reveal that average aid spending is 0.29 per cent of income – less than half what Britain has budgeted.","Study carried out by respected organisation Transparency International .

"Children as young as give are being treated for depression and anxiety, according to shock NHS figures. NHS Solent, which covers Southampton and Portsmouth, revealed it had 324 young people suffering from depression referred to it between September 2010 and August 2011. Another 378 patients, aged 16 and under, were referred for a range of mental health therapies. Modern scourge: Children as young as give are being treated for depression and anxiety, according to shock NHS figures . These included cognitive behaviour therapy, anxiety management and art and play therapy, with the youngest of those aged just two. Barbara Inkson, child clinical psychology at Solent NHS Trust, said: 'Levels of emotional disorders, including depression as well as anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders, are rising.' She said they were seeing an annual increase of about 10 per cent in referrals. Meanwhile, the NHS Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service in Sussex estimated it was working with about 330 under-11s and 830 12 to 18-year-olds with anxiety and/or depression. Experts said children are coming under increasing stress because of unemployment, financial problems and substance abuse among their parents. Sarah Brennan, chief executive of Young Minds, said: 'Intervening early when a child or young person starts struggling to cope is proven to reduce the likelihood of that young person developing much more severe and entrenched mental health problems. 'It is vital that we invest in children and young people’s mental health in order to prevent a generation of children suffering entrenched mental health problems as adults.' In February, MPs announced an extra £22million will be set aside to tackle child mental health treatment. Nationally, one in ten children aged between five and 16 years old has a clinically diagnosable mental health problem. Half of adults with long-term mental health problems will have experienced their first symptoms before the age of 14.","NHS Solent reveals that 324 young people suffering from depression were referred to it in one year .

"A student has taken the NekNominate craze for dangerous dares to new heights by downing a pint in the cockpit of a plane. Thorfinn Stout, 21, uploaded a video of himself in the front seat of a light aircraft with one hand on the control column and the other holding what appears to be a pint of lager. It is not clear who filmed the Stirling University student, originally from Kirkwall, Orkney, while he was carrying out the stunt. Scroll down for video . Dangerous: Thorfinn Stout, 21, was filmed with one hand on the control column and the other holding what appears to be a pint of lager . The Stirling University student, originally from Kirkwall, Orkney, was a passenger rather than co-pilot . But Civil Aviation Authority rules make it clear that it is illegal for a passenger to be drunk aboard an aircraft. Mr Stout was a passenger rather than co-pilot and there is nothing to suggest he is intoxicated. The head of one Scottish flying school said they banned all alcohol in their light aircraft because they 'do not mix'. Mr Stout, who is reading business studies and sports studies, is heard in the video saying: 'Ready for a pint.' As Mr Stout downs the pint in one, his hands are on the controls of the plane in front of him. After posting it on his Facebook page, a friend called Andy Croy wrote: 'Haha quality mate. Reports of a small aircraft swerving over Kirkwall can be confirmed then.' A CAA leaflet on passenger safety in light aircraft states that pilots should 'not take passengers who are under the influence of alcohol (or anything worse)'. It adds: 'They could hazard the flight. Drunkenness in an aircraft is an offence under ANO 2009 Article 139.' Mr Stout, from Orkney, is reading business studies and sports studies at Stirling University. He could not be contacted for comment . The NekNominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global. The concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k.' The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet. One popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain bowl to lap it up. Another extreme example featured a woman riding a horse into a supermarket and  downing a can of Pepsi. However, the trend has taken a dark trend in recent weeks as reports have begun to emerge of young men dying after drinking huge amounts of alcohol for a dare. Jack Simpson, an instructor at Edinburgh Flying Club, said that it would be 'inadvisable' to let passengers on board a light aircraft drink any alcohol. Mr Simpson said: 'Alcohol and planes do not mix. If it is a passenger drinking it is not illegal but it is inadvisable. It's up to the pilot, but it is absolutely not advisable. 'We wouldn't allow anyone to take alcohol on the plane at all. We have a line that says there should be at least eight hours between the bottle and the throttle.' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said: 'Although passengers are not prohibited from drinking alcohol onboard an aircraft, they are legally obliged to follow the instructions of the pilot in command at all times. 'If a passenger's actions interfere with the pilot's control of the aircraft, they can be charged with recklessly endangering that aircraft, an offence taken very seriously by the courts, and which carries with it the possibility of a custodial sentence.' Mr Stout could not be contacted for comment. His mother, Anne Stout, from Kirkwall, said that her son was not the co-pilot, but did not wish to comment any further. In another NekNominate video, 29-year-old Samuel Dyer, from Haverfordwest, West Wales, was filmed risking his life to complete a dare. In these pictures he can be seen jumping off a cliff into rough seas while downing an alcoholic drink before being pushed under water by strong waves.

"Alan Crickmore will be sentenced today for plundering the estates of dead trustees in a bid to relieve his own debt . One of Britain’s longest serving coroners has been jailed for plundering £2million from the estates of dead people. Alan Crickmore, 57, received an eight-year sentence from a judge today following an 'absolutely chronic' string of deceitful crimes. The coroner from Gloucestershire admitted theft and fraud by abuse of position after a two-year police investigation last month. Southwark Crown Court heard today how the man continued to receive a £60,000 coroner salary for two years despite having his law firm closed down by the Solicitors . Regulation Authority in 2010. Crickmore was arrested in January 2011 following a two-year police probe into alleged irregularities at the firm, Alan C. Crickmore. But the man only resigned from his role as coroner last month, after pleading guilty to 24 charges of dishonesty in a Gloucestershire court. Crickmore started as deputy coroner for Gloucester in 1999 before becoming the city's coroner in 2002. In 2005 he also took on the role of the coroner for the Cotswolds and combined the two jobs to become the first coroner to cover the whole of Gloucestershire. Today, Prosecuting Mark Fenhalls told the court: ‘Mr Crickmore is a 57-year-old man who qualified as a solicitor in the 1980s and has been in practice in Gloucester since 1992. ‘He stole in various different ways about £2m from clients. ‘All of the money was stolen from clients either from their estates if they died or clients who were unable to understand.’ 'He chose to target the weak, vulnerable and those who could not look after their own interests.' Mr Fenhalls also described how the man used an 'entirely fraudulent' bookkeeping process to conceal his crimes. Upon sentencing, Judge Anthony Leonard QC told Crickmore: 'The offences are so serious only a custodial sentence would be justified,' adding he had never before come across a case where a solicitor had been so dishonest. 'I am driven to conclude that you preferred to continue a life of dishonesty rather than lose your position in the community ... including your role as coroner.' The court heard how Crickmore also took advantage of living clients, like 88-year-old dementia sufferer Clare Wilson who, in 2003, gave him power of attorney over her considerable assets. 'An entirely fraudulent system': The court heard how Crickmore noted 'costs' and 'loans' in his company books at Alan C. Crickmore solicitors to conceal his crimes . The court heard how Crickmore stole from deceased trustees in a 'frantic' bid to relieve debt caused by his ailing law firm (pictured) The family of one of the people . targeted by the conman said they are in discussions with solicitors to . determine compensation for their ordeal. Speaking outside court, Ian Goodwin said: 'I think justice has been served with Alan Crickmore.' 'But I'm very relieved the outcome has ended like this.' Jane Mitchell, specialist fraud lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'For a period of 13 years between 1998 and 2011, Alan Crickmore abused his position to systematically steal from and defraud his clients in order to fund an extravagant lifestyle he plainly could not legitimately afford. 'It is no coincidence that his largest money transfers took place directly before the cruises he went on with his wife.' In . Crickmore's defence, Edward Henry told the court he had been 'in a trap . of his own making for years, resulting in a significant effect on his . mental and physical health. 'He became a fraud to himself before he became a conman, I regret to submit, to his clients. 'He embarked on a frenzied attempt to balance the books and this was absolutely chronic over a period of over a decade. Alan C. Crickmore solicitors (pictured) was closed down in 2011 for 'irregularities' though Crickmore continued to receive his £60,000 coroner salary until this month . Crickmore was sentenced to eight years imprisonment by a judge at Southwark Crown Court today . ‘He has a significant history of depression and is completely broken by this. ‘He . was made bankrupt in 2011 and discharged from bankruptcy in 2012 only . because all of his assets were restrained for the purposes of . confiscation. 'He is relieved he can now live with the truth, where he had to live with his deceit for so long.' The defendant denied the prosecution's claims he enjoyed a 'lavish lifestyle that he couldn't afford', instead telling the court he stole as the result of his law firm's 'focus' on pro bono, coronal and charity work. A compensation hearing has been scheduled for victims of Crickmore's crimes for next year. At the time of his arrest, Crickmore was a director of the trust which runs the £13,000 St Edward's independent school in Charlton Kings, Cheltenham. He was born in St Helen’s, Merseyside, in 1956 and qualified as a solicitor  when he was 24-years-old. Assets worth £800,000 have since been frozen by officers, which include two properties in the names of his sons. A Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is due to take place on January 12, when it is hoped they will be seized and sold to recoup some of the clients’ lost money. They say Crickmore showed no remorse whatsoever.","Alan Crickmore stole from the estates of dead people to relieve own debt .

"A jilted lover distraught that his ex-girlfriend was in a new relationship broke into her home and hung himself on her four-poster bed to 'shock' her, an inquest heard. Matthew Nimmo died weeks after he was released from prison, where he had been serving a sentence for breaching a restraining order that banned him from contacting her. Coroner for County Durham Andrew Tweddle said that it was unclear whether Mr Nimmo intended to kill himself or just meant to shock his ex-girlfriend and her partner when they returned home. Claim: Jilted lover Matthew Nimmo hanged himself in the home of his ex-girlfriend, an inquest in Crook, County Durham heard, pictured . Detective Inspector Philip Curtis said Mr Nimmo, 35, of Darlington, County Durham, had been released from prison earlier in the year. On Thursday May 3, Mr Nimmo went to his ex’s house in the town where there was an altercation in which he got stabbed. Mr Curtis said four people were arrested after the incident, and it was still being investigated when, on Tuesday, May 15, Mr Nimmo went back to the house and met his ex. The police officer said they spent the afternoon talking to each other before they both left, with the ex-partner meeting her boyfriend and going to his mother’s house. When the couple returned home they then discovered Mr Nimmo’s body in their bedroom and called the emergency services, Mr Tweddle heard. Mr Curtis said neighbours were interviewed with one saying he had heard a smash at about 9pm the night before but could not see anything unusual. He said: 'Due to the circumstances, we made a full inquiry into Mr Nimmo’s death but could find nothing suspicious nor anything to suggest a third party had been involved.' Mr Tweddle said toxicology reports had found he had some alcohol and amphetamines in his system but not enough to impair his judgement. He said: 'I do not know what was going on in his mind. 'It might have been to shock them, it might have been that he was expecting them to come home sooner than they did or it might have been that he intended to take his own life.'

"Gadgets, Google and social sites such as Facebook are leading children to mature much faster than in previous generations. The majority of parents in a recent poll admitted they are concerned their children are growing up too quickly, and 77 per cent blamed the web. They attributed this accelerated maturity, in particular, to peer pressure, the vast amount of information they see online, and social networks. Scroll down for video . Parents in a recent poll from London-based security firm Bullguard admitted they are concerned their children are growing up too quickly. More than 2,000 parents with children aged between 8 and 12 were surveyed, and almost 80 per cent blamed smartphones and the vast amounts of information on the web . The polled parents also revealed 70 per cent of their children, aged 12 or under, now search the web unsupervised. The results come from a survey commissioned by security firm BullGuard. More than 2,000 parents with children aged between 8 and 12 were asked questions about their children, and their habits and behaviours. Almost half of the parents said they feel pressured to buy their children the latest gadgets. While 50 per cent let their children use the web unsupervised, and download apps, at the age of 10. On average, half of parents said they would also be comfortable with a child having a Facebook account by the age of 12. Tablets are now more important to children than their TVs, with more than one-third of young people aged five to 15 owning their own device. Around 34 per cent of children in this category own their own tablet, which is up from 19 per cent last year, according to official Ofcom figures. And six in ten children use a tablet at home - a 50 per cent increase on 2013 - while the number of children with televisions in their rooms has fallen by a third in five years. Nedko Ivanov, BullGuard’s chief executive said: ‘Children display different levels of maturity and as a rule you can’t always say every child is ready to do this or that by a certain age. ‘All parents will question whether their children are ready to attend a sleepover or catch a bus, but in today’s digital age the use of different types of technology is also something to consider. The majority of parents who took part in the poll said their children owned a mobile phone, pierced their ears and had a TV in their bedroom at the age of 10. Getting an iPad, choosing their own clothes and making their own breakfast were also luxuries listed that a typical 10 year old can enjoy. But catching a bus alone, being allowed to wear make-up and getting an email account comes at the more mature age of 11, the survey found. ‘Most children will pester their parents and demand the latest gadgets, but it’s important to also take into account whether or not they’re ready for what they might encounter and if they do start using this sort of technology, to make sure they are safe online,’ continued Mr Ivanov. Almost half of the parents questioned said they feel pressured to buy their children the latest gadgets. While 50 per cent let their children use the web unsupervised, and download apps, at the age of 10. On average, half of parents would also be comfortable with a child having a Facebook account by the age of 12, too . The study also revealed that 40 per cent of parents find it annoying that celebrities and friends have more influence over their children than they do. Tony Neate, CEO of Get Safe Online said: ‘Children of today are part of a digital generation, they just do not know any different than to use technology and the internet. ‘However, whilst it may be second nature, it’s important that young people understand the risks and the boundaries they should observe. ‘Part of this is about trust and education. Like learning to ride a bike, or crossing the road, the most effective way to educate children is to start early and empower them to take responsibility for their own safety. ‘For many parents this means educating themselves too so they can feel confident talking to their children about online behaviour and safety.","Parents in a recent poll admitted they are concerned their children are growing up too quickly .

Scroll down for video . 40-Year-Old Virgins: A new British documentary follows Clive as he flies to the U.S. to meet Cheryl Cohen-Greene, a surrogate sexual partner whose work inspired last year's Oscar-nominated film, The Sessions . Sex therapy: The documentary, set to air on Britain's Channel 4 on Thursday, also follows 29-year-old virgin Rosie as she works with her sexual 'surrogate', Gary, 55 . The documentary, set to air at 9pm on Thursday, shows the 'intense bond' that develops between Clive and Ms Cohen-Greene as she helps him to face his fears of intimacy, Channel 4 said. The show - the latest in a string of Channel 4 documentaries to tackle the intimate details of subjects' sex lives - also follows 29-year-old Rosie, who dreams of marriage and children, but can't bear to be touched by men. The Undateables: The name of this dating series for singles with disabilities sparked outrage before the series even aired, with viewers insisting the title was 'offensive' and 'horrible'. Virgin School: The documentary following nervous James, 26, as he spent three months learning the 'art of intimacy' at an Amsterdam sex school, was branded 'juvenile' and 'offensive' by family values campaign group Mediawatch.Tramadol Nights: From offensive comments about Katie Price's disabled son Harvey, to the use of racial slurs in sketches, Scottish comic Frankie Boyle's short-lived Channel 4 comedy series was shrouded in controversy for much of its run.The Joy of Teen Sex: Scenes of lesbian sex and a 'guide to anal sex' were among the controversial material tackled by this factual entertainment series. Channel 4 was accused of taking television to 'new depths of sexual explicitness' by the newspaper Christian Today. Virgin Rosie, who thinks men smell like 'a cross between aftershave and ham', is seen working with her own surrogate partner, 55-year-old Gary, an ex-professional tennis player turned counsellor. Vivienne Patterson, a spokeswoman for Mediawatch, which campaigns for family values in the media, said she worried that the documentary could cross the line from educational programming into voyeurism. 'I haven't seen it yet but I do understand there is a scene in there where he [Clive] goes to see a sex therapist and eventually you see him losing his virginity,' she said. Ms Patterson said that while educational programming was 'fantastic', problems could crop up because of the expectation that shows also be entertaining - particularly given the documentary's 9pm prime-time slot. 'You get this very difficult cross-over,' she said, citing previous Channel 4 shows like The Joy of Teen Sex. The factual entertainment series was . billed as a 'bold and informative' look at the love lives and sex lives . of teenagers, but was branded 'porn' by critics. 'It's legitimate to have a programme . where teens can ask questions about matters sexual... but it became . exploitative,' Ms Patterson said. In 2007 Channel 4 broadcast Virgin .

"Cornered: Hani Nicham Abou El Kheir was knifed 30 times for living on the wrong side of the street . A gang who stabbed and hacked a schoolboy to death with knives, swords and a meat cleaver because he lived on the wrong side of the street was yesterday jailed for a total of 131 years. Hani Hicham Abou El Kheir, 16, died after being knifed 30 times when the hooded gang of up to ten people pounced on him wielding a ‘fearsome armoury’ in a ‘calculated and savage’ attack yards from multi-million pound homes. He was hunted down and shot with a Taser stun gun before being stabbed through the heart and left for dead. Arber Barbatovci, 20, Ahmed Mikhaimar, 20, Tarquai Joseph, 19, and a fourth man, aged 20, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 26 years each. A fifth member of the gang, Craig Boyce, 26, was told he would spend at least 27 years behind bars. The Old Bailey heard that the ‘chilling’ murder, which happened on a Sunday in Pimlico, an affluent area of Central London where Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has a home, was the result of a bitter rivalry between two street gangs in a ‘turf war’ over drugs. Police blamed Hani’s slaughter on ‘the casual acceptance of knives among young people’ in London. But his broken-hearted mother insisted her son had nothing to do with gangs and died simply because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. On January 27 last year, Hani was walking home with his girlfriend through an estate in Pimlico at the centre of the turf war when he was spotted by the gang, who were wearing balaclavas, hats and scarves. Arber Barbatovci (left), 20, and Ahmed Mikhaimar (right), 20, were convicted along with three others for the murder of Hani Hicham Abou El Kheir, 16 . They chased him into an alleyway . where he was ‘butchered’ in such a frenzied ambush that two of the . killers suffered cuts as they rained down blows on the helpless . schoolboy. The mob then scattered and dumped their weapons in a drain. Hani died later in hospital. Prosecutor . Aftab Jafferjee QC said: ‘An agenda of murderous proportion was at play . that evening by way of simply which side of a street they lived on. His . murder was the produce of brazen lawlessness on the streets of Central . London on a Sunday evening.’ Hani’s . mother, Pauline Hickey, said he was a recluse who suffered from anxiety . attacks and had only just started venturing out on his own  and making . friends in the last few weeks of his life. In . a moving statement, she said: ‘Hani was my only child. I pine for him . every day and I cannot come to terms with the fact that I will never . again see his warm, beautiful smile or his awkward walk or hear his . childish voice and explosive laugh, the way he said “Mum” constantly and . told me he loved me every day, the mess he left his bedroom and his . heavy hugs. Craig Boyce (left), 26, and Tarquai Joseph (right), 19, were in the ten-strong gang which killed the victim . ‘Hani was a . gentle and loving giant. Every day I expect him to come through the . front door. I cannot face the truth of Hani’s death and I cannot get . over the devastating image of my son lying dead in the hospital.’ She said she would have given her life to save her son. ‘It . has left me feeling so much guilt for not being there to help him when . he was butchered by that gang as he tried to run home to me,’ she added. ‘Hani was not involved with any gangs and had never been arrested or . involved with the police in any way. ‘It could have been anyone who was murdered that night; Hani was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.’ The court heard that his killers had a catalogue of previous convictions. The . defendant who cannot be named was convicted in 2010 of affray after an . 18-year-old boy was attacked on a bus near Victoria station. Mikhaimar, . of Pimlico, has convictions for burglary, while Barbatovci, also from . Pimlico, has a record that includes affray and possession of a knife. Boyce, of Paddington, West London has committed 23 offences of vandalism . and assault. Horrific: The 16-year-old died from multiple stab wounds after he was set upon on the edge of Pimlico . Grieving: Family members including Hani's mother Pauline Hickey, pictured with her hood up, lay flowers next to the scene where he was stabbed . Joseph, of . Maida Vale, West London, has been convicted of abusing two police . workers, attempted robbery and grievous bodily harm. All five had denied . murder but they were convicted unanimously by a jury. Judge Charles Wide QC, told them: ‘The murder by you of Hani Hicham Abou El Kheir was as calculated as it was savage. ‘The horror of what you did is demonstrated and compounded by the degree of planning and organisation. ‘You . had a fearsome armoury of long knives and meat cleavers and then a . co-ordinated meet after which you moved together through the streets to . find your victim, hunt him down and kill him. He must have been utterly . terrified as he was chased by you and utterly terrified when, . outnumbered, the blows rained down.’ A . sixth man, Yassine Sidi-Ammi, 20, was cleared of perverting the course . of justice, while another man, Dilwar Hussein, has fled to Bangladesh. Donjeta . Gashi, 20, of Kentish Town, North-West London, was found guilty of . perverting the course of justice. She will be sentenced later. Police are offering a £20,000 reward for information about others involved in the murder. Detective . Chief Inspector Neil Attewell said: ‘It is the casual acceptance of . knives amongst young people that has led to the needless loss of yet . another young person in London.’","Hani Hicham Abou El Kheir, 16, died after he was chased and stabbed by a ten-strong gang armed with a 'formidable' array of weapons .

"A Muslim woman who pretended she was raped by her boyfriend, leading to his prolonged torture by a gang, because she thought he would show explicit photos of her to her devout parents has been jailed. Sonia Begum, 21, had complained to her cousin Shahen Ahmed, 21, that the man had sexually assaulted her. Ahmed then rounded up a gang who kidnapped and set fire to the 22-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Jailed: Sonia Begum, pictured outside court, was sentenced to four years for kidnap. Her cousin Shahen Ahmed was given an indeterminate sentence for leading a gang that tortured Begum's boyfriend . The 'extraordinary and determined barrage' of violence included setting fire to the victim’s face, beating him . with a belt and kicking him in the stomach. Begum had claimed that the man was pestering her, . and feared that her strict Muslim parents would disapprove of any . contact between them, partly because he was Hindu, the Old Bailey heard. Judge Wendy Joseph QC told Begum: 'You were a young woman leading a double life, trying to comply with a strict regime imposed by your family while secretly having boyfriends, a Facebook account and phones for personal relationships. 'You knew that the kidnap would lead to other things.' Begum lured him to meet her  in Barking, east London, speaking to him . on one mobile phone while maintaining an open line to her brother . Mohammed Hussain, 20. Ahmed, Hussain and two other men - Mafijur Rahman, 45, and Kasim Uddin, 35 - then kidnapped him. She was jailed for four years for kidnap on Friday, while Ahmed was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection for leading the horrifically violent attack. Judge Joseph told Ahmed: 'Whatever wrong he did could not possibly justify what was done to him. The impact upon him was clearly as devastating as it was to his whole family.' She went on: 'The nature of the punishment was profoundly cruel. You set about physically and mentally hurting (the man) by beating, by fire, by verbal abuse, by fear and by humiliation.' Scales of justice: Five other members of the gang involved in the torture of the 22-year-old man were also jailed at the Old Bailey . During the kidnap, a series of 'truly terrifying' phone calls were made demanding money from his family, in which he could be heard screaming, the court heard. The judge said: 'They were very frightening. There were repeated threats to kill (the man) backed up by the sound of him screaming and crying in fear and pain. They were truly terrifying.' The attackers also repeatedly called him a 'Hindu b******'. Ahmed, of Wapping, east London, was told he must serve at least eight-and-a-half years before he can apply for parole. He admitted kidnap, false imprisonment, blackmail and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Hussain, of Poplar, east London, was jailed for 14 years; Uddin, of Mile End, east London, received 11-and-a-half years; and Rahman was sentenced to six-and-a-half years for their roles in the attack. Noor Miah, 49, of Mile End, east London, whose flat was used for the kidnap and torture, received two years for false imprisonment. He was told: 'You lay on your bed allowing your home to be used for what amounted to torture. 'You are not a violent man but a weak one.'","Sonia Begum, 21, complained to her cousin Shahen Ahmed, 21, that her boyfriend was pestering her .

"Chief constable Steve Finnigan has said police spend the equivalent of only one day a week fighting crime . Police spend the equivalent of only one day a week fighting crime, a chief constable has revealed. Barely a fifth of their time is devoted to what most people assume is the biggest part of the job. Far more is spent on administration, ‘managing risk’ and solving people’s problems, said Steve Finnigan, chief constable of the Lancashire force. Research shows just 17 per cent of what his officers do relates to traditional high volume offences such as burglaries, criminal damage and assaults. The ‘cherished notion’ of policing is at risk as the service is squeezed by a variety of demands and unprecedented cuts, he warned. Official statistics show that the majority of police time is taken up hunting for missing people, dealing with troubled families and domestic disputes and helping offenders with mental health problems. When the force analysed all recorded incidents its officers were dealing with, it found that only 17 per cent were classed as actual crime. Thirty-five per cent related to ‘public safety and welfare’. Anti-social behaviour, ranging from rowdy behaviour to neighbourly disputes, made up 16 per cent, and administrative tasks took up 20 per cent. Transport-related problems such as accidents and disruption on the roads accounted for 10 per cent. Mr Finnigan, head of performance management for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said the effects of financial cuts to the service may be that the more community-related aspects of policing would have to be abandoned. ‘Missing from home...cat up a tree...whatever. We get lots of calls where we give advice and support. Very often we are happy to do that, we are trying really hard to be problem-solvers. ‘We deal with vulnerable adults but often there is no criminal issue and we can pour huge resources into that, tying up officers for hours. ‘We think cuts to the police service are too deep and too quick. We can’t lose all these people and not feel the impact of it. The service is getting squeezed. ‘The cherished notion of police...there is some danger of that being damaged going forward. ‘The danger is going from a proactive model of policing to a reactive model.’ He said far more time is spent on administration, 'managing risk' and solving people's problems . Cuts to local health services and out-of-hours health provision mean officers are often tied up ferrying people to hospital, or waiting hours for a mental health bed to become free, Mr Finnigan said. ‘The culture of the organisation is changing. Seventeen per cent of what we do involves crime, 83 per cent does not. Lots of these areas (in the 83 per cent) have a strong link to crime but there are other areas that are not strictly crime-related. ‘When I look at my own force I see the effect. Every day we manage risk. That’s our job. It’s absolutely not just about cutting crime.’ His comments were reinforced by Tony Lloyd, chairman of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners’ Board, who said cuts could mean police only being able to respond to ‘blue light’ demands, rather than community ones. Mr Lloyd, who is also police commissioner for Greater Manchester, said he had ‘serious reservations’ about cuts to police budgets. ‘The more the numbers go down, and demand goes up, the more the police will end up responding to the blue light demands rather than community demands because they have to.’","Barely a fifth of time is devoted to what most people assume job is .

"BBC children's programmes should include more lesbian, gay and bisexual people, a report of the corporation recommends. A panel of nine experts said youngsters should be introduced to sexual diversity in their early years. While there has been a gradual increased in the representation of these people, they remain 'still relatively invisible' in the media, they said. Exposure: Audiences should see lesbian, gay and bisexual people on television 'during their formative years', the study said . The experts added that the BBC should be 'more creative and bolder in its depiction of such groups of people, taking care to steer clear of stereotypes.' The report concluded: 'The LGB [lesbian, gay and bisexual] experts feel that the BBC should seek to incorporate the portrayal of LGB people within programming targeted at children, to familiarise audiences through incidental portrayal from an early age.' Demonstrating positive experiences and outcomes will stop LGB children feeling isolated, it said, particularly in rural areas. The report commissioned by the broadcaster, which drew on audience surveys and nine 'LGB experts', concluded that all genres of programming should regularly feature non-heterosexual people, with news and drama currently the biggest problem areas. Of BBC News, the study claimed that too much time was given to 'homophobic' viewpoints. 'As a public service broadcaster and a standard bearer on moral issues, the BBC is asked to reconsider the way in which it is perceived to set up these debates with two extreme perspectives and to be more creative and nuanced in its presentation,' wrote Clare Luke of Solitaire Consulting, who produced the report. Role models: Gay actor Andrew Payden-Smith, left, starred in CBBC drama Byker Grove and presented its breakfast shows for children. Former Big Brother Brian Dowling, right, hosted a showbiz slot on BBC Radio 1 . For dramas and soaps, she recommended bolder storylines featuring gay characters, while documentaries were deemed to need more LGB presenters and portrayal of gay people in history. As for comedy, the report concluded that the 'biggest risk' was LGB people being the focus of a joke. This was judged as only truly acceptable when the comedians themselves were gay. The report drew on a survey of around 3,000 viewers, in which one in five heterosexual men said they thought there were too many LGB people on BBC television. More than one in ten people said there were uncomfortable with the portrayal of gay, lesbian and bisexual people in the broadcast media. Acting director general Tim Davie, . chair of the BBC Working Group which commissioned the review, said: 'The . BBC has a fundamental obligation to serve all its audiences. In fact, . it’s one of the BBC’s public purposes to reflect the diversity of UK . life. Stalwart: BBC children's presenter Kirsten O'Brien said in 2007 that 'everyone at CBBC is either gay or childless and don't like kids' 'I’m proud to . have led this work for three years, and this review underlines our . commitment and sets a direction for the work to continue.' Reacting to the report, Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, said: ‘I would object to my children being subjected to any sexualisation on a BBC television programme, whether homosexual or heterosexual. That is not the purpose of children’s TV.’ But Peter Tatchell, a gay rights campaigner for OutRage!, said: ‘This is a really positive proposal which can help increase understanding and combat prejudice. Every child deserves to grow up to be tolerant, kind, and supportive of other people who are gay or lesbian.’Other areas criticised in the report include entertainment and sport, where researchers also believe homosexuals are under-represented on the BBC. In comedy, it is feared homosexuals could become the focus of cruel jokes. ‘However, if the author or source of the humour is LGB, this is felt to be more authentic or appropriate and so there is more acceptance,’ the report said. In entertainment, gay presenters can act as role models, it said, provided they are there ‘because of their talent as opposed to their sexual orientation’. Big Brother star Dowling became the first openly gay children's TV presenter in the UK when he began presenting ITV's SMTV Live in 2002. In 2002, Dowling co-hosted the Elle Style Awards with BBC Radio 1 presenter Jo Whiley and he hosted a showbiz slot on Vernon Kay's BBC Radio 1 Saturday morning show from 2004 to 2006. Gay actor Andrew Hayden-Smith made his name as Ben in CBBC youth drama Byker Grove, and in 2002 became half of the main presenting team for the afternoon slot on BBC1, a position he would  hold for just under four years. During that time, he also occasionally presented the CBBC breakfast shows on BBC1 and BBC2 as well as the digital CBBC channel. Performer John Barrowman, who has since appeared on BBC shows Doctor Who, Torchwood and Strictly Come Dancing, began his career presenting CBBC's Saturday morning show Live and Kicking. Gay rights campaigner Anthony Crank, best known for fronting Channel 4 youth show T4, works for BBC Radio Manchester as a regular cover presenter and presented BBC family shows including Holiday and Holiday Hit Squad. BBC children's presenter Kirsten O'Brien said in 2007 that 'everyone at CBBC is either gay or childless and don't like kids'. However, the corporation insisted that her remarks about her colleagues during a stand-up show at the Edinburgh festival had been made in jest. The SMart presenter's words came shortly after a series of gaffes relating to BBC children's shows. Blue Peter was found to have used a studio guest to pose as a competition winner and presenter Richard Bacon admitted taking cocaine.","Study said gay presenters would 'validate' the feelings of gay children .

"A family of travellers who kept homeless drug addicts and alcoholics as virtual slaves were last night facing years behind bars. The Connors family owned homes with hot tubs; a fleet of cars including a Rolls-Royce and  a Mercedes saloon; enjoyed Caribbean cruises and holidays in Mexico and Dubai; and had £500,000 in the bank. But their fortune came from constructing driveways and patios using a workforce of vulnerable men kept in squalid conditions, paid a pittance, and living in fear of violence. Scroll down for video . Cruelty: Wealthy traveller William Connors, 51, berates one of his labourers at a caravan park . Terrified: The labourers faced the constant threat of being attacked by their 'employers', sometimes with implements including rakes and broom handles . Sick: Connors is caught on CCTV apparently assaulting one of the slaves he was said to pay less than £5 a day . Savage: The work was monotonous, arduous and often humiliating, and they were controlled by discipline and violence . The workers were given alcohol and cannabis but so little food they resorted to scavenging from dustbins for leftovers. Some were effectively forced to work . for the family for 30 years, and many were beaten, hit with broom . handles, belts, a rake and a shovel, and punched and kicked for . displeasing their masters. One worker had a hosepipe shoved down his throat and the men were often made to strip for a ‘hosing down’ with freezing water. Luxury lifestyle: William and Mary (or Breda) Connors, pictured in Dubai, lived the high life while forcing vulnerable people to obey their every command . They told police they were unable to escape because they had too little money to afford train tickets. Called ‘the dossers’ by their masters, those who did try to slip away were usually soon rounded up. Yesterday, a jury unanimously . convicted William ‘Big boss’ Connors, 52, his wife Mary, 48, their sons . John, 29, and James, 20, and their son-in-law Miles Connors, 24, of . conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. There was such screaming and uproar . from relatives in the public gallery at Bristol Crown Court that the . judge ordered security guards to clear the room. Police began investigating the . defendants – most of whom gave home addresses in Staverton, . Gloucestershire, with Miles being listed as from Bradford – following . the discovery of the decomposed body of worker Christopher Nicholls, 40, . in a shed close to a Gloucestershire caravan site in 2008. He had been involved in a serious road . accident four years earlier. And in 2009 one unnamed worker told . detectives he’d had his identity documents taken and was rarely paid and . received little food. The specific offence of which the . family were found guilty came into law only in April 2010, which is why . the charges against them dated between that month and March 2011, when . police raided sites in Staverton, Enderby and Mansfield in . Nottinghamshire, rescuing 19 workers. The family maintained the men were . ‘free agents’, with William and Mary claiming they were ‘good . Samaritans’ providing the homeless with food, work and shelter. In practice the men were often given . just £5 a day for heavy labour and emptying toilet buckets. And violence . was an ever-present threat. Prosecutor Christopher Quinlan QC said . the violence was ‘a clear and unequivocal demonstration of control and . dominance, of one set, the family, over another’. While their team of workers lived . crammed together in just a few squalid caravans, the family had several . other spotless caravans, which appeared unlived in – with toilets even . used for storing wads of cash. Cruel: Son-in-law Miles Connors, left, and William and Mary's sons John and James were all involved in the family racket . William and Mary Connors picked up the drifters and forced them into hard labour for the benefit of the family . Police raid: Bizarrely, the Connors kept money in a toilet at one of their caravans . VIDEO: CCTV footage of traveller William Connors assaulting a worker . The family’s property portfolio is potentially now worth millions of pounds, with holdings including two caravan parks. Police now plan to seize the family’s . assets under the Proceeds of Crime Act legislation. They will also seek . to prevent them from tarmacking and paving drives in the future with a . Serious Crime Prevention Order. Detective Chief Inspector Dave . Sellwood, who led the investigation, said senior detectives were too . appalled by the workers’ conditions to set foot inside their caravans, . adding: ‘I have never seen one group of human beings treat another group . so badly for so long just for their financial benefit.’ The five family members have been remanded in custody to be sentenced on Tuesday. Cramped: Workers were made to live in caravans owned the Connors family, who had purchased several sites . Shocking: The Connors reportedly supplied workers, pictured, with cannabis while depriving them of enough food to keep them subservient . Callous: The slaves travelled around the country working for the Connors family business and living in a corner of one of the family's caravan parks . Keeping up appearances: John Connors with the family's patio company workers at a construction site - but many were being forced into slave labour . Marketing: A flyer advertising the Connors family drive and patio service features a landline telephone number in order to look more professional . William and Mary Connors (pictured below on a cruise) lived the high life while their workers were treated . appallingly, said the detective who led the investigation into the family. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Sellwood, of Gloucestershire Police, said: 'The . Connors caravans were beautiful, they were absolutely pristine, they . were new, without exception, and in absolutely immaculate condition. 'In most cases the cookers had never been used, the toilets had never been used. They lived a very good life.' Police . plan to launch an investigation into the Connors' wealth and to use . Proceeds of Crime Act legislation to seize their assets. 'They are very wealthy,' said Mr Sellwood. '[Billy] has been to Dubai, Cancun and to the USA. This criminal operation is not about getting by and scraping a living. 'I have never seen one group of human beings treat another group so badly for so long just for their financial benefit.' Mr Sellwood said even hardened detectives were shocked by the raids in March last year. 'Having observed accounts from people that got away from them, we understood that they would be living in poor conditions. 'But . actually some of the conditions were far worse. I brought some of my . officers along to see first-hand the conditions that these workers were . living in because I knew I was going to find it was impossible to . describe. 'This was a . group of very experienced senior detectives and none of them were . prepared to set foot inside either of the two caravans and certainly . when I did set foot in them I wasn't prepared to touch any of the . surfaces.' Mr Sellwood added: 'The . evidence that we have heard in court is just a proportion of the . information that is available to the police in terms of the treatment . that the Connors handed out. 'The . two assaults that we did catch on video, one was on a 17-year-old man . with learning difficulties, the other an older gentleman that had been . with them for about 11 years. 'He is currently incapable of living alone and is in supported accommodation and will be for the rest of his life. I think that is an example of the Connors' treatment of very vulnerable men.' Different world: The Connors owned £170,000 caravan park Willowdene, pictured, and Hayden Laurels, which was bought in July 2007 for £390,000 . Luxury cars: The family had a silver A-Class Mercedes saloon, a Rolls Royce, a red Mini convertible, a Toyota Hilux pick up, a Ford Ranger and a Mercedes van . The vulnerable men working for the Connors family were forced to live in squalor, carry out menial tasks and work in hard and often freezing conditions. They were usually homeless, alcoholics or drug addicts and they were used as cheap labour for the Connors’ paving and patio businesses. Oliver was picked up by Miles Connors, William, pictured below centre with labourers at a construction site, and Mary Connors son-in-law, in March 2010 and lived on traveller sites in the Midlands and in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. A recovering alcoholic, he did not want to reveal his full identity, but told ITV West: 'They were keeping us rock bottom and giving us just enough to survive on, supplying us with alcohol, supplying us with cannabis. 'Not eating enough, the coldness, the emptying of the slop buckets for them... they never did anything for themselves - it was horrible. 'It was a low point for me, but when I first met the man he promised me that he could help.' Oliver’s work was monotonous and unrelenting and he was often controlled by violence. 'I did actually witness one of them hitting somebody with a shovel,' he said. 'Maybe he said something wrong to him, maybe he was complaining - that was the treatment you got if you complained.' When asked why he and the other workers did not leave, he maintained 'it was a lot harder to do than that'. Some men who left were rounded up and brought back. 'I did actually escape myself once, but it is hard to do,' said Oliver, who is in his 40s. 'You don’t have any money, you can’t go to the train station and get a train ticket - you have no money to do anything like that - so the only thing you know is best go back.' Oliver was rescued with four other workers when police raided a traveller site at Kirk Lane, Enderby, Leicestershire, on March 22 last year and arrested Miles Connors. 'Slowly but surely it is leaving my head, it is always going to be there, but I’m starting to live back in a normal life again,' he said.

"Former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Stephen Hester received a £1million payout from the bailed-out bank earlier this year . Former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Stephen Hester faces a fresh political row over his pay after it emerged he received a £1million payout from the bailed-out bank earlier this year. The news came just days after the bank was fined £400 million for rigging foreign exchange markets between 2008 and 2013 – the period during which he was at the helm. The pay committee at RBS, which is 79 per cent owned by the Treasury, approved an award of around 250,000 shares in the bank in March as part of a long-term incentive plan. Although part of an existing scheme, it could have withheld the shares. RBS was one of five banks fined by the Financial Conduct Authority and US regulators after it was found a network of traders had colluded to manipulate currency markets. RBS and Hester are no strangers to political rows over pay. Earlier this year Chancellor George Osborne was forced to prevent the bank from paying its top bankers bonuses worth twice their salary, while in 2012 Hester was forced to give up a £963,000 bonus. Hester, whose mansion in Oxfordshire is thought to be worth more than £7 million, was ousted from his role in June 2013. He now runs insurance giant RSA, owners of MoreThan. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘The banks have paid large fines, but people are fed up with the fact that the bankers who have caused so much damage to our economy through their reckless behaviour can break the law and get away scot-free. 'As well as the new management taking back the bonuses of those responsible, prosecutors must look hard at whether criminal action against former senior managers and directors can also be obtained, so wrongdoers can be brought to justice.’ There is no suggestion that Hester was aware of any wrongdoing until official investigations began. Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Chris Leslie, said: ‘It will take a lot to convince me this scale of awards is truly justified. The pay committee at RBS, which is 79 per cent owned by the Treasury, approved an award of around 250,000 shares . ‘If we have moved to long-term bonuses that can be clawed back then that has to bite if we discover misbehaviour.’ Mark Garnier, Conservative MP for Wyre Forest and a member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said: ‘We have to make these people get it that they are responsible for these organisations. 'They are in a position to set in place mechanisms and reporting lines that means if they can’t know every single transaction, they can make sure things have been done properly.’ It was unclear last night if the Chancellor was informed by RBS that it had made the award. RBS and Hester both declined to comment.","Former RBS executive Stephen Hester received £1million payout from bank .

"A woman has been banned from keeping pets for 15 years after her cats were found in what RSPCA inspectors called 'the worst conditions they had seen'. Janet Latheron, 60, from Atherton, near Wigan, kept her six cats in squalor, locked into a prison-like shed fitted with chicken wire dubbed Al-cat-traz by her neighbours. Latheron, who lives alone, fed the cats which she had had since they were kittens, on chips and onion gravy which she bought from her local fish and chip shop with her disability payments. Filthy conditions: The terrified cats lived locked in a prison-like shed in Janet Latheron's garden in Atherton . Al-cat-traz: The cats lived surrounded by chicken wire and inch-deep in their own filth in Latheron's shed . Janet Latheron, 60, kept the cats locked in a filthy shed behind her terraced house in Atherton, near Wigan . When RSPCA inspectors raided her home after a tip-off, they found every surface of the shed including the window-sills caked in faeces, maggots and dead flies, while the cats huddled together on a fithy table. And when they tried to pick up the cats, the animals were so frightened of being handled by humans that they tried to scratch their rescuers. All had multiple chronic infections and are now in an RSPCA safehouse where they are recovering. It is feared the cats may have been kept inside the shed for up to three years in what the animal welfare organisation called ‘some of the worst conditions they have ever seen.’ Details of the case emerged at Wigan Magistrates' Court, where prosecutor, Tony Stock, said: 'Initially the RSPCA had difficulty accessing the property or ramshackle shed in which the cats were housed. 'After a number of hours, and with assistance from the police, they entered the shed and the inspector was shocked by the conditions they found, stating they were ""Some of the worst conditions they had seen cats kept in"". 'The inspector could not stay very long inside as conditions were so bad. 'The vet who examined the cats said that he could not remember a single animal suffering from so many infections at the same time in all his 30 years as a vet,' Mr Stock added: 'The vet noted that by nature cats are clean and meticulous animals and these cats were found living, breathing and walking in their own dirt. 'This has led to mental suffering in which they were frightened and confused.' Stench: One RSPCA inspector said the smell was so bad, she couldn't stay in the shed longer than 10 minutes . Maggots: This photograph shows the extent of the filth in which the six cats were forced to live . 'Chips and onion gravy, their food, remained on the floor. The handover was only achieved with some difficulty because the cats were clearly not used to being handled. All six cats were found to be frightened. Latheron, who later denied she had kept her cats in such an unsanitary environment, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to six cats. In addition to the 15-year ban on keeping animals, which means Latheron will lose her pet bearded dragon which she kept inside her house, she was also given a curfew from 8pm until 7am for 16 weeks. She was also ordered to pay costs of £500 and a victim surcharge of £60, and will not be able to appeal the ban on keeping all animals for 10 years.

Her lawyer, Bob Toppin, said: 'The defendant has swollen ankles and a bad hip and her mobility problems contributed to what happened. 'She has been in floods of tears and these are serious matters. She is a lady who is ashamed to find herself in court at this time in her life.' But RSPCA Inspector Vicki McDonald, who attended the scene, said: 'I hope never to see animals kept in such appalling conditions again. I couldn’t stay in that shed for more than 10 minutes because the smell was so bad.' She added: 'I am particularly pleased with the ban which will prevent the situation happening again and it goes to show keeping animals like this will not be tolerated and will be taken seriously by the courts.'","Janet Latheron, 60, kept her six cats in a locked shed in her back garden .

"Twitter has agreed to hand over the details of people who post racist and anti-Semitic abuse anonymously on the micro-blogging site, it emerged today. Following a long legal battle, the US-based company said it would cooperate with authorities in France who want to bring alleged criminals to justice. The breakthrough is a significant test case for the millions who use social media to express hatred and anger without revealing their identities. The vast majority of Twitter users will not be affected by the ruling. Picture posed by model . Prosecutors in Paris argued that Twitter had a duty to expose wrong-doers, despite its insistence that people had a right to anonymity. In October 2012, Jewish student bodies asked Twitter to remove a number of messages which appeared under the hashtag #unbonjuif (#agoodjew), with some users posting examples such as: ‘#agoodjew is a dead Jew.’ France has a number of strict laws aimed at combating hate crimes. The Union of Jewish Students of France (UEJF) and three other similar groups took Twitter to court asking them to hand over the names of all those responsible so they can be prosecuted. 'Because it does not take the necessary measures to identify where the tweets come from, Twitter is offering a platform to racism and anti-Semitism,' said Jonathan Hayoun, the UEJF president. Stephane Lilti, counsel for the Jewish complainants, suggested Twitter had a ‘commercial interest’ in protecting the anonymity of its users. ‘Twitter is playing a commercial game by raising a number of legal hurdles to not having to comply with its legal obligations,’ he told the court. Following a long legal battle, the US-based company said it would cooperate with authorities in France who want to bring alleged criminals to justice . But Twitter lawyer Alexandre Neri originally argued that the company was only subject to US law and only a judge in America could force it to release the information. Mr Neri told the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris that Twitter ‘data is collected and stored in the United States’ – namely in San Francisco, where the site is based. ‘Should I submit myself to the law of a different country to where I work?' he asked. He added that the differences between French and US laws on freedom of speech have created a ‘huge void, a question mark’. But AFP, France’s national news agency, today confirmed that Twitter had agreed to cooperate with the judgement, and would hand over the coordinates of those responsible for the tweets. A Twitter spokesman said: 'Further to discussions between the parties and in response to a validlegal request, Twitter has provided the prosecutor of Paris, Presse et Libertés Publiques section of the Paris Tribunal de Grande Instance, with data that may enable the identification of certain users that the Vice-Prosecutor believes have violated French law. 'This disclosure puts an end to the dispute between the parties, which have agreed to actively continue contributing together to the fight against racism and anti-Semitism, in keeping with their respective domestic laws and regulations, such as by taking measures to improve the accessibility of the reporting procedure of illegal tweets.' Last year Twitter shut down an account run by a German neo-Nazi group based in Hanover, following a request by German police. Facebook and YouTube complied with similar requests.","Millions use social media to express hatred without revealing identities .

"Violence is a bigger threat to the health of European women than cancer, according to Bianca Jagger, the campaigner and first wife of rock star Mick. While her former husband was playing with The Rolling Stones in London’s Hyde Park, Miss Jagger, 68, gave an impassioned speech calling on world leaders to prevent physical and sexual assaults. ‘The stark reality is women and girls are still a vulnerable group. Legend: Council of Europe Goodwill Ambassador and former actress Bianca Jagger . 'We face unconscionable levels of discrimination and violence,’ she told an audience in Berlin, which included actress Nicole Kidman, a goodwill ambassador to the UN. ‘Across Europe, violence is a bigger danger to women than cancer, with 45 per cent of women experiencing some kind of physical or sexual violence.’ According to the UN, up to  six in ten women around the world experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. In South Africa, one is killed every six hours by her partner. In Guatemala, two are murdered, on average, each day. Celebrity for a cause: Nicole Kidman and Deputy Executive Director of U.N. Women Lakshmi Puri on the red carpet for the Cinema For Peace event in Berlin on Friday . Star power: The actress is a current Goodwill Ambassador for the UN . However, the developed world is not exempt, Miss Jagger said. ‘Last year in the UK, 60,000 women were raped, over 400,000 were sexually assaulted and 1.2 million suffered domestic abuse, according to the Home Office,’ she added. Yet despite this, she pointed out, there were only 5,651 rape prosecutions and 111,891 for domestic violence in England and Wales. ‘Failure of governments to protect the rights of women continues to hinder gender equality all over the world. 'It is a grave injustice which holds us back as a society,’ she said.","Bianca Jagger said 45 per cent of women experience some kind of violence .

"It invested £126,000 in an empty room with lights that flicked on and off every five seconds and paid £22,350 for a sealed tin said to contain an artist's excrement. But a pile of 6,000 oranges dubbed Soul City (Pyramid of Oranges) is tipped to be the Tate Modern's craziest art installation yet. The taxpayer-backed London art gallery has spent £30,000 on the sculpture - which works out to be a fiver for each fruit. South African born artist Roelof Louw sits beside his sculpture 'Soul City (Pyramid of Oranges)', which has been bought by the Tate Modern for £30,000 . Visitors to the exhibition, first created by South African-born Roelof Louw in 1967, will be encouraged to eat the display. But this works out as quite an expensive snack, as the fruit can be sold for as little as 8p each at a market. Charles Thompson, of traditional art group Stuckists, said the gallery 'has a history of buying dross'. He told The Sun: 'Now it is paying way over the top for something you can get at a supermarket.' Visitors to the exhibition, first created in 1967, will be encouraged to eat the display, which works out at £5 per orange . Tracey Emin’s controversial installation My Bed was shown at Tate Britain in the exhibition for the 1999 Turner Prize, for which Emin was shortlisted . Greengrocer Andreas Georghiou, of Chelsea, said: 'I'd love someone to walk in my shop and spend £30,000 on oranges.' A Tate spokesman said the money had come from rich patrons and insisted Louw was ""a significant figure in the context of sculptural experiment."" The work was created to raise questions about ephemerality, time and decay. The gallery paid £22,350 for a sealed tin said to contain the excrement of artist Piero Manzoni . Visitors are invited to take an orange and as a result the piece literally dematerialises and changes through visitor participation. It first appeared at the Arts Laboratory, London in October 1967 and has featured prominently in recent exhibitions surveying the period since its ‘rediscovery’ by Clive Phillpott in 2000. The Tate has a history of investing in unusual installations, such as Work 227: The lights going on and off. It was awarded the Turner Prize, but several visitors walked out, saying the exhibit was unfit to be considered for the most celebrated prize in the art world. More than £22,000 was also given for a sealed tin said to contain the excrement of artist Piero Manzoni. He produced 90 cans when he was living in Milan in 1961 and his decision to value his waste on a par with the price of gold was said to reference the  tradition of the artist as an alchemist. Tracey Emin’s controversial installation My Bed has also been exhibited at the famous gallery. It was shown at Tate Britain in the exhibition for the 1999 Turner Prize, for which Emin was shortlisted.

"The alleged patriarch at the centre of a shocking incest scandal that spans four generations has arrived back in Australia after fleeing the country. Charlie Colt, 41, was intercepted by NSW police investigators after being alerted by the Department of Immigration  that he had returned to the country from the UK, reports the Daily Telegraph. Colt has been accused of fathering three of the children in the infamous Colt family, where it is alleged that 40 adults and children were engaging in incestuous relationships on a squalid bush block in rural NSW. Charlie Colt is also accused of engaging in regular sexual intercourse with his sister and having sexual relationships with other children in the family. Alleged incest matriarch Betty Colt, accused of sleeping with her brother, outside court . Betty Colt, considered the Colt family leader, was jailed earlier this month over a plot to kidnap two of her children from their foster parents . The shocking case made news around the world, and has been labeled as one of the most depraved example of inter-family relationship on record. Mr Colt, labelled under a pseudonym by the order of the court, fled to England in June, after going on the run from police and hiding in Albury-Wodonga, on the NSW and Victorian border, and Adelaide, where a warrant was issued for his arrest. He denies all allegations against himself and his family, but failed to appear at his scheduled court date in June, when police had hoped to successfully apply to use a DNA sample to prove he had been engaging in incest. 'I’ve never abused a child in my life, I’ve never abused another person,' Charlie Colt told The Daily Telegraph. 'I love my whole family dearly, but not sexually. I think it’s absolutely disgusting, it’s wrong, it’s against everything we were brought up with.' Mr Colt claimed that the 'rumours' were started by a neighbour who was rebuffed by his sister, accused incest matriarch Betty Colt. 'She told him straight out no and then he turned around and said ‘I suppose you’re f ... ing your brothers aren’t you’. 'He was in the pub spreading it every night,' he said. Daily Mail Australia contacted the head of the NSW Child Abuse Squad, Peter Yeoman, to confirm whether Charlie Colt had arrived back in the country but he was unavailable to comment. The scandal was revealed by a schoolyard conversation involving one of the children living in incest compound who attended a local school. The family were engaging in interfamilial sexual relations between siblings, parents, grandparents and grandchildren. A man believed to be at the centre of the family, Charlie Colt, has arrived back in Australia after evading police . The camp where the Colt family lived, whose story made news around the world and is regarded as Australia's most depraved example of incest and child abuse . The Department of Family and Community Services raided the Colt's property back in 2012, after a schoolyard conversation involving one of the children living in the hills who did attend school . Betty Colt, considered the Colt family leader, was jailed earlier this month over a plot to kidnap two of her children from their foster parents . The Department of Family and Community Services raided the Colt's property in 2012. The scandal was revealed by a schoolyard conversation involving one of the children living in incest compound who attended a local school. One of the Colt family children was overheard saying at the school: 'My sister is pregnant and we don't know which of my brothers is the father'. The police and welfare officers were confronted at the circumstances of those living on the property when they raided the property in the southwest of NSW. They found the 40 adults and children living in two filthy caravans, two sheds and tents without plumbing. The family were engaging in interfamilial sexual relations between siblings, parents, grandparents and grandchildren. The property was in a state of squalor, with no toilets, showers or baths. The children were unwashed, wore dirty clothes and almost all had fungal infections on their feet. Dirt caked the surfaces of stoves and cooking facilities, rotten vegetables lay in a refrigerator and a kangaroo was sleeping on one of the children's beds. As well as the appalling conditions of the residence, the children had facial deformities, could not speak intelligibly, and did not know what a toothbrush or toilet paper were. They were shy and made little eye contact, and the welfare officers learned that few were capable of intelligible speech. The family groups on the property comprised of sisters, Rhonda, 47, Martha, 33, and Betty Colt, 46, who slept every night with her brother, Charlie, and two of Betty's daughters who each had children who proved to be from unions of related parents. Peter Yeoman's, the longstanding boss of the NSW child abuse Squad, said he had never seen anything akin to the generational incest involved the Colt case . Betty Colt-believed to be the matriarch of the group-was jailed earlier this month for a plot to kidnap her children from their carers. Bobby Colt, one of her sons, said his mother gave him a phone to hide in the back garden of his foster home in an attempt to kidnap him and his brother. Ms Colt fronted all of her court appearances at Parramatta and at Moss Vale in the NSW Southern Highlands, dressed smartly in a succession of crisp grey or black suits. Her lawyer, Phil Carey, revealed that Ms Colt was funded only by a Newstart allowance. However, court documents found that following the removal of five of her children by authorities, Ms Colt  was struggling financially. The investigations are ongoing. Earlier this month, after incest matriarch Betty Colt was jailed for attempted to kidnap her sons from the foster homes and put them to work as fruitpickers, court documents were released detailing the relationship between Colt and her 15-year-old son, Bobby . May 31, 2013, 6.33pm . Betty tells Bobby his voice sounds 'so sexy' on the phone. She says she intends to fight to get him and his brother Billy back out of care and she hopes the 'c****' are listening. She says when she gets him out after he turns 16 he can get his own place if he wants. He tells her 'the cops' had talked to him about raping a girl at school. Betty tells him: 'They have nothing'. She puts on Bobbby's aunt Rhonda, who tells him: 'Your voice got deeper'. Then Betty tells Bobby again that she likes his voice and '... ohhh, you can say it alright'. August 8, 2013 . 9.05pm to 11.09 pm - 15 texts between mother and son. 9.25pm Bobby to Betty: Love you. 9.36pm Bobby to Betty: Love all. 9.56pm Bobby to Betty: Love all. 10.09pm Betty to Bobby: Bobby xoxoxoxoxo. September 6, 2013 . Betty tells Bobby the court case is getting her down, saying: 'I'm meant to have raped you all. 'They reckon I've had sex with you boys even [she names her youngest son and nephew]. Everyone. Bobby: 'I think we're a bit young for that.' Betty: 'Sick f****. I'm meant to have put all the girls in a tent and told all you boys who to have sex with. ' Bobby: 'Have they got any proof?' Betty: 'Well it never happened, so they don't have shit ... they're trying to say that my dad is your dad, not that my dad is your grandad. 'They just want me to get prison time. I've done nothing f****** wrong.' Bobby: 'All you have done is try to help people. ' Betty: 'That's f****** right. They think I slept with [brother's name] and my dad and they are fathers of my kids.' Bobby: 'You can have them locked up for making stories.' September 17, 2013, 6.32pm . Betty: 'How ya been gorgeous.' Bobby: 'Yeah alright.' Betty: 'What ya been up to ... you only got a couple of weeks until you're 16, then you can walk out of there.' Bobby: '...it doesn't feel right leaving when I'm 16, leaving the others behind.' Betty: '...you pack your bags. We found out DOCS can't intervene if you just walk out. They can't f****** stop yas.' Two days later, Bobby tells his mother 'they found out who my father is'. She objects and says ,'no they don't ... your father was Tom Wilson. Don't talk to anyone.' When two of Betty's daughters appear to have confessed to welfare authorities the true nature of sexual relations in the incest camp, she is contemptuous and unforgiving. She puts another daughter on to talk about the traitor,Tammy. Bobby responds, 'She's not one of our family no more ... she's a stupid b****'. On September 29, 2013 . As police are closing in on Ms Colt's kidnap plot as the allotted date draws near for her to be reunited with Bobby, she texts him: 'Love you big boy, love you very very much.' Four days later Betty Colt was arrested in a car park on the NSW South Coast and charged.
