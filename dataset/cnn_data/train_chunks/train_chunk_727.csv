Politicians of all parties have voted Margaret Thatcher the most successful prime minister since the Second World War. The Iron Lady was valued for her decisiveness, with most MPs citing this as a more important trait than principles, honesty or intelligence. Mrs Thatcher, who spent 11 years at No10,  beat Labour’s Clement Attlee, who oversaw the creation of the NHS. Politicians of all parties have voted Margaret Thatcher the most successful prime minister since the Second World War . Dr Nicholas Allen, senior lecturer in politics at Royal Holloway, University of London, said: ‘The Iron Lady remain divisive, idolised by some, condemned by others.’ Tony Blair came third in the poll of 158 MPs by the university’s politics department. Winston Churchill came fourth when judged on his second term from 1951 to 1955. And Tony Blair came third in poll of 158 MPs by University of London . Of the 13 post-war PMs, excluding David Cameron, Gordon Brown came last . Of the MPs who took part, 69 were Tories, 67 Labour, 14 Lib Dem and eight from other parties. Of the 13 post-war PMs, excluding David  Cameron, Gordon Brown came last. Party affiliation was generally the strongest predictor of a leader’s success. The exception to the rule was Edward Heath, the Conservative PM who took Britain into Europe.Heath was unseated by Thatcher as party leader in 1975 and was rated more highly by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs than by Conservatives. Dr Allen added: 'It’s not surprising that MPs perceive Thatcher, Attlee and Blair to be the most successful prime ministers. 'Attlee and Thatcher both presided over fundamental shifts in British politics, while Blair, like Thatcher, was a proven election winner. 'When it comes to winning big majorities, David Cameron still has much to prove.'","Iron Lady valued for decisiveness, over traits such as honesty .

A woman has spoken of her horror at being left disfigured and in need of reconstructive surgery after her nose collapsed following a botched operation at a clinic offering half-price discounts. Rita Nugent was one of many women left with severe injuries and serious pain after being treated by  cosmetic surgeon Dr Olufemi Adeyinka Adeogba, who had trained and qualified abroad. Six months after undergoing the Â£2,200 operation, the 31 year-old's nasal passage completely collapsed. A tribunal branded Dr Adeogba's practise 'deplorable', striking him off the medical register after ruling that he 'presents a risk to patients'. Rita Nugent was one of a number of women left in pain and with severe injuries after being treated by Dr Olufemi Adeyinka Adeogba at the private Birkdale Clinic in Crosby in 2011 . One woman was left with a dent in her breast and a nipple that was too high. When she begged Dr Adeogba for help, he told her to wear a supportive bra. Another patient's nipple turned black after he failed to warn her of the dangers of tissue necrosis, if she continued her 12-a-day smoking habit after her operation. Dr Adeogba was employed at the private Birkdale Clinic in Crosby until 2011. Chairman of the tribunal panel, Dr Malcolm Phillips said: 'Dr Adeogba's standards fell below or seriously below those to be expected of a competent cosmetic surgeon. 'The failings were wide-ranging and occurred over a two-year period.' Women rushed to sign up for cosmetic surgery at the clinic, attracted by half-price discounts. Weeks after her operation Ms Nugent's nose caved in. The 31-year-old was led to believe she would need fillers for the rest of her life, until she was told her GP could refer her for reconstructive surgery . A medical tribunal found Dr Adeogba's actions were 'deplorable' and that he posed a 'risk to patients'. He was struck off the medical register . Among those was Ms Nugent, a mother. She said things started going 'badly wrong' almost immediately after surgery, and by the time her wounds healed six months later, her nose had caved in. Ms Nugent said: 'It was like something from a horror movie. 'I asked to speak to the surgeon to ask what happened but I was told by a nurse he wasn't available. Chair of the tribunal Dr Philips, said: 'Dr Adeogba's failings placed patients at risk of harm; some did suffer direct harm as a result of his lack of care' 'I had stitches all over the septum in the middle of my nose. I was in severe pain. I had a terrible taste in the back of my mouth and I was generally unwell. 'The surgeon persuaded me I had to give it more time to heal. 'But he still didn't explain why the tip of my nose had been so damaged.' Ms Nugent believed her only option to repair the damage was to return every two to three weeks for a year to have fillers injected into her nose. She said: 'My nose still looked like a mess. It was only after I was told I could get it fixed on the NHS if I had a referral from my GP that I finally had reconstructive surgery.' The MPTS panel heard how Dr Adeogba, who passed his exams in Germany in 1979, repeatedly failed to take adequate medical histories of patients and failed to give full information on the dangers of surgery. Erasing Dr Adeogba from the medical register, the tribunal branded his conduct 'deplorable' and said he 'continues to present a risk to patients'. Dr Phillips said: 'The panel has evidence before it from the patients' witness statements where Dr Adeogba's attitude towards them is described as ""arrogant"" and not willing to listen. 'Dr Adeogba's failings placed patients at risk of harm; some did suffer direct harm as a result of his lack of care.' The Birkdale Clinic, based in Park Road, was taken over by new management more than a year ago and renamed itself The New Birkdale Clinic. A spokesman for the company said it had no links with its predecessor. The firm's website states: 'During the past year the previous company had a complete change of staff dealing with cosmetic surgery customers at the Birkdale Clinic Liverpool.'","Six months after her Â£2,200 operation, Rita Nugent's nasal passage caved in .

Ed Miliband was branded out of touch last night after Labour unveiled its latest crusade over the ‘cost of living’ crisis – the price of a gym membership. Shadow Public Health Minister Luciana Berger complained that two-thirds of local authority gyms and leisure centres have increased the cost of an annual membership in the last three years – by up to £100. Labour blamed the Prime Minister, declaring: ‘Since 2010, David Cameron has made severe cuts to local government, leaving council services struggling for money.’ Out of touch: Labour leader Ed Miliband was branded out of touch after shadow Public Health Minister Luciana Berger revealed the party's latest crusade - a vow to cut the cost of annual gym memberships . But Tories hit back, saying that gym membership is hardly the most pressing issue for those in economic hardship and suggested that anyone can exercise for free by going jogging. Labour claimed that the rocketing membership costs at local authority-owned leisure centres meant that New Year's resolutions would be harder to keep. A survey of 95 English councils found a yearly pass now costs £368 on average, an increase of £15 since 2010 - but 48 councils introduced above-average hikes. Single classes after work on weekday evenings have risen in price at almost every local authority centre and now average £5.95 per visit, Labour found. The highest increase in annual membership costs - £98 - was introduced by Southampton City Council, followed by a £91.50 hike by Wealden District Council and £80.50 by Hastings Borough Council.

Miss Berger said: 'Millions of people across the country will want to kick-start 2014 by getting fitter and more active. 'There is a real risk, however, that many people will be put off from keeping to their new year's resolutions by soaring gym charges and David Cameron's failure to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. Tory MP Douglas Carswell . 'With worrying obesity levels and stagnating physical activity levels, we desperately need ministers to make gym and leisure facilities accessible and affordable for all.' But Douglas Carswell, MP for Clacton, suggested the issue is more likely to concern people in the leafy corners of North London where Mr Miliband lives and Miss Berger grew up. He said it was ‘not the number one concern of my constituents in Essex’, adding: ‘What are Labour going to be fretting about next? The cost of quinoa, polenta and sundried tomatoes?’ ‘It’s the costs of refuelling cars and heating homes that they should be focused on not how much it costs the metropolitan elite to keep fit. Another Tory source said: ‘This is a bit desperate even by Labour’s standards. To suggest that you have to join a gym to get into shape is ridiculous.

For the 250,000 people who lined London's streets to celebrate the New Year, the resolution at the top of their list for 2014 should be to put litter in bins. A quarter of a million people packed the banks of the River Thames on Tuesday night to enjoy what was billed as the 'world's first multi-sensory fireworks display'. But as soon as the pyrotechnic spectacular was over and the crowds began to head for home, a mammoth clean-up operation was launched. Mess: Operation Clean Up was launched in the early hours of New Years Day after more than 250,000 people packed the streets of London to watch the fireworks . Piled high: Council workers faced mountains of rubbish across central London. An estimated 85 tonnes of waste was collected, including 15,000 champagne bottles . Clean team: The council said 119 members of staff were deployed in central London to tackle the mountains of rubbish left by the crowds . Wreckage: Rubbish was strewn across the pavement and main road along London's Embankment, after people waited for hours to get the prime viewing spot opposite the London Eye . Teams of refuse workers moved in to return London to its best ahead of the New Year's Day parade. Westminster Council deployed 52 vehicles and 119 members of staff throughout the night's festivities to ensure the streets were cleared in time for the annual pageant, which started at noon. But they were faced with mountains of rubbish with the crowds creating an estimated 85 tonnes of waste, including around 15,000 champagne bottles discarded in central London. Nearly 100 people were arrested as an estimated quarter of a million people lined the banks of the River Thames as the chimes of Big Ben rang in 2014. Elsewhere revellers committed a litany of typical night-out offences. The Metropolitan Police said officers arrested 39 people for drunk and disorderly behaviour, 21 for assault, 16 for affray, six for drug related offences, six for public order offences and four others.

'Officers worked . hard, alongside stewards, to keep people safe during the event and . ensure that everyone who came into central London was able to make their . way home at the end of the night. 'Crowds were good natured and there were no major issues reported to police.' Working through the night: Fifty-nine refuse lorries were sent out on to the streets to aid the clean-up mission . The teams faced a race against the clock to get the streets clear in time for the start of the annual New Year's Day pageant, which began at noon . An arduous task: The scale of the job is clear as rubbish stretches as far as the eye can see . Lone sweeper: One worker tackles a vast stretch of road as the last of the revellers head home after a night of celebrating . Never ending: Teams make in roads into the rubbish left all over the pavement. But their job is only half done as one moves on to tackle the waste left in the middle of the main road . A messy night: For the refuse teams in London, New Year's Eve proved to be a long night's work . Events attracted party-goers across the country with 80,000 descending on Edinburgh for its famous Hogmanay street party and firework displays in Cardiff and Belfast. Thousands of revellers in London braved the threat of rain to enjoy the spectacular fireworks display, when peach snow and orange-scented bubbles descended on a section of the crowd. London mayor Boris Johnson said there was 'no better way to celebrate the highs of 2013 and the start of an exciting new year' than enjoying 'one of the world's most dazzling fireworks displays'.

Keir Starmer has urged residents along the route of HS2 to use the Human Rights Act to claim more compensation . Labour’s new golden boy Keir Starmer has waded into the row over the HS2 rail link by claiming it breaches the European Convention on Human Rights. The former Director of Public Prosecutions, claims homeowners hit by the £50 billion project have not been offered proper compensation – and urged them to use human rights laws to get more. The move has fuelled rumours that Mr Starmer is being lined up to replace former Labour Cabinet Minister Frank Dobson as an MP. Just two days ago, Mr Starmer was named Ed Miliband’s adviser on crime victims’ legal rights. Mr Dobson, 73, is expected to retire from Parliament at the next Election. His Holborn and St Pancras seat includes Euston station, where HS2 will terminate, and residents fear they stand to lose a fortune. Labour is already split over the rail link. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls wanted to ditch the party’s support for it but was overruled by Mr Miliband after Labour council leaders in the North said it was vital to the economy. It was claimed Mr Starmer’s call could add ‘hundreds of millions’ to the Government’s HS2 bill. Owners of properties affected have already started receiving ‘exceptional hardship’ payments, with a total of £58 million paid out in 131 cases, even though major work will not start until 2017. But Mr Starmer says that a bigger compensation scheme, due to be launched in the summer, contains a ‘fundamental’ flaw. In advice prepared for residents in Mr . Dobson’s constituency, Mr Starmer said locals ‘will suffer substantial . loss’ and yet no ‘robust’ assessment of the potential losses had been . planned. Following his remarks rumours have started that Starmer is lining himself up for the Labour seat of Holborn and St Pancras which contains Euston station (pictured), where the line will end . He said those affected do not have a proper say – in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Department for Transport rejected Mr Starmer’s claim, adding that it had already gone ‘above and beyond’ what was required in compensation. Asked if he hoped to take Mr Dobson’s seat, a spokeswoman for Mr Starmer said he was ‘considering his options’.","Starmer urges residents to use Human Rights Act to claim compensation .

'Deliberate inflation': Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said the so-called Big Six paid £4billion more for power than the market rate . Energy firms ‘deliberately inflated’ the price they paid for electricity from their own power stations - leaving customers out of pocket by up to £150 over the last three years, it was claimed today. The so-called Big Six - British Gas, SSE, E.ON, EDF, npower, and Scottish Power - paid £4billion more for power than the market rate, according to shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint. The Labour politician accused the companies of paying over the odds to increase profits in other divisions of their companies or doing deals that were bad for customers. She told The Guardian: ‘These figures reveal the full extent of the way consumers have been overcharged for their electricity. ‘Energy companies always blame wholesale costs when they put up bills, but it now looks like they could have deliberately inflated prices to boost profits from their power stations. ‘The time has come for a complete overhaul of our energy market. Labour will break up the big energy companies, put an end to the secret deals and force them to do all of their trading on the open market.’ Labour's analysis compared the price paid for electricity by the energy giants, the weighted average cost of fuel, with the average market price a year ahead provided to them by small supplier First Utility. But Energy UK, which represents the big six suppliers, told The Guardian that Labour's research was wrong because the figures could not be compared. A spokesman said: ‘It also covers losses, the energy element of reconciliation-by-difference (RBD) costs and balancing and shaping costs incurred by the supply. ‘The additional costs included in the weighted average cost of fuel make them a totally different figure to the basic wholesale market price.' Ofgem, the government's watchdog for the energy industry, said today they were 'looking into' the accusations, but said the energy markets were so so difficult to analyse that they could not know for sue. Ian Marlee, a senior partner at the organisation, told the Today programme: 'What we identified in our recent work was that actually there isn’t enough transparency to be able to actually look at that.' However, he added that planned reforms to the industry would help eliminate any problems by increasing competition and removing the possibility for such loopholes. He said: 'We’ve effectively created more transparency... [before the reforms] there wasn't enough trading going on at the point at which people wanted to buy energy. 'We’re making it far easier for independent suppliers to buy the electricity they need to compete with the big six.' The accusation from Labour comes as Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey called for Britain to be part of a fully integrated European power market to bring bills down. The Liberal Democrat dismissed Labour's plans for a price freeze and insisted a giant network of underground and under-sea cables allowing energy to be shifted between the UK and mainland Europe would push down prices. He said there was an urgent need to build a giant network of electricity interconnectors across Europe, allowing vast amounts of energy to be moved between countries, driving down prices - shaving a possible 10 per cent off bills. Urgent need: Energy Secretary Ed Davey has called for Britain to be part of a fully integrated European power market to bring bills down . Mr Davey told The Independent: ‘Literally in the last three or four years, there has been a complete change in the differential between the North American price for gas and energy and the EU price for gas and energy. ‘That represents a strategic change in the terms of trade and is very significant. The EU needs to respond to this very quickly.’ Although there are some gas interconnectors already linking countries within Europe and electricity interconnectors between the UK and France, the Netherlands and Ireland, Mr Davey called for swift action to boost the system to ensure Britain can compete with the United States, where energy prices are far lower. ‘We need much better grid interconnectors around Europe to enable energy to flow across the EU. Connecting the UK with mainland Europe and different parts of the periphery of Europe with central Europe,’ he told the newspaper. The government's energy regulator has said that changes to energy bills coming into force today will show consumers that 'there are savings out there' and stop them being 'bamboozled' by complicated tariffs. 'Bamboozled' no more: Ian Marlee of Ofgem, pictured, said energy market reforms would help consumers . The changes brought in by watchdog Ofgem mean that a wide array of tiered plans and discounts - which often did not provide the savings people expected - have been banned. Now energy companies are limited to offering four tariffs for gas and four for electricity, which is meant to make it easier to compare companies and access the best deals. Hailing 'the most radical set of reforms to the retail and wholesale market since competition began', Ofgem senior partner Ian Marlee told the Today programme that 'this market is getting easier and there are savings out . there they can make. He said: 'We’re responding to what consumers have told us. What they want is that combination of choice and simplicity and that’s what we’re delivering. 'Putting all this package of reforms together is actually about making this market much more competitive so that there’s appropriate pressure on prices, profits and quality of service for consumers. 'The real message to consumers today is this market is getting easier and there are savings out there they can make.' However, Ofgem was criticised by consumer group Which? for not going far enough to help customers. A statement said that the reforms are 'a welcome step in the right direction', but 'do not go far enough... at a time when millions are struggling with the cost of living.' ‘This is why the Government should intervene with more radical measures including simpler pricing, greater transparency and scrutiny of the cost of energy policies, and the separation of supply from generation businesses. 'More must be done to keep prices in check and give consumers confidence that the price they pay for their energy is fair.’","It's left customers out of pocket by up to £150 over the last three years .

He . added: ‘If any honest statistician had made the same painstaking but . assumption-based calculations, the last word he/she would have used to . describe the  estimates is “precise” – unless exhaustion had affected . judgment. ‘Most . of the underlying crude assumptions that the all-embracing approach has . been obliged to make have not been subject to sensitivity tests that . might have been made if the study had not been so obviously driven to . make the case it claims to have made.’ Prof . Stone and statistician Nigel Williams point out flaws in the paper’s . findings in new research published by the Civitas think-tank. The . independent analysis accuses Dustmann and Frattini of using . questionable methods to process the data, having an ‘inadequate . understanding’ of the data and ‘significantly overstating their case’. Small changes to the ‘large assumptions’ about benefit claims the report was based on could make the positive contribution supposedly made by migrants disappear. Prof Dustmann was one of the academics behind the prediction that only 13,000 migrants from Poland and other Eastern European nations would come after controls were dropped in 2004. In the event, more than one million arrived in almost a decade. Unclear picture: The Government has not revealed estimates about how many Romanians or Bulgarians would arrive in the UK from today onwards . Civitas director David Green said: . ‘The UCL study’s claims were held up by many as evidence that . immigration from Romania and Bulgaria is unquestionably a good thing. ‘But, . as our forensic analysis by two respected statisticians shows, the . study’s methodology was flawed and its findings were highly . questionable. ‘The authors made schoolboy errors in their handling of statistics which fell short of the professional standards recognised by statisticians. 'It is regrettable that even academics from an august institution like UCL can only see what they want to see. ‘Yet again the BBC has failed in its duty to provide the public with impartial information. It has the resources to double-check conclusions based on statistical studies but instead seized on the conclusions to bolster its pre-existing prejudices.’","Report by UCL researchers Christian Dustmann and Tommaso Frattini .

Even the most diligent of AS-level students may not have been fully prepared for one of the questions in their recent Latin exam. Young classicists – usually aged between 16 and 17 – were asked to read and offer a ‘personal response’ to an ancient but explicit account of sexual intercourse. The passage from The Amores - one of Ovid’s collection of erotic poetry - describes in the racy embrace of two lovers. Erotic: An erotic scene from Ovid's The Amores, as painted by Adolphe . William Bouguereau, caused controversy among academics after its inclusion in an AS-level exam . A version of the poem translates on . passage as '... slip off your chemise without a blush and let him get . his thigh well over yours. 'And . let him thrust his tongue as far as it will go into your coral mouth . and let passion prompt you to all manner of pretty devices. '... slip off your chemise without a blush and let him get his thigh well over yours.

Say all sorts of naughty things, and let the bed creak and groan as you writhe with pleasure.' The addition of the passage, which was part of a longer section of verse from Ovid's poems published in the 1st century BC, in the exam for children provoked consternation from one leading academic. Professor John Ellis, a reader in . physics at Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, and fellow at Gonville and . Caius College, said the exam board was not in their 'right minds' to . include the passage for children as young as 16. He told the Times: 'How would a school . react to such material distributed on their premises? 'Many teachers . would have glossed over this extract, assuming no one in their right . minds would set it in an exam.' The text featured in an AS-level Latin . paper on Tuesday set by the University of Cambridge OCR board. Controversial: The inclusion of passages from explicit erotic poetry in AS-level exams - typically sat by pupils aged 16 and 17 - has been criticised by a leading academic. (file picture) Students were awarded up to 10 marks out of a total of 100 on the paper for their answers.Mary Beard, Professor of Classics at .

An OCR spokesman said not including the passages would be tantamount to 'censorship' and would deny students the opportunity to study some of the finest elegiac poems ever written. The elegiac style is a poetic technique where each couplet usually makes sense on its own, while forming part of a larger work. The spokesman said: 'Ovid’s Amores . poems are considered by professionals to be some of the finest examples . of elegiac poetry that there are. 'To censor such material would only . leave young adults with a false perception of their area of study.

Third class rail travel could return to Britain as the government faced claims it was turning the clock back half a century. Plans to re-privatise the East Coast main line from London to Aberdeen include proposals for three different classes of travel. Unions warned the return to a controversial ticketing system, not seen since it was ditched by British Rail in June 1956, raised the prospect of cut-price budget service seen on airlines like Ryanair. Back to basics: The idea of a third class of train travel would mark a return to a system not seen for 50 years . Unions also accused the government of trying to ‘bulldoze through’ the re-privatisation of the East Coast line which has been in state hands for four years. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said it had seen a copy of the prospectus for returning the East Coast Mainline to a private operator by early 2015. The Department for Transport has been considering recreating a third class of rail travel for at least a year. Ministers have suggested it could be an additional class of travel between the existing first and standard classes – broadly equivalent to a 'premium economy' class on airlines. It comes just days after Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin suggested the government could strip out first class carriages from busy routes to make more room for standard ticket holders. On track: The East Coast line has been in state hands since 2009, but ministers want it returned to the private sector by 2015 . Open-topped: It was only in 1844 that the law was passed to ensure third-class carriages were covered. This drawing appeared in a newspaper in 1847 . Third . class travel first became an option in 1838. Six years later an act of . parliament forced train companies to provide a roof in third class. The . 1844 Railway Act stipulated that all third-class passengers should be . carried in covered accommodation. Railway companies also began providing . lighting in third-class carriages. However, whereas there were several . oil lamps in the first class carriages, third-class carriages only had . one. In 1844 the railways introduced Parly & Gov class for government workers. The Pullman car, introduced in Britain in 1874, created a new level of comfort. Midland . Railway abolished second class travel in 1875, upgrading third class . passengers to second class standards. Other railways followed the . example. Second class disappeared from fare tables until . 1956, when third class was renamed second. British Rail later renamed . this standard class. But RMT general secretary Bob Crow . said: ‘This leaked document, coming on the day of union protests at . Parliament aimed at keeping the East Coast in public ownership, is . political dynamite which blows the lid off the lengths to which the . Government are prepared to go to bulldoze through re-privatisation . before the next election. ‘If . the Government are allowed to get away with this, passengers can expect . third class services, shoddy performance and higher fares while the . private companies get a gold-plated, eleven year franchise that will . enable them to launder hundreds of millions of pounds into the pockets . of their shareholders. It stinks and it must be stopped.’ He . said if the third-class plan went ahead it could be a 'Ryanair model . with passengers rammed in to creaking cattle trucks with a surcharge for . everything from your bags to using the lavatories'. The draft prospectus gives firms bidding for the franchise to run services on the line the option of establishing an intermediate ‘class between Standard and First’. It could mean customers who book standard tickets in advance are guaranteed a seat, while those without bookings are crushed into even less space in what would effectively be third class. Mary Creagh, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, said: ‘David Cameron says we're all in this together, but if that's true then why is he going back to the 1950s and reintroducing third class? ‘East Coast passengers deserve better than this. East Coast is working well and will have returned £800 million to the taxpayer by the end of this financial year.’ Campaigners have highlighted figures announced last week which showed that East Coast paid £208 million in premium and dividend payments to the Treasury in the last financial year. Anger: RMT union boss Bob Crow said the plan to re-privatise the East Coast line 'stinks' and should be stopped . Its turnover increased by 4.2 per cent and it carried more than 19 million passengers - up 1 per cent on the previous year. The campaigners also point out that figures from the Office of Rail Regulation show that East Coast received the lowest public subsidy of any rail operator by some considerable margin. In addition, those keen to keep East Coast publicly run say that the Government is rushing through this particular re-franchising so it takes place before the 2015 general election. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘The independent Brown Review into rail franchising was clear that franchising remains the best way to secure services for passengers. ‘A strong private-sector partner will not only provide certainty of ownership for the East Coast franchise but will be best placed to build on the significant investment planned for the route, delivering benefits to passengers and taxpayers for years to come.’","Department for Transport included option in prospectus for line sell-off .

The mother of the 13-year-old girl at the center of a battle to turn off her life-support machine broke down Wednesday as she told how she will be scarred forever by the look of fear in her daughter’s eyes as she slipped away. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline on a break from her bedside vigil, Nailah Winkfield cried as she said that her 'pretty, sweet daughter' was the 'innocent victim' of a routine operation that went tragically wrong. Jahi McMath suffered complications after having her tonsils removed causing her heart to stop and massive brain damage that the hospital say is so severe that she is effectively dead. Mrs Winkfield, who believes her daughter can recover and is fighting plans to turn off her ventilator, said watching her daughter suffering will haunt her forever. 'My daughter started to bleed and that will scar me forever because it happened in front of my face, in front of my mother’s face, in front of my husband’s face,' she said on a break in the grounds of Children’s Hospital, Oakland, California. 'She was very scared. She knew something was wrong. To see your daughter like that is just heartbreaking. 'But I still have hope. In fact I have . more than hope.

Hope: Marvin and Nailah Winkfield were granted an injunction a few days ago to keep Jahi alive until January 7th, 2014. Mrs Winkworth, 34, a Home Depot worker, was comforted by her husband Marvin, 33, a truck driver, as she sat on the wall outside the hospital which she has not left since December 9th when the complications occurred. 'I never knew I would have to fight a hospital to treat my daughter,' she said. 'I find it unbelievable.  I have not been home since December 9th, I have been sleeping in the waiting room. I cannot leave Jahi.' She said that the way the hospital has treated her daughter and the family has been 'disgusting'. 'The way the hospital has behaved towards me is outrageous. It is disrespectful. It is disgusting. 'They don’t even refer to her by name. They refer to her as the deceased, or the body, or the dead and my daughter is not dead. 'They are awful, they have no compassion.' Mrs Winkfield, who has three other children, said all she wanted to do was get her daughter away from the hospital to a place that cared for her. Holding on: Marvin and Nailah Winkfield react as they pose for photos showing off a shirt in honor of Nailah's daughter Jahi McMath during an interview with the Mail Online outside of Children's Hospital in Oakland  on January 1, 2014 . 'The doctors here pretty much want my daughter gone', she said. 'I want the same thing but I want her out of here alive, they want her out of here dead. 'I blame the hospital for what happened. They should say ‘hey let’s do what’s right for this little girl, we messed her up,  we owe her, the least we can do is let her get out of here’.' She said that feels a mixture of anger, sadness and guilt. 'I feel angry at the hospital,' she said. 'Sad for my daughter and guilty because I made her have the operation. 'She told me not to make her have the operation. She was scared. She said her worst fear was never waking up, that’s what she told me. That is why I feel guilty. 'I just wished I had picked a different hospital. When I first heard things had gone wrong,  I passed out from shock.' Wedding: This photograph shows Jahi McMath (right) at the wedding of her step-father Marvin Winkfield (2nd right) to her mother Naliah (not pictured) - also in this photograph are Mariana Winkfield (left) and her grandmother Sandra Chatman (2nd left) She said she was puzzled why the hospital was blocking the family’s bid to move Jahi. 'I think they are trying to cover up something and I think they would rather she dies than I prove them wrong that she is alive,' she said. One of the issues, is that the hospital is refusing to fit a feeding tube to the patient as they say they don’t operate on dead people. The operation must be carried out before a care facility can take her in. 'I don’t believe what the hospital are saying,' said Mrs Winkfield. 'If she was an organ donor she would have everything to make her body healthy,' she said. 'In fact she would have much better treatment if she was an organ donor but since I want her to live she doesn’t have proper treatment.' Putting her head in her hands she borke down and sobbed as she said: “She was so pretty. She didn’t deserve this. Precautions: Officials saw to it that the door to the Children's Hospital of Oakland was barricaded Monday in preparation for Jahi's family's press conference . 'I feel scared every day. I feel my daughter is on death row because they have only given us so much time. 'I feel like her life is like the sand in an egg timer and we are watching it pouring away. Every time we get a court order, a big hand comes out and turns it over. 'I just have to keep faith. I just want to get her away from here. They don’t want her here. 'That’s why they are not feeding her, that’s why they don’t refer to her by her name. That’s why they call her the deceased. 'She has not done anything to anybody. I had a good daughter. She don’t deserve what has happened to her.  She is an innocent victim. 'I spent Christmas here. I spent New Year’s here and I won’t leave. My New Year’s wish is that my daughter wakes up or the hospital softens their heart.' Tragedy: Jahi McMath, 13, was declared legally . brain-dead after undergoing a routine tonsil removal that dosctors . suggested as a means of eliminating her sleep apnea . Last photos: Mrs Winkfield snapped this picture of daughter Jahi the morning she took her to the hospital to undergo a tonsillectomy that ended up all but ending her life . Her husband added: 'It has been an emotional rollercoaster that she is on. Up one minute, down one minute. 'We got so many good memories. As they hit her and me, at different times. You are up one minute but a good memory just brings you down.' The couple were speaking as the hospital and family continued their war of words over the future of the teenager. Sam Singer, the spokesman for the hospital, said that the family’s lawyer Chris Dolan was cruelly perpetuating the 'hoax' that Jahi was still alive. Hospital spokesperson Sam Singer speaks to the media outside Children's Hospital in Oakland on  January 1, 2014.

He said it was a terribly sad case but that three doctors and the courts had agreed that there was no hope for the girl. But Mr Dolan, and the family, said this was not true and that the hospital was trying to deflect the blame of what had happened to Jahi. He said that they were close to finding a doctor and transport to move the patient to a new medical facility.

Above, a mall worker is pictured in Illinois pushing carts in the storm . Here it comes!: A powerful winter storm will wallop the Northeast this weekend . The National Weather Service has said 6 to 12 inches of snow are expected in New England, with as much as 14 inches possible along the Maine coast. Areas north and west of New York City and interior Pennsylvania could get 8 inches or more. About half a foot was forecast in parts of Ohio, where snow began falling overnight. Meteorologist Paul Head with the National Weather Service in State College, Pennsylvania, said winds will pick up into Sunday, presenting hazardous blowing snow for motorists. Temperatures in Connecticut dropped into the teens as snow began to fall there Saturday, and officials worried about road conditions since a saltwater solution normally applied before storms would freeze. But they were grateful the bad weather wouldn't affect work day commutes. 'The timing is pretty good coming on a weekend,' said Kevin Nursick, spokesman at the state Department of Transportation. But the weather is a cause for concern so close to the holidays, with many people out tackling their gift lists on the weekend. A large area: The storm will affect millions of people as it dumps as much as 18 inches of snow . No escape: Flights will be grounded, and traffic will be backed up as snow, sleet and freezing rain bring travel to a halt . Two-day event: The storm will last into Sunday for Boston and New England, but should be mostly over by Sunday morning for New York and Philadelphia . More on the way: People make their way across the Brooklyn Bridge during the season's first snow storm on December 10 . Kathy Grannis, a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation, said consumers likely will shop online. And the weekend before Christmas gives retailers and shoppers another opportunity after this weekend. 'If a big storm hits around the 21st, 22nd, it will be a completely different story,' Ms Grannis said. Caroline Pretyman, a spokeswoman for Northeast Utilities, which serves electric and gas customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, said extra crews would be available beginning overnight Saturday to respond to outages. New York City's Office of Emergency Management asked drivers to stay off the roads and, if they do drive, they should go slowly and stick to major streets or highways. In Pennsylvania, two state high school football championship games were moved from Saturday to Sunday because of a predicted 5 to 8 inches of snow. John Wallace, a spokesman at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, said airport officials were meeting with vendors and airlines to assess the impact of the storm. But he said he wasn't worried. 'It's New England. It's the wintertime,' he said. 'I think we're pretty well ready for whatever is headed our way.' But some areas, including resorts and ski towns in Northern New England, welcomed the snow and were eager to see the winter season get started. 'We have been watching (the forecast) since people first started talking about it on Monday or Tuesday,' said Ethan Austin, spokesman for the Sugarloaf Ski Resort in Carrabassett Valley, Maine. 'Right now it's setting up pretty well for us, so we're pretty psyched.'","940 flights have been cancelled at mostly Northeast and Midwest airports .

Nineteen animal activists, including a 12-year-old girl, were arrested at the parade in Pasadena as they allegedly attempted to stop the float from moving along the course. Their outrage follows the release of a documentary, Blackfish, which claims that SeaWorld mistreats Orca whales. Activists have since demanded that the theme park shut down its killer whale shows.

Islamic authorities in Malaysia seized 321 Bibles from a Christian group because they used the word Allah to refer to God. The raid reflects a growing religious intolerance in the Southeast Asian state where nearly two thirds of the population practice the state religion Islam. In October last year, a Malaysian court ruled that the Arabic word for 'god' was exclusive to Muslims, most of whom are ethnic Malays. Holy books: Authorities in Selangor state, Malaysia seized 321 Bibles written in Malay from a Christian group because they used the word Allah to refer to God (file photo) That ruling overturned a court decision that allowed a Roman Catholic newspaper printed in Malay, the country's national language, to use Allah. The change has heightened concern that religious authorities, which issue rulings for Muslims and operate alongside civil courts, now have more legal muscle. Analysts say new rulings that affect non-Muslims could be a way of deflecting anger against Prime Minister Najib Razak's government from poor Malay Muslims over subsidy cuts likely to force up electricity, petrol and sugar prices. On Thursday, authorities in Selangor  seized the Malay-language religious books from an organisation called the Bible Society. The society said authority officials escorted two of its officials to a police station to make statements after which they were released on bail. It is thought the restrictions against non-Muslim Malays is a way of deflecting from Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's recent cuts . 'We were told that we were under investigation for breaking a Selangor state law banning non-Muslims from using the word Allah,' said Bible Society of Malaysia Chairman Lee Min Choon. Christians from Malaysia's rural states of Sabah and Sarawak in Borneo, who have used the word Allah for centuries, have moved in droves to Selangor and other parts of peninsular Malaysia in recent years to look for work. The main political party within Najib's ruling coalition, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), said its Selangor members would protest at all churches in the state on Sunday against unauthorised use of the word Allah. 'There are laws in Selangor and there was a decree by his Royal Highness the Sultan. So what they are doing is carrying out the Sultan's decree,' Deputy Prime Minister and UMNO Deputy President Muhyiddin Yassin was quoted by media as saying. 'They are not doing anything against the law.' The Sultan of Selangor, one of nine sultans that serve in turn as titular Malaysian head of state, decreed last year that non-Muslims must refrain from using Allah in Bibles. He asked Muslims to unite against ""bad elements"" that misuse the word. The increasingly assertive stand by holders of the largely ceremonial office show that Muslim leaders have become increasingly vocal about their role in defending Islam. In 2010, arsonists firebombed several churches over the initial ruling that allowed the Catholic newspaper to use the Arabic word. Two Malay men were found guilty for setting fire to one of the churches.","Authorities in Selangor state seized 321 Bibles from a Christian group .

David Charles, 21, was busted after a tipster who paid hundreds of dollars online for the organs realized the material was from a museum and contacted police. Charles, from Indianapolis, allegedly broke into the Indiana Medical History Museum on multiple occasions to steal the jars and other preserved material. The museum is at the site of a former state hospital and the tissues come from around 2,000 patients with psychiatric and mental disorders who were autopsied there from the 1890s until the 1940s. The museum endured several break-ins at its storage facility and police had investigated, but they were only led to Charles after the phone call from the buyer, the Indianapolis Star reported. The San Diego man, who has not been named, had bought six jars of human brain tissue for $600 and called the museum after noticing labels on the . containers, court documents said.

'Claire was a gift to her mother and me and although we desperately wanted to hold onto this gift, we are learning to accept the fact it was time to return the gift to the giver,' he said.

"By . Ted Thornhill . PUBLISHED: . 10:37 EST, 2 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:25 EST, 2 January 2014 . Italian carmaker Fiat has signed an agreement to take full control of U.S. carmaker Chrysler, paving the way for the creation of the world’s seventh-largest auto group. The New Year’s Day announcement ends months of tense negotiations. Fiat Spa said it could complete its acquisition of Chrysler without having to raise new capital through a rights issue. Fiat Spa brought Chrysler out of bankruptcy in 2009 . Investors cheered the details of the deal, bidding the shares up 12 per cent on the Milan exchange. The stock was up by as much as 15.8 per cent earlier in the day. Fiat said it had reached an agreement with the United Auto Workers union-controlled trust fund holding 41.5 per cent of Chrysler's shares. Fiat already held all the other shares. Fiat will pay $1.75 billion (about 1.35 billion euros) in cash. Another $1.9 billion (almost 1.5 billion euros) will be paid as extraordinary dividends. The deal is due to close by January 20. The agreement caps the dream of Sergio Marchionne, Fiat's chief executive and CEO of Chrysler Group, to run a truly global automaker. Marchionne called the deal one of life's ‘defining moments that go down in the history books’. The world's largest automotive group is General Motors. Italian unions have long worried that Fiat's global reach could come at a cost, in terms of Fiat production in Italy, job security and contract conditions. Their leaders immediately pressed for guarantees, even appealing to the Italian government to help them protect their concerns. The agreement caps the dream of Sergio Marchionne, Fiat's chief executive and CEO of Chrysler Group, to run a truly global automaker . ‘The agreement reached between Fiat and the Veba (trust) fund heads off the risk of a merger failure, but we contend that the acquisition of the remaining capital shares of Chrysler group was possible thanks to the maximizing of industrial capital and of human capital of the workers of Fiat Group in Italy,’ said Michele De Palma, in charge of the FIOM metalworkers' union at the automaker. ‘In fact, the ownership didn't have to recapitalize to reach 100 per cent of Chrysler,’ De Palma said in a written statement. ‘Before celebrating, we contend it is fundamental to understand the deal's terms.’ The union leader added that he will ask the premier's office to summon all sides to talks about ‘the employment and industrial future of the Italian plants, and thus have certainty about the investments for the industrial plan of our country.’ Italy is mired in recession and plagued by unemployment. Fiat Spa brought Chrysler out of bankruptcy in 2009. The Italian company in late October lowered its 2013 earnings targets amid continued weakness in the European economy and car markets and lower sales in Brazil. Without Chrysler, Fiat would have lost significantly more in the third quarter of 2013.","The deal saw shares in Fiat surge by 12 per cent on the Milan exchange .

The new owners will need to lift the house, a rare 1926 Sears Wellington model, off the current plot and move it somewhere else, and that could cost up to $50,000. Free: The house in Arlington won't cost you a penny - but moving it will . The house cost the owner $750,000, but it's too small for her needs . The unnamed homeowner bought the house for $750,000 last September, but found that it wasn’t quite big enough for her needs. As the house has some historical worth – it still has the original door frames and wooden shingles – she decided, with her architects Paola Lugli and Paola Amodeo, that it would be a crying shame to demolish it. They’re hoping now to find someone willing to tackle the complications and expense of detaching the house from its utility connections, building a foundation somewhere else, moving the house over to it and reconnecting it. The property is a rare 1926 Sears Wellington model that comes complete with the original door frames and wooden shingles . The architects estimate that it'll cost up to $50,000 to move the house and reconnect it . Amodeo told The Washington Post: ‘We need someone with an adventurous spirit. Someone who can appreciate the project.’ The house, the architect explained, is part of America’s history and demolishing such a building is not part of the firm’s philosophy. The house is located in an upmarket area of Washington DC, where five and six-bedroom houses are commonplace .","The house was bought last year for $750,000, but is too small for the owner .

A German man had to be tied up on board an airplane after he tried to smoke during the flight and got violent when staff tried to stop him. Mathias Jorg, 54, lit up several times on a 7½ hour flight from Singapore to Brisbane and had to be detained by staff after he allegedly became aggressive. A photograph taken on the plane by a fellow passenger, show Mr Jorg with his legs and arms tied up, surrounded by cabin crew. Held down: Mathias Jorg, a German national, is restrained for smoking on an international flight to Brisbane, Australia from Singapore on January 2 . When the Emirates Air flight landed in Brisbane just after 1am on Thursday morning, Mr Jorg was taken into police custody. He appeared before Brisbane Magistrates Court later the same day, charged with one count of smoking on an aircraft, one count of assaulting crew and one count of assaulting crew affecting the performance of their duty. Mr Jorg had to use a German interpreter during his court visit, and claimed that he had been injured during the restraining. He has been allowed bail after promising to surrender his passport to the Australian Federal Police and make no applications for another, and that he would not leave Australia or go within 100 metres of any place of international departure. On bail: Mr Jorg appeared before Brisbane Magistrates Court on Thursday, wearing plasters on his wrists and with a bruised forehead, where he had to relinquish his German passport . Although he initially protested through his interpreter, explaining that he didn't 'trust' the conditions of the court, he eventually agreed to give up his passport, Courier Mail reports. He will appear before Brisbane Magistrates Court again on January 10. Although there is no internationally agreed convention covering restraining passengers on airplanes, what cabin crews are allowed to do to control unruly passengers is governed by the laws of the country where the airplane is registered. The decision to restrain a passenger is in the hands of the captain, who also must notify authorities at the destination and give the reason for the restraint.","Mathias Jorg, 54, had to be detained after trying to smoke on a flight .

A man who was run over as a child was stunned when his barber found and pulled out a stitch that had been in his head - for 52 years. Dave Graystock, 60, was having his regular trim when his barber Kevin Gavaghan discovered the stitch poking out of his client’s head. The thread is believed to have been in his head since he suffered injuries when he was run over by a school delivery van in 1961 at the age of eight. A man who went for a haircut has revealed how his barber pulled out a stitch that had been in his head - for 52 years . A young Mr Graystock in hospital at the time of the accident. Due to complications he spent 10 months in hospital. Right, the stitch that was in Mr Graystock's head for five decaded . The stitch hasn’t been visible for over half-a-century and Mr Graystock, of Gomersal, West Yorkshire, assumed the tiny lump on his head was scar tissue until the barber spotted the stitch and pulled it clean out. He said: 'Kevin’s cut my hair for 19 years and has always avoided that area because he felt something. I thought it was scar tissue. 'It took me a while to figure out where on earth the stitch had come from. 'But later that night it hit me like a sledgehammer. I've no idea how this stitch got missed. 'I think Kev must have pulled the . hair a bit further back, followed the scar up with his finger and . noticed this bit of stitch poking out. 'He said to me ""you've got a stitch in your head"" and he asked if I wanted him to snip it and pull it out.' Mr Graystock suffered a fractured leg and skull after being run over by a delivery van at Dewsbury Moor school. The stitch hasn't been visible for over half-a-century and Dave assumed the tiny lump on his head was scar tissue until barber Kevin spotted the stitch and pulled it clean out . Conscious, he tried to crawl away - but the driver thought he was under the wheels and reversed onto him. He . said: 'I ran straight into him - he couldn’t stop. I never met him, but . if I did I’d shake his hand. It must have been horrendous.' I couldn’t have anaesthetic because of the head injury. They had . to get glass out of my skull. It was horrible - they had to hold me . down.' The retired painter and . decorator said that the scar on his head was approximately a . quarter-inch long and used to be sensitive. AccidentMr Graystock suffered a fractured leg and skull after being run over by a delivery van at Dewsbury Moor school, now Knowles Hill Infant and Nursery School . Up The Junction, the barber shop Mr Graystock has used for 19 years . 'The bump had always felt weird but I just dismissed it,' he said. 'I'd had a lot of bumps and bangs through the years and didn't think anything of that particular scar. 'I'm . not angry about it, though - I'm laughing about it really. I think the . whole thing's pretty funny - one that's guaranteed to get people in . stitches anyway.' While recovering he developed a rash and was kept in isolation for two weeks.He had the stitches taken out but now realises medics missed one. He was diagnosed with bone disease osteomyelitis following his injuries. After an emergency operation he ended up missing 10 months of school. 'The bump had always felt weird but I just dismissed it.

Eventually Mr Graystock recovered and forgot about his ordeal. He said: 'I’ve had a few bangs on my head over the years but I’ve never had any other serious injuries. The nit nurse used to come to school to check us, obviously she didn’t look very carefully. 'It’s the strangest thing that’s ever happened to me.'

A son who mistakenly spent 21 years visiting a cemetery where he thought his father's ashes were scattered has discovered they were actually kept in a disused storage room. John Strong, 63, left instructions for the ashes of his father, Roye, to be scattered over a memorial rose garden when he died in 1992 aged 74. He and his family, who did not wish to see the scattering as it would have been too upsetting, had no reason to believe that their wishes had not carried out. Lost: John Strong and his wife Marie, pictured outside the crematorium with his the late Phyllis Strong's ashes . But this year Mr Strong found out that an administrative error meant that the ashes had never been put there - and that they had spent more than two years in storage. However, in a happy twist, the discovery means that the ashes of the late Mr Strong can be reunited with those of his wife. While he was alive he had said he wanted his remains to be scattered at a picturesque location in Canley Crematorium, Coventry. Mr Strong had worked in the area all his life at a factory which made heavy machinery. In the Second World War Mr Strong, who had a reserved occupation, helped produce supplies to fight the Nazis. He had two children with his wife Phyllis. The two assumed they would be able to arrange for their ashes to be scattered in the same place, but the family were outraged to discover it would not be possible as there was no definitive record of what happened to Mr Strong's remains. New rules brought in at the crematorium means that ashes can only be scattered on the rose garden if those of a relative were already there. Mr Strong, a painter and decorator with three children of his own, said: 'When . my mother passed away, we were told that her ashes could be scattered . over the Peace Rose at Canley Crematorium only if the remains of a . relative of hers had been put there, too. 'We told them that her . husband’s ashes had been scattered there, but then we received a letter . from Coventry Bereavement Services telling us that they have no record . of my father’s ashes being scattered there as we instructed. 'We’ve been going to the crematorium . for years, because that’s where we told them to scatter my father’s . ashes. That’s what he wanted. Separated: Roye Strong, right and Phyllis Strong, left, had planned to have their ashes scattered over the same memorial rose garden . 'At . the time, my sister and I did not want to be present - I regret that . now.' The Strong family had struggled for months to find out what had happened to the lost ashes and, after months of chasing, it was today revealed that they had been left in a disused storage room decades earlier. The funeral took place so long ago, according to directors Henry Ison & Son, that there were no proper procedures for storing unclaimed ashes, which led to them being misplaced. After the family got in touch asking after them, the staff searched the new storage facility but did not find anything. However, a renewed search over Christmas uncovered an unmarked box in the storage room. It contained an urn of ashes, which the company has now confirmed they are the lost remains. Today Mr Strong said it was a 'pleasant shock' to have the remains returned, but that he went through 'months of hell' not knowing where they were. He said: 'It’s great that they’re found, but we’ve been through months of absolute hell. We can hopefully go up and scatter them all together. 'There should have been an instruction to scatter the ashes. Somehow the arrangements didn’t go to the crematorium... I suppose we’ll never know for sure. 'I feel a bit bitter now because of how they treated us - I feel completely let down. They didn’t do their job properly 20 years ago. Somebody made a big mistake. 'It’s a pleasant shock to find that they were found, but we’ve gone through months of banging our heads against the wall. This has come completely out of the blue. 'I’m going to see him tomorrow to arrange both sets of ashes to be scattered.' Henry Ison & Son said they recognised the 'distress' caused by the mix-up, but were pleased they could find what had happened to the remains. A statement from the company said: 'An unmarked box has now been discovered in a closed-off secure area which is seldom accessed by the current team and was therefore not searched previously. 'Within the box, we discovered a set of cremated remains which we have now been able to identify as belonging to the Strong family. 'We are really pleased that we are now able to return the missing cremated remains to Mr Strong, as we recognise the distress that this must have caused him and his family during this period of uncertainty.' According to the company, problems with unclaimed ashes are becoming more common in the funeral industry. In 2012 the director of William H Painter in Birmingham but out a last-ditch appeal in the hope that relatives would claim some of the 150 sets of remains he had been left with.","John Strong, 63, asked for remains to be put over a memorial rose garden .

Jackie Powell, the Moors Murderer's self-styled mental health advocate, said his behaviour had become increasingly bizarre and medical experts believed he was now seriously ill. The revelation has prompted fears that he may become unable to remember where he buried Keith Bennett, the only one of his five young victims whose remains have never been found. Behind bars: Ian Brady (left), 76, was jailed for life in 1966 along with his now-dead girlfriend Myra Hindley (right) Brady, 76, was jailed for life in 1966 along with his girlfriend Myra Hindley for abducting, abusing, torturing and killing five youngsters in Manchester before burying them on nearby Saddleworth Moor. He has been held at Ashworth high-security psychiatric hospital in Liverpool since 1985. Regular visitor: Jackie Powell, Brady's close confidante, has visited him regularly since 1999 . Miss Powell, who has visited Brady regularly since 1999, told the Daily Mirror that during a recent meeting with him she saw signs of dementia, and believed he was nearing the end of his life. But she said that Brady would not accept that there was anything wrong and refused to undergo tests that could confirm whether he has Alzheimer's disease. She said: ‘Brady has to be in control and getting dementia is his worst nightmare. ‘No one who meets him could ever deny that he had a very sharp mind. He is highly intelligent and insists on dealing with things on his own terms. 'He never wants to expose his feelings so he is terrified of losing his self-control. He'd never admit it, but I believe he is frightened about what is happening to him.’ Miss Powell said that Brady had withdrawn into himself, and that he now seems to be ‘waiting to die’. Investigation: Police and volunteers search Saddleworth Moor in October 1965 for the bodies of the children killed by Brady and Hindley . Killed: The revelation has prompted fears that Brady may become unable to remember where he buried Keith Bennett (pictured), the only one of his five young victims whose remains have never been found . She also said she believed it highly unlikely he would ever reveal where Keith Bennett is buried, saying that he refuses to even discuss it. Last night a solicitor for the Bennett family, who have campaigned for years for Brady to reveal where he buried the 12-year-old, appealed for him to give up his secret while he can. 'He'd never admit it, but I believe he is frightened about what is happening to him' Ian Brady . John Ainley told the Mirror: ‘If he deteriorates and is not able to impart this information then it may be that Keith is never found.’ Brady was denied a transfer from Ashworth to a normal prison last summer after a tribunal declared him to still be insane. Along with Hindley - who died in jail aged 60 in 2002 - Brady killed Pauline Reade, 16, John Kilbride, 12, Keith Bennett, 12, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17, between 1963 and 1965.","Jackie Powell says medical experts believe Brady, 76, is now seriously ill .

I've been trying not to get too angry about . it, but it's absolutely appalling. It is heartless. It is ridiculous, . they are letting down a vulnerable pensioner. They are just not caring. 'BT Openreach are totally uncontactable - they are a world to their own. I just feel angry.' After firing off a string of emails to their customer care department, Mr Hingston was eventually put through to someone on December 30 who said they wouldn't be able to look at the problem for another two days. And he was sent an email by Matthew King, a senior manager at BT, apologising for the problems his mother was experiencing, but saying he was unable to help because it related to another department. Mr Hingston said: 'It is just a case of passing the buck. If a department in my business told a customer ‘It's not my department, I can't help' I would be bust in a year. 'It has really blighted our family's Christmas and New Year. I have spending all my time on the internet trying to contact someone all Christmas, but to no avail. We have all been really worried. 'I have a brother living in America and he's been frantic because he hasn't been able to get through to our mum. And my mother has been really upset. It is outrageous.' An Openreach spokesman said: 'Openreach is trying to repair Mrs Hingston's phone line as quickly as possible, having been alerted to the problem by Mrs Hingston's phone supplier on December 27. 'An engineer has already been dispatched and discovered a faulty overhead cable. In order to replace the cable we need to block the road and arrange for temporary traffic lights.

An amateur photographer took these amazing shots of the clear night sky on a camera attached to telescopes from his back garden. The area known as the heart and soul nebula can be clearly seen in one photo glowing red in the dark sky, lit up by the surrounding stars. In other photos, the orion and scorpion nebula - invisible to the naked eye - can also be seen amongst the stars . Greg Parker, 59, from Brockenhurst, Hampshire, installed two £3,000 observatories in his garden and attached cameras to the telescopes inside them. The cameras are mounted on special trackers which trace the movement of stars across the sky. Awe-inspiring: These pictures of the heart and soul nebula are made even more impressive by the fact an amateur astronomer took them from his back garden . Music of the spheres: The night sky above the impressive setup in Mr Parker's Hampshire garden . High technology: Mr Parker installed two £3,000 observatories in his garden in order to indulge in his hobby . Sitting in the control room in his house, Mr Parker, a professor in photonics at the University of Southampton, remotely operates the four cameras on four different computer screens. Sadly, Mr Parker may not be able to take these extraordinary photos for much longer. A streetlight which lights up the garden currently uses sodium yellow lamp which doesn’t affect his ability to take photos of the sky. However, Hampshire County Council plan on changing the bulbs in the area with white LED bulbs - and their stronger light at night means he cannot use his observatories. The university professor remotely operates the four cameras on four different computer screens using a powerful computer in his home . In his observatory, Greg has been working on a new technique for producing very wide-field deep-sky images.  Left is a view centred on the Cocoon nebula in Cygnus and the objects on the right are in the Perseus constellation . Ingenious: This is the Canon DSLR that takes the wide field images. An electric motor and drive belt allow Greg to manually focus the lens. Mission control: The control room setup in Mr Parker's house. He only took up stargazing in 2002 when he brought his first telescope . He said: 'If they go ahead with their plans to carry out the change I will have to move house. It’s really bad. It’s cheaper and can be turned down later at night but the telescopes won’t work in all the light.' He took the pictures at 10-15 minute . intervals over four hours. He’s able to clearly construct the outlines . of the famous nebula in the sky and stitches the 16-20 . images together using astronomical software - allowing him to create the . crystal clear photos of the sky at night. Greg Parker, the amateur astronomer who took the incredible pictures. However, he now fears new streetlights close to his home could derail his work . Mr Parker said: 'On the back of the telescope there is a camera which captures special exposures. 'It sits on a mount and accurately tracks the moving stars while taking a series of photos. 'An electric motor and drive belt allow me to carefully and manually focus the lens via a USB to my main house computer. 'The mount moves the same way as the stars across the sky and takes sharp images at intervals to my choosing.' He only took up stargazing in 2002 when he brought his first telescope. Two years later, he got his first observatory set up in his garden courtesy of Pulsar Domes, a company in Cambridge selling astronomical accessories. The second one was set up two years ago and he’s been taking photos of the night sky ever since. Mr Parker added: 'The observatories are different because they contain different sets of telescopes. 'One has a reflecting telescope and the other a refracting one. 'I’ve always been interested in astronomy but I only got my first telescope in 2002, so I’ve been doing it for 11 years now.' Mike Clements with his homemade 70-inch telescope . Despite being 93 million miles away, amateur astronomer Jose Manteca manages to capture stunning shots of the sun from his back garden. Mr Manteca, who works as a sales representative, installed a small observatory on the terrace of his house in Barcelona. Ever since he has used a humble DSLR camera to capture breathtaking shots - including solar prominences, sunspots and even a plane crossing the face of the sun. Mike Clements has taken a lifelong passion and turned it into a record-setting astronomical achievement. The long-haul trucker from West Jordan, Utah, has single-handedly built a 70-inch telescope — the largest one on record to be crafted by an amateur astronomer, enabling users to see constellations previously visible only through the £1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope. Clements bought the 900-pound mirror — which was originally destined to go into space as part of a spy satellite until the edge of it was chipped during its manufacture — after it was auctioned off. An amateur astronomer has become the first person to capture a massive lightning strike 'into space' above the British Isles. The atmospheric phenomena, known as sprites, had never been recorded in the UK before an amateur astronomer in East Yorkshire managed to take the photographic first. Richard Kacerek, 33, spotted the sprite - caused by an upward lightning discharge five miles east of Hull - has sparked excitement in the scientific community with his image.","Greg Parker took breathtaking images from two £3,000 observatories in back garden in Brockenhurst, Hampshire .

Heather Smith, from Leicester, was struck by a 74-year-old man in an unprovoked attack while walking along a corridor at Alston House, Leicester early on Christmas morning. Mrs Smith, who is 83 and described as 'very frail and vulnerable', said she no longer feels safe at the care home and claims she had previously reported her attacker for pestering her. Battered and bruised: Heather Smith was attacked while walking along a corridor on Christmas morning. The 83-year-old says she no longer feels safe at Alston House care home . Mrs Smith's daughter Ruth Lawrence, 44, said: 'I could not believe it when I saw the injuries my mum sustained... I am disgusted this man was allowed to attack my mother'. She added: 'My mum does not feel safe there anymore and I am looking at bringing her home to live with me... It is a real shame because Mum was quite happy there.'

A museum is appealing for experts to help them decipher mysterious codes written on the side of a World War Two kamikaze plane. The Japanese 'Ohka 2' aircraft, captured in the Pacific 70 years ago, has been hanging in the rafters of an air museum for more than three decades. But when it was taken down and inspected more closely, curators found two sets of symbols etched on to the side of the plane, which was intended to be used by a suicide pilot as a flying bomb. Antique: This Ohka 2 kamikaze plane from World War Two is being restored at the Fleet Air Arm Museum . Mystery: Curators are appealing for experts to decipher these faded symbols on the aircraft hatch . One of the messages is found on the hatch cover, which would have held more than a ton of explosive material, while the other is on the left side of the plane. Both appear to combine Japanese symbols with other markings whose significance is unknown. Staff at the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovil, Somerset are now hoping that an expert will come forward who can explain the meaning of the writing. Ohka 2 aircraft, which were used by the Japanese military towards the end of the war, were deployed on kamikaze missions which killed thousands of Allied sailors. Display: The plane has been hanging from the rafters of the museum in Yeovil, Somerset for three decades . Bizarre: The drawings are a combination of Japanese characters and mysterious marks . Insignia: The plane is also emblazoned with a cherry blossom, which gives the aircraft its name . They were fixed to the underside of bomber planes, before being flown up to a height of 12,000ft and released. The vessels would be piloted by suicide pilots, who aimed for Allied ships and would inevitably die on impact. They could travel unaided for 21 miles, reaching a maximum speed of 475mph. Only 800 of the aircraft were ever made. The name of the plane means 'cherry blossom' in Japanese, and a picture of the flower is painted on its side along with the mysterious symbols. In action: A photograph of the Ohka flying bomb when it was in use during World War Two . Crashed: An Ohka plane captured in Okinawa after failing to hit its Allied military target . The model held by the Fleet Air Arm Museum is believed to have been captured by Allied troops in the Pacific. It is owned by the Science Museum in London, which lent it to the Fleet Air Arm Museum in 1982. 'It is chilling to look through the cockpit window of this piloted rocket and through the ringed sight,' said Jon Jefferies of the the Fleet Air Arm Museum. 'There's a grab handle fixed to the inner wall of the cockpit as acceleration generated by the three solid fuel rockets would have been incredible.' The aircraft is set to undergo a forensic restoration, with layers of paint being stripped off to reveal its original colour and markings. Fearsome: A group of suicide pilots waiting to be dispatched on their deadly final missions .

The youngster, who was detained by police in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, was one of 209 children aged under 18 have been arrested for drug offences in the area in the last three years. A Freedom of Information request shows in 2010, 78 under 18s were arrested in Kirklees - a total of 30 were for Class A drug offences. Arrests: A 12-year-old child was the youngest person arrested for drug dealing . The following year it dropped slightly to 71 with just seven for Class A drugs and by 2012 it had fallen to 60 with just eight offences involving Class A drugs. In 2012, police revealed 12,000 under 16's had been arrested for drugs offences across the country. The figures reveal youngsters are experimenting with cannabis, ecstasy, speed, cocaine and even heroin. The damning evidence was obtained by the Daily Mail through Freedom of Information Act requests to police forces. A total of 40 of the 43 forces in England and Wales responded, revealing 12,589 drug-related arrests of under-16s in the past three years. Among them were six ten-year-olds arrested for possession. The Metropolitan Police, the biggest force, said 3,592 under-16s were arrested for drugs offences.Avon and Somerset, Humberside, Essex, West Mercia, West Midlands and the Met each held a ten-year-old for possession. Offences: In 2012, police revealed 12,000 under 16's had been arrested for drugs offences across the country . The Government puts drugs in categories, or classes, which affect the punishment criminals will get for using or selling them. The penalties depend on the drug and the amount. Police will also look at whether a person is just using the banned substance or is selling it on. Penalties range from a caution to an unlimited fine and life in prison. Class A drugs are crack cocaine, cocaine, ecstasy (MDMA), heroin, LSD, magic mushrooms, methadone, methamphetamine (crystal meth). The penalty for possessing any of these drugs is up to seven years in prison. Source: gov.uk .

Det Chief Insp Paul Jeffrey from Kirklees CID, said: 'We have put in a number of positive initiatives to educate children and young people about the dangers of drugs and the harm they can have on our communities. 'It is clear this message is having the desired impact with these positive figures. 'I make no apology that our target and top priority remains those people who peddle in this miserable trade by either selling drugs or producing them (or both).' Harry Shapiro, from charity DrugScope, said: 'It is clearly very concerning when very young children are caught in up drug dealing. 'Fortunately, they represent only a very small minority of those involved in the drugs trade and overall, the figures for young people using drugs have been falling. Nevertheless, there are numbers of young people who are getting into difficulties with the new drugs that have appeared on the scene recently (sometimes called legal highs), and it is most important that services caring for these young people are adequately funded.'","Youngster was detained by police in Huddersfield, Yorkshire .

More than two decades ago, a 10-year-old schoolgirl threw a bottle into the sea off the coast of Hull as she embarked on a family holiday, hoping to get a response from a stranger in a faraway land. Inside the bottle was a scrawled letter from Zoe Lemon, a youngster with a love of ""ballet, playing the flute and the piano"", who had just boarded a ferry bound for a holiday in Germany. She told her prospective recipients of her pet hamster and fish, both called Sparkle, and her parents who were both teachers. Miss Lemon, of Salford, Greater Manchester, soon forgot about her act of whimsy, eventually marrying and having a child herself. But this Christmas she was staggered to receive a reply after 23 years. The bottle was discovered more than 350 miles away in the Netherlands by a man walking his dog, who wrote back. Zoe with the letter she placed in a bottle and threw into the sea as a child. She has recevied a reply after 23 years . The mother – whose surname is now Averianov – was amazed when her parents called for Christmas and said they had post from Europe. It turned out to be a reply to her letter from Piet and Jacqueline Lateur from near Rotterdam. Mr Lateur was walking his dog in the Oosterschelde dykes, near where he and his wife live in Serooskerke, when he found the bottle with Zoe’s letter inside. Childhood dreams: Zoe was ten years old (left) when she sent her message. The bottle was discovered more than 350 miles away in the Netherlands. It has held up remarkably well considering the time it spent adrift . Mrs Averianov, 33, who works in a jewellery shop, said: 'It’s been a bit crazy really. My parents came to visit on Christmas day and they had this letter from Europe addressed to my maiden name, Lemon. 'The first thing I saw was my handwriting as a child and my little letter  saying who I was and about my pets and my hobbies. It made me a bit emotional.' Since receiving the letter, Mrs Averianov has been in contact with Mr Lateur via email and asked to see photographs of where the bottle was found. He told her: 'I am keeping your little letter on my piano. I know you are no longer a little girl but you asked me to write you so I have.' Odyssey: The bottle's 23-year-long journey finally reached its end in Holland, 350 miles away . The original letter, left, and Piet Lateur's response, sent from Oosterschelde dykes, near where he and his wife Jacqueline live in Serooskerke, Holland . Mrs Averianov, who lived in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, when she was growing up, said: 'It’s amazing it was still undamaged. My dad has been looking at pictures of the area where it was found online and it looks as though there is a cove, so it could have been bobbing around there for years. 'My dad is ridiculously excited. I think he’ll be after visiting, but we have only been in contact a few days so only time will tell.' Mrs Averianov’s father, John Lemon, 68, had encouraged his daughter to throw the message into the sea on a family holiday and now she is considering doing the same for her five-year-old son Maksim. She said: 'I’ll probably wait until he’s a bit older and can understand and write a letter, but maybe we’ll do it by attaching it to a balloon.' The envelope, visible through the bottle, shows Earl Willard's address and where the letter was sent from . The oldest message in a bottle washed up on a beach after 107 years and a 1,115 mile odyssey. The green glass artefact (above) was spotted sitting on the shore of the secluded Schooner's Cove in Tofino, Canada. The note inside is signed by Earl Willard, who was 76 hours into a boat trip from San Francisco to Bellingham, Washington, when he 'posted' his note. The finder, Steve Thurber, caused outrage when he refused to open it and read the message inside, although he claims he is trying to preserve the contents. The previous Guinness World Record for a message in a bottle was 98 years after Scottish fisherman Andrew Leaper found a bottle in Shetland last year. The bottle in Scotland contained a postcard offering a reward of sixpence to the finder. A message in a bottle sent out to sea by a schoolgirl holidaying in Cornwall has washed up in Norway nearly 20 years later. Coventry resident Lucy Elliot, now 31, was just 12-years-old when she wrote the note in 1994 but she never expected to get a reply. Incredibly, the hand-written message was found recently by Kurt Johnny Haaland and his wife hundreds of miles away across the North Sea in Scandinavia. A message in a bottle written 54 years ago was discovered In an Arctic valley and may also include the last written words of a scientist who suffered a massive stroke at age 25. The note was found under a rock cairn on Canada's Ward Hunt Island. It was written by geologist Paul T.

Train firms barely make a profit, the rail minister insisted today as passengers were hit with New Year fare rises of 3.1 per cent, three times higher than average increases in pay. Stephen Hammond denied operators were using the railways as a 'cash cow', with companies making 'less than three pence in the pound' as profit. But despite government efforts to limit annual rises to the rate of inflation, passengers returning to work today complained of high costs and poor service with some annual season tickets now costing more than £5,000. Scroll down for video . Hike: Regulated rail fares have risen by 3.1 per cent today, much higher than average pay rises of just 1 per cent . The 3.1 per cent rise taking effect today is for regulated fares which include season tickets. The increase on unregulated fares, typically off-peak leisure tickets, is not capped. The regulated fare increase pushes some commuters into the £5,000-a-year club, with annual season tickets to London from Deal and Dover Priory costing £5,012. But despite the cost of a ticket, many commuters struggle to find a seat and are forced to stand, with ministers now considering paying rail firms millions of pounds to remove first class carriages to free up space for standard class passengers. Despite the latest round of fare hikes, rail minister Mr Hammond insisted profit was 'certainly not the aim'. 'That cannot be the aim if you look at the reality. The idea that there’s a huge amount of cash cow is just a nonsense. The average operator earns less than three pence in the pound,' he told ITV's Daybreak. 'The reality is that this is a Government that for the first time is guaranteeing to spend £16billion over the next five years, Network Rail will be spending £38billion over the next five years, putting in extra seats, extra capacity, upgrading the infrastructure of this company. Much of the fares passengers pay go exactly to that.' But a new study shows that rail fares are rising so fast that the Government will be making a profit from passengers by 2018. The report said that by then fares revenue will cover 103 per cent of the operating costs of the railways – up from 80 per cent in 2009. Research has found rail fares are rising so fast that the Government will be making a profit from passengers by 2018 . Average rises in regulated fares like season tickets have been capped at 3.1 per cent, in line with the rate of inflation in July.

The report by Credo commissioned by the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) also showed that by 2018, the Government's funding of the railways will have fallen to just 20 per cent, down from 38 per cent in 2009. Under the capped price-rise formula, each January rise is calculated from the Retail Price Index rNate of inflation figure for the previous July, which was 3.1 per cent. But train companies can also use a 2 per cent flexibility regulation, which lets them put some regulated fares up by 5.1 per cent, provided their overall average does not exceed the 3.1 per cent cap. In the cold and dark at King's Cross station in London, travellers spoke of their anger at the annual rise and their view that rail travel offered poor value for money. 'It's a lot of money for a poor service,' said teacher Simon Jones, 30, as he waited to board a train to Newcastle upon Tyne with his friend Ben James, 33. Mr Jones was on a leisure trip today but he and Mr James normally commute to work in London from Wandsworth in south west London. Mr Jones said: 'Fares are pretty high. My salary has just gone up 1% but fares are rising around 3%. There are delays on practically every day.' Mr James said: 'We're not really getting value for money. At Clapham Junction (in south London) you can hardly get on a train.' Labour's shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said the fare rise was 'a continuation of David Cameron's cost-of-living crisis', while Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said 2014 was 'all set to be another year of racketeering and greed on Britain's privatised railways'. Sustainable transport organisation Sustrans said: 'Commuters will still feel the pinch this new year because salaries aren't increasing by anywhere near the level of inflation.' Consumer group Which? said the fare increases 'will be a blow to people already feeling the financial squeeze', while campaign group Railfuture said: 'This latest fare rise comes after 10 years of inflation-busting fare increases, meaning that our trains are easily the most expensive in Europe.' The report also showed that by 2018, the Government's funding of the railways will have fallen to just 20 per cent . The CBT wants the Government to switch the measure on which they allow inflationary fare rises from 'retail' to the 'consumer' index of inflation, which they say is more in line with incomes. The CBT report said that between 2008 and 2013 the cost of a weekly season ticket from Reading to London has increased by 25 per cent, while average take-home pay rose by 9 per cent. CBT chief executive Stephen Joseph said: 'The Government must re-examine its fares policy as a matter of urgency and commit to a fairer system in line with the consumer price index so that fares only rise in line with wages.' The call comes as rail unions stage a protest today at King's Cross station in London highlighting the high cost of fares which they blame in part on the costs of rail privatisation.","Regulated rail fares rise by 3.1%, after ministers axed inflation-busting hike .

PUBLISHED: . 07:49 EST, 2 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 21:47 EST, 2 January 2014 . Is Cardiff the right move for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer? Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insisted he will have the final say on all footballing matters at Cardiff City after he was confirmed as their new manager. Such assurances from chairman Mehmet Dalman and owner Vincent Tan were one of the central strands of the negotiations that have led the former Manchester United striker from Norway to south Wales. His arrival came six days after Malky Mackay was sacked in acrimonious circumstances, though elements of uncertainty still surround the nature of the 40-year-old’s deal, with Dalman saying his ‘rolling contract’ was ‘infinite’. Despite repeated questioning, no definitive timescale was given for the contract. VIDEO Scroll down to watch: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer unveiled as the new Cardiff City manager .

Fresh start: Solskjaer speaks to the media after being appointed on a rolling contract at Cardiff .

But . the Norwegian has been told he can operate without interference and . echoed Sir Alex Ferguson when asked if he shared the Scot’s view that a . manager should be the most important man at a club. ‘I agree,’ Solskjaer said. There . were reports that Ferguson, who remains close to Mackay, had actually . advised Solskjaer last week to steer clear of working with Tan. Solskjaer dismissed those as ‘absolute nonsense’, before defending the . Malaysian millionaire after three months of chaos at the club, in which . numerous allegations of interference have surfaced. Big influence: Solskjaer is hoping to put everything he learned from Ferguson into practice by leading Cardiff to Premier League safety this season . Thumbs up: Cardiff owner Vincent Tan has managed to bag his first choice, Solskjaer, as boss . Time's up: Malky Mackay was sacked last Friday after a chaotic last three months in charge at Cardiff . Only one Norwegian has managed in the Premier League and that did not have a happy ending. Egil Olsen took charge of Wimbledon in 1999 but lasted for less than a season as the Dons were relegated from the Premiership (table below is all competitions) Two more Norwegians have managed in England, although both were in the Championship. Henning Berg was in charge of Blackburn for just 57 days, registering one win, three draws and six defeats in his time there and famously storming out of the club's Christmas party after he was made to go on stage and wear a stocking on his head, and a Michael Jackson wig, and dance on stage. Stale Solbakken was a disaster at Wolves in the first half of last season, beginning a campaign which was to end in relegation to League One. ‘He’s . the owner, he wants his club to be successful,’ Solskjaer said. ‘He has . ploughed loads of money into the club and he wants it to be successful. For me, I had a great meeting with him. ‘He . just confirmed to me that this is a man who wants his club to succeed, . he’s willing to help this club progress and develop into the Premier . League club. Not everything is as it seems from the outside.’ Dalman . has been a crucial figure in landing Solskjaer, who won two league . titles and a cup in his three years at Molde, before Tan flew him from . Norway to London on Wednesday for final discussions. Solskjaer . said: ‘I had great chats with Mehmet, and I met the owner, and they’ve . convinced me they want me to be in charge of the football, to take the . club forward.’ He added: ‘I am very confident that football matters, that is my matter.’ Quite . how this relationship plays out remains to be seen, with Dalman . insisting a new boardroom structure and ‘culture’ of dialogue will . preclude the sort of breakdown in relations that contributed to Mackay’s . exit. For his part, Solskjaer knows that Barclays Premier League survival is the least of Tan’s expectations. Here's looking at you: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Vincent Tan share a glance in the directors' box at the Emirates Stadium during Cardiff's match against Arsenal . Entrance: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (right) and Vincent Tan arrive at the Emirates ahead of Cardiff's game against Arsenal . New wave: Tan sheepishly acknowledges the camera as he and Solskjaer walk into the Emirates . The Ayatollah celebration was originally performed by the singer and fans of Welsh-language punk group U Thant before being adopted by Cardiff fans during the 1990s. The group's singer watched footage of the funeral of Ayatollah Khomeini and witnessed people doing the movement to express their grief and sadness. Bluebirds supporters used it during a match against Lincoln City in September 1990 and its popularity quickly grew. Former chairman Sam Hammam is well-known for performing the Ayatollah in front of travelling Leeds fans during an FA Cup tie in 2002, while current owner Vincent Tan has also celebrated with the unique gesture. Beyond that, Solskjaer has targeted a 15th-place finish in the table and the scalp of Swansea City. He . said: ‘I know what I’m going into and I’m so looking forward to it. I’m . going to bring my energy, enthusiasm, football knowledge. I want my . team to play exciting, attacking football. We want the fans to come here . and be proud of us. ‘I . will only ask for 100 per cent effort for the players, as I asked from . myself and as was hammered down, of course, by the gaffer (Ferguson) and . Roy Keane. But that’s the norm.’ He . added: ‘If this season you end up top 15 you are top five of the second . league in the Premier League. And (I would like to finish) above . Swansea.’ With another . Ferguson protege entering Premier League management, it will be . intriguing to see how closely such a mild-mannered man mimics his former . mentor. Taking his seat: Solskjaer (second left) in the directors' box at the Emirates as Cardiff owner Tan (bottom right) makes his way up . Taking charge: David Kerslake took charge of Cardiff for their draw with Sunderland and defeat to Arsenal . Asked if Vincent Tan was considering changing the colour of Cardiff's home shirts back to blue during Thursday's press conference, chairman Mehmet Dalman said he had 'nothing' to say. He said: ‘I . have obviously been moulded by him. I have not studied him but I have . worked under him and had the best teacher in man management or managing a . football club. ‘We . might be different personalities but for me I have learnt a few tricks . from him and took advice from him. You think back at times, “What did . the gaffer do when this and that happened?” So of course I am looking . through my diaries. ‘I . was a boring but a reflective man. I always used to write notes when I . was a coach. I stayed in his team talks, meetings so I have learnt from . him.’ PS Malky's back and smiling at Celtic . Malky Mackay, the man Solskjaer seems set to replace at Cardiff, was pictured at Parkhead ahead of Celtic's Scottish Premiership match against Partick Thistle. Mackay, who played for Celtic, was greeted by Lison Lion Bertie Auld and it seemed to take his mind off the acrimony surrounding his sacking by Vincent Tan.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller is said to be about to propose changing the Public Order Act so those who believe same-sex weddings are wrong can say so publicly without fear of prosecution . Critics of gay marriage are to get a new protection in law, senior government sources say. Culture Secretary Maria Miller is said to be about to propose changing the Public Order Act so those who believe same-sex weddings are wrong can say so publicly without fear of prosecution. The move is part of government attempts to prevent legislation running into further trouble as it progresses through Parliament. Faith minister Baroness Warsi abstained in a key vote in the House of Lords, telling friends that religious groups needed extra protection. Now the Culture Secretary is preparing to amend the Public Order Act so it is ‘clear that people will be protected who want to express their belief that marriage should be between a man and a woman’, a source said. Protections in the Act that exist for critics of ‘sexual orientation’ will be updated to cover same-sex marriage, it is understood. ‘It addresses the concern that there will be a chilling effect so that people, such as those of faith, will be afraid to express their views in public.’ The Government’s amendment is expected to be confirmed by Lords whip Baroness Stowell during the committee stage of the Bill, which starts today. The Department for Culture, which oversees the legislation, refused to comment on the plan. But during a Commons debate last month, Mrs Miller signalled the Government’s thinking. Referring to Britain’s tradition of tolerance and ‘rich tapestry of faith, belief and culture’, she said: ‘It is because of these strong traditions that enabling same-sex couples to marry will in no way undermine those who believe... that marriage should be between a man and a woman, they can continue to believe that. That is their right.’ Today’s move will be seen as an attempt to heal rifts over gay marriage. Protections in the Act that exist for critics of 'sexual orientation' will be updated to cover same-sex marriage, it is understood . The Government has also suggested it would consider measures to address concerns that teachers might have to promote same-sex marriage despite conscientious objections. Veteran Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh, said on the ConservativeHome website that same-sex civil marriage had done ‘irreparable damage’ to Tory electoral prospects. ‘Some of the damage can be healed by ensuring there are adequate protections for conscientious objectors, especially chaplains, teachers, and registrars,’ he said.","Culture Secretary Maria Miller said to be about to change Public Order Act .

The grandmother of a 13-year-old girl at the center of a battle to turn off her life-support machine said she is devastated because the last words spoken to the terrified teenager were hers, saying everything would be OK. Sandra Chatman, a nurse, said she held Jahi McMath’s hand as she suffered complications following a routine tonsil operation and reassured her that the doctors knew what they were doing. But just minutes later Jahi’s heart stopped and caused so much brain damage that those same doctors now want to turn off the ventilator that keeps her alive. Distraught: Sandra Chatman with pictures of her and granddaughter Jahi . Mrs Chatman, who works at a different hospital to where her granddaughter is being treated, said that the memory had left her distraught and destroyed the trust she had in the medical profession. 'She was so frightened,' a visibly moved Mrs Chatman said from her home just a few miles from where Jahi remained in intensive care at Children’s Hospital in Oakland, California. 'I was with her [when] the complications began, when the blood started to come out of her mouth. I was the one holding her hand and reassuring her that everything was going to be OK.' 'She said ‘'Grandma this hurt so bad"" and I said everything would work out and it hasn’t. 'That is the devastating part. I feel so bad because Jahi was so scared. I feel so bad because I think Jahi, the sweetest girl in the world, suffered so badly.' Mrs Chatman, 50, a grandmother-of-four, said that when the complications began she told the nurse to get a doctor, but claimed that no one took her seriously enough. Devastated: Sandra, a nurse, was trying to reassure Jahi when the teenager went into cardiac arrest . Fight: Jahi's family are fighting to keep the 13-year-old on life support . She said that it was only when she noticed that Jahi’s vital signs were slipping away and she shouted across the intensive care unit that any proper action was taken. By then it was too late for a crash team to resuscitate her in time to stop devastating brain damage – damage so severe that the hospital wants to turn off her life support machine because it claims there is no chance of her recovering. Mrs Chatman, who along with Jahi’s other relatives are fighting the move because they believe she can still recover, said the treatment by the hospital had destroyed her faith in the medical profession. 'I really trusted the doctors,' she said. 'I held her hand and said so. I am a nurse. I reassure and encourage people every day. That’s my job. I’ll never be able to reassure anyone ever again.' She said that she had been appalled by the behavior of the doctors at the hospital who she alleges have been 'heartless' in their treatment of the family. She said a few days after her daughter’s complications the hospital told them the only option was to contact the coroner. But when the family asked for a second opinion, she claims the hospital’s Chief of Pediatrics Dr David Durand was brutal in his reply. 'We asked for a second opinion and Dr David Durand came in and said ""What don’t you understand? She is dead, dead, dead"".' Memories: Sandra with Jahi, far right, at the wedding of the teenager's mother . 'I couldn’t believe how heartless they were. If that happened in my hospital I would be so upset and embarrassed. 'That is when we got an attorney involved. Now all we want is to be free of Children’s Hospital so that we can take her to a hospital that will care for her. 'We want to be able to say that we tried everything we could for her. We are not crazy people looking for a miracle. 'I am a nurse. I do believe the body has an amazing ability to heal itself. But these doctors are used to playing God and they are not used to people questioning their opinion.' Mrs Chatman’s comments came as the hospital and family remain in legal stalemate, each accusing the other of misinformation. The relatives' attorney Chris Dolan claims that the hospital is blocking their attempts to transfer Jahi to another facility, while hospital spokesman Sam Singer said that the family had not fulfilled any statutory requirements for the move. All that is known is that arrangements have to be made before a court injunction runs out at 5pm next Tuesday or the hospital can switch off the life support machine. The wrangling has left Mrs Chatman emotionally exhausted. 'All my tears have gone because I have cried so much,' she said. 'I am just in defense mode now. We have to take it day by day. We are a normal family. People don’t die early in our family.'","Sandra Chatman claims hospital has been heartless .

'I am just thanking God and everyone who has supported us. I am going to fight with everything I have got,' Winkfield said Monday . 'We have a doctor in CA who will be by . her side, door- to-door throughout transfer to NYC,' a representative . from Jahi's family said at a press conference outside Children's . Hospital of Oakland. 'We . have also contracted an air ambulance that has agreed to take her from . door to door. We have a doctor who will be by her side throughout this . transfer,' he said. 'We need to get her to a hospital that wants to treat her. We are not just crazy people hoping for a miracle. We have doctors who agree with our stand.' Sealey, a 27-yaer-old scientific recruiter said they're hoping the hospital will budge on its hard line stance against helping Jahi be transferred. 'I think that we are very, very close if the hospital will co-operate.' The news comes despite doctors and previous judges agreeing that there is no way to bring the legally dead teen back. Struggle: Jahi's family is pitted against a hospital they've called uncaring in their struggle to keep the brain dead teen hooked to life support. Here, Children's Hospital of Oakland spokesman Sam Singer updates reporters on Jahi's condition December 30. Doctors contend she has no possibility of ever waking up . 'Jahi is moving when her mother speaks . and when her mother touches her. We have videoed this and produced it . to the hospital’s attorney,' Sealey said. 'We have a pediatrician that . has seen Jahi and sworn that she is not dead. The family has located a . licensed facility in the state of New York that has agreed to take . Jahi.' Winkfield hugged Sealey and cried 'thank God' outside the hospital after hearing the court had extended the injunction . Sealey said the family took video of Jahi responding when her mother touched and talked to her. He also said a pediatrician examined her and said she was not dead. But hospital spokesman Sam Singer said the girl's movements are involuntary muscle movements that in no way signal someone is alive, according to the Bay Area's ABC7 reporter Laura Anthony. Regardless of the chances, Jahi's mother held out hope and tried to relish the moments following Monday's temporary victory and called the hospital's treatment of the issue 'disgusting.' 'By the Grace of God she is still living and moving,' she said. World is watching: Here, Omari Sealey greets well-wishers Frank Somerville and his 9-year-old daughter Callie at Monday's emotional press event . Precautions: Officials saw to it that the door to the Children's Hospital of Oakland was barricaded Monday in preparation for Jahi's family's press conference . 'Today was the most stressful day of my life,' she said with tears in her eyes. 'No mother wants to be told the date and the time when their child is going to die.' Christopher Dolan, the family's attorney, first took to Twitter to announce the family had won the temporary injunction: . 'We have extension of TRO until January 7:00 thank you Jesus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' Dolan said previously that the family could ask Grillo for more time or file a federal appeal. Dolan said Monday: 'This child was sitting on death row until today. 'They (the hospital) were hell bent on ending this child’s life today and the court stopped them. A piece of paper has saved her from extinction. 'On that basis this is a victory. But the family should not have to fight.' Jahi’s grandmother Sandra Chatman, a nurse,  said: 'I believe that Jahi can recover. We need to look at all options to make sure that she can recover.' Mother Nailah added: 'We are just happy that the court agreed with us. I think that my daughter is alive.' Jahi underwent a tonsillectomy at the hospital on December 9 to treat sleep apnea and other issues. After . she awoke from the operation, her family said, she started bleeding . heavily and went into cardiac arrest. She was declared brain dead three . days later. The family said on its fundraising website that it had raised more than $25,000 for a possible transfer.

Bill de Blasio was sworn in as the 109th mayor of New York City early on Wednesday morning, becoming the first Democrat to occupy City Hall in more than two decades while vowing to pursue a sweeping liberal agenda for the nation's largest city. The new mayor was elected two months ago by a record margin on the promise of being a sharp break from Michael Bloomberg, who left office on Tuesday afternoon after 12 years that reshaped New York, making it one of the nation's safest and most prosperous big cities but also one that has become increasingly stratified between the very rich and the working class. De Blasio took the oath of office moments after midnight at his modest Park Slope, Brooklyn home. His inauguration will be celebrated on a far grander scale at noon Wednesday on the steps of City Hall when he takes the oath again, which will be administered by former President Bill Clinton.

A sea of flashing cameras and thunderous applause greeted Bloomberg as he left, walking over to catch the subway home to the Upper East Side, sitting among the locals who were happy to express their gratitude.

Outgoing mayor Michael Bloomberg walks though the crowd outside City Hall as he leaves for last time as Mayor of New York, on New Year's Eve in New York, December 31, 2013 . A new report says Bloomberg - who, accoding to Forbes, is worth $27 million - spent $650 million of his own fortune on New York City over the course of three terms in office. Sorting through public documents, philanthropy databases and other records, the New York Times says Bloomberg spent about $62,400 in 12 years for weekly cleanings of two large saltwater fish tanks in City Hall. He also made $23 million in campaign donations and has given a cool $30 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art since 2002. Bloomberg famously took a $1 annual salary as mayor. Bloomberg issued a series of tweets marking his last day, the first noting his resolve to resurrect a city still wounded by the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks when he first took office. 'On my first day in office, I visited the World Trade Center site and vowed NYC would rebuild stronger than ever. Today I can say we have,' he tweeted. In another tweet, Bloomberg thanked his staff and all city employees, saying, 'we’ve made every day count for NYC'.

Finally, he tweeted: 'Thank you, New Yorkers, for the honor and privilege of serving you for these past 12 years.' On Tuesday morning, the mayor hosted his 13th and final interfaith prayer breakfast at the New York Public Library. Bloomberg used his final speech as mayor to thank religious leaders for helping New Yorkers in need and to praise the city’s diversity. 'I have always been envious of you,' he said at an interfaith breakfast at the New York Public Library. 'Because you work at the real level where the real problems are. Big numbers are easy to deal with. It’s much tougher when you deal one on one, looking at a person right in the eye who has a problem.' Bloomberg turned more lighthearted when he spoke about the clock winding down on his tenure. 'As you may know, I’ve been mayor now for 11 years, 364 days and about nine hours, but who’s counting?' he said. He also cited remarks by Pope Francis about the importance of cities, then quipped, 'The fact that a Jewish kid can quote the Pope in a secular building built by Protestants in front of Hindu, Muslim and Sikh leaders really says all you need to know about New York City.'

'It’s been a very rewarding 12 years, I’ll look back on it for the rest of my life and I’ll be able to say to my kids ‘your father tried to do something to make your life and you’re children’s better,'' said the mayor. His final 48 hours in office included the unveiling of his official City Hall portrait and the signing of legislation banning plastic foam food containers and adding e-cigarettes to the indoor smoking ban.

While we are often told of the benefits of 'coming clean', refusing to apologise can actually make people feel better than those who say sorry, according to a new study. Scientists have found that the feelings of empowerment that come with refusing to make amends for a mistake can outweigh feelings of relief experienced when saying sorry. Researchers Tyler G. Okimoto, Michael Wenzel and Kyli Hedrick, from the University of Queensland, surveyed 228 Americans and asked them to remember a time they . had done something wrong. Refusing to apologise can actually make people feel better than those who say sorry, according to a new study . While most people remembered relatively trivial . offenses, some remembered serious offences, including crimes such as . theft, NPR reports. The team then asked the subjects whether they had said sorry, or . made a decision not to apologise even though they knew they were in the . wrong. Scientists have found that the feelings of empowerment that come with refusing to make amends for a mistake, can outweigh feelings of relief that come with saying sorry . They also split the group at random - instructing some to write an email where they apologised for their actions, or compose an . email refusing to say sorry. When faced with making a difficult life decision, many of us can spend hours agonising over what to do. But new research has discovered that this is perhaps not the best way to find a solution. Instead, we should trust our intuition and make a quick decision. Researchers in Portugal found that decisions made on the spur of the moment are just as good as when we take our time. They discovered that when rats were challenged with a series of perceptual decision problems, their performance was just as good when they decided rapidly as when they took a much longer time to respond. In both cases, Okimoto said, refusing to apologise provided . psychological benefits. The same thing also happened when people were asked to imagine doing . something wrong, and then imagine apologising or refusing to apologise. The research group said it could give an explanation as to why  people are so often . reluctant to say sorry. Okimoto said when we refuse to apologise, it actually makes us feel more empowered. He said: 'That power and control seems to translate into greater feelings of self-worth.' He added: 'We do find that apologies do make apologisers feel better, but the . interesting thing is that refusals to apologise also make people feel . better and, in fact, in some cases it makes them feel better than an . apology would have.'","'Empowerment' from refusing to say sorry can outweigh relief of apologising .

"By . Mia De Graaf . PUBLISHED: . 05:28 EST, 30 December 2013 . Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham has blasted the privatisation as 'cost-cutting at its crudest' Thousands have been forced to wait more than two hours to get to hospital after an ambulance service was taken over by a private bus company to cut costs. The controversial privatisation has seen Arriva Transport Solutions receive more than 400 complaints in just six months of running the fleet in Greater Manchester - more than double the original service. And one grieving daughter blames the service for the death of her mother - who died of a heart attack after waiting more than two hours before resorting to a taxi. The conflict is the latest in a series of attacks on privatisation deals across the country, which was branded 'cost-cutting at its crudest'. The contract, which Arriva won after undercutting the North West Ambulance Service by £3.5million, stipulates 80 per cent of patients should be collected within 60 minutes, and 90 per cent within 90 minutes. This year, Arriva Passengers Ltd also took over South West Ambulance Services Trust in Gloucestershire. The nation's largest private ambulance firm, Medical Services Ltd, a Danish company, operates in London, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and North West England. It is a lucrative business as the company's accounts show a turnover of £29m, gross profits of £7m, and operating profits of £577,000 since the takeover. A Freedom of Information request shows that 8,460 patients waited for more than two hours for Arriva to pick them up between April and September. Since April 1, almost 250 complained they waited more than 90 minutes for the 'Ambuline' service, while 70 did not receive transport at all. Others blasted the newly-privatised service for lack of information, poor medical care, and the drivers' attitudes. Further freedom of Information requests, submitted by Labour, revealed increases on spending by three English ambulance services on private contractors in the last two years. The biggest rise in spending was in London which saw a tenfold increase in the amount spent increase from £400,000 in 2010/11 to £4.2million in 2012/13. South East Coast Ambulance service spent £7.3million up from £1.9million in 2010/11 while in Yorkshire the spend on private contractors went up from £500,000 to £1.8million. Arriva Transport Solutions was appointed to provide non-emergency medical journeys across the region from April. Any patient that calls 999 with a condition that is not life-threatening or desperately urgent is told to expect an Ambuline service. It undercut the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS), an NHS trust, by £3.5million to secure the deal. Caroline Connelly (right) and her mother Annette, who died last month. Caroline blames non-emergency medical transport service run by bus firm Arriva for contributing to her death . Figures, . obtained using Freedom of Information laws, show Arriva received 411 . complaints in its first six months of running the service in Greater . Manchester. Complaints . peaked at almost 150 in April, dropping to 89 in May, 58 in June, 51 in . July, 45 in August, 21 in September, and 32 in October. Lucy Powell, MP for Manchester Central, said: 'Because of the decision to put profit ahead of patients, hundreds of people are not getting the treatment they deserve. 'Arriva owes all those affected an apology and if the service is not urgently improved, then it should lose its contract.' A spokesman for Blackpool Clinical Commissioning Group, which awards contracts for ambulance transport in the north west, said bosses are ‘happy’ with how the Arriva contract is going. One patient's family slammed their service as a shambles after a series of delays taking her to hospital. Annette Connelly, 56, suffered a heart attack in March - which her daughter, Caroline, partly blames on the stress caused by poor service. Mrs Connelly, a diabetic, had been travelling from her home on in Manchester to have kidney dialysis at Manchester Royal Infirmary. On five out of six occasions in the first week, the company or the hospital ordered her a taxi because drivers were not available - while she was twice left for more than two hours with other frail patients because Arriva hadn't turned up. On April 4, Mrs Connelly was taken to hospital by ambulance after suffering a diabetic fit shortly after arriving home hours late. Days later she was admitted to hospital after suffering a heart attack - before passing away there after a second heart attack on April 17. Caroline, 28, blames Arriva for the ordeal. She said: 'I think that it was the beginning of the end. It's not that my mum wasn't ill before, but if it wasn't for Arriva and them setting off that catalogue of events, I believe there would be a chance that she would still be here today.' ATSL (Arriva Transport Solutions) has apologised to Mrs Connelly's family - and said it has investigated and addressed teething problems experienced in the early part of the contract. Dennis Hajdukiewicz, head of Greater Manchester for ATSL, said: 'I offer my sincere condolences to Ms Connelly and her family at this very difficult time. 'Ensuring that we deliver a safe and reliable service to our patients is our highest priority and as such I am very sorry to hear about Mrs Connelly's experiences. We have undertaken a full investigation to find out exactly how and why Mrs Connelly experienced such unacceptable delays, so that we can identify any actions that we need to take, to help avoid a repeat of this in the future. 'We are committed to ensuring that patients across Greater Manchester receive the very highest quality non-emergency patient transport service.' 'We have been liaising with Ms Connelly regarding our investigation, and will provide the full findings and any resulting actions, in writing to her, as she has requested.' Attacking the private deals across the UK as 'cost-cutting at . its crudest', shadow health secretary Andy Burnham blasted Jeremy Hunt . for putting patient safety at risk. He . said: 'It is proof that the Coalition sees no limits on privatisation . in the NHS. They are driving the private sector into the public core of . the NHS, offering up essential emergency provision to the lowest bidder. 'Whistleblowers . have contacted Labour with concerns that even the most serious 999 . calls are being handled by private ambulances without properly trained . staff and equipment. 'This . is cost-cutting privatisation at its crudest, with a real risk that . patient safety will be compromised. Jeremy Hunt must provide urgent . assurances about the quality and safety of these private services.' Earlier this year, the Care Quality . Commission blasted Arriva's poor staff training, staff shortages and . failing to keep records of whether vehicles were properly cleaned to . avoid infection.","8,460 patients forced to wait more than two hours by Arriva Transport Solutions' ambulance service in Greater Manchester .

'I have no explanation as to what he was doing there - maybe he was fishing for oil cans? 'It was really misty and so we didnâ€™t see many birds but seeing C3PO fishing instead made our morning.' C3PO was played by British actor Anthony Daniels in all six Star Wars films, which began with Episode 4: A New Hope in 1977. Daniels and Kenny Baker, who played R2D2, are the only two actors to appear in each film.

Guilty: Nathaniel Flynn is facing life in jail after admitting murdering his 84-year-old grandmother and trying to kill a nine-year-old boy . A cannabis user who murdered his 84-year-old grandmother, stabbing her 50 times as she lay in her bed, and then attempted to kill a nine-year-old boy, has been sentenced to life in prison. A judge today told Nathaniel Flynn, 27, that he will face at least 24 years behind bars as he passed a life sentence at Bradford Crown Court. Mr Justice Keith said the most likely explanation for why he killed retired teacher Louisa Denby was that 'she just got on your nerves'. Flynn admitted killing Ms Denby at their home in Shipley, West Yorkshire, in July, and stabbing Jason D’Arcy in a nearby skate park later the same day. The court heard that Jason suffered a shallow wound to his chest and a much more serious injury to his arm as he tried to defend himself. The judge heard that three psychiatrists found he had no diagnosable mental illness but said he had been influenced by his heavy, 'entrenched' use of cannabis and other drugs. Speaking after Flynn pleaded guilty earlier this month, police officers said they had no idea what drove Flynn to commit the 'brutal and frenzied' attacks. Julian Briggs, from CPS Yorkshire and . Humberside’s Complex Casework Unit, said: 'This defendant is responsible . for two vicious and unprovoked attacks. 'It has not been possible to establish what drove Flynn to commit these awful crimes. 'He . has now admitted his responsibility and pleaded guilty to charges of . murder and attempted murder. 'We hope this brings some measure of comfort . to the families of both victims.' Flynn, . from Shipley, was due to go on trial two weeks ago, but admitted the . charges at Bradford Crown Court on December 3. Flanked by four prison officers in the dock, he wore a . blue shirt and jeans and was joined by members of his family. He showed no emotion as he confessed to murdering his grandmother, before stabbing the terrified schoolboy who had been playing nearby.

Branden ‘The Real Soulja Boy’ Mattier, 23, from Boston, claims the Massachusetts State Police set him up ‘through police misconduct’ when they charged him last year with trying to scam more than $2million from The One Fund. The South End lyricist is representing himself and seeking $100,000 in damages in the civil suit filed December 23, the Boston Herald reported. Facing the music: Branden Mattier (center) was hit with multiple charges after being accused of trying to scam The One Fund . The suit comes after both Mr Mattier and brother Domunique Grice, 28, were accused by the MSP of trying to con almost $2.2million from the fund after filing a claim using the name of a dead aunt under the guise of her losing her legs in the attack. The duo even attended a dinner for victims and their families, the Herald noted. In a scene straight of a movie, police teamed up with FedEx to snag the brothers by having an undercover trooper dress as a FedEx employee July 2 to hand deliver the fake check. FedEx is also named as a defendant in the misconduct suit. They had scheduled an appointment to test drive a Mercedes Benz later that afternoon in anticipation of their $2.194million bounty, they instead took a ride to the local state police barracks.

Fierce: Police have been forced to pay out compensation to four students bitten by riot dogs in a crackdown on a student party in Leeds. (File picture) A former university student bitten in the testicles by a police dog is one of four paid more than £75,000 compensation after authorities cracked down on a noisy student party. West Yorkshire Police made an out-of-court settlement averaging almost £19,000 each to the four former students bitten by the dogs as heavily armed riot police moved in. One of the organisers of the party said it was proof the police reaction was heavy-handed. But the force, despite admitting the compensation claims were 'unlikely to be successfully defended', nevertheless continued to defend its officers' actions. Riot police were called to the house party in the Hyde Park area of Leeds, West Yorkshire, attended by hundreds of people, in May 2007 after reports that it was out of control. It is claimed that orders to the partygoers to disperse were ignored and missiles thrown at officers, prompting them to unleash the dogs to clear the crowds. Now the force has paid out a total of £75,725 and issued formal apologies to the victims. Will Hillier, now 27, was studying at Leeds Metropolitan University at the time and helped to organise the party. He admitted that the party had become too big but said the police reaction 'antagonised' the situation. 'The first thing a lot of people knew about what was going on was when they were being attacked,' he said. 'We heard that one guy had been bitten on his testicles. Another guy claimed he was attacked while trying to protect his girlfriend. 'The way it was handled by police exacerbated the problem.' Three arrests were made at the time . over alleged public order offences, but they are not thought to have . resulted in court prosecutions. Several formal complaints about the incident were investigated by police and found to be unsubstantiated. The force said settlements were made out of court because the compensation claims were 'unlikely to be successfully defended'. Mr Hillier added: 'I’m glad the police had paid out. It proves they were heavy-handed.' But Chief Superintendant Dave Oldroyd, commander of north-west Leeds division, defended his officers' actions. He said officers spent 90 minutes ordering the crowd to disperse, but were ignored. He said 'public order tactics' were used to clear the area after missiles were thrown at police. 'Out of a crowd of hundreds, four people were later paid compensation over police dog bite injuries,' he said. 'We have rightly apologised to those individuals but we make no apology for our overall response to a situation which, if allowed to run out of control, presented a genuine threat to public safety.'","Out-of-court settlements come after West Yorkshire Police admit the claims were 'unlikely to be successfully defended'

The father of a man killed in a car crash has died of a broken heart following his son's death, a court has heard. Lee Williams, 40, was in the passenger seat of best friend Darren Jarvis’ sports car when it crashed into a people carrier. The father-of-two had returned from a family holiday to Disneyland Paris less than 24 hours earlier and was due to go for a weekend break with his wife Sian and their two children. Mrs Williams told a court that her father-in-law John's fatal heart attack in June this year had been brought on by grief. Jarvis had lost control of his turbo . charged Nissan Skyline while driving at 71mph on an A-road just outside . Aberdare, south Wales, after taking Lee Williams for a drive. The 3.8 litre engine vehicle then crashed it into a people carrier carrying Jacek Stawski and his young son Thomas. Both Mr Williams and Mr Stawski, who was a father-of-two, died instantly. Jarvis was found guilty of two counts of . causing death by dangerous driving at his trial in Cardiff Crown Court . last month and was today jailed for four years. His trial heard that the . pair had met in the pub to discuss Jarvis's recent divorce, where Mr . Williams had 'one pint' and the defendant stuck to soft drinks. Jarvis was due to drop his friend off at . the town's Asda supermarket, when a couple of minutes around the corner . his sports car suddenly accelerated. Other . road users described the car as 'shooting off like a jet', its wheels . spinning wildly like the start of an 'American hot rod' race. Jarvis struggled to control the car as it spun sideways and into the path of Mr Stawski’s Citroen Xsara Picasso people carrier. Witness Paula Evans, who was among the first on the scene, described the bloody aftermath as 'horrific'. She told police in a victim impact statement: 'It was like something from a murder scene.' Jarvis was found having a seizure in the wreckage, while Mr Williams and Mr Stawski were dead. Four-year-old Thomas Stawski was alive - but found screaming in terror after witnessing the death of his father. His defence was that he suffered a fit while at the wheel, which had caused him to lose control of the vehicle. But Mr Justice Stewart said the evidence and the jury’s verdict proved otherwise. He said: 'You clearly did have your foot pressed hard against the accelerator... this was a deliberate act.' During . sentencing today, Judge Mr Justice SP Stewart said he had to take into . account that Jarvis’ actions had left four children fatherless and . caused 'irreparable damage' to a number of people’s lives. Lee Williams had met in the pub to discuss Jarvis's (above) recent divorce before the crash . In a victim impact statement Mrs Williams, said her 'perfect family life' had been cruelly stolen from her. 'We did everything together. My children idolised their dad,' she said. 'To say that what has happened has turned my life upside down would be an understatement.' Mrs Williams, who first met her husband in 1998, described how difficult and strange it was not to have her husband, whom she married in 2002, around the house. Mrs Williams detailed how her youngest . son, aged seven, regularly cries out for his daddy, while it felt as if . her eldest, aged 11, had had his childhood stolen from him as he felt . he 'had to be the man of the house'. She added: 'He’s taken on all the jobs that Lee used to do like mowing the lawn.' Mrs . Williams said that she has tried to escape the fog of grief surrounding . her home town in Aberdare by taking the boys to their holiday caravan . in west Wales, where they used to spend regular weekend breaks away as a . family. Pictured here is a Nissan Skyline similar to the one that was driven in the fatal crash . She said her husband was the sole breadwinner, earning about £500 per week. 'However, since his death she has been unable to find work and has to try and live off £220 per week in benefit instead. However, Mrs Williams wanted to express her thanks to the police and Crown Prosecution Service in ensuring justice had been served, as well as the support she had been given from friends and family. 'Lee was a hard working man who will never be forgotten,' she added. While sentencing, the High Court Judge also . noted Jarvis’ genuine remorse for causing the crash - which has left the . defendant feeling suicidal. Mr Justice Steward said: 'Nobody should underestimate the suffering that you have caused to others by what you did on that day. Darren Jarvis has been jailed for four years for causing death by dangerous driving - after a road traffic accident left Jacek Stawski and Lee Williams dead . 'Their lives and those of their children, family and friends have been gravely damaged. 'A prison sentence must be the inevitable result of your action. The question is for how long. 'Prison . will not bring back the deceased to their families. The sentence is not . meant to be, and indeed cannot be, a question of what a life is worth. 'However, I must take account of the mitigation. 'A mitigating factor is that you yourself were seriously injured in the accident. 'Medical evidence shows that your brain injury has caused cognitive and psychological difficulties. 'You have low mood anxiety and suicidal ideation. 'A . pre-sentence report said that you expressed genuine remorse for the . tragic consequences and feeling devastated for the families involved and . at one point stated ""I wish I’d died in the crash"".

After suffering the torment of losing their unborn child, Edward and Colleen Ogilvie today welcomed baby Martin - believed to be the first arrival of 2014. Weighing 4lb 7.5oz the newborn was delivered six weeks early at 12.01am after his mother Colleen Ogilvie suffered a complication during her pregnancy. The 38-year-old civil servant had been expecting twins. But in November, after being diagnosed with placenta previa, which causes the placenta to cover the opening of the womb, Mrs Ogilvie was rushed into hospital where doctors revealed she had lost one of her babies. Tiny Martin Ogilvie was born at 12.01am at St Johns Hospital in Livingston, Scotland. His parents Edward and Colleen believe he was the first newborn to arrive in 2014 . Martin was expected to arrive closer to his due date on February 10. But on New Years Eve, when first-time father Edward Ogilvie, 40, returned to the couple's West Lothian home after visiting his parents in Edinburgh, it became clear their son had no plans to wait another month. Mrs Ogilvie said she started to become concerned after noticing she was bleeding. 'Colleen was standing in the doorway of our house and she just said 'don't put the car away,' Mr Ogilvie said. 'We came in to the hospital at about 7.15pm. At that point, delivery hadn't been discussed. The newborn, weighing 4lb 7.5oz, arrived six weeks early after his mother suffered complications during her pregnancy . 'It was a bit touch and go, and then we were told he was going to be delivered. 'We've been in the hospital about five or six times recently, and the staff were just fantastic.' She added: 'The decision to deliver him was made about 11.15pm and then by the time everything was prepared it was 11.30pm and we knew we were going to have our baby. 'Because of the contractions and the bleeding, I was really nervous. You never know how it's going to go. 'When I began experiencing bleeding and contractions at home it was heavier than before so I was quite concerned.' Martin is believed to be the first baby born in the UK after the bells chimed at midnight. And his proud parents said they plan to make sure he knows all about his special arrival when he grows up. Mrs Ogilvie said: 'Its definitely a tale we'll be telling Martin - we are just both so glad he's here. 'I'm just totally stunned. We weren't expecting him to be so early. 'The nurses have been fantastic, before, during and afterwards. Nothing has been a problem. 'We are just so thrilled and thankful that he's here safe now.' The couple, who have been married for 10 years, moved to Winchburgh from Edinburgh city centre when they decided to start a family. Mr Ogilvie said: 'I'm just speechless now that he's here. I'm more shocked than anything else. 'We were trying to get everything ready for his room and now he's here - it still feels like a dream because Colleen had been in and out of hospital.' Placenta previa can cause bleeding, which in turn can cause complications in pregnancy. The condition can result in mothers having to deliver early and if a woman is suffering placenta previa at the time of giving birth, she will have to have a cesarean section. Martin's arrival was all the more poignant for proud parents Edward and Colleen, after the couple suffered the loss of his twin in November. Mrs Ogilvie was rushed into hospital where doctors diagnosed her with placenta previa, which causes the placenta to grow over the opening of the womb .","Martin Ogilvie was born at 12.01am at St Johns Hospital in Livingstone .

Tripling tobacco taxes could prevent 200 million deaths worldwide and cut smoking by a third, a study has claimed. Researchers say the tax hike would deter young people from starting to smoke, and encourage smokers to quit completely rather than just switch to a cheaper brand. In most high-income countries, up to 60 per cent of the price of a pack of cigarettes is tax - whereas in most low and middle-income countries, tax accounts for up to 40 per cent of the cost. Tripling tobacco taxes could prevent 200 million deaths worldwide and cut smoking by a third, a study has claimed . The research - carried out by Cancer Research UK - reviewed 63 studies on the causes and consequences of tobacco use in different countries. Study co-author Professor Sir Richard Peto said: 'The two certainties in life are death and taxes. We want higher tobacco taxes and fewer tobacco deaths. 'It would help children not to start, and it would help many adults to stop while there's still time. 'Globally, about half of all young men and one in 10 of all young women become smokers, and, particularly in developing countries, relatively few quit. Researchers say the tax hike would deter young people from starting to smoke, and encourage smokers to quite completely rather than just switch to a cheaper brand . 'If they keep smoking, about half will be killed by it, but if they stop before 40, they'll reduce their risk of dying from tobacco by 90 per cent.' He added: 'The international tobacco industry makes about £30 billion in profits each year - that's a profit of approximately £6,000 per death from smoking.' Research . has shown that a 50 per cent higher inflation-adjusted price for . cigarettes reduces tobacco consumption by about a fifth, with the . biggest impact on the young and poor. As well as cutting consumption by a third, tripling tobacco taxes would also increase global government revenues from tobacco by a third, from £180 billion a year to £240 billion, said the researchers. In the European Union, a doubling of cigarette prices would prevent 100,000 deaths a year in the under 70s, they added. The findings are reported in the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: 'Worldwide, around half a billion children and adults under the age of 35 are already - or soon will be - smokers, and many will be hooked on tobacco for life.

A disabled two-year-old has been left housebound after thieves stole hundreds of pounds worth of specialist equipment from her parents’ car days before Christmas. Audrey Frantzich cannot walk, talk or eat due to a rare genetic condition and needs an oxygen supply and expensive mobility equipment to help her live. She has to be fed milk through a tube in her stomach and relies on specialist aids just to help her sit up. Condition: The two year old suffers from a rare genetic condition which means she cannot sit up, walk or talk . Now her parents Louise, 28, and Herman, 24, are unable to take her out after thieves stole their car containing her special car seat, buggy, chair and oxygen canister. The culprits later abandoned the car but kept the equipment – and even the vehicle’s disabled badge. They also held on to the family’s sat nav and a camera full of irreplaceable photographs charting Audrey’s life. Mrs Frantzich said the Rover was stolen on Saturday from the garage attached to the family’s bungalow in Baildon, West Yorkshire. She said: ‘We feel really shocked and upset that people would do that, especially around Christmas time. ‘When they saw the oxygen and the disabled badge in the car, they would have had an idea. How would they feel if it was their disabled child who was left without? Stolen: Parents Louise, 28, and Herman, 24, (pictured) discovered that their Rover Streetwise had been stolen . ‘It’s had a huge impact on our life over Christmas. We wanted to go out and do things with Audrey, but we’ve not been able to because the buggy we would have put her in was stolen.’ Audrey’s condition means that she has spinal problems, hearing aids in each ear, a cleft palate and suffers from reflux, where acid from the stomach leaks into the gullet. She cannot sit up properly and finds it hard to hold her head upright, meaning she needs a special seat or buggy to support her. Audrey has to have constant medical attention, so the stolen equipment was vital for her travel to hospital appointments. Her parents estimate they have lost £350 worth of equipment, not including the oxygen canister which was provided by the NHS. Her mother added: ‘They’ve even taken the fleece blanket I bought to keep her warm when we go out. The rare genetic condition has a range of symptoms. The disorder means people have the entire 9th chromosome three times rather than twice in some cells of the body. Sufferers can have congenital heart defects as well as skull and other physical abnormalities . It is caused by problems when reproductive cells divide early in a pregnancy.

Appointment: The car and equipment is needed so Audrey can be taken to a hospital appointment at Bradford Royal Infirmary on Friday . ‘It’s . going to be a struggle getting to hospital appointments without . everything that has been stolen and we’ll even struggle to park because . the disabled badge has gone.’ Audrey’s great-grandmother Barbara Seed, 78, added: ‘How can people be so cruel? Audrey’s such a happy and lovely little soul.’ Police . recovered the car on the same day that it was stolen and arrested three . people, but the items were not in it or found during a search of the . suspects’ homes.

Men who can't function without an early morning coffee kick can now get it as they're having a shave. A new product has added caffeine to normal shaving cream. It is absorbed by the skin – and an energy boost can be felt within five minutes, even before you've put your trousers on. The effect of the product is thought to set in when a man uses the matching aftershave. Men who normally head to the kitchen for a cup of coffee in the morning could now kick start their day in the bathroom, thanks to a new caffeinated shaving cream . An 85g bottle of the cream contains around 50mg of caffeine which is about the same level as a fizzy drink such as Coca Cola. It also helps to reduce red patches and blemishes on the skin. The bizarre cosmetic, dubbed the Caffeinated Shaving Cream, was invented by Stan Ades, 43, after he spotted the gap in the market. Stan, who is from San Francisco, said: 'There is lots of innovation on things like razors but not that much for shaving creams. 'I saw that there was a gap in the market and I knew that caffeine is a vasoconstrictor and an antioxidant that helps reduce redness and keeps skin feeling healthy. 'I spoke to a chemist and we infused caffeine into a shaving cream and not only does it help the skin, but it is actually absorbed into the body. 'It probably wouldn't be as effective as a cup of coffee and is more like the effect given from a can of fizzy drink, but you can definitely feel it. 'There is about 50mg of caffeine in a bottle of the shaving cream and between 40 and 80mg in a cup of coffee. 'Although the shaving cream is made from caffeine derived from coffee beans it doesn't smell of coffee and instead has a peppermint oil scent. 'As it is just 85g it is a good size for travellers and can be taken on aeroplanes because it is within the flying restrictions.' The shaving cream costs around five pounds from an online shop.","Caffeine is absorbed by skin when a customer is having a shave .

The Pentagon announced Tuesday that three hard to transfer Chinese Uighur detainees are transferring out to Slovakia. The government captured 22 in 2001 in Afghanistan and soon realized they were not enemies, but had a difficult time finding them new homes. They could not be sent to China because the country has a long history of oppressing the ethnic group and the communist regime pressured one country to back out of a deal to accept them, the New York Times noted. Finally free: The final three Uighurs remaining at Guantanamo Bay have been freed . ‘The Department of Defense is announcing today the transfer of Yusef Abbas, Saidullah Khalik, and Hajiakbar Abdul Ghuper from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to the Government of Slovakia,’ Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement. ‘These three are the last ethnic Uighur Chinese nationals to be transferred… and are voluntarily resettling in Slovakia,’ he continued. The transfer of the three men to Slovakia marks a total of 11 detainees leaving the prison since last summer, including nine in December alone, the Times noted. 'The United States is grateful to the government of Slovakia for this humanitarian gesture and its willingness to support U.S. efforts to close the Guantánamo Bay detention facility,’ said Mr Kirby. Finally free: Chinese Uighur Guantanamo detainees, who at the time were cleared for release but had no country to go to, show a home-made note to visiting members of the media in 2009 . The Uighurs were picked up shortly after the American invasion of Afghanistan on suspicion they had received weapons training and were allied with Al Qaeda. American suspicions were proven wrong within a few months, but there was no where they could go. There are now 155 detainees left in . Guantanamo, and roughly half of them are already approved for transfers – . most are Yemeni, according to the Times. ‘All 22 Uighurs from Guantánamo now have been resettled to six different countries, and these three resettlements are an important step in implementing President Obama’s directive to close the Guantánamo detention facility,’ Mr Sloan told the Times. Efforts to close the facility were renewed after President Obama appointed Cliff Sloan earlier this year as the envoy tasked with reducing headcount at the terror prison. Uighurs were the most difficult prisoners to move, the Times explained, because of the complications surrounding their leaving Guantanamo Bay. ‘From the beginning, we knew that one test of our determination to close Guantánamo would be measured by what happened to the Uighurs,’ former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig told the Times. Crackdown: Armed Chinese soldiers march on patrol in 2009 as an Uighur man crosses the street in Urumqi . ‘That the last of the Uighurs has now left Guantánamo is an important milestone,’ he added. ‘They didn’t belong there in the first place.’ The government agreed, but removing them took time. They could not be sent back to China because of humanitarian concerns stemming from Chinese crackdowns on unrest in their region. Plans to settle them in 2009 in Northern Virginia were met with stiff resistance from Congress and eventually dropped. Agreements reached with Palau, the Maldives and El Salvador were rejected by the prisoners themselves. The population is slowly dropping: There are now 155 detainees remaining at the terror prison . Costa Rica agreed to take the remaining three, which they accepted, but those plans were scuttled when China pressured the Central American country to withdraw the offer. They finally agreed on Slovakia, and the deal was announced this week. The other Uighur detainees accepted offers to go to Bermuda, El Salvador, Palau and Switzerland. Guantanamo Bay was thrust back into the spotlight after retired Major General Michael Lenhert called for its closure in a Detroit Free-Press op-ed and a series of media appearances. President Obama made closing the base one of his primary targets during the 2008 presidential election. His efforts to do so languished until recently. He said in a statement issued Thursday after signing the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act that he is optimistic about the prospects of the prison closing. ‘I am encouraged that this act provides the executive greater flexibility to transfer Guantánamo detainees abroad, and look forward to working with the Congress to take the additional steps needed to close the facility.’","A total of 22 were apprehended in 2001 in Afghanistan .

Jerri Lee gave two-month-old daughter Milan a bottle of organic milk she had bought on the way home from work. But within moments the baby was sick and then remained ill for two days. Photographer and model Miss Lee checked the bottle as Milan had never been sick before and had been healthy since she was born. To her horror she found that the milk she had just given her was from a box of six small bottles whose sell-by date had expired ten months earlier. Miss Lee, who has appeared in The Only Way is Essex, said: ‘You don’t know what could have been in that bottle. ‘They expire for a reason – who knows what harm it could have done? She is not a sicky baby but she was sick continuously over a 48 hour period.

An enormous black hole has opened up in the pension funds of Britain’s leading companies since the financial crisis, grim figures showed yesterday. Final salary company pension schemes in the FTSE 100 index of blue chip firms swung from a surplus of £14billion at the end of 2008 to a deficit of £57billion at the end of 2013, according to the report. The analysis, by pension experts Jardine Lloyd Thompson, showed that the shortfall for all private sector final salary schemes now stands at £150billion. An enormous black hole has opened up in the pension funds of Britain's leading companies since the financial crisis, grim figures showed yesterday . The dramatic deterioration in the health of company pension schemes has come despite the stock market soaring 52 per cent since the end of 2008 including a rise of more than 14 per cent in 2013.Shares typically make up around 35 per cent of pension fund portfolios with the rest split between government bonds, property and other assets. Experts warned that firms will now be forced to pump more money into the pension schemes to make-up the shortfall - depriving them of cash for investment crucial to the economic recovery. Pensions expert Ros Altmann, a former government adviser, said: ‘It is difficult for corporate UK. ‘Companies with pension deficits will be unable to invest so much in their business because they have to put more money into their pension schemes. ‘It gives the UK a big handicap relative to other countries because the deficits here are higher than they are in Europe for example. ‘It does also demonstrate just how expensive it is to deliver a decent pension. Part of the issue is that people are living longer.’ Pension funds have big portfolios of shares, government bonds and property and other assets.Shortfalls appear when these investments are not sufficient to cover their future commitments to retired employees. Record low interest rates of 0.5 per cent and the Bank of England¿s £375billion money-printing programme have left large holes in company pension funds by driving down returns on government bonds . Firms are trying to plug the gaps by paying in extra or insisting on bigger contributions from staff. But record low interest rates of 0.5 per cent and the Bank of England’s £375billion money-printing programme have left large holes in company pension funds by driving down returns on government bonds. Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, has said that firms with final salary schemes ‘are being clouted’ by quantitative easing in particular. The prospect of higher inflation - which determines how much firms pay out to former employees throughout their retirement - has also put a strain on pension funds at a time when people are living longer. Many firms have now closed their final salary, or defined benefit, pension schemes because they are too expensive even after increased contributions from staff. Charles Cowling, director of JLT Employee Benefits, said: ‘2013 has proved to be a tough year for UK defined benefit pension schemes. Deficit levels remain stubbornly high despite strong equity markets and significant cash contributions from employers. ‘In the last five years, since the financial crisis, the equity market has performed strongly with the FTSE 100 up 52 per cent , but for pension schemes there has been no such cheer with the total deficit in the pension schemes of FTSE 100 companies up by £71billion over the same period. ‘What will 2014 bring? Potentially more of the same.’","FTSE 100 index of blue chip firms swung .

Apprentice: Prince Andrew, who never went to university and instead trained as a Navy pilot, says university is not an automatic route to a job . Prince Andrew says vocational courses should be taken more seriously, claiming many graduates are unprepared for the world of work. University should be regarded only as the ‘icing on the cake’ for people entering the jobs market, not an automatic route to a job, he said. The Duke of York added he believed the government’s expansion of University Technical  Colleges (UTCs) – which focus on practical learning and have close links with business – would give students an advantage over teenagers who do A-levels and then enter higher education. He said: ‘Coming out of university there’s a tendency to believe that you are trained as well as educated, which is not actually true.’ He added: ‘Choosing an apprenticeship path and doing a foundation degree and then going on to university, you will always have the advantage over many of your university colleagues because you have earned your spurs in the business world before going to university.’ ‘I didn’t go to university. I went straight to the Navy and did an apprenticeship as a pilot.  University is the icing on the cake rather than a route to market,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. The Duke has been promoting apprenticeships after giving up his role as the UK’s trade ambassador. This followed scandals including his friendships with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and Colonel Gaddafi’s son Saif al-Islam. He launched the Duke of York awards last year,  presented for excellence in technical education. UTCs were introduced under Labour but are expanding under the Coalition. Plans for 40 new colleges were announced in October. Pupils study for high-level practical qualifications in areas such as catering, healthcare and construction, and do GCSEs and A-levels like maths, English and sciences. 'Educated but untrained': The Duke of York said that many graduates come out of university believing that they are ready for work, but in fact they are not yet well equipped for a role in industry .

"By . Laura Collins In Denver . PUBLISHED: . 13:12 EST, 31 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:10 EST, 31 December 2013 . One of Denver’s most publicized celebrations of the legalization of the sale of recreational marijuana has been cancelled, just hours before the New Year brings an end to the state of Colorado's prohibition of the drug. The City of Denver took the extraordinary step of hand-delivering a letter threatening to rescind the liquor license of the downtown venue at which the party, dubbed Cannabition, was due to be staged. The letter also threatened legal action against all sponsors and participants in the all-day party, planned by cannabis tourism company 420tours. Cancelled: Party organizer Matt Brown had planned to hold a celebration of the new rules on marijuana . The move serves as a warning shot for any who view the New Year and the new law as heralding a free-for-all for public cannabis consumption. In a statement to MailOnline, 420tours founder and party organizer Matt Brown said: ‘It is unfortunate that the City of Denver has chosen to take such a hardline stance against the idea of adults assembling to legally celebrate the unprecedented milestone represented by Amendment 64.’ Cannabition had been intended as the major organized celebration of the historic legal change. Organizers had hoped to stage the party at the city’s NORAD Dance Club but at 4pm on Friday afternoon Denver Department of Excise and Licenses delivered a letter to club owners. The letter stated: ‘We … dissuade you from hosting the event; however, if you go forward, we will exercise any and all options available to the City of Denver to halt the event and hold the business owners responsible for violations of law. ‘We are also ready to hold individual attendees responsible for violations of City ordinances prohibiting public consumption of marijuana.’ On Monday afternoon, after much argument and negotiation, Mr Brown and the club owners admitted defeat. Barred: An all-day party, due to be held at Norad dance bar, has been shut down . New era: Colorado marijuana growing facilities and dispensaries have been preparing for the new rules, with the introduction of marijuana-infused drinks . Munchies: Edible marijuana products are also being introduced in the state . It is the clearest sign yet that the . City of Denver, under statewide and even worldwide scrutiny, is . determined that the licensed sale of marijuana on January 1 should not . be confused with a free-for-all in public consumption of the drug. But it is a bitter blow for Mr Brown, who said it is too late to find another venue for the highly publicized event. He said: 'It is disingenuous for the city to tell the world that Colorado is open for business when such major questions remain regarding what happens after ""seed to sale"" when the whole point of amendment 64 is to responsibly consume cannabis without fear or retaliation.' In reality, though the sale of cannabis in licensed premises is legal, public consumption is not and Mr Brown is one of many pushing for the nascent legislation to go further and permit public consumption, as well as sale, albeit under controlled circumstances. But, with Colorado under intense public scrutiny, it is perhaps unsurprising that those tasked with enforcing the new law on January 1 should be concerned with just that and remain intolerant of any attempts to stretch it beyond the liberties so newly granted. Know the law: Michael Elliott, Executive Director of the Medical Marijuana Industry Group, points at some of the laws that will accompany the legalization of recreational marijuana on January 1 . Amendment 64 is the first legislation to set up a framework to regulate and tax sales of recreational marijuana. It not only decriminalizes it but establishes a legal market for the drug, licensing cultivation, processing and retail. It is illegal to give or sell marijuana to a minor. You must be over 21 to purchase the drug. Those from instate can buy up to 1 oz in any form. Anyone form out of state can buy half that quantity and must consume it before crossing state lines. Retailers . must be licensed and currently all such licenses have been issued to . growers and retailers already providing medical marijuana which has been . legally available in Colorado for a decade. Recreational . marijuana will be taxed at 15 per cent excise and 10 per cent sales tax – . higher than that sold to holders of a medical certificate, or ‘red . card.’ It is illegal to . drive high. An initial legal limit of five nanograms of THC per ml of . blood was set but it has been suggested that this could be waived for . drivers testing above this cutoff who show competence to drive. It is illegal to consume marijuana in public.","Cannabis tourism company had planned all-day party for January 1 .

It is the stark tale of a lone fisherman ostracised by his local villagers that is still considered to have changed the face of British opera and propelled its writer Benjamin Britten to fame. And in a special tribute to mark the composer's centenary, his famous opera Peter Grimes has finally been staged in the Suffolk fishing village of Aldeburgh which inspired the story 68 years ago. The large-scale production has never been performed in Aldeburgh before as there are no halls big enough to show it. But producers have managed to overcome that minor detail - by staging it right on the beach where most of the opera's action takes place. A thrilled sell-out crowd of 1,800 braved the chilly east coast wind to marvel at this ambitious staging of Britten's tragic story of a fisherman driven to destruction. A sea shanty: Cast members take to the stage during the first performance of 'Grimes on the Beach' in Aldeburgh . Quite a setting: Audience members arrive for the first performance of Peter Grimes which is being staged for the very first time on the beach which inspired the tale . Anniversary: The production falls on the centenary of its composer Benjamin Britten who wrote the opera 68 years ago . International opera director Tim Albery constructed a vast boardwalk on the shingle beach to act as a stage. He then decorated the set with a series of upturned fishing boats making it look as if a giant storm had swept these fragile craft up out of the water. Aldeburgh Music's chief executive Jonathan Reekie said that although Aldeburgh had inspired Britten's operatic masterpiece they had been unable to stage it until now because the sheer scale of the opera had meant that there was nowhere big enough in the small village to perform it. Mr Reekie said that an outdoor production with the Moot Hall only yards away put the focus squarely on the Suffolk town. Speaking after the dress rehearsal attended by Aldeburgh residents, he said: 'It was the most wonderful evening. It received a standing ovation. 'The town has been full of the sound of the opera for the last three weeks as rehearsals have been under way and the local people have been fantastically patient with us. Bleak: Benjamin Britten's opera Peter Grimes follows the story of a lonely fisherman on trial for the murder of his apprentice . Persecuted: But despite being cleared by the courts of the crime, Peter Grimes finds his villagers are more reluctant to accept his innocence . Last hope: Only one person believes in Grimes - the woman he wishes to marry called Ellen - who helps him track down his new apprentice . Isolated: But when Peter Grimes' second apprentice dies he finds he is completely alone - and not even Ellen is sure he is innocent . 'There has been a real sense of excitement in the town and I hope it has made Aldeburgh feel really good about the Britten legacy.' Mr Reekie said that if the international cast found daunting it to perform on the beach, the experience was useful as it brought them closer to the heart of Peter Grimes. The opera is based on a section of George Crabbe's poem The Borough and deals with the trial of fisherman Peter Grimes over the death of his apprentice during a storm at sea. Though he is acquitted in the eyes of the law, Grimes is still greeted with hostility by his fellow villagers who refuse to believe his innocence. Grimes' struggle against prejudice and persecution sees him slowly descend into insanity to a tragic end. First-rate production: Tim Albery constructed a large broadwalk to act as a stage on a shingle beach . Atmospheric: Upturned fishing boats were planted around the stage to make it appears as if a giant storm had just washed them ashore . Perfect setting: The sound of the waves washing over the shingle beach and the screams of gulls overhead added realism to the production . Wrapping up warm: Locals made sure they wore warm clothes, jackets and hats to watch the production on a chilly June evening . With the sound of surf thumping on to shingle and the screams of gulls mixing with the music, it was easy to slip into the mindset of Britten's brooding anti-hero. The cast is the same one that performed, to great acclaim, the concert version of the opera at nearby Snape Maltings last week. Although the performances were sung live, the Britten-Pears Orchestra was recorded at the Snape concerts and the music was broadcast on Aldeburgh Beach. Mr Reekie said that the project was audacious enough without wanting to have an orchestra battling the wild North Sea elements as well as the cast. Three concerts being staged are already sell-outs but the event is also being filmed to be shown in cinemas in the autumn.

Hundreds of mourners braved cold and rainy weather yesterday to honor an eight-year-old Pennsylvania girl - who had been serenaded by thousands of Christmas carolers just days before she died of cancer on Christmas morning. In contrast to the drab weather, many of the mourners wore bright pink, orange or green for Delaney Brown's viewing Sunday at the request of her parents, to honor what they called her 'fashionista style.' 'Today's about Laney and it's about . the impact she had on a community and the incredible love of her family . and her indomitable spirit, and her fight till the end,' family . spokesman Chris Winters said.

Delaney, whose nickname was Laney, died on Christmas morning from a rare form of leukemia. One of the West Reading second-grader's last wishes had been for a huge holiday singalong. Thousands appeared outside her family's home on Dec. 21 to sing Christmas carols. Shortly . afterward, the family's Facebook page showed a picture of Laney giving . two thumbs up with the text: 'I can hear you now!!! Love you!' On . Sunday, a line of people holding umbrellas to shield themselves from . the rain outside the Kuhn Funeral Home in West Reading, Pennsylvania, . stood with heads bowed or stared at posters of Delaney as they waited to . write a few kind words to the Browns.

'I can hear you now!!! Love you!': Delaney showed her appreciation for the throng of Christmas well-wishers in a Facebook post on the Saturday night before Christmas as she lay stuck in her bed . Mitzi . Munoz, 40, of Reading, who wore a hoodie emblazoned with hot pink, had . tears in her eyes as she talked about the impact of the girl's story on . her. 'Laney just touched my . heart so much. It's hard to explain,' she said. 'I don't know if I met . her in a store or saw her outside her house one day while she was . playing, but she inspired me.' Christi Kuprij-Brown, 45, of Reading, said Laney's story inspired her to get involved in raising cancer awareness. 'Now it's time for me to do something,' she said. 'This has really made me aware I need to do more in my community.' The family is still struggling to come to terms with the little girl's loss. 'This . house is still full of all the medical machines and her birthday . presents, her Christmas presents,' posted Laney's father, Jeremiah . Brown, just after she died last week. 'There . used to be a little girl normally already sitting on our couch watching . TV when I wake up early in the morning. My life will never be the same . since that little angel touched it.' Laney Brown is survived by her parents and two siblings.

Rare: Delaney has a serious and very rare form of childhood leukemia called acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with monosomy 7 .

Mehmet Gilgil, 25, pleaded guilty to selling food not of the 'substance or quality required' after an inch-long lump of metal was found baked into a pizza at Flames Kebabs in Romford, East London. The bolt is believed to have come loose inside the oven and fallen into the pizza as it cooked. Shoddy: Mehmet Gilgil pleaded guilty to selling food not of the 'substance or quality required' after an inch-long lump of metal was found baked into a pizza . Mr Gilgil was fined £1,000 and ordered to pay £750 in costs and a £100 victim surcharge for serving the pizza to an unsuspecting customer in December 2012. Romford council’s cabinet member for Public Protection, Councillor Lesley Kelly said: 'Selling shoddy products of any kind is not acceptable and is particularly important when preparing food.' Mr Kelly added: 'We will always prosecute and seek the highest possible fine to make sure that everyone maintains standards in their kitchens.' 'This was a cheap bolt that got someone an expensive fine and that should be a lesson to others.' Standards: Councillor Lesley Kelly 'This was a cheap bolt that got someone an expensive fine and that should be a lesson to others' There have been a number of incidents of foreign objects found in food in recent months. In November a plumber claimed he had been left unable to eat anything after discovering a dead mouse inside a bag of Tesco frozen scampi. Mohammed Ali, 37, said he could only stomach fruit juice after finding the dead rodent inside his packet of seafood. He had poured the contents into a deep fat fryer for an afternoon snack, but then a couple of minutes later noticed something black floating in the hot oil. Mr Ali, from West Lothian in Scotland, said: ‘I stuck my hand in the bag and put it in - I was in a hurry.'He says he spotted the dead mouse floating in the oil around two minutes later. Earlier this year Tony Hinds, 27, found a human tooth embedded in a pork and chive sausage from Tesco’s Finest range. Mr Hinds, from Queenborough in Kent, had planned to use them to make sausage rolls for his birthday party, but abandoned the plans when his fiancée removed the packaging and found the tooth stuck in the side of a sausage. Mr Ali found the dead mouse inside a £3 bag of Tesco scampi. The 37-year-old claimed the incident left him unable to consume anything other than fruit juice . Fried: The dead mouse was in hot oil along with the scampi for around two minutes before Mr Ali noticed it . And only last weekend, a Pret A Manger customer in Manhattan, New York was shocked to discover a dead frog in her salad. The Wall Street Journal employee had visited the branch on Sixth Avenue/47 Street to get what she assumed would be a regular Albacore Tuna Nicoise Salad. But in addition to the tomatoes, tuna, egg and olives, there was an extra ingredient: the small amphibian, almost camouflaged among the salad leaves. The manager of the branch has since apologised and given the customer a refund, plus a voucher for a free lunch. The heavy fine kebab shop owner Mr . Gilgil received for serving the bolt in his pizza is in stark contrast . to the compensation Tesco offered Mr Hinds. Tesco initially offered only an apology and a £15 voucher for what it insisted was a piece of bone. Finally, after Mr Hinds protested further, the supermarket acknowledged that the unwelcome discovery was a tooth and added another £10. A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We are sorry for any upset. However, after a thorough investigation, we are confident the tooth was not inside the product when it arrived at the store.’ They added: ‘All products undergo robust testing during the manufacturing process, including metal detection. The object in question is part metal and, during supplier tests, it was easily picked up by the metal detector.’","Mehmet Gilgil admitted selling food not of the 'substance or quality required'

Discovery: Painkillers found in Tesco's chocolate and nut cones, pictured, could have been put there on purpose, police believe . Supermarket ice creams found to contain painkillers may have been deliberately spiked, police say. Tesco was forced to recall boxes of its own-brand chocolate and nut cones last month after two were found to have been contaminated. Now detectives believe the incident was sabotage. Tablets were found in two separate cones in stores in different parts of the country and police are investigating the R&R Ice Cream factory near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, that supplies Tesco. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn from the North Yorkshire Police' major crime unit said: 'What we are trying to identify is how that product became . contaminated. 'It . is a challenging investigation, because what we have got to try and . identify was how and where and who was responsible for that . contamination, and was it deliberate contamination. 'With . the process chain of all the ingredients that go into making an item . like that, we don’t know for sure where that contamination took place.' Mr Malyn added that the . possibility of malicious contamination was 'one of the lines of inquiry' and his 'gut instinct' is that it was a 'deliberate contamination'. He . added: 'If it was felt to be accidental from the outset, the resources . we have put into it probably wouldn’t be to the scale we have done. 'We have got to look at it as ""we think it’s suspicious unless we prove otherwise"".' Tesco recalled its own-brand cones in November after two separate packets delivered . to two different stores were found to contain the drugs. One tablet was found in a single cone in each packet. At the time the Food Standards Agency warned consumers not to eat the product and to return it to Tesco for a full refund. A Tesco spokeswoman said: 'As a precautionary measure, we issued a product recall on Tesco Chocolate and Nut Ice Cream Cones in November, after two individual cones were found to contain tablets. Investigation: The supermarket chain withdrew the product November after two separate batchs were found to be contaminated (library image) 'We are currently investigating this incident with our supplier and we are helping the police with their enquiries.'

'It is really a case of it being pending while they carry out their own investigation.' Mr .

'From . our point of view, if there is evidence of anything where there is . potential for a consumer to be injured in any way we need to find out . how it happened. 'If it . is something like a tablet, which cannot have been accidentally put . into the product, it needs to be investigated to try and find the . culprit.'

While most of us were celebrating as the clock struck midnight, some were enduring a very different New Year's Eve experience - among them the parents of the babies born as Big Ben's bongs chimed out. First off the mark was Lethea Rankine, from Edgbaston in Birmingham, who gave birth to her 7lb 7oz daughter Gracie just seconds after midnight. She was followed into the world by Martin Oglivie, from West Lothian, and Edward Sutheran and Lola-Jai Fenton, both from Coventry, who put in an appearance in the early hours of New Year's Day. Speedy arrival: Little Gracie Welcome, from Birmingham, was born as Big Ben chimed midnight . Gracie, weighing in at 7lbs 7oz, is the latest addition to a family who share their birthdays with big occasions. Gracie’s great-grandmother Adina Seymour and grandmother Georganne Rankine were both born on Christmas Day. And Gracie’s grandad, Leighton Rankine, was born on December 31. Cradling Gracie, who was born by caesarian section, in her arms, her proud mother Lethea said: 'She’s so beautiful. It was exciting knowing she was born just as the new year arrived.' The 22-year-old added: 'My waters broke at about 9.30am on the morning of New Year’s Eve. Then my contractions started about 7.30 in the evening. She came at 12 on the dot! Well, ten seconds past 12.' Proud: Parents Lethea Rankine, 22, and Romeo Welcome, 27, say they are delighted by the new arrival . Second: Martin Ogilvie was born at 12.01am at St Johns Hospital in Livingston, Scotland to Colleen . But Lethea, who moved to the UK from the Cayman Islands two years ago, said the birth brought mixed emotions. 'It was terrifying, painful and I just wanted to get it over with,' she added. '[Gracie's father Romeo Welcome] says she looks like him! 'We’ve been on the phone to my family and everyone was so excited. There must be something in the genes about birthdays.' In all, 11 babies were born at the Birmingham hospital on New Year’s Day. Hospital spokeswoman Nichola Robinson said: 'It’s quite a high number in such a short space of time.'

Happy hearts: A synthetic pregnancy hormone has been found to slash death rates for people with acute heart failure . A pregnancy hormone could provide the first breakthrough in 20 years for treating acute heart failure. Doctors . found that Serelaxin, a synthetic version of the hormone relaxin, can . slash the death rate for people with the condition. Heart . failure, which affects around 900,000 people in the UK, means the heart . can no longer pump enough blood around the body. The body tries to . compensate by increasing the heart rate and narrowing blood vessels to . push up blood pressure. But in the long term these put the heart under greater strain. As . the heart becomes less efficient, blood can pool in vessels around the . lungs; the pressure builds up and fluid leaks from the blood vessels . into the tiny air sacs, causing breathlessness, tiredness and swelling. Current . medications such as beta blockers and ACE inhibitors reduce stress on . the heart by, for example, lowering blood pressure. This helps alleviate . symptoms but does not help the underlying condition, which can progress . to acute heart failure. Here . the lungs are so filled with fluid the patient finds it difficult to . breathe at all, and feels as though they are drowning. It is a . life-threatening emergency which requires immediate hospital treatment — . around 30 per cent of patients hospitalised after an episode of acute . heart failure die within a year, making it more deadly than a heart . attack. Just 'relaxin': Seralaxin is a man-made version of relaxin, which rises dramatically during pregnancy in order to reduce strain on the mother¿s heart . The new treatment is . based on relaxin — levels of this rise dramatically during pregnancy in . order to reduce strain on the mother’s heart. The amount of blood . circulating in a woman’s body increases by between 20-50 per cent in . order to transport oxygen to the foetus via the placenta. Scientists have discovered people with psoriasis are at raised risk of heart failure. A team at the University of Copenhagen studied adults with and without psoriasis over 12 years and found those with the condition had almost double the incidence of heart failure. The risk went up as the severity of psoriasis increased. Psoriasis causes scaly, inflamed patches and is caused by an overproduction of skin cells. ‘Chronic inflammation is a characteristic of both psoriasis and heart failure and may play a significant role in their development,’ said lead author Dr Usman Khalid, a cardiologist from Gentofte Hospital, Hellerup, Denmark. ‘Psoriasis should be considered an inflammatory disease that affects the whole body, rather than an isolated skin lesion. ‘Patients with psoriasis need education about the association between their skin condition and cardiovascular disease so that they can be sure to adopt heart-healthy behaviours.’ However, . this means her heart needs to work 30 per cent harder. Relaxin helps by . opening up the blood vessels and reducing blood pressure, taking excess . strain off the heart; relaxin also boosts kidney function, removing . waste products from the blood. A . six-month international study found that Serelaxin reduced heart . failure death rates by a third (37 per cent) compared to conventional . treatments such as ACE inhibitors. Serelaxin appears to help the heart . itself, unlike existing treatments which simply improve symptoms, says . Martin Cowie, professor of cardiology at Imperial College London. He was . not involved in the research but believes the new drug could mark ‘a . seismic shift’ in the treatment of acute heart failure. ‘The . current medications dampen the body’s own responses to the heart not . pumping properly (such as increased blood pressure) whereas Serelaxin . works in synch with the body, he says. ‘We . are not entirely clear how it works but it helps take the load off the . heart. It also helps prevent further damage to the heart and kidneys, . and this translates into longer-term benefit.’ The . drug, which was developed by Novartis, is given in a drip for the first . 48 hours after a patient is admitted with heart failure — when the risk . of other organs failing is greatest, because of the poor blood supply. More studies are being conducted on the drug, which could be approved as early as next year. Fighting cancer: Black raspberry . Black raspberries might help prevent bowel cancer, suggest U.S. researchers. The North American berries are a more intensely flavoured variety and are rich in antioxidants (disease-fighting compounds). Previous studies have suggested that eating black raspberries regularly could reduce the risks of bowel cancer. In . a new study, the Medical College of Wisconsin tested the berries on . mice with ulcerative colitis (an inflammatory condition that’s a . possible precursor to bowel cancer). One . group of mice was fed black rasp- berries, another were put on a normal . diet, and ulceration in the colon was measured (an indicator of the . risk of cancer). The results found the berries prevented ulceration by blocking the signals that instruct healthy cells to become malignant. A decay detector has been designed to identify dental problems long before fillings are needed. The . hand-held wand or probe-like device homes in on subtle changes in the . mineral content of tooth enamel — these tiny changes, a sign that the . tooth is being damaged by decay, can be detected by passing a mild . electric current through the teeth. Detection . of decay at a very early stage is usually difficult. One problem is the . widespread use of fluoride, which helps keep the enamel intact and . apparently healthy, masking decay inside it. In a trial starting this month at the Central University of Venezuela, the device will be used on 200 children. A device that puffs medication into the nose has been developed to tackle low blood sugar levels — hypoglycaemia — in diabetes. This . can occur if a patient takes too much insulin, misses a meal or after . exercise, and causes drowsiness or loss of consciousness. Prolonged, . severe hypoglycaemia can led to  brain damage and heart problems. Sugary . food or drink can reverse it; in severe cases, the drug glucagon is . injected to raise blood sugar. But this is available only as a powder . that must be diluted, which is difficult during an attack. The . new device, being tested on 70 patients at Yale University and other . U.S. centres, speeds up the delivery, administering a powdered form of . glucagon into the nostrils without the need to inhale. The trial is due . to end next May.","Serelaxin can cut the death rate for people with acute heart failure .

The suicide bombings in Russia serve as a chilling reminder of what the Winter Olympics represent to terrorists: A high-profile target with more than 2,500 athletes, some of them world-famous, waving the flags of nearly 90 nations. So, while many Olympic leaders offered reassurance on the day after two bombings 400 miles from Sochi killed at least 31 people, some of those getting ready to compete in the Games spoke of a different reality. They know their security is never sure thing. 'I am concerned,' said U.S. speedskater Jilleanne Rookard. 'I'm scared their security may be involved. I don't know if I necessarily trust their security forces. But they don't want a national embarrassment, either. I use that thought to relieve some of my worry. I'm sure they want to save their image and their pride.' Scroll down for video . Terrorist attack: The wreckage of a trolleybus following a suicide attack that destroyed the packed trolleybus killing 14 people in the southern Russian city of Volgograd . Indeed, the Russians vow the athletes will be safe, even though they will be competing in a city 300 miles away from the roots of an Islamist insurgency that has triggered security concerns for the Games, which start February 7, fewer than six weeks away. The country has spent a record $51 billion preparing for its first Winter Games and has promised to make the Games 'the safest in Olympic history.' Olympic chief Alexander Zhukov said the bombings didn't spark a need for additional security measures because 'everything necessary already has been done.' Swedish hockey player Johan Franzen of the Red Wings sees things a little differently. 'I'm sure after this, the security will be higher than they intended from the start,' he said. U.S. two-time gold medalist Scott Wescott told USA Today that if he qualifies for snowboard cross he doesn't think he'll attend the opening ceremony. 'It definitely concerns me,' Wescott said Monday. 'I don't want to be pessimistic about it. … I think you're watching events start to happen. It's a country that's had massive amounts of internal strife that has manifested itself into actual combat. We're not far away from where a lot of that has gone on in their country. It's definitely a concern.' Secure: Russian police officer stands on a street in Sochi December 30, 2013. The IOC has no doubt Russian authorities will be able to provide security at the Winter Olympics, a spokeswoman said on Monday after two bomb blasts killed more than 30 in the city of Volgograd . Unconcerned: Hockey player Johan Franzen says he thinks security will be extremely high at Sochi . The threat of terrorism at the Olympics has been in the forefront since 1972, when members of a Palestinian terrorist group invaded the Olympic village and killed 11 Israeli athletes. Security rose to a new level at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, which came only five months after the September 11 attacks. Improvements in technology, along with ever-present threats of terrorism, have turned security into a top priority for any country hoping to host the Olympics. Among the security measures Russia has put in place for this year's games is a requirement that all ticket-holders obtain and wear 'spectator passes' while attending events. To get a spectator pass, fans have to provide passport and contact information to authorities. Intense: U.S. figure skater Ross Miner says that in his experience, the security at the 2011 Moscow World Cup was the most intense . On Monday, IOC president Thomas Bach wrote a condolence letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin in which he expressed 'our confidence in the Russian authorities to deliver safe and secure games in Sochi.' Meanwhile, a number of Olympic leaders and federations signaled their confidence in the host country. 'When we come to Sochi, it will be impossible for the terrorists to do anything,' Norwegian IOC member Gerhard Heiberg said. 'The village will be sealed off from the outside world. Security has been our priority No. 1 ever since Sochi got the games.' The U.S. Olympic Committee works closely with the State Department on its security arrangements. A White House spokeswoman said the United States would welcome 'closer cooperation' with Russia on security preparations for the Games. Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has said the country may impose a travel ban to the country. 'These . terror attacks are shocking and a reminder of the ongoing battle to . confront extremism in all its forms worldwide,' Bishop told the . Australian. 'We don't . want to lightly prevent our athletes participating in any event for . which they have trained for years, but their safety and the safety of . their families and other spectators is of the utmost concern.' Australian athletes seem undeterred by the potential danger. Olympic aerial skiing champion Lydia Lassila said she was 'not concerned' about her safety in Sochi. 'We all put a lot of faith in security at any Olympics and I'm confident Russia is using all measures to ensure security is sound,' Lassila said. Aerial skier David Morris told the Australian that he was 'more scared of falling off the scaffolding in Beijing last week (a World Cup event was held in Beijing's Bird Nest stadium) than I am of an incident at the Games.' Travel ban: Despite a possible travel ban, Australian aerial skier Lydia Lassila says she has faith in Russia's security measures . U.S. figure skater Ross Miner, who won silver in Vancouver, is well aware of the vulnerability of major sporting events. The theme of the New England native's long program is 'Boston Strong,' about the city's resilience after the marathon bombings last spring. Miner recalled the 2011 world championships in Moscow as 'by far the most intense security I've ever had at a competition,' with skaters going through metal detectors to enter the venue. U.S. speedskaters, however, have different memories of Moscow. They arrived for a 2011 World Cup event the same day a suicide bomber killed 35 people in an attack on the city's Domodedovo Airport. 'It's terrible we have to live in fear, but that's just kind of how it is,' two-time gold and silver medalist Shani Davis said. Hosts: Russia has spent $51 million on its Winter Olympics. Here, an aerial view from a helicopter shows the Olympic Park under construction in the Adler district of the Black Sea resort city of Sochi . Since the widespread use of metal detectors was introduced to the Olympics in 2002, every subsequent Olympics has brought its own set of challenges and responses. At the Beijing Olympics in 2008, Chinese authorities introduced identity checks for opening and closing ceremonies. In London last year, there were no identity checks, but combat jets patrolled the city, and surface-to-air missiles were set up on rooftops. Russia's security effort is greater than those of either of those countries, said Matthew Clements, an analyst at Jane's, in a recent interview with The Associated Press. Three-time Olympic ski jumping champion Thomas Morgenstern of Austria said he remembers seeing sharp shooters roaming the woods in Sochi during a World Cup event last year. 'Of course you're having thoughts about it. But when we are at the Olympic Games, that will be one of the safest places for sure,' Morgenstern said. 'I think they are in control.'","Two bombs exploded in Volgograd killing more than 30 people, just 300 miles from Sochi .

Hunter-gatherers search for food in the same way as animals including sharks and honeybees, according to anthropologists. The Hadza tribe – one of the last big game hunters in Africa - hunt for food in a way that is described by a mathematical pattern called a Lévy walk. The pattern is found in the movements of lots of animals but it is the first time that it has been found to match the way that humans forage. The Hadza tribe ¿ one of the last big game hunters in Africa - hunt for food in a way that is described by a mathematical pattern called a Lévy walk. Here, a Hadza hunter wearing a baboon skin returns to camp with a haunch of impala over his shoulder . The Lévy walk pattern appears to be ubiquitous in animals, similar to the golden ratio, phi, which is a mathematical ratio that has been found to describe proportions in plants and animals throughout nature. Now a study led by University of Arizona anthropologist David Raichlen has found it can be applied to the Hadza tribe in Tanzania. ‘Scientists have been interested in characterising how animals search for a long time, so we decided to look at whether human hunter-gatherers use similar patterns,' said Professor Raichlen. The Hadza tribe is one of the last groups on Earth to still forage on foot with traditional methods and Professor Raichen said: ‘If you want to understand human hunter-gatherer movement, you have to work with a group like the Hadza’. For the experiment, members of the tribe wore wristwatches with GPS units that tracked their movement while on hunting trips. The Lévy walk pattern appears to be ubiquitous in animals, including sharks and is similar to the golden ratio, phi, as it is a mathematical ratio that has been found to describe proportions in plants and animals throughout nature . The Lévy walk involves a series of short movements in one area and then a longer trek to another area. The definition stems from mathematics related to chaos theory and is useful in simulations for random or pseudo-random natural phenomena. Examples include earthquake data analysis, financial mathematics and well applications in astronomy, biology, and physics. When sharks and other ocean predators can’t find food, the opt for a mixture of long trajectories and short, random movements - a  Lévy walk. Researchers have previously analysed over 12 million movements recorded over 5,700 days in 55 radio-tagged animals from 14 ocean predator species in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, including silky sharks, yellow fin tuna, blue marlin and swordfish. The data showed that Lévy flights interspersed with Brownian motion (the random motion seen in swirling gas molecules) can describe the animals' hunting patterns. Birds and other animals also seem to follow Lévy flights when searching for food. The GPS data showed that while the Hadza use other movement patterns, the dominant theme of their foraging movements is a Lévy walk – the same pattern used by many other animals when hunting or foraging. The Lévy walk involves a series of short movements in one area and then a longer trek to another area. Brian Wood, an anthropologist at Yale University who has worked with the Hadza people since 2004 and co-author of the study, said: ‘Detecting this pattern among the Hadza, as has been found in several other species, tells us that such patterns are likely the result of general foraging strategies that many species adopt, across a wide variety of contexts.’ Describing human movement patterns could help anthropologists understand how humans transported raw materials in the past. Professor Raichlen said: ‘We can characterise these movement patterns across different human environments and that means we can use this movement pattern to understand past mobility.’ Adam Gordon, another co-author of the study and a physical anthropologist at the University of Albany, State University of New York, explained that the mathematical pattern seems to occur across species and environments from the desert to cities. ‘It shows up all across the world in different species and links the way that we move around in the natural world. This suggests that it’s a fundamental pattern likely present in our evolutionary history’ he said. The Hadza tribe is one of the last groups on Earth to still forage on foot with traditional methods and Professor Raichen said: 'If you want to understand human hunter-gatherer movement, you have to work with a group like the Hadza'. Here, a youth sits on a Greater kudu skin and plays a musical instrument . The Lévy walk is not limited to searching for food. Studies have shown that humans sometimes follow a Lévy walk while ambling around an amusement park and it can be used for planning cities. Professor Raichlen said that most people observe the Lévy walk pattern on a daily basis. ‘What do you do on a normal day? Go to work and come back, walk short distances around your house? Then every once in a while you take these long steps, on foot, bike, in a car or on a plane. We tend to take short steps in one area and then take longer strides to get to another area,’ he said. The researchers hope to conduct further research to understand the reasons for using a Lévy walk and whether the pattern is determined by the distribution of resources in the environment. Herman Pontzer, a member of the research team and an anthropologist at Hunter College in New York, said: ‘We’re very interested in studying why the Hadza use this pattern, what’s driving their hunting strategies and when they use this pattern versus another pattern.’ Professor Wood said: ‘We'd really like to know how and why specific environmental conditions or individual traits influence movement patterns.' The study was published in in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Researchers led by the University of Arizona used a pattern called a Lévy walk to describe the way humans forage for food for the first time .

An ancient terracotta baby bottle shaped like a pig has been uncovered by Italian archaeologists. The vessel, which can also be used as a baby’s rattle, is 2,400 years old and is thought to have belonged to a member of the Messapian tribe who lived in the south of Italy at the time. The bottle, or ‘guttus’ has human-like eyes and terracotta balls in its stomach so it could become a rattle after a baby had finished drinking its meal from the quirky vessel. A 2,400-year-old pig-shaped terracotta baby bottle, which can also be used as a rattle, has been uncovered by Italian archaeologists . It was found in a Messapian tomb in Manduria, near Taranto in Puglia, Italy – a region that was inhabited by the Messapian people in around 1,000 BC – along with a number of other objects. The stone tomb, which measures eight by four square feet and is decorated with bands of blue, red and ochre, contained the remains of two people. The Messapians typically buried family members together and there were also remains of a later burial in the same tomb. ‘We found some skeletal remains piled in an angle. Other remains, related to a later burial, occupied the entire tomb,’ Arcangelo Alessio of the Archaeological Superintendency of Puglia told Discovery News. The team of archaeologists found 30 objects in the tomb, including two terracotta figurines of females, three baby bottles, including the unusual pig-shaped one, as well as jars, vases, laps and plates, which have now been cleaned and restored. A black basin and iron knife suggest a . male burial, while a traditional vase called a trozzella, suggests a . female was also laid to rest in the tomb as the vase is often found in . tombs of women at the time. The bottle, or 'guttus' has human-like eyes and terracotta balls in its stomach so it could become a rattle after a baby had finished its meal, dispensed from the quirky vessel . However, the presence of the baby bottles and the female figures suggests a newborn girl might have been buried there too, as the figures were often placed in the graves of young girls. Archaeologist Gianfranco Dimitri told Discovery News: ‘We might speculate that the female individual was pregnant at the time of death.’ He thinks it will be difficult to ascertain whether the bottle did belong to a baby, as it is probable that any baby’s bones have completely decomposed. Dr Alessio said ‘Analysis of the funerary objects and their context suggest that the two burials followed one another in the Hellenistic period, between the end of the fourth and the third-second centuries BC.’ The bottle was found in a Messapian tomb in Manduria, near Taranto in Puglia, Italy - a region that was inhabited by the Messapian people in around 1,000BC - along with a number of other objects .

By the time that Davis reached Edwin, he was buried up to his neck in snow as he struggled to keep his head up for air. It took four hours of digging to free the survivor.

Hundreds of mourners braved bitterly cold weather to pay their last respects to Canada's 'godfather', drug trafficking mastermind Vito Rizzuto. The 67-year-old was laid to rest in a gold casket following an hour-long mass at the Notre-Dame-de-la-Défense Church in Montreal yesterday. Rizzuto's coffin was followed from the church by his two surviving adult children, Leonardo and Bettina, the Montreal Gazette reported.

Mobster Vito Rizzuto, left, died of natural causes at a Montreal hospital on December 23. Right, his mother Libertina Manno, left, arrives for his funeral in the Canadian city . Members of the Rizzuto family leave the Montreal church after the Mafia boss's funeral. His son Leonardo was among the mourners . Nine limousines waited outside the Notre-Dame-de-la-Défense Church in the heart of Montreal's Little Italy, for Vito Rizzuto's family . Nine limousines waited in the street outside to transport the family as dozens of photographers, TV crews, onlookers gathered alongside police officers who were busy gaining intelligence from those who came to pay their respects to the Mafia boss. Rizzuto, who ruled for decades at the helm of Montreal's Mafia, died of natural causes in a Montreal hospital on December 23. His funeral was held in the same church where masses were held for his son Nick in 2009 and his father Nicolo in 2010. Both were gunned down while Vito Rizzuto was held in prison in the US for his part in the murders of three Mafia bosses in New York in 1981. Rizzuto's health problems first came to light in 2007 when he was up in front of an American judge, who sentenced him to the equivalent of 10 years behind bars. The Mob boss, who oversaw a heroin and cocaine network that spanned the length and breadth of the country, told the judge two months earlier a doctor had recommended he have a CT scan after noticing a spot on his lung. The Rizzuto family were joined by friends as hundreds gathered to pay their respects. The funeral was held at the same church where masses were held for Rizzuto's son Nick in 2009 and father Nicolo in 2010. Both were gunned down while Rizzuto was in prison in the US .

Igino Incantalupo, the priest who oversaw the ceremony, told the Toronto Star: 'It was a very simple funeral. 'People displayed a very, very surprising level of calm and seriousness.' Those who tried to enter the church to pay their respects were screened, and asked if they were known by the family. But for those waiting outside, the freezing cold did not deter their sense of intrigue. Marjolaine Martin, 65, grew up nearby and told the Star she was attracted by the air of mystery surrounding the family, having watched from the street at the funerals of Rizzuto's father and son as well. 'When I think that when I grew up here and played in the neighbourhood, and they were probably around here,' she said.

'We don’t know their secrets, that’s for sure, but their names are mentioned all the time in the newspapers and on the news.'

His sudden death has opened a vacuum at . the top of Montreal's Mafia network, with police waiting to see who will . take the first steps to fill the void. 'The successor will very likely come from within the family,' one source told The Gazette. 'Someone acting as a consigliere (a counsellor), likely Rocco Sollecito will look at everything and advise the family on who should take over. But for the Rizzutos (based on the past) it will be a relative, someone from the family.' Police in Montreal had for years thought Rizzuto's son Nick was the one being groomed to take over from this father while Leonardo practised law. But Nick's death in 2009 changed that, leaving the succession open.","Hundreds of mourners gather to pay their respects to the head of Montreal's Mafia .

A North Carolina town continued its New Year's Even tradition Tuesday night by lowering a live possum from the roof of a convenience store at midnight. The 20th annual Brasstown possum Drop drew thousands to Clay's Corner convenience store both for the main event and the festivities that lead up to it including music performances and a 'womanless beauty pageant.' The lowering of the possum came with big fanfare this year as it does every year, but in the days leading up to the event no one was certain if the 2013 drop would go on as planned. Scroll Down for Video . Critter: This possum was caught from the wild and used as the 2013 Possum Drop possum in the annual Brasstown, North Carolina event . 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! The eagerly awaited culmination of the event is the lowering of the possum in a box (pictured) from the roof the the town's only gas station . That's because animal rights group PETA the state Wildlife Resources Commission, who issued a permit for the event, in an attempt to halt the tradition. A PETA lawyer says the lights, noise and crowd of people can wreck the wild-caught possum's nerves and health. But a Raleigh judge ruled Monday that the unincorporated mountain town's holiday tradition could go on. Revelers took in a bluegrass performance, watched as antique rifles were fired and rejoiced as men dressed as scantily clad women danced on the main stage. 'Rednecks have a lot of fun, and it don't take a lot of money or things to do. We just do plain old silly, stupid stuff, just Southern things that we do,' said event founder Clay Logan (pictured) 'They're not men in drag, I'll tell you that right now': One of the events held before the Possum Drop each year is a 'womanless beauty pageant' Just don't get the wrong idea. 'They're not men in drag, I'll tell you that right now,' said event founder Clay Logan. One of the men sported an exposed midriff that bore the words 'Eat mor possum.' According to the New York Times, Logan started the  event 20 years ago when someon asked him, 'If New York City can drop a ball, why can't we drop a possum?' Logan couldn't think of a reason why not and started the tradition, which is still held at the only gas station in town, which Logan owns. Something for everyone: Other events including the firing of some old rifles and a bluegrass performance . 'It's something we've been doing for 20 years,' said Logan. Here, a sign for the town of 250 people and self-described Possum Capital of the World . 'They're kinda dropping a possum. It's different from a giant ball in New York,' one observant young girl told WRCB. While some disparage the event as inhumane, Logan maintains that the alcohol free, family friendly Possum Drop is all in good fun. 'Rednecks have a lot of fun, and it don't take a lot of money or things to do. We just do plain old silly, stupid stuff, just Southern things that we do,' he said. While this year the possum was lowered in a black box Logan called 'a state specified cage,' previous years have seen it in a clear plexiglass container so it could be easily viewed. It's one of a number of changes Logan has witnessed since founding the event. 'You know, we're not rednecks anymore, we're Appalachian Americans so we can do other things now than just being silly,' he said.

Fashion accessories: Chihuahuas became trendy after they were seen in the purses of Hollywood celebrities like Paris Hilton . ‘People need to understand that they are living creatures and they need to be loved and taken care of.’ Ms Zambito expects the number of abandoned Chihuahuas to rise in the new year as dogs given as Christmas presents may be given away. She said: ‘Chihuahuas are being euthanised at a high rate because they are misunderstood - their numbers are rising in shelters. Ms Zambito explained that huge numbers of chihuahuas are being abandoned as they become less fashionable . ‘I can't bear the thought of these dogs being killed in such high numbers so I will do what I can to give them a home. ‘A dog shouldn't be given as a gift. A dog is for life, not just for Christmas.’ Ms Zambito said many people abandon Chihuahuas because they do not understand their personalities and don't train them the right way. She said: ‘Chihuahuas are a very loyal dog. If you don't nurture them enough, or overly nurture them, they get overly possessive and nippy. ‘I personally love the breed because they all have their own quirky personalities and they're very protective. ‘Many people think that small dogs like Chihuahuas don't need to be trained like big dogs, they think they just sit there and look cute. Pooch paradise: There are currently 60 dogs living at Precious Pups Rescue . ‘They do need to be trained and be given boundaries just like big dogs.’ According to Ms Zambito, there is an overabundance of Chihuahuas in some US states because dogs stay outside, breed and wander around without owners. Many of the dogs that are taken to Precious Pups Rescue are from South Carolina, Texas, Georgia and Florida. Ms Zambito said: ‘I'd say about ninety percent of the dogs here would have been dead if we hadn't taken them in. ‘Dogs are euthanised differently depending on the shelter. Sometimes dogs are killed by what's called a heart stick, they put a needle in the heart and the heart stops. ‘Other shelters will sedate the dogs - worst case scenario they will put them in a box and gas them to death. ‘There is nothing humane at all about euthanising a dog merely because of space.’ There are currently 60 dogs living at Precious Pups Rescue. Ms Zambito said: ‘There's so many of them and they all have such short hair, so five or six of them cuddle up in one bed together - it's the cutest thing.’ While Ms Zambito is saving as many dogs as she can, she wishes she can take in more dogs. ‘When I can't save a dog, it's heartbreaking because they haunt you and they stay with you forever because you know you're their link to a new life and to life period.’","Chihuahuas were made fashionable by celebrities such as Paris Hilton .

Record: The pound has hit its highest level against the US dollar for nearly two and a half years - 1.65 dollars . This means UK holidaymakers now have up to 28 per cent more spending money for trips to America's biggest shopping hotspots, such as Bloomingdale's, Macy's and Barneys New York, according to a Post Office Travel Money survey. It comes amid rising hopes for Britain's economic recovery. The nation's economy has been picking up pace in recent months - with figures continuing to suggest that the Bank of England will raise interest rates earlier than expected. Astonishingly, the UK is predicted to . become Europe's largest economy in just two decades, overtaking France . and Germany, according to a report from the Centre for Economics . and Business Research (CEBR). Bargain hunting: A stronger pound means British shoppers could fare better heading to New York (pictured) Money to spend: UK holidaymakers now have up to 28 per cent more spending money for trips to America's biggest shopping hotspots, such as Bloomingdale's (right) and Macy's (left) and Barneys New York . Last year, Britain's growth was 0.3 per cent higher than a previous estimate of 0.1 per cent, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Meanwhile, the figure for the first quarter of this year was revised up from 0.4 per cent to 0.5 per cent and for the second quarter, from 0.7 per cent to 0.8 per cent. The stronger pound is good news for holidaymakers - with cheap trips now available in a range of countries as the sterling strengthens against the local currency. The best-value destination for a seven-day New Year break is Sharm . el-Sheikh in Egypt (£399), with Orlando in Florida (£719) and Dubai (£983) also offering good deals. Good value: The pound's high level is also good news for sun-seekers. A seven-day New Year break to Sharm el-Sheikh (pictured) in Egypt is now available for £399 as the sterling strengthens against the local currency . Meanwhile, sun-seekers can travel to Playa del Carmen in Mexico for one week for just £899, according to a Post Office Travel Money and Travelbag survey. Paul . Havenhand, Post Office head of travel, said: 'Egypt's Red Sea resorts . have always been a good value option, but it's not just Sharm el-Sheikh . where sun-seekers will find their pounds stretch further. 'Sterling . currently buys more holiday cash in all 10 of our January hotspots, with . the biggest benefits to be found in Cape Town and Bali. 'Holidaymakers . can make sure they get the best value by doing their holiday homework . before booking to see how the overall costs stack up.' As well as boosting tourists' spending power, a stronger pound has also helped bring down UK inflation by making it cheaper for Britain to import goods and services. However, sterling's rise to 1.65 dollars - a level not seen since August 2011 - could prove difficult for manufacturers and exporters. This is because a stronger pound makes products more expensive for overseas buyers; therefore, potentially dampening demand. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee recently warned that a significant increase in the pound's strength could pose risks to the recovery, while also hampering the Government's aims to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing and exports.","Pound has hit its highest level in two and a half years - 1.65 US dollars .

Health coach, Laura Thomas, 27, a self-confessed former sugar addict, discovered there's a huge difference in the amount of sugar in the same products from leading supermarkets. There's as much as 30g difference in the amount of sugar in a portion of Christmas pudding depending on whose offering you consume. Sainsbury's christmas pudding comes in at the highest in sugar with a huge 56g per portion - that's more sugar than the NHS recommend women consume in a day. In comparison, Waitrose Remy Martin Chanmpagne pud has 32g per portion. 'For what is essentially the same food, that's a big difference,' Laura told the MailOnline. She added: 'I was very shocked when I first realised just how much sugar was actually in a single Christmas pudding portion, especially when you consider it's nearly all of a women's 50g daily limit in one go (and it's not unknown for people to have two portions). 'You can suddenly see how the pudding, mince pies, chocolate and alcohol could really add up to mean people are easily eating and drinking three times their daily sugar limit without even thinking twice. I think it's useful for people to just be aware of this so they are careful with portion sizes.' Aldi and the Co-op's Christmas puds also came in high on the sweetness scale as they all had more than 50g of sugar per portion. More sugary by half : Sainsbury's Taste the Difference Christmas pudding has 56g of sugar per portion, left, almost double that of the Waitrose Remy Martin pud . A Sainsbury's spokesman said: 'Our Taste . the Difference Hidden Cherry Centre Christmas Pudding is a once a year . indulgent treat. It's very high fruit content, including the delicious . hidden cherry centre, means that this pudding is naturally higher in . sugar than a pudding with less fruit.' The NHS recommend men have 70g of sugar a day and women 50g. Eating too much sugar contributes to health problems including tooth decay, obesity and developing type-2 diabetes. Laura, who writes the blog happysugarhabits.com, said people don't need to deny themselves festive treats but they can cut down their sugar intake with some savvy choices and awareness of nutritional content. She said: 'I'm often unpopular at this time of year as I'm telling people not to eat mince pies and drink mulled wine. But with a few simple food swaps you can cut down on how much sugar you have so it won't ruin your Christmas.' Laura recommends: 'Keep sugar somewhat sensible by looking for puddings that are at least under 45g of sugar per portion and where sugar isn't the first ingredient. This at least means that the sugars are from the more natural fruit source rather than refined sugarcane.' When it comes to mince pies, there's also a vast difference between sugar contents between the various supermarket products. Sainsbury's Taste The Difference mince pies, left, are also high in sugar with 24.8g per pie compared to Heston from Waitrose mince pies which have 19.1g . Sainsbury's are the highest with their Taste the Difference Brandy Rich Mince Pies containing 24.8g per pie. Tesco Finest has 22g but Asda is far lower with 18g in their Chosen by You product. Laura said: 'A single mince pie can have up to 30g of sugar (six teaspoons) so look for ones that come in under 20g. Even better opt for a mini mince pie which tend to average around 7g of sugar per portion.' For an even healthier mince pie, Laura recommends ditching the supermarket varieties for baking your own. She said: 'By making your own mince pies you can cut the sugar and the fat by using just dried fruit alone to sweeten the pie and swapping sweet shortcrust pastry with filo or puff pastry.' She also recommends making your own mulled wine to cut down on sugar as pre-made versions will have more in order to preserve them for longer. Festive foodie: Laura Thomas says you can cut down on sugar and still have a sweet Christmas with some savvy choices . Aside from mince pie and Christmas pud choices, Laura recommends keeping your sugar intake down by snacking on other festive treats such as nuts, satsumas and cheese. If you do have chocolate she advises: 'Opt for dark chocolates over milk or white ones. Generally the higher per cent cocoa solids, the less sugar.' She added: 'Don't eat food mindlessly over the Christmas period for the sake of it. You don't need to eat every sugary food that's offered to you. Mark out which days you'll treat yourself, look forward to them, and have some control with the rest.' But there is hope for anyone who simply can't resist the sweet treats over Christmas and are happy to keep indulging till the New Year. Laura will be running a six week 'Mentor Me Off Sugar' programme from 6th Jan which she said will help people combat their sugar cravings for good. So next Christmas, you won't be at the mercy of your sweet tooth. For more information, visit happysugarhabits.com .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:35 EST, 1 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 05:09 EST, 1 January 2014 . Well-wishers have far surpassed the fundraising goals of the family of a 12-year-old girl from Texas whose brain tumor surgery that caused her to become obese and leaving her with two options - surgery or death. With the U.S. military, her family's insurance provider, unwilling to pay for the girl's $50,000 operation because 'she's too young,' her family turned to crowd funding and found success - to the tune of $76,000. Alexis Shapiro is 4 foot 7 and weighs almost 200 pounds. Alexis feels like she is constantly starving due to the fact that her surgery to remove a benign tumor caused damage to her hypothalamus, instigating the development of hypothalamic obesity. Alexis Shapiro is obese but feels like she's starving and needs gastric bypass surgery in order to survive . The young girl's family was afraid the appeal process would take longer than she had. A GoFundMe page asking for help was set up, and it was more successful than they ever could have hoped. The 'Hope for Alexis' page received donations in excess of $76,000, a shock to her family. 'You all have shown her that dreams can come true and that the rude comments out in public can be ignored because she has so many people supporting her and rooting for her,' her family posted on the page. 'Thank you oh so very much!' The family also expressed their gratitude during a Monday interview with NBC News. 'If nothing else, we have what’s required for the hospital,' Jenny Shapiro said. 'Alexis really likes it. I think she feels like people aren’t looking at her anymore and people are rooting for her.' The girl's family was 'surprised and touched' by the outpouring of help, Ms Shapiro also said. Dr. Thomas H. Inge, of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, told NBC he plans to 'move forward as quickly as we can' with the life-saving operation. The good news came only after the ailing girl's pleas for help received international publicity. She is currently on a restricted diet of 900 to 1,400 calories per day but despite controlling her food intake, she keep's gaining weight. Remarkable: The family's cries for help raised more than they ever could have hoped, far exceeding their goal of $50,000 . 'Our reviewers have denied your request for Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass,' reads the rejection notice sent from TRICARE earlier this month. Her parents and doctors had asked that TRICARE reconsider their decision in order to save Alexis' life. NBC news reports that Alexis is gaining two pounds per week. She has been hospitalized for a kidney infection and she has developed type 2 diabetes and requires nightly insulin injections. Her pediatric obesity doctor, Dr. Thomas H. Inge of Cincinnati, believes that surgery is the only way to keep the suffering girl from gaining more weight which could top 400 pounds. Gastric bypass surgery will do more that destroy the weight, it can also tell her brain that she is not starving and she may be able to curb her painful appetite. After her surgery, Alex's parents had to take extreme measures to keep their daughter from eating herself to death. 'She’s always hungry,' her father Ian Shapiro said. 'In the past, we’ve had to padlock the cupboard.' Two years ago after developing Craniopharyngioma , a rare type of brain tumor that grows next to the pituitary gland, Alexis had surgery to have it removed. This is Alexis before she had brain surgery that caused her to develop hypothalamic obesity after doing damage to her hypothalamus . More than half of children with this specific form of tumor experience similar post-operative symptoms to Alexis. 'I think it is disappointing that they cannot see the facts of this case,' said Inge, of the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. 'There is no evidence that doing nothing would be in this child’s best interests,' he continued. According to a spokesperson for TRICARE said that gastric bypass and weight loss services are only covered of the patient is or over and has full bone growth. 'In general, our Managed Care Support Contractors are required to approve or deny coverage based on TRICARE policy,' spokesman Austin Camacho said in an email to NBC News. 'We have an appeals process in place specifically designed to give our medical professionals the opportunity to examine the details of any special cases when coverage is denied,' said the insurance company. Alexis may be a child, but she wears a women's size 1x or 2x and she goes up a size every month. When asked by psycologists about how she is coping with her condition, she has told them she 'wants to die.' If Alexis gets the surgery she may be able to lead a normal life again and keep off the weight . 'She doesn’t have any friends or anything like that,'  her mother Jenny Shapiro said. 'It’s so sad, because she remembers what it was like before.' Alexis is in constant pain and has begun homeschooling because she is afraid of going out in public. Doctor's believe that if Alexis has Bypass surgery, she may have a chance of leading a normal life. Kelsie Blackwell of Indianapolis, Indiana,21, had a successful bypass surgery when she was 18 that helped her lose 100 pounds after being diagnosed with hypothalamic obesity. Unlike Alexis, Blackwell's surgery was covered by insurance. Alexis' parents have begun to investigate other ways to raise money for their daughter's surgery. They created a Gofundme.com account to raise enough money to cover her daughter's lifelong health costs. 'These kids will literally eat themselves to death,' Jenny Shapiro said. 'That’s what I’m scared of.'","Alexis Shapiro, 12,  feels like she is constantly .

He discovered his mother and siblings riddled with bullets. It was not clear how long they had been out of contact with the teen.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:55 EST, 1 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:03 EST, 1 January 2014 . The new mayor of Detroit was sworn into office on Wednesday, and despite the New Year's Day holiday - and his limited powers in an insolvent city whose finances are controlled by a state-appointed emergency manager - he is starting work immediately. Mike Duggan was holding initial staff meetings at City Hall on Wednesday after the morning ceremony, continuing the work he has done on Detroit's behalf since voters elected him in November. With outgoing Mayor Dave Bing at his side, Duggan praised his predecessor, calling him one of his heroes. Mike Duggan was sworn in as Detroit's new mayor today, taking over during the most troubled time in the city's history . 'I'm going to continue to build on what he started, and I just want to say thank you,' Duggan said during a brief ceremony punctuated by humor and informality. The former Detroit Medical Center chief has attended a meeting of new mayors hosted by the White House, put together his own administration and lobbied with emergency manager Kevyn Orr for a greater role in the city's immediate turnaround. 'He's been engaged on issues and has been preparing to hit the ground running,' former Detroit Councilwoman Sheila Cockrel said of Duggan. So far, mayoral-type celebrations have been muted, something Cockrel said is noteworthy. 'We're broke. There is no money. Streetlights are still not on. Cops do not come on time,' said Cockrel, who is founder of a government relations advocacy firm. 'When you're in the middle of a bankruptcy, how much celebrating should you be doing? It's about the city. The most important thing for all of us now is getting the city's organization and finances in operating order.' Passing the torch: Duggan, center, shakes hands with outgoing mayor Dave Bing, left . With snow falling on the city Wednesday, Duggan was asked by reporters whether he was going to observe the work of city road crews. 'When you get elected to office, you don't automatically have all the answers,' Duggan said, drawing laughs. Under Michigan's emergency manager law, Orr has control over Detroit's finances. He filed the city's bankruptcy petition in July. On Dec. 3, federal Judge Steven Rhodes made Detroit the largest U.S. city to enter bankruptcy. 'We have a division of responsibilities that I respect,' Duggan said. 'I'm going to do the best job I can.' 'I expect that we're going to have a relationship based on the agreement we've reached,' he added. 'I'm going to disagree on some things.' Orr, who didn't attend the ceremony, was appointed by Governor Rick Snyder in March. Orr has said that Detroit has at least $18 billion in debt. He's negotiating with the city's many creditors and is expected to release a plan of adjustment for Detroit's restructuring early this month. Bing, Duggan's predecessor who didn't seek re-election, had complained of his diminished role since Orr was hired. Duggan pledged to work with the city council and the emergency manager to turn the city around . Duggan announced December 19 that he and Orr agreed to share some of the duties in running the city, with the bulk of financial responsibilities still under the emergency manager's control. 'You're going to see a lot of activity, even in the next two weeks,' Duggan said then. Under the deal with Orr, Duggan takes on blight removal, public lighting and the Fire Department, and will control financial matters relating to the day-to-day function of city government. 'I'm hopeful that with the tools that he was given ... we will see an improvement in service delivery,' said Gabe LeLand, who was elected in November to his first term on the Detroit City Council. At Wednesday's ceremony, Duggan said that he would 'be dealing with things like getting the buses running and the snow plowed and those kind of day-to-day things that people in Detroit deserve.' The nine council members already have taken their official oaths of office. Duggan will officiate at a ceremonial swearing-in for the council on Tuesday, said LeLand. The powers of the council also are restricted under the state's emergency manager law. Detroit councils and mayors have frequently been at odds, dating back decades. Duggan said Wednesday that he has met personally with the new members but acknowledged the possibility of future challenges. 'I have a very good relationship with all of the nine members. ... It always stays like that doesn't it?' Duggan asked Bing, drawing a wave of laughter.","Mike Duggan, the chief of Detroit Medical Center, is first white mayor in majority-black city since 1974 .

His father, Giuseppi della-Porta, an Italian immigrant, had arrived in Shropshire in 1848 and his first timber-framed shop expanded into several buildings and sold furniture, bedding, china, boots and shoes. Joseph, who eventually took over the family business, had a new house built in 1892, on the Mount - the same street as Charles Darwin's former family home - complete with a dark room. He was a member of Shropshire Photographic Society, was involved in the development of X-ray photography and did honorary work for the Royal Salop Infirmary.

Shocked: Tory Priti Patel uncovered the figures and said it is an insult to taxpayers that people get these huge sums . Almost 1,400 Britons are raking in more than £30,000 a year in housing benefits, it was revealed today. Taxpayers are picking up the bill for these individuals and families, with at least 100 getting in excess of £50,000 in annual rent paid for by the public purse. A lack of council housing means that some are living for free in mansions where their neighbours are the rich and famous. Tory MP for Witham in Essex, Priti Patel, dug up the shocking figures after asking a question in Parliament. In the past year 1,380 Britons got more than £30,000 in housing benefit, and of those 360 got more than £40,000 and 110 were even given in excess of £50,000. Working people would have to earn in excess of £70,000 a year to bring home that kind of income. 'Taxpayers will be appalled to know cash has been used to pay for housing benefit above and beyond what the average person earns,' Ms Patel told The Sun. 'It is disgraceful claimants are being granted homes at such a high cost to taxpayers.' It also appears that more people are claiming housing benefit as the UK slumped into its longest double-dip recession for 50 years. Housing benefit claimants hit five million in the last year - up from 4.8 million a year earlier. Next year the Coalition will bring in a housing benefit cap of £26,000 a year because of the huge sums some people are receiving. Family: Mother of eight Francesca Walker, pictured with three of her children, was put in a £2.6million Notting Hill mansion with rent paid by the taxpayer . But Labour are deeply opposed and said many, particularly in London, will become homeless because they won't be able to afford anywhere to live. But the Government is determined to slash its costs. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'It’s unacceptable that people on benefits could be getting such high amounts of state support. 'The benefit cap will come in from April next year and will ensure that people on benefits can no longer receive more in state handouts than the average wage of a hardworking family.' There have been several instances in recent years where properties owned by private landlords have been used to house families on benefits - at a great cost to taxpayers. A mother of eight told of her ‘great’ life in a £2.6million home funded by the public purse. 'Great life': Francesca Walker received more than £90,000 a year to live in this villa, with neighbours like Prime Minister David Cameron . Francesca Walker received more than £90,000 a year in benefits to pay the rent on the five-bed villa, plus other payouts. She insisted she would rather live in a normal council house, but added: ‘I’m not going to pretend this isn’t great.’ Miss Walker was housed alongside Prime Minister David Cameron, actor Hugh Grant and Four Weddings writer Richard Curtis as neighbours in fashionable Notting Hill, West London. Her four-storey home boasts five bedrooms, three bathrooms, a double living room, study and roof terrace. Speaking in 2009, Miss Walker said: ‘All my life I’ve lived in overcrowded flats on estates with gangs that kicked our door in and harassed my children. ‘We lived in some hellholes. One stank so badly we couldn’t use two rooms. Another had a gas leak that made my children ill.’ Miss Walker, whose children range from five to 16, was given the house because a new rule introduced by the Government in April forces Kensington and Chelsea council to fund suitable homes for large families. None of the available council houses was big enough, so the local authority pays for her to rent from a private landlord. Miss Walker admitted the move had caused ‘a lot of jealousy’.","1,380 Britons got more than £30,000 last year .

Some even more deluded souls have been tweeting that in fact it’s the earth celebrating its 2,014th birthday when the clock strikes 12 on Tuesday night and that great big glittery ball in Times Square drops. If some of these people are serious with their belief that the United States was formed 2014 years ago, and that New Year's Day is America's birthday, it begs the question that what exactly do they think July 4 is all about? This guy raises a good point... It's not America celebrating, it's the earth. Doh! Some people are a bit more confused than others... For other Twitter users the joke is starting to wear a bit thin... Confetti will fly over New York's Times Square after the clock strikes midnight during New Year's Eve celebrations, just don't go thinking that means America has turned 2014 .","Some ill-informed souls believe New Year's Eve ushers in the moment when Americans start celebrating the 2,014th birthday of this great nation ."

Anyone who has ever had that sinking feeling when the eyes of the person they are talking to start to glaze, take heart - an app has been developed to make you less boring. Us+ is an app for Google's Hangout video chat service that analyses what you are saying and makes suggestions based on how you are behaving. For example, if you are constantly using words that it considers too negative it will display 'try to be more positive' on the screen. Scroll down for video . Shut it: An app analyses your speech in video chats and makes suggestions based on what you say . Evasive: Us+ even tailors the things the user says to reflect the other person's statements . If you're babbling on about yourself without taking any interest in your mute conversational partner, Us+ will bluntly state: 'Stop talking about yourself so much.' It was developed by U.S. artists Lauren McCarthy and Kyle McDonald, who aim to make people more personable, but are also making a statement about modern communication. A video outlining how the app works shows 'Clare' moaning to her mother about a woman in her yoga class she percieves as selfish. After a short time she is told to be less self-absorbed, so she changes tack and asks her mother how she is. Word in edgeways: If one person blathers on for more than a minute their microphone is disconnected . Her mother answers the question vaguely . and slightly evasively, hinting at a problem in her life but revealing . little, so Us+ accuses: 'What are you hiding? Clare is speaking much . more honestly.' Another interesting - and potentially very useful - feature is demonstrated in another dialogue example: The automute. Us+ uses Linguistic Inquiry and Word . Count, a text analysis software programme that calculates the degree to . which people use different categories of words when they communicate. It . determines whether the speaker is using positive or negative emotions, . self-references, causal words, and other language patterns. It also uses Linguistic Style . Matching, which analyses the tendency of participants in a conversation . to use a common vocabulary and similar sentence structures. If you speak for longer than a minute . the app automatically switches off your microphone so the other person . can have their say.

By . SIMON JONES . PUBLISHED: . 10:03 EST, 9 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:04 EST, 10 December 2013 . This is . the Transfer Column, where Sportsmail delivers the very latest news, . gossip and rumours from around the football world three times a week. In . today's column: In-demand Basle winger Mohamed Salah could be on his way to Liverpool after being spotted at Anfield, Barcelona have joined Manchester United and Real Madrid in the chase for Ilkay Gundogen and Yohan Cabaye still has eyes for PSG. Liverpool's pursuit of Egyptian star Mohamed Salah seems to be reaching its climactic point after his European representative was spotted at Anfield on Saturday. In-demand: Basle's Mohamed Salah has attracted interest from the likes of Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United . Salah has been grabbing headlines with Swiss side Basle for the past 12 months and his performances in the Champions League against Chelsea, in particular, this season have made him one of the hottest properties of the January window. Basle are willing to sell the 21-year-old who has been dubbed 'the Egyptian Messi' for around £15million. He can play anywhere across the front line, is technically good and has blistering pace. He has scored six goals in 22 games for Basle this season and 17 in 26 internationals for his country. Sportsmail revealed Liverpool's interest in September and it follows interest from Tottenham who have maintained a watching brief. Also interested: Tottenham . Also interested: United . Also interested: Chelsea . Tottenham sporting director Franco Baldini watched Salah against Chelsea in November but they may hold off bidding for him with a central striker more their priority for January. Chelsea and Manchester United have also shown interest in Salah but they will also face competition from the likes of Inter Milan and Monaco. United's concern has been who actually represents him with various agents claiming to have the mandate to represent him. However, it is German-based SPOCS agency, with directors Aylmer Woods and Sascha Empacher, who are understood to be the contracted representatives in Europe. Classy: Basle are expected to listen to offers of £10m for defender Fabian Schar . Similar questions have been raised about Salah's club-mate Fabian Schar. The classy centre-back has attracted attention from Tottenham, Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and others. Basle were unwilling to sell the 21-year-old in January initially but they sense the interest is that strong they will relent if anyone offers around £10million. Schar does not have an agent as such but uses a lawyer for negotiations. However, he is no intellectual slouch himself having qualified as a Swiss banker with Raiffeisen. Dundee United's Tannadice Park has seen attendances boosted by the arrival of scouts from far and wide of late. Ryan Gauld has been the name on most people's lips while defender John Souttar and left-back Andy Robertson are also coming under close scrutiny. Teenage kicks: 17-year-old Ryan Gauld has been attracting scouts to Dundee United . The 17-year-old Gauld voiced a desire to sample life abroad at the weekend and he could get his wish. Roma and Juventus were among those represented in the stands during Saturday's 4-1 defeat of Hearts. Gauld had a quite game by his standards but they will be back while Everton, Liverpool, Arsenal, Sunderland and Manchester United have been regular visitors. Wolves goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey is being watched by West Ham United. The 26-year-old is fully fit again after a cruciate injury last year and a knee injury in August. He had a loan spell at Yeovil and returned to action for Wales in November. Sam Allardyce is looking for back-up for Jussi Jaaskelainen and Wolves are open to offers. One in, one out? Wayne Hennesey has been lined up as a replacement for Jussi Jaaskelainen at West Ham, . Hennessey was a keeper with great potential at one stage and is keen to get his career back on track after a couple of setbacks. Liverpool, who have been scouting the likes of Lee Nicholls at Wigan, are also interested in Hennessey. Manager Brendan Rodgers wants to increase competition with Brad Jones and Simon Mignolet. Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina is poised to move on permanently following his loan spell at Napoli. The Italians, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan and Arsenal are all maintaining interest in the Spain international with a deal likely for around £4.5million. Barcelona are the latest side to make contact with the father of Ilkay Gundogan. The Borussia Dortmund midfielder is in demand with Real Madrid and Manchester United both keen to take him away from Germany. German engineering: Ilkay Gundogan is a target for Manchester United, Real Madrid and now Barcelona . Irfan, Ilkay's father, insists a deal has yet to be agreed with Real despite strong suspicions one is in place and Dortmund acknowledging the player could go. That has prompted clubs to make more discreet enquiries with Irfan in the hope of gaining a footing in a deal that would cost around £24million. Real Madrid are awaiting a decision imminently from Xabi Alonso on his future which could affect their next target and they are keeping a keen eye on the ongoing chatter that Paul Pogba's is unsettled at Juventus. QPR are keeping a keen interest in Bradford City striker Nakhi Wells. Bradford are resigned to losing the 23-year-old who has 18 months left on contract. Hot shot: Bradford are resigned to losing Nakhi Wells who has scored 14 goals this season . Leicester City, Nottingham Forest and Leeds United are also interested but Bradford want around £3million for the Bermuda international who has 14 goals this season. Bradford chairman Julian Rhodes admitted: 'He can probably earn a lot more elsewhere, so if that’s the case and Nahki is not going to be here beyond this contract, we have to look at any offers if they come in, whether that’s in the next transfer window or the one after that.' Yohan Cabaye has failed to dampen the speculation surrounding a pending move to Paris St Germain. French fancy: Newcastle midfielder Yohan Cabaye has not ruled out a move to big spending PSG . Speaking on French TV beIN SPORT, the Newcastle midfielder said: 'As far as I know, there has been no contact with Paris Saint-Germain. Who wouldn't want to join PSG today?' Newcastle want Cabaye to stay until the summer but an offer of around £16million would be difficult to resist. Which international Premier League striker asked a girl on a date and when she refused promised to turn up at her shop every day until she relented. Four days later he sent in a friend to say 'Don't you know who he is?' The girl nodded before replying 'Yes and my boyfriend thinks he's rubbish too.' The agent of Balazs Dzsudzsak, Jozsef Vorosbaranyi has played down talk that Fulham are close to signing the £12m-rated Hungarian winger from Dinamo Moscow. 'Fulham haven't contacted us, we haven't had talks,' Vorosbaranyi told SportKlub Television. 'When Martin Jol was their coach we had been in touch as he wanted to sign Balazs several times. But seeing the budget of Fulham I don't think they could've been able to make an agreement. Feeling Hungary? Fulham are reported to be close to the £12m rated Balazs Dzsudzsak . 'The fee Dinamo would have asked for the player might not be suitable for the English club. Now they have a new Dutch coach, I'm sure he knows Balazs well but we haven't had talks with them.' Luuk De Jong has been discussed by Stoke City as their search for a striker continues. The 23-year-old surprised many suitors last year when he opted to join Borussia Monchengladbach from FC Twente in a £12m deal. He has struggled to live up to his price tag in Germany and that has alerted the likes of Stoke to ask about a deal although the Germans would like to recoup their money. Going Potty: Luuk De Jong (left) could escape his Bundesliga struggles with a move to Stoke . Everton have added Alfred Finnbogasson to their list of striker targets, as reported in today's Daily Mirror, but Heerenveen want close to £8million for the Iceland international who has also interested West Ham, Newcastle and Celtic. Cardiff are another Premier League side considering strikers in January. Manchester City's John Guidetti remains on the lists of many with clubs as diverse as Liverpool and Real Betis understood to be mulling over offers. Saints alive! Southampton are the latest club interested in Rennes' Jonathan Pitroipa (left) Southampton are among clubs watching Burkina Faso winger Jonathan Pitroipa at Rennes. Monaco will challenge Chelsea for St Etienne bad boy Kurt Zouma. The 19-year-old defender is in demand although his 10 game suspension for his horrendous challenge on Sochaux's Thomas Guerbert has made it difficult for scouts to update reports ahead of January.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:42 EST, 3 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:22 EST, 3 January 2014 . Military health insurance officials are rethinking a decision to deny weight-loss surgery to a 12-year-old girl who is obese due to a rare medical condition. TRICARE, which provides medical insurance to Alexis Shapiro's father Ian Shapiro, is reviewing her case after the family appealed the decision. Alexis Shapiro suffers from hypothalmic obesity, which has caused her to pack on more than 140 pounds in two years. Alexis Shapiro is obese but feels like she's starving and needs gastric bypass surgery in order to survive . With the U.S. military unwilling to pay for Alexis Shapiro's $50,000 operation, her family turned to crowd-funding and found success - to the tune of more than $78,000 so far. The four-foot-seven-inch girl weighs 200 pounds and is gaining two pounds each week. Her condition was triggered by surgery she had two years ago to remove a benign brain tumor. During the operation, her hypothalmus and pituitary gland, which help govern appetite and weight, were damaged. She now feels constantly hungry and her weight has caused other medical conditions. In just the past three months, Alexis was hospitalized for a kidney infection and developed Type 2 diabetes that requires nightly insulin injections. After the military rejected their initial request, the young girl's family was afraid the appeal process would take longer than she had. 'These kids will literally eat themselves to death,' mother Jenny Shapiro said. 'That’s what I’m scared of.' The outpouring of love and funds on the 'Hope for Alexis' GoFundMe page gave hope to Alexis, whose condition has caused her to withdraw into her shell. She is now home-schooled and has no friends. 'You all have shown her that dreams can come true and that the rude comments out in public can be ignored because she has so many people supporting her and rooting for her,' her family posted on the page. 'Thank you oh so very much!' Dr. Thomas H. Inge, of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, told NBC he plans to 'move forward as quickly as we can' with the life-saving operation. Alexis is currently on a restricted diet of 900 to 1,400 calories per day but despite controlling her food intake, she keeps gaining weight. Complications: Alexis Shapiro has faced a host of medical problems stemming from a benign brain tumor she had removed two years ago . Remarkable: The family's cries for help raised more than they ever could have hoped, far exceeding their goal of $50,000 . 'Our reviewers have denied your request for Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass,' reads the rejection notice sent from TRICARE earlier this month. Her parents and doctors have asked that TRICARE reconsider their decision in order to save Alexis' life. Her pediatric obesity doctor, Dr. Thomas H. Inge of Cincinnati, believes that surgery is the only way to keep the suffering girl from gaining more weight which could top 400 pounds. Gastric bypass surgery will do more that destroy the weight, it can also tell her brain that she is not starving and she may be able to curb her painful appetite. After her brain surgery, Alex's parents had to take extreme measures to keep their daughter from eating herself to death. 'She’s always hungry,' her father Ian Shapiro said. 'In the past, we’ve had to padlock the cupboard.' This is Alexis before she had brain surgery that caused her to develop hypothalamic obesity after doing damage to her hypothalamus . More than half of children with the specific form of tumor Alexis had experience similar post-operative symptoms. 'I think it is disappointing that they cannot see the facts of this case,' said Inge, of the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. 'There is no evidence that doing nothing would be in this child’s best interests,' he continued. According to a spokesperson for TRICARE said that gastric bypass and weight loss services are only covered of the patient is 18 or over and has full bone growth. 'In general, our Managed Care Support Contractors are required to approve or deny coverage based on TRICARE policy,' spokesman Austin Camacho said in an email to NBC News. 'We have an appeals process in place specifically designed to give our medical professionals the opportunity to examine the details of any special cases when coverage is denied,' said the insurance company. Alexis may be a child, but she wears a women's size 1x or 2x and she goes up a size every month. When asked by psychologists about how she is coping with her condition, she has told them she 'wants to die.' If Alexis gets the surgery she may be able to lead a normal life again and keep off the weight . 'She doesn’t have any friends or anything like that,'  her mother Jenny Shapiro said. 'It’s so sad, because she remembers what it was like before.' Doctor's believe that if Alexis has Bypass surgery, she may have a chance of leading a normal life. TRICARE officials told NBC that the initial application for Alexis' weight loss surgery was denied because the paperwork didn't contain enough detail. 'The reason for this surgery request was simply ""morbid obesity."" There was no information indicating that this patient had a rare disease (panhypopituitarism),' said spokesman Austin Comacho. 'If the family had initiated the appeal process, as informed in the denial letter, all this would have come to light right away.' Jenny Shapiro says that if TRICARE decides to pay for her daughter's surgery, the money donated will go towards Alexis' travel from Texas to Ohio for the surgery, medical therapy and medication. Anything left over will go towards helping other sick children. 'Alexis always wanted to help all the other kids every time we have been admitted,' her mother says.","Alexis Shapiro, 12,  has a rare medical condition that causes her to feel constantly hungry .

The leader of the English Defence League today admitted the far-right group has 'completely questionable' tactics in a controversial interview in which he called for a ban on the building of mosques in Britain. Tommy Robinson also denied that his followers were responsible for a fire at an Islamic centre in London last week, suggesting that it may in fact have been the work of Muslims. The BBC has been criticised for running the interview with Robinson on Radio 4's Today programme, with some listeners claiming that it gave a 'non-critical platform' for his extremist views. A number of prominent journalists and politicians criticised the BBC's decision to interview Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.Former Labour MP Denis McShane directed his anger at presenter Sarah Montague, tweeting: 'Now Today provides non-critical platform for EDL. Has she ever seen them close up? Heard their racist insults? Violence threats?' Former Ed Miliband adviser and Labour . parliamentary candidate Polly Billington also tweeted: 'Our communities will . suffer the consequences of this legitimisation of the EDL. @BBCr4today . -totally out of touch.' Director of think tank British Future Sunder Katwala added: 'Big @BBCr4today #EDL flaw to take at face value false statements from man with both violence & fraud convictions' The EDL leader has returned to prominence following the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich, which has led to an increase in anti-Islamic sentiments in some quarters. Mr Robinson, 30, tried to strike a conciliatory tone over some issues, saying he condemned attacks against Muslims and would not allow EDL members to make Nazi salutes. However, he insisted that his group had nothing to do with a fire which partially destroyed an Islamic community centre in Muswell Hill last week, even though the building was daubed with the initials 'EDL'. 'If something was set fire and someone wrote ""David Cameron"" on the side of it, does it mean he did it?,' he said. 'It just seems ridiculous to me and I think everyone can see through it that that's done to make it look like the English Defence League. 'If I'm honest, I'm completely sceptical that it is even non-Muslims that have done that.' Mr Robinson added: 'Our tactics are completely . questionable, yes, and I understand people who say you are going about . it the wrong way, but what choice do we have as working-class people, . who, as soon as you put your head above the parapet, you're called a . racist or a fascist? Who wants to sit down and talk to us?' He did not explain exactly what he meant by 'questionable tactics', but the EDL is known for holding large rallies near . mosques and heavily Muslim areas, while adopting a confrontational . attitude which has previously led to clashes with anti-fascist . protesters and Muslim activists. 'The . non-Muslim community working class don't have a voice,' he continued. 'Where will it . end? It's not going to end pretty at the minute is it, when you look . what's going on.' Memorial: Robinson leaving a floral tribute to Drummer Lee Rigby, whose death has led to a surge in the public attention paid to the EDL over the past few weeks . The EDL leader went on to say that . Muslims should not be allowed to construct new places of worship until . they implement a wholesale reform of their religion. 'I'd . stop the building of mosques in this country until Islam reforms and . works in this country with Western democracy and freedom,' he said. Asked if he would condemn attacks by his members on Muslims, he replied: 'Utterly condemn it, disgraceful. 'Every single speech I gave since Woolwich, in fact in the last four years, condemn any acts of violence. So the only way to solve this is through democratic process, through peacefully protesting.' Asked if he condemned any EDL member who gave a Nazi salute, he said: 'Well, I think if I was standing next to them there'd be a violent act. If you look into our history, I was actually arrested for assaulting someone doing that at our demonstrations.' Anger: But the EDL is dedicated to peaceful protest, according to its leader Mr Robinson . Mr Robinson said that, if the EDL were in power, all Islamist preachers would be automatically jailed, saying: 'When they're calling for the implementation of Sharia law and to overthrow our Queen and our democracy, we'd intern them.' He added that he believed his mission was to 'wake the British public up' and alert people to the danger posed by Islamic extremism, claiming, 'There's 100 Sharia law courts operating in this country.' While insisting that 'all face coverings should be banned in public', including Islamic burqas and masks worn during protests, Mr Robinson said he understood why some EDL members covered their faces while demonstrating. 'Do you blame any person who's got a job within a council, say, and lives near a Muslim area, who wants to cover their face?', he asked. He also claimed that he had been personally targeted by Islamic radicals, saying: 'I myself have had four official Osman warnings, I've been dragged out of my car, my children have been threatened to be decapitated.' Attack: An Islamic centre in Muswell Hill was burnt down and 'EDL' was daubed on the side of the building . But Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire said of allowing the leader on the show: 'Woeful interview with convicted footie hoolie Stephen Lennon aka EDL's Tommy Robinson. He'll laugh all the way to next EDL brawl.' The director of the British Future think tank, Sunder Katwala, added: 'Big @BBCr4today #EDL flaw to take at face value false statements from man with both violence & fraud convictions.' And Al-Jazeera presenter and Huffington Post political director Mehdi Hasan posted a blog with a list of ten questions he felt Radio 4 presenter Sarah Montague could have asked but did not. He added: 'Put to one side for a moment the vexed issue of whether 'preachers of hate' such as Robinson or Al Muhajiroun's Anjem Choudary should even be given such high-profile platforms by national broadcasters. 'The bigger issue with this particular interview was that there was very little probing of Robinson's background or views; his offensive and conspiratorial claims about British Muslims and Islam were left largely unchallenged; the tone of the questions was polite and - dare I say - soft, rather than tough, rigorous or challenging.' Labour Party member James Mills tweeted: 'The @BBCr4today interview with EDL leader Tommy Robinson was shocking, poorly researched interview prep, didnt challenge his false claims...' Earlier this year, Mr Robinson was briefly imprisoned after he was convicted of attempting to travel to the U.S. using someone else's passport. A BBC spokesman said: 'Today's programme looked at the recent rise in Islamaphobic attacks, such as the recent arson attack on a London mosque. 'The BBC has a responsibility to both report on the story and to try to offer insight into why it is happening. The EDL are a key part of the story and we believe it is important to reflect the fact that opinions such as those of Tommy Robinson exist. 'His views were challenged and we spoke to guests with alternative opinions elsewhere in the programme.'","Tommy Robinson controversially interviewed on Today programme .

"By . Sara Malm . PUBLISHED: . 06:39 EST, 3 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:34 EST, 3 January 2014 . The head coach of Florida State University has told of the heartbreaking battle for his young son who suffers from a rare blood disorder. Jimbo Fisher’s eight-year-old boy Ethan has Fanconi Anemia, a genetic illness which may not see him live beyond the age of 20. As Fisher prepares to take his team to the BCS National Championship Game next week, he also campaigns to raise awareness of Ethan’s illness to improve his chances of making it to adulthood. Father and son: Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher with his son, Ethan, who has Fanconi Anemia, a rare genetic blood disorder . Although his team is undefeated this season - the FSU Seminoles have won all 13 games this year – Mr Fisher’s greatest success is that it has raising the profile of Fanconi Anemia. The family discovered that Ethan was ill in 2010 when Jimbo's wife Candi took their youngest son to an urgent care clinic with flu. A blood test revealed a low platelet count and after follow up tests Ethan was diagnosed. ‘All we knew about the disease was what we looked up online,’ Mr Fisher told CNN. ‘It was all the worst-case scenarios. We thought it was a complete death sentence. That day was... devastation.’ Nearly all Fanconi Anemia sufferers require a bone marrow transplant, but although it buys time, it does not cure the illness and the recovery time can be up to a year. The average lifespan for a Fanconi Anemia patient is 20 to 30 years. Coaching life: Mr Fisher has set up a charity to raise awareness of his son's illness in the hope that it will improve his and other sufferers chances of making it to adulthood . ‘Time isn't really on our side, or anybody's side, with this disease,’ Mrs Fisher says. Since the Fishers went public with Ethan's diagnosis in 2011, all Florida State Union players have signed up to become bone marrow donors, and several have already helped children in need by donating. Blood disorder Fanconi Anemia affects 1 in 350,000 births. Sufferers have a genetic defect in their DNA repairm resulting in production of faulty cells, which can lead to birth defects, cancer and bone marrow failure. They also run a 15,000 higher risk of developing blood cell cancer acute myeloid leukemia and 90 per cent need bone marrow transplants before the age of 30.

The house of the future could be built from plastic and look like a spider's web, if one group of conceptual architects have their way. London-based architecture collective Softkill Design have created this concept for the first 3D printed house, and say the first prototype could be built by this summer. They are the latest entrants to a race to construct the first 3D printed home, which could revolutionise house building and even potentially solve the UK's housing crisis. Scroll down for video . The house of the future? This incredible design . for a 3D printed home has been proposed by London-based architecture . collective Softkill Design. The group, who are the latest to join the race to create the first 3D-printable home, say the first prototype could be built . as soon as this summer . 'It would take up to three weeks to have all the pieces fabricated,' said Gilles Retsin, a member of the collective, to Dezeen.com. 'Assembly on site is a one-day job, if the site is prepared before hand.' He told the site that the house would stick together with velcro or button-like fasteners, dispensing with the need for traditional building techniques. The proposal is a development of an earlier prototype printed house which was unveiled last October at the 3D Print Show in London, which, instead of solid walls, featured a fibrous nylon structure based on bones. Protohouse 2.0, as it is known, takes the same minimalist approach, using just enough plastic material to maintain structural integrity. Like a spider's web: The proposal is a development of an . earlier prototype printed house which was unveiled last October at the . 3D Print Show in London, which, instead of solid walls, featured a . fibrous nylon structure based on bone . Components will be manufactured off-site at existing 3D printing plants in laser-sintered bioplastic, which Mr Retsin said is will give better quality than printing on site with sand or concrete, as others have suggested. He told Dezeen: 'These highly fibrous structures are only 0.7 millimetres thick. 'It's impossible to print those with stone, because there's not enough structure or strength or integrity in sand. In the factory environment you can go into stronger materials like plastics or metals.' Components would be built off site and the house would . stick together with velcro or button-like fasteners, dispensing with the . need for traditional building techniques . The cost of building the house has not been revealed, but Mr Retsin said the improved economies of scale offered by the burgeoning 3D printing industry means such homes could be economically competitive in the 'near future'. Mr Retsin dismissed a rival 3D printed house project announced by Dutch studio Universe Architecture, since the proposal was only to print the formwork then complete the structure in concrete. 'So it's not that the actual building is 3D printed,' he said.","Concept put together by London-based architecture collective Softkill Design .

A body has been found in a Minneapolis home that exploded on New Year's Day and police are still working to identify the victim. The Thursday discovery marked the first fatality from the explosion while 14 others are said to be recovering from injuries, six of which were critical. Some of the victims suffered burns, while others suffered trauma as they jumped to the ground from windows on the third floor. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Extremes: An explosion at this Minneapolis, Minnesota apartment building on New Year's Day left at least one person dead and 14 others injured . Investigation: Fire officials believe that the explosion was caused by natural gas but energy company executives say that they are drawing their conclusions too soon . Horrible: One person was found dead among the ruins but their identity has not yet been confirmed and two residents remain missing . 'At approximately 1.55pm Minneapolis Fire Department officials confirmed that one body was discovered in the structure at 516 Cedar Ave. S,' assistant fire chief Cherie A. Penn told The Star Tribune. Two people who lived in a second-floor apartment are still said to be missing and unaccounted for- named by relatives as 57-year-old Alhmad Ali and 60-year-old Mrimri Farah- and it is not known if either of them was the fatality. The fatal incident is still under investigation but fire chief John Fruetel told the paper that it is believed to be the result of a natural gas leak as there is a distinctive smell in the surrounding area and witness reports would support the theory. That contradicts gas company CenterPoint Energy's claims that they do not believe natural gas was connected to the fatal incident. Lingering questions: A spokesman for the local energy company said that if it were a natural gas explosion, the roof and walls would have likely been blown off . Difficult: Firemen said that as they were spraying water to extinguish the flames, the water was freezing . 'We had no natural gas in the area,' spokeswoman Rebecca Virden told The Tribune. She went on to say that if natural gas was the cause, the roof would have likely 'come off, the wall would come out' but Mr Fruetel stood by the reports made by his investigators. The three-story building, 516 Cedar Avenue, is very close to a local mosque and houses a grocery store and several apartments. Ten of the building's apartments were occupied.

Desperate: A man is seen climbing from a window towards a ladder in a desperate bid to escape the fire . Freezing conditions: The fire chief said his staff were working in 'treacherous conditions' to put out the flames . Emergency responders received the first reports of the explosion at 8.16am on Wednesday, Minneapolis Fire officials told WCCO, and arrived on the scene within minutes - but after 15 minutes they were forced to evacuate the building due to dangerous conditions.

A man who has been blind from birth accepted a challenge to guess the colors of scented markers by relying on his sense of smell alone. Tommy Edison hosts a YouTube channel where he answers questions people who have the gift of sight pose about the experiences of blind people. For his latest video in the series The Tommy Edison Experience, the YouTube host was asked by one of his followers to guess the colors of Mr Sketch scented markers by giving them a whiff. Scroll down for video . Sixth scent: Blind YouTube host Tommy Edison created a video in which he tried to guess the colors of scented markers by smelling them . Colorful challenge: Edison predicted that he would be able to correctly identify four of nine colors . Wrong answer: Edison got the experiment off the wrong foot by erroneously guessing that the lemon-scented (left) and orange (right) markers were red . For his experiment, Mr Edison selected nine markers: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink brown and black. Before getting down to business, the jovial host predicted that he would correctly identify four of the hues - an impressive feat considering that Mr Edison has never experienced colors. The guessing game begins with a yellow marker that is supposed to give off a lemony scent. Edison removes the cap and sniffs the marker, trying to form an association between the aroma and the hue it represents. 'It smells like a can of Hawaiian punch or something like that,' he muses before erroneously concluding that the marker is red. Smell of success: Edison¿s luck finally turns when he correctly guesses that the mint-scented marker is green . The YouTube host repeats his mistake with the orange marker, which he again misidentifies as red. 'I'm going to guess that that smells like grape. Therefore, if I know my food and colors right, it would be purple?' he says in the clip while holding a red, cherry-scented marker to his nose. 'This game is not easy,’ he laments. Edison’s luck finally turns when he correctly guesses that the mint-scented marker is green and the one that smells like liquorice is black. 'Look at me go, I'm on fire!' he exclaims with a grin. But Edison's nose fails him yet again when he encounters a pink, watermelon scented Mr Sketch marker, which he guesses to be brown. Edison also has no luck with a blueberry scent, which he mixes up with grape. Color blind: Edison's nose failed him when he encountered a pink, watermelon scented marker, but he scored a victory by correctly identifying the color of the grape-scented marker as purple . Mission accomplished: In the end, the jovial host was able to correctly identify four of the markers - an impressive outcome considering that Mr Edison has never experienced colors . 'You might say I blew this one,' he quips. Edison scores another victory by correctly identifying the color of the grape-scented marker as purple. For the final test, Edison gives a cinnamon-scented marker a sniff, which he mistakes for chocolate, but correctly guesses that it’s brown. In some of his recent videos, Edison has tried to explain how blind people use paper money and a computer; what happens when a blind person gets drunk; how to make pizza when you're blind and what do blind people find attractive. The affable middle-age man also takes on tasks such as cooking alone, using a DVD player and using an ATM to give his viewers an insight into how he is lives his life. Mr Edison also reviews movies from the perspective of a blind person.","Tommy Edison hosts YouTube series where he offers insights on everyday experiences of blind people .

Christian Taylor was sentenced to 27 months in jail after stealing nearly £100,000 from church funds . A church treasurer who stole £100,000 from ecclesiastical funds by forging the signature of the vicar, has been sentenced to more than two years behind bars. Christian Taylor was responsible for the bank accounts of St Nicholas Church in Great Kimble and All Saints Church in Little Kimble, Buckinghamshire. But two months into his voluntary role as treasurer, the 61-year-old started to line his own pockets. Taylor made a series of false claims to the Listed Places of Worship (LPW) Scheme - a Government programme that allows churches to claim back VAT on building works. The four claims, totaling £54,535, were made using the forged signature of Janet Henderson, the newly appointed vicar of the two churches. Once the money from the false claims landed in the church bank accounts, Taylor transferred the cash to himself. In addition Taylor stole another £42,358 from other church funds. Prosecutor Rachel Drake told Aylesbury Crown Court said Taylor's crimes had gone undetected for two years. She said the 61-year-old started as treasurer in May 2008, but it was not until May 2010, when a new manager at the Natwest branch where the Kimble church accounts were held, that Taylor's wrongdoing was exposed. 'Kay Smith, the new manager, was concerned about the frequency with which the defendant was going into the bank and withdrawing cash from the church accounts,' Miss Drake told the court. She said Taylor was sometimes spotted in the bank branch several times a day. Mrs Smith wrote to one of the signatories of the church accounts, Michael Smith, but Taylor told him he would deal with the issue. In July 2010 Taylor met with the bank, with a man pretending to be Mr Smith, who said the church was happy with his work. Taylor began lining his own pockets with money through false claims to recoup VAT on building works that were never carried out, two months into his voluntary role at St Nicholas Church in Great Kimble, above . A spot-check made on behalf of the LPW scheme involved a check made with an architect listed on one of Taylor's claims. When asked if there was an invoice for the work allegedly carried out, the architect said no invoice existed. When police arrested Taylor in March 2011, officers discovered one of the fake invoices saved on his computer. 'Police have been trying to identify . the other person who must have been working alongside this defendant but . he said he can’t remember the meeting at the bank,' said Miss Drake. 'Not . only has this put the church council into severe financial . difficulties, it has also had a detrimental effect on relationships in . this community.' The court was told Taylor had a string of previous convictions for theft dating from the 1960s and 70s, including theft by an employee in 1971. Martin Bloor, defending Taylor, told Judge . Sheridan: 'He accepts his behaviour showed planning and sophistication . in relation to the documents used.' The court heard £54,000 had yet to be recovered and that Taylor suffered from mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. Taylor, who was also treasurer for All Saints Church in Little Kimble, pictured, was only found out after a new bank manager at the Natwest branch. which held the church accounts, spotted the unusual goings on . 'He says he did not intend to hurt . anybody personally but accepts it has and is ashamed of the effect it . has had on these people,' said Mr Bloor. Judge Sheridan said Taylor, from Stokenchurch, acted 'deliberately . and systematically' in beginning the fraud so soon after his appointment . in May 2008. 'Everybody . took you on face value as a thoroughly good egg, but sure as eggs is . eggs, they did not know about your old convictions,' he said. He said Rev. Henderson, Mr Smith and all other church . representatives were blameless victims of Taylor’s fraud, which had also . cost the church council more than £22,000 in legal fees and investigations. 'I . wish to pay tribute to the bank manager, who excelled in her vigilance . in keeping a close eye on the affairs of her customers,' he said. Taylor, . who works as a telephone canvasser and admitted the crimes, was sentenced to a . total of 27 months in prison for two charges of fraud and two of transferring criminal property. A third charge of fraud and one of . possession of articles for use in fraud were ordered to lie on file. An order to recover the money under the Proceeds of Crime Act was also made, a hearing is due to take place on March 14.","Christian Taylor started to line his own pockets two months into his voluntary role as treasurer of two Buckinghamshire churches .

In 2002 a previously unknown star stunned stargazers when it suddenly flared up to briefly become the brightest star in the sky. The star, V838 Monocerotis, produced a stellar flash so brilliant that scientists had never seen anything like it before - then, just as suddenly, it faded. A stellar flash like this was unprecedented because supernovas and novas typically expel matter out into space, often obscuring them from view. Scroll down for video . Poetry of heaven: Nasa has released an image of the 'light echo' produced by the glare from a star that was, for one brief shining moment, the brightest in the night sky . It is light from a stellar explosion echoing off dust surrounding the star. V838 Monocerotis produced enough energy in a brief flash to illuminate surrounding dust, like a spelunker taking a flash picture of the walls of an undiscovered cavern. The star presumably ejected the illuminated dust shells in previous outbursts. Light from the latest outburst travels to the dust and then is reflected to Earth. Because of this indirect path, the light arrives at Earth months after light from the star that traveled directly toward Earth. Now Nasa has released an artist's . impression, created using the Hubble Space Telescope, that appears to . show V838 expel material into space, but what we are actually seeing is an outwardly moving 'light echo' of the bright flash - about a million times solar luminosity - from 11 years ago. According to Nasa, in a light echo, light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant rings in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star. It is still not known what caused the flare, but theories include an eruption caused by helium eruptions as the star entered its death throes, the swallowing of planets by V838 or that V838 is a very massive supergiant that underwent a thermonuclear event. The expansion took only a couple of months, meaning that its speed was abnormal. A paper with contributions from the US Naval Observatory, the University of Arizona and the European Space Agency concluded: 'When combined with the high luminosity and unusual outburst behavior, these characteristics indicate that V838 Mon represents a hitherto unknown type of stellar outburst, for which we have no completely satisfactory physical explanation.' V838 Mon lies about 20,000 light years away toward the constellation of the unicorn (hence the name Monoceros), while the light echo in the image spans about six light years in diameter. It appears that the star is considerably more massive and luminous than . the Sun, perhaps five to ten times as big.

Setback: The vision of independence set out by Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon risks the Scottish economy and would see businesses flee to England, experts warn . Alex . Salmond's separatist vision was dismissed as 'economically incoherent'; . there were warnings that 'skilled labour' would leave; and creating a . new border would cut gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as 3 per . cent. The findings are particularly humiliating for Deputy First . Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who yesterday predicted the economy would be . the key battleground in the referendum campaign. The . Financial Times asked a number of high-profile economists and eminent . university professors to examine the impact of a Nationalist victory in . September. In a daunting verdict, 27 respondents said it would hurt the . Scottish economy and the rest of the UK. Only four people who took part in the survey said a Yes vote could have a positive impact. Former . Chancellor Alistair Darling, who is leading the pro-Union Better . Together campaign, said the findings prove that the 'risks involved in . leaving the UK are massive'. But a spokesman for the Yes Scotland campaign insisted separation would 'encourage growth and increase employment'. Referendum: Voters in Scotland will have their saying on leaving the UK this autumn . Farmers . are overwhelmingly set to reject independence, according to a survey. Scots Lib Dem MEP George Lyon received 2,000 replies to a study he . conducted, with 72 per cent of respondents supporting the Union. Three-quarters of farmers expressed concern about the impact separation could have on EU agricultural subsidies. Four-fifths . said uncertainty over currency would harm their businesses, while 72 . per cent feared separation would make it difficult to sell produce in . the rest of the UK. Mr . Lyon said: 'Everyone wants to see a thriving Scottish rural economy, . but if you look at the real positives we get from the UK market, from . our place in Europe and our trade links overseas, our farmers can . achieve more as part of the UK family. 'Scotland's . place in the EU is not only vital for farmers, but also for jobs and . growth.' But Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead has claimed . farmers would have been handed an extra £1billion in European subsidies . if Scotland were separate. Philip Rush of Japanese finance giant Nomura launched a stinging attack on the SNP vision. 'Higher . taxes on income would push many wealthy individuals and some companies . they work for south of the Border, harming Scotland's economy,' he said. 'A fate similar to the secular stagnation in productivity seen in parts . of Europe's socialist south may await.' Ruth Porter of the Policy . Exchange think-tank was similarly dismissive, saying: 'The raft of . economically incoherent policies being proposed by Alex Salmond would be . disastrous for Scotland.' Gavyn Davies of Fulcrum Asset Management . described a Yes vote as an 'unmitigated disaster for Scotland' as did . Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC bank. One . of the main results of an SNP victory in the referendum would be the . loss of companies - and jobs - to England, several experts said. Keith . Wade, chief economist of asset management firm Schroders, commented: . 'When combined with the considerable uncertainty over whether Scotland . can remain in the EU, Scottish business would start to head south.' David . Owen, chief European financial economist with investment firm Jeffries, . said: 'Scotland is likely to see an ongoing loss of business as it . migrates south of the Border.' Andrew . Hilton of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation warned: 'If . there were a Yes vote there would be utter panic - with the Scottish . fund managers heading for the Border in droves.' Neville . Hill of Credit Suisse bank said: 'The flow of direct and portfolio . investment, as well as some bank deposits, south of the Border would . provide Scotland with a nasty negative monetary shock.' Many of those . taking part in the survey said uncertainty would devastate the economy. James . Knightley of banking giant ING said: 'I think the uncertainty will be . damaging for everyone ... it is going to make a lot of foreign companies . think twice about investing in the UK.' Melanie .

'It would create major uncertainty about the viability of the country . as an economic unit. Growth would be hurt.' Ray .

But despite the strong warnings Miss Sturgeon said yesterday: ‘I . firmly believe who wins the economic argument will win the referendum. ‘Scotland can more than afford to be independent, . something that even the No campaign agrees with. We need the powers over the . economy to get faster and more sustainable growth into the economy for the long . term.’ A spokesman for Yes Scotland added: ‘The greatest . uncertainty for business as well as the country as a whole stems from a ‘No’ vote.

The article was based on a long interview Scalfari had with the Pope earlier in the year, though Scalfari admits that he did not take notes or use a recording device during the conversation. Instead he said he had reconstructed it from memory, adding a few passages to make the article flow better. It is not the first time Scalfari, who founded the newspaper in 1976, has fallen foul of senior Catholics. The Vatican had hosted a script of the conversation on its website, but has now removed sections of it claiming they were 'inaccurate'. In his first year as pontiff following the resignation of Emeritus Pope Benedict earlier in 2013, Pope Francis has become a much-loved figure throughout the world. Francis has become one of 2013's most loved personalities after acts of humility - inculcating kissing this sufferer of neurofibramatosis - saw him win Time magazine's Man Of The Year . He won applause after he was photographed kissing the face and head of a man suffering from neurofibromatosis, a disease similar to that suffered by the 'elephant man' which causes growth to form all over his body. He also washed the feet of convicts in Rome, ate a meal with the city's homeless just before Christmas, and sent handwritten notes to Catholics all over the world asking for his help. He famously appeared in the first Papal 'selfie' photograph, won Esquire's Best Dressed award for 2013 and was named Time magazine's Man Of The Year.","Vatican confirms that Pope Francis doesn't believe sin 'abolished'

Margaret Thatcher’s government considered redrawing the Irish border to move thousands of Catholics into the Republic, but abandoned the idea on human rights grounds. The extraordinary plan to move part of Belfast from Northern Ireland to the Republic emerged in files from 1984 just released by the National Archive. The plan - which was studied by Mrs Thatcher personally – would have cut Northern Ireland in half and created a ‘walled ghetto’ in west Belfast. Division: The Thatcher government examined a proposal to cut Northern Ireland in half and hand part of it to the Republic, while creating a 'walled ghetto' in West Belfast (pictured) The idea was put forward by the Northern Ireland Office, based on a paper by Paul Compton, an academic from Queen's University Belfast. Unionists would have been compensated for giving up their homes and businesses to the Republic. But the Thatcher government concluded that while it might have been acceptable for a totalitarian regime, human rights arguments would be an obstacle, the Irish Independent reported. The fact that the idea reached the desk of the British prime minister reflects the desperation of the government to find a way to end the troubles. The newly-released files reveal details of several secret meetings between the UK and Irish governments. After the IRA bombed the Conservative party conference in Brighton in October 1984, Mrs Thatcher called for the talks to be slowed down to avoid the impression that she was ‘being bombed into making concession to the Republic’. Irish Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald was opposed the idea of partitioning part of Northern Ireland, because it would create a permanent division on the island, Margaret Thatcher said . The idea of redrawing the Irish border to move Catholics into the Republic was one of the most extreme to be considered by ministers. Incentives would be offered to ‘drive out large numbers’, officials from the Northern Ireland Office suggested. Mr Compton’s study was described as a ‘most respected analysis by the NIO. A copy of it was sent to Mrs Thatcher who added notes and heavily underlined the files. Dr Compton suggested three options for repartition. It included one which would have seen more than half of Northern Ireland to the Republic, cutting its population to one million, three-quarters of which would have been Protestant. Under a less extreme option parts of Fermanagh, south Armagh and most of Derry city would have been ceded, cutting the Catholic population by 105,000 to around 460,000. Around 30,000 Protestants would have been transferred to the Republic. Officials also discussed Dr Compton's idea of slicing up Belfast itself, creating ‘a wedge-shaped area in west Belfast’ running from Twinbrook to the Divis Flats, including areas such as Poleglass, Andersonstown and the Lower Falls. The briefing paper discussed ‘difficulties over the Belfast sector’. It warned that the idea of a ‘walled ghetto’ would involve ‘physical as well as political difficulties’. It adds: ‘Policing international boundaries across Belfast and any corridor between republican Belfast and the Border would be a formidable task.’","Idea was examined by officials who referred it to the Prime Minister .

A secret plan was hatched by the Thatcher government to stop union leaders smuggling suitcases of Soviet cash in Britain. Ministers believed hundreds of thousands of pounds were being channelled to the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) from Moscow in 1984. Newly-released documents from the National Archives reveal Margaret Thatcher was told by her closest aides how customs officials should be put on alert for large sums of money being brought into the UK. Funds: The Thatcher government was convinced that suitcases of money brought into Britain by mining union leaders came from the Soviet regime (file picture) The desperate plan to stem the flow of money to the unions came at a time when Mrs Thatcher considered mobilising hundreds of troops and declaring a state of emergency at the height of the 1984 miners’ strike. Another option was to switch to a three-day working week after ministers warned her that the lights could go out in Britain. The NUM’s assets had been sequestered by the courts after its president, Arthur Scargill, refused to allow it to pay a £200,000 fine for contempt. But officials told Mrs Thatcher there was little they could do to stop the flow of roubles to support the union’s battle with the government. The Conservative Prime Minister was told the best they could hope for was that a NUM courier might be picked up by Customs trying to enter the country with ‘a suitcase full of bank notes’. Minsters were alerted by MI5 to the Soviet financial lifeline for the miners in early November 1984. A few days later the Soviet news agency TASS reported publicly that £500,000 had been raised to support the strike. Support: The money was used to bankroll the miners' strike after the National Union of Miners' assets were frozen by the courts . Although the money was supposed to have been donated by Russian miners, the Government had little doubt that the funds could only have been transferred abroad with the approval of the Soviet authorities. Cabinet Secretary Sir Robert Armstrong was forced to admit to Mrs Thatcher that there was little the authorities in the UK could do, But despite the sequestration order. In a memo written on 5 November 1982, Sir Robert said:  ‘There are no powers which could be used to prevent the transfer of funds from abroad to the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) or to somebody nominated to receive them on behalf of the NUM in this country,’ he wrote in a memorandum dated November 5. ‘If a representative of the NUM could be detected entering this country with a suitcase full of bank notes, it might be possible to arrange for him to be stopped and searched by Customs. ‘They would have no power to impound the notes, but they would inform the Inland Revenue and the police of any suspiciously large volume of banknotes which they detected.’ Talks: Mrs Thatcher raised the issue of the money with Russian Mikhail Gorbachev in December 1984, but it was dismissed as a purely British problem . He added: ‘I am afraid this is not certain to yield results, but I am satisfied that it is the best we can do. I have made arrangements to give very quick consideration of possible courses of action, if those who are exercising vigilance get a break we can exploit.’ Ministers, however, did not want to give up. Henry Steel in the Attorney General's office wrote to the Foreign Office stating that the Government ‘now have an interest, going beyond their ordinary political interest, in the sequestrators laying their hands on NUM funds’. He went on: ‘If the FCO now have or acquire in the future any concrete information about the way in which the money in question is being transferred, it would therefore be very desirable that that information - not necessarily, of course, in its 'raw' form - should be passed onto the sequestrators.’ Meanwhile, Industry Minister Norman Lamont was instructed to raise the issue at a private lunch with the Soviet ambassador in London, but he got nowhere. Finally, it fell to Mrs Thatcher herself to tackle Mikhail Gorbachev - the rising star of the Kremlin - when he made his historic first visit to Britain in December 1984. Although after their meeting at Chequers, she famously declared that he was a man she could ‘do business with’, on this issue at least she made little headway. ‘Mr Gorbachev asked whether the Prime Minister really believed that Soviet Communists were so strong as to be to keep the British miners out on strike for over 10 months,’ the official minute noted. ‘The problem was purely a British one.’","Ministers wanted to stem flow of roubles to unions from Moscow .

Deborah Welsh, found her blue Toyota Yaris ablaze in the early hours of New Year's Day - and is now calling for the paper lights to be banned. Firefighters used hose reels to tackle the fire, which had started when the lantern set wiper blades and plastic trim alight, before flames spread to the engine bay. A passer-by saw the lantern land, and upon arrival firefighters confirmed that it had caused the fire. Dangerous: Ms Welsh is now calling for a ban of the paper lanterns after they set light to her blue Toyota Yaris . The whole bonnet and engine have completely melted away and the car has been left badly damaged. The fire service issued a warning about Chinese lanterns prior to the New Year celebrations, asking people to be aware of the risks. The 48 year-old from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, said: 'I thought Chinese lanterns were banned, and I think they definitely should be after this. Chinese lanterns have been responsible for other blazes . 'I've got enough problems without this as I am disabled. 'I'm devastated, as I have no way to get around or get my son to school.'

'They could start fires which would then go undetected until serious damage had been caused, particularly in rural areas. 'They can also cause environmental damage and for those reasons we would recommend they are not used.' This . incident happened during the final stages of the most recent strike by .

He added it was 'extremely lucky' that no one was killed. Damaged: The bumper and the front of the car has completely melted away . Labour West Bromwich MP Tom Watson said the lanterns were 'just not safe', and also called for a ban. In 2011, a Chinese lantern set light to a home as a family slept inside. Anne-Marie Cobb, 40, and her children Samuel, eight, and Amelia, six, were asleep when the blaze took hold at 11.15pm in Trowbridge, Wiltshire. The paper lantern landed on a partly-built extension to the rear of the property and set fire to the insulation in the roof. A timber frame for the extension then also caught fire - just 2ft from where Amelia was sleeping. Fortunately a neighbour spotted the flames, dialled 999 and helped evacuate the family. Another mother also called for a ban after her son was nearly blinded by one. Boiling wax fell from a Chinese lantern and landed on three-year-old Cael Jones’ face, almost blinding him.

Two friends who served together during the Second World War have been reunited 70 years later after a chance encounter revealed they were living just 12 miles from each other. Bessie Thomas and Millie Titshall were radar operators for the WAAF when they were both teenagers, and became close friends serving at a station in Inverness. However, they lost touch towards the end of the war - and although they tried to contact each other during the following decades, they never managed to get in touch. But when Mrs Thomas, 89, from Consett in . County Durham, was reading her local newspaper she noticed an appeal . for information about a former RAF base in Norfolk. Together again: Bessie Thomas, left, and Miggie Titshall, right, have been reunited after 70 years . Friends: The pair - then known as Bessie Shackley, left, and Mildred Greener, right - pictured during the war . Although she did not know that base, she made contact with the enthusiast who placed the advert on the off-chance that some of her former colleagues might have served there. She was particularly keen to find her old friend Mildred Greener - but when she was given a phone number for Millie Titshall, who she was told lived near her, she had no idea they were the same person. Mrs Thomas called the number and asked, 'Do you know of a Mildred Greener?' - only to be told, 'That's me!' The day of the pair's first conversation happened to be Mrs Titshall's 90th birthday, and came 70 years after they had last seen each other. The two women, then aged just 17 and 18, first met at RAF Snaith in Yorkshire after volunteering for the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. Coincidence: The woman realised that they lived just 12 miles apart in Co Durham thanks to a newspaper ad . They were transferred together to radar operations in Inverness, but lost contact when they moved to different parts of the country. The younger woman, then known as Bessie Shackley, met her future husband Larry Thomas while they were both being de-mobbed at the end of the war. Mildred Greener also changed her surname when she married, and started calling herself Millie because other relatives shared her first name. Mrs Thomas was so keen to trace her friend that she once called every number listed under 'Greener' in her local phonebook. When the pair - now both widowed - finally made contact again, Mrs Thomas was so excited she immediately travelled to Mrs Tindall's Chester-le-Street home via bus and taxi. Memories: The pair have enjoyed reminiscing about their wartime experiences with the WAAF . Her first sight of her old friend was of her waiting on the street outside her house. 'I think I could have walked past her on the street, but she's still lovely and thin,' Mrs Thomas said. Once the pair started talking about their time in the WAAF, they could not stop reminding each other of all their unusual experiences. Both vividly remembered typing out messages on rice paper, which would be given to pilots so they could recognise beacon signals and then eat their instructions if they were captured. Mrs Thomas said: 'Millie told me, ""I used to eat it!"" as we didn't get sweets very much - they were rationed - and I said, ""That's what I used to do!""' Hard at work: A group of other WAAF workers pictured during the war working at a radar station . They also recalled circling the perimeter of the airfield, attaching metallic strips to planes in order to interfere with enemy radar. 'Mildred would get taken around in a van as she was smaller than me and couldn't reach up - and I had to cycle,' Mrs Thomas said. Her daughter Marilyn, who was present during a second meeting between the pair, said they were soon laughing so much that they appeared to be shaking in photographs. The two old friends now intend to keep in regular contact - and Mrs Thomas is keen to get in touch with other former colleagues too.","Bessie Thomas, 89, and Millie Titshall, 90, served together as teenagers .

David Cameron was yesterday accused of planning to 'kow-tow'  to European human rights judges and scrap the country's toughest  jail sentences. So-called 'whole-life' terms, which condemn the most dangerous serial killers to die behind bars, could be replaced by 'US-style, 100-year terms'. But crucially, unlike many states in the US, the new sentences in Britain will come with an automatic review – potentially allowing murderers who would otherwise have stayed in jail to be released back on to the streets. The proposal has infuriated Tory backbenchers. Last night Peter Bone said: 'The trouble with 100-year sentences is they can be reviewed and reduced and people could be let out. For certain people, life should mean life – in prison for the rest of their lives.' Downing Street is set to change the law to comply with a European Court of Human Rights judgment, which found life sentences without any prospect of parole amounted to a breach of killers' human rights. In July, the court ruled all inmates, however long their sentences, should have a chance at proving they have changed their ways and are no longer a threat to the public. Without a review mechanism, such sentences amounted to 'inhuman and degrading treatment' and breached Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the judges said. When the ruling was released, Mr Cameron's spokesman said the Prime Minister 'profoundly disagreed' and was a 'strong supporter of whole-life tariffs'. But less than six months later he appears ready to bow to Strasbourg's demands. Yesterday Mr Cameron tried to appear tough on the issue. He told BBC News: 'What I think is very clear, there are some people who commit such dreadful crimes that they should be sent to prison and life should mean life. Whatever the European court has said, we must put in place arrangements to make sure that can continue.' But he failed to rule out changes to the 'whole-life' regime, which is reserved for killers and rapists deemed so depraved they can never be let out. In the US, many criminals are given lengthy sentences with no chance of release. Last year Ohio kidnapper and rapist Ariel Castro was sentenced to life imprisonment plus 1,000 years without parole. He was later found dead in his cell. Last night pressure was mounting on Mr Cameron. Mr Bone said: 'We should ignore the ruling of this Mickey Mouse court in Strasbourg and do what the British people want.' Prime Minister David Cameron has been accused of planning to 'kow-tow' to European human rights judges . Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: 'The abolition of whole-life sentences is a backward step. This proposal means that every murderer, no matter how grotesque their crimes, has an automatic right to parole hearings. What is the point of having elections if governments always end up kow-towing to the European Court of Human Rights?' The Strasbourg case was brought by three convicted killers given whole-life sentences who demanded the right to a parole hearing – Jeremy Bamber, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore. There 52 individuals serving such terms. The Strasbourg court said all must be allowed a review of their sentence, with release following if they can prove they have been successfully 'rehabilitated'. It suggested the whole-lifers should be given a review after 25 years inside and every few years afterwards. There is also pressure to amend the law from senior judges. In October, Mr Justice Sweeney said it was 'not appropriate' to give  triple killer Ian McLoughlin a whole-life sentence because of the Strasbourg decree. The same judge is due to sentence the Woolwich killers of Lee Rigby – Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale.","So-called 'whole-life' terms could be .

While most flower patches across the nation lie bare, Abbey Garden on the Isles of Scilly can boast of having 255 different species of flower in bloom. The New Year flower count, which was completed by Abbey Garden’s head gardener, Andrew Lawson, curator Mike Nelhams and garden students, is an annual island tradition that has been taking place for more than 150 years. Winter wonderland: This year the count found that the garden was home to 255 different species of plant . Vibrant: Even in January, tropical flowers bloom in the garden, which is just 30 miles from the Cornish mainland . Counting up: Garden student Hugh Fletcher (left), head gardener Andrew Lawson (centre) and curator Mike Nelhams (right) tally up the plants . Professional garden curators and local people have been called upon to count the number of flowering species and keep track of the diverse plant-life. The spectacular display of greenery is made possible by the balmy climate of the island of Tresco, just 30 miles from the Cornish coast, and the sheltered design of the gardens themselves. Built alongside the stately St Nicholas’ Priory, once the home of a 19th Century landowner, the gardens are protected by high walls and rows of thick trees and shrubs, which protect the delicate species inside from any rough winds. The gardens are also south-facing, which, combined the Scilly Isles’ unusually high, means that plants from as far afield as South Africa do not struggle to grow.

Far-flung: Mr Fletcher and Mr Nelhams admire an Agave Americana tree, from Mexico . Hotter, drier terraces at the top of the garden suit South African and Australian plants, while those lower down provide the humidity that favours flora from New Zealand and South America. When the winter blooms come, the garden’s exotic aloes, acacias and proteas take centre stage. Although the gardens have been decimated in previous years by extremely bad weather – such as the Great Storm of 1987 – they are growing once again and this year 25 more species have been found than in the 2013 count.","Abbey Garden on the Isle of Scilly has 255 species in bloom even in January .

Almost 160,000 patients a year suffer from sores, infections and injuries caused by neglectful NHS care, figures show. The health problems are being picked up on hospital wards and in care homes. The figure represents one in 12 – 8 per cent – of all those treated on the NHS,  but among the elderly it is nearer to one in ten. Almost 160,000 patients a year suffer from sores, infections and injuries caused by neglectful NHS care, figures show . Campaigners say it is ‘scandalous’ that hospitals are making patients even more unwell due to failings in basic care. For the first time, the NHS has released data on the numbers of patients suffering any of four conditions linked to neglect. They are falls, pressure sores, bladder infections and deep vein thrombosis – or blood clots – which can be avoided through good nursing care. Between May 2012 and April 2013, a total of 159,946 patients suffered one of these. Last month alone there were 15,000 cases including 13,100 pressure sores, 2,470 serious falls, 2,850 urinary infections and 1,139 blood clots. Some patients suffered more than one of the health problems. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘It is truly scandalous that patients are admitted to hospital for treatment for one condition, and then have to endure a second totally preventable issue. ‘This care deficit is leading to basic, but often serious and hugely painful, conditions. There is no excuse for poor care. Trusts have a duty to drive down the huge numbers of these terrible experiences and be accountable where they are falling short.’ Peter Walsh, chief executive of the charity Action Against Medical Accidents, said that in reality about one in ten patients come to harm once other hospital blunders are included. ‘It’s not a surprise to me but it’s disappointing,’ he added. Hospital care and the standard of nursing has been in the spotlight since a damning report into the Mid Staffordshire scandal, where up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly over a ten-year period . For the past 12 months NHS hospitals, care homes and community health services have submitted data on patients suffering falls, bed sores, blood clots or urinary infections. They were asked to record the percentage suffering one or more of these problems on a given day each month. Officials will use this data – the NHS Safety Thermometer – to monitor whether hospitals and other organisations are reducing the numbers of patients coming to harm. Hospital care and particularly the standard of nursing has been in the spotlight since a damning report in February into the Mid Staffordshire scandal. Up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly at the NHS trust over a ten-year period with some left crying in pain or forced to drink water from vases. The report warned that similar pockets of neglect existed at other hospitals and the Government announced a number of changes to improve care. They include compulsory placements for student nurses to prove they are capable of compassion and tougher inspections of hospitals and care homes. Doctors have warned that seriously-ill patients are being shunted out of A&E and left on inappropriate wards where they are not properly looked after. The Royal College of Physicians said a rise in admissions to hospital emergency units meant there was extra pressure on staff to move patients out quickly. For example, elderly people with pneumonia are being put on surgical wards – where many patients are young and otherwise fit – which tend to have fewer nurses.","Health problems are being picked up on hospital wards and in care homes .

Alastair Cook, whose captaincy during England’s surrender of the Ashes has attracted considerable criticism, has had a lot on his mind on and off the pitch. As well as England facing a series whitewash in Sydney, Cook is also expecting his first child with wife Alice and trying to buy a house, both of which can be stressful distractions. While in Australia, Cook is understood to have been negotiating to buy a farm for around £1.2million. Feeling the strain: Alastair Cook has had a stressful Ashes tour both on and off the field . The residential 52-acre farm with extensive equestrian facilities, including 10 stables, is situated near Alice’s family farm in Bedfordshire, where Cook loves to spend time helping with the lambing and having a beer with the locals to escape from the pressures of Test cricket. There is planning permission in place for Cook to knock down the farm buildings, allowing for the construction of a country mansion with panoramic views over open rolling countryside. Jonny Bairstow being given a second match as wicketkeeper was confirmed by captain Alastair Cook the day before the Test. Yet Australia skipper Michael Clarke, who declined to list the England side in advance as he did earlier in the series, did keep up the mind games by suggesting, at two pre-Test press conferences, that he believes axed wicketkeeper Matt Prior was especially missed by England in Melbourne and should have been back in the side for Sydney. Dropped: Vice-captain Matt Prior had been a mainstay of the England side since 2009 . Colin Graves, Yorkshire chairman and deputy chairman of the ECB, and his family have more reason than most on the England tour in Australia for wanting to put 2013 behind them. Three masked men, armed with a sledge-hammer, sword and handgun, smashed their way into the supermarket tycoon’s country home and stole £220,000 worth of jewellery. Graves, who founded the Costcutter chain, was away on Yorkshire’s pre-season tour of Barbados last March when the raid took place. His wife Sharon was forced at gunpoint to lie on the landing while the gang opened the safe. Year to forget: Yorkshire chairman Colin Graves' house was targeted by armed robbers . She was described as ‘a woman of commendable steel’ at Maidstone Crown Court where the four robbers, including a getaway driver, were recently given jail sentences of between four and 10 years. Graves, in Sydney with his wife and daughter Francesca, who was also threatened during the armed robbery, said: ‘We were always coming to Australia as we did for the series three years ago. But it’s a chance to let us move on from a difficult time.’ Relationships between the two warring Ashes teams at Australian prime minister Tony Abbott’s reception improved to the extent that a wife of one of the England Cricket Board directors even queued up to have her picture taken with Aussie destroyer-in-chief Mitchell Johnson. However, the ECB remain furious with the way their counterparts Cricket Australia continue to use social media in an aggressive manner — and the subject will be raised after the fifth Test. Mr Popular: Australia fast bowler Mitchell Johnson is odds-on to win man of the series . Piers’ charm offensive . Piers Morgan, who hijacked attention from the Ashes with his ludicrous MCG nets encounter with Brett Lee that resulted in a broken rib, continues on his self-publicity cricket tour Down Under by tweeting about his first meeting with the equally obnoxious Ian Chappell: “Hi, Mr Chappell, I’m Piers Morgan”, I said. “Nah mate, you’re a d*******,' he replied.’ But when it comes to d*******s, Chappell wins by a short head.

A record-breaking two out of three women tried to lose weight in the past year – and more men than ever are trying to slim down, figures have shown. This means that last year a total of 29million Britons decided to exercise or diet to ward off problems associated with weight gain. The proportion of women who tried to shed some weight went up last year from 63 per cent to an all-time high of 65 per cent. More than half (55 per cent) of Brits having tried to lose weight in the past year . And the percentage of men who . attempted to cut down the size of their paunch rose from 42 to 44 per . cent in 2013, according to an annual survey by retail analyst Mintel. The . figures come after Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence spoke out . against the pressure on women to look thin, calling on Hollywood to drop . its obsession with unrealistically skinny body images. Official . statistics show 61 per cent of the UK population are still overweight. Of these, more than 13million are clinically obese – with the cost of . NHS treatment for associated health problems such as heart disease and . diabetes running to billions of pounds every year. Encouragingly, . the survey showed that exercise seemed to be more popular with slimmers . than faddy diets, with around 60 per cent of people choosing to get a . bit more active when they wanted to manage their weight. The 5:2 diet is now the nation's favourite, followed by Atkins and Dukan . However many of . the 29million who tried to lose weight last year used a combination of . exercise and healthy eating. Just under half said they tried to cut back . on fatty foods and 48 per cent limited themselves to smaller portions . and consumed less sugar. In . 2013, 2.32million took up fashionable diet crazes – with around a . million trying the 5:2 regime, which involves reducing calorie intake on . two days a week. The . programme’s part-time approach led to it coming out on top of the list . of the year’s popular diets. The regime is particularly effective at . reducing belly fat and lowering the cholesterol levels associated with . blocked arteries. Coming in . second place was the low carbohydrate Atkins diet – and 25 per cent of . dieters opted for high protein and low fat weight loss regimes such as . the Dukan diet. But while . millions see the New Year as a good time to try and get healthy, with a . host of celebrity weight loss DVDs cashing in on the trend, the figures . revealed that many slimmers’ efforts are doomed to failure. Mintel found . that out of everyone who tried dieting last year, one in five said . their good intentions had soon fallen by the wayside thanks to a lack of . willpower. More than a . third found it hard to count calories when dining out and around one in . ten said their lives were so busy that it was too hard to stick to a . diet. Despite struggling to . eat healthily, many people said they still viewed food aimed . specifically at dieters with suspicion. Diet food sales dipped by 1 per . cent in 2012 and then went on to increase by a marginal 2 per cent in . 2013. The survey found most people didn’t trust the products’ ingredients, such as artificial sweeteners. They . also tended to resent the small portion sizes and questioned whether . any of the meals were actually lower in calories than standard products. Mintel’s . senior food analyst Emma Clifford said: ‘Sales of diet meals are . struggling, which is at odds with the huge consumer interest in losing . weight, framed by rising levels of obesity. ‘There . is a myriad of other routes towards weight loss that consumers prefer . over buying “light” or “diet” food, with exercising more being the most . popular.

But does the sea hold the secret to truly great vintages? To find out a trio of French wine lovers - a vineyard manager, a barrel maker and an oyster farmer - teamed up to test the myth, above and below water. Barrels of a 2009 Bordeaux wine were stored in two locations - one was to be kept in chateau cellars, the other sunk among the prized oyster beds of the Bay of Arcachon, on the Atlantic coast. The sea is the key: Oyster farmer Joel Dupuch (left) and winemaker Bruno Lemoine recover a wine barrel buried on the shore of the French Atlantic for six months . They were tested after six months and the one stored below the sea was indeed found to be the best tasting. Lab analysis also showed extraordinary results – showing the special combination of being submerged had changed the water-bound one by osmosis. ‘I had heard a bunch of stories about wines ageing at sea,’ said Bruno Lemoine, who runs the cellars of Chateau Larrivet Haut-Brion in the southwest Bordeaux region. Finished product: The 'Neptune' branded wine from Chateau Larrivet Haut-Brion which was aged under the sea . ‘I found the whole idea amusing and intriguing. So when in 2009 we found ourselves with an exceptional vintage, full of rich tannins, I decided to put it to good use. ‘It started out as a lark among friends. One of us came up with the idea and the others ran with it.’ First Lemoine, who unveiled their findings this week in Paris,  asked his barrel-maker friend Pierre-Guillaume Chiberry to build him two small 56-litre wooden barrels in which to age his red wine by an extra six months. Chiberry set his three top craftsmen to work on the barrels, assembling them simultaneously by hand to ensure they were strictly identical for the purpose of the experiment. When done - inspired by the challenge - they cycled 93 miles to Lemoine's vineyard in June 2011 with the barrels in tow to see them poured full of the 2009 vintage, already aged nearly two years by this point. 'It was much better than it should have been' The barrel kept at the chateau was dubbed ‘Tellus’ after the Roman goddess of the land, and the other ‘Neptune’ after the sea god. Neptune was picked up by Lemoine's oyster farmer friend Joel Dupuch and rowed out to the low tide mark, where it was chained inside a concrete chamber that kept it protected while letting the water flow in and out. ‘The barrel could roll around a little,’ as it would if it were lying on the sea bed, Dupuch told the wine lovers and journalists gathered in Paris. ‘It was very exposed to the wind and the weather, and it was just opposite the window of my house, so I could keep an eye on it!’ Traditional storage: The other barrel of the same batch of wine was aged for six months in a chateau cellar . During the very lowest tides it was briefly exposed to the air, around 25 or 30 times over a six-month period. Both barrels were retrieved in January for the wine to be bottled, tasted and analysed in a laboratory. Tellus turned out to be rather disappointing. But Neptune was a good surprise all round. ‘When we tasted it, it was much better than it should have been,’ the expert taster Bernard Burtschy told the Paris gathering. Lab tests helped shed some light on the process: despite the barrel's watertight stainless steel plug, they confirmed that the wine was subtly changed by its ocean environment through a process of osmosis. On the one hand the wine lost some of its alcohol content, while on the other it saw its sodium concentration rise, adding a subtly salty note that brings out the best of the tannins, Burtschy said. ‘In ancient times the Romans used to add a little salt water to their wine,’ he pointed out. For Lemoine, Neptune has yet to tell its full story. Fine find: Eleven bottles of champagne found in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea in 2010 sold for £90,000 last week . A lot of bottle: Diving instructor Christian Ekstrom holds one of the 200-year-old bottles he found . ‘We've tasted it at a particular point in time,’ he said. ""But you need to see how the wine evolves over a longer period.’ He intends to keep checking the vintage over the coming decade - and already plans new experiments, with different wine-making processes and barrel sizes, to tease out more wine-making secrets from the sea. One of the earliest known sea vintages dates from the 18th century, when the Bordeaux baron Louis-Gaspard d'Estournel sent a shipment of wine to India, whose unsold bottles returned to France mysteriously improved by the hull journey. The most recent - and extreme - case dates from Friday, when 11 bottles of the world's oldest champagne, salvaged in 2010 from a Baltic Sea shipwreck, were auctioned off in Finland for £90,000 ($136,000). The six bottles of Juglar, four of Veuve Clicquot and one of Heidsieck & Co, were preserved or even improved in the 200 years since the wreck, experts believe, thanks to the ideal conditions found on the chilled, lightless bed of the Baltic.","French trio aged two barrels of identical wine for six months - one under sea and the other in chateau cellar .

It is a post-Cold War collaboration between the US and Russia, which has provided heat to millions of homes across America. But the little-known Megatons-to-Megawatts programme, which has seen 20,000 decommissioned Russian nuclear warheads transformed into nuclear energy in the US, has drawn to a close this month. The final shipment of low enriched uranium (LEU) was unloaded at the Port of Baltimore in Maryland on December 10 after a four-week journey by sea from St Petersburg. Scroll down for video . The little-known Megatons-to-Megawatts programme, has seen 20,000 decommissioned Russian nuclear warheads transformed into nuclear energy in the US, heating millions of homes . It was the last of the LEU converted from more than 500 tonnes of highly enriched uranium from the Russian warheads, deactivated under the 1991 START treaty at the end of the Cold War. The recycling and transfer of the uranium to the US was formalised in a 1993 agreement and has seen hundreds of shipments arrive in the US destined for the country's nuclear reactors. The programme has supplied nearly 10 per cent of all American electricity and around one in 10 light bulbs powered via the scheme in the last two decades. The shipment marks the end of the unprecedented programme, which has seen the US pay its former enemy $8billion (Â£5bn) in the last 20 years. The programme has supplied nearly 10 per cent of all American electricity and around one in 10 light bulbs have been powered via the scheme in the last two decades . The shipments are transported from St Petersburg to America by sea, before they are taken to the USEC Paducah plant to be converted into uranium pellets used to fuel nuclear reactors across America . The four cylinders of LEU was taken from . Baltimore to the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky, where it . will be turned into uranium oxide pellets destined for nuclear power . plants across the country. Towards . the end of the Cold War, Philip Sewell, a former deputy assistant . secretary at the US Department of Energy, was given the task of seeking . ways to collaborate with past enemies. His quest saw him travel through the Russian countryside, to military facilities, many of which were not on the map. Describing a typical scene, Mr Sewell said: 'Windows were broken, gates were not locked, and there were very few people around.' But . it was inside the crumbling, dilapidated buildings that the Russian . government stored the uranium from thousands of decommissioned nuclear . weapons. Concerned that the . material could so easily fall into the wrong hands, Mr Sewell and his . colleagues decided the situation was so dangerous that they needed to . negotiate with the Russians to persuade them to sell the surplus to the . US. Initially, the Russians refused. 'It . was a matter of pride, principle and patriotism,' said Mr Sewell. 'Even . though they didn't need that excess material, [and] they didn't have . the money to protect it, they didn't want to let go of it.' But the Russian nuclear industry needed funding and so the government yielded and a deal was struck in 1993. The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC), is the US government agent responsible for implementing the historic agreement. Before . the uranium was shipped to the US, the bomb-grade highly enriched . uranium was converted and diluted into low enriched uranium. 'The Megatons to Megawatts Program made a . substantial contribution both to the elimination of nuclear weapons . material and to nuclear energy generation in the United States,' said US . Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. 'Nearly every commercial nuclear reactor in the United States received nuclear fuel under the programme. 'This Agreement serves as an example of what the United States and Russia can achieve when we work together, and we are carrying this success forward into other nonproliferation activities with each other and with our international partners. 'For two decades, one in ten light bulbs in America has been powered by nuclear material from Russian nuclear warheads.' 'The 1993 United States-Russian Federation Highly Enriched Uranium Purchase Agreement has proven to be one of the most successful nuclear nonproliferation partnerships ever undertaken,' Secretary Moniz added. 'The completion of this ""swords to ploughshares"" program represents a major victory both for the United States and Russia.' National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden, said in a statement: 'The United States and Russia are commemorating the completion of one of the most successful non-proliferation programs in our history. 'The United States and Russia remain strongly committed to building on this success, and will continue to collaborate across various fields of nonproliferation, nuclear security and nuclear research and development.' The initiative has come to an end after Russia claimed the US was not paying enough for the uranium - which is roughly the equivalent value to 10 billion barrels of crude oil. While the Megatons-to-Megawatts programme has ended, Russia will continue to supply uranium to the US. A new 10-year programme is expected to supply around half the level of the previous scheme by 2015, with the option to increase it to the same level as the Megatons-to-Megawatts programme if both sides agree. The difference is that, under the new contract, the supply will no longer come from decommissioned warheads, but from Russia's commercial activities. The programme came to an end this month as the last shipment reached the US . The process began with the removal of the warheads and their highly enriched uranium metal components. At . plants in Seversk and Ozersk the components are ground down into metal . shavings, which are then heated and converted into a highly enriched . uranium oxide. That was . then heated to make a gas, which was mixed with a very low enriched . uranium material before it was diluted to less than five per cent . concentration the fissionable uranium-235 isotope, a level too low to be . of any military value but ideal for producing electric power. The . material is then transferred to 2.5-tonne steel cylinders, enclosed in . protective shipping containers and sent to a storage facility in St . Petersburg. After . completing its journey to America, the shipment is then taken to the . United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) plant in Paducah, where it . is tested to ensure it meets the appropriate specifications. It . is then converted into uranium oxide pellets and fabricated into fuel . assemblies. delivered to plants across the US to be used in their . nuclear reactors to create energy.","In the last two decades 10 per cent of US electricity was fueled by the decommissioned Russian warheads .

Searchers have discovered a body in a Texas creek that is thought to be a 26-year-old mother of four who disappeared the day after Christmas. Melissa Sowders' family fears she was killed after she went meet up with her estranged husband Matt Sowders to visit her 18-month-old daughter on December 26. Authorities found a body in Cypress Creek in Harris County, Texas, Thursday afternoon that they believe is Mrs Sowders - though an autopsy will be needed to confirm it is her. Mr Sowders denies he was involved in his wife's disappearance. He has hired a lawyer and police say he is not cooperating with the investigation. Scroll down for video . Fears: Melissa Sowders, 26, has been missing since last Thursday. The pregnant mother-of-four was going to meet her estranged husband when she vanished and her abandoned car was found the next day . Melissa Sowders can be seen rubbing her pregnant belly in this surveillance footage of her the day before she vanished . The video is from a Christmas Day visit Sowders made to her boyfriend's godparents' home. She disappeared the next day . 'As far as we know he has threatened her numerous times. He has had a knife to her throat before,' Melissa's cousin Michelle Bierman told ABC News. 'We think he just went off the edge when he found out she was two months pregnant with Jason's child.' The godparents of Miss Sowders's boyfriend released surveillance video of her Christmas Day visit to their small business - just hours before she went missing. She can be seen on camera gently rubbing her pregnant belly. Miss Sowders vanished after meeting . her estranged husband to visit her youngest child, according to her new . boyfriend, Jason Sanford. Mr Sanford, says she was terrified of her ex - . with whom she has four children. Police have interviewed Miss Sowder's husband, but have not named him as a suspect. Crickitt Kreger, Mr Sanford's godmother, told KHOU-TV she was one of the last people to see Miss Sowder alive. She and Mr Sanford visited Mrs Kreger and her husband for Christmas. 'I did tell her Christmas Day, you're working your way into my heart,' Ms Kreger told the TV station. Miss Sowder's family say they fear she is already dead, that she drowned in Cypress Creek. 'The water is cold, she's in there. It's not a proper place,' Michelle Bierman, Miss Sowder's cousin, told KHOU. Deputies suspect foul play. Sowders' boyfriend, Jason Sanford, told police he last saw her when she took him to work at 6.15am on Thursday in her white Honda Accord. He told deputies that she was supposed to meet her ex-husband and their youngest daughter at a McDonald's - and her family said they fear he could be involved in her disappearance. 'She was terrified of him. Terrified,' Michelle Bierman, Sowders' cousin, told KHOU11 on Monday. Relatives told the news channel that her estranged husband was abusive towards her and did not like her having a new boyfriend or having a child by him. Search: Deputies with the Harris County Sheriff Department had searched a wooded area along Cypress Creek on Saturday. They were then searching the water for any signs of the woman's body . Hunt: Volunteers used sonar equipment to search for the missing mother in the creek . Where's Melissa? They show the reading that has sparked their interest - before her body was found . 'Pretty much from the first day that we knew she was missing, and the circumstances of how she went missing. We knew. We knew,' Bierman added. Concerns: Her family says she was terrified of her ex - but police have not named him a suspect . Court records show that the ex-husband, who has custody of their children, actually filed for divorce in October. Authorities have interviewed the man but have not named him as a suspect. Volunteers from Texas Equusearch are using boats with sonar equipment at Cypress Creek and said they have already found readings of interest in 12 feet of water. 'We don’t want to leave this water until we know that we’ve absolutely cleared everything,' Tom Miller from Texas Equusearch said. 'I mean, there’s a lot of debris in there. There’s a lot of loose rocks in there. There's a lot of stuff and there's times we get false images but I really want to take a lot closer look at it.' But he said he was hopeful that Sowders was going to be found. 'I’m very optimistic she’s going to be found,' he said. 'I would hope it's gonna be today. If it’s not…I’m optimistic she’s gonna be found.' Hopeful: Volunteers with Texas Equusearch, seen Saturday, said they were hopeful she would be found alive . But her family is less positive about her returning to them alive. 'At this point, it’s been too long,' Bierman said. 'It's been too long. The reality is she's not gonna come back alive.'

More than a dozen police vehicles descended on the quiet neighborhood, a witness told NBC 2.Deputies could be seen bringing out large boxes most of the day. ‘It was crazy. There had to be like 15 cop cars,’ the witness said, ‘And they were bringing out box after box of something.’ Another neighbor described the scene to Fox 4. ‘I came home at about 6 p.m. and there were still about 10 cop cars and they had this big bread truck and they were bringing boxes and boxes of something out,’ said Peter Ryther. Swarmed: More than a dozen police vehicles descended on the San Carlos Park home . Shock and awe: Neighbors were floored by the sheer number of police raiding the home, and surprised it happened in their nieghborhood . Neighbors told Fox 4 that Carroll had only been living in the house for six months, that he mostly kept to himself and never had problems with anyone. ‘I have never had any problems with the neighborhood. It's a family neighborhood, a nice neighborhood, so this was a big surprise,’ Mr Ryther added. Mr Carroll was hit with multiple felonies including possession of synthetic narcotics and possession of a controlled substance without a prescription, records showed. He was also given a misdemeanor charge of keeping a shop of vehicle for drugs, as well as for violating probation. Quiet area: The neighborhood is normally quiet, and Mr Carroll had mostly kept to himself . The New Year’s Eve raid came as a surprise to most. ‘I was just shocked, especially here,’ Ruthanne Coyne told NBC 2. ‘This is such a good neighborhood.’ We just saw lots of cop cars and lots of undercover cops throughout the neighborhood,’ Jim Mielke told Fox 4.

John Eastman’s charges, reports the Waterbury Republican-American, include first-degree possession of child pornography, employing a minor in an obscene performance, and using a computer to entice a minor. Eastman’s computer contained more than 500 images of child pornography, including some webcam images of children believed to be as young as 5, according to the arrest warrant. False idol: John Eastman, right, fooled young girls online, some as young as 5, into performing sex acts for him via webcam by pretending to be One Direction boy bander Harry Styles, left . Police said a search of Eastman’s computer also turned up video footage of several singers, including Styles and Justin Bieber. According to an arrest warrant, Eastman used the screen name Harry.Styles888 on Skype and had pictures of the One Direction singer on his computer, which were used to convince children he was the 19-year-old Styles. 'My hope is that the girl will show me herself on camera and then pose in a sexual manner, or perform some kind of sex act for me to see,' Eastman told detectives, according to his arrest warrant. Eastman would sometimes offer concert tickets in exchange for children posing naked or performing sex acts online, authorities said. Over exposed: Eastman told police he took advantage of the band's popularity with the hope 'that the girl will show me herself on camera and then pose in a sexual manner' Police said they began investigating Eastman after being contacted by a Vermont state trooper, who had been looking into a complaint from a family about a conversation between three girls and a Skype-user posing as Styles.

It wasunclear if he had an attorney. Eastman has a criminal history that includes a conviction for fourth-degree sexual assault. He spent 10 years on the state’s sex offender registry before being taken off of that list in 2009. And this isn't the first time a grown man has posed as a One Directioner to fool young girls into performing for webcams. in 2012, a man named Simon Hale was convicted of befriending underage girls and tricking them into performing sexual acts on their webcams by posing as Justin Bieber and One Direction's Niall Horan. Hale persuaded the girls from Britain, Australia and Denmark into posing naked or topless for him as well as blackmailed the teenaged Bieber and 1D fans into performing sexual acts on Skype. The 37-year-old was jailed for a minimum of ten years and the judge branded him so dangerous he may never be freed. How common is it?

The families of British soldiers killed in battle have won a landmark legal victory that gives them the right to sue the Ministry of Defence. The Supreme Court ruled that relatives of four servicemen who died in Iraq could seek compensation for negligence and breach of human rights. The UK's highest court said the Government owed a duty of care to properly equip and train troops sent to war, but Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he was 'concerned' that it could make it 'more difficult for troops to carry out operations'.

Danger: Relatives say the Snatch Land Rovers the soldiers were travelling in were unprotected (file image) Private Phillip Hewett was killed by a roadside bomb while out on patrol in Al Amarah, Iraq . Tragedy: Lance Corporal Kirk Redpath (left) died in Iraq in 2007 and Corporal Stephen Allbutt's death in a friendly-fire incident in 2003 was condemned by a coroner as a 'completely avoidable tragedy' Yesterday, the families were . celebrating the ruling after an arduous fight for justice that has taken . ten years and their lawyers said the decision meant the MoD could no . longer be 'given carte blanche to fail to equip our troops'. Three of the men were killed when . their controversial Snatch Land Rovers were blown up by roadside bombs. The poorly protected vehicles – nicknamed 'mobile coffins' because of . their vulnerability to blasts – were finally replaced in 2008. Private Phillip Hewett, 21, of . Tamworth, Staffordshire, died when his Snatch struck an improvised . explosive device in July 2005; Private Lee Ellis, 23, of Wythenshaw, . Greater Manchester, was killed in February 2006; and Lance Corporal Kirk . Redpath, 22, of Romford, Essex, died in August 2007. Their families . argued that the MoD was culpable because it failed to provide adequately . protected vehicles and knew the Land Rovers were vulnerable to blasts. Eight years ago, Private Phillip Hewett died on a dusty battlefield in Iraq. The 1st Battalion Staffordshire Regiment soldier was killed when the Snatch Land Rover he was in struck a bomb near the town of al-Amarah on July 16, 2005. He was 21. Since then, his mother Sue Smith has fought her own battle – with the Ministry of Defence. She argued that the Government breached his human rights by negligently failing to provide adequately armoured vehicles. MoD chiefs insisted that they could not be held liable because the troops died on the battlefield and not on a British army base or in the UK. She took her fight to the High Court and the Appeal Court without success but finally triumphed yesterday. Mrs Smith, 51, of Tamworth, Staffordshire, said: 'It has been like headbutting a wall. The MoD has argued and covered up every step of the way.' She said she fought to prevent other families suffering a loss of a son in the way she did. 'Phillip is dead,' she said. 'Nothing is going to bring him back. But this might save other boys' lives in the future.' The 'Snatch', originally used to grab . rioters in Northern Ireland, weighs 3.5tons and has a 3.5-litre V8 . engine. Costing £60,000, it has become notorious for its lack of . protection against roadside bombs and 37 UK personnel have been killed . in them. The MoD said the Human Rights Act did not apply because the soldiers died in Iraq and not on a British Army base or in the UK. The court also upheld a ruling . allowing the families of three other soldiers to sue the MoD for . negligence over a 'friendly fire' incident in which a Challenger tank . fired at another when an officer became 'disorientated'. Corporal Stephen Allbutt, 35, of Sneyd . Green, Stoke-on-Trent, was killed in the incident in March 2003. Lance . Corporal Daniel Twiddy, of Stamford, Lincolnshire, and Trooper Andrew . Julien, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, were badly injured. Their families argued that the MoD was negligent for failing to properly equip the tanks and give soldiers adequate training. MoD lawyers argued that the nature of the battlefield meant it was incompatible with the idea of a 'right to life'. The rulings leave the MoD facing a multi-million pound bill for damages. The cases could take two years to . reach court and the Supreme Court justices warned the families they . would have to prove a case for compensation. Trooper David Clarke (left) died when his Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank was fired on by comrades in another British tank and Private Lee Ellis of the Parachute Regiment was killed by a roadside bomb . Lord Hope, Deputy President of the . Supreme Court, added: 'It is of paramount importance that the work the . Armed Forces do in the national interest should not be impeded by having . to prepare for or conduct active operations against an enemy under the . threat of litigation if things go wrong.' But Private Hewett's mother Susan . Smith, 51, said of the judgment: 'It is brilliant. The MoD can no longer . treat soldiers as sub-humans with no rights.' Lance Corporal Redpath's father Colin, . 57, said: 'The MoD has now got a duty of care to supply our brave . troops with the right equipment in a combat zone. In the past, the MoD . could have given them a broomstick and that would have been okay.' Corporal Allbutt's widow Debi, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'What we have achieved has changed history.'

Griefstricken Eric Clifton, 78, is almost £700 out of pocket after cancelling the event because his beloved wife Joyce, 72, died from cancer. The couple had forked out £160 for an initial deposit and a further £535 towards the bash to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary with 45 friends.

Tragically Mrs Clifton, a retired school teacher, passed away eight weeks before the big day following chemotherapy for bone and breast cancer. Army veteran Mr Clifton, from Swanmore in Hampshire, was shocked when staff at Lysses House, Fareham, told him the entire sum was non-returnable. Mr Clifton said: 'After Joyce died we phoned Lysses to let them know and they said 'That’s a deposit, that’s non-returnable, we did tell you that'.'

Charges: James Holmes is accused of shooting dead 12 people at Colorado cinema during a midnight showing of the new Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises . The man accused of shooting dead 12 people during a screening of the latest Batman movie said he was programmed to commit the gun rampage by an 'evil therapist,' a former prison inmate has claimed. James Holmes, 24, has been charged with carrying out the killings - and injuring at least 58 others - on July 20, when he allegedly opened fire at a cinema in Aurora, Colorado, that was showing The Dark Knight Rises. Steven Unruh who claims to have been a fellow inmate at the detention centre where Holmes is being held said he told him that he was 'programmed' to carry out the massacre during psychotherapy he had been receiving. Thirty eight-year-old Mr Unruh said he was in the booking area of the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office Detention Facility in Colorado when Holmes was first brought in. He said he communicated with Holmes from a nearby cell and that he told him that 'he felt like he was in a video game' during the shooting and that 'he wasn’t on his meds' and 'nobody would help him,' reports Infowars.com - the website of the Alex Jones radio show. He said Holmes also mentioned neuro-linguistic programming, a form of psychotherapy — and that he had been 'programmed' to kill by an evil therapist,' according to the website. Mr Unruh also claims he was given a phone number that Holmes asked him to call which connected to a bereavement counsellor. She reportedly has no acquaintance with Holmes or Mr Unruh. Mr Unruh, who made the allegations in an exclusive interview with the Denver Westword news website, said he had a four-hour talk with Holmes and claims he even persuaded him not to commit suicide. Holmes, a neuroscience student, is believed to have been fascinated with mind control. Earlier this month a judge set a court date for a preliminary hearing for the first week of January 2013.

The family of brain dead Jahi McMath is receiving financial help from the Terri Schiavo foundation . The parents of Jahi McMath are receiving financial backing from a foundation started by another family famous for their battle to keep their child on life support. The Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network has been working with relatives of the 13-year-old California girl, who was declared brain-dead after tonsil surgery, to get her moved to a care facility. Jahi McMath suffered complications after having her tonsils removed, causing her heart to stop and massive brain damage that the hospital say is so severe that she is effectively dead. The case of Terri Schiavo became famous in the late 1990s and early 2000s when her husband attempted to remove her feeding tube against the wishes of her parents. Terri Schiavo had suffered a heart attack in 1990 after which her husband cared for her, until 1998 when he filed a petition to have her feeding tube removed. Michael Schiavo claimed that it was his wife's wish to 'pull the plug', and after several years fighting her family in court, Terri's feeding tube was removed in 2005. Terri Schiavo's parents set up the foundation in 2001 to fight for Terri's case and now the organisation is devoted to helping families of incapacitated patients facing a loss of life support. Jahi underwent a tonsillectomy at Children's Hospital Oakland last month to treat sleep apnea. Her mother Nailah Winkfield, believes her daughter can recover and is fighting plans to turn off her ventilator, . On New Years Eve, the family won a last-minute injunction to keep Jahi alive until January 7. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, she said watching her daughter suffering will haunt her forever. 'My daughter started to bleed and that will scar me forever because it happened in front of my face, in front of my mother’s face, in front of my husband’s face,' she said on a break in the grounds of Children’s Hospital, Oakland, California. 'She was very scared. She knew something was wrong. To see your daughter like that is just heartbreaking. 'But I still have hope. In fact I have . more than hope. I am positive my daughter is going to wake up. I don’t . have a doubt. I talk to her about it all the time.' Grief: Marvin and Nailah Winkfield react as they speak to the Mail Online outside of Children's Hospital in Oakland  on January 1, 2014 . Tragic: This is Jahi McMath's eight grade photograph (left) and another school photograph is seen (right) - the happy teen suffered brain damage after complications from routine surgery to remove her tonsils in early December . Mrs Winkworth, 34, a Home Depot worker, was comforted by her husband Marvin, 33, a truck driver, as she sat on the wall outside the hospital which she has not left since December 9th when the complications occurred. 'I never knew I would have to fight a hospital to treat my daughter,' she said. 'I find it unbelievable.  I have not been home since December 9th, I have been sleeping in the waiting room. I cannot leave Jahi.' She said that the way the hospital has treated her daughter and the family has been 'disgusting'. 'The way the hospital has behaved towards me is outrageous. It is disrespectful. It is disgusting. 'They don’t even refer to her by name. They refer to her as the deceased, or the body, or the dead and my daughter is not dead. 'They are awful, they have no compassion.' Backing: Terri Schaivo was at the center of a right-to-life debate that captivated the United States for several years in the late 90s and early 2000s, and a foundation set up in her name is supporting Jahi's family . Mrs . Winkfield, who has three other children, said all she wanted to do was . get her daughter away from the hospital to a place that cared for her. 'The doctors here pretty much want my daughter gone', she said. 'I want the same thing but I want her out of here alive, they want her out of here dead. 'I . blame the hospital for what happened. They should say ‘hey let’s do . what’s right for this little girl, we messed her up,  we owe her, the . least we can do is let her get out of here’.' She said she feels a mixture of anger, sadness and guilt. 'I feel angry at the hospital,' she said. 'Sad for my daughter and guilty because I made her have the operation. 'She . told me not to make her have the operation. She was scared. She said . her worst fear was never waking up, that’s what she told me. That is why . I feel guilty. 'I just wished I had picked a different hospital. When I first heard things had gone wrong,  I passed out from shock.'

She said she was puzzled why the hospital was blocking the family’s bid to move Jahi. 'I . think they are trying to cover up something and I think they would . rather she dies than I prove them wrong that she is alive,' she said. One . of the issues is that the hospital is refusing to fit a feeding tube . to the patient as they say they don’t operate on dead people. The operation must be carried out before a care facility can take her in. 'I . don’t believe what the hospital are saying,' said Mrs Winkfield, adding . that she believes her daughter is not getting the best treatment as she . is not an organ donor. I just have to keep faith. I just want to get her away from here. They don’t want her here. 'That’s why they are not feeding her, that’s why they don’t refer to her by her name. That’s why they call her the deceased.' Sam Singer, the spokesman for the . hospital, said that the family’s lawyer Chris Dolan was cruelly . perpetuating the 'hoax' that Jahi was still alive. He said it was a terribly sad case but that three doctors and the courts had agreed that there was no hope for the girl. Although . Jahi's family is receiving support from the Terri Schiavo foundation, . Children's Hospital spokesman Melinda Krigel says it has not heard . from any facility.","Jahi McMath, 13, has been declared brain-dead after tonsillectomy .

Marines and sailors will be subject to random blood-alcohol tests twice a year in what is billed as the toughest anti-drinking policy in the U.S. military. Starting January 1, any Marine or sailor with a blood-alcohol level of 0.01 per cent or higher may be referred for counseling. Anyone who tests at 0.04 per cent or higher will be referred to medical personnel to determine fitness for duty. In all 50 states and the District of Columbia, a driver with a 0.08 per cent blood-alcohol is considered drunk. A single drink can lead to a level of 0.01 per cent. The Marine Corps policy is primarily aimed at deterrence and education, but nothing precludes commanders from handing out punishments, Lt. Gen. R.E. Milstead Jr., deputy commandant for manpower and reserve affairs, said in a Dec. 12 directive. Breath-tests: Marines and sailors will be subject to random blood-alcohol tests twice a year in what is billed as the toughest anti-drinking policy in the U.S. military . The Corps is the first among the Army, Air Force and Navy to begin random mandatory testing of all personnel, according to The Washington Times, which reported on the new policy last week. The Army leaves test decisions up to a commander and prohibits a blood alcohol content of 0.05 percent or higher. The Air Force also instructs commanders to order alcohol tests when appropriate but has no compulsory program. The Navy will introduce mandatory tests sometime in January, Lt. Caroline Hutcheson, a Navy spokeswoman, said on Monday. A study in September by the Institute of Medicine, sponsored by the Department of Defense, found that binge drinking, often called 'sport drinking,' is increasing among military personnel in all branches, according to the Los Angeles Times. Binge-drinking: A study found that binge drinking, often called 'sport drinking,' is increasing among military personnel in all branches . In 1998, 35 per cent of personnel admitted to binge drinking in the previous year. In 2008, the last year for which statistics were available, that figure had risen to 47 per cent. Twenty per cent of personnel classified themselves as 'heavy' drinkers. Noting that 'alcohol has long been part of military culture,' the study's authors called for better leadership from the top of the chain of command in curbing excess drinking. Among the recommendations was 'routine screening for excessive alcohol consumption.' In the 2011 financial year, the last year for which statistics are available, the Marine Corps reported 13 alcohol-related deaths among Marines in this country and abroad, the Times reported. Included were Marines killed by vehicle and motorcycle crashes, one from falling 17 stories from a building, one from attempting to run across a freeway near Camp Pendleton and several that occurred during binge drinking when the Marine passed out and could not be revived. Under the Marine order, monthly reports about the results of the alcohol screening program will be kept by each Marine unit, and quarterly reports will be submitted to Marine Corps headquarters.","Starting January 1, any Marine or sailor with a blood-alcohol level of 0.01 per cent or higher may be referred for counseling .

Claim: Star Scientific claims its Anatabloc product may be useful in the treatment of traumatic brain injuries . A pharmaceutical company that suggested one of its products may be useful in preventing and treating traumatic brain injuries has had its wrists slapped by the U.S Food And Drug Administration (FDA) for misleading the public. Star Scientific, the company at the heart of a scandal involving the Virginia governor, claimed that its product Anatabloc may help with recovery from brain injury caused, for instance, by concussion. However, Gary Coody, the FDA’s National Health Fraud Coordinator, said: ‘We're very concerned that false assurances of faster recovery will convince athletes of all ages, coaches and even parents that someone suffering from a concussion is ready to resume activities before they are really ready.’ What’s more, in a warning letter dated December 20, Star Scientific has been told that it does not have permission to market Anatabloc, because it contains anatabine, a new dietary ingredient that needs federal approval to promote – something that the firm has yet to seek. Star Scientific has been at the center of a scandal involving Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell, a Republican whose term ends next month. Federal authorities are investigating the relationship between McDonnell and Star Scientific founder and former Chief Executive Jonnie Williams Sr, who sought state help promoting Anatabloc. McDonnell has acknowledged that he and his family accepted more than $160,000 in gifts and loans from Williams, a major campaign donor. But the governor has said Williams and Star Scientific received no grants or other help from the state. The FDA warned Star Scientific that its claims about Anatabloc's ability to treat brain injuries were misleading . In July, the governor apologized for embarrassing the state and repaid the loans. He said he returned the gifts to Williams. Williams resigned last week. He was replaced by Dr Michael Mullan, head of the Roskamp Institute, a research center. The FDA gave Star Scientific, of Glen Allen, Virginia, 15 days to say what steps it has taken to correct violations. In a statement on its website, Star said it was responding to the FDA and ‘has already advised the agency that it intends to work cooperatively to resolve these issues’.","Star Scientific claimed that its Anatabloc drug may help to treat brain injuries .

'Mediocre': Some students were not pleased that Prince William will be allowed to study at Cambridge after achieving only ABC at A-Level . Cambridge students have rounded on Prince William for getting a 'free pass' place at Cambridge University, while falling short of their usual exacting standards. The Duke of Cambridge, 31, was admitted to the prestigious institution for a 10-week 'bespoke' course in agricultural management, which will see him study for 18 to 20 hours a week at part of the university's school of Technology. But students and graduates were quick to point out that the Prince's 'mediocre' results from his A-Level studies at Eton were not up to the standards of the average Cambridge student. While the university now asks for two A grades and an A* at A-Level in order to study undergraduate courses - with even harsher offers for some - Prince William only achieved ABC in his studies. University newspaper The Tab noted in its report: 'The Tab must point out that normally students need A*AA at A-level to gain entry to Cambridge University, whilst the Prince only achieved a mediocre ABC.' Entry requirements for postgraduates such as the Prince - who already holds a geography degree from St Andrew's university - are not the same as for younger students. But his acceptance on the course has still been described as an 'insult' to everybody studying there. Melissa Berrill, who graduated with a Cambridge degree in French and German this summer, wrote in the Guardian that his presence would make it harder for the university to shake off its 'posh' image and attract less privileged students. She said: 'Admitting Prince William is an insult to every student, whatever their background, who got into Cambridge by getting the required A-level or degree results.' 'It's an insult to every student whose A-levels and degree are the same or better than his, and who didn't get a free pass to Cambridge in spite of them. Prestigious: Undergraduate students admitted to Cambridge usually require AAA* at A-Level . 'And it's an insult to everyone in the country who needs skills or training, and hasn't had a university course personally designed for them.' However, many students welcomed the news of Cambridge's newest royal. Charlotte Ivers, a first-year Philosophy student, described his arrival as 'a joyous coup' that would bring the university 'a lot of publicity in return'. She added: 'Has Oxford educated the next two monarchs of our great nation? Hell no.' The Prince continues a family tradition . by studying at Cambridge. His father Prince Charles graduated with a . degree in Archaeology and Anthropology in 1970, and George VI was also a . student there. Prince Phillip was Chancellor of the university from . 1976 to 2011. Runs in the family: Many royals have links to Cambridge. Prince Charles, pictured left as a first-year, studied at the university, while Prince Phillip, shown right in academic dress, was Chancellor for 35 years . A Kensington Palace spokesman said that Prince William is likely to spend two or three nights a week in Cambridge while studying. The Duke will not be awarded any qualification at the end of the course, which he is set to finish in mid-March. An aide said: â€˜Like his father, the Duke is very much a countryman, he enjoys and is passionate about the countryside and its people.","Prince William has been admitted to study agricultural management .

A first glance and your eyes might be tricked into thinking you are peering deep into Middle Earth or Mordor. But the steep inclines and towering mountains are in fact nestled in the heart of Snowdonia, North Wales at the site of a redundant slate quarry. Lord of the Rings author JRR Tolkien is known to have drawn inspiration from the Welsh language when he created the Elivsh dialect his mythical characters speak. And so it is possible the Dinorwic Quarry, which lies between Llanberis and Dinorwig, near Bangor, could have shaped the landscape Tolkien made home to characters including Gandalf, Aragorn and Frodo Baggins. Scroll down for video . Steep inclines frame an expanse of water in a scene, which you could be forgiven for thinking was straight from the set of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy . But the towering mountains pictured here are not those of the Elven outpost of Rivendell, created by JRR Tolkien. Rather they are the boundary of Dinorwic Quarry, once the second largest slate mining quarry in the world . The dramatic landscape of Snowdonia bears a striking resemblance with the backdrop used for the Lord of the Rings films starring Sir Ian McKellen, pictured playing Gandalf in the Fellowship of the Ring . Parts of the quarry could have been used to depict the mythical lands of Middle Earth, Mordor and Hobbiton, as seen in The Lord of the Rings: Two Towers, pictured above . Once the second largest slate mine of its kind, the vast quarry spans more than 700 acres. The dark grey slate chipped from the walls of the quarry was used for decades to make roof tiles for homes across Europe. As photographer Matthew Growcoot walked through the dramatic scenery, capturing these images, he said he felt as though Tolkien's Gandalf, played by McKellen, was lurking nearby. He said: 'The dramatic surroundings added to the epic feel of the quarry. 'Walking . around the place you really felt like you were on some kind of heroic . quest, all you needed was Gandalf to top it all off.' 'Part of the beauty is how untouched the . surrounding landscape is. All you could see for miles were mountains, . fields and a handful of villages,' said the 24-year-old from Birmingham. The redundant quarry was closed in July 1969 after hundreds of years producing slate, which was used to make roof tiles for homes across Europe . Different parts of the quarry resemble scenes from Rivendell, Hobbiton and Mordor, scenes made famous in the Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson . These slate towers, once a vital part of a piece of equipment which helped move the mined slate to the quarry floor, resembles the geography of Mordor . It is not just the landscape that could have inspired JRR Tolkien, the author is known to have drawn on the Welsh language in creating the Elvish dialect of his characters . Photographer Matthew Growcoot captured the images. He said: 'Walking around the place you really felt like you were on some kind of heroic quest, all you needed was Gandalf to top it all off' At the height of production in the 19th Century the quarry produced 100,000 tonnes of slate each year . The first attempts at slate mining took place at Dinorwic in 1787 when a private partnership secured a lease from the landowner Assheton Smith. The attempts were beginning to look fruitful but were dashed by the outbreak of war with France and rising tax and transportation costs. In 1809 Assheton Smith himself formed a new partnership. The construction of a horse-drawn . tram line to Port Dinorwic in 1824 gave the quarry a boost, and the . business began to flourish. At its peak in the 19th Century the quarry produced around 100,000 tonnes of slate each year and employed around 3,000 men. By 1930, that number had dropped to 2,000, but the quarry continued a steady production of slate until its closure in 1969. The quarry was closed in July 1969, leaving the 300 people still working there out of a job. In its heyday the quarry employed 3,000 local men . The eerie lighting adds to the feeling that the landscape could be that which is inhabited by Tolkien's mythical characters . Dinorwic Quarry was carved out of Elidir mountain and made up of two main quarry sections and workers used an elaborate network of trams to navigate their way around the vast industrial hub. By the 1960s extracting the slate had become difficult. After 170 years of chipping away at the landscape, parts of the quarry were beginning to slide into some of the major pit workings. A major slide in 1966 nearly ground production to a halt permanently. Work continued for another two and a half years before the quarry was closed in July 1969, leaving the 300 remaining members of staff to find work. The quarry is now home to the Welsh National Slate Museum and is a popular spot with rock climbers. A section of the quarry is used as part of the Dinorwig power station, a hydroelectric scheme. In the past the disused mine has been used as the setting for films, including scenes from the 1987 film Willow and Clash of the Titans. The quarry lies in the heart of Snowdonia, between the villages of Llanberis and Dinorwig in North Wales . An elaborate tram network linked the two main sections of the quarry, which spans more than 700 acres . It is not just the landscape of North Wales, which could have provided inspiration for Tolkien. The Lord of the Rings author was known to be heavily influenced by the Welsh language. Dr Carl Phelpstead of Cardiff University told the BBC in an interview in 2011 that the Elvish language bears a very close resemblance to Welsh. He said the author knew both the modern and medieval language very well, adding: 'It's not so much that he borrowed Welsh words, more the sounds. 'This particular Elvish language is very like the sounds of Welsh and deliberately so. 'I have a friend of mine who is a native Welsh speaker who went to see the Lord of the Rings films and when they started speaking Elvish in the film she turned to her daughter and said 'they are speaking Welsh' so people do see this relationship.'","Steep inclines, towering mountains and deep valleys trick your eyes into thinking you are peering into Middle Earth .

Relief: Neon Roberts, whose mother Sally tried to stop him having radiotherapy, has been given the all-clear after the treatment . A year ago, Neon Roberts was being taken to hospital for emergency surgery and radiotherapy on a brain tumour, against the wishes of his mother. This Christmas, however, he is celebrating – after finally being given the all-clear following his life-saving treatment. Neon was diagnosed with the tumour last year and had surgery to remove it in October. He found himself at the centre of a bitter court battle after doctors said he needed a second operation and radiotherapy – and his mother, Sally Roberts, tried to stop the treatment from going ahead. Mrs Roberts, who thinks doctors have been ‘brainwashed’ by pharmaceutical companies, ran away to stop them ‘frying his brain’. She took Neon to an alternative medicine centre in Sussex where he was given oxygen chamber therapy. After a four-day manhunt, the pair were found by police. She took her case to the High Court, but a judge ruled Neon had to be treated conventionally. He was ordered to live with his father and had his second operation days before Christmas. Yesterday his father, Ben Roberts, revealed that after undergoing rounds of radiotherapy  and chemotherapy, Neon is in remission. And his family said the eight-year-old boy is now ‘bouncing around’, despite his gruelling year. Mr Roberts, 35, told the Daily Mail: ‘We are delighted to be able to share our family’s joy that all Neon’s scans, including one last week, have shown no sign of the cancer returning. ‘The treatment so far has been successful and on Monday the doctors told us that while Neon will continue to need to be monitored, this radio and chemotherapy phase is over. We couldn’t have wished for a better Christmas present.’ Mr Roberts, an IT consultant from West London, said the past year had been extremely difficult but described doctors at the hospital where he was treated as ‘exceptional’ and praised his son for battling through so bravely. Fight: Neon (left) was caught in a bitter High Court battle after his father Ben, 35, wanted him to have radiotherapy (left). His mother Sally, 37, insisted doctors had been brainwashed by drugs giants (right) He currently has custody of Neon. Mrs Roberts, who spent last Christmas away from her son and his twin sister, Elektra, is prohibited from removing him from her estranged husband’s care. Mr Roberts added: ‘Last October we received news that every parent dreads, Neon had a brain tumour that would kill him if he did not have treatment. Neon’s mother and I faced agonising decisions. We each reacted differently. Neon then embarked on a long cycle of radio and chemotherapy. Treatment and recovery has been Neon’s journey this year.’ He added: ‘It’s been hard for him and his family. We’ve been touched by the numerous messages of support we have received.’ Neon’s aunt, Lucy Roberts, added: ‘We are delighted that the scan is clear. Everyone is so happy. We want people to know Neon’s happy and he’s doing really well. I saw him and he was bouncing around.’ Mrs Roberts, a DJ originally from New Zealand, declined to comment on her son’s recovery last night.","Eight-year-old was the focus of a bitter High Court battle over his treatment .

Britain's elderly should be allowed to choose how to die, ‘with a nice glass of whisky and a pleasing pill,’ writer Dame Margaret Drabble said yesterday. She claimed it was grotesque to refuse assisted suicide for the terminally or incurably ill and that medical advances artificially prolonged life. Allowing assisted suicide would mean doctors could help people to die without fear of prosecution, she said.

Lord Falconer’s assisted dying bill would enable terminally ill patients with no more than six months to live to be prescribed a fatal dose of drugs, if they can show they have a ‘clear and settled intention’ to end their lives. Supporters say it offers a humane end to life for patients with a terminal diagnosis, although it does not address dementia or patients with a longer-term chronic condition. But critics, including several senior peers, have argued the proposal would be a ‘blank cheque’ for euthanasia and a threat to public safety as it could be abused.

Maureen Hinckley told the Worcester Telegram & Gazette that the drawing came two days before her 58th birthday. Yet the couple and their immediate family decided to keep their huge win secret until they had worked out the best course of action. Maureen played the numbers (1, 10, 13, 18, 19 â€“ plus the Power Ball number 27), a combination of family birth dates, since Powerball came to Massachusetts.

The FDA has warned that dietary supplements being marketed to treat traumatic brain injuries such as concussion have no proof to back them up. An alert has been issued by the FDA about products that exploit the public's concern about concussions which are 'untested, unproven and possibly dangerous.' One company, Star Scientific, has filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, that claims its product anatabine can 'alleviate the negative consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI).' Warning: The FDA says products like Anatabloc are making unproven claims about their ability to aid traumatic brain injuries . 'We're very concerned that false assurances of faster recovery will convince athletes of all ages, coaches and even parents that someone suffering from a concussion is ready to resume activities before they are really ready,' says Gary Coody, FDA's National Health Fraud Coordinator. Anatabine is being marketed as a treatment for TBI, but being sold as a dietary supplement in the form of Anatabloc. Under law, a dietary supplement may not contain an ingredient that has already been submitted for investigation as a drug. Political ties: Star Scientific CEO Johnnie Williams with Virginia First Lady Maureen McConnell . 'While anatabine has been authorized as an investigational new drug, it is also considered a new dietary ingredient, which is subject to premarket notification,' an FDA spokeswoman said. The seeming epidemic of suicides and debilitating neurological disorders among former footballers and soldiers means that public concern about concussions is at an all-time high. 'We first learned from the military about a product being marketed to treat TBI, obviously a concern with wounded veterans. We were taken aback that anyone would make a claim that a supplement could treat TBI, a hot-button issue,' says Jason Humbert, a senior regulatory manager with FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs. 'That sparked our surveillance.' Star Scientific is the third company to receive a warning for the FDA for marketing unproven TBI drugs. Money talks: Virginia Governor Bob McConnell's term ends January 11, but he remains under investigation by the FBI for bribery after receiving $150,000 from Johnnie Williams during his term . Star Scientific has previously come in for unwanted attention over its CEO Johnnie Williams friendship with Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. McDonnell acknowledged receiving up to $150,000 in gifts from Williams, including $15,000 to help pay for his daughter's 2011 wedding. He's now under investigation by the FBI. The company's website says Star Scientific's original mission was to create products using anatabine, found in tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, potatoes and tobacco to help people quit smoking. The company says its now shifted its focus to the anti-inflammatory aspects of anatabine. 'As we continue to work on this problem, we can't guarantee you won't see a claim about TBIs,' Coody says. 'But we can promise you this: there is no dietary supplement that has been shown to prevent or treat them. If someone tells you otherwise, walk away.'","The FDA has issued an alert about 'possibly dangerous' products being marketed as beneficial to traumatic brain injuries (TBI)

A fisherman has described his terrifying ordeal lost at sea after falling off his lobster trawler and into the Atlantic Ocean - 40 miles from shore. John Aldridge, 45, had been alone on the deck of his boat the Anna Mary, with his partner asleep below, when a hook on to which he was holding snapped and propelled him off the end of the open boat into the chilly waters off Long Island. He yelled for help but the boat, on autopilot, was quickly out of sight, its disappearing lights a sign of how desperate a situation he was in. John Aldridge describes how he spent 12 hours clinging to his rubber boats to keep him afloat after he fell off his lobster trawler into the Atlantic, 40 miles from Montauk, Long Island . Mr Aldridge shared his remarkable tale of survival with the New York Times. He . runs a successful lobster and crab business with school friend Mr Sosinski after moving . to Montauk to take up fishing and buying the vessel the Anna Mary in 2006. The business partners were on one of the twice-weekly, 18-hour overnight trips when near tragedy occurred at 3.30am on July 24, 2013. Once in the water, Mr Aldridge managed to stay afloat by taking off his bulky green rubber fishing boots, . trapping air in each one and lodging them under his armpits while he kept treading water. The weather was clear and the water, although not warm, the seasoned fisherman was able to stand. As dawn approached, he made plans to . attach himself to something larger in the water so that he would be more . visible to rescue teams. It was then he saw two shark fins circling. He grabbed his knife from his pocket and waited for them to approach but . thankfully, they swam away. Lobsterman John Aldridge lies on a stretcher at Air Station Cape Cod in Sandwich, Massachusetts after being rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter . Lucky: John Aldridge, 45, fell off his lobster boat into the Atlantic off Long Island last summer and was rescued off the coast of the New York island . Mr Aldridge set out on his boat the Anna Mary from Montauk harbor in Long Island, New York last July only for disaster to strike . Several . hours later, Mr Aldridge's partner Anthony Sosinski awoke and quickly realized . with horror that his friend had become lost at sea at some point in the nine hours he had been below deck. The Anna Mary was at this point now 60 miles off shore. He immediately alerted the coastguard in New Haven and a desperate search began. Soon . a mission was in full swing - two coast guard boats were sent from . Montauk, two helicopters and a plane left Boston while a cutter from New . York redirected itself to the east. The . coastguard issued instructions that a man had gone overboard between . five and 60 miles off shore - a vast search area the size of Rhode . Island, almost impossible to cover by a search team alone. At best estimates, experts worked out that Mr Aldridge could survive 19 hours in the water. The lost fisherman had one thing in his favor - a new search-and-rescue computer program put in place in 2007 - which analyzed wind and ocean currents to work out at what points he would most likely be. However despite the reliability of the machinery, there was one fatal flaw. Search and rescue teams believed that Mr Aldridge likely fell overboard at 10.30pm - when in fact he fell into the water five hours later. The initial search and rescue mission was massively skewed. John Aldridge fell overboard off the coast of Long Island, New York. The New England Coast Guard team launched a massive collaborative search to locate Aldridge . The fisherman is helped off a search and rescue helicopter after his ordeal lost at sea last July . However one coast guard Pete Winters was having second thoughts about relying so heavily on technology. He . spoke to the distraught Captain Sosinski to learn more. Sosinski revealed that his partner . had been preparing the boat to receive the day's catch, meaning the boat . would have been further from shore. A new set of data was entered and the search for the lost seamen altered to coordinates further south. After Mr Aldridge's parents were informed of his disappearance and as the news spread among the fishing community of Montauk, 21 commercial boats joined the search for the missing man. While the search mission intensified, Mr Aldridge floated alone on the sea. His legs were cramping as he searched for a buoy to hang on to, the sun blinded him and he was suffering from exhaustion and thirst. After several hours of searching, he found a small buoy to hang on to but his physical state was deteriorating after nine hours in the water. The veteran fisherman was shaking and sea lice had attached themselves to his thin clothes. He could see the planes overhead but they were too far east, so using the last of his strength he began to swim. Once again he saw his boat the Anna Mary ahead of him - but it was just out of reach. Fortunately, he soon reached another buoy. He clung to the rope attached to it and stuck his rubber boots under his arms to keep him afloat. Meanwhile, the rescue crews found false alarm after false alarm. They knew that the chances of rescue were slim - each time someone fell into the Atlantic, the likelihood was that they drowned. Finally as one of the helicopters began its last search mission of the day on its final liters of fuel, there he was - John Aldridge floating in the water below them, clinging to his rubber boots. Mr Aldridge was flown to hospital in Cape Cod suffering from hypothermia, dehydration and exposure. However he has suffered no lasting ill-health or post-traumatic stress from the incident. He has returned to work and with it, to the sea.","John Aldridge, 45, fell off his lobster boat into the Atlantic off Long Island last summer ."

A grandmother who lives in a make-shift caravan has asked her local council to move her to a permanent address so she can claim benefits in her old age. Hannah Rose, 71, has demanded Ashford Borough Council in Kent find her disheveled trailer a place in a local campsite where she will be able to claim housing benefit. The former French teacher would also like to see her pension raised by almost £100-a-week, despite having paid hardly any tax her entire life. Hannah Rose, 71, has asked the council to recognise her make-shift caravan as a mobile home and provide it with a permanent address so she can claim benefits . The mother-of-three travelled for 17 years before returning to the UK in 1996 when she took up work  as a foreign language teacher with her second husband. Following the breakdown of their marriage, Ms Rose lived on a travellers' site in Surrey before moving into the trailer that she shares with her two cats. Now she wants council officials to find her a permanent spot on a campsite where she would be entitled to benefits that help cover the cost of site fees, but would not have to pay any council tax. The 71-year-old is being put up by the council in a £200-a-week B&B while they decide how to treat her case. Despite only paying National Insurance for five years, the grandmother sees no reason why she shouldn't receive benefits from the Government. 'I may not have contributed much financially but the French club I ran made a big difference,' she said. The grandmother put the trailer together using donated wood and furnishings. She lives there with her two cats . 'I think it's appalling the council doesn't have a list of static caravan sites to give someone who is trying to help themselves. 'The council cannot deal with people who are different. 'I would love to live in an eco community. I would like my freedom' 'I will be able to claim housing benefit from a static caravan, I desperately need an address.' Ms Rose added she was 'grateful' to have been put up in the hotel while she 'sorts herself out'. Supermarket bosses demanded she be moved after settling in a Sainsbury's car park in Ashford, Kent. Council spokesman Mark James said the authority is deciding what 'level of duty' it has to the grandmother who is a member of political campaign group, Avaaz. The mother-of-two, who is also a member of political campaign group Avaaz, feels she is entitled to receiving benefits as her own mother never received any and didn't even claim her pension . He said: 'We placed Hannah Rose in temporary accommodation on November 15 pending further investigations. 'She had an appointment booked in with our housing options team this week. 'We need to assess what level of duty we have to her and until we have had the opportunity to investigate her circumstances further we will not be able to comment.'","Hannah Rose is urging the council to give her trailer a permanent address .

New Zealand media has reported that Mr Key owns a home in Hawaii. Scroll down for video . Praising the flag: President Obama hit the links at the Marine Corps Base in Kaneohe, Hawaii on Thursday . Leading the pack: Obama played with New Zealand's prime minister John Key (right) who has a house in Hawaii and was there for the holidays with his family, just like the Obamas . In the hot seat: President Obama generally plays golf with close friends, and on rare occasions, political allies, but Mr Key is now one of the few foreign leaders who can add his name to the list . The golf outing put Key in rarified company as Obama, an avid golfer, prefers to limit his playing partners to a close circle of friends and advisers. Among those who have also scored invitations to play with Obama in the past are former President Bill Clinton and Republican House Speaker John Boehner. Rounding out the foursome Thursday were Max Key, the prime minister's teenage son, and Marvin Nicholson, Obama's personal aide. Media access to Obama's rounds is typically restricted, though reporters and photographers were permitted to briefly watch the two leaders Thursday.

Obama's first putt was short of the hole and his second landed just wide. Rather than putt a third time, he opted for a gimme shot, where all players agree to count a shot as made rather than take another stroke. After the younger Key sank his putt, Obama gave him a high-five and joked, 'He's doing it in front of the cameras, too.' Key has served as New Zealand's prime minister since 2008.

A lawyer for Elle McPherson's billionaire husband Jeffrey Soffer says a woman who filed a $100 million suit against him last month has withdrawn the lawsuit. Bob Martinez said that Daria Pastouhkova Gogoleva has voluntarily withdrawn the lawsuit over a helicopter accident that killed her husband, Lance Valdez, in 2012. The original complaint charged Soffer with illegally piloting a helicopter that crashed in the Bahamas, killing Valdez. As if nothing happened: Elle Macpherson and husband Jeff Soffer attend Perez Art Museum last week in Miami . 'We were not surprised by the decision . to withdraw this lawsuit, which was riddled with factual errors and . unfounded accusations,' Martinez said. 'The case collapsed . just a few weeks after the lawsuit was filed and widely publicized by . the other side and before we even had a chance to respond, confirming . that it was a frivolous lawsuit.' In the lawsuit, supermodel Elle Macpherson is accused . of helping her billionaire husband conceal he was flying the helicopter. Macpherson urged widow Daria Valdez to take the payout after husband . Jeffrey Soffer, who also owns Miami’s Fontainebleau Hotel, piloted the . chopper into the ground November 22, 2012 in the Bahamas, the lawsuit said. -Soffer was at the helm despite not being licensed to fly. A licensed . pilot was on board the aircraft but not at the controls, the suit . alleges. The $100million wrongful death suit was filed 10 December Miami. Dropped: Daria Gogoleva has dropped a suit against Jeffrey Soffer (seen here with wife Elle Macpherson) for piloting a helicopter that crashed in the Bahamas in November of 2012, in which Lance Valdez, a prominent tax attorney, died . A copy of the lawsuit reviewed by MailOnline claimed that Soffer was at the controls when the helicopter when it crashed on Great Cauna Cay last year, taking the life of tax lawyer Lance Valdez. ‘Contrary to published newspaper reports, at the time of the helicopter crash the helicopter was being piloted by Jeffrey Soffer,’ the suit claims. ‘Soffer was not licensed to fly,’ the suit continues. ‘[Nor was he a] sufficiently experienced helicopter pilot.’ The suit also accused supermodel Elle Macpherson of taking part in the conspiracy by personally  calling close friends for the purpose of having them convince the devastated widow to take the money. 'Soffer induced…Elle Macpherson…to call Charles Holzer, another close friend of both Lance and Daria, and told him that Soffer was annoyed about Daria’s delay in signing the release, telling Holzer that ‘Soffer doesn’t have to do this you know,' the suit alleged. Taking the millions in hush money meant signing a release relieving Mr Soffer of all liability stemming from the crash, according to the suit. Shattered: Dasha and Lance Valdez in a photo from 2008, the picture of happiness . 'They knew Daria was beset with grief…at the time that they inappropriately pressured her to sign a release they knew was based upon false information,' the suit said. 'They took undue and improper advantage of her and the situation and circumstances surrounding the helicopter crash,' it continued. Pilot David Pearce also signed a lawsuit guaranteeing him a six-figure salary with Mr Soffer's company in exchange for swearing he was piloting the helicopter at the time it crashed, according to the suit. Mr Valdez, 48 and a father of three, was joined on the flight by a handful of other people but was the only one who did not survive the accident, according to the suit. Daria Valdez, now a widow, claims in the suit she was handed $2million in insurance hush money to keep quiet about Mr Soffer piloting the chopper into the ground. According to the lawsuit, co-defendants Daniel and Paula Riordan, as well as Alex Krys, were also on board the ill-fated flight and conspired with Mr Soffer and the pilot to conceal who was actually flying the chopper when her husband died. ‘The defendants] conspired and otherwise agreed to conceal… [that Mr Soffer] was flying the helicopter at the time of the crash,’ the suit said. ‘The purpose of this concealment and deception was, in turn, to induce [Mr Valdez’s widow] to accept $2million in insurance proceeds from insurance maintained on the helicopter… and to withhold from any civil or other action against [Mr] Soffer,’ the suit explains. The Riordans are employees of Mr Soffer, Mr Krys is his COO, according to the suit. Ms Valdez, who goes by Dasha, according to the Post, was convinced to keep quiet about Mr Soffer’s involvement in her husband’s death while grieving over the loss of the father of her three young children – aged two, seven and nine. Living the high life: Mr Soffer and Ms Macpherson continue to enjoy the high life while Ms Valdez is left to care for her three young children without their father . Trouble in paradise: The helicopter crash happened last year at Great Guana Cay, in the Bahamas . Head of an empire: Billionaire Mr Soffer's assets include the famed Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami . Mr Soffer took advantage of her fragile emotional state in order to avoid ‘his own liability in an exponentially greater amount as compared to the $2million,’ according to the suit. 'Despite being responsible for the loss of his friend, [Mr] Soffer repeatedly lied to and intentionally deceived Daria about his involvement in the crash in an effort to persuade her to pursue an insurance recovery rather than a claim against him.' The suit also claims that Mr Soffer led Mr Valdez to believe he was a licensed and experienced pilot, as well as fled the scene while first responders tried to revive his best friend’s lifeless body. The hotel magnate is licensed to fly - fixed airplanes, not helicopters. 'He was recklessly flying and controlling the helicopter at the time of the helicopter crash without an up-to-date and valid helicopter pilot's license,' the lawsuit further claims. ‘Soffer arranged to have himself and the Riordans transported by boat… in order to escape, flee and/or remove himself and the Riordans from the Bahamas before any investigation of the crash could be conducted,’ according to the suit. He did not contact Mr Valdez’s widow until four days later, and also skipped his pal’s funeral. 'Jeff Soffer is very sympathetic to Dasha and the children for their grave loss [and] denies all the allegations of wrongdoing,' his lawyer told the New York Post in a statement. 'Mr. Soffer has no further comments to make at this time since the lawsuit is now pending in federal court.'","A lawsuit claiming billionaire Jeffrey Soffer crashed a helicopter he was illegally piloting, killing lawyer Lance Valdez, has been withdrawn .

"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 18:34 EST, 2 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 03:23 EST, 3 January 2014 . Alarm about immigration is soaring among the middle classes, a study revealed yesterday. As Britain prepares for a new influx from Bulgaria and Romania, the number seeing immigration as the most serious issue facing the country has risen by half in a year. It signals a new shift in public opinion. While the lower-paid and those in low-skilled jobs have long seen competition from migrants as a threat to their jobs and earnings, higher earners have been assumed to benefit. Passengers check-in for a Wizzair flight from Henri Coanda airport, Bucharest, Romania to arrive at Luton airport . They have found it cheaper to hire plumbers, nannies and other household workers following the arrival of a million Eastern Europeans since 2004 – and have not suffered competition for their professional or highly skilled jobs. But the study by Ipsos MORI found that fears about the impact of high immigration on hospitals, schools, transport, housing and utilities have begun to undermine middle-class complacency over the issue. The analysis, based on a series of polls since 2010, shows that among those classed by the advertising industry as A, B and C1 – those in professional and managerial jobs – the proportion who think immigration is the country's most serious problem rose from around 20 per cent in 2012 to 30 per cent in 2013. It found that those on less than £30,000 are most worried about the threat to their jobs and incomes posed by migrants. Among the lowest paid, nearly 45 per cent said this was their main concern. But the study found that higher earners are now worried about the threat to public services. Among those who believe immigration is a problem in Britain, 36 per cent of those on £30,000 to £50,000, 42 per cent of people on £50,000 to £75,000 and 44 per cent of those on over £75,000 are most concerned about the impact on services and potential drain on the benefits system. The analysis said that in the early 2000s, when Labour's open-door immigration policy was beginning to take effect, a gap quickly opened between the manual classes and the highest social class. Passengers put their luggage in a bus departing for Western Europe at the central bus station in Sofia, Bulgaria . 'However, this gap was somewhat closed later in the 2000s, and by 2013 there was much less difference between the classes,' the Perception and Reality report said. 'Concern about immigrants as a drain on public service resources rises significantly with income, while job-related concern declines as income rises. 'Concern about housing is at a similar level for those with incomes below £30,000 a year, and significantly lower for those with incomes above that.' There is growing acceptance among economists that large-scale migration since 1997 has squeezed the incomes of the lowest-paid. Official poverty figures also indicate that the rise in the number in work who live on incomes below the state poverty line has been occurring not from the beginning of the recession in 2007 but since 2004 – the year that Eastern European migrants began to arrive in large numbers. The Ipsos MORI study also confirmed that longer-established migrants increasingly share the concern about high immigration levels. It said that 70 per cent of migrants who arrived before 1970 now want a cut in immigration, similar to the overall national figure. Among more recent immigrants, the figure is 28 per cent. The study was based on surveys from the Office for National Statistics, the Home Office, the independent British Social Attitudes survey and other polls, including a number carried out by Ipsos MORI.","Study by Ipsos MORI found fears about high immigration .

More often associated with armed robbers than trend- setters, the balaclava is experiencing an unlikely revival. Several designers have produced luxury versions, including Louis Vuitton and Chanel, whose balaclava features the label’s famous double ‘C’ logo. The trend has found a host of celebrity fans — perhaps balaclavas come in handy when dodging fans. Model Lily Cole keeps well covered up in a grey balaclava, left, while pop star Justin Bieber models a Chanel version complete with the company's iconic double C logo . Singer Beyonce was spotted leaving a recording studio in LA in a Louis Vuitton number which showed only her (elaborately made-up) eyes. And both model Cara Delevingne and One Direction’s Harry Styles have been seen wearing balaclavas made by streetwear label Black Score. Lily Cole was spotted completely obscured by hers and Justin Bieber tweeted a photo of himself in the Chanel version. It’s a long way from the balaclava’s origin as a garment to protect British troops from the cold during the Crimean War of the 1850s. Then, hundreds of knitted balaclavas were sent over from the UK. They came to be known as ‘balaclava helmets’, after the Crimean town of Balaklava.","Louis Vuitton and Chanel among designers producing luxury versions .

A restaurant owner and ex-cop was caught off guard when a brazen burglar entered his steakhouse and walked out with a 250-pound safe. Kevin Hynes owns Stockholders Steakhouse in South Weymouth, Massachusetts where the burglary happened last Sunday, during the busy dinner hours. 'It was almost like a perfect storm, he had some kind of information, I'm thinking from the inside or someone that knew what was going on here at the time,' co-owner Erik Hynes told Fox 25. Scroll down for video . Brazen: A burglar was caught on camera entering Stockholders steakhouse in Weymouth, Massachusetts Sunday night and making off with the restaurant's safe . Inside source: During the six minute heist, the burglar remained on his cellphone leading the restaurant's owners to believe that he was getting information and it was an inside job . Right under their noses: The burglar conceals the 250-pound safe in a garbage bag and walks out of the restaurant without notice . Surveillance footage shows a man wearing a hat and tan jacket enter the restaurant through a side door before going down the stairs and into the storage room, all while on the phone. 'That tells me it was one of the employees, an inside job,' Kevin Hynes told CBS Boston. 'Or it was one of the delivery guys.' At one point the burglar passes a manager on the floor, who gives him a second look, but moves on without raising suspicion because people come in and out of the restaurant all day. From there, the burglar forces his way into the office where he picks up the 250 pound safe and walks right out of the restaurant without attracting notice, using a trash bag to conceal his loot. Caught off guard: Stockholders is co-owned by former policeman Kevin Hynes who says he's never heard of such a brazen burglary .

'This guy was a big guy. He knew it was a one man job, he knew his size, he could pull it off and he did' Erik Hynes said. They wouldn't say how much cash was in the safe when it was stolen, but Kevin Hynes said 'it was enough to hurt'.

Police are seizing almost one cannabis plant a minute in Britain – with more than 1,000 a week found by one police force alone. A production boom has turned thousands of suburban homes into cannabis farms. Officers carried out 17 raids an hour across Britain last year, swooping on more than 100,000 growers, ranging from small suppliers who have converted their lofts and garages, to huge marijuana factories. Scroll down for video . Uncovered: Some of the plants officers in Manchester have seized as part of Operation Cairo. Officers seized 51,000 plants in 2013 - one plant was confiscated every 10 minutes . In total more than 500,000 plants were . recovered, almost one a minute. In addition, 3,779kg of herbal cannabis . and 4,155kg of resin was seized. Home Office figures show the biggest . hauls were in the West Midlands where 61,177 plants were recovered. In . 2008 the average number of cannabis farms discovered every month was . 252, rising to a monthly 656 in 2012. Greater . Manchester was named as the cannabis capital of Britain with almost a thousand . plants seized by police every week, it has emerged. Just 2,900 more plants were taken off the streets of London – despite the capital's population being four times higher. Greater Manchester Police made more than 9,000 drugs seizures in the region in 2012/13, including 58.9kg of cocaine – a six-fold rise on the previous year. Staggering: 53,900 plants were taken off the streets of London despite the capital's population being four times higher than that of Manchester . They also seized 42kg of amphetamines and 90kg of heroin, compared with 5.5kg of heroin in the previous year. But . the biggest haul was in cannabis. In addition to the 51,000 plants . seized, officers also seized 217kg of herbal cannabis and 131kg of . cannabis resin. The figures also show the force is taking a gram of cannabis resin off the streets on average every four minutes, a gram of heroin every six minutes, and a gram of cocaine every nine minutes. The news follows a huge push by Greater Manchester Police to smash drugs networks, which has seen a series of high-profile raids on dealers. Greater Manchester Police made more drugs seizures in total than any police force outside London. One of the GMP's most successful ever drugs crackdowns, Operation Cairo, was launched last year and saw 45 criminals jailed for a total of 144 years in prison. The operation was launched in Cheetham Hill because the area had become the go-to area for users across the region. Daytime dealers were rooted out after police went undercover as addicts, using dial-a-drug numbers with nicknames like the 'Snickers Line' and the 'Snowy Line' to buy cannabis for as little as £5 a wrap. One man was arrested earlier this year after cannabis plants worth £250,000 were seized from a house in Wigan. And in October, five men from Greater Manchester were jailed after police smashed an £8m cannabis ring. Police have described the conviction as 'biggest ever prosecution for cannabis supply in the UK'. In November, police found a giant cannabis farm spread across two terrace houses in Miles Platting containing £180,000 of the potent herb. Bosses at a leading charity that supports professionals who work in drug and alcohol treatment, drug education and prevention and criminal justice, says it is vital that funding is not cut for treatment for addicts. Notorious: Operation Cairo was launched in Manchester's Cheetham Hill (pictured) because it had become the go-to area for drug users across the region . Cannabis plants seized during a raid by Greater Manchester Police as part of Operation Cairo . Harry Shapiro from the DrugScope charity said: 'These seizures shouldn’t come as any surprise as Manchester, like other cities, is a hub of the drug culture in the UK. It has been this way since the heroin epidemic of the recession in the 1980s. The culture has been fairly well embedded for some time.' He added: 'Although overall the drug use is generally on the decline, there are still hotspots and Manchester is clearly one of those.' 'Manchester is well-served by support organisations, our main concern is over funding for treatment.' 'Local authorities are now in charge of treatment. They are under huge pressure and some are making swingeing cuts. Our concern is that this investment will start to be cut in the next couple of years.'","51,000 plants were seized by Greater Manchester Police in 2013 .

Andrew Welsh, 35, was arrested after he was discovered at the schoolgirl's home . He was reportedly caught hiding under the girl's bed by her mother . The offences are said to have taken place between May and July last year. The court heard legal arguments about whether the girl was still registered as a pupil at the school when some of the offences allegedly took place. Peter Hayes, defending, told the court that the 'majority' of the alleged sexual activity took place after the girl was no longer enrolled at the school. Therefore, he claimed, any sexual activities that happened after the 28 June were 'not criminal offences'. Welsh, who has a partner, did not enter any pleas and the case was adjourned until January 29 when he will appear before magistrates again. He was granted bail on condition that he lives at his home address, surrenders his passport, attends a police station twice a week and has no unsupervised contact with a child under 16.

William Flynn, 36, targeted homes across Southend and London, taking diamonds, jewellery and designer watches in what a judge described as 'skillful and well planned' operation . He claimed to be a millionaire Kazakh oligarch looking for a house in one of Britain’s most expensive streets. So when William Flynn arrived at the £32million home of Formula One heiress Petra Ecclestone in a chauffeur-driven Bentley, estate agents were only too happy to show him around – twice. Despite refusing to remove his  sunglasses and speaking in an accent  likened to Sacha Baron Cohen’s comic character Borat, no one suspected the prospective housebuyer until ‘irreplaceable’ gems worth £450,000 were found to be missing. Yesterday, as the conman was jailed for eight years for the theft, it emerged that he was a serial burglar who stole £803,140 worth of designer watches and jewellery in a spree across  London and the Home Counties. Described as ‘cocky and brazen’, Flynn, 36, cruised around in a stolen BMW X5 worth £70,000 booking viewings of houses on the market for more than £1million. He would help himself to jewellery when estate agents turned their back and was caught only after he targeted the Belgravia home Petra shares with husband James Stunt and baby daughter Lavinia. Calling himself Oleg Duchenko, Flynn was chauffeur-driven in a Bentley to the property on June 19. He made one visit before arranging a second viewing later that day. While estate agents were showing him round the second time, Flynn asked to make a telephone call in private, said Joseph Abadoo, prosecuting. ‘He was permitted to do so and enter the jewellery room on the second floor unaccompanied,’ said Mr Abadoo. ‘Following this the defendant indicated that he liked the property and would make an offer later that day. It was only the next day that it was noticed that the items were missing.’ The serial burglar posed as a Kazakh tycoon to steal a diamond Rolex and a pair of earrings from Formula One heiress Petra Stunt (formerly Ecclestone) in a £450,000 raid He was chauffeur driven to the property which he pretended he was interested in buying . The court was told that Flynn stole . heart-shaped earrings worth £400,000 and a £50,000  diamond-encrusted . Rolex watch. They have not been recovered. The . 25-year-old daughter of Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone – who now . uses her married name Petra Stunt – was out with a friend during Flynn’s . viewing of her home.

Shefiran said: ‘My boss is very upset and distressed by the intrusion . into her home. ‘The watch . was of extremely sentimental value and was a gift from her husband on a . special occasion – this can never be replaced. ‘The earrings were a very expensive and treasured item. The incident has had a devastating lasting impact on all concerned.’ The . court heard that Flynn raided 35 properties while still on licence . after being released early in August 2012 from a 42-month sentence for a . series of thefts and burglaries. They included the theft of a . 79-year-old woman’s handbag after he entered her home using fake ID.

Lay-offs at the Environment Agency will affect the organisation’s ability to cope with flooding, bosses said last night. More than 550 staff who work in flood risk management could lose their jobs as part of restructuring to save money. The news comes as Britain is hit by extreme weather yet again, leading to widespread flood warnings across the country. Scroll down for video . Flooding: Government cuts could make it harder to deal with extreme events such as the floods in Yalding, Kent over the past couple of weeks . In some areas, flood water has yet to recede two weeks after a huge storm crippled transport networks and left thousands without power in the run-up to Christmas. Paul Leinster, the agency’s chief executive, said maintenance work would be hit and new developments would have to be ‘resized’. ‘Flood risk maintenance will be impacted,’ he told The ENDS Report, an environmental magazine. ‘And we’re looking at a proportionate reduction in the number of people in flood risk management.’ Underwater: Around 550 staff dealing with the risks of flooding are set to lose their jobs . Extreme: Britain has been battered by heavy rain and strong winds over the past two weeks . The planned staff losses come despite a funding increase from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. That money will go to long-term capital spending mitigating the impact of future storms - but there are concerns the employee cuts will reduce the effectiveness of the new funds. A spokesman for the agency downplayed the staffing cuts, adding: ‘Our budget for 2014-15 will be confirmed shortly. ‘However, we are likely to reduce staff numbers from the previous forecast of around 11,250 at the end of March 2014 to around 9,700 by October 2014 dependent on future funding. Picture of Britain: After more than a month of terrible weather, large swathes of the country face serious flood threats with the majority in central and western England today . ‘We will then aim to keep numbers broadly at that level, through to March 2015, dependent of course on future funding.’ Last week, David Cameron paid tribute to the work of Environment Agency workers in helping flood-affected householders. During a visit to Yalding in Kent, he said they had done 'an amazing job with the floods and extreme weather'. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson also praised the agency, telling the public that paying attention to its warnings was the best way to keep safe during storms.","More than 550 flood workers are set to lose their jobs at agency .

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the government did not want to be in the 'business of vetoing aspiration' Council houses are to be sold off for just 30 per cent of their market value to help more people get on the property ladder. The government is to increase the discount available under the Right to Buy scheme first launched by Margaret Thatcher from 60 to 70 per cent. Ministers said they did not want to be in the ‘business of vetoing aspiration’ and wanted to make it easier for families to own their own home. David Cameron has ordered the government to do more to boost home ownership, increasing the numbers who can access taxpayer-backed mortgages and buying council houses. Today it emerged house prices have soared by 8.4 per cent in the last year, fuelling fears of a new property price bubble. House prices in Manchester have surged by 21 per cent, the fastest rate anywhere in the country. Critics say a lack of new homes being built means supply is failing to keep pace with rising demand, and as prices soar many on low incomes will see the dream of buying a house disappear. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles today announced that from this year council houses will be available to buy at a discount of 70 per cent. A £75,000 cap on the cash value of the discount will also start rising in line with the CPI rate of inflation in a bid to revitalise the Right to Buy scheme. Labour said the Government was failing on its promise to replace each and every home sold under right to buy and reiterated the party's pledge to build 200,000 homes if it wins power in 2015. Mr Pickles said increasing the discount on houses from 60 per cent to 70 per of the full market price would drive aspiration and allow an acceleration in the rate Government delivers new affordable homes. The discount now matches that available on flats. He said: ‘For years the Right to Buy was slowly strangled, with a miserly cap on discounts killing the prospect of home ownership for most social tenants. ‘We don’t think governments should be in the business of vetoing aspiration. ‘That’s why we reinvigorated the Right Buy. It’s all part of our long-term economic plan to make Britain a country on the rise, where hard working people can be rewarded with the security and peace of mind that comes from owning their own home. ‘We’ll also continue to plough the cash from additional sales back into delivering new affordable homes for rent, which will help drive up the rate of housebuilding across the country.’ Life-changing: David Cameron, pictured tea with Sharon Ray and her daughter Maisie, 2, during a visit to her home in Southampton, Hampshire wants to help more people to buy their own home . A department spokesman said the law will need to be changed to bring in the increased discount before May. But . Labour’s shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said: ‘The Tory-led . Government has failed to build the homes our country needs. ‘Housebuilding is at its lowest peacetime level since the 1920s, contributing to the cost-of-living crisis families face. ‘David . Cameron has also broken his promise to replace every home sold through . right to buy with another built. Only one home has been built for every . seven homes sold.’ The . changes come into effect at the beginning of the new tax year in April . and Mr Pickles said there would be a £100 million fund to boost access . to mortgages and provide right to buy ‘agents’ to help people through . the process. Price map: Manchester performed best among major towns and cities, with average house prices up 21 per cent to £209,627 . The Department for Communities and Local Government said 50,000 household had got onto the housing ladder since 2011, including 13,400 via the right to buy scheme. The 50,000 figure represents the total of new property owner households aided by the Government, not the whole housing market. It also includes 36,000 assisted on to the property ladder through the Help to Buy and earlier schemes.","Discount under Right to Buy to rise from 60% to 70%, ministers announce .

In his 73 years behind the wheel, Dennis Garratt, who has just turned 100, has clocked well over a million miles without an accident or a traffic ticket. The retired RAF veteran from Uppingham, Rutland, has no intention of taking his foot off the pedal and giving up his four wheels, still regularly using his red Renault Cleo to shuttle back and forth from the shops. Mr Garratt first began driving in Italy during the Second World War aged 27 and is still enjoying being behind the wheel today. Lifeline: Dennis Garratt has been driving for 73 years, first learning to drive in an army van in Italy during World War Two. He says those calling for pensioners to retire from driving are 'talking rubbish' With years of driving experience he has criticised anyone who calls for pensioners to retire from the road, saying they were 'talking rubbish' because he, like many other OAPs, is still capable. Mr Garratt explained: 'The trouble is the modern young man, they drive too fast, they like to show off. They are always in a hurry'. He said: 'Young people are rude drivers and are not aware of their surroundings. They are the problem on the road, not pensioners. 'To me a car is a practical item, not an object to pose in... I am a confident driver and have still have quick reactions, to me driving is second nature,' Mr Garratt added. Although technology has advanced in leaps and bounds since his first car, he still has fond memories of the MOD van he first learnt to drive in. Social: Dennis Garratt still regularly uses his red Renault Clio to drive to the shop or visit friends for coffee . Then and now: RAF veteran Dennis Garratt first learnt to drive in Italy during the Second World War (left). He has now been driving for 73 years and says pensioners are often more capable than young people on the roads . Mr Garratt says the trouble with driving today 'is the modern young man, they drive too fast, they like to show off. They are always in a hurry'. He thinks young people are rude drivers and not aware of their surroundings . The Driving and Vehicle Licencing Authority (DVLA) insists that all UK drivers apply to renew their license at the age of 70. As part of the renewal process, drivers must declare any mental or physical condition that could impair their driving, although there is no legal requirement to sit a medical examination. There is also no requirement for drivers to retake their practical driving examination. The current law has led to concerns that elderly people could be continuing to drive despite being unfit to do so, and there have been calls to introduce a compulsory 'refresher' for those turning 70. On the other hand, charities including Rica have come forward to voice their concerns about societal pressure causing pensioners to give up driving too early and risk losing their access to services and activities. In September, the RAC announced that . for the first time ever the number of UK driving license holders over . the age of 70 had hit four million, with 191 of those over the age of . 100. Mr Garratt's driving experience spans the world and in the 1960s he and his wife Margaret towed a caravan 12,000 miles across Europe, driving through Germany, Netherlands, France and Spain. He said: 'I am an accomplished driver, having driven in various countries with different rules and regulations, I’ve had a lot of experience. I think having driven in different conditions, improves the way you drive and forces you to become more aware of the road and other users. I’ll know when it is time to stop driving.'With two replacement knees and a pacemaker, Mr Garratt admits that he does not expect to be driving by the time he turns 103. The father of one doesn’t travel very far in his car anymore, using it only to travel to the supermarket and coffee shop to visit friends. Mr Garrat’s red Renault Cleo is well know to residents in his hometown, with them all rushing to speak to him when they see him parking. 'I am well known to the local folk. They all can’t believe I’m still driving at the tender age of 100,' he joked. Mr Garratt added: 'They all rush to help . me load my groceries in the car and witness a 100 year old driving... I . love still being able to drive and see my friends. The ladies are also . impressed when I offer to give them a lift home when most other people . my age have to rely on a taxi or bus. In the 1960s Dennis Garratt and his late wife Margaret towed a caravan 12,000 miles across Europe, driving through Germany, Netherlands, France and Spain . 'My car is pretty basic, it doesn’t have power steering, so I also get a bit of a workout when I drive it.' Mr Garratt spent six years in the RAF and during the war served in Italy, North and sub-Saharan Africa and the middle East leaving as a squadron leader. He then worked in clothing manufacturing for 40 years. He has lived in Uppingham in Rutland for 26 years and met his late wife Margaret when they were both teenagers. There are 191 people allowed to drive on UK roads who, like Dennis Garratt (left), are aged 100 or over. He first learned to drive in a MoD van (right) during the Second World War, although his was a 1940s version . Sadly she died five years ago and Mr Garratt now lives alone but still has a busy social life, keeping active by using his car. He hopes to hold his licence for longer than his son Colin, who is 73.

Mr Garratt said: 'None of my friends drive or have cars anymore, so I wouldn’t see anyone if I didn’t drive. I would spend my days at home alone.' He added: 'If I didn’t have a car, being able to lead a full life would be finished. It’s my lifeline.'","Dennis Garratt has been driving for 73 years and insists it is his lifeline .

Francis Hudson went to the Employment Relations Authority after he was sacked by Auckland-based firm Japanese Spares Ltd last January . A man accused of avoiding his work duties by carving out a sleeping space in an office ceiling has won his case for unjustified dismissal. Francis Hudson went to the Employment Relations Authority after he was sacked by Auckland-based firm Japanese Spares Ltd last January. According to his employers, the delivery worker and storeman also slept in the car park, hid in the building during work hours, caused damage to parts by driving a forklift without a licence and refused to follow management instructions. Mr Hudson, who had worked at JSL for 19 months, claimed he had a personal grievance and was unjustifiably dismissed by the company. However, this was rejected by JSL, which presented evidence to the Authority regarding his cunning means of job shirking, the New Zealand Herald reported. Shameem Khan, the former manager of Mr Hudson, told the Authority that, on several occasions, he had discovered him asleep in a ceiling cavity on the third floor. Mr Khan said this constituted a safety hazard since it caused the ceiling to collapse inwards, affecting its structural integrity. He added that JSL was given an estimate of $37,000 (Â£18,500) to repair the ceiling - although it wasn't known whether Mr Hudson caused all the damage. JSL was ordered to pay Mr Hudson $1,795 (Â£900) in lost wages and compensation. Speaking for the Authority, Kenneth Anderson said that because JSL never told Mr Hudson of their concerns or indicated that his job was at risk, Mr Hudson's dismissal was 'procedurally and possibly substantively unjustified'. Mr Anderson said: 'Mr Hudson has been shown to be a person that was difficult to keep on the job and he was in the habit of hiding away, quite regularly it seems to avoid having to carry out some of the duties he was employed for."" An $8,000 (Â£4,000) compensation claim made by Mr Hudson was also rejected.","Francis Hudson worked at Japanese Spares Ltd in New Zealand .

A large group of Jewish high school students have been kicked off a flight after some refused to turn off their cell phones for take-off. The school party of 101 students and eight chaperones were removed from an AirTran flight on its way to Atlanta, Georgia from New York City on Monday at 6am. Some have claimed that the airline overreacted to the senior students' actions with one saying that they were targeted for being Jewish. Come fly with me: These are some of the 100 students after they were kicked off a flight on Monday for refusing to put away their phones. This picture shows the group as they boarded their second flight on Tuesday . Kicked off: 100 Jewish students were asked to leave an AirTran flight headed for Atlanta from New York on Monday . The disruptive scenes were on board an AirTran flight, owned by SouthWest Airlines. SouthWest Airlines confirmed to MailOnline that 137 were on board the flight at the time when 109 passengers were asked to leave. Teachers, who were with the group from the Yeshiva of Flatbush in Brooklyn, claimed that airline crew had over-reacted. The chaperones were also removed from the flight. Immediately after being taken off, one student tweeted: 'BIG SCANDAL!' to several news outlets. Many of the Twitter and Facebook posts have now been removed and accounts locked. One student later told CNN: 'They treated us like we were terrorists; I’ve never seen anything like it. I’m not someone to make these kinds of statements. ''I think if it was a group of non-religious kids, the air stewardess wouldn’t have dared to kick them off.' Criticism: Rabbi Joseph Beyda (left) said the stewardess had over-reacted on the flight while the school's director Rabbi Seth Linfield (right) said the school was investigating the airline's actions . MailOnline was awaiting a comment from SouthWest Airlines on this allegation. His teacher and chaperone Rabbi Joseph Beyda said the flight attendant was flustered and just told them to get off the plane. However another passenger Brad Rinschler, who was sitting in business class, told CNN he did not see any anti-Semitic behavior. Mr Rinschler, who takes the commuter flight three times a month, added: 'There was not one . ethnic slur from anyone on the flight crew or anyone who was . inconvenienced for two hours.' He said the students were given several chances to comply with the airline regulations - and even ignored a warning from the pilot over the intercom. In a statement to MailOnline, SouthWest Airlines said: . 'Our crew, responsible for the overall safety of AirTran flight 345 from . New York LaGuardia to Atlanta... had a group of non-compliant . passengers leave the aircraft before departing the gate. Delayed: The students all attend the Yeshiva of Flatbush in Brooklyn, New York . 'Reports from flight attendants and . other customers confirm some passengers in the group would not sit down . in their seats and some were using their mobile devices. 'Both are violations of Federal Air . Regulations, as well as our policies. The crew, led by the Captain, . asked several times that the passengers comply with regulations. 'The . issue ultimately delayed the flight’s departure to Atlanta. All members . of the group were accommodated on other flights this morning.' But school officials had a different account. Rabbi Seth Linfield, executive director at Yeshiva of Flatbush, said the school was still investigating but the adults on the trip said the students weren't behaving that badly. 'Preliminarily, it does not appear that the action taken by the flight crew was justified,' he said in a statement. He said the school had taken similar sized groups in the past without incident, NBC News said. One of the chaperones on the flight,  Marian Wielgus, said the airlines 'blew it out of proportion.' 'It was a mountain out of a molehill,' said Wielgus. She said some students may have had to be told twice to sit down or turn off their phones, but everyone listened, CNN said. 'They certainly did not do what the stewardess was claiming they did,' she said. 'That's what was so bizarre.' She called the flight attendants 'nasty' 'overreacting' and 'created an incident when there didn't have to be one.' The airline ultimately put the students on other flights, but it took 12 hours for some to reach their destination via transfers that took them as far out of their way as Milwaukee, Wis. The class trip to Atlanta involved activities including whitewater-rafting and a day out to Six Flags. Several comments were posted on the school's Facebook page in a backlash to the students and teachers' complaints. Sarah Anderson wrote: 'Seriously, a ''scandal'' your students say? Pff, a bunch of spoiled kids . who have no respect for anyone it seems. Good riddance from the plane . and poor pilot who had to fly them later.' Another Wilma Wilcox commented: 'AirTran did the right thing. These kids owe the flight crew and other passengers an apology!!'","Senior students removed from flight on Monday from NYC to Atlanta .

A collection of the world's worst waxworks has been sold to a mystery buyer from the Czech Republic. The anonymous purchaser is now the proud owner of more than 150 mis-shapen models of celebrities which once lived in the Louis Tussauds House of Wax museum in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. The figures - which represent both megastars such as David Beckham and minor celebrities like Eddie 'the Eagle' Edwards - cost £1,000 each to make. Sold: Mis-shapen waxworks depicting figures such as the Queen and Prince Charles have been bought by a foreign collector after years on show in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk . Closed: Louis Tussauds House of Wax shut down in 2012 after years as a cult tourist destination . Obscure: It is not known whether or not the Czech public are fans of Eddie 'the Eagle' Edwards, left, or Samantha Fox, right . Royals: Members of the Royal Family, such as Princess Diana and Prince William, are among the collection . It is not known exactly how much they were bought for, but it is thought that they were worth up to £12,000 based on previous auction estimates. The museum, run by Jane Hayes, 83, and her 86-year-old husband Peter Hayes, became a cult destination thanks to its bizarre exhibits but closed down in 2012 when the owner became ill. After selling the waxworks to an unidentified Czech collector, the couple have now put the Victorian building on the market for £375,000. They ran the museum together for 58 years, and lived a flat above but now plan to move out. A neighbour said: 'I heard that they . were all snapped up in one big job lot - possibly for another museum or a . tourist attraction. Icons? Cliff Richard and Paul McCartney as they appeared at Louis Tussauds . Icons: Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan were depicted in creepy guises in the museum . Miscellaneous: Sir Ian Botham and the Duke of Edinburgh both received tributes in the museum . TV: Comedians Rowan Atkinson, left, and Michael Barrymore, right, have apparently gone to Eastern Europe . 'All the models will need a bit of a makeover because most of them are very old. Maybe they will be recycled to become personalities in the Czech Republic!' The waxworks were scheduled to go up for auction in 2008, with a guide price of £50 to £80 - giving the 150 items a total estimated value of £7,500 to £12,000. The former museum, built in the mid-19th century as a doctor's house, is now up for sale with Howards Estate Agents. A listing on the firm's website states: 'The property comprises a substantial building - 608sq/m - which was until recently used as a waxworks museum. 'The property also includes owner's private living accommodation, a pair of kiosks to the front which provide additional income and an enclosed rear yard area with parking beyond.' Football heroes: Michael Owen and Paul Gascoigne can just about be recognised in these waxwork models . Unrecognisable: This pair of waxworks is supposed to represent Victoria and David Beckham . Dated: The collection prominently featured figures from the 80s and 90s like Frank Bruno and Jim Davidson . Band: The Beatles are just about recognisable as being Paul, John, George and Ringo . Musicians: Michael Jackson and Boy George were among the many pop stars in the museum . An answerphone message at the House of Wax says: 'Thank you for calling. Louis Tussauds House of Wax is now permanently closed.' Local councillor Michael Jeal, cabinet member for tourism, said he was sad about the loss of the cult museum and its potential conversion into a home. 'Any loss of tourist attractions is a blow,' he said. 'We don't want to be losing attractions near the seafront or anywhere in these times of austerity.' Mr and Mrs Hayes were granted planning permission to turn the museum into a home in December 2012. They said they had been hit by rising costs and reduced income, and had been unable to find a replacement for their wax modeller after he retired several years ago. Brits: Figures such as Steve Davis, left, and Neil Kinnock, right, may receive a bemused reaction from Czechs . Out of business: The building is now on the market for £375,000 and may be converted into a house . Dictators: Despots such as Hitler and Mussolini were given an inexplicable bronze glow . Showbiz: Light-entertainment icons Terry Wogan and Noel Edmonds were supposedly represented too . Guess who? This waxwork was supposed to represent Sarah, Duchess of York . The museum was named after the great grandson of Madame Tussaud, founder of the iconic waxworks museum in London in 1835. Mr Hayes admitted in 2008 that some of his models were no longer recognisable. He said: 'Some of them are too old and they do not resemble their subjects any more and obviously some visitors are far too young to remember them.' In Yarmouth’s heyday in the 1960s, visitors had to queue to get in and went round the exhibition in lines of up to four abreast, he added.","More than 150 terrible waxworks have entertained visitors to Louis Tussauds House of Wax in Great Yarmouth for six decades .

From Chinese characters that mean nothing to misspelt Hindi proverbs, getting a tattoo in a foreign language can leave you with more than you bargained for. But for 19-year-old cleaner Millie, getting a tattoo in English came with problems of its own after her tattooist managed to spell 'female' wrong - and did it despite having the correct spelling in front of him. Millie's tattoo, which was inspired . by an inking belonging to former X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos, . should have read: 'The Female Boss'. But thanks to her inept tattooist, Millie was left with one that said 'The Feamale Boss' instead. Oh dear: 19-year-old Millie's tattoo should have read 'The Female Boss'. Instead 'female' came with an extra 'a' 'I was mortified,' says Millie of her embarrassing tattoo. 'When I was having it . done, I looked away because I was in so much pain. 'He told me he was . dyslexic and I spelled it right for him but he still spelt it wrong on my . arm!' Now the teenager, who will appear on tonight's episode of TLC documentary Extreme Beauty Disasters has been forced to seek professional help to get rid of her embarrassing etching. Speaking to TLC skin expert and dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting, Millie reveals she had doubts about the tattoo from the start. 'My friend said to me, ""are you sure female has an 'a' in it?',"" she explains of the day she got the inking 'and I said yes, because it has. I thought she meant second ""a"" but she didn't.' Original: Millie was inspired by N-Dubz singer Tulisa Contostavlos' correctly spelt The Female Boss artwork . Not happy: Millie says she was left mortified by the tattoo and in need of drastic treatment to get rid of it . Improvement: Millie was forced to conceal the offending etching with an inking of a quill . Embarrassed, Millie tried to blame the problem on the N-Dubz singer, telling her horrified mother Tracey that her tattoo was spelled the same way as Tulisa's. But eventually, she revealed the truth - much to her mother's amusement. 'My mum was a bit gobsmacked at first but . then she thought it was funny because things like that just happen to . me,' says Millie. 'Basically, it's my own fault, isn't it. But I don't want it to stay . on my arm forever.' Given a choice between having the tattoo removed with lasers or concealing it with another, Millie is plumps for the latter after being told that removal means giving up her beloved sunbed sessions. 'Ultimately, the new tattoo looks much better and the spelling mistake is history,' sighs Dr Bunting, who had tried to persuade the teen to opt for laser treatment. 'If she's happy, then I'm happy.' And what does Millie think of her new quill shaped tattoo? 'I think he's done a pretty good job!' she chirps. Will she be getting another etching? Despite her experience, the teen admits she plans to - much to the consternation of her mother, Tracey. This time around though, an inking involving letters seems unlikely.

A woman mauled by a bear in central Florida earlier this month has spoken out publicly about the attack for the first time, telling state wildlife officials she thought she might die. 'That bear was trying to kill me, it just kept coming,' said Susan Chalfant, who suffered injuries to her face and head during the December 2 incident in her secluded neighborhood in Seminole County. Chalfant, 54, has declined media requests for interviews after surviving what officials have described as the worst reported bear attack on a human in Florida history. 'That bear was trying to kill me': Susan Chalfant (right) was the victim of the worst bear attack in Florida history last month and is now speaking out about the horrific mauling . In the report released on Tuesday by . the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Chalfant told . investigators she said she had just stepped out of her house for an . evening stroll with her two dogs when a black bear charged at her from . bushes nearby. The . 'snarling and growling' beast stopped short of her location but . 'continued to lunge forward and then back away over and over,' the . report said. As . Chalfant backed away, hoping to retreat to her home, the bear circled . her and cut off her escape route and knocked her to the ground, the . report added. She got up but the bear pushed her down again, it added. Chalfant . said she fought back with her fists as the bear started biting her in . the face and shaking her, trying to hit it and gouge the animal's eyes . out. But she sustained multiple injuries before managing to get up and . rush to a neighbor's house for help. 'Deep, ragged lacerations': Black bears like this one have become increasingly common in Florida. However, attacks--especially those like Chalfant's, which left her badly injured--are extremely rare (file photo) The . extent of Chalfant's injuries was unclear, since she declined to be . photographed or release any records kept by her medical providers, . according to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. A . commission investigator who saw Chalfant, before and after surgery, . said he observed 'deep, ragged lacerations on the face and head that . appeared consistent with wounds inflicted by an animal's teeth.' The . commission's report said investigators had concluded that Chalfant did . nothing intentional to provoke the adult female bear that lunged at her. The animal, which was captured and later identified through DNA tests . as the attacker, may be a 'highly protective' mother who saw Chalfant as . a threat to her three cubs. Dangerous: Experts believe the bear was protecting its cubs when it attacked Chalfant, who was out walking her dogs (file photo) Karen Parker, a wildlife commission spokeswoman, said the bear that mauled Chalfant was being held in a non-public area of Busch Gardens in Tampa with two of her cubs. 'In the springtime the plan is the two cubs will be released and she will be held in captivity for the rest of her life,' Parker said. Complaints about Florida black bears have jumped in the last decade, as urban and suburban sprawl brought more people into former wilderness areas where housing developments fractured areas well suited for bear habitat. In addition to Chalfant, only 15 Floridians have been injured by bears since the first reported incident in 2006, however, and Parker said those injuries were all minor. 'This is the worst reported attack on a person in the state's history,' Parker said.","Susan Chalfant, 54, endured 'deep, ragged lacerations on the face and head that appeared consistent with wounds inflicted by an animal's teeth'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:41 EST, 15 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:41 EST, 15 June 2013 . Queen Victoria's relationship with her devoted ghillie John Brown 150 years ago set tongues wagging from the grand hallways of Buckingham Palace to the servants’ quarters at Balmoral. But while rumours that the pair were lovers endure to this day, a new book claims there was another reason why the pair were so close. According to author J. H. Brennan, Brown was a medium channelling the spirit of the Queen’s beloved late husband, Prince Albert. Decades apart: Prince Albert died in 1861 aged 42. Queen Victoria died in 1901 at the age of 81. She is said to have tried to contact her husband through a medium after his death . Brennan, whose book Whisperers examines the impact of spirit contact on the rich and powerful, said: ‘Queen Victoria was fascinated by spiritualism long before Albert’s early death at the age of 42 in 1861. Mediums would visit Buckingham Palace and hold seances.’ As Brown passed messages to and from the deceased Prince Consort, he grew increasingly close to the bereaved Queen. ‘I don’t believe they were lovers, but Victoria had a great affection for Brown,’ said Brennan. ‘People gossiped at the inappropriate . intimacy, but it wasn’t a sexual relationship. When Brown died in 1883, . almost two decades before Victoria, she described him as her only true . friend.’ The ghillie is best remembered today thanks to the acclaimed 1997 film Mrs Brown, starring Dame Judi Dench and Billy Connolly.

"By . Ted Thornhill . PUBLISHED: . 03:29 EST, 6 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:39 EST, 6 December 2013 . Most people know the handful of rules that govern using the London Underground – such as letting passengers off the train first and not prizing the doors open when the train is trying to set off. These orders are barked out by station staff through a loudspeaker system. Parisians also have rules for their underground system. However, these have been distributed with a little more sophistication – via an online ‘politeness’ manual released by the Paris transport authority to ensure civility prevails at all times. Rules: Paris has released an etiquette guide for using the Metro system . Called the ‘Manuel du savoir-vivre à l’usage du voyageur moderne’ – or ‘politeness manual for the modern traveller’ - it lists 12 ‘commandments’ for Parisians to abide by and comes complete with quaint sketches to illustrate the points. The online guide, which was drawn up using suggestions from the public, is split into four categories – ‘helpfulness’, ‘courtesy’, ‘manners’ and ‘politeness’. The rules insist that Parisians must offer help to tourists ‘in Bermuda shirts with a metro map in one hand and the other hand in their hair’, hold the door open for passengers behind them – and greet the driver. Take note: The guide advises travellers not to play music loudly on the Metro . Travellers should also understand, the guide states, that ‘the huge crossed out cigarette on the platform is not a work of art but a ban on smoking’. The guide is also as mischievous as it is sarcastic. ‘It's worth losing two minutes of your time for a good cause if only to hear the [foreign] passenger struggle to pronounce [the metro stops] 'Trinité d'Estienne d'Orves' or 'La Motte Piquet-Grenelle', it says. Watch out: Staring at beautiful women is rude, the online Metro guide says . The key no-nos are not playing music too loudly through headphones, resisting the temptation to stare for a long time at beautiful women and holding back from starting a fight with someone who’s just stepped on your toes. Loud phone conversations should also be avoided, old lady’s bags should be carried up stairs, armpits should be covered by arms and not exposed to the carriage – and handkerchiefs not just used to wave someone off with, but to sneeze into. Last but not least – the Metro is not to be mistaken for a lavatory. It's the pits: Arms should be kept by your side at all times on the Paris Metro .","The rules were drawn up using suggestions from the Paris public .
