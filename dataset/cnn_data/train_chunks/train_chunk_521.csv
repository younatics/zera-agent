The angry father of Justin Lee Collins' ex-girlfriend said he hoped the disgraced comedian would be 'scrubbing toilets' following his conviction for harrassing her. Just 24 hours after a jury convicted the long-haired, bearded performer of harassing recovering alcoholic Anna Larke, her father Jerry joined domestic violence . charities in claiming the sentence was 'not hard enough'. Speaking to the Evening Standard, he added: 'I . would like to see him scrubbing toilets for the abuse he did to my . daughter.' Fury: The angry father of Anna Larke, left, the ex-girlfriend of Justin Lee Collins, right,  said he hoped the disgraced comedian would be 'scrubbing toilets' following his conviction for harrassing her . Mr Larke's comments came after Mr Collins today refused to accept that he violently abused Ms Larke - but ruled out a legal appeal. Collins, 38, issued a . statement saying he would 'never accept the allegation that I am violent . or an abuser'. The television presenter was found guilty of abusing his ex-girlfriend during a stormy . nine-month relationship last year. It followed a  ten-day trial which ended . yesterday. The former star of Channel 4’s Friday Night Project was ordered to carry . out 140 hours unpaid work as part of an 18-month community order. Ms Larke, a recovering alcoholic, claimed Collins humiliated and . controlled her, including forcing her to detail her sexual past in a . notepad. The jury also heard . that during their relationship last year the entertainer . made Ms Larke sleep facing him, and assaulted her. Convicted: The television presenter was found guilty of abusing his ex-girlfriend during a stormy nine-month relationship last year. It followed a ten-day trial which ended at St Albans Crown Court, pictured, yesterday . Mr Larke, 67, of Welwyn Garden City, said he was initially charmed by . Collins and only found about his behaviour toward his daughter when she . went to the police. He said: 'If I were to see Collins I would ask him one question - why? He has two beautiful little children, I have seen photographs of them. 'He is a very strange man, there is something wrong with him. In some . respects I feel sorry for him, though that may be hard to believe. I . think maybe something happened in his childhood, but it is difficult to . say. 'She is a changed girl now, she has no confidence. Emotionally she is . depressed. They kept on about her being a severe alcoholic, but she . never had a drop of drink when she was with Collins. 'I think it will be a difficult job for her to recover, it will be very . difficult. She was absolutely besotted with him. She is completely . deflated now, there is no go in her at all.' The court was told Collins even abused Ms Larke’s pet cat Jak, and her . father said the family were distressed by an incident where Collins . apparently left the animal with severe head injuries after putting him . in a suitcase and swinging it around. He said: 'He put the cat into a suitcase and swung it round in the air, the cat’s head was smashed. 'It had a terrible wound on the side of his head. Anna was very upset . about it. The cat now is very strange, it is not the cat it used to be.' Victim: Ms Larke, pictured, a recovering alcoholic, claimed Collins humiliated and controlled her, including forcing her to detail her sexual past in a notepad . After Collins was convicted he was photographed laughing, which he said today did not reflect how he really felt. He said: 'The pictures that have been released of me laughing are in no way a reflection of my current mood. 'I . deeply regret the distress and anguish I have caused by my behaviour in . what was a very troubled and difficult relationship with Anna Larke. 'After careful reflection in the last 24 hours I have decided not to proceed with an appeal against my conviction. 'I . would like to re-iterate what I made clear in court, that I have never . used or threatened violence against Anna Larke or anybody in my life. 'I . accept that the jury have found elements of my conduct amounted to . harassment which I apologise for unreservedly, but I will never accept . the allegation that I am violent or an abuser.' Collins . insisted he only ever gently slapped Ms Larke twice - when she was . hysterical and relapsing into alcoholism. And he told the court she was . jealous, obsessive and possessive. Regret: After Collins was convicted he was photographed laughing, which he said today did not reflect how he really felt . The trial at St Albans Crown Court heard Collins, who met Ms Larke while . he was still married, frequently grabbed her hair, slapped her, made . sexually derogatory comments about her and deprived her of sleep. He even made her throw away DVDs because they featured actors she found . attractive, she said, and on one occasion on a drunken night out with . fellow comic Alan Carr, he pushed her in front of a taxi. After deliberating for nearly 12 hours over three days, the jury agreed . by a 10-1 majority that he had subjected her to months of harassment and . abuse after they moved in together in January last year. Sentencing Collins and ordering him to pay £3,500 costs, Judge John . Plumstead told him his community service should be 'humbling work' for . someone with such a prominent career in showbusiness. He said: 'This is not a run-of-the-mill case of domestic violence, as I . see it. What happened between you and Miss Larke was genuinely out of . character. 'You became increasingly unable to deal with the difficulties in your . relationship and on more than one occasion you lost your self-control . and acted in a violent way.' Collins, of Kew,, had denied the charge of harassment by causing fear of . violence. He claimed Ms Larke, 38, was obsessive, jealous and described . the relationship as 'absolute hell'. Her brother Alex, 33, a musician, said he hoped Collins would get help . after being convicted, adding: 'I don’t wish that his career is damaged . or anything like that. He has been through a lot but it is his own . doing. 'There was an opportunity for him to say ""I have done this and now I want to get help"" and people would have had more sympathy.' Domestic violence charities hit out at the sentence. Sandra Horley, . chief executive of Refuge, said: 'Until the courts give sentences that . fit the crime, men like Justin Lee Collins will get away with campaigns . of terror and thousands of women, like Anna, will continue to be at . risk.' Vivienne Hayes, chief executive of the Women’s Resource Centre, said: 'The problem with such a light sentence is that it sends out a message . to both men and women that domestic violence is not that serious, when . in reality we know that its impacts are devastating.' But Collins’s wife Karen, who is divorcing the presenter and gave . evidence saying he was ""gentle, kind and generous"", defended him after . the sentence. Speaking from her home in Bristol yesterday, she told the Daily Mail the . guilty verdict was 'ridiculous’. She said: 'At the moment my priority . is the children. But I can say that I think the verdict is ridiculous. I . don’t believe it even for one second.'","Jerry Larke joined domestic violence .

A Florida woman said she was humiliated by local police as she accused them of hogtying her, parading her around topless and bashing some of her teeth out during her arrest last year. Ashleigh Davis, of Ocala, Florida, said she found herself on the wrong side of the law in April of last year at the Leesburg Bikefest after she and another woman were having an argument. When police asked her to leave, she reportedly refused, and was bound by her hands and feet by officers from the Leesburg Police Department and Lake County Sheriff’s Office. Humiliation: Ashleigh Davis can be seen laying topless in the middle of a holding cell, surrounded by several male officers . Damage: Davis said her teeth were cracked after one of the officers slammed her head into the floor . Speaking out: Davis says she deserved to be arrested, but not the brutality she claims to have suffered . The 32-year-old said that while she was being detained, her bikini top fell off, and officers whisked her away topless in front of onlookers. Davis told the Palm Beach Post: '[Officers] handcuffed my hands to my feet and then took a tie and tied it around, then carried me like a suitcase and threw me on the back of a golf cart.' Busted: Davis was given a green sweater for her booking photo . She told the paper that she suffered further shame at the Leesburg Police Department, as she laid nearly naked on the floor of the police station holding cell while a group of officers laughed at her. Davis said that the abuse didn’t stop there, as one of them allegedly smacked her face against the floor and chipped some of her teeth after she had bitten him. She told the Post: 'I just remember him grabbing me from behind, my hair and [covered my mouth] and then I try to bite, and then they grabbed me by the back of my head and slammed my face down.' She admits that she probably deserved to be arrested, but that the officers she dealt with were way over the line. Davis was charged with two counts of aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest with violence and disorderly intoxication, and is serving probation in the case. She claimed that she had filed a complaint against the officer, days after her arrest. Her attorney, Stan Plappert, told WESH.com: 'I think they should have sensitivity training. You would think that they would know that, ""hey, I have a topless woman or a nearly naked person. I need to do something to cover them up, to give them some dignity.""' Davis added: 'I don't want this to happen again. I want people to be treated the way we’re supposed to be treated, and yes, I'm paying for what I did, and I want them to pay for what has happened to me.'

A plane intercepted on its way from Moscow to Damascus was carrying military equipment and ammunition to Syria, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said today. Erdogan says the cargo seized by Turkish authorities late Wednesday was destined for the Syrian military. He told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was still examining the equipment and that 'the necessary will follow.' Syria has denied that the Syrian Air Airbus A320 was carrying an illicit cargo. Under suspicion: A Syrian passenger plane believed to be carrying military equipment is searched by Turkish officials after being forced to land by fighter jets . 'Air piracy': Passengers and investigators gather at the entrance of the jet, which was forced to land at Ankara airport late on Wednesday . Moscow has accused Ankara of endangering Russian lives after Turkey . scrambled fighter planes to force the Syrian passenger jet to land and . seized what it suspected was military equipment being ferried President . Bashar al-Assad's forces. The . interception of the Syrian Air plane came hours after Turkey's chief of . staff warned that his troops would respond with greater force if shells . from Syria continued to hit Turkish territory. Military . jets escorted the Damascus-bound Airbus A-320, which was carrying . around 30 passengers from Moscow, into Ankara airport late on Wednesday . after Turkey received intelligence that it was carrying military . supplies. The plane and its passengers were allowed to continue after parts of the cargo were seized. Officials gave no details of what was confiscated, saying investigations were underway, but some Turkish newspapers said the cargo included non-lethal supplies such as radio equipment. Ghaida Abdulatif, head of Syrian Arab Airlines, said: The plane was not carrying any illegal material. 'When the plane was inspected it was clear that there were ... civilian packages with electrical equipment which are allowed to be . transported and had been officially registered.' Tensions rise: Officials gave no details of what was confiscated, but some Turkish newspapers said the cargo included non-lethal supplies such as radio equipment . Diplomatic row: Turkey's Foreign Minister said his country was within its rights to investigate planes suspected of carrying military materials . Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet . Davutoglu said: 'We are determined to control weapons transfers to a . regime that carries out such brutal massacres against civilians. It is . unacceptable that such a transfer is made using our airspace. 'Today . we received information this plane was carrying cargo of a nature that . could not possibly be in compliance with the rules of civil aviation,' he added in Athens during an official visit in comments broadcast live . on Turkish television. Davutoglu . said Turkey was within its rights to investigate planes suspected of . carrying military materials but declined to say what was in the cargo. Turkey would continue to investigate Syrian civilian aircraft using its airspace, he said. 'Unacceptable': Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu saysb he determined to control transfers of weapons to a regime which carries out 'brutal massacres' Syria's transport minister has accused Turkey on Thursday of 'air piracy', according to Lebanon's al-Manar Television. The channel quoted minister Mahoumd Said as saying the move 'contradicts civil aviation treaties'. Turkish authorities have also instructed Turkish passenger planes not to fly in Syrian airspace, saying it was no longer safe. A . witness at the border saw at least one passenger plane turn around as . it approached Syria and head back into Turkey on Wednesday. Russia, which has stood behind Assad's government during an 18-month-old uprising that has killed some 30,000 people, has . demanded an explanation from Turkish authorities for the interception . of the plane, Interfax cited a Russia Foreign Ministry source as saying. 'The lives and safety of the passengers were placed under threat', the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement, adding that 17 of its nationals on board were refused access to Russian diplomatic staff. A source in a Russian arms exporting . agency told Interfax that no Russian 'weapons nor any kind of systems or . parts for military equipment' were on board the aircraft. 'If we needed to send any kind of military-technical equipment or arms it would have been carried out properly and not through any illegal means, certainly not on a civilian aircraft,' the source said. Rebels are outgunned by the government but can still strike at will, and President Bashar al-Assad has assumed personal command of his forces, convinced he can prevail militarily. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 70 people had been killed across Syria on Wednesday, including six rebels in the strategic town of Maarat al-Nuaman, on the north-south highway linking Aleppo to the capital Damascus. Fleeing the violence: A Syrian family crosses the Orontes river to Turkey near the village of Hacipasa in Hatay province as fighting intensifies on the border . Refugee: A wounded Syrian man is carried to an ambulance after crossing to Turkey over the Orontes river on the Turkish-Syrian border . Meanwhile, the conflict threatens to . spill over Syria's borders and ignite a wider Middle Eastern war, . drawing in neighbouring states and pitting Sunni Muslim states against . Syria's rulers and their allies including Shi'ite Iran. Russia, from where the Syrian plane took off, has blocked tougher U.N. resolutions against Damascus. 'Once . a week a Syrian Airlines airplane flies from Moscow bound for . Damascus,' Interfax reported Vnukovo Airport spokeswoman Yelena Krylova . as saying. 'The plane took off normally, there were no incidents.' Interfax . cited her as saying 25 people were on board the chartered plane and it . left 20 minutes after its scheduled afternoon departure time. Turkey's armed forces have bolstered . their presence along the 900km (560-mile) border and have been firing . back over the past week in response to gunfire and shelling coming . across from northern Syria, where Assad's forces have been battling . rebels who control swathes of territory. No end in sight: Smoke rises from a building as shelling continues in Damascus yesterday, when around 70 people were killed in fighting across Syria . War on the border: Tensions escalated last week when mortars fired from inside Syria killed five civilians in the village Akcakale, Turkey (above) 'We . responded but if it continues we will respond with greater force,' state television TRT quoted Turkey's Chief of Staff, General Necdet . Ozel, as saying. Several . mortar bombs landed outside the Syrian border town of Azmarin and heavy . machine gun fire could be heard on Wednesday as clashes between the . Syrian army and rebels intensified. Scores of civilians, many of them women with screaming children clinging to their necks, crossed a narrow river marking the border with Turkey as they fled the fighting. The news comes after the UN reported that 335,000 Syrian refugees have . registered with the organisation, an increase by ten times since March. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Tuesday the military alliance had plans in place to defend Turkey. It is not clear whether the shells that have hit Turkish territory were aimed to strike there or were due to Syrian troops overshooting as they attacked rebel positions.

Furious Walmart workers are threatening to strike on the busiest shopping day of the year - Black Friday. The walkout, scheduled for next month on the day after Thanksgiving, is set to cause chaos across Dallas, San Diego, Chicago and Los Angeles. Today, a meeting at Walmart's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas was interrupted by 200 protesters waving placards and chanting. Loud and proud: Workers picket a Walmart in Dallas this week claiming the firm is using unfair labour practices and 'punishing' troublemakers . Walmart is the world's largest private . employer and has long been a target of workers' rights groups, who . advocate higher wages, more flexibility in hours and an end to punishments, such as reduced shifts, which they claim are meted out to staff seeking to unionise. Evelin Cruz, a department manager, told ABC News that for many years she kept . quiet about what she views as the company's unjust practices . because she was afraid of being fired if she spoke out. Ms Cruz, who works at the Pico Rivera Walmart in California, is one of thousands of members of Our . Walmart, an organisation backed by the United Food and Commercial . Workers. Leaders of Our Walmart, the National . Consumers League and other groups today said they will join Walmart . workers outside stores on Black Friday if their demands are not met. National Organization of Women president Terry O'Neill said her group would join in the action on Black Friday, to show 'solidarity with the workers who are walking off the job'. Driven to action: The roving picket line hit at least three Walmarts around Dallas, travelling in a charter bus, private vehicles and the Our Walmart mobile . Last Thursday, about 30 employees from the Pico Rivera Walmart demonstrated outside the store with signs that read 'Stand Up, Live Better, Stop Retaliation' and 'Stop Trying to Silence Us'. The protest over working conditions was coordinated with actions at eight other Walmart stores across California protesting against working conditions and treatment. It was the first-ever walkout in the company's 50-year history, said Dawn Le, a spokeswoman for Making Change at Walmart, a coalition whose mission is to change the way the firm conducts business. 'Everyone else has a union,' said Ms Le. 'Workers in every other country — Japan, the U.K., Nicaragua, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina — have been able to form a union, except the U.S. and Canada. 'We just don't understand the double standard Walmart has. How come those in other countries get to have a voice, yet not in the U.S., its home country?' Unionising: The strike action was organised by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union and Our Walmart . Walmart spokesman Dan Fogleman disputed her claims, insisting that most employees have 'repeatedly rejected unionisation. 'They seem to recognise that Walmart has some of the best jobs in the retail industry — good pay, affordable benefits and the chance for advancement,' he said. Walmart has hit the headlines on several recent occasions. In mid-September, warehouse workers in Southern California went on a 15-day strike that included a six-day, 50-mile pilgrimage for safe jobs. Around the same time, hundreds of people marched in Dallas and San Diego, demanding better work conditions. On Monday, Chicago riot police arrested 17 peaceful protesters blocking the entrance to a warehouse that supplies Walmart stores in support of striking workers. The company is also now facing another sex discrimination lawsuit, filed on behalf of 100,000 women in California and Tennessee. Power to the people: The walkout next month could cause chaos for the huge employer across Dallas, San Diego, Chicago and Los Angeles . Dan Schlademan, director of Making Change at Walmart, said: 'Workers find how Walmart has tried to retaliate by cutting their hours and not scheduling them for certain shifts when they tried to speak out, and they're tired of it.' The $16billion company, however, argues that the California rally was simply a 'publicity stunt by the UFCW to seek media attention in order to further their political agenda and financial objectives', according to Mr Schlademan. Ms Cruz, who started on $7.40 an hour and now makes $13.20, said: 'We just wanted to be treated like humans, not robots. We do have health insurance, but in most cases, you're not even making enough to live on, let alone take anyone to the hospital.' Although she worries about losing her job, she didn't see another option but to voice her anger. 'We are still worried that they might retaliate,' she added. 'We know exactly how they operate. They wait until you feel confident, or put down your guard, and then they come after you one way or another. But that's how tired we are of what's going on in the stores.'","Mass walkout will come the day after Thanksgiving .

Four men have been handed a new injunction dubbed the 'Gang-bo' barring them from stepping on to the 'turf' of a rival gang after six underworld shootings in just three weeks. Jacob Harrison and Leevon Birchall, both 19, Kane Stafford, 21, and 22-year old Carne Thomasson, were handed the anti-gang injunctions stopping them from entering parts of Salford, Greater Manchester, following a feud. The men also cannot communicate with each other and named associates that police say are involved in organised crime. The injunctions are not criminal convictions but civil orders and anyone caught breaching the injunction faces up to two years in prison. Orders: Kane Stafford, 21, left, and Jacob Harrison, 19, right, have been handed injunctions stopping them from entering their rivals 'turf' in Salford, Greater Manchester after six underworld shootings in three weeks . The turf war broke out last month following a petty dispute between the two gangs which is thought to have arisen out of a minor 'respect' argument. In the first incident on September 9, the window of a car was shot at. The following day police were called to a suburban street after reports of gunfire. On September 13 armed police were called to more reports of gunshots and on September 25, shots were fired at the front door and through the window of two houses in separate shootings. Later two men, aged 19 and 22, were arrested in connection with another shooting, which saw shots fired at the glass-panelled front door at teatime on September 27. Both men were freed on bail. One man, aged 18 was arrested and charged with possession of a firearm after officers recovered a loaded firearm. Gang: Leevon Birchall, 19, left, and Carne Thomasson, 22, right, are also subject to the orders. Armed patrols are now patrolling the streets of Salford and a number of 'threat to life' notices have been issued to people . No one has been injured in any of the shootings. However, armed patrols are now patrolling the streets of Salford and a number of ‘threat-to-life’ notices issued to people believed to be involved in the feud. Salford Council applied for the interim civil orders last month in an emergency court session. Officers told a judge at Manchester County Court that they needed to 'minimise the risk of further violence.' The orders will be in place for 12 months and will be reviewed next year. Harrison, Thomasson and Birchall are all forbidden from entering the Duchy or Ellesmere Park estates. Harrison and Birchall are also banned from venturing onto a road in Irlam’s o’th Height in Salford. Banned: The Duchy Estate in Salford which Harrison, Thomasson and Birchall are all forbidden from entering . Stafford, is forbidden from entering the City of Salford itself except by travelling on the M60 motorway without exiting or to attend pre-arranged medical or dental appointments and only with prior notice given to police. All four men are now under 9pm to 5am curfews with a door step condition to present themselves to a police officer on request. Don Brown, a retired Det Chief Supt, now assistant director for community safety at Salford council, said: 'This is the first time we have used these powers to minimise the risk of further gang-related violence in our communities. 'We work extremely closely with police to tackle those thought to be involved in serious organised crime and we have a variety of initiatives to help prevent young people from becoming involved in criminality. Strict: Stafford is forbidden from entering the . City of Salford (pictured) itself except by travelling on the M60 motorway without . exiting or to attend pre-arranged medical or dental appointments . 'To ensure our communities are as safe as possible we will continue to use all the powers available to us to disrupt criminals, their activities and ensure Salford is as safe as possible.' Chief Supt Kevin Mulligan of Greater Manchester Police said: 'I hope that these positive steps will encourage others to now speak to local police and partners and let us know who exactly is causing the problems within Salford.' He added: 'The answers to this dispute undoubtedly lie in the community and I would ask that if anyone does have information, that they come forward - in confidence if needed - so we can arrest those involved and take these firearms off the streets.' Police are now using the same tactics in Salford that helped drive down gun crime in neighbouring Moss Side by 80 per cent. The tactics - now used by other police forces up and down the UK - include detectives getting close to known criminals, and steering them away from trouble if possible. If they fail to behave, however, police come down hard. Known gang members are regularly stop-checked in the street and - if they have been arrested - officers make regular trips to their homes to make sure they stick to their curfews.","The turf war apparently broke out .

These fish - no longer than two inches long - have sparked a court case and emergency clear-up operation costing the taxpayer up to £205,000. The Environment Agency launched the action after they found topmouth gudgeon, an invasive Asian alien species, in a private fishery that feeds into a major river in Devon. Despite their tiny size, the fish could have wiped out the local eco-system by mass-breeding and out-competing native rivals for food. It is not clear how they entered the 40 acre Clawford . Lakes fishery near Holsworthy, Devon, although it is suspected an angler introduced them. Deadly killers: These tiny topmouth gudgeon fish measure up to just two inches but caused mass panic when they were found in a Devon lake . Such was the concern about the potential damage, Government officials spent five weeks mounting an operation to remove hundreds of native coarse fish like carp and eel from the fishery. After scooping them out one by one in nets, they held them in quarantine while the affected water was treated with a chemical that killed off the invasive minnows. These actions alone cost £170,000 of public money. Meanwhile the owners of the fishery, John and Wanda Ray, were prosecuted for . keeping non-native fish without permission under the Import of Live Fish . Act 1980. The couple were fined £4,950 and ordered to pay £30,000 costs. The site flows into the River Claw which is a tributory to the River Tamar, that is rich in salmon, and its owners landed themselves in deep water after they advertised to anglers on their website that they were stocking a species of fish that turned out to also be illegal. Danger zone: Clawford Lakes, pictured, where the fish was found, had to have all other species pulled out of it and then chemicals added to kill the Asian species introduced by an angler . This prompted officials from the Environment Agency to pay and visit and they found no sign of the advertised fish - but did find thousands of topmouth gudgeon. The couple were given a period of time to remove the minnows but when agency staff returned to find nothing had been done, they took direct action themselves. Mike Dunning, a spokesman for the Environment Agency, said: 'We were alerted to the fishery because they advertised that they had rosy minnow in their lakes. They are an invasive species, so we went to investigate but didn’t actually find any of them. Instead, we found the topmouth gudgeon. 'The owners hadn’t put the fish in the water themselves, so they must have been carried in on an anglers equipment. 'We warned the owners that they had to find a way to treat the problem, but when we returned that hadn’t done anything about it. 'Then we decided to remove them. We scooped out each native fish in nets, and put them into a quarantined pond. 'Then we treated the water with a chemical that killed the topmouth gudgeon, and when the water naturally returned to normal, we introduced the fish back in to the lake.” Dozens of non-native catfish were also found at the site, which were removed and re-homed.","The topmouth gudgeon could have wiped out the local eco-system after they were found in a Devon lake with links to the River Tamar .

Britain's top financial regulator has admitted that his organisation let down the country by failing to stop the economic crisis. Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, described the years before the credit crunch as a ‘fool’s paradise’. Giving a speech at a banquet in the Mansion House in the City of London last night, he slammed the ‘dangerous’ culture that had been allowed to exist at major banks which meant they cared more about profits and bonuses than their customers. Admission: Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, described the years before the credit crunch as a 'fool's paradise' In a withering assessment of the FSA’s own failings, he admitted the regulator had allowed a set of ‘bad rules’ to remain in place and had shown ‘severe deficiencies’. And he said that ‘ordinary’ people were still paying the price for the economic crisis which began in August 2007. He said: ‘The crisis was not a bolt from the blue. ‘It arose from poor supervision, from bad rules and structures, from dangerous cultures – and the errors were made by regulators, economists, central bankers and public policy makers, as well as bankers themselves. ‘A lot of apparently very clever people got it very wrong, and the ordinary citizen suffered. We have to do better in future.’ Lord Turner, a frontrunner to replace Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England when he retires next June, became FSA chairman in September 2008. The American investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed, the emergency merger of HBOS and Lloyds had just been announced and the Icelandic banks were about to fail. He said the timing of his new job was like ‘being appointed captain of the Titanic after we’d hit the iceberg but before we’d actually sunk.’ Outgoing: Lord Turner is a frontrunner to replace Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England when he retires next June . He said between 1999 – the year that the FSA was set up – and 2007, regulators thought it was ‘plain sailing’ with no ‘icebergs’. Lord Turner admitted: ‘But that was a delusion, the vulnerabilities relentlessly growing, but we didn’t spot them. It was ‘a fool’s paradise – the band playing on oblivious to the dangers ahead.’ 'The crisis was not a bolt from the blue. It arose from poor supervision, from bad rules and structures, from dangerous cultures – and the errors were made by regulators, economists, central bankers and public policy makers, as well as bankers themselves' Lord Turner, Financial Services Authority chairman . He also admitted that he had been wrong when he called for Britain to join the euro in 2002. Critics say his mistake could prove a stumbling block to his chances of becoming the next Bank of England governor. He said: ‘Ten years ago, I argued in favour of the eurozone project and for Britain’s eventual membership. ‘As I have said before, I was wrong, failing to recognise the inherent flaws in the eurozone’s current design. And it is important for both individuals and institutions to recognise mistakes and learn from them.’ n Barclays has announced it is to pay staff bonuses based purely on the service they provide customers. The new structure, which will apply to 18,000 frontline staff in branches and call centres, will come into force in December. Chief executive Antony Jenkins said it is part of an urgent bid to win back the trust of its customers. The move comes after the FSA said secret commission paid to staff had created a rotten culture where customers are viewed only as ‘sales targets’. Lord Turner, once one of the most high-profile supporters of Britain joining the euro, admitted that he was wrong when he called for the pound to be ditched. He told his Mansion House audience that he regretted his earlier views and said he had ‘learned’ from his mistakes. Lord Turner – along with six others, including Liberal Democrat MP Chris Huhne – published a 40-page pamphlet in August 2002 entitled ‘Why Britain should join the euro’. It said: ‘At each stage the opponents of the euro have forecast disasters which have never happened and always looked unlikely.’ They then wrongly claimed it was important to join the euro in order to improve living standards in Britain. The pamphlet ended: ‘If once again we fail to join the European leaders, we risk falling further behind them. ‘There are of course pros and cons of joining the euro. We have tried to set them out fairly. ‘But we believe the arguments in favour are much the stronger. And the time to join will soon be upon us.’","FSA chairman Lord Turner called years before credit crunch 'fool's paradise'

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 10:47 EST, 11 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:31 EST, 11 October 2012 . Susan Wurtzel owns a Today show . T-shirt and a mug. When the stay-at-home mom and her family visited New . York from their home in Germantown, Maryland, they joined the crowd of fans . outside the NBC morning show's Rockefeller Center studio. Now, after more than 20 years as a regular Today viewer, Wurtzel tunes to CBS most mornings. Multiply such defections and you have . the chief reason for television's changing fortunes in morning news, . where ABC's Good Morning America has ended NBC's epic 17-year winning . streak on Today. ABC is growing — GMA has 110,000 more viewers each . day this year than last — but not as much as NBC is slipping, 437,000 . viewers a day since last year. Used to winning: The Today Show had been the morning show with the most viewers for the past 17 years before April of this year when GMA ruined their winning streak . The new dream team: ABC's Good Morning America are getting thousands more viewers than Today since Ann Curry was sacked . Wurtzel, 57, left last spring because of Today co-host Ann Curry. 'Ann's interview style was like chalk on . a board to me,' she said. 'She leaned toward her interviewee and . whispered her questions like someone had died. 'The more serious the . interview, the quieter she got. When she replaced Meredith Vieira, I . tried to adjust and accept, but she just didn't work for me. Katie Couric and Meredith were relatable, empathetic and funny. Ann just . seemed out of place.' Executives at NBC were quietly reaching the same conclusion and moved to replace Curry with Savannah Guthrie. Then came June 28, 2012, Curry's last . day as co-host. She cried in bewilderment at her perceived failure at . losing the job she had sought for years, as her uncomfortable co-workers . and a nation looked on. Suddenly, a problem for NBC became a BIG . problem. Even people who didn't particularly like Curry loathed the way . she was dispatched. Except for two weeks during the Olympics, Today . hasn't sniffed first place in the ratings since. Struggling: Curry cried in bewilderment at her perceived failure at losing the job she had sought for years, as her uncomfortable co-workers and a nation looked on . During the first six . months of 2012, Today averaged just under 5.2 million viewers each . weekday. Since July 2, the audience has dropped to 4.59 million, . according to Nielsen, the company that measures TV audiences. Without . the two weeks of the London Olympics, the average is 4.3 million. That's . a stunning drop, even accounting for typical lower viewership in the . summer. An informal survey of three dozen . viewers who have left or are considering leaving Today turned up . various explanations, including a feeling that the show had leaned too . far in the direction of lighter, pop culture fare. The Curry dismissal . was clearly a tipping point, however. William Runge, a manager at an . educational cable network who lives in suburban Winston-Salem, North Carolina, . likened the treatment of Curry to 'a public flogging'. 'The PR machine at NBC spent an enormous . amount of time and effort convincing me that the Today show team was . actually part of my family, ""America's First Family"", said Runge, 46, . citing the show's advertising slogan. In charge: Today executive producer Jim Bell, . center, is pictured with Meredith Vieira, Ann Curry, Matt Lauer, and . Bryant Gumbel earlier this year . Admitting fault: Matt Lauer spoke on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight saying that he didn't want to leave because he believes there is still work to be done to make the show stronger . 'Guess what? They were right. These did feel like family members. So this is how you are going to . treat a member of your family? 'You can debate for hours whether Ms . Curry was right for the role,' he said. 'That's not the point. She was . doing her job and was barely 11 months into it when they canned her in . the most humiliating way possible.' The move was 'heart-wrenching', said . Isabelle Langelier, a 40-year-old manager at a drug company from . Montreal. 'It made me feel sick for her. And it made me turn the . channel, probably permanently.' 'While I thought Ann Curry's interviews . were a little hokey at times, she is clearly the most genuine person in . TV news,' said Sarah Rosenthal, 53, a graduate student and mother of . three from West Chester, Pennsylvania. 'After her unceremonious dumping, I turned . it off. I have nothing against Savannah, and adore Natalie Morales, but . there is just a different tone to the show.' Even worse for NBC, a significant number . of viewers appear to blame co-host Matt Lauer for the move. The network . has consistently denied tabloid reports that Lauer was unhappy with . Curry. Today Executive Producer Jim Bell said late last month that . Lauer was being treated unfairly. Firing Curry was Bell's decision, he . said. Some awkward public moments haven't . helped. Worrying: ABC is growing — GMA has 110,000 more viewers each . day this year than last — but not as much as NBC is slipping, 437,000 . viewers a day since last year . The moment Lauer lost his likability? Curry's . unceremonious booting off the show has long been a thorn in Lauer's . side, after it was claimed he was responsible for getting her axed . When Curry reappeared on Today during the London Olympics to . introduce a story she had done, Lauer twice remarked that it was good to . see her again. Curry didn't return the sentiment to the man she worked . with for 15 years. Two years ago, Lauer's positive 'Q' score was 23 — meaning 23 per cent of people who knew him considered . Lauer one of their favorite broadcasters, according to Marketing . Evaluations Inc, a company that measures public sentiment toward . well-known personalities. Meet the new host: It has been reported that Willie Geist will join the Today show to to serve as co-host during the 9am hour . Now his positive score is 14. At the same . time, Good Morning America co-host Robin Roberts' positive 'Q' score . jumped from 20 to 27. Langelier felt there was a perception . that Lauer was 'king' and others on the show aren't equal to him. Lyle . Nelson, 40, a salesman from Avondale, Arizona, said Lauer was 'not someone . I'd like to have a beer with'. 'There is something about Matt Lauer, . whether or not he was the reason for Curry's firing, that has changed . and I do not like watching the show anymore,' said John Friia, a . 20-year-old aspiring journalist from Malverne, New York. Fortunately for NBC, viewers don't seem to be taking out their unhappiness on Guthrie. Producers often say that viewing . decisions for morning television can be intensely personal, since people . are essentially inviting these personalities into their homes at an . intimate time of day when they were getting ready for work. Feeling a . part of the TV 'family' they see on air is part of it, and sometimes the . reasoning seems strange. Nelson said, for example, that he didn't like . the couch on Today because it looked uncomfortable. 'In today's doom and gloom news . programs, the Today show gave me a lift to get my day started,' said . Taren Robin, 48, from Paris, Kentucky. 'I don't get that lift anymore, and I . am in mourning over the fact. I haven't found anything I like better to . take its place.' At least one-third of people who responded to a Twitter request to discuss the show cited its content for their discontent. 'I used to be a regular Today show . viewer but got tired of their formula,' said Dan Laufer, 35, a sports . marketer from Washington, D.C. 'Five minutes of hard news followed by an . animal rescue story, the Kardashians and then pop culture or fashion. It's OK with me — in moderation.' Joan Pierce is a 64-year-old retired . nurse from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, who watched Today for 40 years. Now . she says: 'I don't care what Lindsay Lohan does.' 'I was fed up with the lack of actual . news reporting, and more intense focus on silly, irrelevant things like . women's fashion or the newest celebrity's recipe for a dinner I could . never find the time or money to cook,' said Zach Beale, a 23-year-old . college student in Savannah, Georgia. Biting as they may be, at least those . complaints offer Today the seeds of potential recovery. Leading ladies: Katie Couric (left) and Meredith Viera (right) were Matt's female foils for many seasons and are said to be deeply missed by viewers . Good Morning . America, particularly in its second hour, has an even greater pop . culture emphasis. Bell said his show will try to draw a greater contrast . with its ABC rival in coming months. A recent ad with Lauer touts the . 'informative' nature of the show. Curry, who has kept her job with NBC . as a hard news reporter, appeared on Today during the past month . interviewing Libyan President Mohammed Magarief and reporting from . Syria. CBS has already tried to position itself . as a newsier alternative in the morning. Because Today has a richer . history and often twice as many viewers, it would be in better position . to reach people who want this. NBC announced this week that Willie . Geist, an engaging and popular member of MSNBC's Morning Joe team, . will join Today as a co-host of the 9am hour and occasionally . appear earlier. 'What I loved about the show were the . hosts, reporters and the stories,' said Miriam Sajecki, a marketer from . Staten Island, New York, who has watched Today for more than 20 years. 'It . was always delivered in a friendly, engaging and informative manner. Some of that has changed in that I miss the chemistry that was displayed . with the prior hosts ... and some of the stories Today was known for. 'It has evolved into forgettable reports without giving me the important . news and educational stories.' Still, Sajecki is a loyalist. 'I will continue to watch the Today show and wake up to it every weekday,' she said. NBC needs devoted fans like Sajecki to turn things around. It will take some time.","GMA has 110,000 more viewers each .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:27 EST, 11 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:12 EST, 16 October 2012 . Asif Mallu, 37, was head of a company which made inflated claims for compensation . A claims company owner who made thousands of pounds through a series of car insurance crash scams has been branded 'outrageous' by a judge. Asif Mallu, 37, was head of a business which made inflated claims for compensation after a team of cowboy drivers were paid £500 a time to stage a string of car crashes. Over a three year period one hired driver staged a total of 93 road smashes by unexpectedly slamming the brakes at roundabouts so innocent motorists following had no chance of avoiding ploughing into the back of him. The shocked motorists were then sued through accident claims firms for damages and injuries for an average £17,000 a time. The scam was uncovered in 2005 when . workers at an office block overlooking a roundabout on the A34 near . Cheadle, Greater Manchester, spotted the same driver being involved in . various low speed crashes of a striking similarity. AXA insurance, one of the companies affected by the scam, investigated a number of the claims and alerted police in 2008. Convicted robber Mallu had run claims management company 24/7 Direct Claims based in Bolton, Greater Manchester, which earned fees for referring people involved in car accidents to solicitors. A court heard he created false invoices to support bogus claims for vehicle recovery, storage and repair after a number of car crashes. He also represented fraudulent claimants in support of personal injury claims. The scam which involved another accident claims firm was the biggest of its kind in Britain. Today, Mallu, from Halliwell, in Bolton, the last man to face trial over the scam, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and was jailed for 21 months. Passing sentence at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Judge Bernard Lever said: 'This is a particularly serious fraud which has become something of a public scandal. 'Millions and millions of pounds of motorists’ money and their inflated premiums are involved and this man has bought into a scandalous fraud the length and breadth of this country. 'The clearest message will come out of this court today - people who get in a crash for cash scam and you, will go to prison.' He told Mallu: 'These cases are very very complex to investigate and it is very complex to bring people like you to justice. 'This man was going round and round the roundabout just stopping all of a sudden until somebody went into the back of him - and he could secure a fraudulent claim. 'This is absolutely outrageous behaviour which causes every single person’s premium in the country to go higher than it needs to be. Mohammed Patel who staged 93 car crashes is pictured at Eden Point roundabout near Cheadle in Greater Manchester where many of the crashes took place . 'You may not have been the person who was driving. You may not have been the person who made false claims and who was the owner of the vehicle. 'You may not have been the person in the vehicle who had falsely claimed whiplash - but you were from the claims company. 'For these claims to be pursued they needed claims managers like you in order to push on the production line. You were a necessary part of it.' The . scam was revealed after office workers noticed that driver Mohammed Patel, then 24, was involved in five different smashes . at the same roundabout. Further investigation found he was involved in another 88 across the North of England. The scam which involved another accident claims firm was the biggest of its kind in Britain . A Mercedes CLK wrecked after one of the collisions - the scam which involved another accident claims firm was the biggest of its kind in Britain . He was found to have earned at least £46,000 from his frauds and spent the money on a Mercedes C class coupe and a Lincoln Navigator cars, plus designer clothes, a plasma TV and exotic holidays. Reports from an engineer showed the insurance claims for damage and whiplash were exaggerated and in some cases totally made up. Mohammed Patel who was jailed for four and a half years after he staged over 90 car crashes . Patel was subsequently jailed for four and a half years for his role on the scam. But police said the biggest profit went to claims management companies such as 24/7, who processed the claims. The court heard Mallu who was arrested in March 2009 was involved in seven different frauds which could have netted £67,000 but many were foiled. He was found to have made a personal profit of £12,000 and was ordered to pay back £7,250. His counsel Miss Lisa Judge, defending, said: 'He had a troublesome childhood and was the black sheep of the family, so was disregarded.' 'He is a different man now. He is a changed man with many great and serious life experiences which have nurtured him significantly. 'He’s not the man which would have stood before you in 2005. He has a total change of perspective of life.' But Chief Insp Mark Dexter of Greater . Manchester Police said: 'Mallu’s company was all a front for fraud. A . long and complex investigation has proven that he profited significantly . from the scam. 'While . insurance companies are victims, the innocent drivers involved in these . collisions were made to feel as though they were in the wrong. 'The . scam left these victims feeling cheated and violated, often with their . premiums increased, so the idea that this is a victimless crime is . nonsense.” During the . inquiry police went to claims management companies in Bolton and Burnley . and a number of solicitors’ offices, from which they seized documents. In all 700 false claims were found to have been made. The Mercedes and Lincoln Navigator car Patel bought for girlfriend Ettorina Hay with the proceeds of the scam .

A self-confessed ‘psycho,’ who attacked his ex-partner with a meat cleaver and a boat flare before drugging his baby daughter with heroin, has been jailed for 18 years. Gillian Blackmore, 28, had to run for her life, naked and soaked in blood, as her ex-partner Roger Weir unleashed his attack. The 45-year-old beat his former fiancee repeatedly with a metal baton, shooting her with a boat flare and slashing her neck with a meat cleaver at her flat in Eastleigh, Southampton. Self-confessed 'psycho': Roger Weir (right) was jailed for 18 years for a violent attack on his former fiancee Gillian Blackmore (left) and their 20-month-old daughter when he discovered that she had a new partner . Weir turned violent when he found out that Miss Blackmore had found a new man after they split up and he did not want her new partner raising his 20-month-old child. After telling Miss Blackmore ‘I want you dead’ and firing at her with an adapted flare gun, he threatened to kill their daughter by feeding her heroin. Sentencing an emotionless Weir today at Winchester Crown Court, Judge Keith Cutler said the attack had a severe psychological impact on Miss Blackmore, who had thought she and her baby were going to die. Describing himself as ‘a psycho that tried to kill his ex-wife’, Weir said he had ‘snapped’ and blamed voices in his head for his actions, the court heard. Weir, frustrated by family court proceedings between the pair, had arrived at the flat with the baton and flare as ‘props’. In his rage, he picked up the cleaver and struck Miss Blackmore with it at least twice. Judge Cutler said: ‘When you fired the flare she thought “This is it” and felt she was going to die at your hands. After split: Weir attacked Gillian Blackmore, 28, with a flare gun and slashed her neck with this meat cleaver. Judge Keith Cutler said: 'If the weapons had landed on her head instead, she would be dead' ‘Afterwards, with some courage, she tried to escape you and stop any further attack on her. ‘Not . only did Gillian feel she was going to be killed by you, but for quite . some time she also feared for the life and the health of her child.’ Graphic photos showed three inch wounds Weir inflicted on Miss Blackmore’s neck, Judge Cutler said. He said: ‘If the weapons had landed on her head instead, she would be dead.’ Weir had gone round to make his former partner ‘sit and listen to him’, but the situation escalated, the court heard. Miss Blackmore, surrounded by family and friends in the packed public gallery, wept as the traumatic events were recounted. Judge Cutler handed Weir 16 years for attempted murder and two years for administering a noxious substance to his child, to run consecutively. Weir, who previously served in the Territorial Army, had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing. Nigel Pascoe QC, mitigating, said Weir had been suicidal in the wake of the relationship break up. The dramatic events came to a head in a standoff with armed police, alerted by the young mother’s 999 call from outside her flat, to rescue the toddler from Weir’s clutches. Weir, from Poole, Dorset, had locked himself and his daughter in her bedroom, the court heard. Run for her life: Miss Blackmore ran from her flat (pictured) in Eastleigh, Hampshire, naked and soaked in blood screaming that Weir was going to kill her daughter . Officers found the hallway full of smoke because Weir had let off the flare gun, which set the carpet alight. He could be heard shouting: ‘Don’t come in here or I’ll shoot the baby.’ Eventually officers persuaded Weir to allow them to retrieve the baby, before armed police rushed in and found him on a sofa. He was holding a large kitchen knife to his neck and had already slashed his wrist. As he was searched, he said: ‘I have given the baby heroin, I wanted her to die with me... I wanted her and me dead.’ Weir later told police he had squirted heroin into his daughter’s mouth with a syringe ‘to get at her mother’ but regretted it and stopped, the court heard. Toxicology reports revealed there were only traces of the drug in her system. The horrific ordeal began when Weir returned their daughter to her mother in the early hours as she wouldn’t settle at his home then refused to leave. He showed Miss Blackmore a bullet and pulled a mini flare gun from his pocket, telling her that if he removed part of it, he could fire the bullet. He added that he had come equipped with 7ounces of heroin and intended to kill their daughter as well. Severe impact: In sentencing today at Winchester Crown Court (pictured) Judge Cutler said the attack had a severe psychological impact on Miss Blackmore . Scared, she managed to ring 999 but discarded her phone when the attack intensified. As he approached her with the gun and fired it, she thought she was going to be shot dead. She described hearing a ‘pop’ and feeling something in her side. Weir then used the baton, hitting her about four times on the back of her legs before ripping her dressing gown from her. He struck her twice with the meat cleaver on the back of her neck before she managed to flee into the street. Outside, Miss Blackmore’s new partner Barry Towler, an off-duty police community support officer, saw Miss Blackmore running towards him. She was screaming and covered in blood, saying that Weir was going to kill her little girl. Mr Towler tried to get into the flat but was stopped by police, who were already inside trying to rescue the child, the court was told. Weir told the court today: ‘I wish to apologise unreservedly for my conduct to Gillian and our wonderful little daughter. ‘While there may be mitigation and explanation, I do not feel and would not argue that there was any justification for it, in part or in whole.’ Mr Pascoe said Weir was grateful to the surgeons who fought to save his right hand, after he severely damaged his tendons. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Roger Weir was jailed for 18 years for his violent attack on his ex-fiancee .

'Even though this mission was only a few minutes long, it marks a big breakthrough in coronal studies,' said Smithsonian astronomer Leon Golub (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), one of the lead investigators on the mission. Since Hi-C rode on a suborbital rocket, . its flight lasted for just 10 minutes. Of that time, only about 330 . seconds were spent taking data. ""The Hi-C flight might be the most productive five minutes I've ever spent,"" Understanding the Sun's activity and its effects on Earth's environment was the critical scientific objective of Hi-C, which provided unprecedented views of the dynamic activity and structure in the solar atmosphere. 'The phrase 'think globally, act locally' applies to the Sun too,' said Golub. 'Things happening at a small, local scale can impact the entire Sun and result in an eruption,' explained Golub. Researchers with the hi-res Nasa Hi-C rocket that took stunning images of the sun's corona . The corona surrounds the visible surface of the Sun. It is filled with million-degree ionized gas, or plasma, so hot that the light it emits is mainly at X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet wavelengths. For decades, solar scientists have been trying to understand why the corona is so hot, and why it erupts in violent solar flares and related blasts known as ""coronal mass ejections,"" which can produce harmful effects when they hit Earth. The Hi-C telescope was designed and built to see the extremely fine structures thought to be responsible for the Sun's dynamic behavior. Hi-C focused on an active region on the Sun near sunspot NOAA 1520. The target, which was finalized on launch day, was selected specifically for its large size and active nature. The resulting high-resolution snapshots, at a wavelength of 19.3 nanometers (25 times shorter than the wavelength of visible light), reveal tangled magnetic fields channeling the solar plasma into a range of complex structures. The project was a collaboration between University of Central Lancashire, NASA and Smithsonian. Dr Robert Walsh, University Director of Research at UCLan, said: 'These first images taken by the Hi-C camera are truly awe-inspiring and have surpassed our expectations.'We are now able to analyse structural aspects of the Sun at a level of complexity we’ve never been able to achieve before. 'The image quality is comparable to looking at a reflection in a steamed up mirror and then wiping it clean to reveal the true detail. 'Findings from the Hi-C Mission will help us to understand the outer atmosphere of the Sun, learn more about the electrified gases that erupt from it along with the mechanisms that generate the energy it releases; all of which have knock on effects on Earth.' 'We have an exceptional instrument and launched at the right time,"" said Jonathan Cirtain, senior heliophysicist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. 'Because of the intense solar activity we're seeing right now, we were able to clearly focus on a sizeable, active sunspot and achieve our imaging goals.'","New images show the Sun 's corona up close for the first time .

Nasa has revealed new pictures of Curiosity 'looking back' at one of its cameras on the martian surface. It comes as they confirmed the rover has now tested its robotic arm successfully, using a 1909 penny and a piece of rock from New Mexico to calibrate its instruments. The team admitted even they were surprised by the quality of images being sent back after dust covers were removed from the rover's main cameras. Nasa today released this incredible image of Curiosity on the red planet, showing off its wheels and four 'navcams' which act as the rover's eyes on the red planet. 'Wow, seeing these images after all the tremendous hard work that has . gone into making them possible is a profoundly emotional moment,' said . MAHLI Principal Investigator Ken Edgett of Malin Space Science Systems, . San Diego. 'It is so exciting to see the camera returning beautiful, . sharp images from Mars.' NASA's Mars rover Curiosity stepped . through activities on Sept. 7, 8 and 9 designed to check and . characterize precision movements by the rover's robotic arm and use of . tools on the arm. The activities confirmed good health and usefulness of Mars Hand Lens . Imager, or MAHLI, and used that camera to check arm placement during . several positioning activities. MAHLI took an image with its reclosable dust cover open for the first . time on Mars, confirming sharp imaging capability that had been obscured . by a thin film of dust on the cover during previous use of the camera. It took images of cameras at the top of Curiosity's mast, of the . underbelly of the rover and of MAHLI's own calibration target, among . other pointings. The camera's calibration target includes a 1909 Lincoln penny that . Edgett purchased for this purpose. The team calibrated the camera using a 'lucky penny' on the rover's mast . 'We're seeing the penny in the . foreground and, looking past it, a setting I'm sure the people who . minted these coins never imagined,' Edgett said. The penny is a nod to geologists' tradition of placing a coin or other . object of known scale as a size reference in close-up photographs of . rocks, and it gives the public a familiar object for perceiving size . easily when it will be viewed by MAHLI on Mars. 'The folks who drive the rover's arm and turret have taken a 220-pound . arm through some very complex tai chi, to center a penny in an image . that's only a few centimeters across,' said MAHLI Deputy Principal . Investigator Aileen Yingst of the Tucson-based Planetary Science . Institute. 'They make the impossible look easy.' The arm characterization activities, including more imaging by MAHLI, . will continue for a few days before Curiosity resumes driving toward a . mid-term science destination area called Glenelg. In that area, the . rover may use its scoop to collect a soil sample, and later its drill to . collect a sample of powder from inside a rock. Curiosity is five weeks into a two-year prime mission on Mars. It will . use 10 science instruments to assess whether the selected study area . ever has offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life. A sample of basaltic rock from a lava flow in New Mexico serves as a calibration target for the rover's Canadian-made Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer . Nasa today revealed stunning new images of Curiosity's wheel on the martian surface taken using the high resolution Mahli camera, which had its dustcover removed for the first time . Wheels down: Nasa used the newly uncovered Mahli camera to take a series of images of the rover's wheel on the red planet's surface . The new images also give tantalising views of the nearby mountains that Curiosity will eventually climb in its quest for for ingredients of life on the red planet .

Mair Wallroth thought she had a blocked milk duct, but was told a lump in her breast was cancerous when she was 23 weeks’ pregnant. Luckily she could receive a type of . chemotherapy that wasn't harmful to her unborn child and she gave birth this month to 7lb Merlin Ray, at Tameside Hospital. Mair Wallroth said with hindsight she should have realised she was at greater risk of breast cancer as she had a family history of the disease . The 41-year-old from Hadfield near Glossop, is half-way through her treatment. The manager for Manchester City Council now faces more chemotherapy and a mastectomy, but says she has received fantastic support especially from her husband Pete, 32. Mrs Wallroth, who is also mother to Martha May, aged three, initially wasn't concerned about her breast lump until her obstetrician said she should get it checked out. Baby joy: Mair with Merlin. She is still undergoing cancer treatment . She said: 'I went to the one-stop breast clinic at Tameside and it was diagnosed there and then that I had a 6.5cm tumour. 'It was just shocking, everything happened so quickly and there almost wasn’t enough time to think about it. At that point, I thought ""what is this going to do to my unborn baby?"".

While breast cancer in pregnancy is rare - it affects about one in 3,000 pregnant women - it is the most common cancer diagnosed during pregnancy. Pregnancy doesn’t cause breast cancer, but it is believed that pregnancy hormones can accelerate the growth of breast cancer. With hindsight, Mrs Wallroth, whose prognosis is good, can see that she was at a high risk of breast cancer after her mum and two maternal aunts were diagnosed with the disease. She said: 'You think you’re invincible but you’re not, and it shows how important raising awareness is. It is so important to check your breasts regularly at any age and if you find anything, whether you’re male or female, to get it checked out.'","Mother-of-two initially thought breast lump was a blocked milk duct .

A 'sleep fetishist' who spiked two women’s drinks and took pictures of them unconscious before raping one has been jailed for eight years. Robert Fryer, 30, drugged the women before taking lurid photos while they were passed out leaving his victims’ lives 'completely shattered', a court heard. Nottingham Crown Court was told Fryer led a 'Jekyll and Hyde life' and suffered from somnophilia - a condition which makes him aroused by 'interfering' with a sleeping woman. His depraved actions were only discovered when he boasted to a friend that he had 'spiked the drinks of a number of girls' before taking pictures of them 'in various sexual poses' while they slept, the court was told. Despite assuming Fryers was joking, the friend went to police who later found 'hundreds of pornographic images of adult females in an apparent unconscious state' on his mobile phone and computer. Fryer, of Thurgarton, Nottinghamshire, pleaded guilty to three charges of rape and one charge of assault by penetration involving one of the victims on Friday. He also admitted causing another woman to engage in sexual activity without consent, and a further charge of sexual assault. Judge Jonathan Teare jailed Fryer for eight years for the three charges of rape and one charge of assault by penetration, to be served concurrently. He was also sentenced to three years for the other two charges, also concurrent. He will be on the Sex Offenders’ Register for life and banned from working with children. Judge Teare told him: 'You have never been in any sort of criminal trouble before, but having said that underlying your personality has been what almost amounts to an illness for some years. Boasts: Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) heard how his depraved actions were only discovered when he boasted about his crimes to a friend . 'I have to approach the sentence on the basis that you did administer either alcohol or drugs to both of these girls, and that you took complete advantage of their unconsciousness.' Christopher Lowe, prosecuting, told the court: 'An informer reported to the police to the effect that he (Fryer) had been talking about how on a number of occasions he had spiked the drinks of a number of girls and having done that photographed them in various sexual poses while in an unconscious state. 'To start with the friend put that admission down as some sort of sick boast or joke, however, such was their concern they decided to report it to the police. 'You took advantage': Jailing Fryer for eight years, Judge Jonathan Teare said he had 'what almost amounts to an illness for some years' 'There were hundreds of pornographic images of adult females in an apparent unconscious state on his phone and computer. 'Among them were pictures of the two women who had no recollection of them having been taken.'

'On one hand he was a young man from a good family but all the time there was this dark side to him which has caused him to be here today. 'The psychiatric report shows someone who recognises that he has had a problem.' Fryer also pleaded not guilty to further charges of assault by penetration, two charges of sexual assault, and one charge of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.

This unlucky tabby cat lost an eye after being shot with an airgun and X-rays of the injured pet showed another pellet lodged in his chest. Oscar the cat is two lives down after he was shot right through the centre of his eye with an airgun and, while having surgery to remove the metal pellet, vets discovered the other one from a previous attack and it is unclear how long it has been there. Owners Amanda and Steven Leadbetter discovered three-year-old Oscar lying in the garden, covered in blood at their home in Findon Valley, Worthing, West Sussex. Unlucky tabby: Oscar the cat lost his eye after being shot with an airgun and X-rays revealed a second pellet in his chest from a previous attack . The injured tabby is now back at home recovering after the hour-long operation to remove his eye. Mrs Leadbetter, 36 said: ‘It was terrible. We found him lying at the bottom of the garden covered in blood and rushed him to the vet. When they X-rayed him they found the pellet in his eye and then another metal pellet in his chest. ‘We had a sleepless night because we didn’t think he’d make it. It was touch and go and we were beside ourselves. ‘They had to remove his eye but his . stitches will come out on Saturday and he’s doing OK. He’s eating and . purring, which is a huge relief. He’s such a sweet, kind-natured cat.’ Straight through: X-rays of Oscar's head revealed the pellet which went straight through the cat's right eye . Previous attack: X-rays also revealed a second airgun pellet lodged in his chest which vets decoded to leave there after they found it was not causing the cat any problems . Mrs Leadbetter, who works as a hairdresser, said people often shoot rabbits at the nearby fort Cissbury Ring where Oscar often goes prowling. She said: ‘People shoot rabbits up there and it could be hugely bad luck that he has been shot twice by someone doing that. ‘But it’s very suspect, especially as they got him right in the eye. If it was deliberate then it’s a vile act.’ Steve Wickham, the animal welfare officer at the RSPCA in Worthing, is investigating the case. He said: ‘I’m relying on the public to let us know if they saw someone doing this. Bad luck or a vile act? Owner Amanda Leadbetter says people shoot rabbits in the area where Oscar goes prowling so she is unsure whether it is extremely bad luck or a deliberate, 'vile act' ‘We will prosecute if we have evidence. In cases where we have the airgun pellet or bullet, we pass it to the police and they can match it to the gun and we have had successful prosecutions.’ The vet decided to leave the pellet found in Oscar's chest as it was because it was not causing him any problems. A cat miraculously survived when it was shot three times in the face with an airgun and nearly hanged in a savage assault in 2010 in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Another cat dragged himself two miles after he was shot twice with an airgun, even scaling a seven-foot fence, to get home in Girton in Cambridgeshire last year. Gigio the cat was close to death after thugs fired at his head and chest, leaving him with a collapsed lung and a ruptured diaphragm.","Oscar the cat was shot right through the eye with an airgun .

An elderly war veteran today accused shoppers of ignoring his cries for help as he was pinned to his car and robbed in a busy supermarket car park in broad daylight. Michael Saxby, 83, said he was screaming for assistance as a man and woman trapped him against his car outside his local Tesco and then made away with his modest life savings. Nobody ran to aid the frail pensioner - who can only walk with crutches - even though the attack happened just 20 yards from the supermarket entrance at 11.30am on a busy Friday morning. Mr Saxby, of Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, believes the thieves filmed him on a mobile phone as he entered his PIN at the supermarket checkout. They later mugged him for his wallet and emptied his account of the £700 he relies on to tide him over with his pension payments. The grandfather, whose legs were injured in the 1950s by a landmine in the Malayan Emergency conflict while he served as an RAF medical orderly, today said he is devastated by those who failed to assist him. He said: 'I went to my car about six spaces from the main entrance when this man took my wallet out of my pocket and then pinned me to my car. 'He kneed me in the chest and when I fought back, the woman grabbed my wrist and snatched my wallet and took my bank cards. 'What made me really angry and upset was I was screaming for help at the top of my voice and there were around ten people nearby who just walked by and didn’t help. 'One woman did start to approach us but . then the woman robber put her finger to her head as if to tell her I was . mad and the lady walked away.'

The widower, who who worked at Addenbrooke’s Hospital for 43 years and was honoured by the Royal Humane Society in 1942 for saving a drowning boy from a river, believes the thieves had monitored him while inside the store. Mr Saxby said: 'I had seen the woman who grabbed my wrist in the supermarket restaurant. 'She had her phone up every time an older person was at the till. I am sure she was filming us putting in our PIN.' Police hunting the assailants today described them as both wearing dark clothing.

A Republican representative who shocked America when he said women don't become pregnant if they are victims of 'legitimate rape' has become embroiled in a new abortion row. Todd Akin, a nominee for Senate in Missouri, caused a national outcry in August by claiming that it was rare for a woman to become pregnant after being raped because the 'female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down'. Now footage has emerged of him claiming abortions are performed on women who 'are not actually pregnant'. Scroll down for video . Controversial views: Todd Akin, the Repubican nominee for Senate in Missouri, claimed abortions are performed on women who 'are not actually pregnant' He also said that doctors who perform abortions are 'terrorists' who work at hospitals mired in a 'culture of death'. His remarks were made during a 2008 speech to the House of Representatives. Mr Akin said: 'It is no big surprise that we fight the terrorists because they are fundamentally un-American, and yet we have terrorists in our own culture called abortionists. 'One of the good pieces of news why we are winning this war is because there are not enough heartless doctors being graduated from medical schools. There is a real shortage of abortionists. Who wants to be at the very bottom of the food chain of medical profession? 'And what sort of places do these bottom-of-the-food-chain doctors work in? Places that are really a pit. 'You find that along with the culture of death go all kinds of other law-breaking - not following good sanitary procedure, giving abortions to women who are not actually pregnant, cheating on taxes, all these kinds of things, misuse of anesthetics so that people die or almost die.' In August, Mr Akin told the Jaco Report that it was rare for a woman to become pregnant after being raped as he was explaining his no-exception rule when it comes to abortion. 'First of all, from what I understand from doctors, (pregnancy from rape) is really rare,' the GOP stalwart told KTVI-TV. 'If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.' At loggerheads: Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill (left) criticised Mr Akin (right) in August for saying women who are the victims of 'legitimate rape' cannot become pregnant . He went on to say: 'But let’s assume . that maybe that didn’t work or something. I think there should be some . punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not . attacking the child.' Mr . Akin has served six terms and describes himself as Missouri's most . conservative congressman. He is running against Democratic Senator . Claire McCaskill. After Mr Akin made the remarks, Senator McCaskill tweeted: 'As a woman & former prosecutor who handled 100s of rape cases, I'm stunned by Rep Akin's comments about victims this AM.' As Twitter buzzed with comments criticizing Akin's opinions, he quickly sought to backtrack. A statement from Mr Akin read: 'In reviewing my off-the-cuff remarks, it's clear that I misspoke in this interview and it does not reflect the deep empathy I hold for the thousands of women who are raped and abused every year.' According to Talking Points Memo, Mr Akin voted in 1991 for an anti-marital-rape law. At the time, he queried whether the legislation might be misused 'in a real messy divorce as a tool and a legal weapon to beat up on the husband'. Pulling no punches: Mr Akin, known for his strict anti-abortion stance, said on television in August that it was rare for women to become pregnant after being raped . He was elected to the Missouri House of . Representatives in 1988 and is a vocal anti-abortion campaigner with no . exceptions for rape or incest. His website bears the motto: . 'Timeless principles for today's challenges.' He opposes embryonic stem . cell research and stands firmly behind the right to bear arms. Mr . Akin has a history of stirring up controversy with his remarks. Last . June, he said that TV network NBC's decision to cut the words 'under . God' from a video clip of the Pledge of Allegiance was the work of . liberals in the media motivated by a 'hatred of God'. He . refused to apologize for the statement and clarified his remark by . saying he did not mean that liberals hated God but 'public references of . God'. The 65-year-old military veteran married wife Lulli in 1975 and the couple have six children.

A conman who said he had served in the army when he was actually in prison has been spared jail for conning people into giving him donations for charity Help for Heroes. Despite admitting his deceit - and a string of 48 previous convictions - Robert Santangelo, 41, was spared jail. He told rail commuters that he was collecting on behalf of war-wounded soldiers - despite being struck off by the charity months before. Suspicious travellers at Weeley Railway Station, near Clacton, Essex, raised the alarm after spotting the defendant drinking cans of beer whilst offering out Help for Heroes charity wristbands. When confronted by a railway enforcement officer in December last year, he said: 'How about I smash your f*cking face in?' During an interview following his arrest, Santangelo told detectives about his military record serving with the parachute regiment in Rwanda - though further investigation revealed the regiment had not been stationed there since 1994. Police officers could not find any trace of his military past and discovered he had actually been serving a four-month prison sentence when he claimed to have been serving his country. Santangelo had previously had his . permission to collect revoked after being found drunk while collecting . for the charity in Newquay, Cornwall. Santangelo, from Colchester, Essex, pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud by false representation and a further charge of using threatening and abusive language at an earlier hearing at North Essex Magistrates’ Court. Despite 48 previous offences - including dishonesty, battery, criminal damage and theft - Santangelo was let off with an eight-month sentence suspended for 12 months when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday. Judge Anthony Goldstaub QC - who had deferred sentencing to review how Santangelo was dealing with drug and alcohol problems - said: 'You are making slow progress, but it is in the right direction.' Bryn Parry, CEO and Co-Founder of Help for Heroes, said the charity has no record of ever receiving funds from Santangelo.

A scientist who helped design the trigger mechanism for the atomic bombs used in the Second World War has died, at the age of 96. Robert F Christy, a former California Institute of Technology (Caltech) professor, was one of the early recruits to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos Laboratory, a U.S. government research project to develop atomic weapons during the war. However - during his research - he was never told the true purpose of the experiments, he later said. Robert F Christy pictured, left, in recent years and, right, as a young scientist. He was one of the early recruits to Project Manhattan and his work helped develop the trigger mechanism for the atomic bomb . The mushroom cloud formed by the explosion of an atomic bomb. Christy said that, at the time of their work, he had no idea their research would be used for a weapon . He had been hand-picked to join by J. Robert Oppenheimer - his professor at the . University of California, Berkeley, with whom Christy studied quantum mechanics. The Canadian native devised what came to be known as the Christy bomb or Christy gadget, a plutonium implosion device. Christy died of natural causes at his home in Pasadena, surrounded by his family, according to Caltech spokeswoman Deborah Williams-Hedges. According to a 1994 interview recorded in Caltech's archives, Vancouver-born Christy showed mathematical prowess early in his . schooling and skipped grades to graduate from the University of British . Columbia when he was 19. The Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico, one of Project Manhattan's research centres . When the first bomb was tested at Los Alamos (pictured), Christy said everyone was pleased to have succeeded in the experiment . Before the Manhattan Project began, Christy researched with the era's leading physicists, including Italian Enrico Fermi and Hungarian Eugene Wigner. He said in the 1994 interview: 'What I was told was that they were trying to make a chain reaction. 'And the purpose of the chain reaction - well, it might be to drive submarines, or whatever. I was not told about bombs at the time.' When the first bomb was tested at Los Alamos, Christy said everyone was pleased to have succeeded in the experiment, but a month later, when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, it was a very sobering experience. He added: 'There had been bombs dropped on cities. There had been firestorms, and so forth. I believe people nowadays don't realise that in war your objective is to beat the enemy. 'And unfortunately, mostly that involves killing a lot of the enemy to do that. So war is a very bloody thing. Later in life, Christy opposed the further development of nuclear weapons. He became a member of the National Research Council's committee on dosimetry . 'I felt then that although this was a terrible event, it probably saved many, many more Japanese lives. They probably would have lost millions if they had had to defend themselves against an invasion.' Later in life, Christy opposed the further development of nuclear weapons. He became a member of the National Research Council's committee on dosimetry, which studied the radiation effects of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs. Christy taught theoretical physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics at Caltech, going on to serve as faculty chair, vice president and provost, as well as acting president. While at Caltech, he investigated pulsations in the brightness of stars, which are used to measure cosmic distances. Christy was awarded the Royal Astronomical Society's Eddington Medal for his work. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1965. Caltech Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy Chair B. Thomas Soifer said that Christy was a major figure at the private university and a founder of a very important area of astrophysical research. Soifer added: 'Bob was an outstanding theoretical physicist; his contributions to scientific research, to public policy and his leadership helped in shaping what Caltech is today.' A joint effort between the U.S., the UK and Canada, the Manhattan . Project was a research and development programme that produced the first . atomic bomb during the Second World War. It began in 1939 as a modest operation, but grew to involve more than . 130,000 people costing about $2billion working across 30 sites in . America, Britain and Canada - some of them top secret. The first-ever nuclear device was detonated in New Mexico on July 16 1945. Less than a month later it was unleashed on unsuspecting Japan. On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped a massive atomic bomb on . Hiroshima.

A woman left paralysed from head to toe after a bout of tonsillitis has made a miraculous recovery. Becki Bolger, 25, spent four months fighting for her life after the throat infection triggered the killer nerve disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome. The condition attacks the lining of the nerves, leaving patients unable to move, swallow or breathe unassisted. Becki Bolger spent four months battling the deadly nerve disorder Guillain-Barre Syndrome triggered by tonsillitis. She has since made a full recovery . Miss Bolger, a council worker from Coventry, survived despite her lungs collapsing twice and suffering pneumonia five times. She has since gone on to stun medics by learning to walk and talk again. She said: 'Doctors told my family they didn’t think I was going to make it as I had a severe form of the disorder. 'I was so scared about what was happening that they had to heavily sedate me. 'My recovery has been a very slow process. When I took my first steps, I sobbed. It was amazing.' Miss Bolger was enjoying a weekend away in London with boyfriend Steve Coulson, 34, when she fell ill in October 2010. Fiance Steve Coulson kept a bedside vigil while Miss Bolger fought pneumonia five times . 'I’d had tonsillitis but I thought I’d feel better when I got to London. We’d only been going out together for six weeks so I didn’t want to cancel. Over the weekend her legs and feet became sore and numb. 'It was like I had really bad pins and needles.' By the time the couple returned, she couldn’t walk or speak and was rushed to University Hospital Coventry. Luckily, Miss Bolger was seen by a doctor who recognised she had Guillain-Barre syndrome, despite it being so rare. She was immediately rushed to intensive care and put on a ventilator to breathe for her. 'I was paralysed from head to toe - I didn’t know what was happening but I was so scared,' she recalls. Over the next four months her family kept a vigil at her bedside. And despite only being together a few weeks, Mr Coulson visited her every day. Her family event ate their Christmas dinner in the hospital so she wouldn’t miss out, even though she has no memory of the day. They, along with Mr Coulson and the nurses, kept diaries of everything she did - such as the slightest movement - and what was happening in the outside world to help her recover the time she lost. 'When I woke up, mum told me how seriously ill I was and I just cried. I didn’t know what was going to happen to me. 'But I cried more for the people around me having to watch how poorly I was. It was so hard on them.' Doctors told Miss Bolger's family to prepare for the worst as she had a severe form of Guillain-Barre syndrome . Nurses and family wrote diaries for Miss Bolger while she was sedated and on a ventilator . In February last year, Miss Bolger slowly started to breathe on her own and doctors removed her ventilator. She was moved from intensive care to a ward and slowly began to get the feeling back in her arms and legs. With the help of physiotherapy, Miss Bolger had to re-learn how to do everything. 'I couldn’t even sit up by myself and had to learn how to hold a cup, brush my hair, clean my teeth. I’d taken all these things for granted before. 'It was very hard. I didn’t know if I would be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life.' But months later, she took her first steps with a walking frame and she was eventually strong enough to leave hospital. She has since returned to work and, better still, is busy planning her wedding after Mr Coulson proposed in February this year. 'Steve has seen me at my worst but he stuck by me and has been my rock. I really wouldn’t be here without his and my family’s support. 'I’m also so thankful to the doctors and nurses for saving my life. I still can’t believe something like tonsillitis caused it.' Guillain-Barre (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements. It affects about 1,500 people in the UK every year and is slightly more common in men than women. It causes the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness) to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed. Symptoms include a tingly, numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement. Most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection (such as tonsillitis) a few weeks before. Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage.

David Cameron today promises a relentless focus on what matters ‘to the backbone of Britain – those who work hard and ‘do the right thing’. The Prime Minister, who is seeking to use his party’s annual conference to revive Conservative fortunes, makes a direct pitch to the striving blue collar families that Margaret Thatcher won from Labour in the 1980s. He ridicules Ed Miliband’s attempt last week to seize the traditional ‘one nation’ mantle from the Tories, saying the Labour leader’s vision sounded ‘more like East Germany than Great Britain’. Mr Cameron dismisses senior Tory MPs calling for a sharp move to the Right, telling the Daily Mail that suggestions he is abandoning the centre ground of politics ‘could not be further from the truth’. As he seeks to back ‘those who work hard and want to get on in life’, the Prime Minister is preparing new policies on welfare, the cost of living and the NHS. These include: . - A fresh crackdown on welfare, with housing benefit expected to be limited to the over-25s . - Measures to enable employees to take stakes in the firms they work for . - A revival of Mrs Thatcher’s flagship ‘right to buy’ policy for people living in council and social housing . - New Budget measures to help families with the cost of living . Mr Cameron is also reaffirming his commitment to protect the NHS budget from spending cuts, with £140million in funding to enable nurses and midwives to spend more time with patients instead of paperwork. The Government is setting up a £15million cancer radiotherapy innovation fund and a guarantee that from April next year all cancer patients will have access to the most innovative radiotherapy where clinically appropriate, safe and cost-effective. The Prime Minister is also seeking to . address a slide in support for the Conservatives among a key group of . voters dubbed ‘suspicious strivers’ – around 15 per cent of the . population who are not sure that their efforts will bring them the right . rewards. Pledge: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured meeting staff at Royal Salford Hospital in Manchester, has vowed to protect the NHS budged and improve care services . He launched a strong attack on Mr Miliband, accusing him of ‘endless attacks on wealth but nothing about creating it, endless attacks on the British economy but nothing on dealing with the debt, nothing about how we’re going to compete in the world either’. The Liberal Democrats will be shown ‘no mercy’ at the next general election, Grant Shapps said yesterday. The Tory party chairman said he was gunning for ten Liberal Democrats on a hit-list of 40 priority seats the Tories aim to seize at the next election. Asked if those included MPs in Nick Clegg’s party, Mr Shapps replied: ‘Abso-bloody-lutely, yes.’ His comments scotch speculation of a non-aggression pact between the Coalition parties at the May 2015 election. Civil servants are facing a crackdown on trade union duties and activities undertaken during work hours. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude will announce restrictions following evidence that taxpayers are funding the salaries of trade union activists in the civil service to the tune of £36million a year. At least 6,800 civil servants are being paid from public funds to cover working hours on union duties. Ministers complain much of the officials’ time has been spent fighting the drive to cut costs at Whitehall. Hundreds who work full-time on union business are being paid from public funds. At the Tory party conference, Mr Maude will announce a cap preventing officials from spending more than half their paid time on union work. He will also ban them from taking time off to attend union conferences. Last year, 5,781 paid days off were given to civil servants to attend the events.","The Prime Minister seeks to win back blue collar workers who abandoned Labout in the 1980s .

They were heroes in the Battle of Britain and the first line of our defence against Luftwaffe bombers. But 70 years on from their Second World War heyday there are only a handful of iconic Hawker Hurricanes left. Now a rare chance for fighter plane fans to snap one up at a public auction has come about - if they have £1.7million. Iconic: The Hawker Hurricane which is up for sale at Bonhams for £1.7million. It was built in 1942 and is one of just a handful of airworthy examples in existence world-wide . The fully-restored Hurricane comes complete with its throaty Merlin engine and 12 original Browning machine guns. Tim Schofield, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'This is one of only a handful of these iconic aircraft still flying today, and is presented for sale in highly original condition.' The remarkable single-seater, one of just a handful of survivors from the 14,000 Hurricanes built, dates from 1942. It joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and is thought to have taken part in protecting convoys from German U-boats. A Hawker Hurricane formation over southern England during the Second World War . The Hawker Hurricane was a British single-seat fighter aircraft that was designed and predominantly built by Hawker Aircraft Ltd for the Royal Air Force . While the Spitfire is fondly remembered as the iconic plane that defended our shores during the Battle of Britain, it was in fact the Hawker Hurricane that downed more Nazi planes. Some 55 per cent of the 2,739 German losses were caused by the Hurricane. However, this has gone almost unrecognised due to the Spitfire's glamour, an appeal that resonated with wartime Britons as a result of successful government propaganda films. Here are some Hawker Hurricane facts: . Introduced - 1937 . Total number of planes built - 14,533 . Wingspan - 40ft . Engine - Rolls Royce Merlin 1,185hp at 21,000ft . Max speed - 339mph . Armament - 4 x 20mm cannons, 2 x 226kg bombs . Number of Hurricanes at start of Battle of Britain - 2,309 . Planes lost during Battle of Britain - 565 . The Hurricane has been restored in Battle of Britain colours, and was kept at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, Cambridgeshire. It is expected to sell for between £1.4million and £1.7million when it goes under the hammer as part of a sale of collectors’ cars and motoring memorabilia at Brooklands in Surrey on December 3. The Hurricane, the Royal Air Force’s first monoplane fighter, had its finest hour during that battle, where it shot down more enemy aircraft than its famous service partner the Spitfire. Brooklands, where the Bonhams sale will take place, has its own history with the aircraft. It was assembled and first flown in prototype form there in 1935, and altogether more than 3,000 Hurricanes were produced on site - one fifth of the total built. Struck off charge from the RCAF in 1947, it was bought by a Canadian syndicate. It was later restored to flight, making its first post-restoration flight in 1989, before being acquired by the Historic Aircraft Collection in 2002 and housed at Duxford. Other lots include the 1935 Ford used as Lance Cpl Jones’s butcher’s van in the classic TV series Dad’s Army. It is expected to go for £30,000.","Seventy years after WWII heyday, only a handful of iconic planes are left .

The sister of a Connecticut man who fatally shot his teenage son last week frantically called police to report someone was shot after she called her brother for help with someone trying to break into her house, according to 911 calls released on Friday. Police say Jeffrey Giuliano went outside with a gun at about 1 a.m. on Sept. 27 after his sister called to say someone was trying to break into her house next door in New Fairfield. Authorities say Giuliano saw a person wearing a ski mask holding a shiny object come toward him in a threatening manner and shot him. He was told later the person he killed was his 15-year-old son, Tyler. Police said the weapon was a knife. Tyler Giuliano was shot dead by his father, police said, as he tried to break into his aunt's home . Mistake: Jeffrey Giuliano opened fire on a burglary suspect next-door, only to find that he was in fact his adopted son, Tyler . 'Someone's been shot. They were trying to break into my house and I called my brother next door,' said Alexis Scocozza, Giuliano's sister, on the 911 recording. Speaking rapidly and trying to catch her breath, she said she wasn't sure if her brother was shot. 'I don't know if he was shot or not,' the sister says. 'Does your brother have a gun?' the dispatcher asks. 'I think so,' she replies. 'But I opened the front door and he screamed for me to stay inside.' Giuliano's wife also called police. Gene Zingaro, Giuliano's attorney, said this week that Giuliano believed the masked person had a gun. 'What that tells me is she did not know if there was one or two guns,' Zingaro said, referring to Giuliano's sister. 'Mr. Giuliano as we all know felt like at the time of the shooting the masked intruder not only had a gun but that he was in imminent danger.' The recordings show that 'probably five . or six' calls came in to the dispatch center from people who heard . 'multiple' shots fired, and that the police arrived in a matter of . minutes. On another call, someone says it appeared the teen might have a gunshot wound to the head. Police have said Tyler died of multiple gunshot wounds. Police are investigating the shooting. No charges have been filed and Zingaro said he doesn't expect any. Devastated Jeffery Giuliano went outside with his gun at 1am after his sister called to say someone was trying to break into her house next door in New Fairfield, about 50 miles from New York city. He saw a masked person holding a knife come toward him in a threatening manner and shot him. After calling the police Mr Giuliano . began to fear it was his son he had shot, as the boy had been missing, but . the terrible truth was not confirmed for several hours. Mr Giuliano's attorney Gene Zingaro, . who arrived at the scene shortly after the shooting, said Giuliano was . inconsolable and physically ill - crying and vomiting. Giuliano and his wife adopted Tyler . and his sister about four years ago. The children's biological father . was heading to prison, and the children would have gone into an . orphanage if the couple, who had three other children, had not adopted . them, Zingaro said. The father and son shared a love of . music and the Civilian Air Patrol, in which Tyler served as a cadet and . enjoyed flying gliders and small aircraft, Zingaro said. Support: Visitors arrive at the home of Jeffrey Giuliano to offer their . support. The family's attorney said they remain utterly devastated and . still struggling to comprehend what had happened . Investigation: A State Trooper emerges from the backyard of the Giuliano . home. Their attorney said he did not believe any charges would be . brought against the family . Mr Zingaro said the family were 'not well' and were struggling to comprehend what had happened and were filled with questions. He said: 'Their family is hurting. They've been broken in half by this unspeakable tragedy, which really is . three tragedies all in one.' 'The family has literally hundreds of . questions as to what Tyler was doing, why he was wearing what he was and . why he was carrying what he was,' Zingaro said. 'Those questions will probably go unanswered forever.' Giuliano and his wife cooperated . immediately with authorities, allowing them to search their home without . a warrant and giving a sworn statement, Zingaro said. He called it a . justifiable shooting and said Giuliano had a permit to carry the gun. Mr Zingaro said he did not believe his client would be charged with any type of offense, weapon or otherwise. State police said the shooting . happened after Jeffrey Giuliano got a call from his sister next door . saying that someone might be trying to break into her home in their . neighborhood of attractive colonial-style houses. 'Giuliano grabbed a handgun and went outside to investigate, troopers said. He confronted someone in a ski mask and opened fire when the person came at him with something shiny in his hand, police said. 'When police officers arrived, Tyler . was lying dead in the driveway with a knife in his hand, and his father, . in a T-shirt and shorts, was sitting on the grass.

New Fairfield First Selectman John . Hodge provided a statement that was read on behalf of the Giuliano . family at the memorial service, thanking the community for its support. 'So many people have rallied behind this family in a way that touches our hearts and gives us strength,' the statement said. One classmate said many students were baffled by what happened. 'I just thought it was so weird when I . heard because I knew Tyler, not very well, but he was just a sweet . person and he always made everyone laugh. I met him in the chorus room, . actually, and he just wasn't the type to do what happened,' said Erin . Pallas, 16. 'So it didn't make sense to us. It doesn't make sense to the . student body.'

According to the New York Post, the casting notice reads ‘Seeking LEG ONLY, MALE AMPUTEES’ on an Irish casting website posted this week. Interested actors must send ‘a clear description regarding where your limb is missing e.g. at knee, at ankle, etc.’ It continues: ‘You must be OK and comfortable with filming a scene within the context of a battle where your leg has been injured. ‘Prosthetic makeup will be applied as though your leg has newly been severed. ‘We understand that this is not for everyone, so please only apply if you are happy to participate.’ The climactic scene, if staged according to the novels, will require hundreds of extras including musicians.

Tom Amery is supplying the UK's Michelin-starred restaurants with wasabi stems - used to make a hot paste traditionally eaten with sushi - after successfully managing to grow the notoriously difficult to cultivate plant. The Dorset-based watercress farmer's customers now include Raymond Blanc after his plant, which is grown in a top-secret location, began to bear fruit. Hot demand: Farmer Tom Amery, seen holding a wasabi rhizome, is supplying Britain's Michelin-starred restaurants with the super-hot stems . Growing wasabi, which is similar to cabbage and horseradish, is a difficult and painstaking process as it requires precise water flow and light conditions. The plant also takes two years to harvest. It grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan, but until now has only been available in the UK in powder or paste form from supermarkets. Now London's The Ledbury - which was this week named as the UK's best restaurant - and Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir in Oxfordshire are among the exclusive eateries lining up to buy fresh wasabi from Mr Amery, who runs a watercress farm near Bere Regis in Dorset. Rhizome: The oriental superfood is now flourishing at a top-secret location in Dorset . The farmer, who tried a variety of growing methods and waited two years to learn if any had been successful, has kept the location of his crop under wraps to avoid the attention of potential competitors . When grated down the stem - or rhizome - is used to make the wasabi paste usually served with sushi, but Mr Amery said his customers are using the plants to experiment with wasabi by adding it to sauces and meat and fish dishes. 'Because it takes two years to grow we . had to wait to see if we had been successful, which is probably why it . hasn’t been successful here before,' he said. 'Until . we started selling the wasabi we had to keep it very secret to protect . our rights and also because we weren’t sure what the results were going . to be. 'We are now producing . about 100 rhizomes a week and selling them to chefs and restaurants who . have been experimenting with ways of using it in their food.' The rhizomes sell for between £8 and £45 depending on their size. Mr Amery, who is managing director of The Watercress Company and new firm The Wasabi Company said: 'The company has been working with watercress for about 120 years and wanted to try a new crop. We . knew about wasabi and wanted to try it when we discovered that the . paste and powder that you buy in shops has less than 15 per cent of . actual wasabi in it. 'It was difficult to research how to grow it because no one has been successful in Europe before so we tried different methods. 'We . practised and came up with our own system based on the sawa method used . in Japan, which is where the wasabi is grown in water on gravel. 'I . think it could take off as a product that individual people will want . to buy as the interest in Japanese food and sushi is steadily gaining . popularity. 'It could even . be grown personally in back gardens in the future, not only does it have . a distinct flavour but the plant is quite pretty too,' the farmer . added.

The blood-soaked corkscrew a Portuguese underwear model used to cut off his elderly lover's testicles in a glitzy New York City hotelroom was shown to horrified jurors yesterday, in the 22-year-old's murder trial. Renato Seabra confessed to using the corkscrew to castrate his rich 65-year-old fashion journalist boyfriend Carlos Castro in the January 2011 attack, and prosecutors claim he also used it to gouge at the old man's face. NYPD detective Ricardo Yanis described to jurors in Manhattan Supreme Court the sickening blood-splattered crime scene at the InterContinental hotel in Times Square, where the bottle opener was found along with a cryptic note. Pictured together: Renato Seabra, pictured left, is on trial for castrating and murdering his elderly lover Carlos Castro, right, last year . According to The New York Post, . detectives spent 13 hours combing the horrific castration murder scene . for evidence and came across the corkscrew laying on a white hotel . slipper next to a message, written in Portuguese. 'Behind... but good person -- few times,' the note read. Mr . Yanis also showed jurors a broken and bloody wine glass they found in . the hotel room and described how the crime scene was a mess of . blood-soaked towels, discarded laundry and Mr Castro's testicles. 'Here . you have a white blanket cover, and the black sneakers, and the . decedent's testicle on the white blanket,' Mr Yanis testified, later . pointing out the other testicle, sitting on the carpet next to the . room's bed as if it had been thrown there. Mr . Seabra's defense lawyers say the carnage is evidence the young model . was insane when he struck out, and that statements to a psychologist . explain that the 22-year-old thought he was saving his lover by ridding . him of the 'evil' and 'demons' within, The Post reported. Weapon: NYPD detectives showed jurors the corkscrew, pictured, that they found covered in blood in the hotel room . Glass: Detectives also found a bloody, broken wine glass, pictured, in the carnage . He . even slit his own wrists and held Mr Castro's severed testicles to his . hands to 'harness their power' in the five hours he was in the room with . the body, the model explained to his doctors. On Thursday, a hotel security guard . who discovered the fashion journalist's naked and mutilated corpse . testified that the hotel room he was murdered in was drenched in blood. Mr Seabra and Mr Castro were on vacation at the InterContinental Hotel in Manhattan last year, when the slaying took place. Wilfredo . Gonzalez described the crime scene to jurors, saying: 'There was all . this blood on the floor, towels all over the place, glass. There was . just damage all over the place. 'Then I opened the door further. And I saw the body. He was naked and there was blood around the groin area and his face.' Mr Seabra is accused of bludgeoning, . strangling and castrating his 65-year-old lover with a corkscrew and . wearing his testicles as a bracelet. Crime scene: NYPD detectives spent 13 hours combing the carnage for evidence after Renato Seabra, pictured, attacked his lover Carlos Castro in a New York hotel . Defense attorneys are arguing the . crime was so perverse that the young model was insane when acting out . the frenzied attack. Prosecutors are arguing it was a cold-blooded murder carried out after Castro tried to end the three-month relationship. 'So, it was clear to you that he was deceased?' prosecutor Maxine . Rosenthal asked the guard. 'Why was that clear to you?' 'Because of the amount of blood that was there, and the blood that was . there was very dark,' Mr Gonzalez said. 'Like it was sitting there awhile.' The taxi driver who took what he called a 'calm and normal' Mr Seabra to the hospital also testified yesterday, according to The New York Post. Despite the model's claims to doctors . that he walked around the city with his lover's testicles touching . members of the public to 'cure' them of demons and AIDS, the cab driver . said there was no such talk of this when he saw him and he did not seem . insane. Aspiring model: The defense claims that Mr Seabra, 22, had a psychotic break when he murdered his older lover while on vacation in New York . 'So in love': A friend of Carlos Castro (right) said he had lavished his younger lover Renato Seabra (left) with gifts . before the younger man allegedly castrated him in a New York hotel room . 'He told me to take him to a good hospital,' Senegalese native Cheikh . Bbacke told jurors, adding that Mr Seabra then made a bizarre inquiry into where New York . City keeps its waste. Earlier this week, Wanda Pires, a . close friend of Mr Castro, said her friend described the relationship as . 'the best thing that ever happened in his life'. Ms Pires said Mr Castro had given the . aspiring model free rein with his credit card and had planned trips to . shopping malls, casinos and basketball games during their vacation, . according to the New York Post. The ambitious younger man was also hoping to find modelling work through a Manhattan agency. Ms . Pires added that the couple, who had been together since October 2010, . were so in love they would even feed each other over meals. She added: 'Every time they went to eat they were sharing food with each other… very friendly, very happy.' However . according to Pires' testimony, Mr Seabra taunted Mr Castro by trying to get . the phone numbers of young women on the day before the murder. Murder trial: Defense lawyers for Seabra have claimed that he suffered a psychotic break whereas the prosecution said that he strangled and mutilated Castro out of rage . The relationship between the two soured when Mr Castro later caught Mr Seabra going out with a group of young women. On January 7, 2011, tensions came to a head when Mr Seabra and Mr Castro got into a . fight over the older man's plans to send his lover home, thus signalling . the end of their whirlwind romance. Ms . Pires told jurors that she spoke to Mr Castro on the morning he died and . he said the couple had fought all night and Mr Seabra had declared he was . no longer gay. The prosecution hope to debunk the defense's claim that Mr Seabra fell into an hour-long psychotic . fit when he bludgeoned Mr Castro with a TV, strangled him and then cut off . his testicles with a corkscrew while he was still alive. District Attorney Maxine Rosenthal earlier . described Mr Seabra as a hot-headed, gold-digger who realized that his free . ride was over and killed Mr Castro out of anger, not insanity. Defense attorney Rubin Sinins told jurors last week during opening testimony that Mr Seabra had a psychotic fit when he cut off his lover's testicles and slit his own wrists. 'He put one [testicle] on each wrist,' Mr Sinins told the court. 'He did this for his protection. He could also . harness the power. 'He wandered the streets of Manhattan, touching . people, because he had the power to cure people from AIDS, because he . had the power to cure them.' Luxury: Castro and Seabra had a huge fight while staying at the high-end InterContinental Hotel in Manhattan which ended in Castro's brutal death . The lawyer went on, telling the jury . that Mr Seabra explained to police the day after the murder that ‘he . believed Mr Castro's testicles were demons, and that by pulling them . out everything would be right with the world'. The lawyer asked the jury to acquit . Mr Seabra by reason of insanity, with the possibility of being committed to . a psychiatric facility. ‘He was in another world,’ Mr Sinins told . jurors. ‘He was deluded into thinking that he was a special messenger . from God, on a mission to make the world a better place.’ However, . the prosecution implored the panel not to believe the psychotic episode . story, insisting that there was nothing in the 21-year-old’ medical . history to suggest even mild mental illness. Court papers presented by prosecutors . described a statement police said Mr Seabra gave after the January 7 death . of Mr Castro while the two were on holiday in Manhattan. The account depicted an argument in a . hotel room that turned vicious and escalated into a prolonged hour-long . frenzy, with Mr Seabra first choking his companion, then stabbing him with a . corkscrew in his face and groin. Mr Seabra . also admitted to hitting Mr Castro on the head with a monitor . and stamping on his face while wearing shoes, the papers said. After the attack Mr Seabra told police, he showered, put on a suit and left. The 21-year-old, Mr Seabra, was a . contestant in 2010 on a Portuguese television show called A Procura Do . Sonho, or 'Pursuit Of A Dream', which hunts for modelling talent. Although . he did not win the show, he gained a modelling contract with an agency . founded by designer Fatima Lopes, who developed the show and was a . judge. The trial continues on Monday.","Defense claim aspiring model Renato Seabra, 22, had psychotic break when he bludgeoned, strangled and slashed off lover's testicles with corkscrew .

Warpath: Syrian tanks, seen from the Turkish village of Saribuk in Hatay province drive along the border, towards the town of Darkush where heavy clashes are going on between rebel fighters and government troops . Davutoglu turned up the pressure as . Turkey's prime minister sharply criticized the UN Security Council for . its failure to agree on decisive steps to end the 19-month civil war in . Syria. Recep Tayyip Erdogan told an international conference in Istanbul that the world was witnessing a humanitarian tragedy in Syria. 'If we wait for one or two of the permanent members ... then the future of Syria will be in danger,' said Erdogan, according to an official translator. He added: 'The council has not intervened in the human tragedy that has been going on in Syria for 20 months, despite all our efforts.

Syria denounced the move as air piracy, while Russia said the cargo was radar parts that complied with international law. Russia and China - two of the five permanent members of the Security Council - have vetoed resolutions that sought to put concerted pressure on Damascus to end the conflict and agree to a political transition. President Bashar al-Assad's army were reported to have clashed with rebel units on several fronts around the country.

A vandal who scrawled on a postbox painted gold in honour of a 15-year-old Paralympic hero has been spared jail. Nathan Geary daubed his tag ‘nopom’ on the postbox which was painted after Josef Craig won the gold in the Men's S7 400m freestyle at the London Games. Craig, 15, twice broke the world record during the Paralympic Games to win gold in the 400 metres S7 freestyle. Not so brave now: Nathan Geary, 21, from Jarrow, South Tyneside, scrawled graffiti on a gold post box that honoured a Paralympian . He swam . four minutes 42.81 seconds to beat the mark of 4mins 45.79 secs he set in the . morning's heat, winning by 3.41 seconds from China's Pan Shiyun. But the postbox to honour his remarkable achievements was ruined by Geary, who continued on a rampage of vandalism. The 21-year-old also vandalised other areas in Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, including the nearby Tunnel Club, cars and houses during his graffiti spree on September 12. He pleaded guilty to three counts of criminal damage at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court earlier this week and asked for a further six to be taken into account. Paralympic swimming hero Josef Craig, 15, who smashed his own world record on the way to a gold medal in the 400m S7 Freestyle final, has had the gold post-box erected in his honour in his home town of Jarrow, South Tyneside . Geary has been told he 'brought shame on the nation' at South Tyneside Magistrates, where he pleaded guilty to three charges of criminal damage . Geary, of Jarrow, was sentenced on . Friday when he was given a 12-month community order with supervision and . 100 hours unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £1,000 compensation. Chairman of the bench Russell Hewitson, told him: ‘We were thinking of whether you should get a custodial sentence, but after careful consideration we decided against it. 'Criminal damage in the community cannot be tolerated any time but this involved the post box as well. 'You showed a complete lack of respect for someone from this area who carried out a great achievement.’ The 21-year-old caused more than £1,100 of damage in the spree, which happened just days after the postbox was painted for the swimmer, Team GB's youngest gold medallist, of Primrose, Jarrow. Claire Wright, prosecuting, said: ""He was caught on CCTV outside Wilkinson Court and outside the Viking Precinct. 'He was with a small black dog and had a fishing rod. 'It showed him writing on the postbox, doors, cars, and his own building before going inside.' Mrs Wright said that when police went to the building to find the culprit, Geary was the only one with a dog that matched the one seen on CCTV. The court heard that Geary, who has a two-year-old daughter, has no previous convictions for criminal damage. Rachel Comb, defending, said: 'He appreciates how stupid and mindless these acts are. 'It is something he will have to live with for an extremely long time, and he is deeply sorry.' Speaking after the caused, Geary said that he feels terrible for what he has done and is going to write a letter to Josef to apologise.","Nathan Geary daubed his tag on the postbox after Josef Craig won the gold in the Men's S7 400m freestyle .

A convicted murderer has avoided deportation from Britain by claiming it would breach his right to a family life. Cesar Castillo Torres fathered four children after fleeing to the UK from Honduras when he was accused of killing the nephew of the country’s former president. He was found guilty in his absence and moves to deport him began when he was traced to the North East of England. Convicted: Cesar Castillo Torres (pictured left in Newcastle ) fled to the UK when he was accused of killing Gabriel Gaborit, the nephew of the former president (pictured right) But the 38-year-old has won his appeal to stay on the grounds that it would be against his human rights to kick him out. Last night the family of victim Gabriel Gaborit condemned the decision. Mr Gaborit’s brother Gustavo, 34, said: ‘I’m horrified to discover Torres is a free man and cannot be deported to face justice. He is a very bad man,  a convicted murderer, and  he should be in prison serving his sentence. ‘I understand that people have human rights, but justice must come first. Torres is an extremely dangerous man and the idea that the British Government cannot deport him is unbelievable. ‘He should be locked up, not enjoying his life in the UK. Our family have been devastated by the murder. We are not bitter people seeking revenge, but we do ask for justice to be done.’ Honduran police say Torres shot 23-year-old Mr Gaborit in October 1996. He was arrested two years later but escaped custody by dressing as a female nurse during a visit to hospital and fled the country. In 2002 he was tried in his absence and acquitted, but in 2004 prosecutors challenged the acquittal. Honduran authorities insist father-of-six Torres was then convicted of murder in a retrial and sentenced in his absence  to 18 years. In a further twist, Torres was said to have launched an appeal against conviction but, although the court’s 2006 ruling is unknown, this week the police officer in charge of the investigation told The Mail on Sunday that Torres remained a convicted murderer. It is understood the killer arrived in England in 1998 and moved around to avoid detection, living in London, Luton, Hull and Newcastle. Family: Former Honduran president Farfael Callejas and his wife Norma . His wife Indra and their eldest two children also came here and the couple have since had four more children. Interpol issued a Red Notice requesting his capture and in 2009 he was traced to the North East, where he was arrested. Two weeks after his arrest Torres claimed asylum, but the Home Office rejected his case and tried to deport him. The killer, however, appealed the decision and an immigration judge decided he was entitled to remain here under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, which states he has a right to a family life. This decision was then appealed – unsuccessfully – by the Home Office at the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber. Torres’s victim was the nephew by marriage of Rafael Leonardo Callejas, Honduran president from 1990 to 1994. Mr Gaborit’s family said he was shot 11 times – eight times with a .38 revolver and three times with a shotgun. They claimed Torres had a professional relationship with the victim and the murder motive was financial. Police said they found the handgun in Torres’s car and several witnesses placed him  at the scene. Although Torres is the only person convicted of the murder, detectives believe there was more than one killer. Agent Gladys Borden, of the Honduran Police’s Investigation Unit, said: ‘This was a particularly brutal murder. Torres should be here in Honduras serving his sentence. He should not be a free man.’ Torres now lives with his  family in the top-floor flat of a converted terrace house in Newcastle’s West End. Dressed in loose-fitting tracksuit bottoms and a black hooded top, he said: ‘I like it here in England. It is a good country and I have even got used to the weather.’ When asked if he had fled Honduras after committing murder, he said: ‘No, that is a lie. I left because the police in Honduras kept shooting at me. ‘I will talk to you about all of this but I have to talk to my solicitor to make sure it’s OK to do so first. ‘I would love to give my side of the story, please contact my solicitor because I’m not sure what I will say or not.’ Charlie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover and Deal, who has tabled a Bill to replace the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights, said: ‘It’s obvious that he should be sent back to Honduras on the next available plane. The fact that he has created a family in the UK while on the run should not be an excuse to avoid justice.’ The UK Border Agency said: ‘We are extremely disappointed with the court’s decision. We do not believe this individual needs or deserves refuge in this country. We are lodging a challenge against the decision and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment any further.’ The Mail on Sunday was unable to reach Torres’s immigration solicitor.","Cesar Castillo Torres fathered four children after fleeing from Honduras .

The black and white feline, named Lilly, was just two weeks away from giving birth when she was thrown in the tar which burned her skin and solidified on her fur, severely restricting her movements. It took groomers three hours to remove the tar with a special heavy duty cleaner after she was spotted by a concerned member of the public hobbling along a street in Nazeing, Essex. Cruelly thrown in: Lilly, a moggy who is heavily pregnant, was dropped into a vat of hot tar before she was spotted hobbling along a street . The tar had burnt large sections of her skin and caused clumps of fur to drop off her body. It had also collected on her legs making her paws appear they were double their normal size. Her entire belly and legs were caked in tar which had also collected dozens of leaves, twigs and debris. The cat was taken to animal groomers Mister Groom in Harlow, were staff used Swarfega cleaner to remove the tar. Amazingly Lilly has made a full recovery, been returned to her owners, who did not wish to be named. It is hoped she will still have a healthy litter of kittens. Heavy duty cleaner: Groomers spent three hours removing the tar which had solidified on her skin causing clumps of fur to drop off her body. Her paws appeared double in size because tar had collected on her legs . Linda Forsyth, who runs Mister Groom, said it was the ‘worst thing she had ever seen done to an animal’. She said: ‘Whoever did this to the poor thing deserves to have it done to them. I can’t understand how anyone could be so cruel. ‘I could not believe the state of the poor thing when it was brought into us. ‘The tar had solidified on its body and it could barely move, it was just meowing in pain and distress. ‘We have been in business for 30 years and I have never seen anything like it.’ Expert Groomer Catherine Tranter was one of the workers who spent hours arduously cleaning the poor creature. She said: ‘It was just so bad. I have never seen anything like it.

While fears continue over the melting Arctic ice caps climate change has actually increased the sea ice cover in the Antarctic, according to the first direct evidence from the region. Scientists from Natural Environment Research Council and NASA marked changes to Antarctic sea ice drift that have occurred over the last 20 years in response to changing winds. Unlike the dramatic losses reported in the Arctic at the opposite pole in the Antarctic sea ice cover has increased, according to maps created in NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory using over 5 million individual daily ice motion measurements captured over a period of 19 years by four US Defense Meteorological satellites. Scroll down for video . The British Antarctic Survey and Nasa believe wind in behind the rise in ice levels in the Antarctic . The new maps show wind direction (top) and correlation between winds and ice motion (bottom) These maps show, for the first time, the long-term changes in sea ice drift around Antarctica and reveal the complexities of climate change. The study, published in Nature Geoscience, shows for the first time how winds in the Antarctic cause the change in sea ice cover. Lead author, Dr Paul Holland of NERC's British Antarctic Survey, said: 'Until now these changes in ice drift were only speculated upon, using computer models of Antarctic winds. 'This study of direct satellite observations shows the complexity of climate change. 'The total Antarctic sea-ice cover is increasing slowly, but individual regions are actually experiencing much larger gains and losses that are almost offsetting each other overall. 'We now know that these regional changes are caused by changes in the winds, which in turn affect the ice cover through changes in both ice drift and air temperature. 'The changes in ice drift also suggest large changes in the ocean surrounding Antarctica, which is very sensitive to the cold and salty water produced by sea-ice growth. 'Sea ice is constantly on the move; . around Antarctica the ice is blown away from the continent by strong . northward winds. Since 1992 this ice drift has changed. 'In some areas the export of ice away from Antarctica has doubled, while in others it has decreased significantly.' Sea ice plays a key role in the global environment - reflecting heat from the sun and providing a habitat for marine life. September 26, 2012, when ice covered more of the Southern Ocean than at any other time in the satellite record. Increase: At the end of the southern winter in September, ice covered 7.51million square miles of sea ¿ more than at any time since records began in 1979. This image shows an icebreaker in the sea . At both poles sea ice cover is at its minimum during late summer. However, during the winter freeze in . Antarctica this ice cover expands to an area roughly twice the size of . Europe. Ranging in thickness from less than a metre to several metres, . the ice insulates the warm ocean from the frigid atmosphere above. The . new research also helps explain why observed changes in the amount of . sea-ice cover are so different in the two Polar Regions. The . Arctic has experienced dramatic ice losses in recent decades while the . overall ice extent in the Antarctic has increased slightly. While Actic ice levels (above) are at record levels, Antarctic levels are rising due to wind, researchers said today . However, this small Antarctic increase is actually the result of much larger regional increases and decreases, which are now shown to be caused by wind-driven changes. In places, increased northward winds have caused the sea-ice cover to expand outwards from Antarctica. The Arctic Ocean is surrounded by land, so changed winds cannot cause Arctic ice to expand in the same way. NASA's Dr Ron Kwok said: 'The Antarctic sea ice cover interacts with the global climate system very differently than that of the Arctic, and these results highlight the sensitivity of the Antarctic ice coverage to changes in the strength of the winds around the continent.'There has been contrasting climate change observed across the Antarctic in recent decades. The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed as much as anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere, while East Antarctica has shown little change or even a small cooling around the coast. The new research improves understanding of present and future climate change. It is important to distinguish between the Antarctic Ice Sheet - glacial ice - which is losing volume, and Antarctic sea ice - frozen seawater - which is expanding, the researchers claim. Researcher Ted Maksym is on the R.V. Aurora Australis (right) in the Antarctic conducting studies of the ice. He is with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. At well past midnight in Antarctica, where it's about 3 degrees . Fahrenheit (minus 16 Celsius), Maksym describes in a rare ship-to-shore . telephone call from the what this extra ice means in terms of climate . change. And what it's like to be out studying it for two months, with the nearest city 1,500 miles (2,415 kilometers) away. 'It's only you and the penguins,' he says. 'It's really a strikingly beautiful and stark landscape. 'Sometimes it's even an eerie kind of landscape.' Scientists on the cruise with Maksym are spending eight to 12 hours a day on the ice. Cracks in sea ice can form at . any time, and a few days ago a sudden fissure stranded a team of . scientists until an inflatable bridge rescued them. 'It's a treacherous landscape,' Vaughan says.","The study shows for the first time how winds in the Antarctic cause .

Because of the ongoing investigation, the child was held by a police deputy until a social services worker arrived on the scene in the early evening. Suspect: Grigoriy Bukhantsov, the victim's brother-in-law and uncle to the two slain children, was brought in for questioning Wednesday morning . 'Many of us have children as well. It's extremely traumatic… We're all human,' County Sheriff's spokesman Sergeant Jason Ramos told the Sacramento Bee. Police have since caught the suspect, Grigoriy Bukhantsov, the brother of the children's father, and in turn the brother-in-law and uncle of the victims. 'We had developed information pretty early and the investigation caused us to focus on him,' Sergeant Ramos told MailOnline. He was arrested at a Denny's restaurant after police spotted the car he had stolen from his victims' house. 'Inside the restaurant, officers contacted 19 year-old Grigoriy Bukhantsov, who was identified as the brother-in-law to the female adult victim and uncle to the victim children. Bukhantsov was detained without incident,' police said in the press release. The 19-year-old 'had a very strained relationship with several members of the family.' Investigators are still searching for the motive. Grigoriy was taken into police custody Wednesday morning for questioning over the murder of his sister-in-law Alina Bukhantsov and two of her three children, whose names have not been released. Unexpected: Alina, right, and Denis, left, married in May 2008 and now Denis' estranged brother Grigoriy is in police custody over the three murders . Discovery: Denis is thought to be a student and he found his dead family members when he arrived home Tuesday afternoon. He was the one to notify police . Police said that the bodies of the . three victims were all found in the same vicinity, while the surviving . baby was found in a rear bedroom of the house further away from the . scene. The first clue that the murderer was . someone known to the family was the there were no signs of forced entry, . leading investigators to believe that Alina knew her killer. Victim: Alina Bukhantsov (right) was killed in her home on Tuesday, and is seen here with one of her three children though it is unclear which . When her husband Denis arrived at the . home . from school, he went inside and realized that something was wrong. He . then rushed to a neighbors house because he did not know if the intruder . was still in the house. Officers . found the 'extremely distraught' man in front of his home while the . six-month-old infant lay crying in a crib in a room at the back. The mother, who was in her 20s, her three-year-old girl and her two-year-old boy suffered 'a lot of trauma' prior to their death, according to Sergeant Ramos. The family is from the Ukraine and it . is unclear how long they have lived in America, but they have . definitely been here for several years. A . neighbor told The Sacramento Bee that she had gone to high school with . Alina, saying that she was shocked by the scene because the family . 'didn't look like trouble people'. Sergeant Ramos . would not reveal the details of the death but the father and neighbour . were detained for questioning, although they have not been identified as . suspects. 'This is . somebody who confronted a family inside their homes and took their lives . very violently. It's shocking, even to veteran law enforcement,' he . said. Defenceless: A member of child protection services carries the six-month-old away from the scene of the triple homicide . Response: Officers arrived on the scene after the husband notified neighbors . Hopeful future: Two kind workers smile and play with the helpless child as confusion reigns at the murder scene . Senseless crime: Friends and relatives unite in their grief and shock at the terrible deed that left behind only the baby and its father . The . crime scene was so shocking that chaplains were called to comfort the . first responders who were shaken by the extent of the violence. Authorities are questioning the family's neighbors in Rancho Cordova, 15 miles east of Sacramento. They are also asking the public for help look for the family's white 2005 Chrysler Town and Country minivan with the licence plate number 6LFY276, which police say was stolen from the home.

Several reporters said that officers exiting the home were visibly shaken. Sgt Ramos said officers 'rarely see' a crime of this magnitude. 'We're looking into everything; we have a mom and two kids dead,' he said. The family was said to be religious, and neighbor Sandra Sida said that she frequently saw them dressed up for church. 'I've never seen them angry,' she said.","Children's father discovered the bodies at the California home .

William Hague will tomorrow  launch a worldwide network of  British Commonwealth embassies to rival the emergence of the EU as a foreign superpower. The Foreign Secretary is in  Canada where he will sign an agreement to open joint UK-Canadian  diplomatic missions abroad. He also hopes Australia and New Zealand will join the initiative whereby the four countries will pool their resources to extend their combined influence on world affairs. Hitting back: Williams Hague hopes to secure Britain's place as a world power . The move by Eurosceptic Mr Hague is seen as a counter to the EU’s fast-expanding European External Action Service, which is setting up offices in the US and other major countries. It is seen by some UK diplomats as a direct threat to Britain’s standing  as a major world power. Now Mr Hague is hitting back with plans to increase the number of British embassies by teaming up with the three Commonwealth allies. Superpower: The Foreign secretary wants to create a worldwide network . In remote nations where Canada  but not Britain has an embassy,  or vice versa, they will share the embassy. Similar arrangements are expected to include Australia and New Zealand. Mr Hague said: ‘As David Cameron said when addressing the Canadian parliament last year, “We are two nations, but under one Queen and united by one set of values.” ‘We have stood shoulder to shoulder from the great wars of the last century to fighting terrorists in Afghanistan and supporting Arab Spring nations like Libya and Syria. ‘We are first cousins. So it is natural that we look to link up our embassies with Canada’s in places where that suits both countries. It will give us a bigger reach abroad for our businesses and people for less cost.’ One British diplomat put it more bluntly: ‘For all the grandiose talk of European unity, we have so much more in common with many Commonwealth countries than the EU – and not just the English language. ‘There is a saying in the British  diplomatic corps that “the French want to do us over, the Germans want to lord it over us and the Italians are all over the place”. ‘We would never dream of trusting them with intelligence secrets, but we share everything with the Canadians, Aussies and Kiwis. ‘Brussels can extend its diplomatic reach – well, so can we. The EU is so burdened by history it doesn’t know what it wants to do and is hopeless at speaking with one voice. ‘We Brits know who we are, who our real friends are, and between us we have been a rather good influence on the world in the past century.’","Will team up with the three Commonwealth allies .

Millionaire businessman Jeremy Paxton has had a ruling banning him from using a rotating helipad in his garden overturned . A millionaire water ski champion is to be allowed to use a rotating helicopter landing pad in his garden after overturning a council ban. Businessman Jeremy Paxton was furious when Reading Councillors ruled that he could not use the pad in the grounds of his mansion to protect a nearby willow tree and prevent noise and pollution irritating his neighbours. Mr Paxton, who became Britain's first private airborne Fire Ranger last year after volunteering with Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service, said that the ban had left him unable to do anything with the pad other than play table tennis on it, dine on it and use it for 'recreational sumo wrestling'. Taxpayers will now have to foot the bill for Reading Borough Council's legal costs and Mr Paxton's own £30,000 expenses after the ruling was overturned on appeal. The pilot built the revolving pad, which is covered with turf, in the grounds of his luxury home situated on the bank of the River Thames in Caversham, Berkshire, so that he could take off into the wind, but did so without planning permission and had to apply to the council retrospectively. He was granted permission by the authority's planning committee but it said that he could not use the turntable for his chopper in case a protected willow tree was damaged. Mr Paxton said: 'It seems bonkers that I can land anywhere I like in my garden, but the council wants to say I cannot land on a flush mounted turntable that allows the helicopter to be swung around. 'The council says that landing on the turntable might damage the a tree, but I could land on that spot if the turntable was not there. 'Would I really want to land too close to a tree in a helicopter? 'It all seems daft and childish nonsense to me and yet another appeal to waste public funds.' In his decision report planning inspector Peter Bird described the ban as 'unnecessary', 'perverse' and 'unreasonable'. Mr Bird pointed out the Mr Paxton has permission from the Civil Aviation Authority to take off or land at his property up to 14 times a week. Mr Paxton, said that this is the third planning appeal he has lodged against Reading Borough Council . Jeremy Paxton, pictured with his helicopter, has permission from the Civil Aviation Authority to take off or land at his home 14 times a week . Mr Paxton insisted his immediate neighbours do not have a problem with the helicopter. He said he does not fly it early in the morning or late at night and only uses around half of the permitted take-offs and landings. The millionaire, who owns the Lower Mill Estate of luxury homes in the Cotswolds and often commutes to work in his executive Mcdonnell Douglas 500e helicopter, said: 'It's a great shame, this is the third appeal in two years they have put me through for applications that really are so benign. 'The first was for solar panels, and we again won costs, and the second was for some gates. The thing I find most galling is it's such a waste of public money and I don't get all the money.' Planning committee chairman Pete Ruhemann said: 'There have been particular problems on this site with retrospective applications, the planning application only coming in after development has been completed. 'I would urge Mr Paxton to do as other land-owners do and discuss what he wants to do with planning officers before submitting an application, and then doing the work if and when that application was approved. That would generate real savings both for himself and for the council.' The rotating helipad is in the grounds of Mr Paxton's Caversham home, situated on the banks of the River Thames in Berkshire, which he calls Ballihoo .","Jeremy Paxton built the rotating landing pad in his garden so that his helicopter can take off in to the wind before applying for planning permission .

'Unjustifiable': Pressure is mounting on George Entwistle to hand back some of his £450,000 pay-off . Failed director general George Entwistle's 'obscene' £450,000 pay-off was signed off by a BBC Trust boss as she watched Strictly Come Dancing, it has been revealed. Lord Patten telephoned his deputy Diana Coyle during the hit show on Saturday evening and they agreed that Entwistle should get double what he was entitled to if he did the 'honourable' thing and quit. After the £1.3m deal was done, which also included a £877,000 pension pot, Ms Coyle went back to watching dancers like Denise Van Outen, Fern Britton, Kimberley Walsh, Michael Vaughan and Louis Smith, the BBC Trust confirmed to MailOnline. Entwistle's pay deal has caused huge controversy and the admission the offer was sealed in this way could cause more damage to the BBC. 'Diane Coyle was consulted on Saturday evening as a member of the Remuneration Committee.  During the broadcast of Strictly Come . Dancing she took a call from the Chairman for this and then returned to . watching television afterwards,' a BBC Trust spokesperson said. 'There was not a formal meeting of the Remuneration Committee but each member of the Committee was consulted.' Ms Coyle is married to BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones and was economics editor for The Independent for eight years. Meanwhile the BBC was locked in an extraordinary standoff with Parliament and Downing Street last night over the ‘unacceptable’ £450,000 double pay-off to the former director general. MPs on all sides voiced outrage over a ‘reward for failure’ as it emerged Mr Entwistle had been paid double the cash he was entitled to in order to ‘conclude matters quickly’. Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman urged Mr Entwistle to give up half his pay-off – £225,000 – saying it was impossible to justify. Deal: BBC Trust vice chairman Diana Coyle was called by her boss Lord Patten during Strictly - they agreed on Entwistle's deal and then she went back to watching the show . Strictly business: Fern Britton stunned the judges with her routine on Saturday - an episode watched by Diana Coyle as she helped agree George Entwistle's pay deal . Strictly one payoff: Diane Coyle, Lord Patten's deputy, sent this Twitter picture as she prepared to watch reality show Strictly Come Dancing and sign off former director general George Entwistle's £450,000 pay off . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also said it was difficult to justify, saying today: 'Mr Entwistle was offered this money, he did not need to take it.' He told ITV's Daybreak that it was 'up to the BBC to justify, as Lord Patten sought to, why they took the decision'. Mr Entwistle resigned on Saturday night, saying he was doing the ‘honourable’ thing by taking responsibility for Newsnight’s disastrous investigation into child abuse. Royal Opera House chief executive Tony Hall is said to be the early favourite to replace George Entwistle as the next director general. Hall joined the BBC as a trainee after graduating from Oxford and helped launch BBC Parliament, Radio 5 Live and by 34 was editing the 9 O'Clock News. He then went on to hold several senior executive roles before going to the Royal Opera House in 2001 - two years after a failed application to be director general. He did not apply last time but an insider said he is 'respected inside and outside the BBC' and could be ideal to steady the ship. His pay-off came after just 54 days in the job, making it worth more than £8,000 for every day he served. He also leaves with an £877,000 pension pot. But Culture Secretary Maria Miller told MPs it was ‘not right’ for Mr Entwistle to be handed such a massive pay-off and urged him to ‘consider whether it is appropriate for him to accept those payments’. Mrs Miller, who invited the National . Audit Office to investigate the deal said it was a ‘reward for failure’, . adding: ‘The circumstances of his departure make it hard to justify the . level of severance money agreed.’ Ministers . say they are powerless to block the payment but hope to shame Mr . Entwistle into giving up part of it, as they did with the vast pension . owed to Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin. A Downing Street source said the . payment was ‘hard to justify’, adding that it was now ‘a matter for . George Entwistle’s conscience’. Earlier, . the BBC chairman Lord Patten claimed the decision to hand Mr Entwistle a . pay-off worth a year’s salary was necessary to ensure his swift . resignation and co-operation with a series of internal inquiries. Outraged: Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman, left, and Culture Secretary Maria Miller, right, told MPs it was unacceptable for disgraced George Entwistle to keep all of his £450,000 pay-off . Mr Entwistle’s contract entitled him . to only six months’ severance pay if he resigned. But Lord Patten . suggested that Mr Entwistle would have been sacked if he had refused to . quit – in which case he would have been entitled to a 12-month pay-off. Lord . Patten’s explanation irritated Downing Street and led to fresh calls in . Parliament for his resignation. In other developments: . ■ . An official report by Ken MacQuarrie into the disastrous Newsnight . investigation said the programme failed to complete ‘basic journalistic . checks’, . ■ The BBC’s director of news, Helen Boaden, and her deputy, Stephen Mitchell, ‘stepped aside’, . ■ . Boris Johnson called on Lord Patten to apologise ‘on his knees’ to Lord . McAlpine, the former Tory Treasurer smeared by Newsnight, . ■ . The Corporation’s new acting director-general Tim Davie, a former Pepsi . marketing man turned up tieless on the second day of the job –but . pledged to ‘get a grip’ of the crisis. He refused to be drawn on Mr . Entwistle’s pay-off, . ■ Iain . Overton, head of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which helped . Newsnight produce the child abuse report, resigned from his post, . ■ . Labour’s deputy chairman Tom Watson was urged to apologise for using . Parliamentary privilege to make separate claims that a senior Tory was . involved in child abuse. Humiliation: George Entwistle, flanked by BBC chairman Chris Patten, announces his resignation to the media over the 'unacceptable' Newsnight broadcast which wrongly implicated a senior former Conservative in a child abuse scandal . During an emergency debate in the Commons four MPs called for Lord Patten to go. Philip Davies, a Tory member of the Commons culture, media and sport committee said the former Conservative Party chairman had been ‘asleep at the wheel’. Labour MP John Mann said Lord Patten should be sacked to allow the BBC to ‘move on’. Tory MPs Peter Bone and Philip Hollobone also called for him to go. Mrs Miller, who is privately dismayed by Lord Patten’s slow response to the crisis, suggested his job was safe for now, saying it was ‘in the long term interests of the BBC to have a period of stability’. She said Lord Patten had ‘a key role in ensuring this crisis is handled successfully’. Tory MPs David Nuttall and Justin Tomlinson said the crisis of trust raised questions about the future of the licence fee. Mr Nuttall said: ‘This latest debacle will bring forward the day when the British people will have the freedom to decide for themselves whether to pay for the BBC.’ Other MPs insisted the crisis must not be used as an excuse to dismantle a much-loved institution. Senior Tories claimed an anti-Conservative bias within the BBC helped explain the haste with which Newsnight attempted to ‘smear’ members of the Thatcher government without proper checks. MP Conor Burns described the Newsnight investigation as a ‘vengeful and spiteful’ attack on Lady Thatcher and her legacy. Boris Johnson called for everyone involved in the broadcast to be sacked immediately. He said the false claim that a senior aide to Lady Thatcher had been involved in child abuse was ‘like a dream come true for any vaguely resentful and left-of-centre BBC producer’.","Lord Patten's deputy Diana Coyle spoke to her boss on the phone about the deal with Strictly on in the background .

Although 15 per cent of British drivers already have digital radios in their car, 41 per cent say DAB radios are the next big thing for in-car technology. And, despite the Government indicating the digital radio switch-over might take place in the next couple of years, many motorists have not yet bought a DAB radio for their car because they are wrongly concerned about price.

I want to kill myself.' following the incident involving John Rosi the school wrestling coach at Gig Harbor's Kopachuk Middle School. Caught on film by fellow students the alleged bullying by Rosi directly followed a 15-minute period where the boys fellow eighth-graders swung him from his arms and legs, wrote on his feet, stuck a traffic cone on his head, gagged him with his own sock and taunted him. Scroll Down for Video . The children held the teen down while they placed chairs over his head during John Rosi's class . The teenagers parents became aware of the incident which occurred in February after their son refused to go to school and became withdrawn. They complained and asked Kopachuk to make students hand over relevant video footage from their cell-phones when requested. 'I was shocked. My wife broke down crying. It was tough to see,' said Randall Kinney, the boy's father to KING5.com . The incident happened at around 9 a.m. in the morning during a class and Rosi is seen to join in with the swinging of the boy by poking him and pretending to sit on him, saying, 'I'm feeling kind of gassy.' The unnamed boy is seen here with a traffic cone on his head at the beginning of the 15-minute video shot by fellow students at Kopachuck Middle School . The children can be seen on the video incapacitating the teenager by placing chairs over his body as the draw on his feet . Then the children goaded on by John Rosie swing the boy by his legs and arms as he struggles and he can not get free . John Rosi is seen standing over the children as they stand on top of the unnamed teenager who claims he was bullied . The class that is supposed to be in session is a half hour reading and math preparation lesson conducted by Rosi. In one of the videos, a dozen students drag the teenager around the room, swing him like a hammock, rip off his socks, write on his feet, shove a sock down his mouth, hold a pillow over his face and then cover him with chairs. This continues for 15 minutes until Rosi joins in and smiles and at one point, he smiles for the cameras. Following viewings of the video, Rosi, a 14-year-veteran of the school was suspended for 10 days without pay, given training and then eventually moved to another school. According to the Tacoma News Tribune his base salary as of 2010 was $64,174, with approximately $10,000 more for coaching duties. 'Rosi is completely ignorant of the fact that he’s got a whole classroom hazing one kid,' said the boy’s father, interviewed Monday by The News Tribune. 'They classified it as roughhousing. But it’s not 14 kids wrestling each other. It’s a dozen kids using my son to demonstrate their dominance over him.' 'I was horrified by what I saw,' said acting Peninsula School District Superintendent Chuck Cuzzetto to KSDK.Com . Cuzetto said the teacher displayed 'inappropriate classroom management,' but the district decided against firing the teacher because of his 'body of work' over an 18-year teaching career in the district. John Rosi can be seen to put his foot onto the chairs that are on top of the teen . Once he has got free from the other children the boy points his finger at John Rosi who is supposed to be teaching class . John Rosi is seen (left and right) to grab hold of the smaller teenager by the arms . John Rosi eventually pushes the boy to the ground and his red hoodie can be seen at the bottom of the picture . 'It's an isolated situation in an 18-year career. That's horrific, and it deserves some pretty significant action fast. And that's what we did,' said Cuzzetto.

Ah, Christmas dinner, that famous feast of edible fairy lights, red Scotch egg baubles, frankincense and myrrh broth, ice cold mulled wine and nitrogen-poached meringues which look like snowballs but taste like pine trees. Er, hang on. Welcome to the topsy-turvy festive table of chef Heston Blumenthal, a new treat from the mad scientist of cooking, who may have failed his chemistry O-level at school but has more than made up for it since by introducing the world to the whizzbang world of molecular gastronomy. For the first time ever Heston Blumenthal will be hosting a special Christmas lunch in his flagship restaurant in Bray, The Fat Duck . This Christmas, Blumenthal is laying on a bonkers feast of completely doolally dimensions at his flagship Bray . restaurant, the three Michelin-starred Fat Duck. The 12-course tasting menu lunch in West Berkshire costs £300, excluding alcohol, and will be held over three Sundays in December (2, 9, 16). The Fat Duck - known for its year-round £195 tasting menu which features dishes such as snail porridge, the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, red cabbage gazpacho, salmon poached in liquorice gel and Sound Of The Sea, which involves listening to an iPod while you eat - will offer a . unique Christmas experience designed by Blumenthal and his busy . team to celebrate the festive season. A standard Christmas turkey lunch.....very unlike what you will get in Bray this December . Diners will be treated to . brand new dishes including a Christmas tree decorated with edible pork Scotch egg baubles; savoury lollies (Waldorf rocket, salmon twister and mulled wine feast); and something called the Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh which involves dropping a gold bar into broth. There's also edible snow, partridge with pear, edible tinsel, nitro-scrabled egg and bacon ice cream, and plates named Advent and Like A Kid In A Sweet Shop. Speaking to MailOnline, Blumenthal said: 'The man-power involved in making the Christmas menu is phenomenal. It's a lot of work. If you started from . scratch, the time it would take one person to make one menu would be about 10 days. It's crazy. Luckily we have a whole team doing it!'

Describing the impetus behind his festive feast, Blumenthal said: 'I'm basically a big kid. I'm not a scientist - I failed chemistry O-level - I'm just a bloke who likes to know how things work. 'And I think Christmastime brings out the kids in all of us - that excitement and the smells and the memories. We've had a lot of fun making edible Christmas decorations like gold and silver and red baubles that hang on a tree, edible . tinsel, edible snow...we're still working on the edible fairy lights. 'The idea is that each table gets a little tree at the beginning of the meal to pick at. Like a selection of canapes. And it looks great. So realistic. 'The baubles are coated in coloured jelly, so there is a Scotch egg one coated in red pepper and cardamom jelly, and one covered in edible glitter. Another one is blown sugar. Another is prawn cocktail.' Bray Village, home to Heston Blumenthal's three dining rooms, covered in snow . The Fat Duck's chicken - not your average Sunday lunch .

'Then there are the liquid nitrogen-poached meringues that look like snowballs but actually taste like Christmas trees, and a glass of mulled wine that is hot when you drink from one side, and ice cold when you drink from the other. It looks like one liquid but it's actually two. It's quite fun. 'My favourite thing on the menu is the Botrytis Cinerea, a bunch of balls that look like grapes, developed using the flavour molecules in Sauterne wine, but each one tastes completely different.'

Children can have a present from Santa for £10. The chef adds the final touches to a dish in his three Michelin starred restaurant . Blumenthal - who is entirely self-taught and whose first paid job as a chef was when he opened The Fat Duck - does occasionally step back and see the 'ridiculousness' of the situations he finds himself in. 'I'm a big picker, as is the nature of my job, so have to be careful not to eat too many carbohydrates. I love chicken. Last night I had some roast chicken with lentils, but I do have a weakness for pork pies. What can I say? I'm a kid of the Seventies so I do love a bit of food kitsch.' He said: 'It's quite funny when I talk really seriously about the hurdles we come up against in certain situations, and then I step back and take a look. 'I remember once having such a conversation about the logistics of a certain dish while I was literally stuffing live blackbirds into a massive pie. It was quite surreal. And there are a lot of moments like that in my life. 'It's funny because I always wanted to be a chef, but I never for a second imagined it would be anything like this. And it was never the case that I was really ambitious and desperate to succeed - it was always more that I just had an enormous fear of failing.'

But what will the man himself be making for Christmas lunch? 'I certainly don't go as overboard as I do in the restaurant! I tend to make chicken or goose - I like goose with black pudding, confit legs, roast potatoes and red cabbage, and if I'm doing chicken I'll make green cabbage.

With no showers on the ward, they had to clean themselves in disposable cardboard wash bowls filled with water. And because there were no proper catering facilities, they were given sandwiches and frozen ready meals heated in a microwave instead of freshly prepared food. Pindersfields General Hospital: Legal restriction to stop it from keeping patients in the surgical day unit for more than 23 hours . Patients on the ward also had to leave their belongings on the floor because there were no bedside cupboards. The failings were discovered at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, by Care Quality Commission inspectors. To ensure the ‘safety and wellbeing’ of patients, the watchdog body has now banned the hospital from keeping . them on the day-surgery ward for more than 24 hours. Patients on the day unit did not receive freshly cooked meals for days and washed in disposable bowls . The disposable cardboard wash bowls . they were required to use are favoured  by NHS staff over plastic ones . as there is  a lower risk of infections being spread between patients. Due to a clause in the hospital’s . catering contract, it cannot provide patients with hot food from the . kitchen on the day- surgery ward. Stephen Eames, interim chief executive of the trust, said: 'We do accept that the facilities and environment on this unit were not entirely suitable for inpatients' Patients were only meant to stay in . the unit for up to 24 hours before being discharged or transferred to . another ward, but some had to remain there for four days.

Syrian rebels fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad clashed with armed Kurds near the Turkish border today in the latest sign of a new power struggle in Syria's ethnically diverse north-east. Exploiting the unravelling of Assad's grip in wide swathes of Syria, Kurds have been asserting control in parts of the northeast, bidding for the self-rule and rights denied to their community for decades under Assad and his father before him. Some fear the increasingly sectarian tinge of the anti-Assad uprising will splinter Syria. But whoever takes charge in the Kurdish plains nudging against Turkey will control a chunk of Syria's estimated 2.5 billion barrels of crude oil reserves. A father comforts his son who has just undergone surgery for a bullet wound in his left shoulder outside a field hospital in the northwestern city of Maraat al-Numan, Syria . On Monday, gunfire clattered in the mixed Arab and Kurdish frontier town of Ras al-Ain, which was overrun by the mainly Sunni Muslim Arab rebels on November 8 and bombed by Assad's forces in the days that followed. Fleeing residents said the fighting was between insurgents of the Free Syrian Army and Kurds affiliated with the Democratic Union Party, a Syrian Kurdish party with links to Kurdish separatist militants in Turkey. Opposition activists at the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported clashes, with a rebel advance into Syria's Kurdish heartland meeting resistance. Kurds in the region are suspicious of the Free Syrian Army and whether any post-Assad, Islamist-dominated government would be more accommodating of Syria's largest ethnic minority. The Observatory said at least four Kurdish militiamen had been wounded in the fighting and that a rebel sniper had shot dead the leader of Ras al-Ain's local Kurdish Council, Abed Khalil. 'The injuries were the result of clashes between the two sides when rebels launched an assault on a checkpoint belonging to the Units for the Protection of the Kurdish People,' it said, referring to a PYD-affiliated militia.

Future: Lord Patten leaves his home today and admits that the future of Newsnight is in doubt . The future of Newsnight is hanging in the balance after Lord Patten admitted its botched report that falsely accused Tory peer Lord McAlpine of being a paedophile could see it scrapped after 32 years. The BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten and acting director general Tim Davie will meet today to discuss if the programme can survive the corporation's crisis. Newsnight was first broadcast in January 1980 but in the past year it has been badly damaged by its decision not to run an investigation into Jimmy Savile's abuse of children and now the smearing of Lord McAlpine. When Lord Patten was asked if the show will survive he said: 'That's one of the things we will be discussing with the acting director-general today. 'I think one of the things that should survive is the investigative journalism which it has represented along with Panorama. 'At the heart of our news offering has to be uncompromising investigative journalism but you have to get it right.' John Whittingdale, chairman of the culture and media select committee, said: 'Newsnight has been very badly damaged by this, and maybe it will need to . re-branded. But the BBC will need to continue to have a flagship news and . current-affairs programme' Newsnight has already been wounded by . its decision not to air an investigation it commissioned last year into . the criminal activities of the late Jimmy Savile. Last . month, following a decision by ITV to screen the allegations, Newsnight . editor Peter Rippon 'stepped aside' pending the outcome of a review by . Nick Pollard. Two more senior BBC staff today 'stepped aside' at the crisis-hit Corporation as the fallout continues after a botched Newsnight investigation. Then and now: Newsnight started in January 1980 with Peter Snow (left during first show) and is now presented by stars including Jeremy Paxman .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 03:47 EST, 12 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:51 EST, 12 November 2012 . Failed BBC director general George Entwistle may have been sacked had he not done the 'honourable' thing and quit after just 54 days in the job, Lord Patten has admitted. The BBC Trust's chairman said he and other board members were poised to consider the 'option of termination' but instead agreed to pay him his £450,000 salary for the next year if he left. Lord Patten has been engulfed in a political row after signing off Entwistle's £1.32million severance package, which includes a £877,000 pension pot, as MPs have called it 'unjustifiable and unacceptable' and a 'reward for failure'. Entwistle quit on Saturday when Newsnight apologised for smearing Lord McAlpine after they accused a senior political figure of being a paedophile, which led to the Tory peer being wrongly named online as the man who abused children at a care home near Wrexham, north Wales. Hours before his resignation he had a series of disastrous interviews where he maintained he . would not leave the BBC as he had 'a job to do', but then quit with a bumper pay deal. Package: George Entwistle quit the BBC on Saturday and will get his annual salary of £450,000 plus a £877,000 pension pot . Under the terms of his contract, Entwistle was entitled to only six months' pay, but the trust said that the additional payment had been agreed as a reflection of his continuing involvement with the various BBC inquiries now under way. Justifying the deal in a letter the John Whittingdale, chair of the Commons' media select committee, Lord Patten claims it was for the good of the BBC. Pressure: Lord Patten signed off Entwistle's generous deal that has put his job under threat and caused fury from MPs . 'The alternative was long drawn-out discussions and continuing . uncertainty at a time when the BBC needs all of its focus to be on . resolving fundamental issues of trust in BBC journalism,' he added. 'In the absence of George's honourable offer to resign, I would have had to speak to the trustees about the option of termination by us (which, fortunately, was not necessary). 'In . these circumstances, George would have been entitled to 12 months' notice. In circumstances where we needed to conclude matters quickly and . required George's ongoing co-operation in a number of very difficult . and sensitive matters, including the inquiries into issues associated . with (Jimmy) Savile, I concluded that a consensual resignation on these . terms was clearly the better route.' In an urgent session in the Commons on . the issues, asked for by Labour, Media Minister Maria Miller said his . payoff was 'hard to justify' and suggested the public spending watchdog could probe the package. 'The National Audit Office is empowered to conduct a value for money review of any issue. If they decide to review this decision, I expect that the BBC would co-operate fully,' she told the Commons,' she said. 'The circumstances of his departure make it hard to justify the level of severance money that has been agreed. Debate: Media Minister Maria Miller said in the Commons that Entwistle's payoff could be probed by the National Audit Office who would consider if it represented value for money . 'Contractual arrangements are a matter for the BBC Trust, but the Trust also has clear responsibilities to ensure value for money for the licence fee payer.' The National Audit Office confirmed this . afternoon it will talk to BBC Trust over possible value for money review . over George's Entwistle payoff. Tory MP Richard Bacon, a member of . the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said the BBC should be open to . the same scrutiny as any other public institution. Angry: Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said Entwistle should hand half his package back . In a question to the Culture Secretary, he said the National Audit Office's boss, comptroller and auditor-general Amyas Morse, should have 'unfettered' access to the Corporation's accounts so he could investigate whether there were any irregularities in Mr Entwistle's payout. Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said the chairman of the BBC Trust had been ‘asleep at the wheel’ during the crisis at the BBC. In a question to Ms Miller, he said: ‘Lord Patten has wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds on the appointment process for George Entwistle. ‘He's now wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds paying him off and saying that he wasn't up to the job, he was overwhelmed by the job, and he was right to resign. ‘Lord Patten has been asleep at the wheel. He has been off the pace right from the word go. He is part of the problem rather than the solution.’ Senior Tory John Redwood branded the pay-off ‘outrageous’, while Labour's Paul Farrelly of Newcastle-under-Lyme said it was ‘misjudged’. Conservative Rob Wilson of Reading East said he was concerned such large golden goodbyes could be used by the BBC to ensure the silence of former employees who might otherwise cause embarrassment. Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman called on Mr Entwistle to return half the money, adding: 'The BBC Trust cannot justify a payoff of double the amount laid down in his contract. 'George Entwistle should reflect on this and only take that to which he is entitled.' She . said it was 'disgraceful' that Newsnight's report led to Lord McAlpine . being branded a child sex offender, 'a damning accusation which could . only have caused him and his family untold distress'. Mayor of London Boris Johnson has hit out at the 'shoddy' and 'cretinous' BBC journalists who smeared Lord McAlpine. In his Daily Telegraph column he said that the corporation was in 'grief' at its own failures but should be doing more to apologise to the Tory peer. 'It’s tragic for us! say Beeb journalists, who are all interviewing each other in a ludicrous orgy of self-pity. In all this nauseating navel-gazing and narcissism, there seems to be no one – from Lord Patten downwards – who appears to be remotely interested in the person the BBC has injured. Has anyone even begun to apologise, in a fitting manner, to Alistair McAlpine?' he wrote. Boris also added that Lord Patten should say sorry to Lord McAlpine personally. 'The journalism was so shoddy, so cretinous, so ready to let the wish be father to the thought that the Beeb really now has to show that Newsnight was not acting with malice,' he said. 'The BBC cannot minimise what the programme has done. There will be people out there who will continue to believe that there is no smoke without fire, that Newsnight would never have broadcast such allegations unless there was something in it. 'The BBC owes it to McAlpine to grovel and keep grovelling until the public gets the message. Everyone associated with the “paedophile” segment on Newsnight should be sacked instantly. 'Then Chris Patten should make a penitential pilgrimage to McAlpine’s Italian B&B, on his knees and scourging himself with a copy of the BBC charter. This tragedy is not about the BBC; it is about the smearing of an innocent man. The BBC needs to grasp that first.' But . Ms Harman, seen as a cheerleader for reform of how the press is . regulated in the run-up to Lord Justice Leveson's report into standards . and practices of the press, attacked the corporation's media rivals for . 'pouncing' on its latest crisis. 'The BBC is a loved and trusted institution but it has enemies waiting to pounce,' said the deputy Labour leader. She . called on the Government to 'stand up against the commercial . competitors and political opponents who are lining up to attack and . wound the BBC at this moment of crisis'. She . added: 'The BBC has made grave mistakes and it must sort them out, but . everyone, including us politicians, must keep cool heads and let that . happen.' Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman also said today it was 'hard to justify' the £450,000 payoff to Mr Entwistle. Asked whether Mr Cameron backed the payout to Mr Entwistle, the spokesman said: 'That is clearly a matter for the BBC Trust and it is an issue where they will need to justify that payment to licence fee payers. 'Clearly it is hard to justify a sizeable payoff of that sort, but that is a matter for the BBC Trust and it is for them to justify.' He said it was 'a matter for George Entwistle' whether he chose to accept the money. Asked how the PM felt recent events had impacted on the reputation of the BBC, the spokesman said: 'It is important that the BBC grip this and that credibility and public trust are restored.' The move was greeted with anger and disbelief by MPs. The chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, John Whittingdale, said the trust had to explain how it could justify such a large pay-off. 'A lot of people will be very surprised that somebody who was in the job for such a short period of time and then had to leave in these circumstances should be walking away with £450,000 of licence fee payers' money,' he said. 'Certainly I would want to know from the trust why they think that's appropriate. I find it very difficult to see a justification for that amount of money to be paid to somebody who has had to resign in these circumstances. 'I wouldn't have thought that just because you have to help an inquiry into the Savile allegations you necessarily need to be paid a such a large amount of money.' Harriet Harman MP, Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, added: 'It is not justifiable for the BBC to pay double the contractually required sum to the director general on his resignation. It looks like a reward for failure. 'George Entwistle should decline to accept any more than is required under his contract. 'This is not the way to restore public confidence in the BBC.' Gerry Sutcliffe MP, another member of the culture, media and sport committee, said Entwistle's severance packagewas 'symptomatic of the problems around the BBC', adding: 'He has not had time to make an impact and to get that amount of money is ridiculous.'

He has to decide if senior staff will go in the wake of the Newsnight scandal . The former Pepsi Cola marketing man dramatically placed in temporary charge of the BBC will today have to decide on whether to authorise a new round of blood letting – with a host of senior managers facing the axe. Tim Davie, 45, has been handed a report into Newsnight’s botched investigation that wrongly linked a senior politician to child abuse allegations in North Wales. Up to six senior staff members could be jettisoned in the wake of director general George Entwistle’s sudden departure over the November 2 programme. Mr Davie, who has no journalistic experience, now finds himself running the world’s best-known broadcaster even though he did not make the final round of interviews when he applied to be director general this year. His first task will be to assess the report by BBC Scotland’s Ken MacQuarrie into how the Newsnight investigation went so terribly wrong. Last night BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten warned that the two current internal inquiries – one on the dropped Jimmy Savile report and the other on North Wales – ‘may involve people’s jobs as well’. But there are growing fears among senior staff that the corporation is ‘rudderless’ and there is a power vacuum at the top of the organisation. Newsnight editor Peter Rippon last month ‘stepped aside’ as the corporation probed the bloody aftermath of the decision to drop an investigation last year into the Savile claims. Acting editor Liz Gibbons faced tough questioning by the MacQuarrie inquiry which is looking into how the discredited film led to Tory peer Lord McAlpine being wrongly labelled a paedophile on the internet. Adrian Van Klaveren, Miss Gibbons’s boss, who was drafted in to keep an eye on ‘Savile-related’ material after Mr Rippon’s departure, is also facing a nervous morning today. The controller of Radio 5 Live referred the story up to an executive on the management board, BBC Northern Ireland’s Peter Johnston, who is a former management consultant. There is also continued speculation about the future of the corporation’s director of news Helen Boaden, her deputy Stephen Mitchell and director of editorial policy David Jordan. Downcast: Lord Patten on The Andrew Marr Show at BBC studios in London yesterday . Candidates: Lord Patten has called for the new appointment to be made in the next few weeks . Last night, as recriminations continued to rage, it emerged that a host of the BBC’s most famous presenters are on the ‘warpath’ telling the corporation’s top bosses they must ‘get a grip’. They pointed out that the decision, post Savile, to effectively sideline executives such as Miss Boaden, who spent last weekend on a walking holiday, has left the corporation bereft of high-level journalist experience. Mr Davie is described by BBC Chairman Lord Patten as ‘a very good man’ and is no stranger to media scandals. He was in charge of BBC radio when the . Andrew Sachs scandal erupted in 2008 with Jonathan Ross and Russell . Brand leaving lewd messages on the actor’s answerphone. Although he initially described Ross and . Brand as ‘brilliant entertainers’ the former Ross did not have his . lucrative contract renewed and the latter quit. Condemnation: Tory MP Philip Davies described the BBC as in a ¿terrible state¿ . Lord Patten, clearly aware of the criticism about Mr Davie’s lack of editorial experience, has spoken of the need to surround a director general with people that can make the job ‘doable’. Ben Bradshaw, a Labour MP who sits on the Culture select committee in the Commons, speculated on further sackings, saying: ‘I think it cannot end here.’ Tory MP John Whittingdale told BBC Radio 4 yesterday: ‘If George Entwistle was unaware of the programme, which he says he was, then clearly somebody below him took the decision that it was right to broadcast it. ‘That was a terrible decision and people need to take responsibility for that. So potentially it may require other people to resign.’ Conservative MP Philip Davies claimed last night claimed that in recent weeks it had looked like ‘there was no one running the BBC’ saying the corporation was in a ‘terrible state’. Last night a BBC Trust spokesman said: ‘The BBC Trust has this evening had a discussion with the acting director general, Tim Davie, and we are looking forward to him setting out tomorrow his plans for dealing with some of the issues arising from the November 2 Newsnight broadcast as a first step in restoring public confidence.’","Six more BBC chiefs in the crosshairs over Newsnight scandal .

Dozens of BBC stars face an ‘employment test’ as the corporation tries to shake off suspicions it is complicit in tax avoidance. The BBC wants to analyse how much of its employees’ work is based at the corporation, before deciding whether to force them to be members of staff. If nearly all of a person’s income comes from the licence fee-funded broadcaster, they face a ban from being paid via a private company and will be required to pay income tax in the normal way. The BBC will today publish a review into how it pays its top stars, following a political row about its tax arrangements. MPs have criticised the way the corporation pays some of its performers and presenters through so-called personal service companies, sparking fears it was enabling tax avoidance. Last month BBC chairman Lord Patten conceded that it was ‘undoubtedly the case’ that some freelance staff would be put on the payroll. But it is understood that a formula looking at ‘a variety of criteria’ will be used to decide whether to make them members of staff. The full nature of the ‘employment test’ has yet to be defined but insiders say they expect it to be based on how much work the individual does for the corporation. A senior source said it was likely to stop short of demanding specific details of all of an employee’s outside work, but would probably ask what percentage of income came from companies other than the BBC. The source said: ‘It will change the way the BBC engages some people and the logical thing will be that some people will be forced back [on to staff books]. That will be the policy.’ Stars such as Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman, who both said they had been forced to be paid this way, could be offered the chance to become BBC staffers. But sources admitted it would be a ‘very interesting question’ if stars refused to go back on the books, adding that it had the potential to lead to many difficult individual discussions. The BBC wants to analyse how much of its employees' work is based at the corporation, before deciding whether to force them to be members of staff . Today’s review is expected to say that the BBC has not been doing anything illegal but that it should have a closer relationship with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. It will highlight the need for a clearer framework to avoid further controversy over how freelance staff are paid. Lord Patten said last month the review would come up with ‘additional steps’ to ‘clear up any suspicions’. The head of the BBC Trust added: ‘I think it is undoubtedly the case that as a result some freelancers will be put on the payroll.’ Stars at the BBC have expressed anger at bosses that they had been made to look like tax avoiders when they had been told to set up personal service companies by the corporation. Last month the influential Public Accounts Committee said the off-the-books arrangements created ‘suspicions of complicity in tax avoidance’. Treasury secretary Danny Alexander said he expected the corporation to take ‘swift and decisive action’ to address public concern. Personal service companies could save individuals thousands of pounds because they pay  corporation tax rather than income tax. It has been suggested that those facing a return to the payroll could face pay cuts of up to 40 per cent because national insurance payments will have to be paid for by the BBC, along with other costs. A BBC spokesman last night refused to discuss the report.","MPs have criticised the way the BBC pays some of its performers through personal service companies .

BBC Director-General George Entwistle sealed his own fate as he was humiliated by his staff in two disastrous interviews yesterday. The BBC chief received a grilling by respected reporters on BBC Breakfast and Radio 4's Today programme. During the two interviews Mr Entwistle, forced to resign for 'shoddy journalism' yesterday, revealed his lack of awareness of the Newsnight programme in which Lord McAlpine was wrongly accused of being . involved in a child abuse scandal. Scroll down for video . Stand off: John Humphrys (left) grills George Entwistle (right) on air and questions him, 'you should go, shouldn't you?' He claimed he knew nothing about the . allegations against Lord McAlpine - despite him being a former senior . Tory - and had only found out about the extent of the accusations on . Twitter the day after the show's broadcast. In a tense 15-minute interview with veteran presenter John Humphrys on BBC’s . flagship Radio 4 Today news programme, Mr Entwistle was told by Humphrys: 'You should go, shouldn't you?' He also admitted he only saw the Newsnight programme the day after it was aired, saying: 'I was out'. In a second nine-minute interview with Louise Minchin and Charlie Stayt on BBC Breakfast, he stumbled his way through a series of damning questions. When asked: 'When did you know as Director-General of the BBC that Lord McAlpine was the figure they were investigating?' Mr Entwistle is grilled by Louise Minchin and Charlie Stayt on BBC Breakfast yesterday . At one point during the humiliating interview, pictured, Stayt said: 'Many people will find it extraordinary that in your position and given what has already happened that you weren't alerted? He replied, whilst stumbling and repeating his words: 'I . didn't find that out, to be frankly I didn't find that out until it . became clear from twitter comments and from newspaper coverage during . this last week. I did not know in . advance that he was in any sense involved in that Newsnight . investigation but I had not had that news investigation brought to my . attention prior to transmission.' At one point during the humiliating interview Stayt said: 'Many people will find it extraordinary that in your position and given . what has already happened that you weren't alerted? 'Now that seems like . the most extraordinary thing that you, if you like members of the public are finding things out for yourself sat at home while you are looking at the internet, that is an extraordinary situation?' He admitted the Newsnight report which . led to the Tory peer being implicated in . child sexual abuse should not have been broadcast, saying: 'It was our . responsibility and Newsnight’s responsibility to make sure . that and misidentification did not end up on Television. 'We did not . manage to do that and therefore we have to take the blame for that, no . question'. I quit: George Entwistle, left, makes his resignation statement last night with BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten . And in one key exchange on the Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Humphrys asked: 'When did you know . that this film was being broadcast and when was it drawn to your . attention that it was going to make extraordinarily serious allegations . about a man whose identity would inevitably be uncovered - wrongly, as . we now know?' George Entwistle replied: 'The film was not drawn to my attention before transmission.' It was all too much for him and Mr Entwistle’s stint as Director-General was over, having lasted less than two months. Mr Entwistle, 50, took over as director general from Mark Thompson on September 17 on a much-reduced salary of £450,000. Meanwhile, the chairman of the BBC Trust Lord Patten today vowed to fight on to restore confidence in the corporation in the wake of the crisis. Lord Patten said Mr Entwistle - who dramatically resigned last night - had been 'destroyed' by the botched Newsnight investigation which wrongly implicated a senior former Tory in a child abuse scandal. BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten, right, told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that Mr Entwistle had been 'destroyed' by the botched Newsnight investigation . However he made clear that he would resist calls to follow suit, insisting his job was to ensure the BBC learned the lessons from what happened and from the inquiries under way into the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal. He told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show: 'I think that I now have to make sure that, in the interests of the licence fee payer and the audience, that the BBC has a grip, that we get ourselves back onto the road. 'I think that my job is to make sure that we learn the lessons of those inquiries and that we restore confidence and trust in the BBC. If I don’t do that then I am sure that people will let me know.'

THE BBC faces a bitter battle with high-profile stars over plans to add more than 100 broadcasters to the staff books to end suspicions of tax avoidance. They are currently paid via controversial ‘personal service companies’ which the corporation yesterday admitted give individuals a ‘greater opportunity’ to reduce their tax liability. Figures released yesterday in a review of how the BBC pays its stars show that at least 124 top names earn £150,000 or more via the companies. Another 54 freelance stars receive a similar amount. Some of the BBC's highest earners, reportedly including Fiona Bruce, left, and Jeremy Paxman, right, have been employed by the corporation on a freelance basis as PSCs . The BBC has now identified 131 employees – either currently paid via the service companies or on freelance contracts – who will be asked to go on the payroll and taxed at source. This could mean stars such as Fiona Bruce, Jeremy Paxman and Sophie Raworth are told to become employees. Both Miss Bruce and Paxman have said they were told by bosses to set up the companies in order to receive their salaries. Last night a leading agent for BBC talent said performers, with backing from their accountants, would fight being put on staff. The agent said many would be able to prove they earn a large proportion of their money through after-dinner speaking, corporate work, writing and appearances outside the BBC. In addition, it emerged the BBC could end up having to increase some stars’ pay to make up for the change in circumstances. Currently, people paid through service companies are allowed to deduct up to five per cent in management expenses in calculating their tax liabilities. The shake-up comes after months of the BBC defending its tax arrangements, in the face of increasing anger from MPs who said using  the companies generated a suspicion of ‘complicity’ in tax avoidance. The review – ordered by the BBC Trust and carried out by accountancy firm Deloitte – was critical of ‘weaknesses’ and ‘inconsistency’ in the BBC’s approach. Other staff working for the BBC in a PSC arrangement are reported to include Sophie Raworth, right and Emily Maitlis, pictured left. It pointed out that staff with similar jobs were being paid in three different ways: some as staff, some as freelancers and others via the controversial companies. Yesterday the corporation said if someone ‘displays the characteristics’ of being a staff member, he or she would have to go on the payroll. This means presenters and actors will be subjected to an employment test, which will look at the proportion of income earned at the BBC, their ‘length of engagement’, certainty of work provided by the BBC and the extent to which the corporation ‘exercises control’ over them. The BBC’s chief finance officer Zarin Patel indicated that if about 70 to 80 per cent of someone’s income was at the corporation it would be likely they would be regarded as staff. After the employment test is applied to the highest earners it will then be broadened to include all workers. The working arrangements of more than 800 'on air' stars at the BBC will be urgently reviewed . The review found ‘no evidence of a BBC policy to engage with tax/national insurance avoidance’. But it said about one in six of the 804 people paid more than £50,000 a year via ‘personal service companies’ or who were self-employed, should be given traditional employment contracts. The review also predicted use of these service companies would become ‘considerably fewer than at present’. When asked if the corporation would force reluctant stars on to staff contracts, BBC Trust member Anthony Fry said there would be ‘no exceptions’. He said: ‘If someone clearly has the characteristics of being an employee... there will not be exceptions because someone is a big talent.’ Yesterday the BBC’s talent managers contacted around 45 of its stars to take them through the details of the new arrangements. Senior BBC insiders have predicted difficult conversations with stars who are reluctant to be put back on staff.","The move follows criticism last month of the corporation's use of payments to personal service companies .

I'm fine: Dame Maggie Smith looking well while out and about in London on Monday, despite rumours she had been admitted to hospital with a heart scare . Downton Abbey star Dame Maggie Smith was pictured out and . about on Monday and confirmed she is ‘fine and well at home’, despite . rumours she was rushed to hospital with a heart scare. The reports had raised fears the actress would not be fit to film a new series of the hit drama. Dame Maggie, 77, who plays Violet Crawley . in the drama, was reportedly admitted to a specialist cardiac unit last . Friday, after complaining of severe pains. As the curtain came down on the third run of the popular ITV period drama on Sunday night, fears that the public's affection for show was on the wane couldn't have been further from the truth. Figures released on Monday revealed that Downton’s latest outing was the most successful yet. It appears packing the latest series with a number of cliffhangers snared back the viewers who looked to have deserted the show at the beginning and ensured it regained its title as the programme to watch for easy Sunday night viewing. The death of Lady Sybil, one of the three Downton daughters, within hours of giving birth saw that episode beat the X Factor. Other ratings winners included spinster daughter Edith being jilted at the altar and the last episode saw the introduction of a new character, Lady Rose, the great-niece of the Dowager Countess, played by Dame Maggie Smith. She provokes scandal in the final episode by spending the evening with a married man in a dancing club. She is then shown being banished by her family to Scotland when the fling is exposed. Overall the third series had averaged almost 9.5million viewers. The last episode got an average of about 10 million viewers and a peak audience of 10.7million. This compares with the second series which had averaged 9.2million and the first which averaged 8.8million and finished on just over 10million. The first series of Downton was set between 1912 and 1914 and then moved on to the period between 1916 and 1918 for the second series and the latest run was centred in the 1920s. The show’s creator Julian Fellowes recently said in an interview that he plans to introduce Indian or black characters into the show. He said it would be ‘rather nice to open the show up ethnically’ but added it would have to be historically believable. Fourth series: Dame Maggie, 77, plays Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, in Downton Abbey, which managed 9.5m viewers for the third series . No official announcement has been made about a fourth series of Downton Abbey. But at a recent talk about the drama, Hugh Bonneville said filming for the fourth series begins in February. He also revealed that there will be a Christmas episode again this year but that unlike last year it will not actually be set during the festive period. Mr Bonnevile added: ‘It’s got a very different tone, time has moved on a bit by eight or nine months.’ Success: Despite fears that ratings would tail off, the cliffhanger endings to many episodes in the third series of Downton have kept fan viewers flocking back . Sir Peter Hall, who founded the Royal Shakespeare Company, has apologised to Downton Abbey star Laura Carmichael after apparently heckling her during a West End performance.Sir Peter allegedly shouted ‘Stop, stop stop’ and ‘It doesn’t work and you don’t work. It is not good enough. I could be at home watching television’ as Miss Carmichael delivered the final lines of Anton Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya.Sir Peter, 81, told Miss Carmichael, 26, who plays Lady Edith in Downton, that he had briefly fallen asleep and became confused when his wife woke him.‘I am mortified that I unintentionally disrupted the final scene,’ he added. He said: ‘I genuinely don’t know what’s . happening with any of our futures.  Dan (Stevens) is on Broadway at the . moment and he finishes in February which is when we start filming series . 4 so I am sure he’ll be back. But it does leave a big hole when a major . character leaves.’ At the weekend Downton creator Mr Fellowes admitted a fourth series of the period drama is likely. He said he would be ‘surprised’ if a full fourth run did not happen adding he thought the third series had ‘worked well’. Actor Brendan Coyle, who plays valet John Bates, has previously claimed the creators have decided when to end the drama. ‘I can pretty much say all of us know when Downton is going to end,’ he said. He added: ‘This is a show with a finite life.’ The opening episode of the latest series had attracted an average audience of 8.6million – which had been down 300,000 from the previous year’s series opener.","Dame Maggie Smith, 77, who plays Violet Crawley in the ITV drama is 'fine and well at home' after reportedly being in a specialist cardiac unit until Friday .

Culture Secretary Maria Miller has been left dismayed by the slow response of both Lord Patten and Mr Entwistle to the latest crisis. Ministers are reluctant to intervene directly and will give Lord Patten a chance to show he can steady the ship – provided he acts quickly.

Yesterday Lord Patten insisted that he would not bow to pressure to quit – but admitted his job was on the line unless he could turn the situation around quickly. ‘If I don’t do that and if we don’t restore the huge confidence and trust that people have in the BBC then I’m sure people will tell me to take my cards and clear off,’ he said. A senior Government source was scathing about the chairman’s performance. ‘Lord Patten has got to demonstrate he can get a grip,’ the source said. ‘Can he show he is taking control of the situation?’ Another source said: ‘For weeks we’ve had Patten in, saying you have got to make sure you have got a grip – and now we get this.’ Crisis: The BBC needs a radical overhaul following the resignation of its chief executive in wake of a scandal over a botched report on child sex-abuse allegations, Mr Patten said . In a round of media interviews . yesterday Lord Patten pledged a ‘thorough, radical, structural overhaul’ of the Corporation’s management and said a new director general would . be appointed ‘within weeks’. Underlining the seriousness of the crisis he said the BBC was ‘over’ unless it failed to restore trust in its journalism. ‘The basis for the licence fee, the basis for the BBC’s position in this country is the trust that people have in it. If the BBC loses that, it is over.’ But Lord Patten faced demands for his own resignation after admitting that he knew in advance about the sensational claims being made by Newsnight but failed to check they had been properly investigated. He said he had seen the Twitter message from Iain Overton, head of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, hours before Newsnight was screened on November 2. Former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine will sue the BBC over the Newsnight broadcast, as reported in Saturday's Mail . The message, on the social networking site Twitter, said: ‘We’ve got a Newsnight out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile.’ It sparked a storm of media interest in the programme and led to the wrongful identification on the Internet of former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine. Lord Patten said he had not done anything about it until the following day, Saturday November 3, when he ‘tried to establish whether or not there was adequate managerial control over Newsnight’. Mr Overton’s message did not identify the politician as a Conservative, but Lord Patten suggested that as a former Tory chairman it would have been ‘entirely improper’ for him to make what would have been seen as a political intervention. He said he had not told Mr Entwistle because he ‘assumed he had been told by his senior colleagues’. In an interview with the BBC’s Today programme on Saturday morning that helped seal his fate, Mr Entwistle was ridiculed for admitting he knew nothing about the Newsnight programme until the following day.","Patten's position hanging by a thread as Newsnight crisis deepens .

The number of cases of measles has almost doubled in the past year following two major outbreaks, health officials have revealed. In England and Wales there were 497 cases in the first six months of 2011. But this year that figured has soared to 964 over the equivalent period, the Health Protection Agency revealed. A spokesman said the cases have been associated with ongoing outbreaks in Merseyside and Sussex, and a small number of cases have occurred in England's travelling communities. Hives: The skin of a person suffering from measles . It is thought the rise is due to continued low vaccine uptake in some parts of the country. In 1998 Dr Andrew Wakefield linked the jab to cases of autism and bowel disorders but the research was later discredited and he was struck off the medical register - but fearsstill linger. The number of cases of rubella - also known as German measles - have also increased. The HPA said 57 cases of the viral infection were reported between January and June - exceeding the annual totals for the previous nine years. Most cases are linked to travel to other European countries.It is usually a mild infection. But if a woman becomes infected in early pregnancy, it can cause birth defects. Officials said parents should ensure that their children have received the MMR jab - the combined vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella - before going back to school. Disappearing disease: Cases had dramatically fallen in the past half century . In 1998 a paper in the medical journal The Lancet by Andrew Wakefield presented apparent evidence that autism spectrum disorders could be caused by the MMR vaccine - an immunisation against measles, mumps and rubella. But an investigation by Sunday Times journalist Brian Deer revealed that Mr Wakefield had multiple undeclared conflicts of interest, had manipulated evidence, and had broken other ethical codes. The published paper was partially retracted in 2004 and fully retracted in 2010, and Wakefield was found guilty by the General Medical Council of serious professional misconduct in May 2010 and was struck off. The following year the research was declared fraudulent by the BMJ. The scientific consensus is that no evidence links the vaccine to the development of autism and that the vaccine's benefits greatly outweigh its risks. Latest data on immunisations across England shows uptake rates of 93 per . cent for the first MMR jab and 87 per cent for the second. In Wales, the figures are 92 per cent and 87 per cent. The first dose of the MMR vaccine should ideally be given to children between 12 to 13 months of age. They are given the second dose before they start school, usually between . three and five years of age, although it can be given three months . after the first. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the HPA, said: 'It's extremely concerning that measles cases are continuing to rise. 'Measles can be very serious and parents should understand the risks associated with the infection, which in severe cases can result in death. 'It's vital that children receive both doses of the MMR vaccination and ahead of returning to school after the holidays, we are urging parents to ensure their children have received the two doses, which will provide the best protection against the risks associated with measles, mumps and rubella. 'If you are unsure if your child has had two doses of the vaccination, speak to your GP who will have a record of which vaccinations your child has received.' Adam Finn, Professor of Paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: 'Measles is an entirely preventable disease so it is very sad to see that the numbers of cases are going up. 'It's a thoroughly unpleasant illness and, from time to time, unpredictably, can turn very serious or even fatal. 'You can't get too many doses of vaccine, only too few - anything less than two - so if you are in doubt about yourself or your child, find out and, if necessary, get the MMR vaccine which will protect you against mumps and rubella as well. You can be immunised safely and effectively at any age.'","There are ongoing serious outbreaks in Merseyside and Sussex .

A healthy schoolboy who had ‘never been ill in his life’ died just weeks after a family camping holiday - during which he developed a rash on his leg. Nine-year-old Sam Leask was rushed to hospital with swollen joints and red marks on his legs and was diagnosed with the auto-immune disease Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). Soon after his kidneys failed and surgeons battled to save him. Despite undergoing a five-hour operation to remove his badly damaged colon, he died just weeks later. Nine-year-old Sam Leask (pictured with sister Izzy) was perfectly healthy until he suffered a fatal reaction to a rash on his leg . His mother Katharine, 42, said: 'Sam had never been ill in his life. I had never heard of the disease before he was diagnosed. 'Doctors said it normally goes away in time but because Sam has a certain genetic disposition, there were complications and he died. 'It feels like there is a hole, a void, that will never be filled. He was an adventurous and lovely boy and he had so much going for him.' Sam was camping with his family north of Ullswater in the Lake District in July when he developed a rash on his legs and found it too painful to stand up. He was taken by ambulance to the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle where he was diagnosed with HSP, a condition that usually clears in time. While in Yorkhill Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Sam was visited by Olympic silver medallists David Smith (left) and Luke Patience (right) After one night in hospital Sam was . given permission to return home to the village of Kirkmahoe, Dumfries . and Galloway, with Katharine, father Julian, 43, and seven-year-old . sister Izzy. But 12 days later Sam’s condition worsened and he hospitalised, when his kidneys failed. He died on October 13. HSP is a form of blood vessel inflammation and affects small blood vessels in the skin and kidneys, commonly characterised by a purple rash, and affects one in 10,000 people, usually aged between two and 10 - in a minority of cases complications lead to organ failure. An example of HSP, which is a form of blood vessel inflammation. It affects small blood vessels in the skin and kidneys and is characterised by a purple rash .

'We will forever be indebted to the staff of initially Dumfries Royal Infirmary and subsequently Yorkhill Children’s Hospital, Glasgow, for their tireless efforts in caring for Sam. 'His dignity and peace were ensured until the end and the emotional care and support continues on for us as a family.' Sam’s father Julian added: 'Sam was an adventurous little boy and when he went on holiday, we were more worried about the fact the campsite was near a main road. He loved music and played the double bass. He loved doing impressions and playing football and rugby. He was lots of fun and very bright. We could take him anywhere and he’d get on with everyone; there was nothing he loved more than people. 'He was quite simply a lovely boy.'Sam's parents have set up the Sam Leask Memorial Playground Fund to raise money to improve a children’s area in the Scottish village of Kirkton, near where they lived.

HSP is a form of blood vessel inflammation and affects small blood vessels in the skin and kidneys, commonly characterised by a purple rash. It affects one in 10,000 people, usually aged between two and 10 - in a minority of cases complications lead to organ failure. It’s not known exactly what causes it, but it often seems to follow on from a viral infection, such as a cold or respiratory tract infection, and is more common in the winter months. HSP is not an inherited disease and is not ‘catching’ so it cannot be passed on from person to person. There are usually three key symptoms. The first is a characteristic rash of raised red/purple spots that do not disappear when you press on them. It can be very alarming as it’s similar to the type of rash you see with meningococcal septicaemia. The rash is caused by tiny blood vessels (capillaries) near the surface of the skin becoming inflamed and damaged, and leaking blood into the skin. An HSP rash is generally found in the lower part of the body – around the buttocks and lower legs. It can also appear on the body, face and hands. Once the rash has fully appeared it doesn’t come and go – it tends to stay for days or even weeks. The second symptom is often abdominal pain, often in the form of stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting. Many children also experience joint pains and blood may appear in the urine. Unfortunately only the symptoms can be treated. But the condition usually settles down within around six weeks and the vast majority of people make a full recovery with no long-term effects. The most serious possible consequence of HSP is kidney damage. For this reason, regular urine tests to monitor kidney function are important, even once someone has recovered.

A mother-of-four who killed her children and then herself early on Tuesday morning said she wanted to be cremated with them, in a harrowing text message sent to a friend hours earlier. Sheriff's deputies in Brevard County, Florida said 33-year-old Tanya Thomas shot her four children, who ranged in age from 12 to 17. They were Joel, 12, Jazlin, 13, Jaxs, 15, and Pebbles Johnson, 17, deputies said, all of whom lived at the Port St John property with their mother. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Pebbles Johnson, 17, (pictured) was found having been shot in the front yard. She was taken by police car to an ambulance but later died from her injuries . Young: Jazlin Johnson, 13, (left), and her brother Jaxs Johnson, 15, (right) were both killed in the shootings . Their father, who has been told of their deaths, lives separately, but also in Brevard County, according to the New York Post. A neighbour told deputies they were woken up by the gunshots and heard a knock at the door. Three of the victims, who appeared to have been shot, were standing there asking for help. They said Thomas came out of her house and calmly called over to the kids to return home. Suicide: Tanya Thomas, pictured in a police mug shot from a 2002 booking, killed her four children and herself on Tuesday morning . 'She was very calm,' sheriff’s spokesman Tom Goodyear said of the neighbor’s report. 'She called them back and they walked back to the house.' On arrival deputies found a Pebbles', critically injured, lying in the front yard of 7245 Bright Avenue. She was taken by police car to an ambulance as a SWAT team surrounded the home. Thomas was seen at the front door holding a gun but went back inside when she saw the officers in her front yard. A short time later more gunfire was heard, prompting the SWAT team to go in through a back entrance. Once inside they found the four other bodies. Deputies had been at the home a few weeks earlier on a domestic call after a neighbour called 911. The Orlando Sentinel reported that Jaxs was arrested on a domestic violence charge which also involved his mother. Dispatch records released on Tuesday show that authorities responded to Thomas' house on three successive days in April. In the first visit, on Easter Sunday, Thomas reported that her son had thrown a bicycle through a window at the house. The next day, Thomas called to report that her son had kicked and punched her when she tried to wake him up for school. The following day, child welfare investigators visited the house to look into allegations of inadequate supervision of the children. Records also showed that Thomas was arrested in 2002 on a misdemeanor battery charge for striking the father of her children. The charge was later dropped. Victims: The four Johnson children are seen here in school pictures, clockwise from top left: Pebbles 17, Jaxs, 15, Joel, 12 and Jazlin, 13 . Two years earlier, she filed a domestic violence complaint against Joe Johnson, but that was dismissed after a hearing. Neighbour Travis St. Peter, told Florida Today that the family was known in the area for being disruptive, with police often being called to the house. 'They were just known for being hoodlums,' he said of the children, adding that they were often seen running around late at night, 'terrorizing our dogs and setting off firecrackers'. Jamie Hudson, whose mother lives two doors down from the family, told the Miami Herald that the boys in the family were known to shoot BB guns at a home across the street and had threatened to set it on fire. A friend of Thomas told the Sentinel that he had woken to a text message sent by the woman at around 3am to say that she wished to be cremated along with her children. He did not see the message until he woke up this morning, hours after the killings. Evidence: Brevard County Crime Scene Investigators look for clues at the scene of the shooting in Port St. John . Unable to speculate: Police said they don't know what the mother's motive was for killing her four children . Thorough: The road was closed off while investigations got under way . Former Orange County Sheriff's Department officer James Copenhaver told CFNews13.com that deputies would be analysing Thomas’ phone activity in the days leading up to the shooting. ‘This may also give some insight as to why she did this,’ he said. More would be known, he said, after the 911 tapes were released, including how many emergency calls were made and potentially how many shots were fired. He said that toxicology tests would be run on her to determine whether or not she was taking drugs and added that domestic violence would likely have been involved, based on past experience of similar cases. On a live chat with the former officer someone who identified themselves only as 'G' wrote that Thomas was a 'private, independent character', adding that there were 'so many components in her life'. At least three of the children killed went to Space Coast Junior-Senior High School, according toCFNews13.com. Brevard Public Schools said grief counselors have been sent to the victims' schools. A friend of the children, named Heather, said there was a lot of crying when the news was announced on the school speakers. Armed: Officers at the scene were seen carrying guns . Standoff: Police were called to the Port St John scene at around 5am on Tuesday . Scene: Sheriff's deputies in Brevard County investigating after 33-year-old Tanya Thomas shot her four children and then herself . 'I have never seen Space Coast so quiet before,' she wrote on the forum, expressing shock when the kids' yearbook photos began to be posted online. Another wrote: 'Joel was a good kid he loved playing football and he was really funny and a lot of people from Port St John will miss him dearly.' Police would not speculate on a motive, or whether Thomas had planned the mass murder. Goodyear told KMBC that he was having a hard time trying to understand how a mother could commit such a grisly act. 'I cannot comprehend as a parent doing this to their children ... calling them back in and shooting them,' he said. He said authorities have not yet determined the owner of the gun but they have no doubt that Thomas was the killer. The First Baptist Church of Port St. John said it will host a community prayer vigil Wednesday at 7pm. Port St. John is about 15 miles west of Cape Canaveral. The area is known as the 'Space Coast' because it is the home of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, home of numerous famed shuttle launches. The shooting happened just a few blocks away from Atlantis Elementary School. Bright Avenue has been closed to traffic near Curtis Boulevard as deputies continue to investigate the scene.

It is the first urban close air support range in the U.S. military, where all types of aircraft and their crews can practice with rockets, guns, and laser guided training rounds. The complex also features vehicle targets, ranging from civilian cars to armoured tanks within its, approximately, half-a-kilometer length boundary. One Army instructor told Air & . Space Magazine in 2009 that the terrain is similar to much of the Middle-East and central Asia and so provides a realistic target environment for pilots to improve their precision close air support skills.

Families are squandering up to £86 a year on electricity bills by leaving gadgets on standby or plugged in but not in use, a study suggests. Researchers calculated that not switching off computers, televisions and other electronic devices can account for up to 16 per cent of the average electricity bill. But while we are happy to let electricity seep from our sets when not catching up with our favourite shows, it appears we also spend an average six hours a day glued to the box – an hour more than previously thought. Pricey: Research also shows we watch TV for more than six hours a day rather than the previous estimate of five . The study, by . the Energy Saving Trust and two government departments, has revealed . that Brits are wasting far more energy than previously thought, sparking . a wave of concern among environmentalists and ministers. Across the UK, households could be losing £1.3 billion by not fully switching off their various electronic devices. The study, which closely monitored the electricity use of 250 homes, found that the households were spending between £50 and £86 on gadgets in a 'non-active' or standby state, equivalent to 9 per cent to 16 per cent of the average electricity bill. The research also found that people were watching more television than previously thought, with the TV on for more than six hours a day rather than the previous estimate of five hours on average. This could mean that the UK as a whole is watching 10 billion hours more TV a year than estimated, adding £205 million to electricity bills across the country. The research, which only followed people who owned the home they lived in, also found single-person households were using as much, or sometimes more, electricity to run appliances for cooking and laundry as average families. Bigger bills: Running a washing machine and tumble dryer costs on average £80 a year . This could have 'troubling' implications for efforts to cut electricity use, if the trend towards increasing numbers of lone households continues, the report’s authors warn. Almost a third (29 per cent) of homes were one-person households in 2010. The study also revealed UK households run an average of five and a half washes a week, and homes with a tumble dryer use it for four-fifths of laundry cycles rather than using outdoor washing lines or indoor drying racks. Running a washing machine and tumble dryer costs on average £80 a year, not including the cost of detergents and fabric softeners. And even more energy is used for keeping kitchenware clean, with households that have dishwashers using on average nearly double the amount of electricity on them than on washing machines, the report revealed. Elsewhere in the home, families were spending an average of £35 on powering their computer use, with laptops much cheaper to run than desktop computers. 'Vital insight': Energy Minister Greg Barker says UK households need to be more energy efficient . And households were spending around £68 on electricity for consumer electronics such as TVs, DVD players, hi-fis and radios, but those with the latest 'home cinema' style set-ups could be paying out more than £300 a year to power them. Philip Sellwood, chief executive of the Energy Saving Trust (EST), said: 'It’s crucial that households across the nation can make informed decisions by having the right advice to help them reduce their energy usage and fuel bills. 'This research shows that there’s still more work to be done with consumer advice, product innovation and take-up of energy efficiency labelling.' He said the EST was working through its Energy Saving Trust Recommended labelling scheme to help consumers spot the most energy efficient appliances. The Government said it was working with the EU to make sure green energy labels are displayed on all new electrical appliances to provide clear and easily recognisable advice for consumers. The Powering the Nation report revealed that the households studied were using around 10 per cent more than average UK energy use, even though they were homes where residents said they were careful about their energy habits. Energy used to heat and power homes accounts for over a quarter of the UK’s carbon emissions. Environment minister Lord Taylor said: 'As this survey shows we are using a lot more energy than previously thought. 'Manufacturers need to develop more energy efficient electrical products and help consumers save money and the environment. 'We can all do simple things like switching off our televisions, computers and other home electronics and save up to £85 on electricity bills each year.' Energy and climate change minister Greg Barker said: 'Using energy more wisely in our homes will not only cut carbon but will also help save money on bills. 'But first we need to really understand how we use this energy in order to become more energy wise. 'This report provides vital insights into what is happening on the ground, highlighting the need for more energy efficient household electrical appliances and indicating which appliances contribute most to electricity demand at peak times.'","Research also shows we watch TV for more than six hours a day rather than the previous estimate of five .

Children are to be banned from a city centre under draconian plans to tackle anti-social behaviour. Critics said the decision to stop anyone under 16 walking the streets of Bangor after dark was akin to something ‘you’d expect in North Korea, not North Wales’. Police are introducing the curfew, believed to be the first time children have been banned from an entire city centre, to rid the area of yobbish behaviour. Ban: Children will be banned from Bangor town centre from Monday as police and the council in the Welsh city attempt to tackle anti-social behaviour . The strict rules, which apply between 9pm and 6am from today, mean anyone caught in the forbidden zone over the next six months could be jailed for three months or face a £2,500 fine. But parents and politicians have criticised the move, which they claim will ‘criminalise’ all young people. Membership of sports groups, youth centres and even churches could be affected, they say. Nick Pickles, director of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘The idea you could be fined or imprisoned for walking through the town centre simply because you are 15 and not accompanied by a parent is simply madness. ‘To say that anyone under 16 who is unaccompanied between 9pm and 6am is a criminal is the kind of draconian law you’d expect in North Korea, not North Wales. Criminalising every young person in Bangor – without any need for them to be engaged in any wrongdoing – is an unwarranted and disproportionate intrusion into the civil liberties of thousands of perfectly law-abiding young people.’ One mother, Jo Owen, of nearby Caernarfon, said: ‘My son is 16, our local cinema is 25 miles away. He wouldn’t be allowed to walk from the bus stop with these rules.’ Councillor Nigel Pickavance, chairman of the People of Bangor Community Group, said the curfew was a ‘total over-reaction’. ‘It is totally unjust and a massive over-reaction to do this to young people in the city,’ he said. ‘The police are making out Bangor is much worse than it is - believe it or not this is not the Bronx we are living in. Draconian: Drastic new rules mean unaccompanied under-16s will be banned from Bangor town centre . ‘There doesn’t seem to have been any consultation with the local community – everyone I’ve spoken to thinks it is a bad move.’ Banned areas include city parks, public areas and 24 individual streets. The curfew is being introduced despite claims violent crime has fallen by almost a quarter in the city after a previous measure which led to 110 individuals being banned from the area. Keith Towler, the Children’s Commissioner for Wales, said imposing a blanket ban was ‘heavy-handed’ and an ‘ineffective way of combating anti-social behaviour’. ‘It demonises under 16s, isolates them from their communities, alienates them from police and spreads the misconception all young people are troublemakers,’ he said. Speaking on behalf of North Wales Police and Gwynedd County Council, who are jointly introducing the measure, Inspector Simon Barrasford defended the move. ‘Many people are working very hard to improve and regenerate the city centre as well as just wanting to enjoy their daily lives without being intimidated or harassed and I have no doubt dispersal order areas will assist in that endeavour,’ he said. Last night a ‘Stop the Curfew’ Facebook page had almost 1,000 members. Tory MP David Jones, a minister in the Welsh Office, said he would be raising the curfew with Mark Polin, chief constable of North Wales Police, later this week. ‘I am concerned we have a measure that is indiscriminately barring a whole section of the population from the town centre,’ he added.","Unaccompanied under-16s barred from the Welsh city of Bangor .

'I often stayed there overnight with my fellow students, sleeping on cots. 'I complained to my father, and he got me into a different school, also run by Scientologists. 'There was no real curriculum; our teacher spent hours reading to us from L. Ron Hubbard's science-fiction book Battlefield Earth. The children were kept together in a dirty compound and dressed in old, torn clothes. They often went to school with head lice. 'There was always a looming threat of hard labor for those who seriously misbehaved,' said Astra. 'At night we drank a beverage we called 'CalMag,' a terrible mixture of calcium, magnesium, vinegar, and water. 'It was supposed to calm us down. I'm 33 years old now and can taste it still when I think of it.' Around the time that Astra was 12, her father Lawrence left her mother after becoming dissatisfied at the route their lives were going down. Astra rebelled. 'I'd look longingly at the public-school kids walking to class,' said Astra. 'But at the same time, I feared the outside world. 'I had been told that kids in public school are all on psychiatric drugs.' For Astra Woodcraft, bringing up her daughter Kate outside of Scientology and the Sea Org meant losing contact with her mother, her husband and her brother . Deciding to commit herself to the Sea Org after some soul searching, Astra attended a two week camp called the Estates Project Force where she signed the infamous one-billion-year contract. 'People often married young within the Sea Org, as premarital sex was forbidden,' explained Astra. 'I chose a husband at age 15, a 22-year-old named Jason Merrill. 'I was attracted to him and we had known each other for some time; we married in Las Vegas, with parental consent and a signed order from a judge, as I was underage. 'We eventually settled into a small room at a Sea Org compound, and I accepted my fate—for the most part. 'Sometimes, I would sneak away at from bed at night and visit my father, and remember that outside world. However, once an official member of the Sea Org, events started to spiral for Astra, leaving her to doubt her life in the church. 'One of my first jobs as an official member of the Sea Org was in the security department, meaning I had to make sure people obeyed church rules and ethics,' said Astra to the Daily Beast. 'It seemed that people were always in some kind of trouble—the place felt ruled by fear. 'Another thing you could get in trouble for: masturbation. 'Early on in my new job, I had to sit down with a man in his 40s who had admitted to masturbating, and tell him to cut it out. I was 15 years old.' Around this time, Astra would sleep with a rope attached to her arm so that that any fellow church members in the same room who tried to escape would be caught. Astra claims that she was prohibited from speaking to her father and that a former teacher put his hand down her blouse to feel her breast. Furthermore, Astra alleges that one security officer with the church pushed her against a wall, put his hands on her neck while he screamed and spat in her face. 'A turning point came when I was 17. For reasons I do not know—perhaps money-related—members of the Sea Org were suddenly advised not to have children,' said Astra. Astra Woodcraft and her family traveled from the United Kingdom to the United States to pursue their devotion to Scientology . 'We were told that a pregnant woman would be turned out of the organization. Resolving to become secretly pregnant, Astra eventually made to escape the Sea Org and fly to England, but not before she was tracked down to the airport before she flew by her brother and other Scientologists. 'As I got near the security line, I thought with a relief, I've made it,' said Astra. 'Then I heard a familiar voice call, 'Astra'. 'My heart stopped. It was my older brother, Matt and another man I knew. 'Like me they were both members of the Sea Org. 'I assumed they were there for only one reason: to keep me from running away.' Having ran away from her husband by pretending to do laundry, Astra was now faced with her brother determined to bring her back home. 'I felt a searing pang of fear—and guilt. I didn’t want to get Matt and my mother in trouble for my escape, but I had to go,' said Astra. 'I ran from him and made it to the plane.' 13-year-old Kate Woodcraft (left) and her mother Astra Woodcraft have lived a life outside of the Church of Scientology since Astra left in 1998 . Even when she had made it to the relative freedom of England, Astra was conflicted by her emotions, having known nothing but the Sea Org and Scientology for her entire life. 'I didn’t want to be viewed as a negative 'suppressive person' who had left the church without following procedure, abandoning my family,' said Astra. 'So, two months later, I went back to Los Angeles to go through an official 'routing out' procedure. 'Essentially, this meant confessing all my bad deeds over and over again, and eventually signing a document saying I had had a wonderful experience in the Sea Org.' Filing for divorce from her husband . whom she has not seen since she left the church, Astra gave birth to her . daughter Kate in September of 1998. 'I . remember being amazed in those early days by the most simple of . freedoms, like riding my bike around a nearby park,' said Astra. 'I felt so free. Even a trip to the grocery store made me happy—I could buy whatever food I wanted. 'I . began working with my father in his architecture firm, and he literally . saved me, offering his full support and helping me realize what an . oppressive environment I had been in.' In the 14-years since her escape, Astra has become a successful architect and her daughter has just finished middle school. In the late 1990's she received a $89,000 bill from the Sea Org for the education and lodgings she had received when a member but refused to pay. 'I saw my mother two years ago, for the first time in a decade,' said Astra. 'Her sister, my aunt, had arranged the meeting, in the hopes that we could work things out. 'I can only describe seeing my mother after all those years as a strange and sad experience. 'She said she wanted to have a relationship with me, but that I needed to respect her beliefs. 'I said I could do that. I also said I wouldn’t stop talking publicly about my experience within the church. 'I have not heard from her since.'","Astra Woodcraft was moved from the UK to Florida with her Scientologist family and enrolled in a church backed school .

A circus acrobat who starred in Britain’s Got Talent lost his 'Wheel of Death' stunt act after a disgruntled nephew stole it and sold it for scrap, a court heard today. Wayne Vanderwesthuizen, 46, was planning to use the machine after he got through to the second round of the ITV talent show. But it went missing from storage in Blackpool, Lancashire, after a row with his nephew Jeremy, 26, over £3,500 unpaid wages, it was said. The Vander Brothers performing on the Triple Wheel of Death before the act went missing . Jeremy took the 'Wheel of Death' machine to the scrap yard - selling it for just £585 then sold his uncle’s Ford van on eBay to a man in London for £2,500, the court heard. It emerged Wayne had originally paid £3,000 for the act but then added to it adapting it through the years, spending a further £3,500. The fallout occurred last November after South African-born Wayne employed Jeremy to help run his circus act in which three acrobats walk, skip and jump on a set of triple revolving wheels whilst blindfolded. Preston Crown Court heard Wayne spent his winters in South Africa and summers touring around England attending agricultural shows, outdoor shows and festivals with his death-defying act. Jeremy Vanderwesthuizen, pictured left leaving Preston Crown Court is accused of stealing The Wheel of Death, worth £29,000, from his uncle, Wayne Vanderwesthuizen, pictured right also leaving court . The Wheel of Death is a steel construction of two or three wheels connected by spokes which revolve at high speeds . He would occasionally get bookings over New Year and Christmas and Jeremy was paid per event but during 2010 business began to slump and Wayne fell behind paying wages. Wayne told the jury: 'I have been doing it since 1984. Jeremy is my sister’s son. I brought him over in 2005, I trained him up with the hope eventually, one day, he would take over from me. 'I was hoping to keep it in the family, I was hoping to pass it to the next generation. 'I paid him £250 for each performing day and he took care of his own tax situation. 'In the recession, in 2009, bookings were hard to come by and I was struggling a bit, I was in some debt in South Africa as well. The Wheel of Death went missing from its storage location in Blackpool in November last year . Wayne Vanderwesthuizen bought the Wheel of Death in 1984 and has been touring with it ever since . 'I asked if I could pay him back at a later stage. '2010 was worse: I went to work in a traveling circus in Israel because there were no bookings. In 2011 he worked with me from April 25 to July 9. I terminated it (his contract). 'A booking on a triple wheel came up, there was a guy I was using that he didn’t like - but there was a contract. I told him it doesn’t matter whether you like him or not, I need to make sure I fulfil the contract. 'He eventually did agree but (he) said only if he could work the rest of the season and I said as long as you are clean-shaven, but he refused.' Wayne returned to South Africa in the second week of September last year, putting his van and equipment into storage in Blackpool, whilst Jeremy remained in England. Jeremy Vanderwesthuizen denies two charges of theft in relation to the disappearance of the Wheel of Death . Wayne Vanderwesthuizen said that the recession led to a decline in bookings for the Wheel of Death . He said he had been in touch with the man managing the storage to say they would be back in the beginning of the New Year to practice because they had gone through to the second round of Britain’s Got Talent. Wayne said he bought the van in July 2011 for £2,750 and had bought the Wheel of Death in 1987. He said the only communication he had with Jeremy since last July was an email saying that he would clear the debts with any bookings he got, which included the Abu Dhabi Grand prix. Wayne said he had already repaid his nephew £1,100, through £100 pay outs and still owed him £1,300. He has since bought another Wheel of Death from Holland at £5,500 and was still paying it off. The truck has been returned to him after police tracked it down a short time afterwards. Jeremy denies two charges of theft. Paul Hague prosecuting said: 'He accepted that he took it but he felt like he was entitled to do so because he had no money.' 'The question is his honesty. He says he was entitled to do so, or he believed he was entitled to do so - the crown say he told lies that he must’ve known that he was not entitled to scrap this piece of equipment or sell the van to some innocent third party down in London.' The trial continues.

Tragic death: Former Stamford High School football player Marcus Dixon, pictured, accidentally shot himself on Thursday night . A former Stamford High School football player who overcame homelessness as a teenager to play for West Point has died after accidentally shooting himself in the head. Marcus Dixon, 22, was showing his .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol to friends at his Stillwater Road apartment just after 7pm on Thursday when he held the gun to his head and pulled the trigger. According to police, the footballer had taken the magazine out of the weapon and pulled the stunt thinking it was empty, but one round was still in the chamber. Dixon was pronounced dead at the scene and drugs or alcohol did not appear to be a factor in the death, Lt. Diedrich Hohn told The Stamford Advocate. 'There was nothing illegal. It was a tragic accident,' Hohn said. Dixon never knew his biological mother and told The Advocate in an interview four years ago that his father dropped him off in the town when he was in seventh grade with the parting words: 'Kid, you're on your own now.' The teenager managed to avoid foster homes, staying with various friends. When he was 17, his friend Lauren McInerney's parents, Rose and Barry, tracked his father down and legally adopted Dixon, prompting '180-degree turn' in his life. But his family and football teammates are now mourning the tragic loss of the young star. Turnaround: Dixon, pictured, who overcame homelessness as a teenager to play for West Point . Star player: Dixon, pictured, was the former captain of the Stamford High School football team . Adopted: After being abandoned by his parents, Dixon was adopted by his friend's family . Captain Richard Conklin told the . newspaper that Dixon may have been under the mistaken impression that . the weapon he was holding had a magazine disconnect safety, which makes . the gun inoperable when the magazine is removed. But Dixon's pistol did not have that safety feature. Two of Dixon's friends were performing CPR on him when police and emergency crews arrived but he could not be resuscitated. 'Marcus had a lot of rough spots in his life and did not have it easy growing up,' former Stamford High School coach Kevin Jones told the Advocate. 'When he came to us there were a lot of things that we needed to address that had nothing to do with football, but we used football as a way to deal with them. The turnaround that kid made is probably the greatest I have ever seen in my 20 years of coaching.' Apartment: Dixon shot himself with his .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol at the Stillwater Road apartment, pictured, he moved into two months ago . Jones said Dixon was blessed with a mature body when he was young and had a tremendous work ethic. The team was 5-5 in Dixon's senior year, during which he rushed for 977 yards and scored two touchdowns. He also had 35 tackles on defense. Current Stamford High School Head Coach Bryan Hocter was still struggling to come to terms with the tragedy. 'I'm in shock. I don't know what to say. It is a horrible accident for something like this to happen. It's just awful,' Hocter said.","Marcus Dixon, 22, was showing pistol to friends when he removed magazine, pointed it to his head and pulled trigger .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:03 EST, 18 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:03 EST, 18 September 2012 . A new report warning Americans of an imminent obesity epidemic  is predicting that by 2030 half the adult population will be morbidly overweight. On Tuesday, the . Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation released a study, based on statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . (CDC), that forecasts a 44 percent rate of adult obesity in every state and a staggering 60 percent in 13 states. Authors of the report, entitled 'F as in Fat', are urging the population to act now or face immeasurable economic and health-related consequences. On the rise: A new report is forecasting that half the U.S. population will be obese by 2030 if we don't do something now to change our eating habits . The 'F as in Fat' report also highlights the current glum picture of the U.S. obesity . epidemic, in which 35.7 percent of adults and 16.9 percent of children . age 2 to 19 are obese according to CDC figures. Obesity raises the . risk of numerous diseases, from type 2 diabetes to endometrial cancer, . meaning more sick people and higher medical costs in the future, the . report said. It projects as many . as 7.9million new cases of diabetes a year, compared with 1.9million . new cases in recent years. There could also be 6.8million new cases of . chronic heart disease and stroke every year, compared with 1.3million . new cases a year now. The increasing . burden of illness will go right to the bottom line, adding $66billion . in annual obesity-related medical costs over and above today's $147billion to $210billion. Total U.S. healthcare spending is estimated at . $2.7trillion. That projection . supports a study published earlier this year in the American Journal of . Preventive Medicine that found that by 2030, 42 percent of U.S. adults . could be obese, adding $550billion to healthcare costs over that . period. As with all . projections, from climate models to Charles Dickens' A Christmas . Carol, human actions can prevent the worst of the scenarios, according . to health policy experts. The stats: Trust for America teamed up with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to project obesity rates nationwide based on statistics compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 'This is a tale of . two futures,' said Jeffrey Levi of George Washington University and the . executive director of Trust for America's Health. 'We're at a turning . point where if we don't do something now to mitigate these trends, the . cost in human health and healthcare spending will be enormous.' Obesity is defined . as having a body mass index (BMI) above 30. Overweight means a BMI of 25 . to 29.9. BMI is calculated by taking weight in pounds and dividing it . by the square of height in inches, and multiplying the result by 703. For instance, someone who is 5ft 5in tall and weighs 185lbs . (84 kg) has a BMI of 30.8. Obesity rates . among U.S. adults have more than doubled from the 15 percent of 1980. In that same time, they have more than tripled among children. Since the CDC found . that the percentage of obese children and adults was essentially . unchanged between 2008 and 2010, some experts question whether the 'F as . in Fat' model overstates future obesity by assuming past trends . continue in a straight line. 'This is a strong . assumption,' said economist Justin Trogdon of RTI International in North . Carolina. 'Recent evidence from other surveys suggest obesity rates may be leveling off.' Mathematician . Martin Brown of Britain's National Heart Forum, a nonprofit group, who . led development of the model, said it takes a longer view by design. 'You have to take . trends over a number of years,' he said. 'In the age groups that matter, . there just isn't much evidence of a leveling off in obesity rates.' 'We're at a turning point where if we don't do something now to mitigate these trends, the cost in human health and healthcare spending will be enormous' Obesity has long . been associated with education and income. The report found that about . one-third of adults without a high school diploma were obese, compared . with about one-fifth of those who graduated from college or technical . college. And one-third of . adults who earn less than $15,000 per year are obese, compared to . one-quarter of those who earned $50,000 or more per year. The . obesity-poverty connection reflects such facts that calorie-dense foods . are cheap and that poor neighborhoods have fewer playgrounds, sidewalks . and other amenities that encourage exercise. As a result, many . states projected to have the most obesity in 2030 do now, too. In 2011,12 states had an adult-obesity rate above 30 percent, with Mississippi . the highest at 34.9 percent. Colorado was the lowest at 20.7 percent. The report projects . that in 2030 in Mississippi, 66.7 percent of adults will be obese, as . will 44.8 percent in Colorado, which will still be the thinnest state. More surprising are . projections for states such as Delaware, now ranked 19 for obesity with . a rate of 28.8 percent. The model uses 1999 as a baseline, explained . Brown. 'So if a state had a low rate of obesity in 1999 and is fairly . high now, that indicates a steep rate of increase, which we believe will . not go away.' Result: an obesity rate of 64.7 percent in Delaware in 2030, making it the third-most obese state. States facing the greatest percentage increase in obesity-related medical costs are now in the middle of the pack. New Jersey faces the largest increase in costs, 34.5 percent, as its obesity rate . is projected to climb from 23.7 percent today to 48.6 percent in 2030. Eight other states could see increases of 20 percent and 30 percent, . including New Hampshire, Colorado and Alaska. Trust for America's Health sees room to change that trajectory with the right interventions. 'We have learned . that with a concerted effort you can change the culture of a community, . including its level of physical activity, eating habits, what foods are . offered in schools, and whether families eat together,' said Levi. In New York City, . for instance, obesity for elementary and middle-school students dropped . 5.5 percent from the 2006-07 school year to 2010-11, thanks mostly to . healthier school lunches, public health experts said. 'A lot of this is about making healthy choices easier and not mandating healthier lifestyles,' Levi said .","A new report has been released by the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation based on stats from the CDC .

Military chiefs have been accused of dishonoring the war dead over plans to put 60,000 solar panels on the famous runway at Pearl Harbor's Ford Island. The Navy wants to erect a 7ft tall fence on the site and turn it into what critics claim will be a 'monstrosity' in a bid to make itself more green. It has chosen the site because it claims the airfield is not in use - even though the memory of events still lingers on. Outrage: The Navy plans to install 60,000 blue solar panels on the runway at Pearl Harbour's Ford Island. Critics say the panels (pictured in a mockup for the project) will make it look like the runway's made of Legos . Never forget: Airmen at the Ford Island Naval Air Station watch smoke billow from the USS Shaw which had just been blown up by Japanese bombers during the attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941 . The runway at Ford Island was where the US military tried to launch planes to try and counter attack during the Pearl Harbor raid on December 7, 1941. Some 33 of the 70 craft stationed there were destroyed as Japanese aircraft slaughtered 2,402 Americans and wounded 1,282 during the surprise offensive. In 1964 the runway was designated a National Historic Landmark and its iconic red and white control tower has featured in films such as ‘Pearl Harbor’. Now, however, the Navy wants to disregard all that and turn it into a solar farm. Going green: Solar panels (like those at the Solarmine facility in Taft, California) will help the Navy reach its goal to get 50 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2020 . Ken DeHoff, director of the Pacific Aviation Museum on Ford Island, called for other sites to be considered. He said: 'We totally agree with (the Navy) being green, but we don't think they should do it where Americans spilled their red blood. 'There's plenty of room for them to create this project off to the west, which is just scrub oak and abandoned land.' He added that even though the site has not been maintained since 1999, it was still used by the local community. He said: 'This is an area that the kids play in, and they're going to cover it up and put a 7-foot high fence around it and basically make the place a monstrosity'. In Memoriam: The USS Arizona Memorial that remembers those who lost their lives on December 7, 1941 during the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor . In remembrance: 2,402 Americans died in the Pearl Harbor attacks by the Japanese on December 7, 1941. Edward Boruki, 83, of Massachusetts, a Pearl Harbor survivor, remembers the dead at an event in 2004 . Under the Navy's plan 60,000 of the blue solar panels, which are 4ft by 6ft in size, would be arranged so that they still looked like the runway does now. There would also be a white cross every 1,000ft along the 4,000ft runway to create the effect. Some 14 acres of land adjoining the runway would be developed as part of the $500 million project as the Navy seeks to get 50 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2020. Museum spokeswoman Barbara Bloom said that the new design was awful and claimed 'it's going to look like the runway's made of Lego'. But according to the Navy, the runway is actually an 'inactive space that is ideally located and sized' for a solar farm. Spokeswoman Agnes Tauyan told USA Today that the Navy 'remains committed to balancing our responsibility towards environmental stewardship, energy security and the preservation of historically significant facilities and structures.'","U.S. Navy plans to install 60,000 of the blue solar panels on runway at Pearl Harbor's Ford Island .

But it soon became clear that inside a bundle on the roadside was an abandoned newborn baby girl, alive and wrapped in a towel. The Polish troops on patrol near their Waghez military base took the two-day-old to a medical centre at the base - and called her Pola, after the name of their country. Discovery: Polish soldiers were shocked to discover the baby girl when they arrived to disarm a road side bomb near Waghez, in Afghanistan. They named her 'Pola' after their country . Barren scene: Polish soldiers stand by the location the baby was discovered. Troops were concerned the bundle was a bomb before they discovered her wrapped up inside it . Attention: Medical staff gave the baby a thorough checking over after she was brought back to the Polish military hospital . She was examined by military doctors . after the shock discovery on Wednesday - and soldiers were sent to buy . baby formula, a bottle and a bib. No other people or buildings were found within a one-mile radius, and it was unclear who had left the baby there and why.

This baby crocodile had a particularly nasty surprise after capturing a juicy fish for a snack, only to become lunch for a powerful fish eagle in hot pursuit. The predator became the prey as the eagle - which normally dines on fish and small mammals - swooped in and snatched the young Nile crocodile, before soaring off with the reptile trapped in its sharp claws. It's behind you: The baby crocodile makes its way along the riverbank with a fish in its jaws - apparently unaware of the powerful eagle in pursuit . Mark Sheridan-Johnson, who captured the scene on the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania, said it was the first time he had seen an eagle snatch a crocodile in his nine years as a safari guide. Mr Sheridan-Johnson, 32, who was raised in Tanzania but whose parents come from Newcastle, snapped the photographs on his day off. 'I didn't have any clients to take out that day so I was driving in my land cruiser looking for interesting wildlife to photograph,' he said. 'I saw the fish eagle on the sand bank with something in its beak. 'I noticed it wasn't a fish but was in fact a Nile crocodile. The eagle quickly took off but I got a couple of shots of it flying away.' Predator becomes the prey: The eagle swooped in, grasped the baby crocodile in its sharp claws and took flight . The fish eagle snatched the young Nile crocodile from a riverbank on the Selous Game Reserve in the south of Tanzania . The safari guide said he suspected the bird was a lone individual that had learned how to hunt for crocodiles. 'It certainly knew what it was doing,' he said. When fully grown, Nile crocodiles are fearsome predators known to feed on gazelles, antelope, wildebeest, zebras and even young elephants. But this juvenile croc was no match for the swift eagle, which wasted no time in carrying the young reptile off for its lunch. Safari guide Mark Sheridan-Johnson initially thought the eagle had captured a fish, then realised it was a baby crocodile clenched in the bird's sharp claws . African fish eagles - which have a wing span of up to 8ft - perch in trees and scan areas for potential prey - typically fish. The powerful birds then swoop in and snatch their prey, before returning to the perch to eat the catch .",The eagle swooped on the baby reptile as it made its way along a riverbank on the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania .

With breakfast being the most important meal of the day, it's pleasant to be able to devour it with a smile on your face. And one hen owner had a particularly uplifting morning when her eggs came funny side up. Pauline Whiting, from Newbury, Berks, reached into the chicken coop in her garden to find a smiley-faced shell grinning back at her. Yolk joke: The bizarre markings on five-year-old Harriet the hen's feelgood egg, which her owner found in the chicken coop in her Berkshire garden . She had noticed her five-year-old hen Harriet laying a number of strange-looking eggs as she grew older, but this unusual one took her breath away. The 56-year-old raced inside to show husband Henry the big, happy egg, which measured 3ins by 1.5ins. Mrs Whiting, a dog breeder, then cracked it open and made an extra-satisfying omelette. She believes the appearance of the cheery looking shell was down to the hen's advanced years - as well as her comfortable free-range lifestyle. 'I went to collect the eggs as normal and saw one huge egg,' said Mrs Whiting. Cracking comedy: Pauline Whiting's prize chicken really made her morning with her entertaining egg . 'When I looked closer I saw two shaded . areas on the shell just like a pair of eyes and then a large curve which . made it look like a smiley face. 'Harriet is five-years-old which is . quite old, and that can often mean discoloured eggs or strange shapes. But she has never laid anything like this before. 'It certainly made me smile and I like . to think it was grinning because it was the biggest out of the lot and . looks rather chuffed. 'I couldn’t have kept it because it would have eventually gone off, so we decided to eat it.'","Pauline Whiting made a cracking omelette from the happy egg .

Wolves and mountain lions could soon be a more common sight in densely populated cities in the United States, experts fear. Colonies of coyotes have already established themselves in the suburbs of Chicago. Scientists believe other potentially . dangerous wild animals, including wolves, lions and bears, may soon be . following in their footsteps as they adapt to urban living. Yesterday a mountain lion stretching over 6-feet in size was shot dead by police officers in a residential area of Des Moines, Iowa while roaming just blocks from an elementary school and in a man's backyard. Scroll down for video . Unperturbed: Staff at a downtown Chicago Quizno's sandwich shop in 2007 were stunned to see a coyote lie down in a cooler stocked with fruit juice and soda . Mountain lions have been sighted on the fringes of American cities, with one shot near the Wrigleyville neighbourhood of Chicago. 'The coyote is the test case for other animals,' said Dr Stan Gehrt, from Ohio State University, who has been tracking the wild dogs. 'Racoons, skunks, foxes - they’ve already been able to penetrate the urban landscape pretty well. The coyote is the most recent and largest. The jury’s out with what’s going to happen with the bigger ones. They are going to be an even bigger challenge.' Suburban animal: Colonies of coyotes have already established themselves in the suburbs of Chicago . Helping hand: Rescuers try and fish the animal out of Lake Michigan . For at least six years, one small . coyote community five miles from Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport . has remained within a territory covering just a third of a square mile. 'That’s . an indication that they don’t have to go far to find food and water,' said Dr Gehrt. 'They’re finding everything they need right there, in the . suburbs of Chicago. It amazes me.' He estimates that about 2,000 coyotes live in the city’s metro area, along with nine million people in 250 municipalities. People living in urban areas are going to have to get used to predators on their doorstep, says Dr Gehrt. He added: 'It used to be rural areas . where we would have this challenge of coexistence versus conflict with . carnivores. In the future, and I would say currently, it’s cities where . we’re going to have this intersection between people and carnivores. Killed: This mountain lion stretching 6ft, 4in in size was shot and killed in a residential area of Des Moines, Iowa on Thursday morning . Close inspection: An officer inspects the cat that was reported seen prowling in a man's backyard around 9.30am . 'We . used to think only little carnivores could live in cities, and even . then we thought they couldn’t really achieve large numbers. But we’re . finding that these animals are much more flexible than we gave them . credit for and they’re adjusting to our cities. 'That’s going to put the burden back . on us. Are we going to be able to adjust to them living with us or are . we not going to be able to coexist?' Earlier this year police shot dead a mountain lion after it wandered into the downtown area of a busy city. The large cat was found by a janitor in the courtyard of an office building near a popular open-air mall, the Third Street Promenade, in Santa Monica, California near a preschool, church and other businesses. Authorities made multiple attempts to try and subdue the young male cat, including use of a tranquilizer and a pepper ball, according to Capt Daniel Sforza of the Fish and Game Department. Found: In May this year a young mountain lion roamed a courtyard near an open-air mall in Santa Monica, California . 'Unusual': An officer carries guns away after police shot and killed the lion after failing to subdue the cat . 'Risk': Police tried to use a tranquilizer and pepper ball to slow the cat instead of killing him before the animal was shot and carried off by authorities into a truck . Dr Gehrt issued his warning at the EcoSummit 2012 meeting taking place in Columbus, Ohio. He pointed out that historically, one reason people moved out of remote areas was to get away from dangerous large predators. 'The funny thing is that now we have more people on earth and bigger cities than ever, we also now have carnivores moving into cities,' said Dr Gehrt. 'It’s a two-way street. We’re expanding cities into their territories and they’re also coming in.' Coyotes can be helpful by hunting rodents and rabbits, but will also eat the occasional cat or small dog, he said. The animals do not usually attack humans. Waving arms, shouting, or throwing a rock will usually scare a threatening coyote away, said Dr Gehrt.

Drewitt-Barlow, who have had five children by a surrogate, were travelling back from Essex Fashion week when a river bank flooded and they became immersed in water 5ft deep. They were rescued from the roof of their brand new Range Rover after clambering out of the window as the car started to fill up with water. Today, Barrie told MailOnline: 'The car started filling up with water and it went dark. We had to climb out of the window. I thought I was going to die.' Gay parents Barrie & Tony Drewitt-Barlow were rescued from the roof of their Range Rover yesterday morning after it became immersed in 5ft of water . Stranded: The couple were discovered in the dark by passing fire and rescue teams . A rescue boat came to collect the pair from the flooded lane in Essex and take them back to safety . The couple, wearing tuxedoes, were rescued just after . midnight yesterday by a fire crew after Tony called 999. It took approximately 15 firefighters nearly an hour to rescue them and take them to safety in Chelmsford, Essex. Tony, 48, and Barrie, 43, were forced to abandon their possessions in the car, including a laptop and photo albums, which they say have now been stolen. They are offering a £5,000 reward for anyone who finds them. The fathers were heading back from filming with the Only Way is Essex stars at Essex Fashion Week. Barrie told MailOnline: 'We had just finished a meal out with friends after the fashion week and were heading home. We had just dropped Saffron off at her friends house, thank God. 'We had driven down the lane only an hour and a half before and it was clear so we drove through the ford as normal when all of a sudden the bank flooded and water came at us spinning the car around three times. 'The car started filling up with water and it went dark. Tony called 999 and stayed on the phone with them until the fire services arrived. 'We had to climb out of the window. I thought I was going to die.' 'We went back yesterday to rescue some personal belongings from the boot, a couple of photo albums, clothes, and my laptop, but they had all been stolen. My laptop had all of our photos on. 'We have put a £5000 reward up for the return of the photos and laptop.' Tony is suffering from shock and hypothermia at the moment from having over an hour on the roof.' It took nearly an hour and 15 firefighters to get the couple to dry land . Barrie, left, and Tony Drewitt-Barlow, right, carry their twins Jasper, left, and Dallas, right, away from St. John the Baptist Church in Danbury, Essex, following their christening service in 2010 . The incident happened on a lane near Danbury, Chelmsford, Essex at 00.13 yesterday morning. As . a police helicopter used its searchlights, firefighters had to use an . inflatable boat to rescue the men and row the fathers back to dry land. A . spokesman from Essex Fire and Rescue Service told MailOnline yesterday: 'A fire . crew found the men on their car in the flooded road at 00.13 this . morning and took them to safety.' The couple, from Maldon in Essex, first hit the headlines in 1999 when they became the first British same-sex couple to be named on their children's birth certificates. Twins Aspen and Saffron were born to a surrogate mother in California. Following . a ruling by an American court, they became the first British children . to be registered as having two fathers and no mother. Four years later, the Drewitt-Barlows used the same egg donor and a different surrogate to have another child, Orlando. In 2010 the couple welcomed their fourth and fifth children into the world. Twin boys Dallas and Jasper were born to the same surrogate mother who carried Orlando. The couple, who have made millions from cosmetic research, entered into a civil partnership in 2006. The couple sold their clinical testing business in 1998 and found themselves swamped by same-sex couples seeking advice. The couple are pictured back on dry land following the incident in the early hours of this morning . Immersed: The Range Rover pictured in the morning light .

So with Tony’s clinical expertise, they set up the British Surrogacy Centre in Maldon, Essex, in February 2011, where they were able to share their surrogacy knowledge with others. Last year, the couple, who have made . millions from cosmetic research, were accused of fabricating the test . results in clinical trials.

A tycoon wants to build 320 homes in the middle of ‘Bronte country’ – a prospect that has alarmed conservationists. They say the development would be ‘disturbingly close’ to Haworth Moor in West Yorkshire, which was so vividly described in the 19th Century writings of sisters Emily, Charlotte and Anne Bronte. Rugged landscape: The moors of West Yorkshire were vividly described in Emily Bronte's classic novel Wuthering Heights . Artist's impression: The Bronte Society has said the landscape must be protected . It was also the setting for Emily’s doomed love story about Heathcliff and Cathy Earnshaw. Bradford businessman Perves Abbas, who initially wants 120 homes on land bordering the moor, is to submit a planning application in the next month. He said: ‘I will take everything into consideration to make sure the local beauty is not lost.’ But Christine Went, heritage and conservation officer for the Bronte Society, said: ‘Large numbers of new houses would bring inappropriate development disturbingly close to the moorland fringes. We have to protect this landscape.’ Atmospheric: Actress Kaya Scodelario as Cathy Earnshaw in a 2011 film version of Wuthering Heights, set on the misty West Yorkshire moors .

A routine child welfare investigation led to the discovery of a toddler's corpse buried in a grave in the backyard of a Long Island home on Saturday. State police unearthed the remains outside a tidy house in Farmingdale after Officials with Suffolk County's Child Protective Services visited the family and realizing one of the couple’s three boys was missing. They grew concerned when the family couldn't account for the whereabouts of a child born in 2009. Scroll down for video . Secret burial: The body of a 17-month-old boy was found buried in this 3-foot-deep grave in a Long Island home's backyard on Saturday . Shocking find: The boy was discovered in the backyard of this home after child protective services visited the family and inquired where their youngest born in 2009 was . Investigation's end: After obtaining a search warrant for the home following an interview with the residents, officers found the boy's body resting along this fence line . Police say the boy’s mother Heather Kowalczik admitted her son, Justin Kowalczik, who was about 17-months old, died two years ago after the family moved to Farmingdale from Orange County. After further probing she revealed a possible location for his body. 'It is absolutely a suspicious death and it is being investigated as such,' said State Police Major Patrick Regan. 'We don't have a cause of death, and to our knowledge, there was never a report made of the child being missing.' Obtaining a search warrant and investigating the property’s backyard, it was there on the fence line they found the boy in a 3-foot grave resting near a soccer goal and children's toys. The circumstances of his death remained unclear Saturday while foul play is not immediately suspected. Justin, the youngest half-brother of two older boys – Robert, 9, and Alex, 6 – died in the summer of 2010, according to police.  Authorities said it’s still unclear why the family kept it a secret. Questioned: The boy's mother Heather Kowalczik, left, is seen along with her boyfriend and the father of two of her oldest boys, Robert Rodriguez, who is a person of interest . Backyard party: Neighbours were shocked by the news saying they had celebrated one of the home's two surviving boy's birthday in the backyard in August . Chasing leads: State Police officers arrived in the dead of night to dig in the backyard after interviewing the boy's mother . Police have listed Kowalczik’s boyfriend, Robert Rodriguez who is the father of her two older boys, as a person of interest. On Friday, police released an Amber Alert for the oldest boy, Robert, after he failed to show up for school and Rodriguez was also found missing. He was later recovered safely . As of Saturday afternoon, Rodriguez has refused to answer questions, Regan said. 'He did not come in willingly. He is not cooperating,' Regan said. Neither Rodriguez nor Kowalczik had been charged with any crimes. Root of the crime: Officers have made no arrests at this time though the boyfriend of the 17-month-old's mother is considered a person of interest while not cooperating with authorities . Other brothers: Officers said that the 17-month-old's surviving half-siblings, two boys, are currently in custody of county child welfare agents . Kowalczik's two surviving children were in the custody of county child welfare agents, police said. Neighbour Tekiera McCormack told Newsday that she was stunned. 'I can't see this,' she told the newspaper. 'This is crazy. She was a good mother. Those kids loved her.'

Green rules coming from the EU threaten to plunge Britain into 1970s-style blackouts in three years and lead to energy bills doubling. Millions could be pushed into fuel poverty – having to choose between heating or eating – because Brussels diktats are closing power stations needlessly, the Government’s energy regulator warned yesterday. The plants that remain in Britain will not be able to keep up with demand by winter 2015, a dire report from Ofgem predicted. Didcot power station: The station will close in 2013, further reducing the UK's power independence . The chance of blackouts, similar to . those seen during the three-day week crisis of the 1970s, is currently . rated as one in 3,300 by the energy regulator. But it could drop to as . low as one in 12 over the next three years, Ofgem said. The UK’s spare generating capacity, . currently 14 per cent, could drop to 4 per cent or even shrink to . nothing at the same time, it warned. The ‘alarming’ findings have left . senior figures in the energy industry desperately worried, sources say, . as the vast scale of the challenges facing the UK’s energy future . becomes clear. If the report’s predictions come true, . Britain could be left dependent on an unreliable undersea cable line . with France for its emergency energy supply. National Grid and the Government could . order mothballed generating plants to fire up again to plug the energy . gap. The battle to keep the lights on could then become a stand-off . between British ministers trying to keep the country running and . European bureaucrats trying to enforce rulings on the UK. Ofgem said the UK faced ‘an . unprecedented combination of the global financial crisis, tough . environmental targets and the closure of ageing power stations that . would increase the risk to consumers’ energy supplies and could lead to . higher bills’. Audrey Gallacher, director of Energy . at Consumer Focus, said: 'While there is enough generation capacity to . mean that widespread power-cuts are still unlikely, narrower margins . mean the risks of outages are higher and scarcity of energy could also . feed into possible price rises in future. 'Consumers need protection from price spikes as well as power cuts. ‘Action is needed to guarantee the secure energy supply the UK has enjoyed for decades. 'It . is right that we close our oldest and most polluting energy plants, but . it is essential that new initiatives deliver investment in alternative . energy generation to meet this gap. 'At . the same time however consumers cannot write a blank cheque to cover . the costs of new energy. To avoid this happening the Government and . regulator must ensure that the costs passed onto consumers are fully . transparent and rigorously scrutinised. 'We . also need to see energy efficiency programmes being delivered as widely . and effectively as possible. Making our housing stock more energy . efficient not only cuts demand and provides a greater margin with our . supply – it also provides much-needed reductions in consumers' bills.' The report warned that there ‘will be a . significant reduction in electricity supplies from coal and oil plants . over the period, primarily driven by closures required by European . environmental legislation’. It added: ‘The risk of electricity shortfalls is expected to be highest at the end of the period, in 2015-16 and 2016-17.’ The most damaging piece of EU ‘green . tape’, industry insiders say, is a 2001 measure designed to limit . emissions for older power stations. The Large Combustion Plant Directive . forces all coal or oil-fired power plants built before 1987 to install . expensive emissions-reducing equipment or face closure by 2015. It was spawned out of the Brussels . obsession with weaning all European countries off coal power. But . because of Britain’s rich mining heritage, it is a measure that hits the . UK harder than any other EU member.  Nine of the UK’s coal and . oil-fired power stations are destined to shut by 2015. This represents . about 15 per cent of the UK’s total generating capacity. This would . leave Britain dependent on imported gas – which comes with a notoriously . volatile price tag. Dark future: Ofgem warned that due to the new EU rules closing power stations Britain may have to face 1970s blackouts by 2015 . Respected energy analyst Peter . Atherton said: ‘What’s difficult now is that there is legislation in . place that will shut down plants deliberately. There are very good . plants that are being ordered to shut before they should. The rest of . the coal fleet is under a sentence of death.’ At the moment market energy prices are . about £50 per megawatt hour – the unit used to measure power. Mr . Atherton said prices could ‘easily’ hit £100 per megawatt hour in 2015. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said the Government would respond to the . report before the end of the year. He said: ‘Security of electricity . supply is of critical importance to the health of the economy and the . smooth functioning of our daily lives.’ Consumer groups called on the . Government to protect homeowners from ever-rising bills. Richard Lloyd, . director of consumer group Which?, said: ‘It’s alarming to hear Ofgem . predicting that we could be relying more on imported gas in a matter of . years which could mean further price rises for hard-pressed consumers.’ ÷ Britons are among the world’s . biggest climate change sceptics, a poll found. Only 63 per cent believe . global warming has been scientifically proven, according to the survey . of 13 countries for insurance firm Axa. Only Japan had more dissent. The stark warning that  the lights in Britain could go out within three years, as  a result of the country’s  mad dash towards a greener energy policy, is a terrible indictment of the prevarication  and zigzags of government policy  on energy. Warnings that Britain’s energy supplies were on a knife-edge were frequent during Labour’s 13 years in office, but it was not until the dying months of Gordon Brown’s administration that Downing Street finally committed to new nuclear. And while the dithering went on, the European Union continually tightened environmental standards, further undermining Britain’s energy security. The coal-fired power station at Drax, North Yorkshire, will have to come off line, but plans to replace it with biomass or cleaner coal have failed to come to fruition and new nuclear is still on the drawing board. As for wind-power and coastal energy turbines, so favoured by the Coalition when it came to office, the generous subsidies are being removed making it a much less attractive investment for the big six energy companies. Meanwhile, so far the Coalition has failed to come up with a pricing policy that makes development of a new generation of nuclear power stations sufficiently attractive to the foreign investors on whom the UK is relying. Now, Energy Secretary Ed Davey’s new ‘dash for gas’ is expected to be at the centre of the Energy Bill due before the Commons shortly. But experts point out that some of the UK’s mothballed gas power stations could take years to come back on line and new capacity will take upwards of four years to build. Most worrying of all, by placing so much emphasis on gas Britain exposes itself to the vicissitudes of the global energy market. British-owned Centrica has taken a number of steps to secure gas supplies through the Norwegian Langeled gas pipeline and by securing long-term  liquid natural gas contracts with  Qatar – a Middle East ally with some  of the largest natural gas reserves in the world. But as the UK has found in the  past, when Russia closed off gas  pipelines through Ukraine, power  supplies are at the mercy of events beyond our control. Unlike other trading nations, such as Holland, the UK has failed to build sufficient storage capacity to see us through a prolonged geo-political crisis. The most positive thing that can be said of the warning from Ofgem is that it may finally galvanise Whitehall and a fractured government into action. Big global power companies such as Electricite de France, which owns British Energy’s nuclear stations, will have  to be offered a firm promise of a generous base price if new nuclear is finally to go ahead. But it could be at least a decade  before that power comes on stream.  If the interim solution is more gas,  consumers will once again find  themselves at the mercy of market prices. In recent times wholesale gas  prices have started to come down because of new American extraction techniques known as ‘fracking’. This  has made the US almost self-sufficient. That ought to make gas supplies more plentiful. But relying on imported energy, at a time when the Middle East is in flames, can hardly be regarded as looking after the nation’s economic or national security.","Spare energy capacity could drop to just four per cent by winter 2015 .

This is the white-knuckle moment a boat was nearly flipped over when its crew faced a huge 35ft wave head-on. The 38ft pilot vessel was picked up by the enormous roller off the Irish coast and teetered at a perilous 60-degree angle before coming down safely on the other side. It took all the skill of helmsman Cairan Monks to keep the vessel square on to the wave. Had he been even slightly off course his craft would have capsized. On the edge: Incredible images show a pilot vessel put through its paces off the Irish coast . Incredibly, the crew deliberately took to sea during the force 10 storm in order to put the pilot vessel through its paces. 'Pilots' are experienced sailors who use their knowledge of local waters to guide large ships into and out of port. Pilot boats have existed in various forms for centuries, as a means of transporting pilots between the shore and incoming ships. They need to be able to withstand the very worst weather to guide other ships to safety. Many also serve as search-and-rescue vessels. Batten down the hatches! The 38-foot vessel is dwarfed by the approaching roller . Nerves of steel: Helmsman Cairan Monks used all his skill to keep the boat at right-angles to the wave . Engulfed: The vessel is nearly swamped as it surges through the heavy sea . The images - compared by some to scenes out of the George Clooney movie the Perfect Storm - were captured on camera by Frank Kowalski. Mr Kowalski runs a pilot vessel supply company and was on another larger boat that tackled the same wave seconds after he took the pictures in the Celtic Sea. Mr Kowalski, 50, said: 'We supply many vessels to French and Portugese ports that are open to large Biscay swells and are expected to withstand such severe conditions. 'Although it was a bad day weather wise it was a good opportunity to see how this Interceptor 38 model performed. 'It was critical for Cairan to be absolutely square on to that wave and a great deal of skill and care was required to keep it that way. 'In those extreme conditions it would have been easy to make a mistake and expose her beam to the big breaker and risk being capsized. White-knuckle ride: The boat's bow points skywards breaks through the crest of the wave . Uncertain: Teetering for a split-second, the craft could have fallen forward or back . Relief: The resilient boat crests the wave and regains its balance . 'The Interceptor 38 is in fact self-righting but we weren’t looking to put it through that test on this day. 'I was stood on the bow of a larger boat behind it taking some photos. 'The vessel was in the right position for long enough for me to get a couple of good shots. Like in the movies: Frank Kowalski's photos have been compared to George Clooney disaster movie The Perfect Storm (pictured) 'It must have been at an angle of 60 degrees and would have been like riding a thrill ride for Cairan.

Najat Hamza, Abu Hamza's wife, pictured, has been asked to leave her taxpayer-funded council house . Hate preacher Abu Hamza’s wife has been asked by her local authority to move out of the five-bedroom council house she lives in. Moroccan-born Najat Mostafa is believed to live at the large Shepherd’s Bush property in west London with only two of the couple's eight children after reportedly moving there in 1995. Hammersmith and Fulham Council says that in recent weeks it has corresponded with Mrs Mostafa and asked her to move to a 'more appropriate property'. But the radical cleric's Hamza’s second wife is entitled to refuse the council’s request, as there is no time limit on her tenancy agreement. News of the council’s request comes after Mrs Mostafa’s husband was extradited to the US on Friday after years of legal wrangling to face terrorism charges. The 55-year-old will appear in court in New York today for a plea hearing. A spokesman for Hammersmith and Fulham Council said: 'I can confirm that we have corresponded with Mrs Mostafa with regards to her tenancy. 'We believe this home is too big for the number of family members who currently live there and, with over 10,000 people languishing on the borough’s housing waiting list, she should move to a more appropriate property.' Their demand comes after Greg Hands, the Conservative MP for Fulham . and Chelsea, told The Daily Telegraph: 'I would strongly welcome any . move by the council to take a look at Hamza's wife's status and the . large council house in one of London's wealthiest neighbourhoods to see . whether something might be done to move Hamza's family on.' This is the West London home where Abu Hamza's wife is reported to live with two of her their children . Not guilty plea: Defence lawyer Jeremy Schneider (left) and Abu Hamza (centre) in court in New York City . The spokesman could not confirm the exact value of the property, but said house prices in Hammersmith and Fulham are among the most expensive in Britain. Abu Hamza pleaded not guilty today . to charges that he conspired with U.S. men to set up a terrorist . training camp in Oregon state. He entered the plea shortly before U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest set an August 26 trial date for him. Hamza is also accused of helping abduct 16 hostages, two of them American tourists, in Yemen in 1998. Hamza, who is missing boths hands and an eye, never officially lived in the Shepherd's Bush house but was often seen there by neighbours before his arrest in August 2004 for incitement to murder and racial hatred. In 2006 he was jailed for seven years. His wife moved into it in 1995 after claiming they had separated. Police raided his council-owned house in 2004 and found thousands of extremist video and audio tapes ready for distribution. In 2006 it emerged he had bought a four-bedroom semi in Greenford for £220,000 cash while in prison. At the same time the Islamist extremist was running up a legal aid bill which had then cost the taxpayer £250,000, and the property was later seized to  claw back some of the cash. Hook-handed Hamza first faced an extradition request from the Americans in 2004 and was jailed in the UK in 2006 for seven years for soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred.

The Kenyan half-brother of President Obama has been sued by his girlfriend for allegedly kidnapping their son so he could take him to the United States. George Obama, 30, allegedly snatched the three-year-old boy from his girlfriend's home in the Huruma slum, Nairobi on September 6 and still has not returned him, she told a court in the city. She claims that Obama, who is one of the president's seven half-siblings on his father's side, plans to take the child to the U.S. where is mother lives and 'where education is free'. But a judge banned has him from doing so and said he must bring the boy to court on October 31. Accused: President Obama's younger brother George, pictured, allegedly kidnapped his son from his girlfriend's home in Nairobi, Kenya and has refused to return him . The unidentified 30-year-old girlfriend said she took the issue to the courts after she was unable to track down her son following his birthday party on Saturday, the Daily Nation reported. Mr Obama, who does not live with his girlfriend, arrived at the house in a taxi and said he wanted to take the boy with him to buy a birthday present, the court heard. She said the boy could only go if her mother and sister travelled with them, but as the women got into the taxi, Mr Obama threw them out, his girlfriend claimed. He then drove off with the child, who has not been returned, she added. Related: President Barack Obama, left, and George Obama, right, share the same father . A world away: George Obama has previously defended his slum home and said he does not mind that his brother has not supported him financially as 'he has his own family to take care of' Her lawyer, John Chigiti, added that Mr Obama planned to take his son to the United States where his mother, Jael Otieno, lives in Atlanta. 'The defendant informed me that he wants to take the child to America to his mother where education is free,' the lawyer said, according to the Daily Nation. How easy this journey would be is unclear; in 2010, George Obama's request for a tourist visa into U.S. was refused. The girlfriend argued that the boy's travelling to the U.S would not be in his best interests. It is not the first time George Obama has been in trouble with the law.

He also made headlines this summer for appearing in the conservative film '2016: Obama’s America,' in which he refused to criticise his half-brother for failing to financially support him. 'I think he has a family of his own, he's supposed to help his family,' George said in the film. 'I'm part of his family, but I'm over-age so I can help myself. He’s got other issues to deal with. He’s taking care of the world, so he’s taking care of me.' Ruling: A file picture of the court in Nairobi, where George Obama must take his son at the end of the month . Although the amount his girlfriend is suing him for in court has not been specified, she is perhaps trying to get her hands on some of the $1,000 he received from the director after the interview. Dinesh D'Souza told Fox News he had sent the money to cover hospital bills for Obama's child, who was in hospital for a chest infection, but it is a hefty amount in the country and far exceeds the cost of medical care in the area. Barack Obama, who is 20 years older than his half brother, was born in Hawaii by a different mother, Ann Dunham, who was white with various European ancestry.

Animal rights campaigners have claimed dairy calves only days old are being shot to feed hunt hounds. Undercover footage by campaigners shows a young male being shot in the head as it stands on a pile of calf carcasses in a trailer. The farm in Bristol shown in the film supplies milk to Cadbury, which makes 250million bars of chocolate each year. 'Executed': Undercover footage by campaigners shows a young male calf being shot in the head as it stands on a pile of calf carcasses in a trailer . Dead: The man leans in to finish the job . Male calves are virtually useless to farmers as they do not provide milk and there is little demand to buy them. Campaigners claim the calf is one of around 100,000 male dairy animals executed shortly after birth each year as there is no market for them. The undercover film-makers from Viva! claim the calf was shot by a member of Beaufort Hunt. This was regularly attended by members of the Royal Family including Prince Charles and his sons William and Harry before the 2004 foxhunting ban. The calf’s corpse was later taken away to be fed to the hounds. The footage was secretly recorded by animal welfare activists who infiltrated a number of farms which supply milk to the confectionery industry. Despite the distressing images, none of the actions seen in the film are illegal. Used for food: Workers discuss how to dispose of the dead animals . Royal connection: Prince Charles on the Beaufort Hunt in 1999. He and his sons William and Harry regularly attended before the 2004 foxhunting ban . Dairy cows must be impregnated yearly to produce milk for human consumption but many of the male calves born are deemed surplus as demand for veal is limited. They are shot soon after birth and turned into pet food or other low-value products. Speaking after the footage was released, Viva! campaigner Kat Affleck said: ‘Consumers have a right to know the brutal truth that Cadbury’s would rather keep quiet, how dairy products are produced. ‘The cruel parental separation and shooting of thousands of male dairy calves hardly fits in with their picturesque pastoral image. ‘One hundred thousand shots ring out on dairy farms every year because of unwanted males. Sadly virtually all milk, has similar provenance. The cruelty is inherent to the industry.’ Ian Farquhar, joint master of the Beaufort Hunt, last night said the hunt was ‘helping out the farming community’ to deal with unwanted calves. He said: ‘It is not a question of being cruel. I was a farmer when calves were raised and put into the food chain. But through EU legislation and DEFRA policy, there is no longer a market for them. Death row: The video shows the cruel treatment the animals are subjected to before they are killed . Farm workers prepare to dispose of the carcasses of animals they've killed . Food chain: The farm shown in the film supplies milk to Cadbury, which makes 250million bars of chocolate each year . ‘It has nothing to do with the hunts. It is simply non-viable for the farmers to raise calves. ‘The hunts who still collect calves are doing it purely for the benefit of the farmer. We do not enjoy it, it is simply a case of the rural community helping each other out.’ A spokesman for Kraft, Cadbury’s parent company, said the firm took animal welfare ‘very seriously’ and said it was an out-of-the-ordinary incident. The spokesman said this particular calf had a deformed leg. He was taken from the farm by a licensed slaughterer from the Beaufort Hunt Kennels and dealt with humanely. He said: ‘We purchase milk from hundreds of farms across the UK. This video is 18 months old and, at the time it was released, we said we took animal welfare very seriously and nothing has changed.’","Campaigners' undercover footage shows shooting .

After winning a competition to be the Military Family of the Game, Tammy Faile, 41, and her two children Breanna, 15, and Cameron, 10, were over the moon about receiving a message from Sgt. Faile from his posting in South Korea. But after the message had been played on the big screen, an even bigger surprise awaited them as Sgt. Faile stepped onto the stadium in full camouflage gear to greet his family in person. Scroll down for video . Surprise! Tammy, Breanna and Cameron run to hug Sergeant Scott Faile after he walks onto the pitch . A very emotional video recording of the Sergeant First Class's stunt was posted on YouTube this weekend, and has been viewed over 383,400 times in three days. It shows Tammy, Breanna and Cameron being cheered on by the 86,000 strong crowd which had gathered at the stadium on Saturday to watch the game between Scott Faile’s favourite team, the South Carolina Gamecocks, and the University of Georgia’s Bulldogs. After the announcer introduces the family and the message from Sgt. Faile, emotions overcome mother and children as they watch their beloved family member greet them from his base in South Korea. ‘Hey guys, I love you and I miss you,’ Sgt Faile, from Kershaw, South Carolina is heard saying in his message. ‘I really would like to be there to watch the Gamecocks beat up on Georgia. Just keep in mind my tour is over soon.’ Honoured: The family had been led to believe they had won the Military Family of the Game competition where one family of a soldier is recognised each game in front of the crowd . Plan: The message which appeared on the big screens at the stadium had been recorded before Sgt Faile returned from South Korea . 'I love you': Emotions run high as Cameron, Breanna and Tammy watch Sgt Faile's message on the big screen . What his emotional family does not know is that although the message is from South Korea, Sgt. Faile himself is only feet away from them, preparing his surprise entrance. As he walks onto the stadium, Breanna can be seen shouting ‘Oh my God!‘ before she starts running towards her father – but in a bid to get to her husband before her daughter Tammy grabs her by her Gamecocks shirt, pulling her back. ‘Once I saw him, I didn't hear anything else,’ Mrs Faile told WLTX. ‘That was it. It could have been completely silent or it could have been louder than what it was and I never would have heard it. It was like everything else was drowned out.’ On the subject of being outrun by her mother 15-year-old Breanna joked that she tried to get there first but that ‘definitely didn't happen because some people were trying to trip me up.’ Despite thousands of ecstatic people screaming around them, it appears once they were reunited nothing else existed for the Failes as they eventually had to be asked to move to make way for the marching band. 'Oh my God': Breanna, Tammy and Cameron cannot believe their eyes as they realise that it is in fact their husband and father walking towards them . Surprise: Cameron, Breanna and Tammy Faile gasp as they spot Sgt Faile walking out of the tunnel and onto the pitch to surprise them . Competition: Tammy tugs her daughter's shirt in order to beat her as they run towards the edge of the pitch . ‘I had absolutely no idea. I mean, I didn’t even have a thought. That’s what just made it so overwhelming,’ Sgt Faile said to ABCNews about walking onto the pitch and hearing the crowd’s reaction. ‘I think the entire stadium was in tears. Over 85,000 people were in tears.’ The fact that the video of the family has become an internet hit was never part of Sgt Faile’s elaborate scheme. ‘I was just doing something for the family, and I guess it just kind of spun out of control.’ He spent three months planning the surprise with the help of Kaela Harmon, public relations manager with Columbia Metropolitan Airport and the University of South Carolina. Homecoming: Scott Faile finally gets to see his family after 12 months in South Korea . 'It was perfect timing, they had no idea. I told them that I had entered them on the SEC [Southeastern Conference] website, which was total fiction.’ His wife and children are equally amazed by the attention. ‘We’re just over the moon,’ Mrs Faile said. ‘He’s such an awesome man. For him to do something like this, the words that he said on that video, he just completely blew me away. ‘I know how wonderful he is, but now the whole world knows.’ Sgt. Faile had returned home from South Korea, after completing his third tour of duty. He had previously served in Afghanistan and Kuwait. The family is now stationed in Augusta, Georgia.",Video of emotional reunion of the Faile family at University of Carolina football game goes viral .

As Martinez mock fired the guns, Riascos played dead and started falling to the ground. Once down on the pitch, Riascos followed up the unusual display with some retro dancing by performing the worm - blissfully unaware his fellow player Martinez was being shown the red card by referee Jose Alfredo Penaloza.

A man was beaten with a rounders bat for his bank card and laptop before being 'slowly tortured to death' with knives and broken bottles, dumped in a wheelie bin and set on fire, a court heard. 'Vulnerable' Jamie Dack, 22, was lured to a squat in Southampton and beaten by three men and a woman who stole his debit card and PIN number and used them to withdraw just £20 to fund a night out. The 'cold-blooded' gang - afraid their victim would go to the police - kept him in the flat overnight where they later tortured him to death over several hours using broken glass and kitchen knives, before setting his body alight in a prolonged and 'positively chilling' attack, Winchester Crown Court was told. 'Vicious': Jamie Dack, 22, was 'slowly tortured to death' at a flat in Southampton, a court was told . Mr Dack's body was found in a metal waste bin in on an industrial estate in Southampton on Easter Sunday. A post-mortem examination revealed he had been stabbed several times in the neck, shoulder, chest, stomach and leg, but his body was so badly burned the true extent of his injuries will never be known, the court heard. Donna Chalk, 21, Ryan Woodmansey, 32, Lee Nicholls, 28, and Andrew Dwyer-Skeats, 26, all deny murdering the 22-year-old on April 6. The jury at Winchester Crown Court was told the Southampton flat where the alleged murder took place was being used as a squat by Chalk and her boyfriend Dwyer-Skeats, who Mr Dack had got to know while living in the city. Investigation: Firefighters found Mr Dack's badly burned remains when they were called to put out a fire at the Southampton industrial estate . Prosecutor Christopher Parker QC said the defendants had targeted the 22-year-old's bank card and laptop after meeting up with him on Thursday April 5, to help fund a planned night out at a rave in Bournemouth. 'Mr Dack was beaten up in the bedroom with a rounders bat and his debit card was stolen from him and taken to a cash machine. Woodmansey got £20 from the machine,' Mr Parker said. 'Overnight, Mr Dack was kept in the flat and was never to leave it alive again.' 'On the Friday, he was left in the flat probably bound and gagged. These four defendants went out and sold his laptop. 'What happened next in cold blood is . they tortured him to death in the kitchen of the flat using fists and . feet, stabbing him with broken bottles and kitchen knives - altogether . as a group. 'Not everybody necessarily wielding . the bottle, not everybody necessarily wielding the knife, but those who . did not deliberately encouraged those who carried out the fatal . killing,' the barrister said. The next day the gang 'regrouped' and allegedly wheeled Mr Dack and a . blood-soaked carpet through the streets in wheelie bins before finding . the metal bin on an industrial estate, dousing his body in petrol and . setting it alight. It was done to 'systematically' try to hide what they had done, the prosecutor told the jury. Mr Dack knew the four and had been attacked by one of them the previous month over unfounded claims he had been a 'sex pest' to a girl, the court heard. Mr Parker went on: 'We say that each of these defendants, in each of his or her own way, was involved in that joint enterprise killing of Jamie. 'By their actions, or by their encouragement, they took part in a vicious and degrading attack on a young, vulnerable victim.' Firefighters found the badly burned remains when they were called to put out the fire in the early hours of April 8. Chalk also denies perverting the course of justice by disposing of the body and setting it alight. The jury was told that the three men have pleaded guilty to the charge of perverting the course of justice. The trial is expected to last seven weeks.

An anguished father says he was saddened to receive an 'impersonal’ form letter from the president regarding the death of his son in Afghanistan - as it is revealed that the White House has been sending the same exact letters to families of fallen troops for years. Back in January, Tom Logan, of Willis, Texas, was ecstatic when it appeared that his son, USMC Cpl Joseph Logan, had come home on a surprise visit. But the man at the door that day was not Joseph. He was a fellow Marine who had come to deliver the heartbreaking news that Mr Logan’s youngest son had been killed in action. Heartbreak: Four months after his son's death, Tom Logan said he was saddened all over again when a UPS delivery truck brought a letter of condolence from President Obama . Cpl Logan was one of six Marines who were killed when a chopper went down in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province on January 19. 'He was a good kid,' Mr Logan told KPRC while fighting back tears, 'and he’s not going to come back anymore.' But four months after his death, Mr Logan said he was saddened all over again when a UPS delivery truck brought a letter of condolence from President Obama. Speaking to KPRC in Houston, Mr Logan called it a form letter that was 'impersonal' and 'disrespectful.' Carbon copies: An investigation by KPRC found that the letters sent by the White House to the families of fallen troops are carbon copies of each other- except for names and ranks . Fallen: Cpl Joseph Logan was one of six Marines who were killed when a chopper went down in Afghanistan's Helmand Province on January 19 . Form letters have been used to delivers condolences to bereaved families of servicemen for many years. However Mr Logan told the station: ‘It opened up a . wound - a hole in our heart that you can’t fix. You can’t send another . letter. You can't make it right.' A subsequent investigation by KPRC found that the letters sent by the White House to the families of fallen troops are carbon copies of each other- except for names and ranks. In addition, Gateway Pundit found that the same form letters date back as far as 2009 for soldiers, Navy SEALs and Marines. Nancy Beck Young, a professor and historian at the University of Houston, said different presidents have approached the task of writing such letters in line with their personalities and priorities. All the same: A separate investigation by Gateway Pundit found that the same form letters date back as far as 2009 for fallen soldiers, Navy SEALs and Marines . After examining the letter written to Mr . Logan, she said: 'I would agree, this is a personal sacrifice and an . impersonal condolence.' Young said that it appears Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, wrote more personalised notes, some of them hand-written. Form letters, she added, were a trait of the modern age. 'I think it's an indication of how the office of the presidency works in the early 21st century,' she told KPRC in Houston. Mr Logan believes it should never work that way. 'Where are the representatives of our . government? Where is the honor and the respect that all of these . soldiers deserve?' he said.

A man has been spared jail after he hid a camera in his shopping basket to film up women's skirts in a supermarket, a court heard today. Timothy Cordell, 56, smuggled the device inside a tablet box and propped it up using a bottle of milk, before prowling the aisles of a Sainsbury's store to get footage of unsuspecting women's underwear. His scheme was uncovered when customers complained to staff about Cordell sidling up to them and the bizarre way he was holding his shopping basket. Sneaky: Timothy Cordell hid a camera inside his shopping basket and used it to film up women's skirts at Sainsbury's in Taplow . The secret camera was discovered when Cordell was stopped and searched on December 19 last year. Police later searched his house and found a USB stick which held 48 indecent images of children, Reading Crown Court heard. A second memory stick contained 639 . images and a laptop had a further 675, with an additional three videos. All were of children aged between 13 and 16. He admitted three counts of making indecent photographs of children and one count of committing an act outraging public decency. The court heard he was a family man of previous good character who was 'humiliated' at being exposed. 'Gross invasion': Female customers complained to staff about Cordell sidling up to them at the supermarket . Judge Zoe Smith said the supermarket victims were probably unaware they had been filmed. But she added: 'It was nevertheless a gross invasion into someone else’s privacy.' Cordell, from Maidenhead, Berks, was given a three-year community order and must attend a sexual offenders’ group programme. He was ordered to pay court costs of £500 and was placed on the sexual offenders' register for five years. A five-year sexual offences prevention order means 'risk management software' will be installed on his computer.","Timothy Cordell hid the camera inside a medicine tablet box and propped it up with a bottle of milk .

July 18 this year and failed a roadside breath test, recording 56mcg of . alcohol in her breath - 21 points over the legal limit. Mrs Ross, 52, who lives in Treskillard near Redruth, has no previous convictions and pleaded guilty to the offence at a hearing at Truro Magistrates’ Court on August 29. But despite three months elapsing since she was charged with the offence - and six weeks since her conviction - parents say the school have not kept them informed. One father slammed the college for keeping news of Mrs Ross’s conviction from parents. He said: 'The school has not sent . anything out to parents to deny or explain what everyone is saying. That’s more the issue for me. We should be informed.' Bad example: Karen Ross, head of Treviglas Academy School Newquay, pictured meeting Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, has been accused of failing to tell parents that she had been caught drink-driving . A student at the secondary school said Mrs Ross had been approached continually by pupils asking about her offence. She added: 'I think it’s quite bad . because she’s the head teacher and she should be setting an example. If . someone gets caught smoking then they get told off but she was caught . drinking and driving.' Guidelines by the Teaching Agency on . behalf of the Department for Education (DfE) suggest a drink-drive . conviction can amount to misconduct as it affects a teacher’s ability to . act as a role model and brings the profession into disrepute. A spokeswoman for the DfE said she was . not aware of Mrs Ross’s case and Cornwall Council has confirmed it is a . subject for the governors to discuss primarily, rather than the . authority. Critical: Parents and pupils at Treviglas College, Newquay, Cornwall, have said they should have been informed of ther headteacher's conviction for drink-driving . It has also been revealed that some school governors were not aware of the situation. It is understood the chair of governors felt Mrs Ross’s conviction was a 'personal matter' and would not affect her role as head teacher. Newquay police and national drink-drive charities have spoken out against drink-driving and have stressed the seriousness of the offence. Mrs Ross declined to comment. However, Patricia Hewitt, head of the council’s media relations team, said: 'The council is aware of the conviction of the head teacher.

Officers investigating the crime appealed for anyone who may have been offered elk meat over the past few days to come forward.

Appeal: Officers investigating the crime at Wooden Top Farm appealed for anyone who may have been offered elk meat over the past few days to come forward . Mr Ricahrds yesterday said he had managed to re-capture one of the two animals that had escaped.

Mr Richards, 56, said all the animals stood over 6ft tall and are worth up to £1,000 each. He said: 'I was very angry to find six were missing, but we got on top of the situation straight away. 'We managed to track one down. She's my favourite one out of all the elk. 'You can feed her by hand, but even with that we had to set up a way of containing her because they are huge.'

Asperger's sufferer Gary McKinnon will discover on Tuesday if his decade-long battle against extradition to the U.S. is over. Home Secretary Theresa May will tell MPs whether there are sufficient medical grounds to halt his removal on charges of hacking into computers at the Pentagon and Nasa. Medical experts have warned the 46-year-old will take his own life if placed on a plane to America. Decision time: Home Secretary Theresa May, left, will reveal if there are grounds to halt the extradition of Gary McKinnon, right . The decision will be based on a psychiatric report prepared for Mrs May by professors Declan Murphy and Thomas Fahy. Mr McKinnon’s legal team say the report confirms that there is a ‘significant’ risk of suicide which will increase if he is extradited. The report adds: ‘If he is transferred to a US prison without provision for his particular mental health... then this risk would very significantly increase.’ Mr McKinnon’s removal is being pursued under the Extradition Act, which critics say is biased in favour of the US and gives the Home Secretary little discretion over when an extradition can be halted on medical grounds. Mr McKinnon’s mother, Janis Sharp, has called on government figures to honour their promises to save her son. David Cameron, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Attorney General Dominic Grieve have all supported this paper’s Affront to British Justice campaign calling for Mr McKinnon to face trial in the UK. Fearing the future: Mr McKinnon's mother Janis, right, is calling for the extradition to be halted in medical grounds . A study, carried out by ex-Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell, has called for major changes to the UK/US extradition treaty. Crucially, Sir Menzies says it must be re-worded so British citizens are afforded the same legal protection as their US counterparts. The report, commissioned by Nick Clegg, directly contradicts the findings of the ‘whitewash’ Sir Scott Baker review into the extradition deal signed by Labour with the Bush administration in the aftermath of 9/11. Sir Scott’s study for the Home Office concluded that the Extradition Act was not biased, even though nine times as many Britons have been extradited as Americans. At the moment, ‘probable cause’ has to be shown before a UK request for extradition of an American citizen will be granted - with US citizens having the right to a court hearing to examine the evidence against them. But the US must show only that there is ‘reasonable suspicion’ that a person being demanded from Britain has committed an offence. The American authorities need only to outline the alleged offence, the punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of the suspect sought. Sir Menzies, who is a QC, says he ‘respectfully disagrees’ with the findings of the Baker review, which Home Secretary Theresa May is currently considering. He said: ‘To put the matter as simply as I can, one may have a ‘suspicion’ that someone has committed a crime, but that is a different and lower standard than being satisfied that it is ‘probable’ that a crime was committed by that person. ‘The proper course should be to raise the British standard to the American one, so that UK citizens do not suffer a disadvantage compared to their US equivalents.’",Medical experts fear the 46-year-old will take his own life if placed on a plane to America .

When you smile at your boss and he beams back, you might assume it means he is happy with your work. But don’t be fooled – he may just be taking pity on you. A study has found that those who feel powerful tend not to smile back at important people, saving their smiles instead for those below them in the pecking order. Sleazy grin: A study has found that those who feel powerful save their smiles for those below them in the pecking order . Researcher Evan Carr said: ‘Our . interpretation of this is that when you are feeling powerful and see a . low-status person, you are almost throwing them a bone, thinking “Oh, I . should smile at this person because I’m better than them”.’ It is well known that we tend to . mimic other people’s body language, but Mr Carr wanted to see how we . copy facial expressions and whether power and status are important. He asked 55 young men and women to . write about a time when they felt powerful – such as leaving home to go . to university – or powerless. They were then hooked up to equipment . that measures the activity of key facial muscles, and were asked to . watch short video clips of people with jobs with different levels of . prestige, who were smiling or frowning at them. As they watched, the equipment . measured the activity of the zygomaticus major – the ‘smiling muscle’ that raises the corner of the mouth. It also gave readouts for the corrugator supercilii, the ‘frowning muscle’ that furrows the brow and is frozen by Botox. The results showed that the . volunteers were more likely to scowl in response to a frown from a . doctor or someone in a position of power. These frowns were also more intense, the Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference in New Orleans heard. But it was the volunteers’ responses to smiling faces that were really telling. The ugly truth: Evan Carr's research suggests the less appealing reasons why your boss might be smiling at you . The men and women who felt powerful tended not to smile back at high-fliers. But they did return the smiles of those who were lower down the pecking order – and their smiles were bigger. Meanwhile, those who felt powerless smiled at everyone, regardless of their rank. The researchers think that people who . feel powerful try to exert their dominance by not appearing too friendly . to those who might be a threat. They have no such qualms about . appearing approachable to those who lack authority. Changes in the volunteers’ expressions were too small to be seen by the eye but Mr Carr, from the . University of California, says clearly visible smiles may follow the . same pattern. He said it is likely that the decision to suppress or return a smile occurs subconsciously.","Researcher Evan Carr found those who feel powerful tend not to smile back at important people .

The council admitted liability but the case went to trial after Ms Fari rejected their initial offer of a £7,500 settlement. Mother-of-13 Barbara Fari tried to sue Haringey Council in North London, pictured, after she trip on an uneven paving stone outside her house and injured her knee . But Judge Christopher Mitchell struck out her claim in its entirety at Central London county court last week after deciding that the mother-of-13 had grossly exaggerated her claims. Undercover surveillance had found that Ms Fari had a pre-existing deformity in her knee and that she had exaggerated the extent of her injuries sustained by the fall. Judge Mitchell said the injury would have resulted in two to three months of discomfort and was worth no more than £1,500. He said the claim had been a massive attempt to deceive the court and referred the matter to the High Court. Ms Fari, who is on Income Support and disability benefits, may now face prosecution for contempt of court and a prison sentence.

An equestrian 'expert' has been banned from keeping horses, after confining her own animals in such squalid conditions that three had to be put down . Lesley Skipper, 61, is a prolific author whose works include ‘Understanding the Arabian Horse’ and ‘Realise Your Horses’ True Potential’. But she and her husband Brian, 56, appeared in Darlington Magistrates’ Court charged with four counts of causing unnecessary suffering to their horses and two charges of failing to ensure the animals’ welfare. Neglect: Lesley Skipper, 61, has been banned from keeping horses after being found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to her animals . RSPCA inspector Garry Palmer visited the couple’s stables in Middleton St George, near Darlington, on June 14 2011 after The British Horse Society raised the alarm. He said: 'When I turned up on the day I thought offences had been committed as did the vet and our independent prosecutions department.' The investigation found that two of the horses at the stables were suffering from the foot disease laminitis, while another had severe dental problems. Suffering: A grey stallion had been so neglected it was put down immediately . Squalid: The accumulation of litter meant the horses' heads were nearly touching the ceilings of their stables . An accumulation of dirty litter meant the horses’ heads were almost touching the roof of their stables. A grey stallion, called ‘Nivalis’, had to be put down at the scene. Two other horses were signed over to the RSPCA - an Arab cross mare and a grey mare - and both were put down on veterinary advice. A fourth horse, an Arab cross stallion named Jaz, hasn’t been signed over by the couple but is currently in RSPCA care. It has had to undergo six months of treatment on its hooves. The Skippers pleaded not guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an adult female Arab cross by failing to seek professional veterinary attention for chronic laminitis, and to causing unnecessary suffering to a grey stallion by failing to seek professional veterinary attention for chronic laminitis. Prolific: Lesley Skipper has written a number of books on horses. Her latest, 'Understanding the Arabian Horse' was written during the period the RSPCA say the neglect took place - between 14 May and 14 June 2011. They were also charged with causing unnecessary suffering to an Arab cross stallion by failing to seek professional veterinary attention for overgrown hooves, and with causing unnecessary suffering to a grey mare by failing to seek appropriate veterinary care to address dental problems. The couple also pleaded not guilty to failing to meet the needs of the four horses by not ensuring their need for a suitable environment and failing to meet their needs by failing to protect them from pain, suffering, injury and disease. The Skippers, of Durham Road, Stockton-on-Tees, were found guilty of all the charges which took place between 14 May and 14 June 2011 following a four day trial. Survivor: An Arab cross stallion named Jaz (pictured), had to have treatment for overgrown hooves . Their solicitor, Ann Marie Gregory, argued that any ban on keeping animals should relate only to horses because there was no evidence that the couple had ever neglected their other animals. She said: 'These people are in their late fifties, early sixties and there is no suggestion that they have neglected any other animals. 'They have dogs and cats at home, I ask that they can keep the dogs and cats bearing in mind it is the first offence and bearing in mind the difficulties they have had.' Put to sleep: A grey mare called Roxzella (pictured) was put down because of dental problems . The court had previously heard that Mr Skipper suffers from bipolar and post-traumatic stress disorder and that the pair were suffering from flu when the bedding became too difficult to clear out by hand. Presiding magistrate Les Abbott banned them from keeping horses indefinitely and imposed a deprivation order in favour of the RSPCA, meaning that a fourth horse will stay under the charity’s care. The couple were also ordered to pay £250 each towards court costs. Pain: Bay Arab cross Imzadi (pictured) also had to be put down, so advanced was its chronic foot disease . Speaking after the sentence, RSPCA inspector Ruth Coxon said: 'We are really pleased with the sentencing, we strove for a ban, that is what we took them to court for and that is what we have got. 'The fact that it is an indefinite ban is really good news to protect animals from suffering in their hands in future.' RSPCA inspector Garry Palmer said: 'These are people who are supposed to know how to care for horses, so it is even more unacceptable that they left these animals in such poor conditions. 'By banning the defendants from keeping horses the court has recognised how important it is that no other animals are made to endure the same fate.'","Lesley Skipper, 61, is the author of several books on equine care .

A soft judge who repeatedly gave a career criminal a 'final chance' to change her ways was finally forced to put the mother-of-one behind bars - for her 106th offence. Sundee Spaulding, 25, had avoided jail despite having more than 33 convictions for more than 100 theft-related and dishonesty crimes. But she was finally given a 12-month prison term yesterday after Judge Carol Hagen, who had previously given her numerous 'final chances', said Spaulding had given her no other choice. Soft justice: Mother-of-one Sundee Spaulding, 25, left, was given numerous second chances by Bristol based Judge Carol Hagen, right, despite repeatedly re-offending . Behind bars: Spaulding was jailed for 12 months for theft and a further six months for breaking a previous community order at Bristol Crown Court . She told Spaulding: 'This is the end of the line for the time being. I hope the future is not without hope. 'I hope when you are released you will be clean of drugs and that you will make a fresh start, but you have to be proactive.' The notorious soft-justice judge gave drug-addicted Spaulding a 'final chance' in May and handed her a strict community order - despite the fact she had broken her supposed 'last chance' given after another conviction. Finally jailed: Mother-of-one Sundee Spaulding, 25, had previously avoided jail for her crimes despite having more than 33 convictions . But Bristol Crown Court was told that . she had failed to attend her rehabilitation appointments after only two . months when she became homeless and began taking drugs again. It was then that Spaulding entered a Lloyds Pharmacy, in Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, and stole cosmetic creams worth £420. She was later identified by CCTV and appeared before Bristol Magistrates' Court in October where she admitted the thefts. Robert Reid, prosecuting, said: 'This defendant is 25-years-old and has a history of 104 offences, excluding those that come before you today. 'She made full admissions to the thefts but said she did not enter the shop to shop-lift but saw an opportunity and took the creams.' After failing to turn up for sentencing a warrant was issued and Spaulding handed herself in. Neil . Treharne, defending the prolific thief, said Spaulding had begun to use . drugs again after she was evicted from her flat in July. He . added however that the creams had not been stolen to feed her drug . habit but instead she had intended to sell them to pay for rent. He said: 'She has looked pretty appalling in front of these courts on some occasions. 'She has cleaned herself up now though and is free of drugs. She has a little girl who is now seven and she is trying to revolve her life around seeing her.' Speaking directly from the dock Spaulding apologised to Judge Hagen and agreed that custody was the best option. She . said: 'I want to apologise because you did give me so many chances and I . did mess up. I think that custody is the best option for me now.' Judge . Hagen handed her a 12-month prison term, six months for the theft and a . further six months for breaking her previous community order. Judge Carol Hagen has previously been criticised for declining to send serious offenders to jail. Last year she refused to send prolific burglar Jason Reed to jail - before he went on to steal from 22 more homes. She then cut his jail term, after he was finally caged. In 2010 she failed to send carer Jane . Hoy to prison for stealing from one of her patients - despite describing . her offence as a 'gross breach of trust targeting a vulnerable victim'. Victim Lorraine Andrews said she had been left ""absolutely gobsmacked"" by the decision. She was criticised in 2010 after a man . who stabbed a neighbour over a text message to his girlfriend and a man . with 3,400 indecent images of children both avoided custody. In February this year, jewel thief Mikey . Rush, of Withywood, Bristol, was spared jail despite stealing . £20,000-worth of goods from 11 shops.","Sundee Spaulding, 25, jailed at Bristol Crown Court after racking up .

Scaling the world’s highest peaks or trekking through the rainforest are adventures many dream of for a lifetime. Navigating the murky waters of the Thames in a rowing boat? Perhaps not quite so much. Yet that trip has been ranked alongside the likes of climbing Everest and rafting the Amazon as one of the greatest experiences in the world. It joins a list, compiled by influential guidebook firm Lonely Planet, which also includes tracking mountain gorillas in Uganda and diving with sharks in South Africa.

Here, workers busy themselves at buzzing machinery and hurry between racks glinting with a vast array of jewelled colours. This is the Thomas Taylor Bowls factory in Glasgow, where the game begins. Brightly coloured balls are shaped, polished and rolled down ramps for testing before being used in play across the globe. Sweet shop: The shining bowls are shaped, polished and engraved before being shipped out across the world . Expert design: Rough edges are sanded off using a computer-controlled lathe and the balls are rolled down a ramp to test how they curve . Weapons of choice: The bowls come in a cast array of beautiful colours, including 'mulberry', 'raspberry ripple' and even 'flame' Big industry: The 200-year-old family firm is a superpower in the world of lawn green and crown green bowls . The fascinating pictures provide a rare insight into the workings of the 200-year-old family firm. The company is one of the biggest exporters in Scotland after the whisky industry and  the Bank of Scotland's second oldest customer and . It is a superpower in the world of lawn green and crown green bowls. More than 12.8million different . variations of bowls are produced in the small factory, which employs 52 . staff, most of whom have worked at the plant for decades. The factory, in Bernard Street, Bridgeton, was founded by the Taylor family in 1796, and bought by current owners the Herons in 1992. Since then, they have made it their mission to insert a bit of colour into an otherwise monotone bowling world. Although there are many black bowls . lying on racks, what draws the eye are rows and rows of pretty shades . from 'mulberry', 'raspberry ripple' to 'flame'. Anne Dunwoodie, a bowls star and manager at the company said: 'It is like walking into a candy sweet shop - like someone has opened a tube of Smarties and it exploded everywhere.' Managing director Grant Heron, 37, took over from his dad, Alex, 69, when he retired. Formerly a mechanical engineer, he takes a very hands-on approach to the business, and is able to use all the machinery. He said: 'We feel a great sense of history and a responsibility to keep as much industry in the UK as we can. 'We . don't want Britain to be a service country. I am proud of the . engineering history of Glasgow and I want it to continue that.' Bespoke products: Each bowl is hand-painted after being engraved with an emblem such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge or the English Rose . Made in Scotland: Each Taylor Ace bowl is carefully inspected for chips, cracks or defects and its bias is checked . Blue is the colour: A lathe crafts the distinctive shape of the ball . In . 1998, they began producing the famous coloured bowls - but came up . against opposition from their main importer, Australia, who banned the . use of them. But after the Scottish team playing Down Under refused to use any other bowls except their lucky blue ones, the ban was lifted and now green, pink, blue, orange and custom colour bowls are used worldwide. In 1999, the rules for Flat Green bowls were changed by the World Bowls Board, to allow for the inclusion of coloured bowls. The first stage in manufacturing is . 'compression moulding', where melamine - a hard plastic-like material - . arrives in powder form in brown bags. The melamine, which is also used in kitchen worktops, is weighed out and melted into a dough in an enormous oven. It . is then packed into moulds and heated to 130C until it turns into a . 'treacle-like' liquid, before being pressed under a 150-ton weight. Each . bowl is left to cool for 12 hours before the shaping stage, in which . any rough edges left from the mould are sanded off on a . computer-controlled lathe. A two-pronged sanding machine then puts indentations for the grips on to the bowls using diamonds. The bowl is then weighed and rolled down a ramp on to a slate bed 'Test Table' to check the bias. Rock and roll: More than 12.8million different variations of bowls are produced in the small factory . The bowls are then washed for 45 minutes in a massive vibrating vat with water, detergent and silicon pyramids. They are polished by 22-inch rotating mops in batches of 60, in a room covered in thick dust. Many of the machines in the factory have been purpose-built using parts from other machines. The polishing machine, bought in 1982, was previously used to polish Tefal pans in the 1960s. Finally, the balls are inspected for chips, cracks and defects and engraved with one of 4500 different emblems, such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge or the English Rose, and stamped with a 'Made in Scotland' signature. Each one is then painted by hand, inspected again and packed up for shipping and sale. A set of four of the coloured bowls sells for around £200, and can be shipped to any of 97 countries all over the world. Father-of-two Mr Heron, whose sister Vicky Goldie is sales director at Taylor Bowls, is very proud of the factory, the workers and the bowls they produce and always on the look out for new ideas. He said: 'In my opinion we make the best bowls in the world, but there is always room for improvement.'

Household name retail chains closed stores at a rate of 32 a day over the summer in a dramatic escalation of the crisis on the nation’s high streets. There were 953 more shop closures than openings among large chains in the first half of 2012, which compares to a net fall of 174 for the whole of 2011. The figures will raise the spectre of yet more urban centres becoming ‘ghost towns’ as shoppers cut spending during the recession and switch to shopping online. Ghost towns: Household name retail chains closed stores at a rate of 32 a day over the summer . While industry analysts predict hundreds more shops, both large chain and independent outlets, are set to put up the shutters. Specialist toy shops, fashion outlets, jewellers, furniture stores, greetings card and poster shops are all falling in numbers. Big chains like Clintons, Game, Peacocks and JJB have either disappeared completely or have lost hundreds of outlets. While town centres are seeing more pawnbrokers, bookmakers, charity shops, coffee shops and convenience stores run by the ‘big four’ supermarkets. Figures suggest the decision to hire 'Queen of Shops' Mary Portas, pictured, to devise a rescue plan have little chances of success . The figures suggest government pledges to tackle high street decline and the decision to hire ‘Queen of Shops’ Mary Portas to devise a rescue plan have little chances of success. Miss Portas has admitted that a number of high streets are beyond saving and town centres need to be switched to other uses such as housing, schools, gyms and community facilities. Even the major supermarkets, such as Tesco, have admitted that the rush to build vast new shopping barns is over against the background of the rise of internet shopping. Tesco has talked about trying to sell off some of its large Extra stores and rent out space in others. Insolvency expert Mike Jervis, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, who compiled the figures in partnership with the Local Data Company, said: ‘All retailers in distress have too many locations. The insolvencies of Game, Peacocks and Clintons demonstrated this in spades. ‘Relatively long leases, with . inflexible terms, have been entered into in a growth phase of the . economy which is no longer appropriate. ‘Where . over-expansion has already taken place, retailers need to face that . reality and formulate a strategic plan in partnership with landlords, . not in confrontation with them. ‘There are sophisticated tools to analyse the extent to which sales from closed stores migrate to a retailer’s other locations. Properly managed, a large part of the lost sales can be regained. ‘Retail is increasingly becoming a partnership between the store group, its suppliers and the owners of its locations. Like any partnership which falls on hard times, dialogue involving all partners is key.’ The figures suggest shoppers are cutting spending during the recession and switching to shopping online . Matthew Hopkinson, director of the Local Data Company, warned hundreds of more stores will close. He said: ‘This rapid increase in the drawdown of the multiple retailers in the first half of this year is not unexpected. ‘It also has some way to go as consumer spend remains low and the omni-channel environment requires fewer but larger and more ‘dynamic’ stores. ‘The departure of so many larger stores is a major issue for many town centres, especially in secondary centres, where they have for many years been their high street’s anchors. ‘A similar slowing in growth of the independents combined with this multiples drawdown has significant consequences beyond just driving vacancy rates up for many of these town centres.’ Tesco has talked about trying to sell off some of its large Extra stores and rent out space in others .

The acting commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard has warned that the country is prepared for 'global battles' if its nuclear sites are attacked. General Hossein Salami said Israel will 'definitely' face fierce retaliation if it attacks Iranian nuclear sites. His words, reported by the semiofficial ISNA news agency, seem to be part of Iran's efforts to portray any strike . as the trigger for a regional conflict. Tough times: General Hossein Salami spoke out in the face of punitive EU sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme . Inflammatory words: Gen Salami made his comments on the sidelines of combat drills by paramilitary fighters controlled by the Revolutionary Guard, known as Basiji, pictured . Willing to retaliate: Iran will respond to offensive action from Israel with force, warned he acting commander of the Revolutionary Guard . The implication is that such a clash could draw in Iranian . proxies, such as Lebanon's Hezbollah, on Israel's borders. He spoke on the sidelines of urban . combat drills in Tehran by 15,000 paramilitary fighters known as . Basiji, who are controlled by the Revolutionary Guard. The exercises were dubbed 'Ila Beit ol . Moqaddas,' or Toward the Holy City, meaning Jerusalem. The war games . include drills on defending against mock air raids and other threats. The European Union is currently imposing new sanctions against Iran in a bid to force the country to come clean about its nuclear programme. A meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday imposed restrictive measures intended to hit the country's treasury and increase pressure on its Islamic regime headed by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Defiance: A protest against the Iranian Revolutionary Guards last month in Lebanon, which Gen Hossein warned could be drawn in to any future clash with Israel . Meanwhile, a leading European satellite . provider took 19 Iranian television and radio broadcasters off the air, a . result of earlier sanctions which prompted accusations of censorship . and threats to sue from Iranian state television. European Union governments imposed . sanctions on Tuesday against major state companies in the oil . and gas industry and strengthened restrictions on the central bank, . cranking up financial pressure. More than 30 firms and institutions were listed in the EU's Official . Journal as targets for asset freezes in the EU, including the National . Iranian Oil Company, a large crude exporter, and the National . Iranian Tanker Company. Both are vital to the Iranian oil industry, the main source of revenue for the government, and are growing increasingly important in recent months as the EU and U.S. seek to reduce Tehran's access to cash by forcing Western companies to halt trade with Iran. Worry: Both German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, left, and Britain's William Hague spoke positively about the sanctions imposed on Iran at Monday's EU meeting in Luxembourg . Monday's meeting approved 'additional restrictive measures in the financial, . trade, energy and transport sectors' against Iran as well as imposing . asset freezes and trade restrictions on more companies. Iran is still refusing to cooperate . fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency regarding its nuclear . programme, something the Luxembourg meeting said was ‘acting in flagrant . violation of its international obligations.’ German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the ministers had also banned the import of Iranian natural gas into EU nations. The EU ministers also agreed to prohibit all transactions between EU and Iranian banks unless they were authorised in advance for humanitarian reasons. No transparency: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is still refusing to come clean about the country's nuclear programme insisting it is intended for peaceful purposes . Financial restrictions: The EU's foreign ministers hope that the new sanctions against Iranian trade and freezing of assets will hit the Islamic nation's treasury . They tightened restrictions on the Central Bank of Iran and imposed more export restrictions ‘notably for graphite, metals, software for industrial purposes, as well as measures related to the shipbuilding industry.’ Maryam Rajavi, president-elect of the Iranian Resistance, an organisation seeking to oust Ahmadinejad’s regime, welcomed the decision to expand sanctions. She called the move ‘an essential step to preclude this regime from acquiring nuclear weapons,’ and asked the EU to sever all economic and commercial ties with Iran. On his way into Monday's meeting, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said new sanctions would be ‘a sign of our resolve in the European Union that we will step up the pressure.’ Hague said such pressure would . continue to mount ‘over the coming months unless negotiations succeed. We remain open of course to success of negotiations.’ Many . countries fear that Iran is working to develop nuclear weapons but . Iranian officials say the nuclear programme is intended solely . for peaceful purposes. Suspected site: Lavizan Shiyan, a restricted area next to a military complex in a Tehran suburb, was thought to be a possible location for weapons of mass destruction . Possible base: An alleged facility in Natanaz, Iran which the regime also claims is completely harmless . The European broadcast satellite cutoff means state broadcaster Irib’s television channels are no longer shown in Europe and elsewhere. Satellite provider Eutelsat agreed with media services company Arqiva to block Irib's nine TV channels and ten radio stations as of Monday morning because of ‘reinforced EU council sanctions,’ Eutelsat spokeswoman Vanessa O'Connor said. Irib was targeted in a round of EU sanctions against Iran adopted in March after European officials said its broadcasts violated human rights. Iran's state-run Press TV said Irib could take legal action against Eutelsat over the cutoff ‘to compensate for any material and spiritual damages.’ Press TV says it was among the channels cut by the Eutelsat decision. Others include Farsi-language channels for Iranian expatriates and Arabic-language offerings, including the news channel Al-Alam. In a statement, Press TV said the move ‘shows that the European Union does not respect freedom of speech and is a step to mute all alternative news outlets representing the voice of the voiceless.’","General said Israel would face fierce retaliation if it attacks .

Busted: Germaine Gardea was charged with bigamy after his second wife found he had been married to another woman . Hell may hath no fury like a woman scorned, but what about two of them? Germaine Gardea, 38, was arrested and charged with bigamy a week ago after his second wife discovered he had been married to another woman without her knowledge. Gardea has reportedly lived with both wives in two separate Texas towns since 2009 - with neither of the women knowing of the other’s existence. The second wife, Leslie Gardea, was also unaware that her husband was married because he showed her documentation that he and the first wife divorced on October 16, 2009 - the same day they were married. Gardea had filed for divorce, but the case was dropped because he did not show up at a court hearing, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. He was reportedly found out after Leslie Gardea discovered that her husband had been writing checks to another woman.

Fort Worth police spokesman Sgt Pedro Criado told the Star-Telegram: 'The first wife knew nothing of the second wife until she made contact with her.' He added: '[Gardea] has a job in which he travels extensively so I suppose the extended time away from either wife was easily explained until the bills were located.' It was the first wife who reported Gardea’s alleged misdeeds to the police.

He was booked on October 11 on a charge of bigamy and later released from jail after posting $2,000 bond. Germaine and Leslie Gardea own a flight training school together called Aviator Air Centers located near the Grand Prairie Municipal Airport. The Star-Telegram reported that that the first wife claims that she did not know of any divorce document and contends that Mr Gardea may have forged her signature. Germaine and Leslie Gardea did not return calls by the Star-Telegram for comment. Robert Hoover, the divorce attorney for the first wife, told the paper that his client would not be speaking about the case.","Germaine Gardea, 38, charged with bigamy after his two wives find out about each other .

The New York Times company said it will proceed with its plan for Mark Thompson to take over as CEO today despite an intensifying scandal at the BBC which raised questions about his tenure at Britain's flagship broadcasting company. The firm's leading paper, The New York Times, has maintained its confidence in the new chief following news that Mr Thompson's successor, George Entwistle, the director-general of the BBC, had resigned on Saturday. Entwistle took the blame for a news program on the BBC's Newsnight programme, which aired a mistaken allegation that a former British senior politician sexually abused a child at a care home. Mark Thompson, newly named CEO of The New York Times, arrives at the paper's offices today in New York . MarkThomson, former BBC director general, is facing questions over the BBC's Newsnight programme shelving of an investigation into child sexual-abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile . Full backing: The New York Times says it retains confidence in Mr Thompson despite the intensifying scandal at the BBC . The latest embarrassment comes as the BBC faces police and other investigations into claims that hundreds of people, some as young as 12, were sexually abused over the course of decades by one of their top personalities, the late Jimmy Savile. It is also facing awkward questions over how the same Newsnight program - while Thompson was director-general - killed a report that was investigating complaints against the presenter and instead aired laudatory shows commemorating Savile after he died last year. Mr Thompson said he did not know about the nature of the investigation by Newsnight into Savile, and had no involvement in the decision to axe the report. He later said he had a 'chance meeting' with a journalist who mentioned the Newsnight investigation into Savile, but said he had not been told any of the details or the scale of the problem. Entwistle's departure and his acceptance of responsibility for editorial decisions as director-general, adds pressure to any evaluation of Thompson's role at the BBC and whether he was ultimately accountable for the shelving of the Savile report. But a New York Times spokesman said yesterday: 'He is going to be CEO beginning November 12.' Prolific paedophile: Late presenter Jimmy Savile is believed to have abused hundreds of women and children over his long career at the BBC . In the firing line: Newsnight, presented by Jeremy Paxman (above), was due to air claims that Savile had sexually abused women, but then shelved the programme . Thompson did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Entwistle's resignation. Earlier, he declined to be interviewed about his plans for the New York Times. Entwistle stood down after it emerged that Newsnight had aired allegations by a child abuse victim which led to former Conservative Party treasurer Lord McAlpine being wrongly identified as a paedophile. Lord McAlpine had always denied any involvement and says he will now sue those who made the false allegations. Following Entwistle's departure, two more senior BBC staff today 'stepped aside' as the crisis at the corporation deepens.

Meanwhile BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten was fighting for his job today as it emerged he had known of Newsnight’s disastrous plan to link a senior Tory to child abuse before the show aired. Savile, who died last year at the age of 84, is now believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific sex abusers, with hundreds of possible victims. The Metropolitan Police is leading a national investigation into the Jim'll Fix It Star's activities and pursuing hundreds of lines of inquiry. Former pop star Gary Glitter, 68, comedian Freddie Starr, 69, and a BBC producer have so far been arrested. They all deny the allegations.","Mr Thompson was head of British broadcaster when expose into Jimmy Savile abuse was shelved .

If you think pop music ain’t what it used to be, you may well be right. Research shows that today’s songs are slower and sadder than those of the past. And if this dreariness wasn’t depressing enough, they also last longer. The researchers, who analysed more than 1,000 hits from 1965 to 2009, blame the loss of the feel-good factor on modern acts wanting to be seen as serious and complex - and on listeners who like to think they are more sophisticated. Researchers say that modern pop music is sadder than slower than when the Beatles and Abba ruled the charts - but they admit Lady Gaga is the excetion. As a result, unambiguously uplifting songs like the Beatles’ Help! or She Loves You are few and far between. The researchers, from Canadian and German universities, analysed tempo and key of many of the biggest hits of the last 60 years. In general, a fast tempo and major key makes for a happy song, while a slow beat and minor key denotes misery. The analysis found the proportion of songs recorded in the minor key to have doubled, allowing sadder tones to predominate. Modern pop songs also tend to be slower, with just 100 beats per minute, compared with the 116 of the 1960s, and the average duration of a recording has increased from just under three minutes to almost four minutes. The study, from the University of Toronto and Free University of Berlin, also found mismatch of a minor key with a fast beat to have become more common. This, said the researchers could be an attempt to appeal to an audience that thinks it is more sophisticated than those of the past. They said that this change in tastes has left up-beat hits of the past such as Abba’s Waterloo sounding ‘naïve and slightly juvenile to contemporary ears’. Swedish supergroup Abba were also named as one of the great purveyors of the best pop. And modern, up-beat tunes recorded in the major key, such as Aqua’s Barbie Girl are often dismissed as being gimmicks. However, there is at least one best-selling singer who has managed to buck the trend, by recording fast-paced songs in a major key or mode to critical and popular acclaim. Writing in the journal Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity and the Arts, the researchers said: ‘Lady Gaga has somehow managed to transcend this association. ‘Her fast-tempo, major mode recordings such as Born This Way and Edge of Glory sound fresh while recalling or quoting popular music from an earlier time.’ The findings chime with research released earlier this year which concluded that today’s pop music is louder and blander than the hits of the 1950s and 1960s. The computer analysis of almost half a million pop, rock and hip hop songs from 1955 to 2010, revealed today’s tracks to be louder, which researchers said is because sound engineers and producers are cranking up the volume at the recording stage. The researchers singled out Lady Gaga as one of the few modern artists who can match classic pop. As a result, if two tracks are turned up to the same volume level on a CD player home, the more recent will sound louder. Apparently this is not due to better recording equipment, but is an attempt to make music that catches attention and is suitable for playing in noisy venues. The Spanish study also found evidence that the chords used and the changes between them are simpler, leading to the production of music that is easy on the ear but contains little variety. Researcher Martin Haro, of Barcelona’s Pompeu Fabra University, said: ‘I think this is related to the role of music. ‘In the 1950s and 60s, music was more artistic and for getting messages across. ‘Now it’s about dancing and relaxing ... with groups not so interested in experimenting.’","Researchers say modern music has lost the 'feelgood factor'

Apple fans will be thrilled to know that manufacturers in China have already begun producing the smaller sister of the iPad just in time for the device's November release. Dubbed by the industry as the 'iPad Mini'. manufacturers say the company has put in an order for 10 million of the tablets, showing the company's strong faith in their newest product. Insiders say the iPad Mini will be announced on October 17, a few days from the Amazon's Kindle Fire and Microsoft's Surface tablets releases, and go on sale November 2. Scroll down for video . Almost ready for prime time? Website Apple.Pro revealed these images of the alleged eight-inch iPad Mini, due to launch on October 17 . Apple, however, has not confirmed any of the reports or rumors about a smaller iPad, CBS reports. Apple's 9-inch device dominates the market, but smaller, cheaper tablets have been eating away at the iPad's popularity. The Mini launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per . cent - own a tablet, with another three per cent regularly borrowing . someone else's tablet for web browsing. About 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year. The U.S. survey by the Pew Research Center also suggests the flood of . cheaper tablets, such as the Google Nexus or Amazon Fire, are weakening . Apple's grip on the market. A year ago, Apple had more than 80 per cent of the market, but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent. The Kindle Fire has 21 per cent of the market, meanwhile Samsung's Galaxy tablet has eight per cent. Out of those surveyed, 44 per cent of adults who said they have a . smartphone, 46 per cent have an Android phone, 38 per cent, have an . iPhone and 10 per cent have a Blackberry. Apple's iPad mini is expected to so on sale around the world on November 2nd, according to online speculation. The launch date was reported by Fortune magazine, which cites Apple investors hearing the date from 'multiple sources'. The . device is believed to have similar hardware to last year's iPad 2, but . reduced to a pocket-friendly seven or eight-inch form. Fortune reports that Apple will send . out invites for the launch on October 10, gathering tech journalists and . stakeholders together to unveil the device. Amazon, meanwhile has already enjoyed huge success in the US with its updated Fire tablets - but will release them internationally for the first time on the 25th October. The gadgets, are available in both 7-inch and 8.9-inch versions (although only the 7-inch version is currently set to go o sale outside of the US). The third contender is Microsoft, with its Surface tablets. The firm will launch the Surface tablet at the same time as Windows 8, the latest version of its desktop operating system, which experts say is a 'make or break' time for the firm. 'It's a dangerous game, as all three firms are trying to steal each other's thunder,' said Tom Wiggins of gadget magazine Stuff. 'Apple tend to be more cagey. 'If I was Apple, and knew that Microsoft . was launching, I'd probably try and come up with something to take the . focus away from them - and nobody else can do that in quite the same way . Apple can.' Wiggins believes that Microsoft has so far played its cards close to its chest with the Surface tablet.The firm has not even confirmed a price for the gadget. 'Microsoft is the most interesting - it's a make or break thing for them, as they have always struggled with touchscreen interfaces. 'It has the potential to be a success - but the worry is that it will be overcomplicated compared to the iPad.' However, it is Apple's iPad mini that is expected to attract most attention. 'The iPad mini is potentially huge,' said Wiggins. 'But a lot will depend on price. There are a lot of people who would like an iPad but can't afford one, so if it does launch and is £250, it will be very difficult for anyone to beat.' Experts also believe that Amazon's Kindle, which is being launched outside the US for the first time, could be let down if not enough content is available. The gadget uses Amazon's own app and film and book stores. Steve Jobs famously ruled on a smaller iPad, saying 'The current crop of 7-inch tablets are going to be DOA, dead on arrival. 'We don't think you can make a great tablet with a 7-inch screen.' However, devices like the Amazon Kindle and Google's Nexus 7 have shown that there is a market for smaller devices that consumers can use on public transport, causing Apple to reportedly change its mind on an 'iPad mini' with a 7 or 8 inch screen. The firm has reportedly placed orders for ten million of the devices, which are also likely to feature the firms controversial new connector. 'Kindle Fire is a difficult one, especially in the UK,' said Wiggins. 'It is dependent on its content delivery, and they will have to have a lot of UK content at launch for it to work - but Kindle is a very strong brand now.. However, Wiggins also believes that the technique could also backfire - by confusing consumers. 'It is quite possible consumers will get confused,' he said. 'After the iPhone launched, a lot of competitors came out, and people did get confused. The iPad will continue to be the benchmark, the danger for Microsoft and Amazon is that people will ask 'can it do what an iPad does?' Most secrecy has surround the iPad Mini, a shrunken version . of Apple's market-changing tablet, is expected to launch on October 17, . with the device available in shops on November 2. If Apple follows previous form, the event will be held in San Francisco, with a simultaneous launch on London. Images purporting to show the iPad . Mini suggest a device measuring 7.85inches, with an aluminium back-cover . similar to the most recent iPad. It is likely to sport a rear-facing . camera and come with Apple's newest 'lightning' connector, a . controversial re-design which made previous accessories and chargers . obsolete without an adapter. If Apple follows its usual design . styles, it is likely to come in white and black versions, with a choice . of WiFi only, or a 3G option. However this unconfirmed. The device, while still likely to garner a premium price-tag, will help Apple compete with the burgeoning smaller tablet market. The 7-inch Google Nexus tablet sells for £159 for the cheapest version, while Amazon is also producing a budget tablet range. Steve Jobs was . unconvinced that a smaller tablet would be a success, seeing it as a . poor compromise between a tablet and a phone. However Apple appears to have had a change of heart, particularly now that the tablet market has now matured. One issue Apple might face by launching a Mini is a fragmentation in its core product lines. Until the release of the iPhone 5, . Apple's two product lines had kept the same screen resolution, meaning . apps did not need redesigning for different devices, a problem that plagues the competing Android platform. But with the increased screen size of . the iPhone 5, some apps now have a black border, at least until the . developers update their apps, and this problem may now afflict Apple's . tablets, depending on the final size of the Mini.","Unprecedented timing will see three launches this month .

David Blunkett: The veteran Labour MP has warned against statutory regulation of the press . David Blunkett today becomes the most senior Labour figure yet to come out against statutory regulation of the Press. Just days before the Leveson Inquiry is due to report, the former Home Secretary said there was no need to rush into legislation to ensure scandals such as phone hacking at the News of the World do not happen again. He said that despite the fact he had ‘suffered’ at the hands of the media, he did not want to see anything that would ‘change the terms on which we have a free Press’. The support for Press freedom from the former MP for Sheffield Brightside comes despite the fact that he resigned twice from Tony Blair’s cabinet following controversies in the media. In 2004, he resigned as Home Secretary after he was accused of intervening to speed up the visa application of his former lover’s nanny. An inquiry later found no evidence Mr Blunkett had personally fast-tracked the application. A year later, he stepped down as Work and Pensions Secretary. He was accused of failing to register shares he owned in a company bidding for contracts from his department – but was later found not to have breached the Ministerial Code. Mr Blunkett said he hoped newspapers would see the necessity of a strengthening of the existing Press Complaints Commission to ensure it has more ‘teeth’. If this happens, no laws would be needed, he said. His uneasiness at the prospect of statutory regulation of the Press contrasts with his leader Ed Miliband, who has said that whatever Lord Justice Leveson recommends should be implemented. The long-awaited report, out next Thursday, is expected to call for some form of statutory regulation. A range of senior Conservatives, including Education Secretary Michael Gove and London Mayor Boris Johnson, have spoken out against this. Mr Blunkett made his comments on Radio 4’s The Week at Westminster programme, to be broadcast today at 11am. He was asked by host Fraser Nelson why he is not ‘one of those who want the Government to act now’. The former minister said he would prefer to see the Press Complaints Commission strengthened, rather than giving the state a role. ‘I think we all want a complete transformation of what currently is the PCC so that it actually does have teeth so it can provide redress,’ he said. ‘I would like it not just to mediate, but to be able to make a judgment where the particular publication won’t play ball. I think we’ve got a long way to go on the back of next week’s announcement in persuading the media, the print media, to go along with something much tougher than is on the table. ‘And if we get that, we don’t need statutory underpinning or requirements. And if we don’t, we’re in a different ball game.’ 'Uneasiness': Lord Justice Leveson is expected to call for a new Press regulator backed by the law when his inquiry delivers its report next Thursday . Mr Blunkett said it was not a question of just being in favour of statutory regulation of the Press, or against. ‘I don’t think we should be in two camps,’ he said. ‘If you’re not in favour of statutory regulation, you’re somehow [seen as] a patsy of the media. ‘Well, I’m neither. I’ve suffered myself but that doesn’t mean retrospectively going over history I should want to change the terms on which we have a free Press.’ Asked whether statutory regulation of the Press would risk undermining democracy, Mr Blunkett replied: ‘We’ve got to use all the powers at our disposal not look immediately at legislation to do it.’ 'Dictator': Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe . Statutory regulation of Britain’s Press would be ‘manna from heaven’ for Robert Mugabe and all the world’s ‘tinpot dictators’, a Zimbabwean newspaper chief warned yesterday. Jethro Goko, editor-in-chief of Zimbabwe’s biggest independent newspaper, said it would be ‘a very sad day indeed’ if Lord Justice Leveson recommended statutory underpinning of a new Press watchdog. Mr Goko issued his warning in a letter to the Free Speech Network pressure group. His newspaper, the Daily News, was shut down by Mugabe for seven years and still has to operate under a state licence. He said: ‘With regards to the Leveson Inquiry, it would be a very sad day indeed – not just for the UK, but also for the Commonwealth press, if not global media generally – if this were to lead to statutory regulation of the fourth estate. ‘Many of the publishers and editors on the African continent that I’ve discussed this unimaginable possibility with, worry that if the UK does ill-advisedly take this route, it will be like manna from heaven for all the dictatorial regimes of the world. And we have a fair share of these tinpot dictators in Africa. ‘Indeed, I can only imagine the unrestrained joy that some people around President Robert Mugabe would derive from such a backward step in the UK. If gold rusts, what about iron?’ The Daily News is one of only two privately-owned newspapers in Zimbabwe. Stories critical of Mugabe have resulted in intimidation of journalists and it was only after he was forced to form a unity government in 2009 that independent newspapers were allowed to begin publication again.","David Blunkett said there was no need to rush into legislation to ensure there is no repeat of the phone hacking scandal .

Speaking at the scene yesterday, he said: ‘We are looking for toys from Ben, anything which could indicate where he had been. ‘He was a 21-month-old child. He would have had toys with him. The family say he was definitely playing with toys, a Dinky toy car, that sort of thing. 'We are looking for anything which may support that and give us an indication of where he might be. ‘A magnetometer basically identifies and locates ferrous metals. It is like a very powerful metal detector. ‘We are interested in anything which might identify the movements of Ben, any item of clothing, any toys, anything Ben may have been playing with. 'We are looking for belt buckles, buttons on trousers or a shirt. ‘Anything that might give us an indication of where Ben was when he was here and how far into the field he ventured, to give us some clarity on Ben’s movements immediately prior to his disappearance.’ Specialist sniffer dogs brought over from Britain were also deployed over the weekend, but failed to detect a scent. Helping in the hunt: Eddie Needham (centre), grandfather of Ben, is flanked by British police officers during a search operation for Ben's remains .

On the hunt: Specialist sniffer dogs brought over from Britain were also deployed over the weekend, but failed to detect a scent . A forensic archaeologist is also at hand to help identify if any bones discovered during the search are human. Yesterday, DS Fenwick praised the Needham family for their assistance in the case, as he revealed that diggers would begin work on the site today. He said: ‘One thing we have done is regressive interviews with all the Needham family. We spent a whole week interviewing the family about the land and all the circumstances at the time. He added: ‘We are going to get the digger out tomorrow. The JCB will be there. It is the next stage of the process. We will be removing some ground.’","Police are getting ready to use JCB diggers to move ground near to where missing boy Ben Needham was last seen in 1991 .

Two brothers from central New York who claimed a $5million lottery ticket sold at their family's store have been accused of scamming the winning ticket from a customer. Andy Ashkar, 34, and 36-year-old Nayel Ashkar have been charged with attempted grand larceny and conspiracy, authorities said Wednesday. Andy Ashkar also was charged with criminal possession of stolen property. Their lawyer says the brothers will plead not guilty. They maintain they legitimately received the ticket.

Andy Ashkar claimed in March that he bought the ticket at his parents' convenience store in Syracuse. But lawyers said the legitimate purchaser was fooled into giving up the winning scratch-off ticket when he went to cash it at the market in October 2006. A lottery winner waited six years to claim his  $5million prize to ensure his fiancee married him for love and not his money. Andy Ashkar, 34, of Camillus, came forward on March 1, just 11 days before the '$500,000,000 Extravaganza' scratch-off card would have . expired, New York Lottery initially said.

Andy . Ashkar also told lottery officials that he also didn't want the . windfall to influence his engagement and subsequent marriage. Calls to phone numbers listed for the Ashkar brothers went unanswered Wednesday morning. The . brothers' mother, Wasa Ashkar, said her husband, Neyef, sold the . winning ticket to Andy at the couple's Green Ale Market, but she . couldn't remember exactly when. In . an interview last month with MailOnline last month, Mrs Ashkar said that they are . now known as 'the good luck' store because of her son's big win. She . said that while they have never had a similar multi-million dollar win, . there have been a number of smaller victories in their shop. A few . years ago, a woman won $700,000 in a similar scratch-off game. She said she and her husband were . Palestinians from Jerusalem who immigrated to the United States nearly . 40 years ago and have owned the store for 12 years.

As any bleary-eyed plane passenger will confirm, a crying baby is almost impossible to ignore, no matter how hard you try. Now scientists believe they may have worked out why. An infant’s wails pull at the heartstrings in a way that other cries don’t, researchers found. Researchers found that the sound of a baby crying can trigger unique emotional responses in the brain, making it impossible for us to ignore them - whether we are parents or not. Just milliseconds after registering . the cry, the brain’s emotion centres are hard at work. It had been . thought that the brain was incapable of processing complex facets of . sound in such a short time. Other types of cry, including calls . of animals in distress, fail to elicit the same response – suggesting . the brain is programmed to respond specifically to a baby’s cry. A team of Oxford University scientists scanned the brains of 28 men and women as they listened to a variety of calls and cries. After 100 milliseconds – roughly the time it takes to blink – two regions of the brain that respond to emotion lit up. Their response to a baby’s cry was . particularly strong, the Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference in . New Orleans heard. The response was seen in both men and women – even . if they had no children. When we hear a baby cry, after 100 milliseconds, roughly the time taken to blink, two regions of the brain that respond to emotion light up. The response occurs in both men and women - and in people who have no children of their own. Experts say the response 'make sense' from an evolutionary perspective. Researcher Dr Christine Parsons said: . ‘You might read that men should barely notice a baby and step over it . and not see any of them but it’s not true. ‘There is a specialised processing in . men and women which makes sense from an evolutionary perspective that . both genders would be responding to these cues. ‘The study was in people who were not . parents, have no particular experience of looking after babies and yet . they are all responding at 100ms to these particular sounds, so this . might be a fundamental response present in all of us regardless of . parental status.’ Fellow researcher Katie Young said it . may take a bit longer for someone to recognise their own child’s cries . because they need to do more ‘fine-grained analysis’. The team had previously found that our reactions speed up when we hear a baby crying. Adults performed better on an arcade . game requiring speed, accuracy and dexterity when they were played the . sound of a baby crying than after they heard recordings of adults crying . or high-pitched birdsong. The findings could help shed light on . post-natal depression – where mothers struggle to bond with their . newborn – by showing how a healthy brain responds to a baby’s cries. The researchers found the sound of a crying baby was triggered within 100 milliseconds of hearing it .","Researchers find the cry of a baby triggers emotional responses in the brain unlike any other sound - even in non-parents .

Researcher have identified the furthest ever galaxy discovered in space - a staggering 13.3 billion light-years from Earth. The galaxy was observed around 420 million years after the Big Bang when the universe was just 3 per cent of its current age. Astronomers have calculated the galaxy is a 13.3 billion light-years from Earth with a single light-year representing 5,878,625 million miles. Scroll down for video . The newly discovered galaxy, named MACS0647-JD, is very young and only a tiny fraction of the size of our Milky Way. The object was observed 420 million years after the big bang . The object is so small it may be in the first stages of galaxy formation, with analysis showing the galaxy is less than 600 light-years across. For comparison the Milky Way is 150 000 light-years across. The estimated mass of this baby galaxy is roughly equal to 100 million or a billion suns, or 0.1 - 1 percent the mass of our Milky Way’s stars. It was spotted using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Space Telescope, and one of nature’s own natural 'zoom lenses' in space. Scientists say the object is in the first stages of galaxy formation with analysis showing it is less than 600 light-years across. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is 150,000 light-years across with the Solar System a third of the age of the newly discovered galaxy. Dan Coe, from the Space Telescope Science Institute, said. 'This object may be one of many building blocks of a galaxy. 'Over the next 13 billion years, it may have dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of merging events with other galaxies and galaxy fragments.' Galaxy Cluster MACS J0647, where the latest galaxy was spotted . Coe and his collaborators spent months ruling out alternative explanations for the object’s identity - such as red stars, brown dwarfs, and red galaxies - to conclude it was a very distant galaxy. The object, named MACS0647-JD, is the latest discovery from a programme which uses natural zoom lenses to reveal distant galaxies in the early universe. The Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) is using massive galaxy clusters as cosmic telescopes to magnify distant galaxies behind them, an effect called gravitational lensing. Rychard Bouwens, from Leiden University, Holland, said: 'While one occasionally expects to find an extremely distant galaxy using the tremendous power of gravitational lensing, this latest discovery has outstripped even my expectations of what would be possible with the CLASH program.“The science output in this regard has been incredible.'","Galaxy was observed 420 million years after the Big Bang .

Happy World Menopause Day! There won't be a parade and there isn't a fun dress code but the World Health Organisation has designated October 18th as World Menopause Day in a bid to inform more women about menopause and its impact. Our ageing population means that more women than ever are entering menopause and suffering the effects, often in silence because of embarrassment or a lack of information.. 62-year-old Kathryn Colas suffered from Vaginal Atrophy in silence for years and said it almost destroyed her marriage . One of the most common and debilitating side effects of menopause is Vaginal . Atrophy (VA) - also known as vaginal dryness. A survey commissioned by . the British Menopause Society has revealed that 45% of women who have . reached the menopause have suffered from VA and 70% of those women say that their sex life has suffered drastically as a result. VA can have disastrous consequences for sex lives, relationships . and marriages as well as the physical and mental health of women and although treatment is easy diagnosis remains tricky because it is such a taboo subject for many doctors and their patients. Today on This Morning 62-year-old Kathryn Colas appeared on the sofa with the show's resident doctor Dr. Chris Steele to talk about the impact VA had on her life, and try and help raise awareness. She said: 'It started in my 40s when using tampons became painful. 'Gradually sex was very painful, it was like a carpet burn. 'I was always too embarrassed to talk to my husband and he started to say it was like sleeping with a stranger. He felt very isolated and we started rowing about it. 'I was too embarrassed to go to the doctor too. 'I did my own research and found out that what I was feeling had a name, it was Vaginal Atrophy, I thought ""that is me""!'It is life changing, going from being a . jibbering idiot thinking there is something very wrong with me to finding out . that this is just a symptom of the menopause. 'And the remedy is so very simple. It is magic. It is transforming. 'My husband used to say ""I just want my wife back,"" I used to say ""I just want my life back!"".' The graphic by Novo Nordisk shows how Vaginal Atrophy affects both men and women, it was created as a result of a survey of 4000 women of menopausal age . WHAT IS VAGINAL ATROPHY . Before . the menopause the skin and tissues around the vagina are kept supple . and moist by fluids and mucus. These are made by glands at the neck of . the womb. Oestrogen (the female hormone) affects these glands. Oestrogen . also affects the tissues in and around the vagina, causing the lining . of the vagina to be thicker and more elastic. Oestrogen also stimulates . the cells that line the vagina to produce glycogen, a compound which . encourages the presence of helpful bacteria which protect the vagina . from infection.After the menopause the ovaries make less . oestrogen. The lack of oestrogen leads to thinning of the tissues around . the vagina and a reduction in the number of glands that make mucus. You . also lose some fat tissue from around the genital area. This may make . the area also look slightly different than before the menopause.In . summary, the hormonal changes make the vagina shorter, less elastic and . drier. The genital skin also looks paler. These changes usually take . months or years to develop after the menopause and vary from woman to . woman. Atrophic vaginitis is the medical term for the condition when . these changes produce troublesome symptoms. - - - - - - - - . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - . - - - - - - - - - .

HOW TO TREAT IT . Not . all women have all of the above symptoms. Treatment may depend on which . symptoms are the most troublesome. Because the problem is mainly due to . a lack of oestrogen, it can be helped by replacing the oestrogen in the . tissues. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)This . means taking oestrogen in the form of a tablet, gel, implant or . patches. This may be the best treatment for relieving the symptoms, but . some women don't like the idea of taking HRT. There are advantages and . disadvantages of using HRT. See separate leaflet called 'Menopause and . HRT' for more detail. Oestrogen creamsSometimes . a cream, pessary or vaginal ring containing oestrogen is prescribed. This restores oestrogen to the vagina and surrounding tissues without . giving oestrogen to the whole body. Usually the treatment is used every . day for about two weeks, and then twice a week for a further three . months. After this the effect of the treatment may be assessed by your . doctor. This treatment usually works well but the symptoms may recur . some time after stopping the treatment. Repeated courses of treatment . are often necessary. It is important to follow the instructions about . the amount of cream to use. Lubricating gelsIf . vaginal dryness is the only problem, or hormone creams are not . recommended because of other medical problems, lubricating gels may . help. There are two gels which are available in the UK that are . specifically designed to help the problem of vaginal dryness. They . replace moisture. They are Replens® and Sylk®. You can buy these from . the pharmacy and your pharmacist should be able to advise you.","45% of older women have suffered from Vaginal Atrophy .

The Brooklyn-based photographer who skyrocketed to fame after his well-timed picture of a couple getting in one last kiss before he was hauled off to court may not be getting the credit he deserves. Self-trained street photographer Mo Gelber, who snapped lovebirds Alexis Creque and Russell Murphy outside Manhattan Criminal Court last month, wants to enter his spectacular photograph in a prestigious competition, but there’s one problem. Neither Ms Creque nor Mr Murphy wish to give their consent, but Canon’s ‘Project Imagina10n’ required it. They found love in a hopeless place: Alexis Creque, 28, leans in to kiss her boyfriend, Russell Murphy, in this perfectly . timed snapshot after they were arrested . Race against the clock: Street photographer Mo Gelber's photo was disqualified after he didn't get the required consent forms . Mr Gelber told MailOnline today that he only had until 5pm tonight to obtain the love-struck . couple’s consent, but now since the time has passed, his photograph is out of the running. 'I have not heard back from Alexis, and she turned off her Facebook page. Maybe she got spooked,' he said over the phone earlier today. The young . woman told him that her boyfriend is expected to get out of jail . sometime Saturday, and had told Mr Gelber earlier that she would be willing to help only after her boyfriend was released. Adding to that was a disparaging note . slid to Mr Gelber from under the door of her apartment. According to the New York Post, he note read: . ‘F*** Off.' He told MailOnline after the 5pm deadline: 'Because of some legal issues, one of the four parties was not comfortable with some of the terms in the release.' But he is far from bitter. ‘I don’t have any hard feelings toward anybody,' he said. 'The fact that a judge in the competition views my photo a candidate for the finals means a lot to me. Being considered a finalist, I already consider myself a winner.’ Mr Gelber is doing all he can to . ensure the couple receives due credit, and has promised to share any . money he makes from the now viral ‘Last Kiss’ photo with them. He then . quipped: ‘I’ll just tell him don’t use (the money) to buy spray paint.’ Canon’s rules clearly state that if the photo depicts or . identifies any person other than the photographer, their written consent . must be obtained, which of course means he must obtain consent from the . two NYPD officers in the frame. One of the police officers has signed a release, but the other, as fate would have it, is on vacation. Even though the deadline passes without the forms of consent submitted to Canon, Mr Gelber said his mission has been accomplished. 'My ultimate goal of entering the contest was to get recognition as a photojournalist,' he said, noting that the image of the two kissing has spread like wildfire across the internet. 'I’ll go with the flow,' he said, adding: 'I’m mostly being realistic, so it’s fine either way. If I put all my cards, I might be setting myself up for disappoint.' Who's that girl? Alexis Creque, pictured, . contacted the photographer to reveal she was the woman in the picture. She said she was arrested in Manhattan on August 16 while watching her boyfriend allegedly spraying graffiti outside an exclusive bar . The story of how Mr Gelber, 42, identified the couple is one of fascination. Ms Creque contacted Mr Gelber through . Facebook to admit she was the blonde-haired woman kissing her . handcuffed beau, identified in a police report as 26-year-old Russell . Murphy, as they were hauled to Manhattan Criminal Court last month. Mr Gelber, who specialises in street . photography, snapped the well-timed smooch as he was walking past the . court. Rules of the road: Canon's Project Imaginat10n requires subjects' consent before the photo is entered . 'One of my specialties,' he told MailOnline, 'is candid street photos that capture the rolling emotions of people. Part of it is predicting what people do and anticipating it.' He happened to be there in hopes of snapping a picture of the . accused Manhattan Madam, Anna Gristina. He was standing next to dozens of other videographers and photographers, but happened to be looking in the right direction. The criminal report reveals Creque, who lives just three blocks from where they carried out their alleged crime, was charged with criminal mischief and making graffiti. Her boyfriend stands accused of criminal mischief, making graffiti, resisting arrest and possession of graffiti instruments. Whether or not they agree to sign, he said he has printed them copies of the picture, which Ms Creque has already admired. In her message, 'she said she loved it,' he told MailOnline. 'Maybe they are proud of what they did. Maybe they think they did something artistic. The photograph captures that moment.' When it came to tracing the lovebirds, he took to social media. 'Help!!!' he wrote on his Facebook page on August 17. 'Does . anyone know who this couple is? It is very important. I took this photo outside Manhattan criminal . court on Thursday August 16th. 'I . entered this photo in a major contest which I am about to win and need . them to sign a release form. When this photo wins the contest, they will . be in a very big movie with famous actors and directors.' The competition is bringing together famous faces who will try their hand at film-making for the first time. Further details will be announced during the results next week, Mr Gelber said. The image is reminiscent of another moment captured in chaos. Last summer in Vancouver, Canada following a disappointing Stanley Cup loss of the Vancouver Canucks, couple Scott Jones and Alex Thomas had a moment of romance amid the riot. Getty Images photographer Richard Lam captured the two kissing on the ground, surrounded by riot police and softly illuminated by flames from burning cars and trash bins. In the mad attempt to identify Mr Jones following the snap, he was dubbed 'Riot Romeo.'

The charges were three counts of unlawful sex with a minor and three counts of oral copulation with a minor. The judge ordered Denman to post $82,500 bail by her next hearing on May 22. Denman has been barred from the classroom at Hoover High School in Fresno, California and is currently on paid administrative leave. Her lawyer Roger Nuttall entered her plea at Fresno County Superior Court during the short hearing. Outside court he said his client was 'embarrassed' by the charges which are believed to involve only one student. He said: 'These charges are very difficult for her because she is highly respected. We will deal with them and hope for the best.' 'Embarrassed': Megan Denman is on administrative leave from Hoover High School while the charges against her are investigated . It is now up to authorities to decide whether there is enough information for Denman to stand trial. Denman, who married 18 months ago, was arrested on April 9 but released after posting $55,000 bail. The inappropriate relationship came to light on April 5 when the student was pulled over driving a car belonging to his 29-year-old teacher. He was cited for a misdemeanor of driving without a license and without proof of insurance. The sexual activity reportedly took place off the   campus of Hoover High School while the student was 17. The young man, who has now turned 18, was reluctant to pursue criminal charges against Denman, according to the Fresno Bee. School chiefs expressed their 'deep disappointment' at Denman's arrest in a letter to parents earlier this month. Fresno Unified Superintendent Michael Hanson said: 'As we all know there have been incidents throughout the state of teachers taking advantage of the student/teacher relationship. 'Unfortunately, we have learned of an alleged inappropriate relationship between a teacher and student in our own district. Words cannot describe my deep disappointment in this alleged breach of teacher/student relationship. Hiding from view: Denman covered her head as she left the Fresno police station after posting $55,000 bail earlier this month . 'We have acted swiftly in taking the . appropriate action in removing the teacher from the classroom and the . school while these allegations are being investigated. 'The overwhelming majority of our . employees are working hard every day to assure the success of our . students and our work will not be derailed by these allegations. We are . cooperating fully with law enforcement.' Former students commenting on a media report on ABC30's website said they were stunned that Denman was involved with another student describing her as a 'role model'. Role model: Students said they were shocked by the allegations against the social studies teacher and one described the school as a place where 'rumors were started' One girl wrote: 'Ms Denman was my teacher of two years and also my cheer coach. I have spent enough time with her to know that she was a great teacher/role model and that this news is incredibly shocking to me. 'I can also say that Hoover is a high school with kids who like to start rumors and build bad reputations.'","Social studies teacher Megan Denman accompanied only by lawyer for court appearance today .

It could take the New York City subway system three full weeks to come back online, experts have warned. High water is preventing inspectors from quickly assessing damage, meaning the nation's largest city could face an extended shutdown of the system that 5million people count on each day. Joseph Lhota, chairman of the state agency that runs the subway, said service might have to resume piecemeal, and experts said the cost of repairs could be staggering. Scroll down for video . 100-year storm: Debris and flood waters filled the South Ferry subway station as a study predicted that New York's transport infrastructure would not be online for three weeks after 100-year storm . Historic shut down: As flood waters inundated many stations including 86th Street, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that subway service would be shut down until Saturday or Sunday, only the second time it has ever closed . Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced yesterday that the subway would be shut down until Saturday or Sunday – . a total closure of six to seven days. But . a group of Columbia University researchers analysing the effects of a . smaller hurricane or tropical storm suggest that it would shut down the subways for 21 days - and cost the economy tens of billions of dollars. The report by Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist who specializes in disaster . management, examined the effects on the city’s transportation . infrastructure of a 100-year storm. Dr Jacob and his researchers used as a model a storm less powerful than a superstorm such as Sandy – one that has only a one . per cent chance of happening in any given year. Subway submerged: A man takes a photograph of the flooded Whitehall Street station as dozens were damaged by the storm surge that rose water levels by 13 feet . Then report estimated that a hurricane hitting nearby could result . in a billion gallons of water flooding each of the subway’s 14 tunnels . that run under the East River. There has always been flooding in the tunnels, which collect storm water constantly, but the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said Sandy was the worst disaster in the subway’s 108-year history. Trains stopped running at 7pm on Sunday as the MTA preemptively closed down service for only the second time in its history. The closure was an effort to secure the subway system against the impending storm, but massive damage came anyway. Worst disaster: After several stations were damaged, including 86th Street station, the MTA said the Sandy Superstorm was the worst disaster in the subway's 108-year history . Limited bus service began again . yesterday and some bridges reopened at midday, but transit officials . said they could not predict when the subway would run again. One tunnel – the South Ferry station at Manhattan's southern end – was flooded entirely from 'track to the ceiling'. More than 468 stations and 600 miles of track now have to be carefully examined. Each tunnel was expected to take at least five days to pump dry after the tidal surge of almost 14 feet. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Rock . Island District deployed a team of engineers yesterday to support New . York colleagues in the 'unwatering'. Preemptive effort: Trains stopped running on Sunday night in an effort to secure the subway system, including a emergency dam erected at IRT Subway Lenox terminal . The team were specially trained in New Orleans, where they dealt with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and are preparing their large stock of pumps. Water in the two vehicle tunnels receded slightly as the tide fell Tuesday morning, but the massive pumps that will eventually empty the tubes were unable to immediately make headway because the places where they normally send water — the river and sewer system — remained so high, the outflow pipes in the pumping system were still submerged. 'Our pumps are working. It's just that the water has no place to go,' MTA spokeswoman Judy Glave said. 'We pump it out and it just comes back in.' Once the water is removed, engineers must then examine the equipment to see how much corrosion damage was wrought by the salt water that soaked the switches, signals, electrical wires and stations. Each has to be out of the water before it is touched and and any damage will have to be fixed before the system can be restored. Pump flood waters: Each tunnel is expected to take at leave five days to pump dry, keeping stations closed until Saturday or Sunday . 'In the tunnels under the East River, all the signal-and-control systems are underwater, and it is salt water,' Dr Jacob told the Wall Street Journal. 'It's not just that it doesn't work right now. It all has to be cleaned, dried, reassembled and tested. And we are not sure what the long-term corrosion effect might be. 'I think we have come to the end of studies. What we need now is action.' Governor Andrew Cuomo agreed. adding: 'We have to start thinking about how we redesign the system so this doesn't happen again. 'I don't think anyone can sit back anymore and say, ""I'm shocked at this weather pattern."" There is no weather pattern that can shock me anymore.' School was canceled for a third straight day Wednesday in the city, where many students rely on buses and subways to reach classrooms. Mayor Bloomberg has said that Sunday’s marathon will still take place, but even if runners are able to fly in, it will be difficult to get everyone to the starting line without a subway. Dr Jacob’s 21-day estimate covers the time it is predicted to . take city workers to bring the subway system back to 90 per cent . function.","The report examined the effects on the city's transportation infrastructure after a 100-year storm .

A woman with an extremely rare disorder that causes her to miscarry has given birth to a healthy baby boy. Gaynor Offland, 35, suffers from a life threatening condition that causes clots to form in her body. When doctors discovered pregnancy was the trigger, they advised her not to get pregnant because of the risks to her life and her unborn baby. Gaynor Offland suffers from a life threatening condition that causes clots to form in her body. It caused her to suffer three miscarriages before she gave birth to baby Oliver earlier this month . Yet she refused to give up on her dream of having a family and now thanks to treatment, she is a finally a mother . Ms Offland, from Telford, Shropshire, suffered the heartbreak of losing three babies, including twin girls at 24 weeks. Doctors at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital put her first miscarriage down to pre-eclampsia because the symptoms are almost identical. But after she lost her daughters in 2006, they decided to run tests. The results were sent to a specialist in London and Gaynor was diagnosed with an extremely rare condition called Congenital Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia Pupura (TTP), which causes clots to form in her body because of a missing enzyme in her blood plasma. The condition, which affects one in 30 million people, can lead to organ failure and even death.The clots can also block the blood flow to the placenta, cutting off the baby’s oxygen supply. Ms Offland with her partner, Alan Griffiths, and baby Oliver. Doctors had warned her becoming pregnant could kill her but she was desperate for a child . Ms Offland, a teaching assistant and her partner Alan Griffiths, 55, were stunned when they were told the condition was triggered by pregnancy. She said: 'It was a total shock - we didn’t know what the condition was or where it came from. No one in my family has ever had a problem. 'Doctors advised me not to get pregnant but I was determined. My life wasn’t going to be complete without a baby. 'Alan has three children from a previous relationship but I told him right from the start I wanted to be a mum.' In September last year, she discovered she was pregnant but lost the baby at seven weeks before doctors could begin treatment for her condition. She said: 'After the miscarriages, I started to think maybe I’d been put on earth to look after other people’s children and I wasn’t meant to have one of my own. 'I was also aware that I was getting older and the chances of conceiving were less and less.' Then in January this year, she discovered she was pregnant again. Her consultant advised her to take aspirin (known to thin the blood) and she also had to give herself daily injections in her stomach to prevent clots. When she reached 12 weeks, medics were able to start plasmapheresis, which involves removing her plasma and replacing it with donor plasma that contains the enzyme. Ms Offland said: 'I needed an operation to insert a catheter in my chest then I had to go to the hospital and be hooked up to a machine twice a week. 'It was such a when I made it past 24 weeks as that is the point when I usually miscarry. There wasn’t a day that went past when I wasn’t worried though. It was always at the back of my mind.' Doctors decided to induce her at 37 weeks because it was too risky to keep the baby in the womb any longer. She was also given double the amount of plasma the week before the birth. Oliver, who has been hailed a miracle by doctors, was born on October 2, weighing a healthy 6lb 15oz. Ms Offland underwent daily injections and twice-weekly blood transfusions to prevent her developing blood clots that could kill Oliver, who was born earlier this month . 'Until I heard him cry, I refused to believe he was okay,' said Ms Offland. 'The care from the hospital has been spot on, I couldn’t have asked for better. They have gone above and beyond. 'A lot of people have helped to bring Oliver into the world. He wouldn’t be here without all those people who donated blood. I can’t thank them enough. 'The birth really brought back memories of the babies I’d lost but we had a happy ending this time instead of a sad one.' The condition is genetic so Oliver may pass it on to his children in the future but he has been given a clean bill of health so far. The hospital has now named its two machines after Gaynor and Oliver in their honour. Oliver, who weighed a6lb 15oz when he was born, has been described by doctors as 'a miracle' Mr Griffiths, a park ranger, said: 'I knew how much Gaynor wanted a baby - she was willing to put life on the line for it and I couldn’t have said no. I didn’t think I’d be changing nappies again at my age but I couldn’t be happier.'Dr Sreekanth Reddivari, consultant haematologist at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'Only around 100 cases of Congenital Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia Pupura aredescribed worldwide. 'Untreated, it has a mortality rate close to 90%. Therefore in the past, Gaynor was advised not to become pregnant again because of the risks to her own life. “However, with time Gaynor decided that she would brave the risks if there was a chance of having a live baby. 'The hospital is extremely proud to help her achieve her dream - it's nothing short of a miracle.' Ms Offland added: 'It took a long time to have him and has been a roller coaster, but it was all worth it. It’s still not sunk in yet and I can’t take my eyes off him.'","Gaynor Offland, 35, suffers from a life threatening condition that causes clots to form in her body, triggering miscarriage .

Spot the difference: Natalie Westerman, 22, has received a barrage of abuse over Twitter following the bank's IT problems - because her username is NatWest . The English and Media teacher has received more than 200 tweets from irate NatWest customers. She said: 'I joined Twitter about five years ago, when it wasn’t such a huge thing and was only really big in America at the time. 'I chose the username NatWest because that has been my nickname since school. 'It wasn’t until about six months later that I started to get a few comments from people mistaking me for the bank. 'I would just re-direct them and tell them they had made a mistake. 'Companies such as NatWest had not actually started using Twitter yet.

I have had a few abusive messages in the past but most of the time it’s just people asking me where their money is.' Identity crisis: The English and media teacher says she finds the confusion funny - and won't be changing her name . Ms Westerman has set her profile description as ‘I’m a 22 year old woman and I’m not a bank’ - but still gets mistaken for the banking giant. Bank boss Stephen Hester faced calls to resign today as the computer chaos at NatWest ran into a sixth day, prompting the Treasury to monitor the situation. The bank was this morning still unable to confirm when customer accounts would be returned to normal - almost a week after a systems failure that has left wages unpaid and customers unable to withdraw money, pay bills or use credit cards. Mr Hester, who is chief executive of the taxpayer-funded RBS Group, which owns NatWest, has promised that 'no one will be left permanently out of pocket' by the computer glitch. A Twitter user called DAZER asked Ms Westerman: 'Oi @Natwest can I have my money please :('.

She added: 'My friends find it hilarious when I tell them about all the messages I have received. 'I am a teacher and when I recently told the children about what had happened they found it very funny. 'I don’t think that I am going to change my username because I have got friends on Twitter from New Zealand and I don’t want to lose them.

A 'super' strain of untreatable gonorrhea is sweeping developed countries across the world including Britain and Northern Ireland. The sexually transmitted disease, which infects millions of people every year, is becoming resistant to all antibiotics, according to the World Health Organisation. The  U.N. health agency is urging governments and doctors to step up surveillance of the STD, the second most common after chlamydia. Dangerous mutations: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterium that causes Gonorrhea, is developing new strands resistant to every treatment . Gonorrhea can cause inflammation, infertility, pregnancy complications and, in extreme cases, lead to maternal death. Babies born to mothers with gonorrhea have a 50 per cent chance of developing eye infections that can result in blindness. 'This organism has basically been . developing resistance against every medication we've thrown at it,' said . Dr Manjula Lusti-Narasimhan, a scientist in WHO's department of STDs. This includes a group of antibiotics called cephalosporins currently considered the last line of treatment. Resistance to cephalosporins was first . reported in Japan, but more recently has also been detected in Britain, . Australia, France, Sweden and Norway. As these are all countries with . well-developed health systems, it is likely that cephalosporin-resistant . strains are also circulating undetected elsewhere. More than 17,000 new cases of gonorrhea were reported in the UK in 2009. Young men and women are affected most – the highest rates of gonorrhea are seen in women aged 16-19 and men aged 20-24. 'I . think this is probably only the tip of the iceberg,' said Professor . Catherine Ison, who oversees the national surveillance program for . treatment of resistant gonorrhea in England and Wales. Clap: Disease used to be rife among sailors, soldiers and prostitutes as this American sexual hygiene poster warns . Doctors have blamed overuse or misuse of antibiotics for the disease moving towards becoming a superbug, coupled with the bacteria's astonishing ability to adapt. Professor Ison said doctors in Britain are now switching to . using a combination of antibiotics over a longer period of time to . combat resistant gonorrhea. Dr Lusti-Narasimhan said that better sex education was needed, . as proper condom use is an effective means of stopping transmission. 'We're not going to be able to get rid of it completely,' she said in an interview ahead of WHO's public announcement on its 'global action plan' to combat the disease. 'But we can limit the spread. Concern: The STD is the second most common in the UK and affects more than 17,000 people a year (posed by model) 'In a couple of years it will have become resistant to every treatment option we have available now.' Dr Lusti-Narasimhan said the new guidance is aimed at ending complacency about gonorrhea and encouraging researchers to speed up their hunt for a new cure. Once considered a scourge of sailors and soldiers, gonorrhea - known colloquially as the clap - became easily treatable with the discovery of penicillin. Now, the global health body estimates that gonorrhea is responsible for 106million infections annually. It also increases the chances of infection with other diseases, such as HIV. 'It's not a European problem or an African problem, it's really a worldwide problem,' said Dr Lusti-Narasimhan. These bacteria survive antibiotic treatment due to a mutation that makes them resistant, then quickly spread their genes in an accelerated process of natural selection. This is a general problem affecting all antibiotics, but gonorrhea is particularly quick to adapt because it is good at picking up snippets of DNA from other bacteria, said Dr Lusti-Narasimhan. 'If it didn't do so much damage it would actually be a fun organism to study,' she said. The over-the-counter availability of low potency antibiotics in some Asian countries is another reason resistance is increasing, she said. The Geneva-based WHO wants countries not just to tighten their rules for antibiotic use but also to improve their surveillance systems so that the full extent of the problem can be determined.","Babies born to gonorrhea-infected mothers have 50 per cent chance of being blind .

'Ailments': Lois Goodman, center, with her attorney, Allison Triessl, who claimed the 70-year-old tennis referee could not have murdered her husband as she has arthritis and needs a shoulder replacement . Goodman, who is well-known in professional tennis circles, stands accused of murdering her husband, Alan, at their condominium in Los Angeles, California on April 17 by smashing a coffee mug over his head and stabbing him to death with the sharp, broken handle. The mother of three told authorities she had arrived home to find the blood-covered coffee mug and her husband lying in bed not breathing after apparently falling down the stairs. But after paramedics and investigators became suspicious of the man's grisly injuries - including deep wounds to his head - Goodman was arrested on a murder charge. She was arrested last week in New York, . where she was preparing for this week's U.S. Open - just one . of many high-profile tournaments she had worked since 1979. She was extradited back to Los . Angeles and her lawyer has now pleaded with a judge to reduce her $1 . million bail to $100,000 or release her on electronic monitoring. Arrest: Goodman was arrested for murder by NYPD last week while still wearing her U.S. Open uniform . Plea: She was extradited back to Los Angeles for her trial, but her lawyer has asked for her bail to be reduced . 'Mrs. Goodman is not a danger to any person or the community,' Triessl wrote in the motion. She said there was no chance Goodman would flee as she does not have a passport and has strong ties to the San Fernando Valley where she was born and raised. She added that Goodman cooperated with the police investigation and submitted to three interviews, even driving herself to the police station when she was summoned. 'She arrived on time and was utterly forthcoming,' Triessl said. Given Goodman's cooperation, she said the Los Angeles Police Department should have waited to arrest her; they could have asked her to turn herself in in California and she would have obliged. Triessl also gave the court 40 . testimonial letters from colleagues, neighbours, family and friends, . lauding Goodman as a beloved friend, mother and grandmother who treated . her husband like a king. 'Victim': Her husband of nearly 50 years, Alan (left), was found covered in blood next to a broken coffee mug. His wife told police she had found him after returning home and believed he had fallen . Scene: But authorities became suspicious by his injuries and Goodman's conflicting accounts. He was found dead at their condominium on April 17 in Woodland Hills, pictured . She has a bail hearing set for Wednesday. After police swooped on her as she had breakfast in her New York hotel last week, the elderly tennis referee was pictured in her U.S. Open tracksuit as she was ferried between courts. Claims have also emerged that she was having an affair, after police found emails and handwritten letters to another man during a search of the house. 'Lois minimised what she had seen,' Detective Jeffrey Briscoe of the Los Angeles Police Department said of an interview four days after the death. 'Lois’ emotional reaction to what she had seen and the loss of her husband was not typical of a grieving spouse.' She had told detective she arrived home and found a trail of blood leading upstairs to a broken mug covered in blood. She followed the blood to her bedroom, where she found her husband not breathing, according to the affidavit. She then called 911. Questions: Goodman, right, features in a sketch in a Manhattan court last Friday before she was sent to L.A. Before he could be cremated, investigators intercepted the body and found multiple lacerations on the right side of his head, three cuts on his right ear and a blunt force trauma not consistent with a fall, the Daily News reported. Investigators also deemed the large stain of blood near the stairs suggested he had suffered an injury and stayed there for some time, court documents said. When she was questioned again, Goodman said the body looked as if it had been positioned by an intruder. Despite these conflicting accounts, Goodman has protested her innocence. She has refereed at the U.S. and Australian Opens for years and has umpired with some of the world's top tennis players, including matches with Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova. In a 1994 interview with the L.A. Times, she said: 'It's exciting. This is my favorite sport and I'm out there rubbing shoulders with the best players. There's no real way to describe it.'","Lois Ann Goodman 'has string of ailments including two knee replacements, shoulder replacement, arthritis, hearing loss and spinal pain'

A UK town home to around 13,000 people has absolutely no police officers protecting it at times during the week, a whistleblower has said. Budget cutbacks mean Uttoxeter in Staffordshire sometimes has no-one to uphold the law and incredibly the force in charge says its strategy 'makes sense'. A whistle-blower has revealed two officers from the town are diverted to Stoke-on-Trent on Monday nights to help police their student night. Complaint: The whistleblower says Uttoxeter is being left un-policed at times because officers are sent to Stoke-on-Trent (pictured) This leaves either one or none at all left in Uttoxeter and the anonymous serving policeman claims it is ‘highly unlikely’ the town would be policed after midnight. In a devastating critique of a system he has served for more than 25 years, the whistleblower said the ‘thin blue line’ is now so stretched that officers from Burton-Upon-Trent - some 13 miles away - are being forced to cover. Between zero and three officers hold the fort in Uttoxeter, where the station’s strength was previously as high as four or five constables and a sergeant, he said. 'We think we are just being run ragged,' he said. 'We are sticking plasters over a system that’s crumbling. 'I’m concerned, and I know officers I work with are also concerned, about the service we are giving members of the public. 'We joined to put something back into society and I know we are all disappointed we are not able to do the job we joined to do - that’s prevent crime and police the streets and make them safer. 'We understand cuts have to be made but we’re finding services are suffering because of cuts to staff and the way we are being managed.' Andy Adams, joint branch chairman of Staffordshire Police Federation, said the whistleblower had highlighted a force-wide problem in which certain areas were ‘not being staffed to the same degree’. 'We anticipated this 18 months ago and it appears it’s now beginning to happen,' he said. The claims emerged five years after former Burton constable Stuart Davidson revealed he was the author of best-selling ‘whistleblower’ book Wasting Police Time and popular internet diary Coppersblog - both withering exposes of the political correctness, target culture and red tape blighting policing. But Staffordshire Police has hit back, pointing out that despite ‘challenging times’ borne of a need to save £34 million by March 2015, crime levels were the lowest in more than 10 years and victim satisfaction rates high. They also say leaving Uttoxeter as an almost police-free zone on Monday ‘makes sense’ as it uses resources better. But the force admits that while it has to make savings of £34 million by March 2015 with 86 per cent of our budget spent on staff costs, it is unavoidable that the organisation has to operate with fewer people. Chief Inspector Steve Maskrey, East Staffordshire Borough Local Policing Team commander, said: 'These are challenging times and we have been working very hard over the last two years to restructure the force and transform services while protecting service delivery to our communities. 'Dealing with what matters to our communities and having the right staff in the right place at the right time is key. 'The public expect us to deliver value for money services and this means adopting a common sense approach. 'If we have demand on a particular night in one town and not another, for example student night in Burton is Thursday, whereas student night in Stoke-on-Trent is Monday, it makes sense to move some of our resources to cover this demand while ensuring sufficient resources are in place in the remaining areas. 'Many of our staff have experienced big change but have reacted brilliantly and crime levels are the lowest in more than 10 years. 'Crime levels for the first five months of this financial year are down in Uttoxeter town by seven per cent, a total of 203 reported crimes compared to 219 last year. 'It is a tribute to all staff that at a time when budgets are reducing significantly and the organisation is shrinking, crime continues to fall and victims’ satisfaction rates remain very high.'","Police from Uttoxeter being sent to cover Stoke-on-Trent on Mondays .

A terrified couple were forced to drive their car with a giant, deadly snake under the car bonnet. Marlene Swart and Leon Swanepoel watched on in horror as they saw a 16 foot python slither through the grass and up underneath their car bonnet while they were on holiday in Kruger National Park in South Africa. The couple from Brits in South Africa were looking out for lions when they came across the python just before it disappeared under their car and settled on the engine, refusing to move. Hissing car: A South African couple were horrified when a 16 foot long python slithered underneath their car and settled under the car bonnet in Kruger National Park in South Africa . Ms Swart, 38, and Mr Swanepoel, 51, were then forced to endure a three mile journey to a nearby lookout point with the python in tow. Ms Swart said: ‘It was certainly a once in a lifetime experience that we will never forget. ‘I was totally in shock and terrified. ‘When we spotted a couple of safari vehicles on the road we thought it was the lions we were looking for but we were informed there was a python in the grass. Stubborn snake: The python refused to move from its hiding place so the couple had to drive three miles to a lookout before they could coax it out . Coaxing: A man cajoled the python from the car as tourists watched on in trepidation . ‘While we were searching the snake suddenly sailed out of the grass directly in our direction. ‘I waved to the vehicle behind us asking him to reverse but he didn't realise what was going on. ‘The python disappeared underneath our car and about two minutes later everyone started laughing when it failed to reappear.’ At the lookout they built up the courage to open the car bonnet. Ms Swart said: ‘When we eventually opened the bonnet the snake was just relaxing on the bonnet watching all of the commotion around him. The man had to pick up the huge snake before it slithered away . ‘It eventually sailed away unharmed and luckily there was no damage to the car. ‘Later that evening we had a good chuckle about the reactions of the bystanders when it exited the vehicle. ‘People were scattering in all directions, I'm only disappointed that I was numb with fear and shock and didn't take more pictures.’ The national park is the largest game reserve in South Africa and is home to some 114 reptile, 507 birds and 147 mammal species across 7332 square miles. The African Rock Python is the continent’s largest snake with females growing up to 16 foot long and males up to 14 foot. The park dates back to 1898, when it was founded as the Sabie Game Reserve, in an attempt to control hunting in the area. It did not see a tourist until 1927, however – one year after it took on National Park status. Each year about 950,000 people visit Kruger and 80 per cent of those visitors are South African. Numb with fear: Ms Swart wished she had taken more photos but was frozen with fear and shock thanks to the unwelcome visitor .","Marlene Swart and Leon Swanepoel watched in horror as a 16 foot python slithered under their car and settled under the car bonnet .

A popular Mexican food restaurant chain is being sued after waitresses at a Hawaii branch claimed the CEO and high level managers sexually harassed them and demanded sex. Staff at the Senor Frog's bar and restaurant in Waikiki, which closed down in August, allege that male managers groped female workers' breasts and buttocks and demanded sex from them. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is suing La Rana Hawaii LLC, the Hawaii unit of Senor Frog's parent company, Grupo Anderson's. Lawsuit: Staff at the Senor Frog's restaurant in Honolulu, pictured, claim the company's CEO and other high level executives sexually harassed them . Papers filed by the agency filed to the federal court in Honolulu on Thursday accuse managers of making graphic, inappropriate and offensive sexual comments on a daily basis. The allege employees were encouraged - with at least two claiming they were directed - to have sex with high level executives when they visited Honolulu, including the chain's CEO, named as David Krouham in the court papers. They also accuse managers of routinely urged employees, many of whom were under legal drinking age, to drink alcohol with them. The complaint names five managers and three senior executives. Amrita Mallik, a senior trial attorney for the commission, said: 'One of the reasons we were so concerned about this case is we saw this harassing behavior permeated up to the most senior levels of management. That was a real problem and a real concern for us.' 'This was a company that seemed to disregard the rights of the women who worked there.' Most of the nine alleged harassment victims were students in their teens and early 20s who were working at the restaurant in their first ever job while also studying. Managers allegedly retaliated against them if they complained, by giving the workers fewer hours, fewer shifts, and assigning them to cover slower parts of the restaurant where they would earn fewer tips. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed a lawsuit at the Prince Kuhio Federal Court Building in Honolulu, pictured, on behalf of the women . Senor Frog's opened its Waikiki restaurant in 2007 and closed it in August of this year. A former employee first made the accusations to the commission in April 2008. The commission initially filed a complaint in December 2011 after attempts to negotiate a settlement failed. It filed an amended lawsuit Friday. The complaint seeks lost wages, compensation and punitive damages as well as policy changes and staff training. The lawsuit also names Altres Inc. - a Hawaii company Senor Frogs hired to handle payroll and paperwork. It alleges at least four workers reported the harassment to Altres human resources staff as directed by the employee manual but Altres failed to take action and allowed the harassment to continue. Altres CEO Barron Guss said Friday that it thoroughly investigated the one complaint it received and reported it back to Senor Frog's management. Mr Guss said: 'It's not our role to come in and stop harassment and all those things. We can only report on what we find.' Altres and Senor Frog's ended their contract at the end of 2008. Senor Frog's were unavailable for comment. A phone call to Grupo Anderson's went unanswered. Most businesses in Mexico were closed Friday for a national holiday, Dia de Los Muertos.","Women worked at the Senor Frog's bar and .

As hundreds of Apple fans around the world spent the night queuing for the latest iPhone, it has been revealed that Americans have spent some $5.9 billion on repairing the device since the first edition was released in 2007. A one-year warranty is provided by Apple on iPhones, but this covers product malfunction as opposed to user clumsiness. The primary reason for a damaged iPhone was the device being dropped by a user. The second-most cited reason was 'immersing the phone in liquid' such as dropping it in the toilet or in a drink. Passing the time: There was a lot of camaraderie between fans in the line at Apple's Fifth Avenue store, pictured . The prize: Apple's new iPhone 5, which has been eagerly awaited . SquareTrade, a company that provides . independent warranties for tech gadgets, surveyed more than 2,000 iPhone . users, reported TIME Moneyland. They asked users about how they had damaged their phones, then extended the cost of repairs, replacements and insurance deductibles . across the mass of iPhone users. The average price of repairing an iPhone screen is usually between $100 and $150. According to SquareTrade, 11 per cent of iPhone owners are happy to carry on using the device with a cracked screen. They also said that six per cent of users have used tape to keep their phone together. Number one: Sag Catharsis, 31, pictured, will be the first in New York to get the new iPhone after queuing since last Thursday . Peace: Police officers were on site at New York's Fifth Avenue Apple store pictured, but said there had been no disturbances and the crowd was well behaved . Goodbye 4S: Bilal Hassan, 21, left, and Suren Petrosyan, also 21, right, were hoping to sell the iPhone for up to $1,200 . Apple frenzy: IPhone fans lined up at New York's Fifth Avenue store in the early hours of Friday morning to be among the first to get the new handset . Repairs: The primary reason for a damaged iPhone was the device being dropped by a user . But Ty Shay, chief marketing officer . of SquareTrade, does point out to the website that the usage of mobile . phones has increased significantly since the iPhone was first relased, . thereby increasing the risk of accidents. But the cost of repairs has not deterred users. From London to New York to Sydney, fans have camped outside Apple stores for the latest release, the iPhone 5. As Apple opened the doors of its stores around the world, staff greeted the first customers with high fives and cheers. The dozens of die-hard Apple fans had swollen into huge queues of hundreds by the early hours of Friday morning, as excitement reached fever pitch hours before the release of the updated handset. Although the majority were there to get their hands on their own new iPhone, the anticipation surrounding its release has reached such levels that many were planning on making a quick buck by selling the handsets for as much as $1,200 -- close to double the retail price. In London, many were prepared to sell their place in the queue for four-figure sums and Apple fans in New York were also planning to tout their positions to the many workers passing by before the 8am opening time. At Fifth Avenue Apple store in the Big Apple, the frontrunners for the gadget had already been queuing since last Thursday, putting up with the rough sleeping to get their hands on the sought-after device first.","Primary reason for a damaged iPhone was device being dropped by a user .

They film every morning to produce a roughly half-hour episode of the show each day and though the birth of their daughter wasn't broadcast live, the 20-minute film was edited into the next day's episode. It shows Mrs Saccone-Joly in her private room at the hospital texting friends during the labour. She is then seen inhaling gas and air while describing how she is 'in a lot of pain'.

Protests over the American anti-Islam film that has sparked chaos across the Muslim world continued in London yesterday as thousands of demonstrators marched on the offices of Google. More than 3,500 British Muslims, some from as far afield as Glasgow, waved banners and chanted slogans outside the search engine's UK headquarters to demand the company removes the film from the internet. The low-budget movie, entitled The Innocence of Muslims, portrays the Prophet Muhammad as a . fool and a sexual deviant, and has sparked a torrent of anti-American unrest . in Arab and Muslim countries since its release on YouTube last month. Anger: Barricades were erected as thousands of Muslims marched with banners bearing an array of slogans . But Google, who own the video-sharing website, remained defiant today claiming the film is 'clearly within our guidelines and so will stay on YouTube'. A spokesman for the company said: 'We work hard to create a community . everyone can enjoy and which also enables people to express different . opinions. 'This can be a challenge because what's OK in one country can be offensive elsewhere.' The protest had been billed as a precursor to a million-strong march planned in Hyde Park in the coming weeks. 'Global civility': Women grouped together in the protest which stretched from Google's offices on Buckingham Palace Road . Slogans: Muslims from all backgrounds waved placards bearing slogans such as 'We love our prophet more than our lives' and 'Prophet Muhammad is the founder of freedom of speech' as well as these above . Organiser Masoud Alam told the Daily Telegraph: 'Our next protest will be at the offices of Google and YouTube across the world. We are looking to ban this film. 'This is not freedom of expression, there is a limit for that. This insult of the Prophet will not be allowed.' Muslims from all backgrounds chanted and waved placards bearing slogans such as 'We love our prophet more than our lives' and 'Prophet Muhammad is the founder of freedom of speech'. They also listened to speeches from imams in English, Urdu and Arabic. 'Insult to the Prophet will not be allowed': They also listened to speeches from imams in English, Urdu and Arabic . One of the speakers, Sheikh Faiz Al-Aqtab Siddiqui, told The Daily Telegraph: 'Terrorism . is not just people who kill human bodies, but who kill human feelings as . well. The makers of this film have terrorised 1.6 billion people.' The march, during which no arrests were made, was in stark contrast to the wave of violent riots that spread across the Muslim world in the wake of the 14-minute film a month ago.

The most violent protests came over four days of demonstrations across the Arab world, stretching . from Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Lebanon, Palestinian territories, Israel, . Sudan, Nigeria, Tunisia and Pakistan, and even Australia. YouTube has already blocked access to the video in some countries such as Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and India.

A lost squadron of Spitfires that has been buried in the Burmese jungle since the end of the Second World War is to be dug up and brought back to Britain. Aircraft enthusiast David Cundall spent 15 years and £130,000 of his own money tracking down the aircraft. Up to 60 planes were buried in transport crates at a secret location 40ft below ground at the end of the war to ensure they didn’t fall into enemy hands. David Cundall, from North Lincolnshire, discovered 20 Spitfires buried in crates in Burma - and they will now be excavated for display . Saved for posterity: At least 60 Spitfires are believed to be buried - and they will hopefully be proudly displayed once again thanks to the 16-year hunt . The Spitfires are believed to be in good . condition because they were waxed, wrapped in greased paper and had . their joints tarred by RAF crews. The excavation is due to start at the end of the month after an agreement was signed with the military regime in Rangoon. Mr Cundall, 62, a farmer from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, started his . treasure hunt in 1996 after hearing a throwaway remark from a group of . US veterans who said they once buried Spitfires in Burma. The fighter planes – of which there are only around 35 left flying in . the world – were shipped to Burma and transported by rail to a British . RAF base in August 1945. But they were deemed surplus to requirements and unsuited to the . ‘island-hopping’ missions to clear the Japanese of their remaining . strongholds in the Pacific. Mr Cundall tracked down an eyewitness who led him to the area where the aircraft were buried. He eventually located the buried planes using ground-penetrating radar equipment. His team dug a borehole and sent down a camera to look at the crates, which were said to be in ‘really good condition’. One of the Spitfires (pictured: the tail fins) being crated up in Burma in 1945 ready to be buried . Images showed the Spitfires inside the containers with their wings packed alongside them. The planes will now be dug up and brought back to the UK to be . reassembled. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We hope that many of them . will soon be gracing the skies of Britain.’ The deal went ahead after Prime . Minister David Cameron signed a heritage agreement with Burmese . President Thein Sein during his visit to the south-east Asian nation in . April. The excavation agreement was signed on . Tuesday by Mr Cundall, Burma's civil aviation chief Tin Naing Tun and . the Shwe Taung Paw company boss Htoo Htoo Zaw, Mr Cundall's partner in . the country . Mr Zaw said: 'This will be the largest number of Spitfires in the world. We want to let people see those historic fighters.' Mr Cundall's treasure hunt was sparked . in 1996 by a throwaway remark from a group of U.S. veterans who said . they had once buried Spitfires in the Burmese jungle.

Fascinating maps have emerged that show the evolution of the London Underground from the early chaotic diagrams to the modern, familiar ones commuters use today. They are an incredible record not only of the expanding tube system beneath the capital’s streets, but also the transformation in how the railway was depicted. The maps, all duplicates produced at the same time as the originals, will go on sale in London this week and are expected to fetch thousands of pounds per item. Look familiar? This map, dated from as far back as 1919 bares little resemblance to the modern day London Underground maps . Leaps and bounds: Seven years later, in 1926, this map by Reginald Percy Gossop has changed drastically from its 1919 counterpart . The major change came to the mapping of the network in 1933 when . engineer Harry Beck drew his own map as a diagrammatic representation of . the subterranean system. He cleverly realised that commuters did not need to know the exact route the trains took, just the order of the stops. This is the one we are familiar with today and was what inspired underground network maps across the world. The examples coming up for sale tomorrow are duplicates owned by the London Transport Museum. The Underground maps begin in 1919 with one titled “Map of Underground including the Watford (L&N WR) Section”. This uses just two colours - red and black - to show the lines of the railway and their true, meandering routes. A 1926 version shows the tubes on the same map as the River Thames and the road network, and the colour yellow has been added to one line.Already in the 1920s Londoners were fascinated by the cartography depicting the city as is shown by a quirky map from 1928. On it, the tube is superimposed on an 18th century map of the capital. Ever evolving: This 1928 map by F. H. Stingemore is expected to sell for more than £2,000 and has reverted to a more familiar colour scheme . All Ways To The River: This curiously titled map by Charles Burton was produced in 1932 and even has pictures of boats on the Thames . Revert to type: F. H. Stingemore was back on the case in 1933, developing a similar map to his 1928 version . A Latin couplet at the bottom of the 1928 Underground Map upon the 1761 map states: 'This old map of London teaches you how many Underground roads there are today.' Then in 1933 Mr Beck came up with his version that he completed in his own time and initially his Underground bosses were sceptical. Sophie Churcher from Christie’s, which is selling the maps, said: “The London Underground Museum has a big archive and is selling some of its duplicate posters. 'This is to raise money for new acquisitions and conserve its existing stock. 'Among the collection are a series of London UNderground maps and through them you can see the network growing and growing. 'At first the maps followed the actual routes the trains took and they became more complicated as more track was laid. 'Then in 1933 Henry Beck revolutionised the process by coming up with the diagrammatic representation of the Underground. Iconic: Harry Beck's 1933 map is remarkably similar to the version commuters use today . A similar shape: This 1934 Underground map, titled Central Area Map, started to take on a recognisable form . Getting there: Harry Beck's maps were a revolution after he came up with the diagrammatic representation that is used as today's model. The above was produced in 1937 . 'The different colours were already being used but his map is the one we are now familiar with. 'Beck was an engineer and draughtsman who worked on the Underground but at first his bosses were sceptical about the idea. 'But it clearly worked and influenced Underground maps around the world. 'The collection is also interesting because some of the maps include proposed routes that were never completed, such as a line to Muswell Hill. 'There is lots of cross appeal for these posters which were printed on surprisingly thin paper. 'They were made to be put up on the Underground, but were clearly expected to be replaced regularly.' The maps go through to the early 1940s when the Underground was utilised by Londoners escaping the Blitz. They are expected to sell for several thousand pounds each at the sale in London. Astounding: Beck's 1938 version looks a far cry from the earlier ones . Still going: Ten years later, in 1948, Beck produced this map which possesses a striking resemblance to the present day's . Where we are now: Today's map looks extremely similar to those produced by Beck 80 years ago . As a solution to solve the problems of increased traffic congestion, the 1855 Act of Parliament was passed giving a green light to the construction of an underground rail network between Paddington and Farringdon Street via King’s Cross. It was to be named the Metropolitan Railway. The railway finally opened in 1863 and the following year the Hammersmith and City Railway opened. The underground railways rapidly expanded and eventually incorporated New Cross on the East London Railway and Whitechapel and Hounslow and Wimbledon on the District. The Metropolitan expanded into the north-east of the city, creating a new suburb dubbed ‘Metro-land’ in the process which included Chesham, Watford and Harrow. With the advancement of digging technologies, by the late 19th century the first tube lines were being created, and in 1890 the City and South London Railway, which now comprises of part of the Northern line, was opened. In 1900 the Central London Railway – now known as the Central line – was opened, which spanned from Bank to Shepherd’s Bush. Three years later the various privately owned railways merged into a London Passenger Transport Board, known as London Transport.  Harry Beck also drew his first Underground map in the current style in 1933. In 1948, the Labour government – along with the four mainline railway companies – nationalised the ever-expanding network, becoming the London Regional Transport, which was eventually replaced by Transport for London in 2000.","Incredible records of London's expanding Underground network has emerged, spanning from 1919 maps to Harry Beck's iconic designs .

Outspoken: Tory MP Douglas Carswell criticised George Osborne saying: 'There has been no austerity at all' An outspoken Tory MP risks a backlash from families in financial crisis and the Government after suggesting the Chancellor has done little to bring down public spending. Douglas Carswell, MP for Clacton, claimed: 'There has been no austerity at all! No austerity,' during an interview. The MP, who was educated at the £30,000-a-year Charterhouse School, added: 'George Osborne has talked about austerity, what austerity? 'In the second and third quarter of this year, the deficit has gone up by 20 per cent. We’re due to reduce it by 5 per cent this year, that figure is for the birds!' Mr Carswell, 41, made the comments during an interview with business website London Loves Business, to promote his new book ‘The End of Politics and the birth of iDemocracy’ in which he claims that ‘big government’ is becoming outdated with the rise of technology. Making enemies in high places? Mr Carswell risks a backlash after suggesting George Osborne has done little to bring down public spending . In the interview he criticised the Government saying: 'They just don’t get it' and made a swipe at the Prime Minister’s ‘Big Society’ project, calling it a 'passing fad.' Asked whether his personal economic manifesto amounted to a version of the Big Society he replied: 'I’m glad you know what the Big Society was all about, I didn’t. I hope this book, unlike the big society, is thought through. I hope it’s coherent.' The interview is likely to be seen as further evidence of a major rift within the Conservative party following several reports of plots to oust the Prime Minister. Outlining his theory about economic recovery, Mr Carswell said: 'I don’t think this government is even on the right page when it comes to this.' He added: 'If we leave it to politicians and officialdom to improve our livesand fix our country’s problems, we’re going to sink deeper into debtand deeper into the mire.'

These incredible pictures show an unlucky man who got too close to a testerone-fuelled stag and was forced to take refuge up a tree. The farcial scene took place at Bushy Park in West London and was captured on mobile phone by passer-by Lisa Acremom. The man was trapped after he wandered too close to two stags facing each other down, prompting one to break off from his showdown and chase him. Scroll down for video . Oh deer!: The man keeps the fenced-off tree between himself and the stag, which is currently full of testosterone for mating season. Stand-off: The black-clad pedestrian had to circle the tree as the aggressive stag jockeyed for position . It is currently mating season for the magnificent red deer, when the stags and bucks compete for females. At this time, the large males roar, bark and clash antlers in a spectacular way in an attempt to fight off rivals and attract as many females as possible. The footage shows the panicked man deperately trying to keep a fenced-off tree between him and the enraged, powerful beast's antlers. The pair jockey for position in a tense game of cat-and-mouse before the man calls out: 'I need some help here!' I give up: The stag at one point appears to get frustrated with the battle of wits and walks away... ...only to suddenly resume its offensive against the beleaguered man . At one point the stag, one of around 125 red deer that live in the park, appears to lose interest and trot away, only to suddenly wheel about and launch itself at his quarry, who once again moves into cover. Lisa, speaking to The Guardian, said: 'There were two stags parallel going to have a fight and all of a sudden a man has got too close and was chased by a stag, who was hopped up for rutting season. 'He was just walking along the path and stopped as he thought the stag was going to cross and it took its choice and went after the bloke instead of the other stag.' Desperate: The man is forced to take desperate measures as the stag is unwilling to let him get away . Can't follow me: The man climbs into the tree using the barrier, which wobbled alarmingly as he made his way to safety . Eventually the bearded man clambers up the rickety fence and into the tree to escape his bellowing tormentor. 'Nobody could get close to the bloke to help so when he went up the tree I dialled 101 and phoned the police,' Lisa added. With his prey out of sight, the deer moves on and police assisted the man out of his hiding place. Chiefs at The Royal Parks, the organisation which manages Bushy Park, are urging walkers, especially those with dogs, to take care during mating season, which takes place between September and October, as deer are wild animals and can behave unpredictably. Safety at last: The beast accepts defeat and walks away. Police later ensured the man was OK . Bill Swan, Bushy Park Assistant Manager, said: 'We are aware that this morning police assisted a man down from a tree where he had taken refuge after feeling threatened by a deer. 'During the deer mating season the male deer will be protecting their territory from rivals whilst rounding up  groups of female deer. 'The deer will be far more active than usual, running and behaving spontaneously and defensively.  It is safest to keep as distant as possible from them within the park during this time.  They are very strong and fast wild animals following powerful instincts. 'The Royal Parks have new signs on every gate and around the car parks warning of this and has used local media to remind visitors to the park that at all times and particularly during the deer mating season, it is important to be alert to your surroundings and maintain a minimum distance of 50m from deer. Never get in between the deer, never feed the deer and never photograph them at close range.' Deer have roamed freely in The Royal Parks since 1529. There are two million deer throughout Britain, more than at any time since the Norman Conquest, despite an annual cull of up to 350,000 animals.

Holby City star Rosie Marcel was told she would be raped and killed in a campaign of intimidation and abuse by a super-fan. Sarah Rumbelow, 21, has been jailed for two and a half years after she sent hateful emails, tweets, messages and letters to Miss Marcel, who plays surgeon Jac Naylor in the BBC drama. Rumbelow was completely obsessed with the actress and spent almost a year abusing her in 2011. Harassed: Sarah Rumbelow (left), who once posed for a picture with actress Rosie Marcel (right), became obsessed with the star and has been jailed for two-and-a-half years for threats sent on social networking sites . Victim: Actress Rosie Marcel was targeted by a stalker who sent her a barrage of threatening messages . To cover her tracks she set up bogus e-mail addresses from where she sent many sick messages. But after the terrified star called in the police detectives were able to establish Rumbelow was behind them. The . 21-year-old, of Brockley, south London pleaded guilty at St Albans . Crown Court to putting a person in fear of violence by harassment. The charge specified that between January 1 2011 and last autumn she posted threats to harm or kill Rosie on social network sites and sent threats by email and in letters. It was also revealed that she had breached a restraining order not to contact the actress. Simon Wilshere, prosecuting, told the court on Friday that the actress had received hateful communications during 2011 threatening her with both violence and sexual violence. He said there was 'an element of concealment' in the way Rumbelow had sent the communications because she had set up a variety of bogus accounts so her real identity would not be revealed. Even so Hertfordshire Police when called in were able to track her down and she was arrested last October and remanded in custody after masses of newspaper clippings and articles about the actress were found at her home . The 36-year-old married actress, who . lives near St Albans, is the daughter of television director Terry . Marcel and sister of writer and actress Kelly Marcel. In May Rumbelow appeared in custody before Judge John Plumstead to plead guilty to the charge of harassing Miss Marcel. Verdict: Obsessed Sarah Rumbelow breached a restraining order and told her victim she would be raped and killed, St Albans Crown Court heard . Job: Rosie Marcel plays surgeon Jac Naylor in BBC drama Holby City . By then it had been discovered she suffered from ADHD and Asperger's syndrome. The . judge adjourned sentence so that Rumbelow could be assessed to see if . she was suitable for treatment for her problems and a non custodial . sentence. He granted her bail and made a restraining order that she was not to contact the actress. However, after being released from custody, Rumbelow immediately set about sending the actress spiteful messages including one to her sister which said 'Your sister is finished. Rosie will get hers soon. Watch this space.' On Friday the court was told Rumbelow had again tried to cover her tracks and when arrested tried to shift the blame onto someone else. Alex Radley defending said Rumbelow had 'clear health issues' and asked the judge to consider passing a suspended sentence because treatment was available for her in the community. Judge Plumstead said 'This is a disturbed person’s crime, but it can’t be said she is free of blame.' Passing sentence he told Rumbelow: 'I don’t doubt that you are a young woman who has significant difficulties.' But, he said, her problems had not reduced her understanding that what she was doing was wrong. He jailed her for two and a half years, but told her the time she had spent in custody, a total of some nine months would count towards the time she serves. Miss Marcel was in court for Friday’s sentence. As she left the court with a friend, she said: 'It was a just sentence.

A man was crushed to death and two women were injured when a falling tree crashed onto two cars in fierce winds today, as 13 flood alerts were put in place across Britain amid warnings of more severe weather to come. The tree came down on a road close to Ascot racecourse in Berkshire this afternoon and smashed through two cars, fatally injuring the 64-year-old male driver of one of the vehicles. The man, who was from Sheffield, was flown to hospital by air ambulance but later died from his injuries. Severe weather: A person was spotted walking along the shore at Clarence Esplanade in Portsmouth, Hampshire, in the very early hours of this morning, as it was battered with huge waves coming from the sea . A female passenger in the Ford Mondeo, who is aged in her 60s, was also taken to hospital but her injuries were not serious. The female driver of the second car . was also taken to Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey after being cut free . from the wreckage of her blue Mini by firefighters. Her condition is not . believed to be life threatening. Emergency . services remained at the scene on the A332 Windsor Road tonight, where . staff from the local council were organising the removal of the fallen . tree. Firefighter Steve . Blackman, who attended the scene, said of the male driver: 'Obviously . he was a very poorly man so the helicopter rushed him away. 'The . woman in the Mini was very lucky, if she had been in the passenger side . she might not be here now. She was shaken up and a bit panicky.' The . tragedy occurred as parts of Britain prepared for further flooding and . travel disruption following heavy rain across the country. Bournemouth woman Sarah Marshall said she and her neighbours had a lucky escape last night after a six-tonne beech . tree crashed to the ground inches from their houses. Mrs Marshall, 43, who had to climb through a hedge to get in and out of her home, said: 'The tree is just huge and it's incredibly surreal seeing it in your drive way. We are lucky it didn't hit the house. 'The road is completely blocked and the council have been here to try and remove some of it. We can't get out of our property very easily as the driveway is the only route out.' Crash: A Beech tree completely blocked a road in Bournemouth last night, missing houses by inches . This close: Sarah Marshall said she was woken up by an 'explosion' as the tree almost crushed her house . Meanwhile, forecasters . told southern England and Wales to brace for ‘a wet one’ today, after deluges of up to an inch over the past 24 hours - and the Environment . Agency has 13 flood alerts in place. But northern areas are expected to . enjoy a mostly dry day today, and the outlook is much better across the . UK for the weekend - although southern areas could be hit by some rain . on Sunday. National forecaster the Met Office said 0.8 to 1.2in could fall tonight and into tomorrow. As much as 1.6in could fall on the high ground overnight. Further heavy prolonged rain is forecast for Sunday night, with another 0.8 to 1.2in falling in south west England and south west Wales, and up to 2.4in on the high ground. A spokesman warned it would be 'very wet and unpleasant' tonight and on Sunday into Monday when the rain hits, but tomorrow is likely to be dry and cloudy with some sunny spells. Blocked off: The huge Beech tree closed the road and also missed a bus stop only by inches . Dangerous: Mrs Marshall, 43, who had to climb through a hedge to get in and out of her home, said: 'The tree is just huge and it's incredibly surreal seeing it in your drive way.

'The tree is just huge and it's incredibly surreal seeing it in your drive way. We are lucky it didn't hit the house' Sarah Marshall, Bournemouth resident . A yellow warning urges the public to ‘be aware’ of severe weather. ‘The public should be aware of the possibility of disruption to travel due to localised flooding,’ the spokesman added. While the wet weather last night and today would not normally cause flooding, the risk is heightened because the ground in many areas is vulnerable following heavy rain towards the end of last month. Difficult drive: Flooding hit parts of Cornwall last night, causing problems for drivers in Perranwell this morning . Nick Prebble, a forecaster for . MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said 1.2in of . rain could hit areas of southern England and Wales today.

And this afternoon there was one flood warning in place - for the River . Ouse just south of York, which saw near-record river levels last week. The agency is warning of localised flooding today and tomorrow, with surface water affecting land and roads. Heavy rain: A satellite view, taken yesterday afternoon, shows a tropical storm blowing in east towards Britain . Looking ahead: Southern areas could expect temperatures of 14C (57F) to 15C (59F) over the next few days . A spokesman said: 'Further prolonged . heavy rain on Sunday may result in more significant disruption over . parts of south west England and Wales, such as flooding of communities . and travel disruption.' A lifeboat crew braved 70mph storm force winds early today to save a sailor on the coast. The drama began just after midnight in treacherous conditions when the 45ft yacht Sea Brigand reported problems with sails between Dartmouth and Kingswear in Devon. The yacht, with only the skipper on board, was having problems with its sail unfurling in high winds. The sailor was in danger of being thrown into the water in the wind and rain. When the lifeboat crew arrived the skipper was on the foredeck trying to stop the sail unfurling. The yacht was moved to the Darthaven Marina. Heavy rain began to move in across Devon, Cornwall and southern Wales late last night with up to 20mm falling in places during the early hours, Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst said. The weather expert said southern areas could expect temperatures of 14C (57F) to 15C (59F) over the next few days, with the London area reaching 17C (63F). Despite seeing spells of dry and sunny weather, northern areas will feel slightly cooler with temperatures between 12C (54F) and 14C (57F), Mr Dewhurst added. Yorkshire was the area worst hit by last week’s floods as more than the average rainfall for September fell in just a few days in many parts. A couple drowned in a swollen river in Wales and a block of townhouses in Newburn, Newcastle, were condemned to be knocked down after floodwater gouged out the earth under their foundations. More than 500 homes and businesses were flooded across England and Wales.","A man was crushed to death and two women were injured when a falling tree landed on top of two cars in Berkshire today .

The Executioner: Heriberto Lazcano was leader of the notorious Zetas cartel and is suspected to have masterminded hundreds of killings . The body of one of Mexico's most feared drug barons - known as The Executioner - has been snatched from a funeral home just hours after he was killed outside a baseball game by marines. Heriberto Lazcano and an accomplice died in a hail of bullets in a firefight with Mexican forces in the lawless badlands of Progreso, Coahuila, about 80 miles west of the Texas border, near Laredo, on Sunday night. Around 1.30am on Monday, just a few hours after the bodies had been studied, a group of armed men raided the funeral home where the bodies were being kept. They 'subdued' its staff and took both corpses in one of the funeral home's cars, Coahuila state Attorney General Homero Ramos said. Just after 8am, the owner of the funeral home called the attorney general's office to report that the body had been stolen, Ramos said. The bodies have yet to be recovered but fingerprints taken from the body before it disappeared confirmed it was the corpse of Lazcano. The former Mexican army commando was leader of the notorious Zetas cartel and is suspected to have masterminded hundreds of killings, . including the June 2004 slaying of Francisco Ortiz Franco, a top editor . of a crusading weekly newspaper in Tijuana that often reported on drug . trafficking. Lazcano, also known as 'El Verdugo' (the Executioner) for his brutality, was considered such an influential crime boss that the US government had put a $5million price on his head and Mexico an additional $2.3 million for information leading to his arrest. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Bullets in the dust: Lazcano was killed in the rural area of Progreso, Coahuila, about 80 miles west of the Texas border. It is known as a lawless badland where crime gangs regularly clash with heavily armed police and soldiers . 'Information was obtained after the . first forensics tests were carried out that yielded indications that . suggest that one of the bodies is Heriberto Lazcano,' the navy's . statement said. The navy said it received complaints . about armed men in the area and sent out a patrol to check out the . reports. Gunmen tossed grenades at the patrol from a moving vehicle, . wounding one of the marines. His injuries were not life-threatening. Two of the gunmen were killed in the . ensuing shootout, the navy's statement said. In the gunmen's' vehicle, . authorities found a grenade launcher, 12 grenades, what appeared to be . rocket propelled grenade launcher and two rifles. The Zetas, one of Mexico's most feared cartels, were founded by former soldiers of an elite army unit, including Lazcano, who defected from the Mexican military in 1998 to work as hired guns for drug traffickers. Identified in the nick of time: But within hours of Heriberto Lazcano body (pictured above) being taken to a morgue, a gang of armed men stormed the building and stole his body. His body was identified just in time . Deadly scene: A map shows where Lazcano, known as The Executioner, was gunned down by marines . They have since carved out their own . smuggling empire, expanded massively across Mexico and diversified into . kidnapping, extortion and theft of crude oil. Under Lazcano's rule, the Zetas are also responsible for some of Mexico's bloodiest massacres, biggest jail breaks and fiercest attacks on authorities. Lazcano, who is also known as 'El . Verdugo' (the Executioner) for his brutality, recruited hundreds of hit . men, many of them former Mexican soldiers, and hired 'kaibiles,' Guatemalan soldiers trained in counterinsurgency. In doing so he transformed what had . been a small group of assassins into a ruthless gang of enforcers for . the Gulf cartel. The Zetas also were in charge of protecting the Gulf . cartel's drug shipments. The . Zetas finally split from their former bosses in 2010 and have since . been fighting a vicious battle for control of the drug business in . northeastern Mexico, the traditional home base of the Gulf cartel. The . result has been a surge of drug-related killings. 'El Taliban': Another leader of the Zetas cartel, Ivan Velazquez Caballero, known as ""El Taliban,"" right, was captured by Mexican marines in September. He had allegedly been fighting a bloody internal battle with Zetas' leader Trevino Morales who has a reputation for being even more brutal than Lazcano . Another Zetas boss: Salvador Escobedo, aka The Squirrel (left), was arrested on Saturday. He is accused of murdering US citizen David Hartley, pictured with wife Tiffany, who was shot in the back of the head in 2010 . Lazcano . 'is credited with strengthening the organization ... he created a new . structure of regional cells that specialize in specific crimes,' Mexican . federal prosecutors say in their profile of Lazcano. The Zetas earned their notoriety for . brutality by becoming the first to publicly display their beheaded . rivals, most infamously two police officers in April 2006 in the resort . city of Acapulco. Even . with the death of Lazcano, the Zetas would still be run by a ruthless . capo, Miguel Angel Trevino Morales (pictured), who has a reputation for being even . more brutal than his predecessor.

The report of Lazcano's death came just hours after the navy nabbed a suspected Zetas regional leader accused of involvement in some of the country's most notorious crimes in recent years. Navy spokesman Jose Luis Vergara said Salvador Alfonso Martinez Escobedo was arrested on Saturday in Nuevo Laredo, across from Laredo, Texas. The official said Martinez is believed to have masterminded the massacre of 72 migrants in the northern state of Tamaulipas in 2010. The man known as 'Squirrel' also has been linked to the escape of 151 prisoners in 2010 from a jail in the city of Nuevo Laredo, the recent flight of 131 prisoners in the city of Piedras Negras and the killing of U.S. citizen David Hartley in 2010 on Falcon Lake, which straddles the U.S.-Mexico border. The death of Hartley drew wide attention as it appeared Hartley and his wife, Tiffany, were on a personal trip when he was shot by Mexican criminals on Sept. 30, 2010. The Hartleys were using personal watercraft on Falcon Lake when David Hartley was shot in the head and fell into the water. The navy is also blaming Martinez for the killing of the Tamaulipas state police commander and chief investigator on the case, an attack that hampered the investigation. The navy said Martinez is also a suspect in dozens of killings of people who were buried in mass graves at the same site of the 2010 massacre of migrants. Nearly 200 bodies were discovered in April 2011 in the town of San Fernando, close to the U.S. border. Those two crimes have been the most fatalities since Mexico's federal government launched an armed offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.","Heriberto Lazcano was leader of the notorious Zetas cartel and is suspected to have masterminded hundreds of killings .

Wearing a dark blue suit and black tie he was flanked by Princess Diana’s two sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, 55, and Lady Jane Fellowes, 53, for the 30-minute service at Parndon Wood Crematorium. The Prince had appeared calm and relaxed as he greeted fellow mourners outside the crematorium. He stood solemnly as the three-car funeral procession made its way up the road. More than 100 mourners attended the service to pay tribute to Mrs Powell, who lived in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire. Princess Diana's sisters Lady Jane Fellowes (left facing William) and Lady Sarah McCorquadale (right facing William) also attended the funeral in Harlow, Essex . Kate Middleton, The Duchess of Cambridge, remained in the North East for the royal engagements. Mrs Powell, who was widowed after just six years of marriage when she was 52, came to work for Princess Diana when Prince William was just six months old. Although very loving, she was renowned for not taking any nonsense from the young boys, and famously would give them a clip around their ear if they were ever naughty. Her smart semi-detached home was filled with pictures of the young princes and only last year she spoke excitedly about attending Prince William’s wedding to Kate Middleton.

Affectionate: The young princes under the careful eye of nanny Olga Powell at a polo match in Windsor . Mrs Powell, who was born into a farming family, attended the ceremony and reception but declined the royal invite for the evening’s entertainment, fearing she could be tired after a long day. She was nanny to the princes for 15 years, there at their sides as their parents divorced and to comfort them after their mother, Princess Diana, died in a car crash in Paris in 1997. Mrs Powell continued to be a part of their lives, attending Prince Harry’s confirmation at Eton College in 2000, and Prince WIlliam’s 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle, along with his passing out parade from Sandhurst in 2006. The Duke of Cambridge cancelled four scheduled appearances in the North East to attend today's service . Mrs Powell was rushed to Princes Alexandra Hospital, Harlow after collapsing near her home in Broxbourne on September 25 but she sadly died later the same day. A request was made ahead of today’s funeral for family flowers only, with donations to be made to Prince Harry’s own charity, Sentebale, which supports orphans and young children in Lesotho. Mrs Powell’s husband, Charles, passed away in 1952, after the couple had been married for six years. Popular and well-loved, Mrs Powell often gave talks to local WI groups about her role as a nanny in the royal household and was highly respected for refusing to disclose any family secrets after she retired.

Britain will bring home 4,000 troops from Afghanistan next year under plans to speed up the pace of British withdrawal. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond revealed the mass pullout, the first senior minister to put a concrete number on the scale of the drawdown. David Cameron has previously announced that British combat operations in Afghanistan will be over by the end of 2014. Mass pullout: British soldiers from B Company, 2 Mercian, board a Chinook helicopter on an operation in Malgir, Helmand province . But Mr Hammond said commanders have advised the government that Afghan forces will be able to cope if nearly half of the UK's 9,000-strong force in Helmand province pulls out next year. Initial plans would have seen the vast bulk of British troops withdraw in 2014, but commanders now consider that they can move faster in 2013. Army chiefs have also come under pressure from Chancellor George Osborne, who confronted commanders at a recent National Security Council meeting, demanding to know why they couldn't pull all British troops out of Afghanistan now. The Treasury is keen to save money to help reduce the deficit and operations in Afghanistan have already cost in excess of £17 billion on top of the core defence budget. Britain currently has 9,500 military personnel on the ground, a figure which will be cut to 9,000 by the end of this year. Mr Hammond said reductions next year would be dramatically bigger: 'Following my last visit to Afghanistan, I detect a change in mood among the senior ISAF commanders, that it will now be possible to have a significant reduction in force numbers by the end of next year, after the next fighting season. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond revealed the mass pullout, the first senior minister to put a concrete number on the scale of the drawdown . Welcome home: Lance Bombardier Scott Campbell with his son Taylor, aged four, as soldiers from 19th Regiment Royal Artillery (The Highland Gunners) are reunited with their families after returning from Afghanistan . 'That is because of the evidence, this year, that as the US has withdrawn its surge, the Afghans have in fact stepped up to the plate and taken over those positions. 'I would expect it to be significant. Which means thousands not hundreds but I would not expect it to be the majority of our forces.' Asked, by the BBC's Andrew Marr whether that meant around 4,000 troops would be brought back, Mr Hammond nodded and said: 'Something [like that]. 'By the beginning of 2013, we'll have 9,000 troops there and by the end of 2014 we'll have virtually none. I would expect there to be a significant step at the end of 2013.' The ability of the Afghan forces to take on the Taliban has been questioned as a result of a series of 'green on blue' incidents which have seen Taliban sympathisers infiltrate the local security forces and murder British soldiers. But Mr Hammond said the Afghan Army has shown that it will be able to contain the Taliban once British and American troops leave. 'In two of the three districts that we, the UK, are responsible for, in Nadi Ali and Lashkhar Gah, the Afghans are doing all the day-to day security work already. 'Transition is well advanced in those areas. 'Our forces are mainly in the main operating bases, going out occasionally to support them. But by and large the Afghans already, two years ahead are in control of security.' The Defence Secretary confirmed that the Chancellor questioned whether troops could be withdrawn now, but he said Mr Osborne was simply being provocative. 'The Chancellor's style is quite properly to challenge received wisdom,' he said. 'I think he was asking us to justify our current plan by putting it to us that there is an alternative, we could just come out now. And we take that challenge.' The National Security Council is expected to meet again in December to discuss options for the Afghan force, with a decision likely before February. Some 433 British service personnel have died in Afghanistan since the 2001 operation that toppled the Taliban.","David Cameron previously said operations will be over by the end of 2014 .

Package holidays are making a comeback with more families seeking value and financial security for when they travel abroad. Figures released by travel association ABTA show nearly half - 48 per cent - of Brits went on an overseas package deal in 2012. This is compared to 42 per cent in 2011 and 37 per cent in 2010. Figures show package holidays abroad are making a comeback as hard-pressed families seek value and financial security for their annual break in the sun . The figures emerged as it was revealed that hard-up Britons took fewer holidays in the last year, dropping from 3.82 in the 12 months to September 2011 to 3.5 holidays in the same period to September 2012. The 1970s were a heyday for package breaks as families jetted off to sunny destinations such as Spain but the arrival of the internet put an increasing dent in the market as holidaymakers went online to book their breaks. According to the Office for National Statistics, 56 per cent of European holidays in 2000 were packages which had dropped to 39 per cent by 2007. An ABTA spokesman said the figure in the 1970s was around the 60 per cent mark. The figures also showed that domestic holiday packages, such as coach tours and rail breaks, were on the up, increasing to 23 per cent in 2012 compared to 12 per cent in 2011 and 14 per cent in 2010. New figures released by travel association Abta showed 48 per cent of Brits booked a foreign package holiday this year, compared with 42 per cent in 2011 and 37 per cent in 2010 . In comparison to the findings, there has been a slight decrease in the number of people organising DIY holidays – where they book their travel and accommodation separately. A total of 39 per cent of those surveyed said they had booked a foreign trip themselves in 2012 which stood at 43 per cent in 2011. Victoria Bacon, head of communications for ABTA, said consumers valued the ‘security and cost effectiveness that package holidays provide’. She added: ‘At the same time the market has also evolved to offer greater choice to holidaymakers. It’s no longer just a week in Benidorm. ‘The market is now very sophisticated, with packages to cater for every taste and budget – whether you want two weeks all-inclusive in the sun, a cruise around Asia or an adventure holiday in South America.’ Ms Bacon also said holidaymakers had the choice of star ratings to tempt them, ‘plus an easy booking process and great value for money’. ABTA research showed that the number of people booking an overseas holiday through a high street travel agent rose marginally in 2012, with 27 per cent booking compared to 25 per cent in 2011.","Figures released by ABTA show Britons took fewer holidays in 2012 .

The debate has sparked a national and international debate. The New Yorker Magazine even suggested that American President Barack Obama could learn a thing or two from Ms Gillard in politics following the heated debate. Scroll down for video . Heated debate: Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard spent 15 minutes attacking the leader of the opposition Tony Abbott (pictured together in 2010) saying 'if he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia... he needs a mirror' Her stance comes after popular radio DJ Alan Jones announced on his show that women in power were 'destroying the joint', fuelling a national debate around the extent of sexism still apparent in the country. Ms Gillard targeted Mr Abbott during debate in parliament yesterday. She said: ‘I will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man. I will nota nd the government will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man. Not now, not ever. ‘If he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia, he doesn't need a motion in the House of Representatives. He needs a mirror.’ Ms Gillard's statements came as they debated a motion to sack Speaker of the House Peter Slipper after text messages referring to women in derogatory way were made public . The text messages from Mr Slipper were revealed during a court hearing last week when he defended himself against sexual harassment accusations brought by his former assistant, James Ashby. The messages shocked politicians, resulting in a bitter row in parliament over whether he should be removed from the Speaker’s seat. Attempts by Liberal MPs including Mr Abbott to have him sacked failed by just one vote but later Mr Slipper, choking back his emotions, told the parliament that he was standing down because ‘the importance of the Role of Speaker in the House of Representatives is far greater than my own role.’ During his motion to sack the speaker, Mr Abbott said that every day Ms Gillard supported Mr Slipper was ‘another day of shame for a government which should already have died of shame’. Ms Gillard highlighted statements made by Mr Abbott in the past including that he said that ‘abortion is the easy way out’ and ‘what housewives of Australia need to understand as they do the ironing’ during a debate on the carbon tax, which was recently introduced. She said: ‘I was offended too by the sexism, by the misogyny of the Leader of the Opposition catcalling across this table at me, as I sit here as prime minister, “If the prime minister wants to, politically speaking, make an honest woman of herself,” something that would never have been said to any man sitting in this chair. ‘I was offended when the leader of the opposition went outside in the front of Parliament and stood next to a sign that said ‘Ditch the Witch”.’ National debate: Popular radio DJ Alan Jones announced on his show that women in power were 'destroying the joint', fuelling a national debate around the extent of sexism still apparent in the country . New Yorker magazine wrote: ‘After his performance last week, supporters of President Obama, watching Gillard cut through the disingenuousness and feigned moral outrage of her opponent to call him out for his own personal prejudice, hypocrisy, and aversion to facts, might be wishing their man would take a lesson from Australia.’ A huge backlash to Radio presenter Mr Jones’ comments about women in high power positions, as well as remarks he made that Ms Gillard’s father (who died recently) ‘died of shame’ has led to a media campaign against him. Consumer backlash also led to sponsors dropping their advertisements from his breakfast show on radio station 2GB.

We all have to do it. But sometimes we forget, and sometimes we can't be bothered. But dental hygiene is one of the most important parts of the daily routine, and a new toothbrush tries to inject some fun to the twice-daily scrub, with a smartphone app that monitors your strokes and awards you gold stars for your ability to brush . The Beam toothbrush might be a boon to parents who are trying to get their children to brush, and it may inspire every owner to take more care of their pearls. But be warned, if you shun your teeth too much - the device could let your dentist know you have been bunking off. The device connects wirelessly to your phone, literally putting the 'tooth' into 'Bluetooth'. The reluctant brusher can then time their strokes and monitor their daily progress - although be warned that the toothbrush is not electric, so you still have to do the manual brushing yourself. The makers said: 'Today, the average person brushes their teeth for only 46 seconds, but is 50 per cent more likely to brush their teeth for a full two minutes by using just a simple timer. 'Oral care is considered patient-centered, since oral health is impacted significantly by your daily hygiene habits. 'Data from the Beam Brush is designed to raise awareness for your oral care.' Don't forget your smartphone! The brush will automatically tell your Android or Apple phone how you are doing . Set your goal and get brushing: The app can be set for different people as well as give you targets to reach . Beam CEO Alex Frommeyer told fastcoexist.com: 'The Beam toothbrush is the first app-connected toothbrush. 'Nothing about how you brush your teeth changes at all, but what we can do while you’re brushing your teeth does change.' The brush reacts to the body's own bio-electricity when it is placed in the mouth, starting the timer. The data is then sent to the user's phone, automatically updating the log and measuring their progress against 'brushing goals'. Then parents - or potentially dentists - can monitor the results, and help keep you on target with the brushing. The brush, which is taking pre-orders now, will be available in November for $50 - with a current pre-order discount of $34. The app - which will be available separately for users who just wish to use it as a timer - is due to be released for both Android and Apple devices in the coming weeks.","Beam toothbrush puts the 'tooth' in bluetooth by telling your smartphone how well you brush .

The birds were struck down by an avian version of the disease after being bitten by mosquitoes during the summer. Experts blamed the tragedy on wet and muggy weather that prompted an explosion of the insects in the capital. Scroll down for video . Deadly: Six Humboldt penguins at London Zoo, like these ones pictured swimming in its main enclosure, have died from avian malaria . However, they stressed there was no risk to the public as avian malaria cannot be passed to humans. The zoo remains open as usual. The penguins involved were all Humboldts, from Peru and Chile, although all breeds are equally susceptible to the disease. The penguins are likely to have become ill after a mosquito bit a native bird with the disease and then passed it on to them. It cannot be passed directly from bird to bird or to humans. 'Avian malaria is endemic in the UK’s wild bird population,' Rebecca Smith, a spokeswoman for the zoo said. Tragic: The birds, pictured at London Zoo last winter, have got a low resistance to the virus . 'A mosquito would have to bite one of these birds with the virus and then pass it on to a penguin. Each penguin must have been bitten individually - they cannot pass it to each other. Huge draw: The penguins are world famous, pictured here in 1937 with the Queen and Princess Margaret . 'It is very hard to spot physical symptoms before a penguin dies. They might suddenly go off their food or be lethargic but the process is not a long one. 'The zookeepers are feeding the penguins at breakfast with the medicine Primaquine which is also used to treat the disease in humans. 'The zoo treats its colony against avian-malaria as a matter of routine so it is unfortunate that these six penguins caught it. 'But the numbers of mosquitoes were very high this summer because the weather was very wet and muggy - just the conditions they thrive in. 'So the keepers and vets have decided to increase the penguins’ preventative anti-malarial medicine. 'There is absolutely no risk to the public because avian malaria is a completely different strain to the human varieties. 'We are keeping a close eye on all the other penguins to look for any sudden changes in their behaviour and at the moment they are all perfectly fit and healthy.' Zoo keepers have set up mosquito traps in the penguin enclosure and are spraying lavender oil - a mosquito repellant - in the nest boxes. They have also planted lavender which the birds use to build their nests.","The strain cannot be passed on to humans, experts say .

He added: 'The impact that he left will overshadow anything in his life.' Mr Woodward was released in 2008 after members of the non-profit Innocence Project re-examined his case. His conviction was set aside after DNA testing showed he didn't commit . the 1980 murder for which he had spent nearly three decades in prison - the longest time spent in jail for a prisoner before being exonerated.

But, despite her ordeal Ms Larke, 38, today admitted she may still have feelings for the long-haired presenter. When . asked whether she still loved Collins by Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones . on ITV's Daybreak, Ms Larke said: 'I think so, yes. I think so, I don’t . know. I'm so confused, my head is still kind of confused about it.' Ms Vandervlist also admits Collins was hard to walk away from. 'He had become a big part of my life . and he could quickly become the ""nice Justin’ again"", she said. 'But the nasty side . was getting worse.' Soon after they met on Myspace, the couple began exchanging flirty emails, despite Collins being married. Ms Vandervlist, an aspiring actress, said she had been drawn to the presenter who had seemed genuine, sincere and charming. They then met in person after Collins invited her to a recording of his show The Friday Night Project, which he hosted with Alan Carr. Ms Vandervlist said: 'He . felt like my best friend.

'The minute someone swore at me I'd be gone,' she said . They met again two weeks later in London and went with Mighty Boosh star Noel Fielding and Duncan James from boy band Blue, to a party. Later on he accused her of flirting with the pair. Ms Vandervlist said: 'He said to me, ""I bet you enjoyed that kiss from Noel and I . bet you fancied Duncan, I bet he is your type"".' 'He said one kiss at the end of a . message was for a friend, two for more and three for someone special. He . insisted on three. He was trying to control me.'Jo Vandervlist, 37 . She added that Collins then became 'obsessed' with comments from other men on her MySpace page and even analysed how long it took her to reply to a text message.

The minute someone swore at me I'd be gone."" 'But it was my dad who went to the police. I was reluctant to, but I spoke to them and they were amazing and I just thought there is no way I can let him get away with this because who’s he going to hurt next?' She added: 'I wanted to stop the cycle before it happens to anyone else, and also I want to with this to send out the message that emotional abuse can be more damaging than physical abuse because my bruises – external bruises fade but the bruises inside me they are still there, it’s really hard.' Collins was given a 140-hour community sentence and ordered him to pay £3,500 costs after the trial last week. On his sentence, Ms Larke said: 'I was pleased that he got convicted, but I was appalled at the sentence - community service for what he did.' Asked why she put up with the abuse, the PR said: 'I absolutely adored him, he was the love of my life, I absolutely loved him.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 10:34 EST, 15 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:38 EST, 15 October 2012 . Is there any escape from all those political ads in the most hotly contested states in the three weeks before the presidential election? The TV ads come in rapid succession and at all hours — in the middle of newscasts, soap operas and talk shows. They cover everything from jobs to education to trust, and they're sharply negative. It's all enough to turn off voters, leaving them frustrated and annoyed. Hoping for the vote: Mitt Romney and Barack Obama have raised millions- both personally and via political action committees- to spend on television ads throughout the presidential campaign . 'It's just way too much,' says Scot French, a history professor at the University of Central Florida. He lives along the swing-voting Interstate 4 corridor that will play an important role in deciding whether President Barack Obama or Mitt Romney wins the state, and perhaps the White House. Mr French is quick to criticize both political parties, calling the homestretch advertising deluge 'a game of sowing confusion among those who are confusable.' This is the risk facing the candidates and their allies as they spend huge sums of money before the November 6 vote. It's a risk that both sides are willing to take, given that polls show the race remains close nationally and in the most competitive states such as Florida. By the end, the campaigns and independent groups will have spent about $1.1billion on television advertising this year, with $750million already allocated in the handful of states likely to determine the outcome of the contest — Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin, the Kantar-Campaign Media Analysis Group estimates. Florida tops the list, with more than $150million spent by both sides so far. Personal appeals: The President spent the weekend in Virginia while preparing for Tuesday's debate, and stopped in a field office to answer phones with a volunteer . At least some voters tuned out long ago: in interviews last week, many cited the negativity and lack of specifics in the commercials; others said they had already decided which candidate to support and didn't need to be persuaded. Indeed, many of the commercials at this late stage are aimed at those voters who have not yet locked in on their selection. The target audience includes people such as Felicity Rusnak, a stay-at-home mom from Orlando. But Ms Rusnak, 40, says she pays no attention to the ads and will rely on other sources of information to make up her mind. 'The ads I just find entertaining. The debates and what I read about are going to affect my decision. I need to know where the candidates stand,’ she said. There's no doubt that TV advertising has the power to shift voter perceptions, particularly when a candidate is not well known. Swing states: Mitt Romney has spent much time in Ohio, which is repeating its frequent role as a pivotal swing state . Romney prevailed in the Republican primaries after he and his allies buried his two main rivals with negative advertising in early voting states. Obama's team tagged Romney as a ruthless corporate raider with a flood of negative advertising in the early stages of the general election. The ads may have shaped perceptions in states such as Ohio, where Obama has held a narrow lead in polling for weeks. Even so, the unprecedented level of spending this year on ads hasn't changed many minds, according to one analyst. 'There's not much bang for the buck,' says John Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University who studies presidential campaign advertising. 'The public is pretty much set on who they will vote for and only a tiny slice is up for grabs.' That was the finding of his YouGov Ad Rating project, which screens political commercials with representative sample of 600 voters, including an oversample of 200 swing voters, who judge them for their fairness, believability and emotional reactions. Few ads, he said, really 'move the dials.' Not that the candidates and their backers aren't trying their best to do just that. In the final weeks, Obama's team is running an ad warning that Romney would cut Medicaid money for nursing home care. 'We have a president who won't let that happen,' the ad says. Romney primarily is running a spot in which he promises to boost the economy through manufacturing, energy and cracking down on China. 'Let me tell you how I will create 12 million jobs when President Obama couldn't,' Romney says. Risky: By bombarding voters with campaign ads, the candidates run the risk of creating a negative feeling and prompting them to avoid voting all together . Both sides are being buffeted by independent groups. Romney is getting a big assist from two super political action committees, Restore Our Future and American Crossroads. The pro-Obama Priorities USA Action is running an ad saying Romney would cut early childhood education if elected. Among those who aren't watching is Paul Gentille, a 67-year-old Obama supporter from St. Petersburg. He said he tuned out the ads months ago. 'Everyone I know has already made up their mind. The ads are kind of annoying,' he said. 'It's a shame to see so much money being spent.' On the other side is Julie Harris, also of St. Petersburg. The 33-year-old stay-at-home mom said she always planned to support Romney and that his ads made her 'more enthusiastic' about doing so. One particular Obama ad stuck out to her: the ad assailing Romney's pledge to end federal support of public television and the Sesame Street character Big Bird. Even though she's a fan of public TV, she says that ad won't affect her vote.","Campaigns will have spent $1.1billion by end of election on November 6 .

The beard is greyer, and the hook is absent – but there’s no mistaking whose mugshot it is. Abu Hamza, who has finally been extradited from Britain after an eight-year legal battle, posed for a first photograph on American soil after arriving at his new prison. The 54-year-old, whose hands were blown off by a bomb, has already complained about his hook being confiscated. Guards deemed it a security risk. Staring ahead: Radical Islamic Abu Hamza al-Masri poses for this mugshot following his extradition from Britain to the U.S. Hamza, who also lost his left eye, added that he is not being treated in a ‘civilised’ manner. The fanatic is said to be in solitary . confinement for 23 hours a day at the Metropolitan Correctional  Centre . in New York, with rules banning him from speaking to other inmates. The preacher has pleaded not guilty . to facilitating violent jihad in Afghanistan and trying to set up a . terrorist training camp in Oregon. He also denies involvement in the 1998 kidnapping of Western tourists in Yemen. Three Britons and an Australian were killed. Four others who were extradited along . with him denied their charges as well. Hamza, who appeared at a brief . hearing in Manhattan last week, will return to court on October 26. His trial has been provisionally scheduled for next August. Preaching: Abu Hamza speaks during what was his regular Friday prayer meeting outside Finsbury Park Mosque, north London, on 14 May, 2004, shortly before he was arrested . The prison: Hamza, who is being held in the top security Manhattan Metropolitan Correction Centre in New York city (pictured), is having to eat all his food through a straw . Last week it emerged that his wife . Najat Mostafa could make £75,000 by exercising her right to buy her . £1million council house in Shepherd’s Bush, West London. She has ignored requests to downsize to a smaller property. During his initial court appearance his lawyer Sabrina Shroff asked a judge to return the metal hooks - but was turned down. Hamza is having to eat all his food . through a straw. According to prison sources Hamza will be given a pair of cable operated rubber hands. New York based prosthetic maker Arimed said the hands would be custom made for Hamza. Non electric prosthetics costs between $5,000 and $8,000 each, while high spec models featuring sensors can cost up to $55,000. Jeremy Schneider, his lawyer, and Abu Hamza, who pleaded not guilty to terror charges in a New York court earlier this month . Caged: While he waits to go on trial - which could take anywhere from nine months to two years - Hamza will remain in a bleak New York jail . Hamza, who faces months in jail . before being put on trial, will be given the cheaper option, according . to law enforcement sources. 'We have people on contract. We'd have someone come in a do it,' said a law enforcement source. 'The rule is you give the guy what they had before. Not anything better.' Hamza lost his hands after mine exploded while he was fighting the Soviet army in Afghanistan. He . was extradited to the US after an eight year legal battle on terrorism . charged stemming from attempting to open a terror camp in Oregon and . assisting in the kidnapping of 16 tourists, including two Americans, in . Yemen. Earlier this month the 54-year-old . pleaded not guilty to facilitating violent jihad in Afghanistan and . trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Oregon. Abu Hamza was arrested at his London home in May 2004. Ironically, he was processed using 'fast track' rules which were introduced at the start of 2004 in a bid to avoid lengthy legal wrangles when extraditing to the U.S. Previously, it took around a year for extradition to go ahead. But it would be EIGHT YEARS and five months before Hamza set foot on American soil. By removing the need for presentation of a prima facie case it brought procedures between the UK and U.S. more in line with extradition arrangements to European countries. But, even then, Hamza had two opportunities to appeal - and when those failed his lawyers used every excuse they could to further delay his removal from the UK for years. The then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, boasted about the new system: 'It will mean much closer co-operation and cut out much of the paperwork which has led to unnecessary delays in the current system and allowed criminals to exploit loopholes and deliberately thwart justice.' He . also denied involvement in the 1998 kidnapping in Yemen of Western . tourists in which three Britons and an Australian were killed. Hamza . appeared at Manhattan’s Federal Court wearing a navy blue jumpsuit with . a brown T-shirt underneath, the standard garb of a high security . prisoner at the ‘Supermax’ jail where he is being held. He was not wearing his hooks leaving the stumps clear for the public to see and spoke only once during the 30-minute hearing. The scale of the investigation was also made clear by prosecutor John Cronan who revealed that the US District Attorney has 8,500 documents, four hard drives and 24 DVDs of evidence against Hamza. Some of the evidence to be used in the trial may also come from British authorities, although Mr Cronan did not elaborate further. Hamza’s laywer Jeremy Schneider said after the hearing that his client was having a ‘hard time’ in the grim Metropolitan Corrections Centre. He added that as far as he understood . it prison guards had been giving Hamza his hooks back for part of the . day but not permanently. Hamza was one of five people extradited to the US from Britain to face terrorism charges. Adel . Abdel Bary, 52, Khaled al-Fawwaz, 50, Syed Talha Ahsan, 33, and Babar . Ahmad, 36, have all plead not guilty to the charges against them. Hamza will next appear before the court on October 26.

Her interjection drew applause from the audience, led by Mrs Obama, but angered political commentators, who accused Crowley of stepping in on behalf of the President. The Stevens memorial service began with the National Anthem sung by members of the University of California Men's Glee Club, and speakers included retired U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering, who heads a State Department panel investigating the attacks that killed Stevens and his three colleagues. Pickering recalled that when then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's security forces were trailing Stevens, he stole their camera and started photographing them. 'They were so dumbfounded they had to laugh,' he said. Friends described Stevens as humble and always interested in others. Stevens' sister, Dr Anne Stevens Sullivan, said he made friends everywhere, even in elevators, where he would strike up a conversation in French. Also fluent in Arabic, Stevens served as deputy ambassador to Libya from 2007 to 2009.

Putting politics aside: Political leaders like Sen Dianne Feinstein were among attendees during the memorial service . In April 2011, he became a special envoy to Libya and traveled aboard a Greek cargo ship to Benghazi, where he set up a diplomatic outpost in support of the rebel opposition. In August 2011, rebel forces backed by NATO power ousted Gaddafi. He was captured and killed two months later. In May, Clinton rewarded Stevens' work in Libya by swearing him in as U.S. ambassador. Family members said Stevens' ashes would be interred near his grandfather and other relatives in his birthplace of Grass Valley, California.","Solemn service in San Francisco attended by former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, Rep Barbara Lee and Sen Dianne Feinstein .

A former cub scout who was molested as a nine-year-old by Jimmy Savile has said he blamed himself for the 36 years that he kept it a secret. Kevin Cook, now 45, appeared on Jim'll Fix It with the TV star in 1976 after members of his cub pack wrote in to the show. Mr Cook, the presenter's youngest alleged victim, said he was lured to a dressing room with the promise of receiving a coveted badge for appearing on the programme. Scroll down for video .

But while in the room, Savile asked him whether he was ready to 'earn your badge' before molesting him then getting him to touch him through his trousers. He originally spoke out about the ordeal on Sunday after telling his wife about the abuse - the first person he had ever told - last Thursday. Speaking today, he said he was motivated by the courage of others who have come forward in the wake of the scandal. He told This Morning: 'All these years I have had it with me I thought I was the only one. I blamed myself for what had happened.' Mr Cook appeared on the show with members of the 44th Newham East cub pack. Savile touches the nine-year-old boy's face as he ties a red ribbon around them moments before he undid Kevin's trousers .

After filming for the show, the married father-of-two said he was on stage with the others cubs when Savile approached him to thank him for giving him a tie which his mother had passed on as a present. 'We were all on the stage. That's when Jimmy came up to me and thanked me for the tie and asked me if I would like my own badge, which of course I agreed to', he said. Mr Cook was led off down a corridor in to a 'dingy' dressing room where Savile pulled out a chair, asked him to sit down and then touched him. At one point he said a man walked in to the room, saw what was happening, said 'Oops', and then closed the door shut. He said: 'After I’d done my shorts up Jimmy warned me not to tell anyone. He said “Don’t even tell your mates. We know where you live. Nobody would believe you anyway – I’m King Jimmy”.’ Mr Cook, who now lives in an Essex coastal town said the threat had always haunted him. Mr Cook, now a married father, is pictured circled, on the show back in 1976 . He added: 'The threat was always there and when you finally read and you hear about it and there's other people, it makes it easier to tell.' When asked if he regretted not speaking about it before, he said: 'I wish (I had). That's the regret because obviously he's passed away and nothing can be done. 'But I wish I came forward years ago.' He said he was close to telling his cub leader a few months after the incident in the 70s but in the end decided not to. Asked how he felt about Savile now, he responded: 'I hate the man, nothing but anger towards him, and bitter that he died and he can't face the music. 'But I also think that all the work that he's done, all the charity work, i just think that was a sham and the disguise to hide what he's been up to and he's got away with it.' He said 'I feel a different person now' after telling his family and police about the sexual abuse. Meanwhile another photograph emerged today of Savile nearby a Jersey care home where 192 youngsters allegedly suffered abuse. The star is pictured grinning as he holds on tightly to two youngsters to take them for a private walk. Television presenter and ChildLine . founder Esther Rantzen denied again today that she ignored allegations . about Savile from an anti-child abuse campaigner. Ms Rantzen, who fronted the BBC . programme That's Life, told This Morning that she had only ever heard . 'rumours' about Savile, whose alleged crimes were revealed in an ITV . documentary. She said: 'As Ian Hislop said so . brilliantly last week, knowledge means that you hear from the person it . happened to or a witness and that’s what the ITV documentary showed me. 'Up until then, I’ve heard rumours . about the royal family, politicians, about TV presenters and my view . about rumours is the vast majority of the rumours are untrue. So I . didn’t know anything.' Ms Rantzen said she had 'no memory' of being contacted by campaigner Shy Keenan who said she told her about Savile. The presenter added: 'Now the lady . who says that she told me 18 years ago - I’ve gone back through the . records of that year to see if we ever did an item about child abuse in . that series of That’s Life...she says she met me then. 'I have no memory of her at all. And . we did one item about child abuse in that series and it was about . criminal compensation...the other members of That’s Life staff have no . memory of her.' Jimmy Savile is captured for the first time in the room of his flat at Stoke Mandeville hospital where it is alleged he took nurses before and after he abused patients on the wards. He began volunteering as a porter there . in the 1970s and had free use of a flat on site while he helped to raise . £40 million for its spinal injuries centre. A former patient at the hospital, Rebecca Owen, had previously told of how nurses at the hospital knew about his behaviour and were apprehensive about his visits. Savile is pictured getting dressed in his Stoke Mandeville Hospital flat, in July 1982 . Ms Owen said she heard a conversation between nurses. 'It was an air of resignation that you had to put up with,' she said. 'There was some sort of ironic chatter between the nurses about who would be the lucky one to go off to his room.

Germany's demands for a ‘budget tsar’ to oversee tax and spending across the eurozone caused uproar yesterday. Chancellor Angela Merkel said Brussels should have greater control over national budgets – including the right to send them back for changes. But the call – made in a speech in Berlin just hours before last night’s European Union summit – sparked outrage across Europe. Lead balloon: Chancellor Merkel gives a speech in Berlin just hours before last . night's European Union summit in which she called for the introduction . of a 'budget tsar' to oversee tax and spending across the eurozone . Many governments fiercely oppose handing control of their national finances to unelected bureaucrats in a foreign capital. Mrs Merkel’s demand came as more than 70,000 anti-austerity protesters took to the streets of Athens as part of a general strike. Petrol bombs, bottles and chunks of marble were thrown at Greek police. Officers responded with volleys of tear gas and stun grenades. One 65-year-old demonstrator later died of a heart attack. A woman apart: EU leaders (Front row L-R) European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, French President Francois Hollande, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and Greek PM Antonis Samaras.

In London, Treasury officials said . the German proposals only related to the 17 eurozone countries and would . not include the UK. ‘We have made it very clear that this is something . we are not going to do,’ said a source. In . an address to Germany’s parliament, the Bundestag, Mrs Merkel endorsed a . proposal for the EU’s monetary affairs commissioner to become an . enforcer of the bloc’s budget rules. Germany hopes that having a budget tsar will stop governments overspending and protect Europe against further bailouts. Riots: Police in Athens yesterday were pelted with petrol bombs . ‘We are of the opinion – and I speak . for the whole of the German government on this – that we could go a step . further by giving Europe real rights of intervention in national . budgets,’ said Mrs Merkel. She added that she was ‘astonished’ by the Europe-wide opposition to the proposal and insisted that Germany was not ‘isolated’. French President Francois Hollande insisted the creation of a budget tsar was not up for discussion at the Brussels meeting – the 22nd summit since the start of the eurozone debt crisis three years ago. In a stinging rebuke to Mrs Merkel, he said: ‘The only decision that we have to take, to confirm, is putting in place a banking union by the end of the year. The first step is a banking supervisor.’ Mr Hollande – France’s first . socialist president since the 1980s – wants a new banking supervisor put . in place as soon as possible to help support struggling lenders across . the eurozone. But European . officials are struggling to thrash out the details, meaning few concrete . decisions are expected to emerge from the latest meeting of the EU’s 27 . leaders. Mrs Merkel insisted that ‘quality must come before speed’ in setting up the banking supervisor. ‘There . are a lot of very complicated legal questions, and I am not making the . issue more difficult than it actually is,’ she said. ‘No major decisions are likely at the summit.’ Mrs Merkel has a far thornier relationship with Mr Hollande than she did with his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy. Berlin . and Paris now no longer agree a united position before summits and . strong-arm the rest of Europe into going along with their plans. With . unemployment skyrocketing and growth grinding to a halt across the . continent, the back-and-forth is beginning to frustrate some European . officials. Jose Manuel . Barroso, who is president of the EU’s executive arm, the European . Commission, criticised the heel-dragging ahead of the meeting. ‘There is not all over Europe the same sense of urgency,’ he said. Meanwhile: Athens police are used to dealing with rioters in the last year. Today, . once again, the protests have turned violent with masked anarchists . fighting police . A molotov cocktail explodes after being thrown at riot police. Today's strike in Athens has closed down public services and severely hampered most forms of transport . Pressure is mounting on Spain to request a bailout – something the government in Madrid is reluctant to do. ‘It would be helpful if Spain asked for aid,’ said Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council. ‘But it is up to Spain to make up its mind.’ Yesterday’s general strike in Greece grounded flights, shut down public services and closed schools, hospitals and shops. A three-hour stoppage by air traffic controllers led to flight cancellations for thousands of holidaymakers. Islands were also cut off as ferries stayed in ports.","German Chancellor said Brussels should have greater control over national budgets .

Doctors are to face compulsory checks on their medical skills to ensure they are not putting patients in danger. From December, all GPs and hospital medics will have to start submitting dossiers of evidence proving their competence. If they are not deemed to be up to scratch, they could be referred to the General Medical Council and even struck-off. MoTs: Doctors will now have compulsory checks to make sure their medical skills are up to scratch . The checks were partly triggered by the inquiry into Harold Shipman, the Manchester GP who murdered up to 250 patients between 1972 and 1998. They were meant to be rolled-out several years ago but have been repeatedly delayed because the system wasn’t deemed ready. Presently doctors can go through their entire 40-year career without ever having to prove they are still competent and there are concerns patients may be at risk. Under the new system doctors will face such checks every five years. They will have to submit a file proving their medical skills to one of the chief doctors at the hospital or NHS organisation where they work - known as the ‘responsible officer’. Serial killer: The change was brought about by the inquiry into Dr Harold Shipman who murdered up to 250 of his patients in 26 years . This will include feedback from their colleagues, comments from patients and a list of courses they have attended to keep skills up to date. Doctors will either be passed, be told to go away and carry out more training or failed -which is officially termed ‘not to be engaging.’ Such doctors would then be referred to the General Medical Council and possibly struck-off - although this only expected to happen on rare occasions. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘We want to have the best survival rates in Europe for the major killer diseases. ‘Doctors save lives every day and making sure they are up to speed with the latest treatments and technologies will help them save even more. This is why a proper system of revalidation is so important.’ The checks were in-part prompted by the scandal at the Bristol Royal Infirmary hospital, where up to a 100 babies died following heart surgery. Doctors at the unit were accused of being ‘closed, secretive and defensive.’ Then in 2004, the inquiry into Harold Shipman called for doctors to face regular checks - it said the General Medical Council was not doing enough to protect patients.Professor Sir Peter Rubin, chair of the GMC said: ‘This is an historic day for patients and for the medical profession. We are confident that the introduction of revalidation will make a major contribution to the quality of care that patients receive and will give them valuable assurance that the doctors who treat them are regularly assessed against our professional standards.’ The health secretary also announced plans for a national list of GPs and dentists to root-out poor performers. 'Raising standards': Health secretary Jeremy Hunt said a proper system of revalidation is important to improve survival rates . At present there are only local registers meaning that if a doctor receives a high number of complaints in one area - and is removed from the list - they can just move to another and start afresh. But the British Medical Association warned that the checks may just lead to even more bureaucracy in the NHS. Dr Mark Porter, chair of the BMA’s Council said: ‘It is important to recognise, that while revalidation will undoubtedly enhance the rigorous testing that doctors undergo, clinicians are already offering patients a very high quality service and robust systems are currently in place to deal with any concerns. ‘There is too much bureaucracy in the NHS and so we have to be careful that revalidation does not add to this unnecessarily.’","New rule triggered by the inquiry into Harold Shipman - the Manchester GP who murdered up to 250 patients between 1972 and 1998 .

It's not a coincidence that fiery former footballer Roy Keane is rarely to be seen without a sizeable dog or two - or that former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell favours much smaller, fluffier dogs. Researchers from the University of Leicester asked 235 adults which were their favourite dog breeds and asked them to fill out a test which assessed their personality.

The study concluded that your dog is actually an extension of who you are - and that your choice of dog can reflect your personality in rather surprising ways. The dogs were the 10 most popular breeds in the UK including Labrador retriever, English cocker spaniel, West Highland white terrier, border terrier, German shepherd, boxer and Staffordshire bull terrier. The canines were then rated according to how aggressive they are with terriers the most aggressive and cocker spaniels the least. The results showed that those people who are less likely to be concerned with the welfare of others, were more competitive and less friendly tended to like aggressive dogs. Younger people tended to go for more aggressive dogs too. In a surprising twist, conscientious people were also more likely to go for more fearsome pet. Psychologist Vincent Egan, the lead author of the study, told LiveScience: ‘I think that given a choice, people select things they like. Choosing to have an aggressive dog is due to the person making the choice; the dog is not foisted on you. ‘If a dog is selected as a symbol of intimidation and a possible weapon, it is not being selected as a companion, or a playmate.’ He added: ‘This type of study is important, as it shows assumptions are not the whole picture. ‘It is assumed owners of aggressive dogs, or dogs perceived as aggressive, are antisocial show-offs.’ A previous study from the University of Bath showed that people really do look like their dogs - because we are drawn to pets with similar physical attributes.","Argumentative people go for aggressive dogs .

Dodd photographed in the 1860s is seen of the Arkansas Civil War hero executed as a 17-year-old Confederate spy . The story of David O. Dodd is relatively unknown outside of Arkansas, but the teenage spy who chose to hang rather than betray the Confederate cause is a folk hero to many in his home state. Street signs and an elementary in the state capital have long borne Dodd's name, and admirers gather at his grave each year to pay tribute to Dodd's life and death. 'Everyone wants to remember everything else about the Civil War that was bad,' said one of them, W. Danny Honnoll. 'We want to remember a man that stood for what he believed in and would not tell on his friends.' A state commission's decision, though, to grant approval for yet another tribute to Dodd has revived an age-old question: Should states still look for ways to commemorate historical figures who fought to defend unjust institutions? '(Dodd) already has a school. I don't know why anything else would have to be done to honor him,' James Lucas Sr., a school bus driver, said near the state Capitol in downtown Little Rock. Arkansas' complicated history of race relations plays out on the Capitol grounds. A stone and metal monument that's stood for over a century pays tribute to the Arkansas men and boys who fought for the Confederacy and the right to own slaves. Not far away, nine bronze statues honour the black children who, in 1957, needed an Army escort to enter what had been an all-white school. Captured: A monument to Dodd marks where he was captured by the Yankees before his hanging in 1863 where an elementary school named for him now rests . The newest nod to Dodd would mark a site across town where he was detained after Union soldiers found encoded notes on him about their troop locations. Dodd was convicted of spying and sentenced to death, and legend has it he refused an offer to walk free in exchange for the name of the person who gave him the information. 'He was barely 17 years old when the Yankees hung him' on Jan. 8, 1864, Honnoll said. 'Yeah, he was spying, but there (were) other people that spied that they didn't hang.' Dodd is certainly not the only teenager to die in the war or even the lone young martyr, said Carl Moneyhon, a University of Arkansas at Little Rock history professor. 'If you start talking about the 16-, 17- and 18-year-olds who were killed in battle, the number is infinite,' Moneyhon said. 'There are tens of thousands of them. They become unremarkable.' So it seems all the more curious that some have come to portray Dodd as Arkansas' boy martyr. Captured: This building known as 10-Mile-House shows where Dodd was detained after captured by Union troops in 1863 and executed in 1864 for being a Confederate spy . 'It's part of the romanticizing of the Civil War that began in the 1880s and the 1890s, that looks for ... what could be called heroic behaviour to celebrate in a war filled with real horrors,' Moneyhon said. And it's caught on, though many question why. Remembered: A metal and a stone monument mark the grave of Dodd who is still visited by admirers each year . 'It's a very sad story, but at the end of the day, Dodd was spying for the Confederacy, which was fighting a war to defend the institution of slavery,' said Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center. Sharon Donovan — who lives on West David O. Dodd Road (there's an East David O. Dodd Road, too) — said she wouldn't mind another Dodd namesake in her neighbourhood. 'The fact that we live in the South, I could understand why he would want to do it because he was actually working for us in a way. ... For that era, I think it was probably a noble thing to do,' Donovan said. About a half-mile away, a banner outside an elementary school proclaims, 'David O. Dodd Committed to Excellence.' A doormat bearing Dodd's name shows a black boy smiling next to a few white ones. About half of the school's 298 students last year were black and only 27 were white. Jerry Hooker, who graduated from Central High School years after the desegregation standoff over the Little Rock Nine, lives at the site where he says Dodd was detained almost a century and a half ago. The Arkansas Civil War Sesquicentennial Commission approved his application and agreed to chip in $1,000 for the marker noting the spot's historical significance. Hooker, 59, said the move to commemorate Dodd is not about honouring slavery, but about remembering the past. 'I don't think it has a thing to do with race whatsoever,' Hooker said. 'He was a 17-year-old kid with a coded message in his boot that had enough of whatever it is in him that he didn't squeal on his sources.' Still, in a city that stripped 'Confederate Blvd.' from its interstate highway signs shortly before dignitaries arrived in town for the opening of Bill Clinton's presidential library, the question remains: Should Dodd's name be etched into another piece of stone or metal for posterity's sake? 'There are currently more monuments to David O. Dodd than any other war hero in Arkansas,' Potok said. 'You would think that at some point it would be enough.'",David O.

Apple lost a Court of Appeal battle today in its legal action over Samsung’s Galaxy tablet computer. The American electronics giant argued that the Samsung Galaxy Tab was too similar to its own product. But a judge at the High Court in London ruled in July that the Galaxy tablet was not 'cool' enough to be confused with Apple’s iPad - a decision Apple challenged at the Court of Appeal. Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet: A ruling claiming consumers were unlikely to confuse it with an iPad was upheld today. Apple has now lost a series of . lawsuits against Samsung based on the design of their tablets in the . Netherlands, Australia and US - despite sometimes winning temporary . sales bans. However, the California-based company has been more successful with other claims. A . US jury recently proposed Samsung should pay Apple a $1.05bn (£650m) fine for infringing several software patents, and the look and feel of . the iPhone - although Samsung is appealing the verdict. But the appeal was dismissed today by Lord Justice Longmore, Lord Justice Kitchin and Sir Robin Jacob. They upheld the decision of Judge Colin Birss QC that three Samsung Galaxy tablet computers did not infringe Apple’s registered design. Judge Birss said earlier this year: 'They do not have the same understated and extreme simplicity which is possessed by the Apple design. 'They are not as cool.' He said consumers were not likely to get the two tablet computers mixed up. The judge said: 'The informed user’s overall impression of each of the Samsung Galaxy tablets is the following: from the front they belong to the family which includes the Apple design; but the Samsung products are very thin, almost insubstantial members of that family with unusual details on the back. 'The overall impression produced is different.' Apple had argued that the front face and overall shape were the most important factors because the informed user would spend the most time looking at the front and holding it. It is believed Apple must now go ahead with Judge Birss' original command to publish a notice on its own website for six months and take out adverts in various major magazines and newspapers proclaiming that Samsung did not infringe its rights . In today’s ruling, Sir Robin said: 'Because this case (and parallel cases in other countries) has generated much publicity, it will avoid confusion to say what this case is about and not about. 'It is not about whether Samsung copied Apple’s iPad. 'Infringement of a registered design does not involve any question of whether there was copying: the issue is simply whether the accused design is too close to the registered design according to the tests laid down in the law.' He added: 'So this case is all about, and only about, Apple’s registered design and the Samsung products.' Apple CEO Tim Cook is still involved in several legal battles around the world with Samsung. Samsung said in a statement: 'We welcome the court’s judgment, which reaffirmed our position that our Galaxy Tab products do not infringe Apple’s registered design right. 'We continue to believe that Apple was not the first to design a tablet with a rectangular shape and rounded corners and that the origins of Apple’s registered design features can be found in numerous examples of prior art. 'Should Apple continue to make excessive legal claims in other countries based on such generic designs, innovation in the industry could be harmed and consumer choice unduly limited.' The three Court of Appeal judges also rejected Apple’s challenge against an order made by Judge Birss that it must publicise the fact that it had lost the case. Sir Robin said: 'The grant of such an order is not to punish the party concerned for its behaviour. Nor is it to make it grovel - simply to lose face. 'The test is whether there is a need to dispel commercial uncertainty.' Ruling that an order was necessary, Sir Robin said Apple must make the position clear 'that it acknowledges that the court has decided that these Samsung products do not infringe its registered design. 'The acknowledgment must come from the horse’s mouth. 'Nothing short of that will be sure to do the job completely.'","Ruling upholds July decision that consumers will not confuse the two tablets .

Customer concerns over mid-contract price hikes imposed by phone and broadband companies are to be investigated by the telecoms watchdog. Ofcom is to consult on how to protect consumers after a review conducted earlier this year raised the alarm over the practice, which according to consumer group Which? has hit 10 million customers. Several companies have increased prices for contract customers this year, including Vodafone, which revealed line rental on fixed contracts would increase £1.55 a month from November. Customer concerns over mid-contract price hikes imposed by phone and broadband companies are to be investigated by the telecoms watchdog. Three, T-Mobile and Orange have already done so, Which? said. Meanwhile, the full rollout of 4G moved a step closer after it emerged Vodafone, Three, O2 owner Telefonica and Orange and T-Mobile parent EE do not intend to bring a legal challenge against Ofcom over its 4G auction process. In response to Ofcom’s plans to consult on how to protect consumers from unexpected price increases within ‘fixed’ phone contracts, Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'We hope that Ofcom will now act swiftly to ensure that the mobile phone companies are made to drop hidden clauses in their contracts that allow them to hit consumers with millions of pounds’ worth of unexpected price increases.' The consultation, which Ofcom aims to publish by the end of the year, will consider whether price variation terms in fixed-term contracts are appropriate and will look at related issues including information provided to consumers at the point of sale. During the course of its review earlier this year, Ofcom examined 1,644 consumer complaints made to the regulator about changes to terms and conditions during the period September 2011 to May 2012, alongside further evidence provided by Which?. Many consumers complained they were not made aware of the potential for price rises in what they believed to be fixed contracts, Ofcom said. Consumers felt that communications providers should not be able to impose price increases during the life of a contract, Ofcom added, and the consumer should be able to exit the contract without penalty if they do. London Mayor Boris Johnson speaks at the launch of EE, Britain's first 4G network which launches later this month. Today rival operators said they had set up a new firm to speed up the introduction of rival 4G Networks . Claudio Pollack, Ofcom consumer group director, said: 'Ofcom understands the frustration that consumers feel when faced with price rises in what they assume to be a fixed contract with a fixed price. 'Having considered the large number of consumer complaints, we will soon consult on ways to address consumer concerns and ensure they are being treated fairly in this area.' The announcement came as EE, Telefonica O2, Three and Vodafone announced they have made further progress in speeding up the rollout of superfast 4G services. O2, Three and Vodafone threatened legal action when Ofcom gave the go-ahead for EE to launch its 4G services later this month. Following discussions with Ofcom and ministers, the four mobile phone companies have confirmed they will not take any legal action. The companies also formally created a jointly controlled company required to ensure the rollout of the services next year. The four operators formed Digital Mobile Spectrum, originally called MitCo, which will be responsible for ensuring that consumers continue to receive clear Freeview TV signals following the rollout of 4G services using the same spectrum. Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Maria Miller said: 'The rollout of 4G is a huge step forward for mobile broadband services in the UK, and will be incredibly important in driving economic growth.'","Major investigation to look at customer complaints over mid contract price hikes .

Orlando police have released transcripts of a 911 call made by a furious restaurant manager who found two patrons having sex on the patio in front of horrified parents and children. Shocked diners lost their appetite when Jeremie Calo and his pretty brunette date Tiffani Barganier, began having sex on a table outside and refused to stop when ordered to by manager, Tom Murphy. Mr Murphy called the authorities and described Calo's behaviour as 'intoxicated and combative,' before revealing that the man had also vomited all over the ground. Raunchy: Police have released the 911 tape of the call made by a furious restaurant manager after he allegedly found Jeremie Calo (left) and Tiffani Barganier (right) having sex on a patio table in front of families with kids . According to police he told the . couple: 'Compose yourself, pay your tab or I'll call the police.' But outrageous Jeremie Calo claimed his date could not stop as 'she can't get up at this time,' prompting the Baldwin Park restaurant manager to make the call. He told the operator on duty: 'We . had a patron having sex on the patio and we warned him and told him he . can't do that. There's kids down the way and patrons complaining. He's . intoxicated.' As the operator tried to clarify what was happening he asked: 'So the subject was having sex with a girl and then he tried to run off with some beers?' Lucky: Manager Tom Murphy called police to the incident where Calo was arrested for fighting with the restaurateur and not paying his bill but the couple avoided being taken in for having sex in public . Another employee took the phone and told him: 'Yeah, well they have a tab here and they were looking to run out on the tab.' Shortly after, as they waited for a patrol car to show up, the manager revealed that Calo's behaviour had become more violent. 'He's s***faced now and he's being combative,' he said adding to Calo, 'don't touch me.' When police finally arrived and cuffed Calo for trying to run out on his bar tab, Mr Murphy informed the operator still on the line: 'Now he's throwing up.'

Changing attitudes: Puerto Rican featherweight Orlando Cruz wants to fight homophobia outside the ring . The first professional boxer to come out as gay has spoken of his lifelong battle to accept his sexuality. In a searing interview ahead of a fight tonight, Orlando Cruz revealed he had had seen a psychiatrist for years before he made the announcement earlier this month. And the 31-year-old spoke of his fury at how the gay community in his native Puerto Rico   were persecuted and ostracised for their sexuality. Pazos, a featherweight who goes head-to-head with Jorge Pazos in Florida tonight, described how he had spent 12 years coming to terms with who he was. 'I decided to be free,’ he told The Guardian. ‘They can call me ""maricon"" or ""faggot"" and I don't care. Let them say it because they can't hurt me now. ‘I have done well as a boxer but, all this time, I have been living with this thorn inside me. I wanted to take it out of me so I could have peace with myself.’ Cruz, who is currently ranked fourth by the World Boxing Organization (WBO) talked of growing up on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, a conservative society where homosexuals are shunned. He said that one of his friends was murdered for being gay and that the pressure made many consider suicide. The boxer came out to his parents in 2001. But it was not until he moved to New Jersey two years ago that he started considered going public. It was at that point he began psychological therapy. Eventually, he decided he was ready to come out and did so in an announcement earlier this month. He now says that he wants to be ‘a force for change’. Once seen as one of the last bastions of homophobia, athletes from a whole of range of sports have announced in recent years they were gay. But no active boxers had come out, until Cruz. San Juan in Puerto Rico: Orlando Cruz said a friend was murdered in his home country due to his sexuality . He said he had been stunned by the amount of support he has received from other professional fighters after initially being filled with anxiety about how people would react. But an intense desire to live an authentic life compelled him to make the announcement. 'The only thing I want is to be respected. I'm an athlete,' he said, exuding confidence moments after his workout to popular salsa tunes. 'I'm a professional and my personal life should not matter to anyone.' Cruz said he began boxing at the age of seven after being captivated by the way Muhammad Ali moved in the ring. 'Muhammad Ali and I, we're very similar. We have the same motion in the ring,' said Cruz. 'We have the same move, the same show. ""This is my ring! It's my show! It's my time!"" That's Muhammad Ali. I love him!' Big night: Cruz takes on Mexican Jorge Pazos in Florida on Friday night . Domiga Torres Rivera, Cruz's mother, recalled the moment, several years ago, when her son held her hands tight and said 'Mom we need to talk' and had difficulty uttering the words: 'I'm gay.' 'For a mother, it's very tough to hear that,' she said. 'But it's your own blood and there's no question that you will love them and support them, not shun them. We can't force our children to be who they're not.' Cruz said he was now ready to move on with his life and focus on the road to the world title. He was ambitious and determined to make it to the top and said his next bout was a key step in that direction. 'I will do it with ease. I respect my opponent, but he is just a stepping stone to me. I cannot wait to hear the sound of that bell,' said Cruz wiping the sweat off his forehead with his glove and shuffling his feet to salsa during a workout break at his training facility in Kissimmee. Mexican fighter Jorge Pazos said he was more focused on his opponent's fighting style than his sexual orientation. 'I don't care because that's something personal,' said Pazos. 'I know he's a great boxer in the ring so that's what I'm focused on.'","Featherweight describes homophobic attacks in his native Puerto Rica .

Counsell was operating a fireworks display at the nearby Taunton Rugby Club, pictured, at the time of the collision . 'The charges are due to his failings in the planning and operation of the display.

'It was clear from the investigation carried out by Avon and Somerset Police that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute for driver error and therefore no action will be taken against any motorists. 'The CPS also considered the culpability of Taunton Rugby Club and reached the conclusion that there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.'Counsell will face magistrates on November 12.Lorry drivers Terry Brice, from Patchway, south Gloucestershire, and Kye Thomas, from Gunnislake, Cornwall, died in the crash. Father and daughter Michael and Maggie Barton, from Windsor, Berkshire, grandparents Anthony and Pamela Adams, from Newport, south Wales, and battle re-enactor Malcolm Beacham, from Woolavington, near Bridgwater, were also killed in the pile-up.Among those badly injured in the crash was Emma Barton, 19, who woke from a five-day coma to discover she had been orphaned.

Sexually explicit messages revealing the ‘dirtiest secrets’ of pupils from a secondary school have been anonymously posted on Facebook. A message was posted on the site urging . pupils at the school, near Barnsley, to send in their 'secrets' to be . added 'anonymously'. Six hundred people have now clicked 'like' on the Facebook page called Penistone Grammar School’s Dirtiest Secrets, which contains crude messages about fellow pupils. Creepy: The Facebook page encouraged pupils at Penistone Grammar School near Barnsley to send in messages revealing their 'dirtiest secrets' The senior deputy head at the school, Geoff Baddock, said the local authority was working with Facebook to tackle the 'appalling' page. 'We’re taking action to warn our students that it is inappropriate and they are putting themselves at risk,' he said. 'We would always take appropriate action against pupils who are putting the school into disrepute and support students who are at risk.' He added: 'One of the aspects of social media is youngsters post things without realising the consequences of it.' The school's senior child protection officer and deputy head teacher, Peter Crook, posted on the page in an attempt to stop pupil’s using it. His message read: 'Hello everyone. I heard about this page today and it’s interesting what you find on FB. It needs removing ASAP, if not, I will take as much time as needed to find out who set this up. Mr Crook.' Similar Facebook pages have been created for other schools in the area, including Barnsley College, Kirk Balk Community College and Darton College. Concern: A number of similar pages have been posted for other schools in the area . A ‘Kirk Balk’s Dirtiest Secrets’ was also set up on Monday night and was spotted by staff the following morning after they were alerted by concerned pupils. The school's head teacher Val Malcolm said : 'One of the biggest issues is the children hadn’t realised what danger they were putting themselves in by putting up a picture on an open website and linking it to the school and their names. 'The pupils didn’t know who had set the page up. Some pupils had also left their personal pages accessible through the public page. 'Luckily it was a pupil who set it up but it could have been somebody looking to groom. That is the danger when you don't know these people. It gives a wonderful opportunity for somebody to take advantage.' Mrs Malcolm said the site included 'childish and unsavoury' comments but that a lot were positive, denouncing the derogatory posts. Three pupils have been excluded from the school temporarily and an assembly was held on Thursday involving pupils who spoke about the importance of e-safety. Mrs Malcolm said the page was reported to Facebook within minutes of being discovered by teachers, but claims the site could have acted more swiftly to remove it. Mrs Malcolm said: 'Facebook should have been acting within minutes. This is about the health and safety of children who may be foolish and not have thought [about] what they were doing, but this is also about the health and safety of those children.' A Facebook spokesman said the page had been removed as it broke the website’s terms. 'Whilst we don’t comment on individual cases content can be removed for a number of reasons such as bullying or harassing another user,' said the spokesman.","'Penistone Grammar School's Dirtiest Secrets' page 'liked' by 600 users .

Rumour after rumour was swirling and stoking the hopes and frustrations of the crowd - there would be gas in two hours, in five hours, in six hours. But once it gets here the question is how long will it last? Last night people were fighting over the dwindling fuel left, but by this morning that desperation had turned into simply finding it - or even the promise of it. At Ozone Park, Queens, New York that ripple of a rumour that a truck was on its way was all that it took. And after two hours of driving past closed gas stations patrolled by police waving angry drivers by it is easy to understand why. Patience: People wait in line for fuel at a Shell Oil station in Fort Lee, New Jersey . By 7.30am the cars were lined up around two blocks. By 10.30am there were more than 100, engines stilled, drivers out, waiting. On the forecourt 50 people were huddled holding their gas cans, water bottles, as many containers they could carry or load onto a trolley. They want fuel and they want answers. For Tiffany Adams a worker for New York City Transport it was the second day of searching and waiting - and she was not alone: 'I drove all down Atlantic Avenue yesterday and every gas station was closed. I've got two kids, a four-year-old and a seven year old. We've got no power, CONED is doing nothing, telling us nothing.' Out of gas: A police officer moves a car that is out of gas, trying to position it so it can fill up, at a gas station in Brooklyn today . Heated: Tempers flared at the Gulf station at Flatbush Avenue and Kings Highway, as customers suspected the gas station attendant was pumping gas for a man that cut in line . Desperate: Last night people were fighting over the dwindling fuel left, but by this morning that desperation had turned into simply finding it - or even the promise of it . Her anger was echoed by others standing by. 'It's all about Manhattan,' said one. 'The mayor's doing a horrible job,' came another and within moments the anger that lies so close to the surface right now bubbled up. People tweeted . asking for information on open gas stations, others tweeted when they . found them or moment by moment as they closed. A Facebook site was set . up to track what was open, what was closed, when gas was perhaps being . delivered, how long the queue to get it. Earl Lucas, 72, had seen something like it before, in the seventies he said when there was, as he put it, 'a real gas shortage.' 'People are angry because the gas is there they just can't get it. Do you know how to get it? Can you use your influence to get some? Wait in line: Queues of people and of cars snake around the block waiting for fuel in this gas station in Newark, N.J. Call for order: A New York City Police officer speaks to a customer at a Hess fuelling station in Brooklyn, New York Harbor as the fuel crisis grips the New York area . 'There were five trucks came in here from a Catholic charity and they got straight through and filled up. Some people can get it.' This is how it starts - the rumours of special treatment, apocryphal or true no-one in this queue really knows but they feed the resentment and frustration offering someone or some group to blame. However united these people may be in a common need the reality is that if that need can't be met for all, camaraderie will swiftly give way to something altogether more ugly. It already has elsewhere. The police know it, that's why they are here and the crowd know it - they can feel it.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:00 EST, 21 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:20 EST, 21 October 2012 . David Cameron faced strong criticism . from Conservative grandee Lord Tebbit today in the aftermath of Andrew . Mitchell's resignation as chief whip. After . the blow of finally losing Mr Mitchell having previously backed him to . stay, the Prime Minister was said to have allowed 'this dog of a . coalition Government' to look incompetent. Lord . Tebbit's criticism came amid reports that Mr Mitchell decided to quit . after younger Tory MPs from the 2010 intake made clear their hostility . when parliament returned this week. Lord Tebbit (left), a cabinet minister from Margaret Thatcher's leadership, has criticised the Prime Minister (right) for allowing the coalition to look incompetent and be called 'a government of unfeeling toffs' Writing in The Observer, Lord Tebbit - a cabinet minister in Margaret Thatcher's government - said: 'This dog of a coalition government has let itself be given a bad name and now anybody can beat it. 'It has let itself be called a government of unfeeling toffs. Past governments have had far more real Tory toffs: prime ministers Alec Douglas-Home and Harold Macmillan, or even in Thatcher's day, Whitelaw, Soames, Hailsham, Carrington, Gowrie, Joseph, Avon, Trenchard and plenty more, without incurring similar abuse.' He added: 'The abiding sin of the government is not that some ministers are rich, but that it seems unable to manage its affairs competently.' Mr Mitchell finally fell on his sword after admitting that the row over his confrontation with Downing Street police made his position untenable. After weeks of criticism and speculation over his future, Mr Mitchell said it was not fair to put his colleagues and family through such 'damaging' stories any longer. Resignation: Andrew Mitchell quit as David Cameron's chief whip exactly a month after losing his temper with police officers for stopping him ride his bicycle out of Downing Street . He insisted in a letter to the Prime . Minister that he had not referred to an officer on the gate in Downing . Street as either a 'pleb' or a 'moron' but acknowledged delivering, . after being told he could not ride his bike through the main gates, the . parting line: 'I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us.' He was swiftly replaced as chief whip by Sir George Young. MPs from across the party have called on Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne to shake up 'the government machine', claiming that too many members of the Downing Street inner circle were 'teenagers' from privileged public school backgrounds with no knowledge of business or executive control. Criticisms voiced yesterday focused on Cameron's closest advisers, including Ed Llewellyn, his old Etonian chief of staff, as well as the Downing Street communications team. They claimed the quality-control mechanism in Downing Street was broken, failing to spot potential difficulties and aid Cameron to make the right decisions. Many MPs blamed Cameron for letting the Mitchell crisis drag on for a month. A Tory MP told The Sunday Times: 'I feel very strongly that accusations of being out of touch is so right. We need to look at the sort of people who are forming policies - these are not the people who go to Sainsbury's regularly, or understand the cost of childcare. They haven't got a clue. It doesn't help that Cameron and Osborne are both privileged public school boys.' David Ruffley, a senior member of the Treasury select committee, told the newspaper No 10 needed to 'tighten up the machine' and change personnel. He said: 'There have been unforced errors made. We can look at the budget, we can look at the rail network. In every case it has been ministers culpable. 'This disgruntlement on the back benches is not just about this Andrew Mitchell resignation. I would expect the prime minister to shore up the government machine.' The alliance of Tory MPs making up about half of the party which decided Mr Mitchell's fate has been dubbed the 'battle of the tea room'. Witnesses to the unsettled scenes in the Commons tea room and the 1922 Committee meeting last week said the majority of the 148 MPs elected to Westminster two years ago had 'signed his death warrant' by relinquishing support for the Chief Whip. According to The Independent On Sunday, one MP recalled 'they hit as a pack', while another said Mr Mitchell 'was trying to be charming but was given the cold shoulder'. 'There was blood on the carpet', said another MP, as Tory Deputy Chief Whip John Randall told MPs that Mr Mitchell had damaged the interests of the party and threatened to resign if the Chief Whip did not. The MP added: 'It was clear then he wouldn't last the week.' At a union rally in Hyde Park today, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the Government remained on the wrong path despite Mr Mitchell's resignation. Conservative support has fallen to 30 per cent, a drop of five points in 10 days and only one point ahead of the Tories' lowest score since the 2010 election. According to a Mail On Sunday poll, Ed Miliband's Labour has increased its lead to 13 points on 43 per cent, with Nick Clegg's Lib Dems scoring eight points, four points below the anti-EU UKIP party. More than one in two voters said Andrew Mitchell should resign as an MP as well as give up his Cabinet seat. Of those polled by Survation, one in four people who voted Tory at the last election said the conduct of Conservative ministers such as Mr Mitchell made them less likely to vote Conservative next time round. The poll was conducted in the immediate aftermath of Mr Mitchell's resignation on Friday and controversy over Chancellor George Osborne travelling in a first-class rail carriage with a standard-class ticket. 'Andrew Mitchell may finally have resigned, but the culture of two nations runs right across this government. 'They cut taxes for millionaires, and . raise taxes for ordinary families. They leave young people out of work . while the bonuses at the banks carry on. 'They even have a Chancellor of the Exchequer who tries to travel first class on a standard class ticket. 'It's one rule for those at the top and another rule for everybody else: everybody like you who plays their part and does the right thing.' In spite of Conservative support plummeting to 30 per cent according to a Mail On Sunday poll, Education Secretary Michael Gove insisted that the difficult stories from the past week would not influence voters. In the Survation poll, one in four people who voted Tory at the last election said the conduct of Conservative ministers such as Mr Mitchell had made them less likely to vote Conservative again at the next election. Mr Gove told Sky News: 'It's always the case that there are weeks when the headlines are populated by stories that are of interest to the Westminster village and contain an element of human drama, but which for most people are just part of the froth of political life and not central to the concerns which will determine how they vote or how they live their lives. 'The Prime Minister, having made his decision, having recognised that Andrew had done an outstanding job as International Development Secretary, felt that he could continue to do a very good job as Chief Whip and bring to the party some of the knowledge and skill he had deployed in a different ministerial role.' In his resignation letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Mitchell said: 'I have made clear to you - and I give you my categorical assurance again - that I did not, never have, and never would call a police officer a 'pleb' or a 'moron' or used any of the other pejorative descriptions attributed to me. 'The offending comment and the reason for my apology to the police was my parting remark 'I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us'. 'It was obviously wrong of me to use such bad language and I am very sorry about it and grateful to the police officer for accepting my apology.' Accepting his resignation, Mr Cameron said he was 'sorry' to receive Mr Mitchell's letter but added: 'I understand why you have reached the conclusion that you have, and why you have decided to resign from the Government. 'I regret that this has become necessary, and am very grateful for all you have done, both in Government and in Opposition - as well as for the kind words in your letter.'","Lord Tebbit: 'It has let itself be called a government of unfeeling toffs'.

Politicians struggling with stress are being treated by an on-site psychiatrist at the Houses of Parliament. The taxpayer funded therapist is holding surgeries for MPs and peers as part of Parliament's occupational health service as more and more politicians admit to suffering with mental health issues. Politicians have access to the psychiatrist across the road at Millbank as part of a contract with St Thomas' Hospital which was signed following the 2010 general election. Open: Both Sarah Wollaston, left, and Charles Walker, right, have spoken openly about their battles with mental illness this year . A Parliamentary spokesman told MailOnline today: 'Parliament is committed to the well-being of members of both Houses and staff. 'Consequently, the House offers a confidential medical screening facility which encompasses both physical and mental wellbeing.' MPs access to a psychiatrist was welcomed by mental health charity Sane. The news follows revelations earlier this year by several MPs who lifted the lid on their debilitating mental health problems during a Commons debate. Former GP and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston told fellow MPs how she suffered severe’ post-natal depression ‘at the happiest time of my life’ and that she had suicidal feelings at her lowest. After returning to work she suffered panic attacks on her commute to work, she revealed. Honest: Labour's Kevan Jones, left, was one of the MPs to speak openly about mental illness earlier this year, while Alistair Campbell, right, has previously spoken out about depression in the political sphere . Tory backbencher Charles Walker also revealed that he had suffered from OCD for more than 30 years having to do everything, from turning off lights to washing his hands, four times. He said at the time: 'Woe betide me if I switch off a light five times – then I must do it another three times.’ Candid: Former Prime Minister Winston Churchill suffered from what he described as the 'black dog' of depression . ‘Counting becomes very, very important. ‘I have been pretty healthy for five years but just when you let your guard down this aggressive friend comes and smacks you right in the face. ‘For example, I was on holiday recently and I took a beautiful photograph of my son carrying a fishing rod and I was glowing with pride. ‘But then the voice starts that if you don’t get rid of that photograph your child will die. 'You know you shouldn’t give in to them because they shouldn’t be there and it ain’t going to happen. 'But in the end you’re not going to risk your child so you give in to the voices and then you feel pretty miserable about life.’ And former defence minister Kevan Jones told MPs that he suffered from depression and that mental illness should not be seen as a weakness in politics. It was thought at the time to be the first time that politicians had spoke so openly about mental illness. In modern times, only Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alistair Campbell has spoken out about depression in the political sphere. Winston Churchill is famously said to have suffered from the 'black dog' of depression.","The therapist is holding surgeries for MPs and peers across the road from Parliament .

The childrens' mother, Marina Krim, . returned to her Upper West Side home on October 25 to find her six-year-old daughter Lucia . and two-year-old son Leo dead in a pool of blood in the bathtub. On hearing Mrs Krim's screams, the building's super ran to the Krims apartment - with his young son trailing behind him to confront the horrific scene. Charged: Nanny Yoselyn Ortega, pictured with Lulu Krim, right, and Nessie, left (who was not in the apartment during the attack), has been charged in their murder . As Marina cradled her surviving daughter, Nessie, the father and . son witnessed Ortega, 50, apparently attempt to inflict a fatal wound across her throat. Her . wrists had already been slit. The young boy will almost certainly undergo therapy to overcome . the trauma. This latest detail emerged as removers packed up boxes of . the Krims' belongings. Sources have suggested the family will not . return to the apartment where Lucia and Leo were . killed. Ortega, Lucia and Leo had been due to meet Mrs Krim and Nessie at a dance studio, but the mother became concerned when they failed to turn up and returned to the home. Loss: Lulu and Leo, pictured, each had multiple stab wounds and were pronounced dead in hospital . Happier times: Marina and Kevin Krim, pictured at a 2009 event at Tavern on the Green in Central Park . After learning from the doorman that the nanny had not left the building, Mrs Krim frantically searched the apartment and came across the grisly scene in the bathroom. Ortega's suicide bid failed and she was put in a medically-induced coma. She has now been brought out of this and charged with first degree murder. When . questioned by police for the first time Saturday, the nanny attempted . to paint Mrs Krim in a bad light, shifting part of the blame for the . tragedy on her. Ortega, who had told neighbours and family that she was short of money, revealed she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to . do and asked her to do the housework. Law . enforcement officials told the New York Post that the Krims asked . their her to do simple housework as a way to . earn money, thinking they were helping. All this did was . enrage her. Father: Kevin Krim recounted the magical Manhattan childhood of his two lost children, the happy memories they accumulated before, police said, their trusted nanny murdered them .

'She said . something like, ""I'm paid to watch the children, not clean up and do . housework"",' a law-enforcement source said of Ortega’s statements to . police after she woke from the coma. Yoselyn became extremely animated . when she discussed the incident with police, telling officers that  she . had numerous disagreements with mother . Marina about how the kids were being cared for. Ortega waived her right to have a lawyer . present during questioning when she ominously told the detective, . 'Marina knows what happened', a source told the New York Times. Reports claimed Marina didn't think . Yoselyn was interacting with the kids enough and was giving them junk . food when she was out of sight. The Krims were also reportedly worried . about Ortega's job performance in the weeks leading up to the killings . and had told her that if she didn't improve, they might need to replace . her.

But for FBI agent Frederick W Humphries the problem, over the past few days, has been the lack of it - publicly at least. Special Agent Fred Humphries has been revealed as the face, and torso, of the 'Shirtless FBI Agent' whose images were found in socialite Jill Kelley's email account. Scroll Down For Video . FBI Special Agent Fred Humphries has been identified as the 'Shirtless FBI Agent' who helped begin the investigation that brought down David Petraeus . It was Humphries who initiated the . investigation into harassing emails sent to Kelley that ultimately led . to the resignation of General David Petraeus. Amid the heat of that exposure the . news of his own apparent indiscretion was treated as another layer of . sexual intrigue in this tangled tale. In fact, Humphries insists, it is . nothing of the sort. The email was a joke that backfired more . spectacularly than he could possibly have imagined and, perhaps, was . allowed to. Emails to a friend: Socialite Jill Kelly arrives home in Tampa on Tuesday night . The image in question was not some . leering pose, directed at the object of his desire, but a round-robin . joke - the sort of which the 47-year-old Special Agent was in the habit . of sending - that ended with a picture punchline. The snapshot showing Humphries - . bald, muscular and shirtless - posed between two buff, bullet-ridden . target dummies and carrying the punchline, 'Which one is Fred?' was . framed and displayed on his wife's desk at work. His supervisor even . pinned it on the notice board in the Bureau. Serious: Humphries is pictured at a news conference in July 2005 at the Federal Courthouse in Seattle . In fact as the Seattle Times reports, . one of the newspaper's staff was among those to receive the email, sent . in 2010 shortly after the Special Agent had been transferred from . Guantanamo Bay to the Bureau's Tampa office. The email was sent on 9 September . 2010. All of which points to the motivation of the sources that first . leaked word of its existence being mischevious at best. Because if not quite an Icarus figure . fallen to earth, Humphries reputation has certainly been allowed to . wilt in the heat of the media glare. July 27, 2005, FBI Agent Frederick Humphries . According to the New York Times . Humphries has a reputation as a 'hard-charging' field agent. It is a . turn of phrase that implies an approach more likely to earn results than . friends. Humphries reportedly received a . dressing down from his superiors when he impatiently tried to push . forward the investigation into the emails received by Kelley. In the field: In this April 12, 2007, photo, Frederick Humphries, right, works a scene in Tampa, Florida . It has been alleged that, frustrated . by what he perceived as a lack of progress, Humphries leaked details of . the probe to the Republicans in Congress, contacting Representative Dave . Reichert in October and asking for his help. Mr Reichert directed him to House . majority leader, Eric Cantor who eventually passed the message onto the . FBI director, Robert S Mueller, completing a circle that looped well and . truly above the heads of Humphries direct superiors. One week later, on November 6th, . Election Day, Mueller went to James Capper the director of national . intelligence and Petraues's immediate superior - who urged him to resign . as head of the CIA. In fact, the House Judiciary . Committee has written to Mueller to ask why it took him a week to come . foward with the information that Humphries gave him. This photo taken Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2012 shows the home owned by FBI agent Frederick Humphries in Dover, Florida . This is not the first time Humphries has found himself on the receiving end of his boss's opprobrium. 'Fred is a passionate kind of guy,' said one former colleague. 'He's . kind of an obsessive type. If he locked his teeth onto something, he'd . be a bulldog.' Humphries 'strong sense of right' led him to push forward the investigation that exposed the affair between Broadwell, pictured above at her brother's home in Washington, and Gen Petraeus . It didn't take long for that tenacity . to show. For some who have worked with him it is part of what makes . Humphries 'one of the finest agents there is'. It is coupled with a . strong sense of right - admirable traits but not always the most welcome . combination to those concerned with the subtleties of state and . politics. Humphries studied Criminology at the . University of Tampa and joined the FBI in 1996. Within two years he was . made the case agent in the Rassam Investigation which foiled Ahmed . Ressam's 1999 plan to attack Los Angeles International Airport. The trial judge in that case . repeatedly praised Humphries for his integrity and efforts. But the . agent still managed to fall foul of his bosses for his outspoken . opposition to the decision to turn Ressam over to New York agents. He . felt that the tactic would unravel what trust had been established and . lead to Ressam's co-operation drying up. He was proved right. Having served in Guantanamo Bay . Humphries might have felt himself on safer ground, transferred to the . Tampa Office, but the opposite has proven true twice over. Tampa society was far more dangerous territory than Humphries could have known. Natalie Khawam, Gen. David Petraeus; Scott and Jill Kelley and Holly Petraeus watch the . Gasparilla parade in Tampa, Florida in 2010 . In May 2010 he was attacked by a knife-wielding man, outside MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa. Humphries, who was training with SWAT and special-forces soldiers at the base, shot and killed the man.

The sidekick who helped the Washington D.C. sniper slay 10 people and wound at least six more in a 2002 rampage has claimed he was sexually abused by the killing spree's mastermind. Lee Boyd Malvo, who was 17 when he indiscriminately shot his victims over a period of three weeks, claimed John Allen Muhammad molested him for more than two years. Speaking to Today in what he said would be his last interview about the crimes, Malvo said: 'For the entire period when I was almost 15 until I got arrested, I was sexually abused by John Muhammad.' Malvo, who is now 27, is serving a . life sentence in a south Virginia prison without the possibility of . parole. Muhammad was put to death by lethal injection in 2009, at age . 48. Scroll down for video . Killers: Lee Boyd Malvo (left), who was 17 when he went on a deadly rampage with John Allen Muhammad (right) in 2002, has claimed that the older man sexually abused him . Today host Matt Lauer quizzed the . murderer about why he had made the molestation claims now, when he had . previously denied a sexual relationship between the pair. 'I . felt a sense of shame, and I just said, ""That’s just something that I'd . never tell anyone"",' Malvo explained in the interview which aired on . Thursday morning. 'And . to a certain extent, up until that point, I really couldn't handle it. The main reason I'm coming forward now is because I am more mature.' He added that solitary confinement has forced him to deal with the past on his own. 'In here, there's no therapy,' he said. 'Rehabilitation is just a word. In solitary confinement, in a cell by . yourself, I am priest, doctor, therapist. So it just worked out that I . just took it off piece by piece.' Malvo was born in Jamaica and moved to Antigua with his family in 1999, where he first met Muhammad. Friends: Malvo, then 17, and Muhammad are pictured together in Louisiana the year of the killings . On the stand: Malvo is brought into court to be a witness for the capital murder trial of Muhammad in 2003 . Speaking to Today, Malvo said that . Muhammad, who he described as a 'good listener', quickly gained his . trust by being the loving figure he had craved. Malvo claimed he was sexually abused by a . babysitter at the age of five and then relatives at the age of eight . before he came Muhammad's victim aged 15. Boy: Malvo, pictured in 1997, met Muhammad in Antigua in 1999 and the man took him under his wing . On October 2, 2002, the pair began their killing spree, gunning down people in the D.C. area. 'I couldn't say no,' Malvo explained. 'I had wanted that level of love and acceptance and consistency for all my life and couldn't find it. I didn't have the willpower to say no.' The terror ended on October 24, 2002, when police caught Muhammad and Malvo as they slept at a Maryland rest stop in a car they had outfitted for a shooter to perch in its boot without being seen. When they were hauled into custody, Malvo said his first thought was not for himself. 'I was intent on protecting Mr Muhammad as best as I could,' he said. 'Death is not what I feared the most. I feared letting him down . more than I feared death.' Malvo was sentenced to life in prison without parole for killing Linda Franklin, a 47-year-old FBI analyst who was shot as she and her husband loaded supplies at a Home Depot in Virginia. The men were also suspected of fatal shootings in Louisiana, Alabama and Arizona. Malvo, who said he has forgiven himself for his heinous crimes, said his punishment of solitary confinement has been effective, calling it 'complete deprivation'. The motive for the attacks remains murky. Malvo said Muhammad wanted to extort $10 million from the government to set up a camp in Canada where homeless children would be trained as terrorists. Muhammad's ex-wife said she believes they were a smoke screen for his plan to kill her and regain custody of their three children. Mastermind: Muhammad, pictured in 2003, was put to death by lethal injection in November 2009 . Vehicle: The killers cut a hole in the trunk of their car, pictured, to shoot their victims undetected . Malvo claimed in a Washington Post interview last month that Muhammad had 'brainwashed' him. Lauer asked Malvo if they had gunned . down other people who had never been identified and he responded that . there were - and that he had admitted as much to police. He said he has contacted the families of five of these victims, 'but there was a point in time where . psychologically, I couldn't handle it. I cannot afford to break down . psychologically in here, because there will be no help.' When Lauer asked him what advice he would give to his victims' families, he responded: 'Please do not allow my actions and the actions of Muhammad to hold you hostage and continue to victimse you for the rest of your life. Do not give me or him that much power.' See below for video .

The 17-year-old CSI student who has been accused of brutally murdering and dismembering schoolgirl Jessica Ridgeway was a goth who wore black and was 'infatuated' with death, it was revealed today. Austin Reed Sigg was arrested late on Tuesday night at his home near Ketner Lake Open Space after his mother tipped off police. He is due back in court today. Sigg will be charged with two counts of murder in the first degree and second-degree kidnapping as well as two counts of criminal attempts. He allegedly confessed to the murder to his mother. The accused killer enjoyed forensic science and won second place in a Crime Scene Investigation competition. Some friends told the media that Sigg expressed interest in becoming a mortician. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Alleged killer: Austin Reed Sigg, 17, was arrested late Tuesday night after Westminster police received a tip that led them to a home near Ketner Lake Open Space . He will also face charges for the attempted abduction of a female jogger near Ketner Lake on May 28. On March 23, he won second place in the Crime Scene Investigation division of the Health Occupation Students of America State Leadership Conference competition, according to The Denver Post. 'He was so infatuated with the idea of death,' Hannah Bane, a college classmate, told a local reporter. Brooke Olds, who has known Sigg for about nine years, told The Denver Channel: 'He was very quiet, shy and to himself. I would say he was gothic,' Though he often complained about school, was interested in mortuary science and was taking forensics classes, said Rachel Bradley, 17, who attended Standley Lake with him. Arapahoe Community College offers the state's only accredited mortuary science program. 'He never really talked about his family or his friends. Like, all he talked about was playing or spending time with us. He always wanted, just, to play capture the flag.' Another student Dakota Foster, 19, said he didn't know Sigg well, but revealed 'he used to hang out with a lot of us in what we called the goth corner (of the school cafeteria), where all the metal heads were'. The teen was arrested at his home at around 7.45pm on Tuesday and Jessica's parents were notified by Westminster police this morning. Speaking after his arrest his mother confirmed she was the one who tipped off police. 'I made the phone call, and he turned himself in. That's all I have to say,' said Mindy Sigg, before she broke down in tears. Sigg's parents are divorced. The father had been arrested many times, local television stations said -- accused of domestic violence, assault and bank fraud. 'This morning the Ridgeway family was notified of this arrest,' Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk said in a lunchtime press conference. From missing to murdered: The Colorado . schoolgirl's gruesomely dismembered body was discovered in a park 10 . miles from her home on October 11, six days after she vanished on her . way to school . 'We hope and pray this arrest gives them some measure of closure in dealing with their horrible loss and tragedy.' The boy's mother said she called . police but Sigg handed himself over to officers. A woman identifying . herself as his aunt said his mother alerted authorities after the Sigg . came to her with some 'disturbing information.' A police report said Sigg was . 'cooperative' when police arrived at his house and was taken to . Westminster police department in handcuffs. He was later taken to . Mountain View Detention Facility. Authorities . said they could not release much information because Sigg is a juvenile . and the affidavits in the case have been sealed under court order. Police were today blocking access to . Sigg's home, which his just 1.4 miles from Jessica's, and a search . warrant had been served on the property, according to The Post. Investigators were also digging through the contents of a dumpster across the street from the Sigg residence and police towed away a bronze Jeep that belonged to the suspect. Hard-work: Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk, pictured during a press conference on Wednesday, praised his team and the community for their help in the case . Crowd: Members of the tight-knit Westminster community gathered to listen to the police announcement . Jessica's great-grandmother said she was thrilled police had made an arrest. 'Grateful to God that the community . pulled together and the police department didn’t quit,' said Donna Moss . told The Denver Channel. The teen will make his first court appearance at 8am tomorrow in Jefferson County. 'We . worked on this case nonstop, around the clock, since October 5, the day . of her abduction,' Birk said. 'I believe we've made a significant step . towards justice for Jessica. 'We . hope also that knowing an arrest has been made in this case can cause . our community to rest a little easier and maybe feel a little safer.' Police . revealed earlier this week the suspect in the attempted abduction was . thought to be the same man who kidnapped and murdered Jessica on October . 5. They have not revealed why they think the two cases are linked. The Colorado schoolgirl's dismembered body was found six days after she vanished on her way to school. In the abduction attempt, an . unidentified young woman was jogging around a lake about a . half-mile from the Ridgeway home when she was grabbed from behind by a man. Evidence: Police towed away Austin Sigg's car, pictured . The . attacker tried to cover her mouth with a chemical-soaked rag but she was . able to escape. According to The Post, the woman described her attacker as a . light-skinned Caucasian male between 18 and 30 years of age, 5 feet 6 to . 5 feet 8 inches tall with a medium build and brown hair. The link between the two cases was confirmed just days after police found a tuft of blonde hair a mile away . from where 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway's body was discovered. After police were alerted to the . scene, a grid search was conducted . while the hair was taken into evidence. But Westminster police . investigating the murder initially dismissed claims that the hair was a . definite clue in the case. A spokesman told the Denver Post last . week that there was nothing to suggest the hair has anything to do with . Jessica or was even human. Another recent clue in the tragic . investigation was a wooden . cross which police believe belonged to Jessica's killer, describing it as a 'pivotal piece of evidence' in the case. Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5 . inches tall by 1 inch wide cross and has a hole at the top so it can be worn as a . necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department on Friday. Hope gone: After the grisly discovery of Jessica's body on October 11, the search for Jessica turned into a hunt for her killer . Recent clue: Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5 . inch tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a . necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department on Friday . 'Authorities are looking for someone . who may carry or wear this type of cross, may have recently purchased . one of these, or is known to have some association with one,' Westminster Police Department Mr Trevor Materasso said in a statement at the time. Police were also looking for local businesses that may sell these types of crosses. The solid wood pendant has three . vertical markings etched into the horizontal bar of the cross and a . zig-zag pattern carved into the opposite side. Mr Materasso added that the item 'could become a pivotal piece of evidence that helps authorities identify and locate Jessica's killer.' Jessica was last seen beginning a . short walk from her home to Witt Elementary School on the morning of . October 5. She never arrived. A search by hundreds of law officers . did not start until hours later because Jessica's mother works nights . and slept through a call from school officials saying Jessica wasn't . there. Then, on October 7, Jessica's backpack was found on a sidewalk in Superior, some 6 miles northwest of her Westminster home. Life cut short: Jessica's body was so dismembered that police had trouble identifying the body . Heartbroken: Jessica's dad, Jeremiah Bryant, pictured, breaks down during a press conference, as Jessica's mother describes their little girl . Family in mourning: Jessica's father, Jeremiah Bryant (left) and mother, Sarah Ridgeway, (second right) were initially investigated by police but have since been cleared of any involvement . At about 5pm on Wednesday October 10, . dozens of officers flooded into Pattridge Park in Arvada, combing the . foot of a hill, walking no more than five feet apart, reportedly working . on a credible tip. The focus of their search was an . abandoned cabin that appeared to have been part of a former mining . operation. The area is now a popular park where neighbors often come to . hike, ride bicycles and fly model airplanes. Police said they did not suspect Jessica's parents, who are divorced and fighting a custody battle . over her, had any involvement in the disappearance. The U.S. Marshals Service, immigration . officials and state Department of Corrections have been reviewing registered . sex offenders in the area. During the heartbreaking investigation, authorities have received more than . 1,500 tips from the public, searched more than 500 . homes and gone through over 1,000 vehicles hunting for clues.

Residents of San Francisco get a shock when Marty McFly apparently turns up and takes a trip around the yachts . See the DeLorean sail across the waves here: . Matt, according to Bloomsberg, is not your typical Google candidate - his current job is as a crab fishermen. But Google is renowned for liking the quirky types of tech enthusiast - as their own in-house job interview questions have shown - and they must admire the fan-boy dedication which went into producing the car. Back to the Future was the seminal sci-fi franchise of the 1980s, combining a powerful time-travel concept with a cool car, classic guitar riffs, and a nostalgic look back to high school in the 1950s. With a young skate-boarding Michael J Fox at the helm, the film jumped from 1985, to the 50s, to the dark distant future of 2015, and then back to the Wild West, all thanks to a DeLorean turbo-charged with a 'flux capacitor', or time machine to you and me. We're going back ... Back to the Future!! Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) and Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) test out the real deal . High performance: The film DeLorean following its first spin through time and space - once it hits 88 miles and hour and 1.21 gigawatts . The original DeLorean was the brainchild of controversial US businessman . John DeLorean who managed to secure £100 million of funding from the . Northern Ireland Development Agency to build the car outside Dunmurry . near Belfast. Despite . having an incredible design which included gullwing doors, the DeLorean . was a spectacular failure as a car and a business. Resurgence: DeLorean went bust but the car became one of the world's most loved after the Back to the Future trilogy starring Michael J Fox, pictured . It was slow, unreliable and . production ceased after just one year in when the company filed for . bankruptcy in 1982. Just 9,200 models left the factory with around 7,000 . thought to remain in existance. But Wynne set up the DeLorean Motor Company in 1995, 16 years after leaving the UK in 1979. He . also acquired the remaining tools, spare parts and distribution rights . for the car along with the trademarked name DMC - cashing in on the name . with deals with the likes of Nike, Mattel and Sony. He will also sell you a completely re-manufactured DeLorean using unused original parts from £37,000. A used DeLorean on the UK market normally goes for between £15,000 to £30,000. Matt started his project in 2008, and in 2010 turned to Kickstarter, which funds creative projects, to raise the $5,000 needed to make the hover-car a reality (minus the time travel mechanisms). The 'car' is actually a fibreglass construction, painted and sprayed to take on the classic DeLorean lines - gull-wing doors included. Placed on an inflating base with an engine, the car can take to the waters around McCovey Cove - near  to the San Francisco Giant's stadium, offfering baseball fans a sprinkling of sci-fi to go with the weekly matches.
