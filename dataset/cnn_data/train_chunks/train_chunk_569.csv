Half-naked pictures of Kate Winslet’s third husband Ned RocknRoll should not be published to protect the actress' young children, a judge said today. Explaining his decision to ban a newspaper printing the embarrassing pictures of Mr RocknRoll, Mr Justice Briggs said there was a 'real risk' that Miss Winslet's daughter and son would be ridiculed at school. The 'innocent but embarrassing' photographs were taken of Mr RocknRoll at a private fancy dress party with an 'outrageous' theme more than two years ago, the High Court had heard. Kate Winslet and her new husband Ned RocknRoll went to London's High Court to stop the pictures being printed . They were taken by party guest James Pope in July 2010 and posted on his Facebook account. The Sun had argued that publication of the 'semi-naked photos' would be justified because Mr RocknRoll - who changed his name from Edward Abel Smith - was a public figure. Mr RocknRoll, 34, who was previously . married to Viscount Cowdray's daughter Eliza, used to work as 'Head of . Astronaut Relations' for the space travel branch of his uncle's Virgin . empire before becoming a sheep farmer. The judge said: 'Mr RocknRoll’s . employment with Virgin Galactic comes nowhere to placing him in that . narrow category of persons who, although engaged in no public office, . may be regarded as having reduced expectations of privacy due to their . important role in national affairs. 'They may include the chairmen of . major public companies and the captains of national sporting teams, but . Mr RocknRoll was, so far as the evidence goes at this stage, no more . than a not very conspicuous middle manager in his uncle’s private . business empire. 'In any event, that role ceased some two years ago.' Mr Justice Briggs ruled in favour of Mr RocknRoll . In a written judgment published yesterday, the judge added:'Mr RocknRoll has, inevitably, briefly become something of a public figure as a result of his relationship with, and now marriage to, Miss Winslet. 'To some unavoidable degree this has led to published photographs of them together, but not so as to place Mr RocknRoll in the public sphere in his own right.' Mr RocknRoll, who is Miss Winslet's third husband, had argued he was not a role model and was a 'relative nobody' before his marriage to Miss Winslet. His lawyers said publication would be a breach of privacy, would not be in the public interest, and could lead to Miss Winslet’s daughter and son being bullied. Lawyers for the Sun said the images . revealed conduct which 'some people might legitimately regard it as . being unacceptable behaviour'. And newspaper editors said they would . pixelate any the parts of photographs which showed the 'lower half' of . Mr RocknRoll’s body. But Mr Justice Briggs said that while the photographs showed him partially naked and engaged in . 'rather silly, schoolboy-like behaviour', they were taken at a private party and he was not expecting them to be made public. He also said publication of them could harm the children's relationship with their mother's new husband. Won his fight: Lawyers for Mr RocknRoll had argued in London's High Court that he was not a public figure . He said: 'There is in my view good reason to . suppose that, if the photographs or a description of their content were . published... there . is real reason to think that a grave risk would arise as to Miss . Winslet’s children being subjected to teasing or ridicule at school . about the behaviour of their newly acquired stepfather, within a short . period after his arrival within their family, and that such teasing or . ridicule could be seriously damaging to the caring relationship which, . on the evidence, the claimant is seeking to establish with them.' After Mr Justice Briggs ruled against Sun publisher News Group Newspapers on January 8, Miss Winslet said she aimed to maintain privacy and refused to accept that her family could not lead a 'relatively normal life'. Miss Winslet and Mr RocknRoll, who married in New York last month, said in a statement: 'We have stopped The Sun from publishing semi-naked photos of Ned taken by a friend at a private 21st birthday party a few years ago. 'The photos are innocent but embarrassing and there is no reason to splash them across a newspaper. 'We recognise that in the internet age privacy is harder and harder to maintain. 'But we will continue to do what we can, particularly to protect Kate’s children from the results of media intrusion. 'We refuse to accept that her career means our family can’t live a relatively normal life.' No detail of what the photographs . showed emerged at the public hearing earlier this month. The judge heard . evidence about detail in the photographs in private. Mr Justice Briggs was told at the . hearing earlier this month that the dispute over publication rights . could be fully aired at a High Court trial. And he banned publication . pending any trial. But lawyers for both sides told the judge yesterday that there would be no trial. They said Mr RocknRoll and the Sun . had now agreed an undisclosed settlement of the litigation.","Mr Justice Briggs explained why he banned publication of pictures of Miss Winslet's new husband .

A pimp charged City workers up to £510 an hour for cocaine-fuelled sex with Eastern European prostitutes, a court heard today. Sorient Sigba allegedly sent chauffeurs to City strip clubs to ferry revellers to the mews house in central London where they would pay hundreds for sex and drugs. Prosecutors say the brothel took in £1million a year before it was shut down by police who targeted it in an undercover sting. Brothel: Sorient Sigba, left, is accused of joining Vera Fosuhene, right, in providing prostitutes to City workers . When men arrived at the house, they were met by scantily clad prostitutes reclining on leather sofas before being taken into one of three bedrooms, Southwark Crown Court heard. The wealthy customers were allegedly charged £300 an hour if they paid cash, or £390 by card, with wraps of cocaine provided for £60. Sigba, 54, is alleged to be one of three men who ran the sex den in Holborn and split the profits between them. 'We say that Sorient Sigba was, to use the vernacular, the pimp,' prosecutor Christiaan Moll told the court. 'He was in charge of hiring, firing and paying the girls, and Freddy was the name that the defendant was known by at the establishment.' Sting: Sogba, pictured outside court today, was allegedly caught by police after they launched an undercover investigation . Simon Earl has already pleaded guilty to managing the brothel, while Michael Wallen has admitted laundering £946,776 of profit between January and October 2011. Brothel madam Vera Fosuhene, 46, pleaded guilty to managing a brothel and supplying cocaine. All three will be sentenced at the conclusion of Sigba's trial. Mr Moll said an email to Sigba found at Earl and Wallen's Greenwich office read: 'Freddy, drivers' names mean nothing to me, that is what you are supposed to be doing. 'Simon deals with the flat and cards, I deal with the figures and you deal with the girls and the drivers.' But the prosecutor told jurors: 'Just because Earl, Wallen and Fosuhene have pleaded guilty does not mean that this defendant Mr Sigba is guilty. 'What it does mean is that there was a conspiracy to control prostitution for gain, and a conspiracy to transfer criminal property, and there was a brothel where drugs were sold. 'The question for you to consider is whether this defendant was knowingly playing a part in this enterprise.' The court heard the brothel was targeted as part of a police operation aimed at smashing London vice rings. Undercover officers visited the property on three occasions after being approached by mini-cab drivers outside the City Burlesque club in Farringdon. Mr Moll said that during the first visit in July 2011 the door to the brothel was opened by Fosuhene. 'Inside the lounge there were five scantily clad girls of eastern European origin aged approximately 20 to 25 years old,' said the barrister. 'Angelina asked the officer how long he wanted, and when he stated he wanted an hour she told him it would cost £300.' During a second visit in October 2011 a Jaguar, later found to be registered to Sigba, was parked outside the property and Sigba opened the door to the brothel, Mr Moll said. The officer apparently asked if he could buy two wraps of cocaine, and was charged £120 for the drugs. Police raided the brothel later that day and discovered envelopes stuffed with cash, worksheets, a letter addressed to Earl, and a sex toy. When officers arrested Sigba at his office they found a hire purchase agreement for a Jaguar seen outside the brothel, and worksheets identical to those found there. Mr Moll said: 'That links him in, we say, with what was happening at the brothel.' When they searched his home address they discovered paperwork relating to a two-bed property in Mayfair and a bag of sex toys. Sigba, of Barnehurst in Kent, denies conspiracy to control prostitution for gain and conspiracy to transfer criminal property. The trial continues.

The brother of former EastEnders actress Gemma McCluskie was caught on camera dragging a heavy suitcase containing his sister’s body parts, a court heard. The grainy CCTV footage captured balding Tony McCluskie as he struggled to drag the dismembered body in the two foot high and three foot long case along the Regent’s Canal towpath in Hackney late at night. Other cameras then recorded him as he walked across the pedestrianised Haggerston Bridge to the other side of the canal. A short while later he was picked up by the cameras before walking home without the suitcase. Trial: Tony McCluskie, 35, (right) admits killing Gemma McCluskie, 29, (left) but claims he has no memory of it . Cordoned off: A police officer by Regent's Canal in east London where Miss McCluskie's torso was found in a suitcase after being thrown into the water in March last year . Nearly a quarter of an hour earlier . CCTV footage showed McCluskie waiting for a mini cab and then struggling . to get it into the boot before being driven to the canal in East London . where the torso, limbs and head of his sister were dumped. Hours later in the early hours of the morning the camera on Haggerston Bridge once again captured McCluskie near the canal. It is alleged the 35-year-old cannabis . smoker spent over three hours chopping his sister into bits after he . bludgeoned her to death following a row about an overflowing sink. Witness: Taxi driver Jilul Haque drove Tony McCluskie, carrying a suitcase, to Regent's Canal in London where he then threw it into the water . The Old Bailey heard she wanted to . throw him out after becoming frustrated with the amount of superstrong . skunk cannabis Tony was smoking. He had also flooded his . mother’s bathroom after forgetting to turn a tap off on the day Mrs McCluskie was killed. The jury were shown CCTV that captured the last hours of Miss McCluskie's life. Wearing a distinct yellow mustard . coloured top, blue leggings and tan Ugg boots she was seen mingling for . an hour at a reception to celebrate the reopening of the Royal London . Hospital in Whitechapel. Then a CCTV camera at a health centre . recorded Miss McCluskie in her blue VW Polo returning to the Shoreditch home she . shared with Tony and mother Pauline, who at the time was in hospital. The shot recorded just before 1.50pm . on March 1 was the last sighting of the 29-year-old who played the . character Kerry Skinner, the great niece of Ethel Skinner, in the hit . soap. But the following night around 10.30pm McCluskie rang his local mini cab office enquiring if there was a free cab. Minutes later he turned up at the office in Waterson Street. Controller Hamid Ahmed said McCluskie . hesitated before giving his name as Tom and asked to be taken to the 'Kingsland Road just by the canal.' Driver Jilul Haque said: 'He had a . bag - two foot high and three foot wide - a large bag. I asked him what . was in the bag and he replied to me his system - I thought he meant his . music system. 'He lifted it with two hands under that bag because it looked heavy.' He added they drove for five minutes in silence before dropping him off and added: 'He did not look like a good man.'

When you see someone falling over on an icy pavement, most people's first reaction is to help them up and check they're not hurt. But that wasn't the case with this mystery cameraman in Norwich, who noticed everyone falling over at a particular spot in the frozen city centre.

Going: The pedestrian's high-visibility jacket is of no use to him as he loses his footing on the treacherous ice . Gone: The poor man lands heavily on his left side and a passer-by rushes to help after he's beaten by the ice . The result is an unfortunately hilarious piece of footage showing pedestrian after pedestrian after stubborn pedestrian come a cropper on the ice. Like penguins in a nature documentary, one person after the other decides to ignore the warning sign and traffic cones and try their luck on the Duke Street bridge over the River Wensum. The film, which is accompanied by trance music, was watched more than 25,000 times in the 24 hours after it was posted yesterday. Entitled 'Duke Street Hazard', as a reference to the popular 1980s American TV series The Dukes of Hazzard, it says: 'There is a single spot where it is almost inevitable not to fall over, as you can see!' It shows dozens of pedestrians, thankfully none of them wearing Daisy Duke's tiny hotpants, skid and land heavily on their bottoms as they try to get past the ice. Hundreds of people posted comments, with one saying: 'Everyone was probably thinking to themselves﻿ ""I hope nobody saw that"". 'Actually the whole internet will see that ;)'.

Wales and the West Country were particularly badly hit, with hundreds of schools closed and motorists facing treacherous conditions.

The pilot who died when his helicopter crashed into a crane in central London may have been distracted trying to change the frequency on his radio, an aviation expert said. Pete Barnes, a veteran pilot with more than 25 years' experience, could have veered off route and missed a turning on the River Thames as he tried to radio Battersea heliport to say he wanted to make an unscheduled landing because of the fog. Aviation lawyer and qualified pilot James Healy-Pratt told the Daily Telegraph: 'It could have taken 10 to 15 seconds to make the change of radio frequency, in which time the helicopter could have flown up to half a mile.' Scroll down for video . The mangled remains of the crane's cabin are clearly visible as a worker inspects the damage caused by Wednesday's helicopter crash . Air accident investigators are likely to focus on trying to account for a 'missing minute', during which Mr Barnes was out of contact with flight controllers. The crane has been severely damaged but Health and Safety Executive officers say it not in danger of collapse and work will begin tomorrow to replace the broken parts . Mr Barnes, 50, from Berkshire, died when the AgustaWestland 109 he was piloting crashed into a crane at the side of The Tower at St George Wharf at 8am on Wednesday, just yards from Vauxhall Station. His helicopter plunged to the ground 700ft below, killing Matthew Wood, 39, as he walked to work. Post mortem examinations held at Greenwich Mortuary yesterday have found that Mr Barnes died from multiple injuries and Mr Wood from severe burns and a leg injury. An inquest will open in due course. Mr Barnes had been flying from Redhill . in Surrey to Elstree, Hertfordshire, but he asked to be diverted to . Battersea heliport because of bad weather. David Learmount, from aviation . website Flightglobal, told the Independent that a small change in . weather conditions, which are thought to have worsened at about the time . of the accident, could have been enough to 'trap' Mr Barnes. 'Weather will turn out to be the key . issue (in the investigation). When you fly in marginal conditions, it . only needs a little dip in what you were expecting and you're pretty . much trapped,' Mr Learmount said. 'He probably did not see the crane . until it was too late. Sometimes even bright lights are difficult to see . in foggy conditions.' Today Daily Mail diarist Richard Kay . revealed how Mr Barnes was on his way to pick up restaurant and clubs . tycoon Richard Caring when he crashed. The 62-year-old entrepreneur was . waiting at Elstree airport in Hertfordshire, unaware that the aircraft . had diverted to Battersea heliport because of fog. Last night, Caring said he was devastated by the death of pilot Peter Barnes, whom he described as a ‘very dear friend’. It emerged yesterday that commuter Matthew Wood was only caught in the disaster because he arrived at work early. The . dedicated Rentokil manager regularly turned up at his office yards from . the scene of the tragedy before his required start time, his family . said. Victims: Veteran pilot Peter Barnes, left, may have been distracted trying to change his radio frequency before the crash which killed him and commuter Matthew Wood, right, who had arrived early to work . Mr Wood’s younger brother yesterday told how the last contact he had with him minutes before disaster struck was a touching message about his 11 month nephew who was in hospital. Darren Wood, 35, said he texted his brother shortly before 8am on Wednesday reassuring him that the youngster was doing well. Mr Wood replied with a text saying: ‘Good news.’ His brother said: ‘That was the last I heard from him. At least he was happy. ‘He was a very family oriented guy and he doted on his nephew.' Forensic teams continue to search the wreckage around the crash site yesterday afternoon . Health and Safety investigators say the crane is not at risk of collapse and work to replace the damaged parts will start tomorrow . Moments after Mr Wood sent the text, the helicopter smashed into the crane and turned into a fireball, sending burning debris plunging the street below near Vauxhall station. His brother frantically tried to contact Mr Wood again after hearing news of the crash. He said: ‘I kept texting and saying ‘If you’re alright, text back’ and he didn’t, so I thought something was wrong. ‘I called the office and they said everyone was accounted for and that he might be on the Tube so maybe that’s why he wasn’t answering. We got the bad news at about 3.30pm.’ Mr Wood, from Sutton in South London, was single and did not have any children, but was godfather to several youngsters. He . planning to hold a party to celebrate his 40th birthday in April. His . family said the event will now be held as a tribute to him. His . brother added: ‘You couldn’t have wished to meet a nicer person. He . loved his family and was always socialising with his friends.’ One . of the workmen who should have been in the crane, but avoided the . disaster because he slept in, told The Sun how scores of other drivers . narrowly escaped being killed because of the traffic lights. Crane drivers Nicki Biagioni (left) with his wife Leanna and Richard Moule (right) with his wife Stephanie, both avoided the disaster because they slept in and were late for work . Nicki Biagioni has just arrived at the scene of the crash when bits of metal began falling down. Air accident investigators are set to examine whether warning lights on the top of the crane were working at the time of the crash.The top of St George's Wharf was obscured by mist and fog on Wednesday morning.The Civil Aviation Authority had issued a notice about the newly-erected crane to airmen.This included a note that a warning light was 'lit at night' but it was unclear if it was lit during the day.Crane driver Nicki Biagioni said yesterday the crane was in a safe position with its aviation warning lights working just hours before the accident.The father-of-three from Essex, said that he was the last person at the top of the crane before the accident.He said: ‘It had two lights. Two on the end of the jib. People are talking about whether the light was on or off.‘These things are aviation lights, they cannot be turned on or off.‘One of them is hardwired in with a back-up power supply and the other one is solar powered. So it is not something you can turn on and off. Obviously the bulbs can go, but they were both working.’Mr Biagioni said he and Mr Moule have been best friends since they were toddlers and that he had taught his friend how to drive cranes. He said: 'When I came running out I saw at least eight or nine cars waiting at the lights, just 20 metres from the wreckage. 'If the lights had turned green seconds earlier they would have moved to a second set of lights under the crane. 'They would have been crushed to death for certain.' The father-of-three, of Ongar, Essex, said the workmen had often seen helicopters flying past their crane cab but never considered that one would fly into them. Work to make the scene safe and remove the crane continued today. A spokesman for Brookfield Multiplex, the building contractor at The Tower, said the crane wreckage will be removed in two stages. Small loose parts of the crane were . removed or secured yesterday, and today work to erect a 600-tonne mobile . crane at the site will take place, weather permitting. Work . on removing and replacing the damaged sections of the crane will start . tomorrow, and the company hopes to finish the process by the middle of . next week. The crane is not . at risk of collapse and has been examined by the Health and Safety . Executive and Lambeth Council, the company said. Cordons and road closures remain in place around the transport hub as work continues to remove the mangled wreckage. Building contractor Brookfield Multiplex said it hopes to complete the process by the middle of next week, while Transport for London advised drivers to avoid the area throughout the weekend. Drivers are advised to avoid the Vauxhall Cross and Kennington Park areas today and over the weekend. Motorists who have to enter the . congestion charge zone as a result of diversions will not have to pay . the toll while using signed routes. Leon Daniels from TfL said: 'Our staff continue to work and minimise disruption to people travelling through the Vauxhall area following the terrible incident and are assisting the emergency services where necessary. 'Due to the ongoing road closures and diversions, traffic in the area has been very busy. 'We are therefore strongly advising road users to avoid the area and use alternative routes throughout Friday and across the weekend.'

The location of his remains was a mystery until late 2011, when scientists used DNA testing to identify Kelly's bones as those of a skeleton exhumed from a mass grave at the former Pentridge Prison site.

WATCH: Catholic church in north-east Victoria bids farewell to famous outlaw . Australia's most infamous criminal Ned Kelly holds a gun in Melbourne . Edward 'Ned' Kelly was the first son of Irish convict John 'Red' Kelly, who moved to Australia in 1848. Ned was born in Beveridge, just north of Melbourne, some time between June 1854 and June 1855. At the age of 14, Ned was arrested for the first time for assaulting a Chinese pig farmer. Ned had numerous run-ins with the police over the years, starting when he was 14 and arrested for allegedly assaulting a Chinese man. The year after, he was arrested again, this time for being a suspected accomplice of robber Harry Power. Both these charges were dismissed, but it was too late: Ned had come to the attention of the police. Some years later a police officer went to the Kelly home, hoping to arrest Ned's brother Dan for stealing horses. The officer claimed that when he turned up he was shot in the wrist by Ned, although it was unclear whether Ned was even present at the time. Ned's mother Ellen was arrested for aiding and abetting an attempted murder and sentenced to three years . Ned and other members of his family went into hiding and hoped by starting up a whiskey distillery they could earn enough money to appeal their mother's sentence. But the police were hot on their heels. Four officers were dispatched to track them down and Ned ended up killing three of them, officially becoming an outlaw.

Andrew Wilson, 50, has been left livid after the jobsworth official slapped a £70 ticket on his van which he parked on his driveway at his home in Lincoln. Ironically, the double yellow lines are intended to stop other motorists blocking his way out. Livid: Window cleaner Andrew Wilson was given a £70 parking fine because his van was overhanging yellow lines by one inch . 'Milking it': The van was parked near the end of the driveway because of building work going on at a neighbour's property . Mr Wilson has been unable to pull any further onto his drive because of building work being carried out on a neighbour's property. But he said the female traffic warden would not listen to reason when he explained. 'I went out ranting and raving and saying 'what are you doing?' he said. 'There was about three or four people in our street shouting at her. She said there was nothing she could do about it. Action: Mr Wilson has accused the council of trying to 'milk people of every penny' and says he will fight the parking ticket . 'I said 'you can see the driveway, I can't use it' and she just walked off. The wheels are on my drive but the tiniest part of the vehicle is overhanging the lines. 'I would say it was hanging maybe half way over the first yellow line, probably only two centimetres. 'The warden must have got a ruler out and measured just how far over the line I was. 'The galling thing is the lines are there to stop my and other people's cars being blocked in by other people.' Andrew, who lives with his wife Keely, 39, and daughter Shania, 13, slammed Lincolnshire County Council for 'milking people of every penny' and vowed to appeal the fine. 'It's a £70 fine but if you pay it in 14 . days then it's £35. I'm not going to pay it. I've appealed against it . and sent the photos I took. 'I have been living here for three and a half years and the yellow lines have always been there but I've never had a problem.

'It is just stupid. It is milking us for every penny we have. It is disgusting.' Mick Phoenix, parking services manager for Lincolnshire County Council, said: 'Mr Wilson has appealed against his ticket, so we will be investigating this. This will involve comparing any notes or photos taken by the parking officer with the evidence supplied by Mr Wilson. 'We usually have a decision in around 14 working days.The parking officers are asked to take a common sense approach when issuing a ticket. If we find Mr Wilson has been penalised in error, we will, of course cancel his ticket. However, if the ticket is upheld, there is option to reappeal.'

Rampage: Eric Ramsey, 30, of central Michigan, 'abducted a college student at gunpoint, raped her, set fire to a house, stole a flatbed truck, rammed three police cars' before police shot him dead . The message: 'Well folkes im about to get shot. Peace,' read the message that he posted to his Facebook page moments before he was shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy . ‘I've been in this community for 35 years,’ Central Michigan University Police Chief Bill Yeagley told the Detroit Free Press. ‘I don't remember anything like this.’ Police say the rampage started around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday as the student, a senior from the Grand Rapids area, walked to her Ford Escape, which was parked in a lot just outside of the Student Activities Center in the middle of CMU's Mt. Pleasant campus. ‘We don't know what possessed him to do that. We may never find out,’ said Isabella County Sheriff Leo Mioduszewski. Mioduszewski said Ramsey drove the woman in her own vehicle to a home off campus and bound and raped her there. He said Ramsey then put her back in the Ford Escape and pledged to kill her, but she escaped the moving vehicle and ran to a home yelling for help. While the woman was inside the home talking to an emergency dispatcher on the phone, Ramsey ‘ended up pouring gasoline on the house and then lit on fire,’ Mioduszewski said in a statement. A 14-year-old boy, his 11-year-old sister and 2-year-old brother were alone inside the home in nearby Lincoln Township when the woman banged on the door for help. The teenager, James Persyn III, told Mlive.com that he let the woman in, locked the door and grabbed his hunting knife. He said he while the woman was using his phone to call 911, he moved her, his siblings and the family dog into the bathroom. Meanwhile, the sheriff said, ‘one of the homeowners arrived home ... and was able to put the fire out,’ using an extinguisher. Ramsey was spotted early Thursday in Otsego County, where he rammed the first of two state police cars. The sheriff said he subsequently stole a garbage truck and was fatally shot by a deputy in Crawford County, about 70 miles north of the university. Campus police Chief Bill Yeagley said Ramsey told the woman that he chose her at random outside the Student Activity Center on campus. The chief said the woman saved her own life by fleeing from the car. ‘I believe she made all the right choices,’ Yeagley said. ‘She's the true hero in this.’Central Michigan University President George Ross said the school would support the Grand Rapids-area woman and her family. Previous record: Ramsey had been on parole since last summer after serving the minimum five-year prison sentence for assault with intent to do great bodily harm . Ramsey had been on parole since last summer after serving the minimum five-year prison sentence for assault with intent to do great bodily harm, according to Corrections Department online records. The maximum sentence was 15 years. Inmates are eligible for a parole review once they serve the minimum punishment. ‘The parole board generally doesn't give a rationale for why or why they don't parole (an inmate),’ said Russ Marlan, a Corrections Department spokesman. ‘I looked at his behavior in prison. He was pretty good. He had six misconducts over five years. That's a small amount. He was in minimum security the entire time.’ Ramsey had a job, regularly met with his parole officer and had tested negative for drugs, Marlan said. His record also included convictions for destruction of police or fire property, resisting police and assault with a dangerous weapon.

Assaulted: Sarah Rix, 43, pictured, was lured to Milford Pre-School Plus in Hampshire, where she was beaten with a bottle by Melissa Morey. Morey was jailed for eight months for the attack . A pre-school worker tricked her supervisor into returning to the workplace out of hours, where she beat her over the head with a bottle before setting her car on fire. Melissa Morey, 43, posed as a police officer, informing Sarah Rix that there had been a burglary at the school building. But when the 43-year-old arrived at Milford Pre-School Plus in Hampshire, Morey was lying in wait to carry out the vicious assault. Morey, dressed in a hooded top, pounced on her hapless colleague, smashing the bottle over her head and stamping on her while she lay on the ground. The attack was so violent that investigators were able to tie Morey to the attack from boot marks left on her victim's back. Morey, of Lyndhurst, Hants, was jailed for eight months after admitting assault causing actual bodily harm, theft of a motor vehicle and arson at Winchester Crown Court. After the attack, Morey hijacked Miss Rix's Fiat Punto, abandoned it a short distance away and set fire to it. Judge Susan Evans QC rejected a claim by the defence that Morey had been bullied by Miss Rix. The court heard how the victim, a mother-of-one, now suffers sleepless nights and panic attacks after the attack by the woman she thought of as a friend. She was sitting at her home in Lyndhurst home with her son, 14, when Morley called claiming to be a police officer. Miss Rix said: 'She said she was calling . from New Milton police station, nearby, and that there had been a . break-in at the pre-school. Arson: Morey hijacked Miss Rix's Fiat Punto after the attack, abandoned it a short distance away in a church car park and set fire to it (stock image) 'She asked if I could go in, as I'm the key holder for the school, to inspect some damage that had been done.' She then drove to school and spotted a hooded figure in an alcove . as she walked towards the entrance. She was then struck on the head, inflicting a deep wound. Recalling the incident, Miss Rix said: 'I was hit again and she was pushing me down and I was screaming, 'Please leave me alone'. 'When I was on the floor she got her arm around my neck and I was in a hold and she said 'I have got a knife'. She kicked me on the back while I was on the floor really hard. She kicked and stamped on me about five times. 'The way she was going at me was so vicious that I thought I was going to die. I still can't believe it was her.' Morey then drove her car to a church car park and torched it. Miss Rix, frantic with worry because her son was at home alone, immediately rang friends and the emergency services. Meanwhile, Morey went home and retrieved her car, driving past the scene while her victim was still being . treated by paramedics. Miss Rix says she is still 'mystified' by what prompted the attack, which left her hospitalised. She said: 'The police officers who were dealing with it said it was the strangest case they had ever come across. I have never bullied anyone in my life - if I had, someone would have noticed as we are in a small pre-school. 'We've known each other for 10 years and I thought we were quite good friends.' A charge alleging Morey impersonated a police officer was dropped.","Melissa Morey, 43, jailed for eight months after attacking Sarah Rix .

"PUBLISHED: . 05:28 EST, 18 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:07 EST, 18 January 2013 . Traditionally, Lent was a solemn period of contemplation leading up to Easter when we wore hairshirts or denied ourselves food. But this year, the Church of England is advocating a more modern approach, suggesting we turn off our computers and eat breakfast cornflakes more slowly, instead. New official guidelines on how we might observe Lent in 2013 also suggest we 'Say hi to a neighbour' and turn off lights in a room we're not using. 'Have a screen-free day': The Church's modern Lent guidelines are backed by the Archbishop of York . The 21st century take on the 40-day religious observance comes in booklet called Love Life Live Lent, launched yesterday at the House of Commons by Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu. Apparently inspired by the way Great Britain 'came together' during last year's Jubilee and Olympic celebrations, the Church of England issued the new advice to encourage us to 'slow down' in our hectic lives and 'come together' for the good of our local communities. The booklet contains a different tip for each day of Lent. One reads: 'It is so easy to get side-tracked, pulled into watching that bit more telly or to spend that bit more time on the computer.  We don’t intend to, it just happens. 'Sometimes all we need to do is to make the decision to do something different, some good that we meant to do but haven’t so...do something different. 'Outside of work, have a screen free day and do something different' 'Really taste your cornflakes': The Church of England advice is aimed at getting us to slow down . Another passage says: 'The world whirls by at ever-increasing speeds.... we can go at such a speed that we forget to savour the good things that we have. 'The ability to savour is a frame of mind, and if we become better at tasting our cornflakes we might discover that we get better at savouring other good things too, so slow down... 'Take longer over breakfast and really savour your cornflakes (or whatever else you have!)'. No more hairshirts: The Church of England has issued more modern advice for both adults and children . The booklet includes eco-friendly advice such as 'Fill a bag with litter', 'Use the washing-up water to water some plants', and 'Turn off the lights in rooms that no-one is using'. It also encourages Christians to build relationships within their community, suggesting 'Invite someone you don't know very well to tea (or for a coffee, or for a drink)', or to 'Say hi to your neighbours today or when you next see them'. It says: 'The idea is that we learn new . lessons about ourselves, about the world and about God that we then . apply for the rest of our lives.' The booklet was written by theologian Dr Paula Gooder and her husband, the Reverend Peter Babington, and they also produced a children's version. The booklet contains suggestions for youngsters to try during Lent such as 'Play with someone you don't usually play with', and 'Make some cakes and share them with your friends'. At yesterday's launch, Dr Sentamu said the new advice was aimed at bringing communities together as witnessed last year. He said: 'In 2012 the nation really came together during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympics. 'We saw people putting love and care for their neighbours into action, and there was a real mood of celebration. 'When we all pull together, and do our bit, anything is possible. 'The Love Life Live Lent books are a great source of encouragement for us to be the change we want to see in our communities. 'We may feel our own contribution is small, but even a small drop of water can turn a waterwheel - in 2013 let's aim for better.' Stephen Timms, MP, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Faith and Society, said: 'This Lent, I look forward to hearing of acts of kindness on the part of adults and children which can encourage us all.' Say hi to your neighbours today or when you next see them . Try something new, for example a different food or a new experience . Fill a bag with litter (then put it all in the bin!) Say thank you to God for one of your meals today . Ask someone how they are and take time to listen to the answer . Use the washing-up water to water some plants . Take longer over breakfast really taste your cornflakes (or whatever else you have!) Sit still for five minutes and listen to your breathing . Give lots of smiles away today . Find something you don't use and give it away . Learn the words of something by heart, for example a poem, prayer or son . Outside of work, have a screen-free day and do something different . Phone someone you love but haven't seen for a while .","New official guidelines suggest we 'slow down and savour the good things'

They’re traditionally seen as Victorian winter ailments straight out of the pages of a Dickens novel. But soaring numbers of Britons are buying treatments for gout and chilblains, new figures show. And experts say the excesses of Christmas and the cold weather are to blame. The online pharmacy Chemist Direct has reported that sales of  CherryFlex - aimed at reducing . the effects of gout – are up 66 per cent so far this month, compared to the . whole of October, November and December combined. Cherries contain antioxidants, which it's claimed help to counter the high levels of uric acid . that trigger gout. A study last year found that hospital admissions for the condition have increased by 80 per cent in a decade to more than 4,400 a year. Experts blame eating and drinking to . excess for the illness caused by a build-up in the blood of uric acid, a . waste product formed by the breakdown of food, beer and wine. If someone produces too much uric acid, tiny crystals will start to form in the joints and cause pain and inflammation. 'We believe that much of the rise in demand is down to over excesses of Christmas and New Year,' said Krishna Soma, superintendent pharmacist at Chemist Direct. 'Too much alcohol and rich food can raise the levels of uric acid. This has not been helped by the dreadful weather which has meant people remaining pretty sedentary and not exercising. Experts say eating and drinking to excess is to blame for gout (pictured) 'Many people with the symptoms (joint pain) to do not always realise they may have gout,' she said. The painful illness is known as the disease of kings as it afflicted a number of monarchs including Henry VIII. Meanwhile, the cold weather in recent days has also seen an increase in sales of chilblains cream. The ailment, which causes the skin to become red, inflamed and very itchy, is caused when extremities such as toes and fingers warm up too quickly after being exposed to bitter cold. It is normally more common in children. 'Chilblains – or erythema perni - were traditionally caused by people toasting frozen fingers and toes beside a fire or in a scalding bath,' said Ms Soma. 'However, it can have the same affect on children playing out in the snow, before going inside and warming their hands directly on radiators.' She advised: 'In many cases we suspect people will be unfamiliar with the symptoms, such as burning, itching and inflamed skin. We suggest they treat the affected areas with chilblain creams, and if in doubt consult their GP.'","Experts say the rise is due to the excesses of Christmas and the cold weather .

Nick Bate and wife Ruth rushed their daughter Willow to hospital as soon as they saw blotches appear on her chest. But within an hour, she was covered with a purple rash and doctors diagnosed her with meningococcal septicaemia. Willow Bate died from meningitis just hours after her parents first noticed she had the tell-tale rash . Doctors at Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent said she was too sick to be transferred to a specialist unit at St Thomas' Hospital in London. The 'happy, smiling' little girl got weaker and weaker, her heart stopped three times and her family told she could be brain-damaged if she pulled through. Her devastated parents were forced to make the agonising decision not to revive Willow for a fourth time. She died in the early hours of last Friday morning just hours after the rash was first spotted the day before. The 'happy, smiling' toddler's heart stopped three times and her devastated parents were forced to make the agonising decision not to revive her a fourth time . Mr Bate, 36, of Gillingham, Kent, said: 'Until the rash there were no symptoms, but by then I knew it was too late. 'After her heart stopped the final time, they asked if we wanted to try again. We said ""no"". That was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.' Mrs Bate, 31, added: 'She was a happy, healthy little girl, always smiling, and that's how we all want to remember her.

Jealousy: Kyaw was slashed by two girls whom she knows because her ex-boyfriend also used to date one of the attackers. The assault took place Tuesday afternoon at the Fayette Mall in Lexington. The girls, who Kyaw said called her job beforehand to learn when she was due to arrive, waited for her and tackled her to the ground and slashed an 'X' into her left cheek. Stunning: Kyaw, seen here in one of her modelling shoots, had her face targeted. Kyaw, who also suffered bruising around her eye and nose, said no one came to her aid. 'There were others standing around, watching it happen. No one even helped me get up or told them to stop.' Kyaw, who has done some local modelling and has been recruited by a modelling firm, said the suspects targeted her face. 'All I remember is just trying to protect my head.' Initially, she said, 'I didn't feel anything, I just knew I was bleeding. 'I thought I broke my nose, I didn't think they slashed my face up like this,' she said. She said she was told her that the suspects called her job at the mall to find out what time her shift started. 'This is not a human act, its like an animal,' she said of her attackers. ' They have no right to think its okay to do this to me.It's not okay to do this to anyone.' After the assault, Kyaw ran in a panic to her job at the mall. 'I had a bleeding face. I told my manager to call 911.' Happier times: Kyaw celebrates Christmas with a pal . She was rushed to a local hospital, where doctors told her she was lucky to be alive. 'They told me if they went down a little bit more on my neck I would be dead from losing so much blood,' she said. She hopes the wounds won't leave permanent damage on her face as she hopes to pursue her passion in modelling. Recovery: Kyaw said she hopes her wounds won't leave permanent scarring. Kyaw said the attacker who previously messaged her had last written her 'about a month and a half ago. 'But I ignored her. I am not the problem type.' She broke things off with the boyfriend, saying she didn't want the hassle his ex was causing. 'I was like, 'I'm done with this drama.' Kyaw had never seen the other attacker before.

Gertrude 'Gussie' Moran, who shocked the modest midcentury tennis world when she took the court at Wimbledon with short skirt and ruffled underwear, has died at age 89. Moran had recently returned from a long hospital stay with colon cancer when she died Wednesday night in her small apartment in Los Angeles, said Jack Neworth, a tennis writer who befriended Moran in her final year. As a 25-year-old seventh seed at Wimbledon in 1949, Moran made jaws drop and flashbulbs pop at the usually staid All-England Club in London when she showed up for her first match minus the knee-length skirt considered proper for women at the time. Breaking the rules: Gertrude 'Gussie' Moran, pictured on June 22 1949 at Wimbledon when she shocked the tennis world with her daring short skirt, has died at the age of 89 . She lost the match, but her striking fashion statement appeared on magazine covers around the world, the British press dubbing her 'Gorgeous Gussie.' Image issues: Moran, pictured in 2004, would always struggle to be known for more than the skirt and the 'Gorgeous Gussie' moniker she got from the press . 'She had no idea what she was getting . into,' Neworth said. 'She definitely liked fashion and was very . attractive, but she was very naive and hadn't traveled much.' Moran was ranked as high as fourth in the United States, would be a doubles finalist at Wimbledon and reach the singles semifinals at the U.S. Open., but would always struggle to be known for more than the skirt and the 'Gorgeous Gussie' moniker she got from the British press. 'Gussie was the Anna Kournikova of . her time,' tennis great Jack Kramer said in 2002 in the Los Angeles . Times, which first reported her death. 'Gussie was a beautiful woman . with a beautiful body. If Gussie had played in the era of television, no . telling what would have happened. Because, besides everything else, . Gussie could play.' She always preferred to spell her . nickname 'Gussy,' but reporters at Wimbledon spelled it 'Gussie' and . that version stuck, at least publicly, for the rest of her life. Gertrude Agusta Moran was born in . 1923 to Harry Moran, a sound technician at Universal Studios, and his . wife Emma. They lived in a house near the ocean in Santa Monica. Moran . began taking tennis lessons at 11, and later played at Santa Monica . High and on traveling junior teams with future luminaries like Kramer . and Louise Brough. After retiring from tennis, she toured . with the USO, and was once on a helicopter that crashed in Vietnam. She . did various stints on radio and television including a sports talk show . for six years in New York. Moran married three times, resulting in an annulment and two divorces, and had no children.

'What's wrong with having a good time . with your clothes and your body? I was not very . comfortable doing so. Maybe it would be different now' Moran could have called on any number of well-off friends in the tennis world for help, but she refused. 'She was quite proud,' Neworth said. 'But she wasn't bitter.'

Conman: Aaron Beaird reportedly made $6million from his life insurance deception, pictured on Businessinsider.com . An insurance fraudster who made $6million ripping off his own family and members of his church before faking suicide is facing jail today. Father-of-three Aaron Travis Beaird, 39, from Enumclaw, Washington, targeted mostly his friends and family in the con which lasted ten years, the Seattle Post Intelligencer reports . The life insurance salesman skimmed money from what clients paid him. He then doctored documents to back up his crime and redirected the companies correspondence to a PO Box he owned. On being discovered he feigned his suicide – abandoning his car by a waterfront and sending farewell notes to all of his clients. He actually fled to Scotland for a week. Federal prosecutors say he deserves a six-year sentence for his crime. He is expected to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Ricardo Martinez later this afternoon. ‘Mr. Beaird is the worst of thieves,’ one victim said in a letter to the court, according to the newspaper. ‘He has stolen from the elderly, a widow, the blind, his family, and his wife’s family. He has stolen from trusted friends.’ ‘I considered Travis a very trusted and loyal friend and adviser,’ another woman wrote. “He took everything my husband and I worked our entire life to build. He left me broke at 61, a distraught widow.’ ‘This whole situation has been like a kick in the gut for me,’ another said in a letter. “I find that I have kind of lost the spark in my life.’ Enumclaw: The town near Seattle, pictured, was the location of a fraud carried out by Travis Beaird. He has admitted ripping off family, friends and local church members of millions. He will be sentenced today . ‘Travis Beaird is a predator,’ another victim said. “He was a personal friend, and betrayed all the trust that was given to him.’ Beaird, a church leader, also tricked members of the congregation leaving many of his backers broke and distraught – one victim has been forced to live in a trailer after losing their fortune. The college dropout managed to get away with it for a decade but pushed his luck in 2011 when he tried to collect $500,000 on a man’s life insurance by claiming he had died when he hadn’t. It was discovered by the insurance company. As the extent of Beaird’s deception became clear, the broker faked his own suicide – leaving his car abandoned near a local waterfront called Deception Pass, according to the local report. He actually took a taxi to a nearby airport and took a flight to Scotland. Deception: Beaird faked his suicide by abandoning his car at nearby Deception Pass, pictured, after sending goodbye notes to his clients. He actually traveled to Scotland for a week . He was arrested after flying back to Seattle a week later and on his return he pleaded guilty to FBI investigators. His defense lawyers claimed he invested much of the money in other businesses but his attempts fell apart when they went under. 'Unfortunately, none of the many companies he started proved successful as he lacked any real business experience and simply had too many projects going to manage them all,' defense attorney Nancy Tenney told the court. 'Mr. Beaird has lost his professional license, his business, his wife, all material assets, as well as his reputation. They are calling for a shorter prison sentence. The victims are unlikely to see their money returned as Beaird has spent around $5.7million of his stolen wealth. In a letter to court he said: 'I had everything going for me in life, such high hopes, a beautiful family and good intentions. ‘Not a day goes by that I haven’t wished I could go back and make things right.'","Aaron Beaird, 39, from Enumclaw, Seattle, defrauded family, friends and members of his church over ten years .

It’s an irresistibly adorable sight that has captured the hearts of animal-lovers ever since ‘Keith’ was first spotted having strayed inland. Adorable, that is, except for anglers who claim the seal is a threat to other fish and wildlife – and want to see it shot. All at sea: Keith the female seal is said to be confused after losing her way and swimming up the River Severn . But now Keith’s followers are fighting back to keep the seal safe with a Facebook campaign and online petition. Keith, who despite the name is . believed to be female, was first spotted in the River Severn in . November, after it had strayed more than 50 miles from its usual marine . habitat. Since then animal-lovers have followed . its journey and reports of sightings. But after Keith was snapped . eating a duck and numerous fish, the Angling Trust labelled it a ‘marine . predator’ and threatened to obtain a licence and use a qualified . marksman to shoot the mammal. Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the . Trust, said: ‘This marine predator cannot be allowed to carry on eating . its way through freshwater fish that have taken decades to grow to a . size. 'We will try everything possible to remove it humanely but more . drastic action may be the only option if these methods do not work.’ 'Marine predator': Keith the seal tucks into a freshly-caught salmon, much to the dismay of local anglers . This picture and the one above were taken by cyclist Mick Finn who spotted Keith near Diglis Locks in Worcester . Enjoying herself: Keith seems in no hurry to leave . One . angling club member even claimed Keith was a threat to pets. Stuart . Anderson said: ‘I am very worried as it has started taking ducks and . waterfowl and soon will start attacking swans and maybe dogs swimming.’ But within hours of the shooting threat emerging a Facebook campaign entitled ‘Save Keith the Seal’ was launched. By last night it had already been endorsed with more than 600 ‘likes’. Twitter was also buzzing with messages . backing Keith, while an online petition to save the seal from the . bullet had amassed well over 400 signatures. The seal was first photographed having swum upstream to Bewdley and Stourport-on-Severn in Worcestershire. There locals nicknamed it after Colonel Keith, the Royalist commander at the 1651 Battle of Worcester during the Civil War. The seal’s usual home is believed to . be in the Irish Sea or Bristol Channel. Animal-lovers will be reassured . by the response of the authorities, which suggests victory for the . campaign to save Keith. An Environment Agency spokesman said: . ‘We understand the concerns of anglers, but one animal in a large river . like the Severn is unlikely to have a significant impact on fish stocks. ‘This is natural predation and it will eventually make its way back out to sea. ‘With this is mind, and because seals are a protected species, we won’t be taking action.’ An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘It’s not uncommon for seals to venture away from the sea. ‘As long as the seal is not injured, or in any immediate danger, then we would not be concerned for its welfare.’ Keith's petition can be found at www.facebook.com/savetheseal, and the petition at http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/save-keith-the-seal.html .

Former NFL quarterback Ryan Leaf has been moved from a drug treatment center to the Montana State Prison for threatening a staff member and other unspecified behavioral problems at the center, a corrections official said Thursday. The former San Diego Chargers and Washington State Cougars quarterback was charged last spring with breaking into two houses and stealing prescription painkillers near his hometown of Great Falls, Montana. Leaf, 36, was arrested on March 30, 2012, and again in a separate incident on April 2. Back in jail: Ryan Leaf has been moved from a drug treatment center to state prison for threatening a staff member and other unspecified behavioral problems at the center, a corrections official said Thursday, January 17 . He pleaded guilty in May to reduced . charges, and his five-year sentence called for spending nine months in a . locked drug treatment facility as an alternative to prison. Leaf said then that he was looking forward to the treatment at Nexus Treatment Center in Lewistown. But on Thursday, the Montana Department of Corrections released a statement by Great Falls regional probation and parole administrator Dawn Handa that said Leaf will now serve his sentence in the Deer Lodge prison. ‘The Montana Department of Corrections terminated Leaf from the treatment program and placed him in prison after he was found guilty of behavior that violated conditions of his drug treatment program. The violations included threatening a program staff member,’ Handa said in the statement. Corrections officials did not immediately respond to a request for details of the violations or the threats. Leaf’s attorney, Kenneth Olson, did not immediately return a call for comment. Drug problems: The former star quarterback was charged last spring with breaking into two houses and stealing prescription painkillers near his hometown of Great Falls, Montana . It was unclear when the threats or other behavior issues occurred. The Department of Corrections’ website listing offenders says Leaf has been an inmate since January 10. The Great Falls Tribune first reported Leaf’s imprisonment Thursday.It was not immediately clear how the change would affect a probation violation he is facing in Texas for 2010 drug charges. Olson said in July that Randall County prosecutors had canceled their outstanding warrants so Leaf could serve his Montana sentence before facing possible penalties in Texas. Leaf was charged with stealing prescription pain medicine from a player’s home while he was a coach at West Texas A&M. An investigation also found he obtained nearly 1,000 pain pills from area pharmacies in an eight-month span. His Montana conviction is a violation of his probation, prosecutors said. Leaf was the No. 2 pick in the 1998 NFL draft, but his short-lived pro career earned him the reputation as one of the biggest busts in NFL history. Arrested: Former NFL quarterback Leaf was arrested on March 30 then again days later on burglary, theft and drug charges . An investigation began in March 2011, after Great Falls postal workers reported they were suspicious of frequent packages Leaf received by paying COD charges of $500. Central Montana Drug Task Force officers and Leaf’s parole officer confronted the former quarterback and found a container with 28 oxycodone pills inside and another container with a prescription made out to an acquaintance. The acquaintance said Leaf had entered his home without permission, and Leaf was arrested. Shortly after his release, two Cascade County residents told authorities they found Leaf inside their home. The couple reported three different prescription medications missing. Leaf was declared a fugitive earlier this year when Texan authorities issued two arrest warrants for the former star quarterback who was being sought for obtaining a controlled substance through fraud. An investigation turned up that Leaf had obtained nearly 1,000 pain pills from area pharmacies in an eight-month span. He was also charged with violating his probation. In 2010 Leaf was sentenced to . 10-year probation on drug and burglary charges. Admittance: He pleaded guilty in May to reduced charges, and his five-year sentence called for spending nine months in a locked drug treatment facility as an alternative to prison . Burn out: Leaf was the number two pick in the 1998 draft, second only to Peyton Manning . The former football pro became the No. 2 pick in the 1998 draft behind Peyton . Manning, who was scooped up by the Indianapolis colts. Blaming injuries Leaf retired at 26 in 2002. On March 30, 2012, he was arrested for possession of dangerous drugs and released after stumping up a $76,000 bail. Early on April 2 he was arrested again on burglary, theft and drug charges. Days after being released on bail Leaf was found in the living room of a mobile home by the home's owners. They later discovered that bottles of prescription drugs were missing. His probation violation charge did not carry a bond so Leaf could not be released from jail. The probation violation was related to a plea agreement Leaf made in Texas after being accused in 2009 of burglarizing a player's home while he was a quarterbacks coach for Division II West Texas A&M. Drafted: He was picked by the San Diego Chargers as the second overall pick . He released a statement through his publicist, Wendy Ogunsemore, on March 30, 2012. 'I've made some mistakes, and have no excuses,' the statement read. 'I am using the tools I've learned to move forward rather than backwards, and will be open to talking about the details in the days to come. I am confident that there will be further understanding when the facts are revealed, and feel very blessed for all of the support, especially from my friends and family.' Authorities believe Leaf may have broken into other homes over the past one and a half years in search of prescription drugs and are asking those victims to come forward. Last year, Leaf had surgery to remove a benign tumor from his brain stem and later underwent additional radiation treatments. On March 21, 2012, Leaf told an Associated Press reporter in an email exchange that he had struggled through treatments and had an MRI scheduled for the end of the month, but 'I'm doing/feeling much better and am excited for the rest of 2012.'","The former quarterback was charged last spring with .

Notre Dame football star Manti Te'o kept up the charade that his beloved girlfriend had died even after learning it was a hoax, but claims he did it for the sake of his teammates as they prepared for the national title game, it was revealed today. Te'o, whose story of losing his love, Lennay Kekua, during the season endeared him to a nation of fans, has said he found out on December 6 that Kekua in fact never even existed back when he received a phone call from 'Kekua.' But just two days later, he repeated the bogus line that his girlfriend died after battling leukemia to a website in South Bend, Indiana, where the prestigious university is based. Scroll down for video . Manti Te'o repeated the lie that his girlfriend died just two days after learning her entire existence was a hoax. He has told friends that he did to protect his teammates who were preparing for the national title. 'I mean, I don’t like cancer at all. I lost both my grandparents and my . girlfriend to cancer. So I’ve really tried to go to children’s hospitals . and see, you know, children,' the linebacker said to WSBT.com during an interview where he discussed his chances of winning the Heisman Trophy, college football's most honored award. And on December 11, Te'o told the Daily Press of Newport News, Va., on Dec. 11 why he played just days after Kekau supposedly died in September. 'She made me promise, when it happened, that I would stay and play,' he said. Te'o, who is considered a top prospect in this year's NFL draft, didn't tell school officials until December 26. He has been telling friends that he kept the shocking news to himself because he didn't want to cause a distraction as Notre Dame prepared to take on Alabama for the national championship, TMZ.com said. During the 20-day gap, Te'o, who has also said in interviews how he met Kekau in person, agonized over what to do before finally coming clean with his coaches, sources told TMZ. One of the images of 'Lennay Kekua' who supposedly died in September after battling Leukemia . Te'o says he only learned Kekau wasn't real on December 6 when he received a phone call from her cellphone, approximately three months after she died. In a press conference on Wednesday night, Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick said that Te'o was the victim of online predators who took advantage of the athlete's generosity and kindness. Swarbrick pointed to the documentary film Catfish and an MTV program of the same name in explaining how easy it can be to fool somebody into believing an online relationship is real. But journalists, including one of the reporters at Deadspin.com that broke the initial story, have called that story into question. 'It takes a great deal of faith if you’re going to believe that Manti Te’o actually spent an entire year with a girlfriend that he never met and that he never had any video chat with,' the Deadspin reporter, Timothy Burke, said on the Today show. Burke dug into Te'o's story to discover that his girlfriend never existed. He believes Te'o was in on the ruse, saying, 'it takes a great deal of faith' to think Te'o didn't know the truth. In numerous published reports, Te'o said that while this past season has brought many triumphs to his life, there were also twin tragedies - the deaths of his 72-year-old grandmother and his girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, within a day of each other. A comprehensive investigation by Deadspin.com found that while his grandmother did indeed die on September 12, 2012, Kekua did not - nor did she even exist. The school conducted its own investigation and found that Te'o had been taken for a ride by what Swarbrick calls a sophisticated hoax orchestrated by 'a remarkable number of characters - both male and female.' He said: 'It was real to Manti. There was no suspicion that it wasn’t. The pain was real, the grief was real, the affection was real - and that's the nature of this sad cruel game.' 'This is incredibly embarrassing to talk about, but over an extended period of time, I developed an emotional relationship with a woman I met online,' Te'o said in a statement. 'We maintained what I thought to be an authentic relationship by communicating frequently online and on the phone, and I grew to care deeply about her.' Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick told the media Wednesday that Te'o was the victim of an elaborate prank perpetrated by others. However, he stopped short of saying he had ever met her in person or correcting reports that said he had, though he did on numerous occasions talk about how special the relationship was to him. When she was said to be sick in the hospital, T'e'o would phone her and stay on the line with her as they slept, waking up eight hours later to find her still breathing on the other line. And it seems the joke is far from over after someone tweeted from Lennay Kekua's Twitter account late last night. Al Vaosa, who tweets under the username jayRahz, joked about her and even said he was 'running her profile' last December. He has even said on Twitter that he knew it was all a hoax back in 2008. Vaosa claims at that point that he severed all ties with Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, who is the main suspect of being the person behind Lennay Kekua, even though she did not actually exist. Tuiasosopo, left, is believed to be the main person behind the hoax. Vaosa has claimed he severed ties with him but joked on Twitter last December that he 'was running her profile.' Among the evidence collected in Notre . Dame's independent investigation was 'online chatter' that showed some . people knew about the prank and were 'taking joy in it,' Swarbrick said. Vaosa, who Tweets under the username Jayrahz, said last month that the story was a hoax. Vaosa puts the blame on the hoax on Tuiasosopo. Notre Dame athletic director has said others took pleasure in perpetuating the hoax. On the night of the BCS title game, one Twitter user, @jayRahz posted: 'I wonder if the real Lennay Kekua is watching the game.. Cause I know the fake one that didn't die is not watching over the Irish!' But despite the university's claims, there is still substantial doubt that Te'o could have been fooled so easily - and for so long. 'It’s tough for me. I want to believe that Manti Te’o is a smart kid. Playing linebacker for the University of Notre Dame requires a certain amount of smarts, and it would take a pretty, I guess, clueless guy to fall for this for that long. I guess that’s where my skepticism lies,' Burke said. And Yahoo! sports columnist Dan Wetzel said the case has 'left everyone wondering whether this was really the case of a naïve football player done wrong by friends or a fabrication that has yet to play to its conclusion.' Gregg Doyel, national columnist for CBSSports.com, was more blunt with assessment. 'Nothing about this story has been comprehensible, or logical, and that extends to what happens next,' he wrote. 'I cannot comprehend Manti Te’o saying anything that could make me believe he was a victim.'","The star Notre Dame linebacker says he found out on December 6 that Lennay Kekua did not exist .

Mathai worked for Annie George (pictured) and her late husband at their 20,000-square-foot mansion . A woman who had been charged with cheating an Indian household servant out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in pay and keeping her as a virtual prisoner at a mansion was found guilty Friday of knowingly keeping the servant in the country illegally. Annie George had said she didn't know Valsamma Mathai was in the United States illegally and that she didn’t mistreat Mathai during the 5 1/2 years she worked in her 20,000-square-foot home in suburban Rexford, near Albany. Mathai had testified that she slept in a closet, worked long days without vacation, days off or sick time and wasn't allowed to leave the property, a palatial stone mansion on a cliff overlooking the Mohawk River. George was convicted of harboring an illegal immigrant. She faces a penalty of up to 5 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. A federal jury handed down its decision Friday after deliberating since Thursday afternoon. The case surfaced when Mathai's son in India, Shiju Mathai, called the National Human Trafficking Resources Center in 2011. On Thursday, George said the tape recording of a phone call between a woman and Shiju Mathai, which prosecutors played Wednesday, wasn't her voice. She didn't say who she thought the voice belonged to.

George testified that she was left in desperate financial straits when her husband died in 2009. She said she knew nothing of his . business dealings, including the arrangement to have Mathai live with . them, because he required her to stick to her duties as his wife and . mother of their six children and severely punished her if she tried to . make any decisions in the home.

He was killed in 2009 along with his 11-year-old son and another man when their private plane crashed after takeoff. In his closing arguments, defense lawyer Mark Sacco said Annie George deferred to her husband on all decisions.

Belliss said Annie George was an intelligent woman with a graduate . degree in pharmacy who, even if she didn't directly know Valsamma . Mathai's immigration status, was smart enough to figure it out. Belliss said Annie George even took Valsamma to an immigration lawyer once, a charge George denied. Valsamma Mathai came to the United . States legally on a visa after her husband died of cancer, leaving her . the sole provider for her two sons and ailing mother. When she left the . original family she was illegal because it violated the terms of the . visa, Belliss said. A business associate testified . Wednesday that Mathai George left six hotels, all in foreclosure or . bankrupt and in poor condition. Several friends of Annie George said . when they visited it appeared Valsamma Mathai was a member of the family . rather than a servant, and George's children called her grandmother.

"By . Rachel Quigley and Nina Golgowski . PUBLISHED: . 12:53 EST, 18 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:07 EST, 18 January 2013 . The mother of late Kansas City Chief linebacker Jovan Belcher seeking custody of her son's baby who's worth more than $3million signed over custody of the child two days after the father's murder-suicide it's been revealed. Cheryl Shepherd, whose son publicly took his life along with the baby's mother’s last December, had granted 'temporary guardianship' to the mother's family despite today's ensuing fight for custody. It's that agreement, though temporary, which legal experts say severely damages Ms Shepherd's chance of winning back custody of the four-month-old, as well as the child's lucrative estate. Custody battle: Belcher is seen here with his girlfriend Kasandra Perkins, 22, and their baby daughter Zoey who with their death is at the heart of a $3million custody battle . Temporary custody: The baby's grandmother gave temporary custody of the girl to her mother's family so she could attend a funeral service for the mother in Texas, the mother and baby seen here . Zoey, who's currently living with the mother's family in Austin, Texas, was orphaned on Dec. 1 when her father killed her mother, Kasandra Perkins, at the couple’s home in suburban Kansas City. Belcher's mother had . been living with the couple for about two weeks and was in the home when . her son killed Perkins before taking his own life at the Chief's Arrowhead Stadium. Ms Shepherd received temporary custody . of Belcher's daughter soon after the shootings and filed a . petition in mid-December asking to be appointed as Zoey's guardian and . conservator of her estate, which is worth about $3 million. The letter seen signed today featuring four signatures by Ms Shepherd, Kasandra Perkins' cousin Sophie, a witness, and a notary, was to allow Zoey to attend her mother's Texas memorial service. 'I, Cheryl Shepherd, who has custody of child Zoey Michelle Belcher ... hereby grant temporary guardianship ... to Sophie Deon Perkins,' the letter obtained by the New York Post reads. 'What she’s doing is giving the maternal [family] a statement, which, in essence, says, ""I think you are capable of taking care of the child. I think you will love the child,""' top New York matrimonial lawyer Marilyn Chinitz told the Post. That's an argument Ms Shepherd of West Babylon New York will have to tackle now in court. Troubled: The murder-suicide has sparked debate in the NFL about gun ownership and the personal struggles of players . Zoey’s estate or guardian will receive more than $1 million under terms of the NFL’s collective bargaining agreement, including $108,000 annually over the next four years, $48,000 in the fifth year and $52,000 each year until she turns 18. She can keep receiving that amount until she is 23 if she attends college. - New York Lawyer Marilyn Chinitz . Earlier this month a court appointed a lawyer to protect the interests of the four-month-old. Shepherd also filed a second petition seeking to be named administrator of her son's estate. On January 11th, she sat silently . between her two attorneys in a Jackson County courtroom as probate . commissioner Daniel Wheeler addressed the petitions and ordered the appointment of a guardian ad litem - an attorney who represents the interests of minor . children. Wheeler changed the status of the . custody petition to 'contested' because Zoey's maternal grandparents and . other family members in Texas filed a petition in that state to be . Zoey's legal guardians. On Friday judges in both states held a conference call Thursday with lawyers for the two families, agreeing to dismiss the lawsuit filed in Texas by the maternal grandparents, Rebecca Anne Gonzalez and Darryl Perkins, their attorney Jon Michael Franks said. Paying respects: Hundreds of mourners memorialized Jovan Belcher at his funeral - despite his murdering the mother of his child before committing suicide . Memorial: Jovan Belcher was eulogized as a 'humble, kind young man' by his mother as his family and friends grappled with the horror of what he did . The judges determined that the custody dispute would be handled in Missouri’s Jackson County, where the baby was living at the time of her parents’ deaths and where her paternal grandmother filed a custody petition, Franks said. In addition to the well-being of the child, millions of dollars are at stake in the custody battle. A trust funded by the Hunt family, . which owns the Chiefs, along with team coaches, players, employees and . contributions from the public, will help care for the child. Also, Belcher's beneficiary will . receive $600,000 in life insurance, plus $200,000 for each credited . season – Belcher was in his fourth season at the time of his death – and . $100,000 in a retirement account. Shepherd's attorney, Gretchen Gold, . declined to answer questions after last week's hearing and said her client . didn't have any comments, either. Zoey's maternal grandparents, Rebecca . Anne Gonzalez and Darryl Perkins, and other Texas relatives have filed a . lawsuit seeking temporary custody of the girl, that her residence be in . Tarrant County, Texas, and that a guardian ad litem be appointed. A Fort Worth judge has scheduled a . January 22 hearing in that lawsuit. The other woman: Brittni Glass spent the night with Belcher before he murdered his girlfriend but has since denied the two had a sexual relationship . It is believed that the murder suicide took place after a row about whether or not Belcher was Zoey's father. His suicide was witnessed by coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli. A source told the New York Post: . '[Cheryl] believed that there was an issue over whether [Belcher] was . the father. She said he believed he wasn’t necessarily the father of . the child.' A Kansas City law-enforcement source confirmed: 'She told police there was a question about the paternity.' The . source added: 'The implication was that paternity was what the two of . them were fighting about — that the baby might not have been his.' The couple had been receiving counseling for relationship and financial problems, police said. A spokeswoman said she would not comment on the doubts raised over baby Zoey's paternity. It also emerged last month that the NFL player . had a secret girlfriend - Brittni Glass - who he allegedly told he would shoot Perkins 'if . she didn't leave him alone'. Belcher is also believed to have had . drinks and dinner with her before he arrived home, shot his . girlfriend after a blazing row, and then ended his own life. Details of the Belcher case are contained in police reports submitted to the Jackson County prosecutor, who has ruled the event a murder-suicide. They include dozens of interviews with witnesses. Glass has denied the two were in a relationship. Glass, also 22, told police that Belcher complained about Perkins threatening to take all his money and the baby if they broke up. He said Perkins 'knew exactly how to press his buttons and make him angry,' according to a summary of the woman's interview with police. Belcher had been with the woman and some of her friends at a downtown Kansas City entertainment district the night before the shooting, the woman said. He spent part of the night in her apartment and part of it sleeping in his car before going home early in the morning, the report said. He and Perkins were arguing before he shot her, his mother, Cheryl Shepherd, told police. Shepherd had moved in with the couple two weeks earlier to help care for the baby. Shepherd heard Belcher say 'You won't talk to me that way' and then she heard a thump and gunshots. Shepherd rushed into the bedroom and found Perkins lying on the bathroom floor, she told police. Before fleeing the house, Belcher knelt next to Perkins, apologized and repeatedly kissed her, his daughter and his mother, Shepherd said. Belcher drove off in his Bentley to . the practice facility at Arrowhead several miles away, where he pulled . into the parking lot and saw Pioli, the report said. Pioli quoted Belcher as saying, 'I . did it, I killed her.' Belcher held a handgun to his own head. 'I got to . go, can't be here, and take care of my daughter,' Pioli recalled . Belcher saying. He had asked to speak with Crennel . and linebacker coach Gary Gibbs, the report said. Crennel told police he . pleaded with Belcher to put down the gun. One witness said she heard . Crennel say, 'you're taking the easy way out'. Belcher lowered the gun, but only to load a round into the chamber, Crennel told police. Seeing a police officer in the distance and hearing sirens, Belcher knelt behind a mini-van, blessed himself and fired the gun into his temple, the report said.","Cheryl Shepherd, mother of NFL linebacker, granted temporary custody of son's child to mother's family .

The worst motorists drive on Tuesdays in September, between six and nine in the morning, according to a new stusy on the causes of road rage. And the worst offenders are people who weave in and out of traffic and cut people up. Researchers from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Canada analysed 5,624 complaints made over an eight-year period on community site Roadragers.com. There are more incidents of road rage on Tuesdays in September, according to research from Canada. Weaving in and out of traffic, cutting people up, speeding and making rude hand gestures are among the most common complaints . This site is no longer live, but others including Driver-Ratings.com and PlateWire can also be used to post road rage complaints. All the complaints analysed for the study were made by drivers in North America. The research team, led by Dr. Christine Wickens, coded each complaint for 16 specific behaviours. Top 10 worst road rage offences: . Weaving/Cutting (25 per cent) Speeding (13 per cent) Hostile display (11.7 per cent) Tailgating (11.4 per cent) Lane usage (6.5 per cent) No turn signal (6.3 per cent) Erratic braking (5.5 per cent) Traffic signs/signals (4.16 per cent) Blocking (4.14 per cent) Violent display (3.7 per cent) These behaviours included weaving and cutting, speeding, driving too close, hostile and violent behaviour, driving too slow, using mobile phones while driving, not indicating properly, and more. Most complaints contained more than one of these types of behaviour. 'Hostile driver display' included swearing and rude hand gestures. These behaviours appeared in more than 11 per cent of all complaints. This put it third in the list of most annoying incidents, just behind speeding. Violent display included physical and threatening behaviour. This was listed as chasing, getting out of the car to argue, waving a gun or weapon, and throwing objects. There were 421 examples of this type of behaviour found in multiple complaints. Wickens also looked at how many complaints were made on each day of the week. Plus, the total number of complaints made in each month of the year. The most road rage incidents happen on a Tuesday. The most peaceful day on the road is Sunday . Tuesday had the most complaints with 984, compared to Sunday with the lowest with 425. The worst month for road rage incidents was September. The most relaxed month to drive was June. As you might expect, the worst time to drive was at rush hour during the morning, with evening rush hour coming in second. Drivers in September reported more road rage incidents than in any other month. June was the best month to be on the road . And there were 108 complaints made about drivers between the hours of midnight and three am. According to the study, aggressive driving is said to be the cause of half of all car accidents in the US. The researchers plan to use the study’s findings about the worst driving offences, and how often they happen, to teach new drivers about road crimes and how to avoid them.","Canadian study discovers the best and worst days to drive .

The California camp ranger carjacked by ex-cop turned fugitive Christopher Dorner last month has filed a lawsuit seeking claim to the entire $1.2 million reward leading to his capture. Rick Heltebrake, who was robbed at gunpoint by Dorner while driving on a Big Bear-area road last month, has filed his suit against the city of Los Angeles claiming that it was his 911 phone call that led to Dorner's cornering. The full-time Boy Scouts ranger's life was spared during that carjacking while allowed to safely exit his truck and later call 911. Responsibility: Boy Scouts Ranger Rick Heltebrake, seen left, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles for the rights to the $1.2 million reward offered for the capture of Christopher Dorner, right . According to his claim, it was that call that ultimately led to police cornering Dorner three days later in a nearby cabin. 'Mr Heltebrake immediately recognized this man as Christopher Dorner,' his attorney Allen L Thomas wrote in the claim filed on February 19 and obtained by the Los Angeles Times. 'Mr. Heltebrake's telephone call to Deputy [Paul] Franklin notified law enforcement of Mr. Dorner's location, provided a description of the vehicle he was fleeing in and was the substantial factor in the capture of Mr. Dorner at the cabin location,' his attorney wrote. 'Consequently, Mr. Heltebrake accepts the mayor's offer of the entire reward of $1.2 million,' he adds. A couple kidnapped by Dorner in their . rental apartment but who later managed to escape and call 911 reporting . him to authorities just before Mr Heltebrake are said by some to be . also entitled to the reward. That's a claim Mr Heltebrake previously acknowledged while saying he'd be fine splitting it three ways. Hero call? Mr Heltebrake says that after he was carjacked by Dorner with his dog, seen, his 911 call ultimately led to Dorner's cornering inside a nearby cabin . Remains: The burnt out cabin near Angelus Oaks, California is seen one day after the fugitive ex-cop killed himself inside before taking his fourth victim of a responding officer . Still, he said at the time to a reporter: 'Someone owes me $1 million.' The reward money is believed to be the largest ever offered locally thanks to the outpouring of more than two-dozen donations to catch the man who was ultimately accused of taking the lives for four people including two police officers. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck has said that the recipient of the reward money will be decided according to the completion of their investigation. Arguments over word technicalities used in advertising the reward have recently suggested that no one will get the money at all, with Dorner having not been captured and convicted. ‘Our personal hope is that the reward will be distributed, but we must follow the rules and respect the procedures of each entity,’ officials said.","Boy Scouts Camp Ranger Rick Heltebrake was carjacked at gunpoint by Christopher Dorner before alerting authorities of Dorner's location .

A second former U.S. speedskater is now accusing Olympic medalist and former U.S. Speedskating president Andy Gabel of sexual abuse saying he raped her when she was 15. Nikki Meyer, known as Nikki Ziegelmeyer when skating short track for the U.S. in the 1992 and `94 Olympics, today joins former speedskater Bridie Farrell's claims of sexual abuse by the then president while aged 15. Both women say Gabel, a four-time Olympian who won a silver medal in Lillehammer, aggressively approached them in the 90s while training for the Olympics. In Meyer’s case it led to non-consensual sex, she told the Associated Press on Friday. Accusers: Former short track speedskater Nikki Ziegelmeyer, seen left in 1994, and Bridie Farrell have accused Olympic medalist and former U.S. Speedskating president Andy Gabel of sexual contact when 15 . Resigned: Andy Gabel has resigned from his positions with the U.S. speedskating committee and offered a public apology after the first allegations of sexual abuse arose . Meyer, who retired from skating after injuring herself in 1997, won a relay silver medal at the Albertville Games and a bronze in the same Lillehammer event as Gabel. On Monday Gabel stepped down from his speedskating position and his leadership role with the International Skating Union after Farrell's shocking accusations last week. Farrell said Gabel was 33 at the time of their sexual relationship. She was just 15. Responding to her accusations Gabel issued an apology in a public statement saying he ‘displayed poor judgment in a brief and inappropriate relationship with a female teammate,’ according to the The Saratogian newspaper in Saratoga Springs, NY. Gabel did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment. Farrell told public radio station WUWM in Milwaukee that she had sexual contact with Gabel repeatedly over several months in 1997 and 1998 while both were training in New York and Michigan. Abuse? Bridie Farrell, seen last week, said that she had sexual contact with Gabel repeatedly over several months in 1997 and 1998 while both were training in New York and Michigan . Farrell recently returned to speedskating after a six-year absence and is making a long-shot bid for a spot on the U.S. team that will compete at the Sochi Games next year. She failed in three previous bids to qualify for the Olympics. The national governing body had said that it was not previously aware of any allegations against Gabel until Meyer's on Friday. 'Our current understanding is that it was not reported to anyone at U.S. Speedskating or the authorities at that time,' the organization said in a statement. 'We intend to look into this matter immediately to determine what action should be taken.' Farrell's lawyer, Jon Little, said the abuse began when Farrell and Gabel were training at the same club in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. According to Little, Gabel began paying a lot of attention to Farrell. He would let her drive his car, for instance, and he also sharpened her skates. 'She's star struck,' Little said, describing her state of mind at the time. Regret: 'I wish I had said something the day that it happened,' Farrell said. 'And if that person didn't believe me, that I told somebody else, and somebody else, until someone listened' There was no immediate comment from the ISU. But International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said, 'Clearly, any allegations of such a serious nature need to be fully investigated.' In any event, they represent another setback to a powerhouse U.S. Olympic sport, coming after a sexual abuse scandal in swimming. Dozens of coaches have been accused of abusing underage swimmers, including a former national team director, prompting USA Swimming to adopt a 'safe sport' program and go public with a list of everyone who has received a lifetime ban from the organization. Farrell's allegations are somewhat different in that the abuse allegedly began while she and Gabel were both still competing. But Little said it follows much the same pattern of what happened in swimming: a mentorlike figure taking advantage of a young athlete. The statute of limitations for a lawsuit has expired, Little said, so there are no plans to pursue legal action. Champion: Andy Gabel (center) is a four-time, short track speedskating U.S. Olympian and holds a silver medal as a member of the 1994 5000 meter Short Track relay team . He said Farrell decided to come . forward because she wants to change the culture of Olympic sports in the . U.S., something he described as a 'good old boys network.' 'They . see their coaches sleeping with girls,' Little said. 'When they become a . coach. ... (they) get access to sexual relationships with young, fit . teenage girls – and it's just part of the culture. Everybody thinks . that's OK.' In her interview with WUWM, Farrell said she knew from the beginning that her relationship with Gabel was inappropriate. 'I knew that because he made it be a secret,' she said. 'But I will say that the 15-year-old thought it was exciting.' Farrell said she didn't tell anyone what had happened for years. 'The first five to seven years after it happened, I was scared,' she told the radio station. 'I was petrified, because I was young and in speedskating, and I was knocking on the door to the junior national team, then the senior national team, and I didn't want to do anything to jeopardize that. Hopes: Farrell (circled) recently returned to speedskating after a six-year absence and is making a long-shot bid for a spot on the U.S. team that will compete at the 2014 Games.

'Then,' she added, 'there was a period of my life when I didn't say anything because I realized I was hurt, and I was broken. 'And it took a long time and a lot of work and some pretty dark times to come to grips with it and put myself together.' 'I wanted to be close and real with friends in skating, but there was this big secret and there was this big part I wasn't disclosing,' she said. 'And in order for me to be honest and truly be friends with these people, I needed to be able to say, ""This is a huge thing I'm battling.""' Farrell said her biggest regret is waiting so long to come forward. 'I wish I had said something the day that it happened,' she said. 'And if that person didn't believe me, that I told somebody else, and somebody else, until someone listened.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 06:33 EST, 9 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:51 EST, 9 March 2013 . Home Secretary Theresa May delivered a major speech which ranged far beyond her law and order brief, setting out how the Tories can win the next election . The Conservative party must shake off its reputation for being on the side 'just of those who have already made it', Theresa May warned today amid warnings just seven per cent of Tories think David Cameron can win the next election outright. In a highly unusual speech ranging far beyond her law and order brief, the Home Secretary insisted the party could secure victory but only if it becomes 'the home of those who want to work hard and get on in life'. The major address at a conference organised by party activists comes amid growing speculation that Mrs May has her sights set on becoming Tory leader if Mr Cameron fails to win an overall majority. It is likely to cement her reputation as a possible leader in waiting, and will delight Tory backbenchers who want the party to reconnect with blue-collar workers. Damning polling released to coincide with today's conference showed that three-quarters of Tory supporters think Labour’s Ed Miliband will be the next Prime Minister. In the comprehensive speech covering trade, banking, industrial . strategy, welfare, prisons, trade unions, education and training, car . manufacturing and the NHS, Mrs May repeatedly stressed Mr Cameron was the right leader for the party and had what it takes to be Premier. But she stressed that the Conservatives needed to give people a voice, and offer them security from crime, foreign threats and everyday risks like losing their job or illness. 'We have a good record and we have the right team.  But those advantages alone will not be enough,' she told the ConservativeHome Victory 2015 conference in central London. 'We have to become the party that is tireless in confronting vested interests, the party that takes power from the elites and gives it to the people, the party not just of those who have already made it, but the home of those who want to work hard and get on in life.' The comments will be seen as an attempt to help the Tories shed the image of being party of the elite, with opponents focussing on the privileged backgrounds of Mr Cameron and George Osborne. Mrs May looked unimpressed in the Commons this week when Ed Miliband joked about her leadership ambitions . Mrs May added: 'We need to offer them security, not . just from crime and foreign threats, but from everyday risks like . falling ill, or losing your job. 'We . need to promise them freedom, not just from the state but from vested . interests like unions, big bureaucracy and, yes, big business. 'And we need to give them opportunity, by reforming capitalism and making sure our economy works for all of us.' Mrs May said the Tory party could be an 'unstoppable force' but only if if occupies the common ground, is tough on crime and immigration and reforms public service reforms and the economy. 'By standing up for the people, by taking on anybody who gets in the way, by confronting vested interests wherever we find them, we will change the country for the better.  And we will win the next general election.' The number of Tory members who think David Cameron win a majority in 2015 has slumped from 23 last March to just seven per cent now . Hopes of a Tory, or even playing a part in government, seem to be fading, according to a survey of more than 1,800 Tory members by ConservativeHome . Mr Cameron is under increasing pressure to reassure the party that he has a plan to win the next election, after failing to defeat the scandal-hit Lib Dems in Eastleigh. With the party still reeling from being . beaten by the UK Independence Party in Eastleigh, Tory planning minister . Nick Boles, an arch-moderniser, said he had been ‘thoroughly p***** . off’ by the ‘truly rotten campaign’. Tory rebels claim his leadership could be pushed into crisis within weeks if the Budget fails to deliver and the party suffers a drubbing in May’s local elections. Amid rumours of Cabinet ministers jostling for position, as MPs consider life after Mr Cameron, Tories said they were braced for the loss of hundreds of seats in the May polls. Several Tory MPs have put the Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne on notice that this month’s Budget must prove to be a ‘game-changer’ which tackles the rising cost of living and gets the economy moving. But with barely two years until the general election, it seems many Tory activists have given up hope of victory. Since March the proportion of Tory members who think the party can win an outright majority in 2015 has collapsed from 23 per cent to just seven per cent. According to a survey of 1,844 Tory party members for grassroots website ConservativeHome, almost a third (31 per cent) think Labour will win an outright majority, nine per cent believe Mr Miliband will form a minority Labour government and a further 34 per cent expect a Labour coalition with the Lib Dems. Changing places: More Tories now think Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) will be Prime Minister after 2015 than Mr Cameron . Eight per cent predict a new coalition between the Tories and Lib Dems, while the remaining 11 per cent expect Mr Cameron to fall short of a majority but will lead a Tory minority government. Two thirds (62 per cent) think the hardest task facing the party is stemming the loss of support to the UK Independence Party while 29 per cent believe trying to defeat sitting Lib Dem MPs to be the toughest challenge. Tim Montgomerie, editor of ConservativeHome, said: 'Tory members are NOT saying that exposing Labour is a less important task than stopping defections to UKIP. Planning minister Nick Boles said he was 'thoroughly p***** off' by the party's campaign in Eastleigh . 'My hunch is that they are answering the specific question. 'They worry that while the British people may be very open to believing that Ed Miliband isn't the right choice for these tough economic times they are worried that a large number of normally Tory-minded voters are going to choose UKIP over the Conservatives and it's going to be difficult to win them back. 'A 6 per cent to 7 oer cent showing for UKIP at the next general election won't produce a single MP for Nigel Farage but it may be enough to prevent Cameron from winning an overall majority. 'Key to Tory thinking is that if the election is framed as a straight Cameron versus Miliband choice then many UKIP voters will prefer the Conservatives to Labour.' The rise of UKIP has spooked Tory strategists, who are planning to launch a detailed attack on the anti-EU party’s policies in the coming weeks. However Mr Boles, who was a key advisor to Mr Cameron during the early days of his leadership, warned against a lurch to the right. In a frank assessment of the party’s ability to win back voters, Mr Boles said the Tories failed to offer voters any hope in Eastleigh and repeated the same mistakes it has been making for more than a decade. Mr Boles told The Times last week's Hampshire by-election had been a ‘truly rotten campaign’. The planning minister said: ‘Where was the hope? It was as if modernisation had never happened. ‘We screwed it up. We didn't even screw up in a new way. We screwed it up in an old way that we have been doing for a decade. It's so frustrating.’ But Mr Boles, an ally of the Prime Minister's, warned plotters they needed ‘their head seeing to’ if they believed it was wise to attempt to oust Mr Cameron. A separate poll by former Tory donor, Lord Ashcroft, suggests the Tories would lose 93 seats to Labour in an election tomorrow. The survey of more than 19,000 voters in 213 constituencies suggests a swing from the Tories to Labour of around 8 per cent in the most marginal Conservative seats. It predicts the Lib Dems would lose 17 seats to the Tories in England and Wales and 13 seats to Labour. Launching the poll at the Conservative Home 'Victory 2015' conference in London, Lord Ashcroft said: ‘I don't want to see a Labour majority of 4, let alone 84. But I hope this puts the challenge into some sort of perspective. ‘We have a long way to go to hold onto the seats we gained last time, let alone pick up many more. But things are slightly less grim than the headline polls suggest, and we have everything to play for.’","Home Secretary makes extraordinary wide-ranging speech setting out how the Tories must change .

For many travelers, taking pictures is simply part of the experience, but for one frequent flier, his trip almost didn't happen after taking a photo on board his plane. Matthew Klint, 26, who has racked up nearly a million air miles, was settling into his business class seat from Newark to Istanbul. Excited after being upgraded, Mr Klint decided to blog about the experience and started clicking away with his iphone. Little did he know he had broken one of United's rules. Welcome Aboard: But don't take any pictures please! A business class blogger was asked to leave his flight after taking a photo from his seat before takeoff . After taking a picture of the empty seat in front of him, a fight attendant ran over and told him he couldn't take a picture and was escorted from the plane. Writing about the experience in his travel blog, Mr Klint says he was told the taking of pictures violates United's policy. The policy appears in the in-flight magazine: . The use of still and video cameras, film or digital, including any cellular or other devices that have this capability, is permitted only for recording personal events. Photography or audio or video recording of other customers without their express prior consent is strictly prohibited. Also, unauthorized photography or audio or video recording of airline personnel, aircraft equipment or procedures is always prohibited. Any photography (video or still) or voice or audio recording or transmission while on any United Airlines aircraft is strictly prohibited, except to the extent specifically permitted by United Airlines. Determined not to be forced from his flight to Turkey Mr Klint begged the flight attendant to let him stay: 'Look, I am a traveler. I am not a terrorist, I write about airline stuff all the time. Here is one of my business cards,' he told her. It made no difference. A few moments later he was dragged from the plane by one of the gate agents passing the Captain on the way. 'The Captain was quite rude, and he says, essentially, ‘I don’t want to hear you, get off the plane before I call the police.’ Upgraded then offloaded: Matthew Klint, 26, joked to a flight attendant that he was a blogger and not a terrorist. It didn't go down well with the Captain who threatened to call police unless he left the plane . 'There were whispers throughout the business class and Economy Plus cabins as I made the walk of shame down the aisle,' Klint wrote on his blog. He called the incident 'traumatizing and highly embarrassing.' Agents at Newark airport rebooked him onto another flight that left 45 minutes later but it wasn't until he had written about the experience on his blog that management from United Airlines reached out to him. They offered him what he describes as some modest compensation for the disruption to his travel plans. No explanation: United rebooked Mr Klint on another flight but have not explained their reasons for removing him from his flight. They say customers can take pictures on board so long as it respects the security and privacy of other customers . United have not commented on why Mr Klint was removed from the aircraft but instead have told Mr Klint that an 'extensive internal investigation' is underway. They have also provided a statement about their policy: . We welcome customers to record their personal experiences on board provided they don’t take photos or videos of customers and crew members without their consent. This is both a security and service measure we take that also respects the privacy of other customers. Mr Klint has admitted it wasn't his smartest moment to use the word 'terrorist' on the plane, but he says he doesn't want anyone else to experience inconvenience and embarrassment that he has had to endure.","Blogger Matthew Klint has almost a million air miles but it wasn't enough to keep him on his a flight to Turkey .

'You only have one life and you should make the most of it. If I could save one life, then I will know I have done my job.It will make me feel amazing.' The bionic suit was developed by Ekso Bionics in Berkeley, California, and was the first real alternative for paraplegics in terms of mobility since the invention of the wheelchair. Just like with bicycles and skis, users have to learn how to make the Ekso,which cost around £100,000 each, work for them.

But in six months' time the orange tabby has shed a remarkable seven pounds while additionally taken into the permanent home and care of his veterinarian, Brittney Barton of Dallas. In a newly released photo of the tabby seen lounging around Dr. Barton’s home - as well as affectionately in her arms - she reports that Skinny is doing well while on a special diet to help lose weight and increase his metabolism. Check me out: Seen lounging in his new home in Dallas, Texas on Friday, Skinny the former 41-pound cat poses for pictures in his new 34-pound body . Dr Barton says she became attached to the cat - that weighed as much as an average 5-year-old child according to U.S. government growth charts - while treating him at an animal orphanage. Last month, after a campaign to find Skinny a new home, he became part of her family. Skinny now joins Dr Barton's husband, three children, a dog and another cat at her Dallas home. Barton says Skinny gets along great with the other animals, can jump up on a couch and runs - not waddles - to his food bag at feeding time.

A motorist left stunned when he was prosecuted for accidentally splashing a police worker when he drove along a flooded road has finally won his seven-month legal battle. Mick Davidson, 60, was driving his Volkswagen down Cheshunt High Street, Herts., last June when he went past PCSO Richard Moore. Days later a PCSO and a police officer turned up at his home claiming he had been driving in a careless or inconsiderate manner - a criminal offence. Stunned: Van driver Mick Davidson, 60, from Puckeridge, Herts., couldn't believe it when he was prosecuted for accidentally splashing a PCSO when he drove down a flooded road . Mr Moore accused him of drenching him with a 'six foot high wall of water' by deliberately driving through a 10ft by 3ft puddle. Enraged Mr Davidson was told to either go on a driving awareness course or face prosecution - and he decided to fight his corner, insisting the officer was telling a 'pack of lies'. He spent weeks gathering his own evidence to prove that no such puddle could have existed. The case got as far as the magistrates court but the Crown Prosecution Service suddenly dropped it as the trial was about to start - admitting their evidence was 'irregular'. Mr Davidson, from Puckeridge, Herts., said: 'This police officer and PCSO came to my home and showed me a piece of paper saying I had been driving and careless or inconsiderate manner. 'I told them 'you're joking' but they went ahead. 'I wrote them a long letter saying I couldn't guarantee turning up to the driving awareness course because of health issues. 'They then decided to take me to court and at that point I saw the PC and the PCSO's witness statement. 'I was so incensed by how incorrect it was. I wasn't having none of it. It was a complete pack of lies. 'I'm not the kind of person who goes about looking for a copper to splash. 'I have never denied that the road was flooded. And I have never denied that I could have accidentally splashed the PCSO. 'But there is no way there was one puddle of those exact measurements on the road. The whole road was puddles.' Legal battle: Mr Davidson fought for seven months against the police and disproved their claim he deliberately drove through a puddle . Stevenage magistrates were told the statements of PCSO Moore and a Turkish witness were similar - including identical spelling mistakes. The witness used an interpreter, but the court found there was no interpreter's signature on the original statement and dropped the case. Mr Davidson says he has received no apology from the police, who he blasted for wasting time and money on the case. He said: 'They expected me to cave in, but I refused to give up. I went back to where it happened five times to gather information. 'I cannot believe we went all the way to court over a puddle. What a waste of money and time. The police should be putting their resources in to solving real crimes.' Hertfordshire Constabulary said PCSO Moore was no longer employed by the force and that the case was still 'being reviewed'. It is understood that Mr Moore is now training to become an officer with Cambridgeshire police. The Crown Prosecution Service said: 'On the day of the trial, an irregularity with the recording of evidence by the police became apparent, which meant that the trial could no longer proceed. 'The CPS offered no evidence and the case was dismissed.'","Mick Davidson, 60, from Puckeridge, Herts., accused of drenching officer .

In a rather subdued start to what is dubbed the world’s ‘Last Great Race,’ 66 teams of sled dogs and their mushers ceremoniously strolled eleven miles down Anchorage streets Saturday, officially starting the Iditarod, Alaska’s grueling 1,000-mile-plus race. Sunday’s ‘re-start’ marks the actual, competitive start of the race. At 2pm, 50 miles north in Willow, 65 teams of the original 66 will begin the 41st running of the race. Fun start: Alaska's famous Iditarod had its ceremonial start in Anchorage March 2 as adoring fans greeted mushers like Matt Failor (center) Adoring fans: The 41-year-old race begins slowly, on trucked in snow on city streets while the real challenge begins 50 miles away in Willow, Alaska . Ed Stielstra of Michigan, this year's sole musher from from east of the Rocky Mountains, dropped out of the race after the ceremonial start due to injuries he sustained while training in February. Today, mushers will leave the adoring crowds behind in favor of remote terrain shared mostly with their dogs. Teams posed, Sunday, with fans and sailed their sleds on streets covered with trucked-in snow. Each sled carried an Iditarider, a fan who won the short ride at auction. Lucky puppies: After greeting fans, elite teams of 16 thrilled dogs will race over 1,000 miles to the frontier town of Nome, Alaska . 'Fun, with a capital F,' a smiling veteran musher Aliy Zirkle, the runner-up in last year's race, said Saturday. 'If you don't have a good time on Saturday with your dogs and all these fans, you're not in the right sport.'

Big deal: The Iditarod is the premier event in dog sledding and attracts competitors from as far as New Zealand, where these pups are from . The rest of the $600,000 purse will be split between the next 29 mushers to cross the finish line. Participants include six past Iditarod winners, including Seavey and his father, Mitch Seavey. Dallas Seavey also is among six past winners of the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race, held just weeks before the Iditarod. Big bucks: Contestant 60,Cindy Abbott, is one of 65 mushers vying to win a new truck and $50,400 along along with Iditarod glory . Lance Mackey of Fairbanks - the only musher to ever win both races the same year - just scratched from the Quest in February because of a team of ailing dogs.

The 67-year-old founder of the company that bears his name arrived on American soil from Guatemala in December after spending months on the run from authorities in Belize. Until last fall, the technology titan had been living in the Central American nation, but fled after police sought to question McAfee in connection with the killing of his neighbor, a fellow American expat. New home: John McAfee, the illusive and eccentric antivirus software mogul-turned-fugitive, arrived in Portland, Oregon, where he plans to stay for the next 18 months . Fleeing from the authorities, McAfee went into hiding, but continued blogging about his unfolding adventure, detailing how he had faked a heart attack and used disguises to elude his pursuers. Shortly after crossing into Guatemala with the help of a decoy, as he wrote in his blog last month, McAfee was detained and deported to Miami. During a 12-minute interview with CNBC on December 14, the software mogul media . said he has not done drugs in 30 years, but if he did, he has ‘the . resources to do good drugs’ and not bath salts, which he said were for . ‘people that don’t have a lot of money.’ He told ABC News the same week that he was left with no money or valuable property after playing the 'crazy card' and faking an illness in Guatemala to avoid being sent back to Belize. On January 9, the international man of mystery unexpectedly appeared in Portland, posing with strippers at Mary’s Club during a photo-shoot organized by a British paper. McAfee later set down for an interview with the local publication Willamette Week, revealing that he plans to spend the next year and a half working with a local artist, Chad Essley, to create a graphic novel about his life. In the spotlight: McAfee is interviewed while posing for photographers outside the Beacon Hotel in Miami Beach . This is just the latest bizarre development in the McAfee saga. This week, The Hollywood Reporter . revealed that Warner Brothers will be making a movie about the oddball . software pioneer, and has secured the rights to a profile of him that . was published in Wired Magazine last year. John . Requa and Glen Ficarra, the duo behind the 2011 hit comedy Crazy, . Stupid Love starring Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling, will write and . direct the adaptation. While . speaking to reporters in Portland, McAfee, who at one point was worth . as much as $100million, shared some of his unusual ideas about money. ‘What . you want to do with your money that you get is cling on to it and own . it, and money doesn't want it,’ he said. ‘Money is the free flow . movement of energy called capital, and if you're just a vacant hole, . money will flow through you like crazy.' When . asked by his interviewers what will he do if he becomes destitute, the . 67-year-old who already had claimed to be poor, was unfazed. Back in the U.S.: John McAfee talks to the media last week outside the boutique Beacon Hotel in Miami . Dressed to the nines: McAfee walks out of the Beacon Hotel in Miami on Thursday. He said U.S. authorities have made no efforts to question him since he arrived . ‘I'm . an open hole and money will flow through me, I promise you, it always . has,’ McAfee said. ‘And when I lose it, it's fine; it's money's . business, not my business.’ The . amorous fugitive, who famously blogged about living with eight . prostitutes, also had some unusual things to say on the subject of sex. ‘I . found that the more ugly the woman, the better the sex,’ McAfee . offered. ‘The best sex in the world in the librarian who hasn't had a . date in 10 years but has read all he love books.’ These . latest insights into the mind of the quixotic antivirus innovator . should come as no surprise to those who have been following McAfee’s . ordeal.

When Jasmine was born 14-weeks early following her mother's five-day labour she weighed just 2lb 2oz. Doctors immediately took the child from her mother after the birth and frantically tried to resuscitate her at the hospital bedside as they struggled to find a heartbeat. Miss Aiken was only able to hold her daughter for the first time four-days later. Doing well: Having already suffered a miscarriage two months before falling pregnant with Jasmine, Miss Aiken was terrified that she was going to lose her child after going into labour so early . Recalling the ordeal, Miss Aiken, from High Barnes, Sunderland, said: 'I asked a doctor if she would make it and he said he honestly didn't know whether she would.' She added: 'She was so very fragile that she couldn't be moved for the first few days, all she could do was hold my finger. 'When she was stronger I was able to hold her once a day and those moments were so precious.' Born on July 10 last year, doctors soon realised that Jasmine had an open duct in her heart that eventually closed without the need for surgery. After spending the first 11 weeks of . her life in hospital, the youngster was finally well enough to go home. However, she remains on oxygen to help with the chronic lung disease she now suffers from after being born before her lungs could properly develop. Miss Aiken said that her daughter's name means 'gift from God', adding: 'We really think she is'. Now weighing 12lb 3oz, Jasmine's mother and father Simon Burnikell are determined to . help the Sunderland Royal hospital ward that saved her life. Miss Aiken, a support worker for the North East Autism Society, said: 'Without the neonatal unit, Jasmine would not be here. 'The work they do is amazing. If it hadn't been for the technology they use and the fabulous work of the nurses and doctors, Jasmine would not have been here had she been born 10 years ago. Jasmine has also inspired Humbledon Methodist Church to choose the unit as its charity for the year.","Jill Aitken went into labour after 26 weeks fearing she would lose her child .

The Liberal Democrats will block further cuts to welfare unless David Cameron drops his opposition to to stripping rich pensioners of their benefits. Nick Clegg warned David Cameron that any additional raid on Britain's vast benefits bill must 'start' with reducing handouts like the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes for well-off over-65s. The intervention comes after Business Secretary Vince Cable said health and foreign aid should not be protected from spending cuts. Nick Clegg addressed delegates during a Q&A session at the party's annual conference in Brighton . Many faces: Mr Clegg was very animated during a Q&A session with delegates in Brighton . Mr Clegg defended benefits cuts during a heated Q&A session with activists at the Lib Dem spring conference in Brighton. He challenged Defence Secretary Philip Hammond to find savings from his own budget instead of demanding general cuts to welfare. Mr Clegg said: 'Philip Hammond is making his case for his own department and is slightly scouring the Whitehall landscape to find what he considers to be the easy alternative to a lot of what are undoubtedly difficult decisions which need to be taken in relation to the Ministry of Defence.' The Lib Dem leader insisted he was not opposed to further cuts. 'If you want to revisit welfare then let’s at least start with the people at the top. Vince Cable receives a bus pass in Twickenham; he doesn’t feel he needs it. 'Why are we giving – Vince isn’t a millionaire – but why are we giving these universal no-questions-asked benefits to millionaire pensioners when people on much lower incomes are having their support from the benefits system cut or curtailed. 'And the Conservatives don’t want to do that. So they don’t even in their great enthusiasm for welfare reform, let’s go after welfare; go after welfare, even when they want to do that they won’t start at the top and work down.' Mr Clegg earlier met young activists and new Lib Dem MP Mike Thorrnton . Mr Clegg went on: 'There is real difference there and I have made clear to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor: The Liberal Democrats are not averse to welfare reform, we have done a lot, and we have just to £3.5billion in welfare savings in the last autumn statement . 'But if you want to do more you have got to do it fairly, you have got to show that you are prepared to start at the top and work down.' Earlier Mr Cable claimed further . cuts to his Business department would damage science and universities, as he . repeated his call for extra spending on big infrastructure projects to . kickstart the economy. And he launched an outstpoken attack on Tories demanding deeper spending cuts as waging 'ideological jihad' against public services. Business Secretary Vince Cable has questioned whether health, schools and defence spending should be protected from cuts . The Cabinet is embroiled in a growing public row about the need for further spending cuts in 2015-16, beyond the next general election. Chancellor George Osborne has privately made clear he is relaxed about minister ‘fighting it out among themselves’ over where the axe should fall. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Theresa May are among the Tory ministers resisting more cuts to their budgets. But Mr Cable is seen as the ‘shop steward’ of the so-called National Union of Ministers preparing to defy the Treasury. In his fringe appearance last night, Mr Cable he said there would be 'pressure on public spending' for years to come. And in an strongly-worded attack on the Tories, he added: 'What . we have to make absolutely clear is that there is a difference between . managing public spending, controlling public spending in that context - . having that financial discipline - and the kind of thing that a lot of . right-wing Conservatives are wishing for, which is a kind of British Tea . Party,' he said. 'A kind of ideological jihad against public spending and public services.' Mr Clegg applauds during a rally to mark International Women's Day, which was dominated by party angst over its handling of the allegations against Lord Rennard . In an interview ahead of the Lib Dem . spring conference in Brighton, Mr Cable warned serious damage will be . done to British industry if the coalition continues to spare some . departments from any cuts. David . Cameron promised real terms increase in health funding and the defence . equipment and schools budgets will be protected post-2015. The coalition . has also committed to increase foreign aid to 0.7 per cent of GDP. Mr Cable insisted he is not ‘sticking his head in the sand’ but is angry that so many areas have been protected. Former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown said he did not want the party being in government to be a 'blip' in its history. In a rousing speech as the head of the party's election campaign said he wanted being in power to become a 'habit'. And he told activists: 'You know, I'm sure that you, like me, have often told children and grandchildren that it's not the winning that matters, it's the taking part. 'Well let me let you into a little secret. That's b******.' He added: 'Liberals have waited a hundred years for May 2010. 'And I dreamt every hour of my leadership of our party, that one day we would have the opportunity to be where we are now, in government; making a difference.' He told the Guardian: . ‘In opposition I did not think that was a sensible way to approach . public spending. I have gone along with it in government in coalition, . as part of the team and all that, and we did that in the first wave of . public spending cuts.’ Mr Cable warned he will block further cuts to his Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. ‘We have delivered in the first spending round big spending cuts – not too many people give us credit for it but the administrative cuts have been 50 per cent. ‘We have lost a lot of civil servants – it is a much more efficient department. We have done 'brave things' in quotes like student fees, privatising the Royal Mail – radical things – but we have now got to the point where further significant cuts would do enormous damage to things that really do matter, like science and skills and innovation and universities. ‘Obviously, that is not very sensible given that the overall objective of the government is to achieve extra growth. 'I am always up for efficiency and quite brave reforms, so I am not just sticking my head in the sand, but you get to a point where the kind of cuts that are being considered will do serious damage to things that are essential for growth and the industrial strategy. I think we know there are large, alarming sums being sought.’ His criticism of the decision to international development from cuts comes as it emerged foreign aid is to be diverted through British companies to prevent it falling into the hands of corrupt and wasteful regimes. Firms will use the money to win infrastructure contracts and boost struggling economies in Africa, Latin America and Asia. The radical move, to be announced by International Development Secretary Justine Greening next week, is being seen as a victory for common sense in the bitter controversy over the £11billion international development budget, which has been ringfenced while other departments face cuts. The Lib Dems gather in Brighton for their spring conference hoping to celebrate their victory in last week's Eastleigh by-election. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg hopes to use the spring conference to draw a line under a run of scandals . But the party has been dogged by . questions about its handling of groping allegations against former chief . executive Lord Rennard and Chris Huhne's conviction for perverting the . course of justice. Senior . party figures including Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam have been forced . to deny being told by Mr Huhne's estranged wife Vicky Pryce that he . forced her to take speeding points for him. The . Lib Dems hope to use the gathering to distance themselves from the . Tories, and Mr Cable has questioned Mr Osborne's focus on spending cuts . to balance the nation's books, arguing more could be raised from taxes. 'The proposals for the one-year spending review, as we understand it, is for 85 per cent spending cuts versus 15% tax rises. Certainly as a Liberal Democrat I would question that.' And he defied David Cameron's insistence that pensioner benefits like the winter fuel allowance should be protected from cuts. The 69-yearold said: 'I have been getting the winter fuel payment for five years, it has been keeping me warm in Twickenham. I actually give it away. 'If we are in the realm of tough choices, why did we feel that this area is a sacred cow?'","Vince Cable questions decision to protect some areas from austerity .

"By . Lucy Buckland . UPDATED: . 10:35 EST, 15 November 2011 . Hunted: An artist's impression shows a primitive Yeti emerging from a cave . Hunters are claiming they have discovered the nest of a legendary Yeti tucked away in a remote area of Russia. And experts are hailing the discovery of bizarrely twisted trees in the Kemerovo region as the final piece in the puzzle to prove the abominable snowman is real. Experts stumbled across the trees, twisted by force to form an arch, in the area -which is known for sightings of the wildman. And Yeti experts who met at a conference in Moscow to discuss the find mounted an exhibition to Siberia to see the nest for themselves. Biologist John Bindernagel, 69, told The Sun, 'We didn't feel like the trees we saw in Siberia had been done by a man or another mammal. 'Twisted trees like this have also been observed in North America and they could fit in with the theory that Bigfoot makes nests.' Sightings of the Yeti have been reported in France, North America and the Himalayas but Dr Bindernagel said these are mainly ignored by scientists who are put off by 'jokes and taboos.' He told The Sun: 'I am nearly 70 so time is running out for me.' The latest discovery comes a month after Russian officials said they found ‘indisputable evidence’ that yetis exist. Their claim followed an international conference and expedition to track down the Abominable Snowman in the Mount Shoria area. However, doubt was already been cast over the ‘find’ – as the team has no convincing photographic or DNA evidence. Their claim appears to be based a single unclear footprint and a small sample of grey ‘hair’, found in a cave. The administration of the Kemerovo region, where the cave is situated, yesterday announced that ‘indisputable evidence’ had been found. But critics said the expedition was more about making the area a tourist destination than true science. Evidence: Vladimir Makouta, head of Siberia's Tastagol district administration, and the sheriff of the area's Kabyrza settlement, show twisted aspen branches believed to have been caused by a Yeti . Made by a legend? Experts say these arches prove a Yeti has been trawling the region and had nested nearby . On the trail: this strange footprint found in the snow was also hailed as proof the Yeti exists . Researchers who led the search said that they are closer than ever to catching one the creatures. 'During . the expedition to the Azasskaya cave, conference participants gathered . indisputable proof that the Shoria mountains are inhabited by the Snow . Man,' the Kemerovo region administration announced yesterday. 'They found his footprints, his supposed bed, and various markers with which the Yeti uses to denote his territory.' The . markers appeared to be mainly broken trees and some Russian media . reports have treated the Yeti claims with considerable scepticism. Despite . this, the local government officials professed themselves either . certain or 95 per cent certain of the existence of Yeti in a highland . area known as Mount Shoria. The hair thought to be from a Yeti was found in the Kemerovo region 2,600 miles east of Moscow . The . first accounts of Yetis emerged before the 19th century from Buddhists . who believed that the creature inhabited the Himalayas. They . depicted the mysterious beast as having similarities to an ape and . carrying a large stone as a weapon while making a whistling sound. Popular . interest in creature gathered pace in early 20th century as tourists . began making their own trips to the region to try and capture the Yeti. They reported seeing strange markings in the snow. The . Daily Mail led a trip called the the Snowman Expedition in 1954 to . Everest. During the trip mountaineering leader John Angelo Jackson . photographed ancient paintings of Yetis and large footprints in the . snow. A number of hair . samples were also found that were believed to have come from a Yeti . scalp. British . mountaineer Don Whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature when . scaling Annapurna in 1970. An American housewife told a previous conference she regularly feeds Yeti in her back garden in Michigan but was unable to produce a single photograph of an elusive creature rumoured to exist for thousands of years. One cynical Russian media report summed up the mission as 'we haven't actually found anything, but we very, very much wanted to have found something'. Shortly before the 'experts' arrived, another hunt to the same cave to find the Yeti was led by the 'Beast of the East' - former Russian heavyweight boxing champion Nikolai Valuyev. It ended in failure, though locals saw it as a key plank in the region's bid to boost tourism. 'Valuyev did not manage to meet the Yeti itself but on the way he discovered 'traces' such as broken tree branches,' said a spokesman. 'I saw lots of journalists but no Yetis,' admitted the boxer. Dmitry Islamov, Vice Governor of Kemerovo Region on Economics and Regional Development said: 'It doesn't matter that the Kuzbass might not have Yetis. The main thing is that when people come to the Shoria Mountains, they truly enjoy its unique nature.'",Twisted branches found in Kemerovo region could finally prove Yeti is no longer the stuff of legends .

A two-year-old boy from Colorado vacationing with his family in Mexico was sexually assaulted and beaten by his babysitter's intoxicated boyfriend before being tossed in the pool to drown, it was revealed today. Police in Mexico have arrested Eleodoro Carlos Rodriguez Sanchez, 30, and charged him with sexual assault and murder of Axel Charrette. According to local reports, Sanchez, who also goes by the name Carlos Roberto Tapia Sanchez and the alias 'El Cholo,' made a statement to detectives confessing to the crime that took place in the village of Sayulita February 28. Horror: Eleodoro Carlos 'El Cholo' Rodriguez Sanchez, left, reportedly confessed to sexually assaulting and throwing Axel Charrette in the pool; Nancy Saralee Solorio Pérez, right, allegedly did nothing to stop the murder . Confession: Solorio Perez (third left) told police she hid inside the house for a few minutes after seeing Sanchez (second left) enter through the garage, and when she went to check on the kids, she found Axel's naked body in the pool . Officials also arrested Sanchez's . former girlfriend, 16-year-old Nancy Saralee Solorio Perez, who was . babysitting two-year-old Axel and his seven-year-old brother, Kalden, . while the boys' parents were away. Solorio Perez has been charged with murder because officials say she hid in the house and did nothing to stop Axel's killing, and then lied about it to police. In a statement released to The Watch News, . Axel's parents, Jen and Randy Charrette, wrote that the teenager, whom . they hired along with her mother to look after their two children while . the family were on a three-month vacation in Mexico, let her boyfriend . come onto the property. This version of events was later . confirmed by Solorio Perez's statement to police. According to local . reports, the caretaker said that on February 28, her 30-year-old . boyfriend came onto the property of Jen and Randy Charrette's rental . home through a garage door. The 16-year-old noticed that Sanchez . was high on drugs and appeared aggressive, so she locked herself in a . bathroom 'for a few minutes.' When the baby sitter went outside to check on the kids, she came across Axel's naked body in the swimming pool, The Denver Post reported. The boy was rushed to the hospital in . San Pancho, where doctors determined that he had been beaten and . sexually abused before being thrown in the pool and left to drown. Axle's older brother was playing in another part of the house at the time of the tragedy and was left unharmed. The parents were out of the house . when Solorio Perez's ex-boyfriend entered, attacked Axel and drowned . him, the prosecutor's office said. The prosecutor's office said Solorio Perez reported being too terrified to alert police during the crime. The Charrettes have been told by a source in the US State Department that the case is 'Mexico's number one priority right now.' Angel: Axel Charrette, age two, was attacked and left to drown in a pool while on a three-month vacation with his family in Mexico . Family adventure: Jen and Randy Charrette, and their two sons, Kalden, bottom left, and Axel, headed down to Mexico in early January on what was supposed to be an extended vacation . In a statement released to MailOnline Wednesday morning, an official with the State Department confirmed the death of Axel Charrette, adding that the agency extends its deepest condolences to his family and friends. The statement goes on to say that the US consulate in Guadalajara and the consular agent in Puerto Vallarta have been in contact with the Charrettes and are providing assistance. The Mexican Consulate General of Denver issued a statement saying, ‘On behalf of the government of Mexico we express our deepest condolences to the Charrette family.’ Consulate spokesman Jorge Lizcano said that authorities in the state of Nayarit will investigate and prosecute the case ‘to its final consequences under Mexican law.’ Axel's father, Randy, owns Peak to Peak Bicycles in Ridgeway, The Denver Post wrote. His wife, Jen, is a software engineer and competitive bike racer. The Charrettes arrived in Sayulita January 4 and were expected to stay there through March, enjoying an extended winter vacation. The family returned Monday to their hometown of Ridgeway - a tight-knit community of 900 in Colorado that has rallied around the grief-stricken family. Family spokesman Brian Scranton said the Charrettes were overwhelmed by the support from residents of the town, . who had set up an assistance fund, created a website for neighbors to . sign up to bring meals to the grieving family and opened their homes to . relatives coming to support the family. Since the Charrettes have always been avid biking enthusiasts, the town is naming a bike trail after the slain boy, Scranton said. ‘There's something amazing about it,’ he said. ‘Whatever they need, it's been given to them without question.’ Home away from home: The Charrettes rented this house in Sayulita, Mexico, not far from the resort town of Puerto Vallarta, for three months from a Canadian landlord . Tragic death: The parents wrote in a statement that their 16-year-old baby sitter's boyfriend came onto their property while high on drugs, hurt Axel and threw him into this pool, leaving the child to drown . In a statement, Jen Charrette said . her family had received ‘a moment of peace’ during ‘a loving ceremony by . some beyond amazing people and family that have been loving angels.’ The grieving mother expressed her . appreciation to be ‘coming home to more love’ and asked the community to . keep her family in their hearts. In their public statement cited by Ouraynews.com, the . Charrettes wrote: ‘There are no words to express our grief—but we wanted . you to know what happened because the truth, as horrible as it may be, . is important. ‘Thank you for all your support and everything you have done and continue to do.’ Jen Charrette has been writing a blog called Velo Mom, where she has been carefully documenting their exploits and travels. According to the blog, the Charrettes left their home in Colorado in early January and headed to Sayulita near the resort of Puerto Vallarta, where they had rented a home for three months from a Canadian landlord. In the statement to The Watch, the parents mentioned that it was their landlord who helped them hire a local woman as a housekeeper and her 16-year-old daughter as a babysitter to look after their children. The horrific killing of their toddler son came about two months into their planned eight-month vacation. On the blog, Jen Charrette wrote that her husband and their kids decided as a family to rent their home in Ridgeway, sell off most of their possessions, pack the rest into their truck and go on an adventure south of the border. To finance their travels, the Charrettes have been working remotely using the Internet, cutting their expenses, and they also have been home-schooling their two boys. Modern family: The Charrettes, who are avid biking enthusiasts, sold off most of their possessions, rented their home in Colorado for eight months and headed down to Mexico to spend time with their two boys riding bikes and surfing . ‘We did not win the lottery or even have a huge savings to devote to travel,’ Mrs Charrette wrote on her blog. ‘We are just putting experiences and time together before a big house and all the comforts of home.’ The family arrived in Sayulita on January 4 after a two-day trip by car, and they had planned to stay there for three months before switching to another locale in Mexico, or making heading back to the U.S. For the past two months, the Charrettes have been spending their time in Mexico surfing, biking, exploring the jungle and learning Spanish. Just days before Axel’s death, Jen Charrette wrote on her blog that her older son, Kalden, came down with what appeared to be a stomach bug that required a brief hospitalization. Around the same time, their 13-year-old dog was attacked by a German Shepherd.

The row over fatcat pay was reignited yesterday as it emerged that more than 500 bankers at Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland scooped more than £1million last year. The ‘rampant inequality’ at both lenders was laid bare for the first time, with Barclays revealing that more than 70,000 staff are languishing on less than £25,000. In another day of shame for British lenders, RBS – 82 per cent owned by the taxpayer – said it awarded 95 staff packages of at least £1million, despite slumping to a £5.2billion loss last year. One mystery banker was paid more than £5million, while embattled boss Stephen Hester was handed a multi-year package worth up to £3.2million. This compares with an average RBS pay package of £34,000. RBS sneaked out the details late yesterday afternoon, hours after Barclays confirmed that there were 428 staff in its  ‘millionaires’ club’. Its chief executive Antony Jenkins received a package worth £2.6million, despite forfeiting his annual bonus. Barclays confirmed that Jenkins’s predecessor Bob Diamond is in line for £2.4million in pay and perks in July – a year after he quit in disgrace over the interest rate rigging scandal. Diamond also amassed a treasure chest of shares worth more than £40million during his 16 years at the bank. Both lenders provided more information on their bumper pay packages than ever before in their annual reports in an effort to become more transparent. Barclays said it has 393 ‘code staff’ – executives involved in risk-taking   – who were paid an average of £1.3million. At RBS the 368 ‘code staff’ were on an average of £701,000. Critics said the huge packages highlighted the yawning pay gap between frontline staff and top executives. Payouts: RBS said it awarded 95 staff packages of at least £1million, despite slumping to a £5.2billion loss last year . Commenting on Barclays, Dominic Hook, of trade union Unite, said: ‘This is a bank that has been at the centre of some of the worst recent scandals in the City, such as Libor, and there should be no reward for failure at the top of the organisation. ‘The rampant inequality in the pay between the top Barclay executives and those on the frontline who deal directly with customers is shocking and needs to be addressed by the chief executive as a matter of urgency.’ Deborah Hargreaves, of the High Pay Centre, said it ‘has to be bad for morale and productivity’ that ‘hundreds of staff are paid more than frontline staff will earn in a lifetime’. Both Barclays and RBS are fighting to restore their reputations. Barclays was fined £290million for rigging crucial interest rates and has set aside £1.6billion to compensate customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance. But despite efforts to show restraint, its pay packages remain much more generous than rival lenders. Although the number of Barclays staff in the ‘millionaire’s club’ has fallen to 428 from 473 last year, it is still more than twice the number at HSBC, despite having just over half the number of employees. Barclays has 145,000 staff while HSBC has around 260,000.","Rampant inequality as 70,000 Barclays staff are revealed to be languishing on less than £25,000 ."

Conservationists scored a major victory over the wind farm lobby yesterday after plans to build giant turbines near one of the nation’s finest surviving Elizabethan gardens were halted. A High Court judge ruled preserving historic settings was of greater importance than renewable energy targets. Mrs Justice Lang said the bid to build four 430ft high turbines on farmland owned by the Queen’s cousin the Duke of Gloucester was legally flawed. How the wind farm may have looked.... She ruled the planning inspector had failed to ‘accord ‘special weight’ or considerable importance to ‘the desirability of preserving the setting’, and said the case must now be reconsidered in light of her judgement. The case, which was brought by the National Trust and English Heritage, alongside East Northamptonshire Council, was hailed as a significant victory by conservationists, who had warned approval would undermine protection of other historic sites. The giant turbines at Barnwell Manor, would have overshadowed the historic gardens at Lyveden New Bield in Northamptonshire. It is described as one of England’s oldest garden landscapes and features an unfinished 17th-century Tudor garden lodge, ‘steeped in Catholic symbolism’. National Trust director of conservation Peter Nixon, said: ‘Of course we are pleased. The National Trust’s mission is to preserve what is very special to so many people. It is a huge judgement in favour of conserving of our historic landscapes.’ The charity is currently opposing or monitoring around 25 applications for wind farms due to concerns over their impact on the surrounding countryside or heritage sites. Out the window: Prince Richard, the Duke of Gloucester, will now NOT have a wind farm built on his land . Mr Nixon said yesterday’s ruling would strengthen the Trust’s hand when it came to future opposition.‘It sends an important signal that area of outstanding beauty or national significance need protecting and are unsuitable for these types of developments,’ he said. ‘Although it is not a legal precedent, this can only help in the context of preservation.’ Earlier this week, the Trust’s chairman Sir Simon Jenkins said communities were complaining on an almost daily basis of a wind farm or housing development proposed in a sensitive landscape.He said that far from stimulating the economy, the reforms ‘will produce not more housing, but more conflict’ and spark ‘warfare’ in Britain’s countryside. Plans for the Barnwell Manor wind farm were rejected by the district council in the first instance in 2010, after strong local opposition. But the developers appealed and in March last year public inquiry inspector Paul Griffiths allowed its construction. The inspector said he recognised the case had wide implications for listed buildings and conservation areas, but said the Government’s green targets - to produce 15 per cent of energy from renewable sources by 2020 - must come first. Yesterday, Mrs Justice Lang ruled the inspector had failed to ‘properly interpret and apply the relevant planning policies on the effect of development on the setting of heritage sites’ and quashed the decision.

But Maf Smith, deputy chief executive RenewableUK, which represents the wind farm industry, said: ‘It would be wrong to suggest that any kind of precedent has been set on this occasion, as each wind farm application is considered on a case-by-case basis. ‘The fact that this application went to the High Court shows that, at times, decisions are finely balanced and difficult to reach.’","Plans to build 'energy farm' on land owned by the Duke of Gloucester thrown out .

Threat: Accused gunman James Holmes, pictured, was held in restraints at a psychiatric hospital last November after jail officials determined he was a threat to himself . Accused Aurora, Colorado movie theater gunman James Holmes was held in restraints at a psychiatric hospital last November after jail officials determined he was a threat to himself. Holmes' lawyers revealed the days-long stay in court filings made public on Friday in an effort to have a videotape of his hospitalization turned over to them by the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office, which runs the jail where he is being held without bond. But Arapahoe County District Judge William Sylvester ordered the sheriff's office to keep the footage 'pending further order of the court.' The court filings were made public on the same day that Sylvester rejected a motion by defense attorneys to declare Colorado's insanity defense law unconstitutional. Holmes, 25, is scheduled to enter a plea in the case on Tuesday. Holmes is charged with multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder in the July shooting rampage that killed 12 moviegoers and wounded 58 others during a screening of 'The Dark Knight Rises' Batman movie in Aurora. Defense lawyers said in the motion that Arapahoe County attorneys not involved with the prosecution asked a judge on November 15, 2012, to transfer Holmes to a hospital because he was a danger to himself and in 'immediate need of a psychiatric evaluation.' That same day, Holmes was transported . by ambulance from the jail to Denver Health Medical Center's . psychiatric unit 'where he remained for several days, frequently in . restraints,' the motion said. Psychiatric unit: Holmes' lawyers revealed the days-long stay at Denver Health's psychiatric unit, pictured, in court filings made public on Friday . That hospitalization, defense lawyers noted, was separate from an earlier incident where Holmes was treated at a hospital for injuries 'that resulted from potential self-inflicted head injuries in his cell.' The motion said the sheriff's office refused to give the video to prosecutors or defense attorneys at the direction of Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson. Robinson told Reuters on Friday night that he had released a 'relevant video to both sides,' but citing a gag order imposed by the judge in the case, declined to comment on its contents. Robinson said his office had been 'straightforward and cooperative' in the case, and that he would not release the hospital video because it was taken outside his jurisdiction. In the dock: Colorado shooter James . Holmes appears confused while making his first court appearance at the . Arapahoe County on July 23 . Memorial: Tributes are left for victims near the scene of the tragedy in Colorado that claimed 12 lives . 'I told them (attorneys) that I didn't . have the authority to give them that video because it was taken in . Denver and they'd have to go through them,' he said. In rejecting the defense motion to declare Colorado's insanity defense law unconstitutional, Sylvester said defense lawyers had raised the issue prematurely since Holmes had yet to enter a plea, and prosecutors had not indicated whether they would seek the death penalty. Lawyers for Holmes last week challenged the constitutionality of a Colorado statute that requires a defendant who raises an insanity defense to submit to examinations by court-appointed psychiatrists. Defense lawyers argued that the law, which would compel Holmes to provide potentially damaging information that could be used against him at trial, or at sentencing should he be convicted, violated his Fifth Amendment guarantee of protection against self-incrimination.","James Holmes, 25, was held in restraints at Denver Health's psychiatric unit after jail officials determined he .

Surgically removing deep fat from around the waist could reduce obese women's risk of bowel cancer, a study suggests. Obese people with an oversized waistline have a higher chance of developing bowel cancer, but the results of a U.S. study indicated that the risk was reduced in women who had visceral fat removed from around the waist. Dieting, which had little effect on visceral or abdominal fat - that which accumulates around the organs - did not remove the risk, the study found. 'Pot belly': The surgical removal of visceral fat from around the waist reduces obese women's risk of developing intestinal tumours, a study suggests . In contrast, calorie restriction had a significant effect on intestinal tumours in men, but removal of visceral fat did not. An excess of visceral fat results in individuals developing a protruding abdomen, often described as a 'pot' or 'beer' belly. Obesity has long been closely linked to many cancers. The study saw a team from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York set out to examine the role of visceral fat in mice genetically prone to developing colon cancer. Risk: Researchers say they have proved that too much abdominal fat actually causes the disease, rather than the habits that fuel obesity . Researcher Dr Derek Huffman said: 'There has been some scepticism as to whether obesity per se is a bona fide cancer risk factor, rather than the habits that fuel it, including a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. 'Although those other lifestyle choices play a role, this study unequivocally demonstrates that visceral adiposity is causally linked to intestinal cancer.' The study randomly assigned the mice to one of three groups. Mice in the first group underwent a sham surgery and were allowed to eat an unrestricted 'buffet style' diet, for the entirety of the study, which resulted in these mice becoming obese. Those in the second group were also provided an unrestricted diet and became obese, but they had their visceral fat surgically removed at the outset of the study. Mice in the third group also underwent a sham surgery, but were provided only 60 per cent of the calories consumed by the other mice in order to reduce their visceral fat by dieting. Dr Huffman said: 'Our sham-operated obese mice had the most visceral fat, developed the greatest number of intestinal tumours, and had the worst overall survival. 'However, mice that had less visceral fat, either by surgical removal or a calorie-restricted diet, had a reduction in the number of intestinal tumours. This was particularly remarkable in the case of our group where visceral fat was surgically removed, because these mice were still obese, they just had very little abdominal fat.' The researchers then subdivided the groups by gender. In female mice, the removal of visceral fat was significantly related to a reduction in intestinal tumours, but calorie restriction was not. In male mice, calorie restriction had a significant effect on intestinal tumours, but removal of visceral fat did not. He added: 'This suggests that there are important gender differences in how adiposity and nutrients interact with the tumour environment. In addition, the study emphasizes the need to promote strategies that reduce visceral fat in abdominally obese individuals.' The team said more studies were needed to uncover the mechanisms behind the causality between visceral fat and intestinal cancer, to determine how abdominal obesity and nutrient availability act independently during the stages of tumour promotion and progression, and to determine how other strategies to promote weight loss, such as bariatric surgery, affect cancer risk. The findings are published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research.","Dieting did not reduce the bowel cancer risk, the U.S. study found .

From the lavish invites and a plush location to a show-stopping dress and decadent cake, weddings don't come cheap. But one cash-strapped bride-to-be is so desperate to tie the knot that she has resorted to selling advertising space - on her wedding dress. Stacy Burnett, 29, and her partner Daniel Webb, 28, had their hearts set on getting married this year but can not afford their wedding even at a cut price. Stacy Burnett and her partner Daniel Webb are looking for people to sponsor their wedding. Cash-strapped Stacey is so desperate to tie the knot she is selling advertising space on her dress . Smitten Stacy had bought her wedding dress in anticipation of booking their nuptials but rising costs meant they had to put their plans on hold. But now, in a desperate bid to plow ahead with their big day, the couple are looking for sponsors. Imaginative Stacy says she is even prepared for her dress and her fiance's bridal outfit to be covered in logos and adverts if it helps them bring in the funds they need. The couple, who met two years ago, say they are happy to sit down and discuss ideas with the individual businesses about how they can advertise the services they provide them with on the day. Mother-of-one Stacy, from Sittingbourne, Kent, said they didn't want anything 'big and fancy' but they hoped companies would back their idea. She said: 'I started planning eagerly last year but due to the economic climate it's all had to be put on hold for the foreseeable future. The couple say they are happy to sit down and discuss ideas with the individual businesses about how they can advertise the services they provide them with on the day . 'My fiance works full time and we have even moved in with my parents so that we can save. 'We want a church wedding because it's a bit more traditional, but with church fees, venue fees, catering, rings, suits, DJ even for the most basic of weddings, it just wasn't possible for us to do it this year. 'We don't want a big fancy wedding but even the most basic of packages is too expensive. 'Doing everything on a budget we reckon it will still cost between £3,000 and £5,500. 'While some couples might not want to get married in 2013 because they're a little superstitious we'd love to get married this year - after all, we just want to say ""I do"". 'We would even be willing to have any advertising for any companies that would be kind enough to help us out. 'We'd be willing to talk about signs on my dress and the back of suits, all we'd ask is that they could be removed for photographs.'. And Stacy isn't alone in offering herself up for sponsorship. In japan some women are renting out their bare legs for companies to market their products in . return for payment.

A candidate indicted for crimes against humanity has been declared winner of Kenya's presidential election today by just 8,400 votes. Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Kenya's founding president, faces trial after the disputed 2007 presidential vote that unleashed a wave of tribal blood-letting. With the 51-year-old in the top job, Kenya will become the second African country after Sudan to have a sitting president indicted by the International Criminal Court.

Supporters of Uhuru Kenyatta celebrate outside the media center of Jubilee Alliance in Nairobi . Kenya's presidential candidate Uhuru Kenyatta was declared the fourth president after gaining 50.07 per cent of total votes . Opposition leader, Prime Minister Raila Odinga, responded by saying 'democracy is on trial' in the country. The U.S. and other Western powers, big donors to the east African nation, said before the vote that a Kenyatta win would complicate diplomatic ties with a nation viewed as a vital ally in the regional battle against militant Islam. After saying Kenyatta secured 50.07 per cent of the votes, just achieving the more than 50 per cent needed to avoid a second round, the chairman of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, Issack Hassan, announced: 'I therefore declare Uhuru Kenyatta the duly elected president of the Republic of Kenya.' Shortly afterwards he handed a certificate of the results to Kenyatta, who had arrived after the declartion. Kenyatta thanked him. Many in the election centre cheered, although celebrations started in the early hours of Saturday after provisional results showed Kenyatta's victory. Supporters thronged the streets of Nairobi and his tribal strongholds, lighting fluorescent flares and waving tree branches and chanting 'Uhuru, Uhuru'.

The mood was tense but calm in the heartlands of Kenyatta's rival, Odinga, who also lost in the disputed 2007 vote and trailed this time with 43.3 per cent. 'No Raila, no peace,' Odinga supporters chanted as security forces stood by in Kisumu, a city where violence flared in 2007. Speaking before the formal declaration, a close adviser to Odinga said his candidate would challenge the result if Kenyatta was declared winner. 'He is not conceding the election,' Salim Lone told Reuters, speaking on behalf of Odinga. 'If Uhuru Kenyatta is announced president-elect then he will move to the courts immediately.' Odinga's camp had said during tallying that the ballot count was deeply flawed and had called for it to be halted. But they promised to pursue any disputes in the courts not the streets. The election commission, plagued by technical problems that slowed the count, took five days to announce the result.

Demonstrators chant slogans as tension arises after Uhuru Kenyatta was declared winner of Kenya's presidential election . International observers broadly said the vote and count had been transparent so far and the electoral commission, which replaced an old, discredited body, promised a credible vote. Kenyatta achieved the 50 per cent mark by a tiny margin of about 8,400 votes out of the more than 12.3 million that were cast. Both sides relied heavily on their ethnic groups in a nation where tribal loyalties mostly trump ideology at the ballot box. Kenyatta is a Kikuyu, the biggest of Kenya's many tribes, Odinga is a Luo. Both had running mates from other tribes. John Githongo, a former senior government official-turned-whistleblower, urged the rival coalitions, Odinga's CORD and Kenyatta's Jubilee, to ensure calm. 'Jubilee and CORD, what you and your supporters say now determines continued peace and stability in Kenya. We are watching you!' he said on Twitter. How Western capitals deal with Kenya under Kenyatta and the extent they would be ready to work with his government will depend heavily on whether Kenyatta and his running mate William Ruto, who is also indicted, cooperate with the tribunal. Guests read a newspaper at the ceremony held at the National Election Center where final election results were announced . 'It won't be a headache as long as he cooperates with the ICC,' said one Western diplomat. 'We respect the decision of the majority of the Kenyan voters.' Both Kenyatta and Ruto deny the charges and have said they will work to clear their names, though Kenyatta had to fend off jibes during the campaign by Odinga that he would have to run government by Skype from The Hague. 'Until now, Kenyatta has been cooperating with the court and we do hope this will continue,' said Fadi El-Abdallah, spokesman for the Hague-based court. 'This is part of Kenya respecting its legal obligations under international law.' Kenyans hope the vote, which has so far passed off with only pockets of unrest on voting day, would restore their nation's reputation as one of Africa's most stable democracies after killings last time left more than 1,200 dead. Many Kenyans have said they are determined to avoid a repeat of the post-2007 chaos that brought the economy to a halt. Church leaders in Kisumu, in the west of Kenya that was devastated five years ago, sought to defuse tension this time. Uhuru Kenyatta after being officially announced as winner of the presidential election . 'Our vote was stolen and we're angry,' said Denis Onyango, a 28-year-old mechanic, as hundreds of Odinga supporters gathered with members of the security forces nearby. 'Why did they bring such huge security here if the vote was to be free and fair.' Some said it was time to move on. 'I urge our candidate to forget the presidency and let the will of God prevail,' said cloth vendor Diana Ndonga. Many shops stayed closed as a precaution in the port city of Mombasa, another Odinga stronghold, but streets were calm. 'We are heading for a bleak future where the economy goes down and international relation sour because of the ICC case,' said Athumani Yeya, 45, a teacher in the city. Others were hopeful that Kenyatta could bring change. 'We are celebrating. Even with the ICC case in Holland, the people of Kenya still have faith in him,' said Thomas Gitau, 25, a bare-foot car washer on a main Mombasa street. 'We hope he can fix infrastructure and security so we have more jobs.' Odinga's camp had said even before the result that they were considering a court challenge. In 2007, he said the courts could not be trusted to handle the case. Kenyatta's camp had also complained about counting delays and other aspects of the vote. But many Kenyans said this race was more transparent. Turnout reached 86 per cent of the 14.3 million eligible voters. Commenting on the results, the UK's Minister for Africa, Marks Simmonds, said: 'I congratulate the Kenyan people for the peaceful and determined spirit in which Monday’s elections were conducted. 'Kenyans have expressed their sovereign will, and I congratulate all the candidates who have been successful. 'This is a historic moment for Kenya, when the Kenyan people have come together at the ballot box to achieve the promise of the new constitution and choose their future leaders. 'I urge all sides to show patience and restraint, to accept defeat or take any disputes to the courts. I am confident that any disputes will be dealt with by the courts swiftly and fairly. I appeal to all parties to maintain the same peaceful and democratic spirit that we have witnessed so far. 'The UK greatly values its deep and historic partnership with Kenya, and will continue to work in support of stability, security, development and prosperity.'","Uhuru Kenyatta faces trial after the disputed .

A Venezuelan-owned oil company caused outrage this week after flying flags at half-mast at its American office after the death of Hugo Chavez. Citgo, which is owned by the Venezuelan government, lowered its flags as a tribute to the late President, incensing residents in Houston, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana, who said they were offended by the gesture. Protocol allows flags to be lowered for foreign dignitaries, but Chavez was a controversial leader who as was antagonistic towards the U.S. Jarring: The Citgo flags at half mast to honor President Hugo Chavez in Houston, Texas . Protocol allows flags to be lowered for foreign dignitaries, but Hugo Chavez was a contentious leader and often seen as antagonistic towards the U.S. in particular. James Post, an assistant project manager at an engineering and construction firm, told Fox News that it was 'jarring' and 'deeply disappointing'. Post said that his mind 'immediately jumped to the last time we did this in the Houston-area and it was for Neil Armstrong.' Controversial leader: The late Venezuelan Vice President Hugo Chavez . Terry Backhaus, a financial adviser in Louisiana, said that the flags at the Citgo refinery in Lake Charles had been raised back by noon. 'I think I used a profanity when I saw it this morning, I was disgusted,' Bakhaus said. 'I didn't believe it to be right, not for somebody who wasn't a true American ally.' At one point Mr Chavez even blamed the U.S. government for his cancer. Chavez suggested in 2011 that the U.S. might have 'invented technology to spread cancer', and warned other left-wing heads of state that they could be targeted next. His comments came after Argentina's Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner became the fifth South American president to contract the disease. Chavez's anti-American sentiment culminated in a particularly ill-judged joke when president of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to visit Venezuela last year. Ahmadinejad and Chavez mocked the U.S. and joked about directing 'a big atomic bomb' at Washington. Courting Ahmadinejad was part of an overriding policy of befriending rivals of the United States throughout his 14-year rule. Iran, with whom he had close ties, immediately declared a day of mourning for its former ally who 'loathed U.S imperialism'. Citgo released a statement saying that Chavez 'leaves behind a legacy of support for the underprivileged and promotion of social justice that transcends geographical boundaries.' They did not explain the flag lowering . directly but said: 'We at CITGO Petroleum Corporation are deeply . saddened by the news of his passing.' 'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the people of Venezuela in this time of grief.' One of his final pictures: Hugo Chavez, centre, with his daughters, Maria Gabriela, left, and Rosa Virginia on February 14 this year when his health was already in rapid decline . Mourning in Caracas: Crowds gathered in the streets to honour late Venezuelan President, Hugo Chavez . Chavez, who was 58, died after a two-year cancer battle that has been shrouded in secrecy. His death was also mysterious as claims emerged that he died in a Cuban hospital instead of a military hospital in Venezuela's capital, Caracas. Chavez will lie in state until his funeral on Friday. The vote for a new president should be held within 30 days and will probably pit the socialist vice president Nicolas Maduro against Henrique Capriles, the centrist leader and state governor who lost to Chavez in the October.","Hugo Chavez was a highly outspoken critic of the U.S.

A serial thief who admitted more than 70 burglaries had his sentence halved after he wrote letters to his victims claiming drugs forced him to steal. Callum Greenaway, 26, stole £200,000 worth of goods from homes and businesses in a spate of burglaries described by a judge as ‘immense’. But he escaped the typical five-year sentence for his crimes after writing apologies to those he  burgled, telling them it was ‘nothing personal’. Last night one of his victims said she was unimpressed with the apology, and it did nothing to help ease the upset of losing treasured family jewellery. Greenaway, a career criminal with a 12-year history of offending, faced up to his latest crimewave after he was charged with stealing jewellery during three break-ins at homes in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex. He admitted a further four commercial burglaries, 47 house burglaries and 12 attempted house burglaries in Essex, as well as seven burglaries in Suffolk. The court heard how Greenaway’s previous offences included being drunk and disorderly, dishonesty, possession of drugs, and assaulting a police officer. He previously served three years in a young offenders institution for robbery and in 2008 received a suspended sentence for burglary and handling stolen goods. But during sentencing, Maria Dineen said her client was clean from drugs and should be given credit for showing remorse. In one of the letters to victims read out in court, Greenaway wrote: ‘I burgled your house because I was abusing drugs. I had no concept of remorse. ‘I only cared about one thing at the time and that’s me and getting money for drugs. I hope this letter gives you closure. I hope you realise there was nothing personal about the offence; I did not target you or your family.’ Greenaway had originally been charged with three burglaries in nearby Leigh-on-Sea, before admitting to a host of other crimes . Judge John Lodge, at Southend Crown . Court, said Greenaway had ‘embarked on a catalogue of house burglaries . of an immense nature’. Judge Lodge said the scale of Greenaway's crimes was 'immense' He said the starting point for sentencing would . normally be five years’ custody, but because Greenaway pleaded guilty . and tried to ‘wipe the slate clean’ he would cut this to two-and-a-half . years. One of Greenaway’s victims last night said she did not believe he had turned over a new leaf. The woman, who did not wish to be . named, added that Greenaway had done nothing to help trace jewellery . belonging to her mother and grandfather that he took from her . four-bedroom detached home in Leigh-on-Sea. She said: ‘I don’t think that (the . letter) will help because I don’t have much faith it’s going to make a . difference. I feel quite cynical.’ Last November, Greenaway stole . jewellery belonging to her mother, who died months earlier, and a . signet ring that belonged to her grandfather, who was killed in the . First World War. She said: ‘At the time, I thought I’d . really like to talk to him and see if he realises the upset he’s . caused. These people look at a home like mine and think “big house means . lots of money”, but that’s not always the case.’","Callum Greenaway, 26, burgled Leigh-on-Sea and Suffolk homes .

A British grandmother has become the first person in the world to be fitted with a life-saving 'miniature sieve' to prevent blood clots. Doreen Carter, 80, was fitted with the revolutionary device by doctors at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading during a 15-minute procedure. The surgery involves inserting a specially-designed titanium filter via a catheter into a major vein that carries blood to the heart. Mrs Carter said it was 'a privilege' to be the first patient to undergo the procedure . Once inserted into the inferior vena cava - the wire mesh or cage is inflated and acts to catch any clots before they travel to the lungs. Doctors believe the procedure could prevent thousands dying from blood clots after surgery. Mrs Carter, from Wokingham, had the device put in on Thursday following a major bowel operation. She said it was 'a privilege' to be the first patient to undergo the procedure. 'I’m quite happy everyone knows what they’re doing and I just let them get on with it,' she added. Dr . Carl Waldmann, a consultant at the hospital, said patients can be at . higher risk of blood clots following surgery but using anti-clotting . drugs could be risky. However, other measures to catch clots also carry risks because they are difficult to insert and remove. He said the new device 'is something we can put in for a limited number of days and easily take out.' Intensive care unit nurse Abby Brown, 35, pictured with the device - a titanium wire inside an 18-inch-long tube . Pulmonary embolisms - blood clots which reach the lungs - kill an estimated 25,000 people a year in the UK. A spokesperson for Royal Berkshire Hospital said: 'We are one of seven hospitals who are taking part in the project - six in the UK and one in Belgium. 'We didn’t expect to be the first in the world - our ICU team had only received their training a few hours prior to Doreen arriving in the unit following her surgery. 'They realised that she could benefit from being fitted with the device so, after discussions with her, it was decided to go ahead.' One of the nurses involved in the procedure, Ellen Bowley, said: 'I’m really proud to have been part of the team and hopefully this will be of real benefit to a great many patients in the future.' Surgeons at The Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading had received their training in fitting the device a few hours before Mrs Carter was put forward for the procedure . Dr Carl Waldmann added: 'With the existing devices patients had to be taken down for a specialist procedure with could take up to three hours in total. 'Obviously, moving patients from intensive care is something we try to avoid. 'This new procedure can be carried out within an hour of the patient arriving in intensive care and takes only 15 minutes.' Doreen had the device removed yesterday afternoon - five days after it was installed as she no longer needs it.","Doreen Carter had the device fitted in a major vein near her heart .

Middle-aged optimists were found to have better levels of 'good' cholesterol, which has a protective effect on the heart and helps cancel out 'bad' cholesterol. They also had  lower levels of triglycerides, the fatty molecules involved in hardening of the arteries, said the researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health. Be Happy: Middle-aged people who are optimistic were found to have better levels of 'good' cholesterol, which has a protective effect on the heart . Part of the reason may be due to the optimists' tendency to have a healthy body weight and a 'prudent' diet, say the researchers. They analysed data from the Midlife in the . United States study, which included phone interviews and lab tests for . 990 people aged 40 to 70. Based on the interviews, participants' levels of optimism were rated on a scale from 6 to 30 depending on their . agreement or disagreement with statements such as 'in uncertain times I . usually expect the best', and so on. People with higher optimism scores also . had more high-density lipoprotein (HDL) - the desirable form of . cholesterol that is believed to protect against heart disease. For every increase of five points on the optimism scale, HDL in the blood increased by one milligram per deciliter. That same HDL increase would translated to a three per cent reduction in the risk for heart disease, the researchers said. For comparison, regular exercise can decrease heart disease risk by six per cent. Optimists also have higher levels of triglycerides, the fatty molecules involved in hardening of the arteries . But there was no connection between . optimism and total cholesterol levels, or to low-density lipoproteins . (LDL), the bad' cholesterol. Lead study author Julia Boeh said: 'It is one additional piece of evidence suggesting that our psychological health and physical health are intertwined, and that viewing the world optimistically may have some tangible benefits for our health.' Previous research by Boehm and her colleagues had shown a link between optimism and lowered heart attack risk, so they decided to look at whether there was an independent connection between optimistic or pessimistic outlooks and cholesterol, which is known to play a role in heart attack risk. Franz Messerli, a cardiologist at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York, who was not involved in the study, said: 'It's still impossible to say whether . optimism causes a change in cholesterol, or cholesterol influences . outlook, or both are subject to some third variable.' The Harvard researchers did try to account for other influences, and when they factored in lifestyles, including diet and alcohol consumption, and body weight - the link between optimism and blood fats became weaker. That suggests that optimists' tendency to have healthier lifestyles and weight may explain 'in part' the differences in their blood lipids, researchers said. Conversely, the risk of heart attack and stroke goes up in depressed people, Messerli said. 'But nobody has shown the opposite, that all of a sudden if you go from a pessimist to an optimist your risk goes down.'","Middle-aged people who are optimistic were found to have better levels of 'good' cholesterol .

Barred: Former Home Secretary David Blunkett was prevented from taking his seat at the Paralympic opening ceremony because he was with his guide dog Cosby . It is the world’s biggest showcase of equality for the disabled. But that didn’t help David Blunkett when he arrived at the Paralympics opening ceremony with his guide dog. The former Home Secretary, who has been blind since birth, was unable to take his seat because he had his dog in tow. Mr Blunkett was shocked and angry after a ‘stroppy and insensitive’ Games official refused to let him sit in his allocated spot. After a frank exchange, a makeshift seat was eventually arranged for the Labour MP on an ‘exposed, blustery gantry’ for the three-and-a-half hour show. Mr Blunkett, 65, one of the country’s most high-profile guide dog users, decided not to ‘have a hissy fit’, insisting he did not want to detract from the spirit of the Paralympics and its ‘demonstration of equality of opportunity’. But he has now spoken out to ensure that others with guide dogs do not endure the same humiliation. He told the Daily Mail: ‘This isn’t just about me. This is about getting it right. ‘I want Games organisers to learn a lesson for the future so that people with guide dogs can be treated as equals.’ Mr Blunkett said he had to ‘bite his lip’ after he was told that his seat was unsuitable for assistance dog Cosby, a black curly-coated retriever cross. He said that up until that point, Games officials and volunteers had treated him with the utmost respect – but things changed when he tried to take his seat. He added: ‘What happened highlights how far we still have to go in changing attitudes towards the challenges faced by people with disabilities.’ The married father-of-three, a lifelong campaigner for guide dog users, said that he has since had ‘very strong words’ with Seb Coe, the chairman of the organising committee for London 2012. Mr Blunkett said that on the night in question, he had been invited as a guest of Channel 4, and Games organisers Locog knew he was coming. Shocked: Politician David Blunkett, pictured with his two guide dogs Cosby and Sadie, campaigns for equal rights for guide dog users . Flaw: Much of the seating in the Olympic stadium is not guide dog friendly . He went on: ‘They should presume that because I can’t see, I will bring a guide dog as it gives me independence when getting about the park and stadium. ‘As I walked to my seat, an official said “Sorry, you can’t take your dog down there.” So I asked why not, and he said, “It’s just not suitable.” I said that was his judgment not mine, and asked why we didn’t make a decision together instead? ‘That was the point when the official  got quite stroppy. He said to me, “You are not taking your dog down there. We will find you different seats.” I had to draw a breath and decide whether or not to have a hissy fit. ‘I would have done on a different occasion, but I bit my tongue. As  a high-profile guide dog user, I  very rarely have a problem. ‘It was quite novel actually, as . usually I am taking up the cause for other people who have suffered . prejudice or discrimination by having their dogs refused entry to taxis . and restaurants. I haven’t had a problem for many, many years, which is . why I find it quite shocking.’ He . added that Wednesday’s experience was ‘an indication of just how . insensitive some individuals can be’ and believes that instead of a flat . refusal, the official should have discussed the situation with him. He . added: ‘After a while, they magicked up some chairs and said we could . sit on those. But it was behind the TV cameras and was very exposed and . windy. It wasn’t what we had envisaged at all. ‘Before we walked into the stadium, we had been treated very well. I cannot fault it. It is such a pity that it happened.’ Ironic: Mr Blunkett says he was forced to sit in a 'blustery gantry' because his seat was unsuitable for a guide dog . Fellow guests: David Cameron, Samantha Cameron, Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Princess Anne were also present at the opening ceremony . High profile: The Paralympic opening ceremony, watched by 11.2million people, is meant to act as a showcase of equality for the disabled .

True grit: China's Lu Dong, who has no arms, grips a towel between her teeth so she can launch herself into the pool at the Aquatics Centre . Richard Leaman, chief executive of Guide Dogs, said he was ‘extremely disappointed’ to hear about Mr Blunkett’s treatment. He added: ‘We have worked hard to help Locog to ensure that both the Olympics and Paralympics  are fully accessible to blind and  partially-sighted people. ‘This has included detailed briefings and guidance on accessibility requirements for blind people as well as providing our sighted guide training to around 1,500 Games mobility volunteers.’ Last night Locog would not comment in detail on the incident and did not clarify its policy on guide dogs in Paralympic venues. A spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the issue and we are looking into the circumstances.’","Former Home Secretary David Blunkett was invited to the Paralympic opening ceremony as a guest of Channel 4 .

President Obama has reached out to several high-profile members of the Republican party and will meet for dinner with GOP senators Wednesday night after facing weeks of partisan gridlock. The gesture acts as a political olive branch, signalling the president’s willingness for bipartisanship. Tonight’s dinner – if it is not canceled by the impending snow storm – will include Sens. John McCain, Kelly Ayotte, Pat Toomey, and Lindsey Graham, who put together the guest list. Dinner party: President Obama, pictured yesterday, will host several high-ranking Republicans Wednesday night at a hotel near the White House . Guest list: Sen. John McCain, of Arizona left, and en. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina are two powerful GOP leaders coming to dinner Wednesday night . The dinner will be held at The Jefferson Hotel near the White House and will be followed up by Obama making a rare trip to Capitol Hill. Obama's Republican outreach follows Washington's failure to reach a deal to avert the so-called sequester, the $85 billion in automatic budget cuts that started going into effect last Friday. Noticeably, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner were left out of tonight’s dinner, and did not make the list of Republican lawmakers the president called over the weekend, according to the Associated Press. Sources told the New York Times that Obama’s invitation was extended to around a dozen rank-and-file GOP lawmakers, most of them senators. The sources revealed that the president hopes to reach agreements over several large issues like gun control and climate change which have so far defined his second term. In trying to charm the GOP rather than pressuring lawmakers, the administration is demonstrating a shift in strategy based more on bipartisanship. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that the president requested a meeting next week through his chief of staff. McConnell's office said the president last attended the Senate GOP's policy lunch in May 2010. Out in the cold: Neither House Speaker John Boehner, left, nor Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, right, were invited to tonight's dinner . Wet house: Tourists look at the front of the White House before severe weather and snow hit the Washington region today as federal workers were given a snow day . 'We have numerous challenges facing the country and Republicans have offered the president serious solutions to shrink Washington spending and grow the economy,' McConnell said. 'And we will have an opportunity to discuss them with the president at the lunch.' House Speaker Boehner's office said Wednesday that the president had also requested the meeting next week with House Republicans. The White House and Boehner's office were working to schedule that meeting, the speaker's office said. Among those who received calls from the president were Oklahoma Sen.Tom Coburn and South Carolina's Graham. Snowquester: The dinner could be cancelled as a winter storm passes through Washington; Capitol Hill can be seen looking from from Pennsylvania Avenue today . 'This is how you solve hard problems,' Graham told the Associated Press. 'We're talking about following up on that, how we can get more people in the mix, so what I see from the president is incredibly encouraging.' White House aides say the president's calls with Republicans focus in part on jumpstarting broader budget talks, but also on Obama's proposals for overhauling the nation's immigration laws and enacting stricter gun control measures. 'He is reaching out and talking to members about a variety of issues - not just our fiscal challenges, but certainly the fiscal issues are among the issues he is talking about with lawmakers,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said.","Obama to hold dinner hosting mostly GOP senators tonight at hotel near the White House .

A mother has revealed how she fears James Bulger murderer Jon Venables may be her son's father. She suspects that she briefly dated the child killer while unaware of his true identity. But after seeing recent pictures that claim to be Venables, she was horrified when she recognised the resemblance between him and her former lover. She believes she briefly dated Venables - who was given a different identity on release - in 2008 after he had been released from custody for the murder of toddler James. The relationship abruptly ended before she gave birth after she discovered he was a Schedule One offender – a person who has been convicted of the worst crimes against children. She told The Mirror she had no idea of his true identity or the exact nature of his offences. When social services warned her that her then-boyfriend was a risk to children, she broke off their relationship, and has never heard from him since. Social workers have warned her not to put the name of the father on her child's birth certificate. She was appalled when she realised her son's father could be the same person as the man who tortured and killed two-year-old James in Liverpool. 'The pictures were basically the same. Except in the pictures I had he was smaller, weight wise. 'It was a bit of a shock to me. I would never have put two and two together.' The unnamed woman is believed to have met the father of her child on a dating website, when he was 26. CCTV footage caught child murderers Jon Venables and Robert Thompson taking James away.

They were released on licence in 2001 and given new identities. They are protected by an injunction granting them lifelong anonymity for fear of revenge attacks. Venables was jailed again for two years in July 2010 after pleading guilty to downloading and distributing child pornography. In another case, Venables attempted to seduce a mother-of-one over the internet by sending her flattering messages. Sarah Finn, 36, unknowingly exchanged dozens of online messages and texts with James Bulger's killer. They would chat about rock music, festivals and partying. Venables told her he loved the Pirates of the Caribbean films and the rock band, Muse. He sent flattering messages and texts to her and tried to persuade her to meet up with him but Miss Finn, who has a 10-year-old son, never accepted his invitations. Miss Finn eased off on their online relationship after Venables' messages became increasingly sexual, culminating in him sending her a photograph of his penis. Venables has served his child pornography sentence and a parole hearing is scheduled to take place within the next couple of months.

A shooting at a VIP nightclub in an upscale Seattle suburb left one man dead and hundreds of parties - including reality star Aubrey O'Day and most of the Seattle Seahawks team - diving for cover. Police say a 19-year-old smuggled a handgun into the Munchbar club in Bellevue, Washington, and opened fire about 1am on Monday - killing a 30-year-old man and shooting a second man in the hand. The suspect, Ja'mari Jones, is on the run and considered armed and dangerous. Scroll down for video .

Jones was convicted in 2009 of the high-profile, brutal beating death of 'the Tuba Man,' a beloved Seattle street musician. Because he was 16 at the time, he served less than 36 weeks in juvenile detention. Munchbar was packed with more than 600 people when the shooting began. Among the attendees were reality TV star and Playboy model Aubrey O'Day, who tweeted: 'Ok. I have never in my life. Supposedly someone was shooting n the club and we had to duck on the floor. Security pulled us out. Wtf?!' The former Danity Kane girl group singer had tweeted only moments earlier about dancing on tables at a VIP area with Seattle Seahawks players.

Several Seahawks players were reportedly in the club at the time celebrating their 42-13 win over the 49ers. Bellevue, a wealthy town ten miles east of Seattle that has had only one other murder in 2012, is home to many members of the NFL team. Head Coach Pete Carroll said in a news conference on Monday afternoon that no one associated with the Seahawks was involved in the shooting. 'From what we know, our guys were in a separate area, and nobody was involved at all,' he said. 'A very grave incident, but fortunately the guys that we are with are fine. They're OK. It's too bad. An awful thing that happened.' Police have not commented on the motive in the murder. They said the murdered man and Jones were seen arguing at the club before the shooting. The victim's name was not released and police said they aren't sure whether he was the intended target of the bullets. They do not know whether the two knew each other. A second man was shot in the hand and is expected to survive. 'He was not forthcoming with police,' spokeswoman Carla Iafrate told MailOnline. When the gunfire erupted, the club was a scene of chaos Ms Iafrate said. 'People just scattered and ducked and took cover, whatever they could do,' she said.

After nearly eighty years behind the wheel, Jean Marriott is not only still driving but doing it in style after forking out on a brand new set of wheels. The 94-year-old first got behind the wheel aged 15 in 1934 when King George V was on the throne, the first Donald Duck film was made and US bank robbers Bonnie and Clyde were killed. Almost eight decades on, the mother-of-three is still going strong and has just purchased a new Nissan Micra. She may be 94, but Jean Marriott from Norfolk has got no intention of giving up driving and has bought a new car to mark nearly 80 years behind the wheel . In her long and distinguished driving career Mrs Marriott has managed an almost perfect record. She's chalked up just one speeding fine and has never been involved in an accident despite clocking up tens of thousands of miles. Mrs Marriott still vividly remembers the day, during a holiday in Northumberland, when her motor engineer father persuaded her to take the controls of the family's Austin 12 Tourer. 'He was a keen motorist and he just wanted me to get started,' said Mrs Marriott, from Sheringham, Norfolk. 'There was a complete lack of traffic and the roads were beautifully cambered. Jean in her younger days. She began driving in 1934 when King George V was still on the throne . 'I remember feeling very excited and can still remember the registration - WW 999. It always made me think of spending a penny urgently!' Mrs Marriott has fond memories of picnics and outings in the tourer from the family home near Skipton, North Yorks, to the Lake District and Blackpool. 'My younger brother and I always had to sit in the back,' she said. 'It was jolly cold with the top down and We would cower behind the cellophane screen, wrapped in rugs.' She was 17 when she passed her driving test first time in 1936 - the year after it was introduced in the UK. But she remembers it did not go without drama. While trying to reverse up a steep hill, the clutch became very hot and she had to abandon the attempt. Sprightly Jean, who has only ever had a single speeding fine, doesn't rule out still driving when she is 100 . 'It was the car's fault, not mine, so the examiner passed me - plus he was a friend of my father.' Her one brush with the law came when she was in her 80s and was driving to Hertfordshire to visit one of her children. After a long wait in a traffic jam, she was finally able to get going but was booked and fined £60 for driving at 35mph in a 30mph limit. Nowadays she uses her car to visit her daughter, Barbara Veitch, in Wiveton, Norfolk, or to shop and see friends in nearby Cromer and Holt. 'I enjoy driving and I think I'm quite good at it, although I'm more cautious nowadays,' she said. 'I'll continue driving as long as my health will allow me to and I'm looking forward to taking my new car out for a spin.'","Amazing Jean Marriott, of Sheringham, Norfolk, began driving in 1934 .

A painting that has been gathering dust in storage for decades has been identified as a £1m piece by 17th-century master, Sir Anthony van Dyck. The portrait of a woman with spectacular pearl earrings and a red flowers in her hair was thought to have been an undistinguished copy, and lay languishing in a storage room at Bowes Museum in Durham. But after being photographed for a project to put all the UK's oil paintings on one website, it was spotted by an art historian, who realised the significance of the work. Historians say a previously unknown painting that has been stored at Bowes Museum in Durham is by Van Dyck and could be worth up to £1million. After an investigation by BBC Two's Culture Show, it has been identified as a portrait of Olivia Boteler Porter, a lady in waiting to Henrietta Maria, the wife of Charles I. Van Dyck expert Dr Christopher Brown told the programme it was a 'substantial discovery' and worth up to £1m. Dr Brown, director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, said: 'It's quite clear that this is a late English period Van Dyck. I don't think there's any doubt about that. This absolutely is Van Dyck at his best.' The painting was covered in layers of dirt and varnish and was not on display at the Bowes Museum. The portrait had been gathering dust at the Bowes Museum ion County Durham . But it was photographed as part of the Public Catalogue Foundation's mission to document every oil painting in public ownership and added to the BBC's Your Paintings website, where it was spotted by art historian and dealer Dr Bendor Grosvenor. 'Although as part of our national heritage values are irrelevant, for insurance purposes it should now be valued at anything up to £1m,' Dr Grosvenor said. 'Had it appeared at auction as a copy, and in its dirty state, it would probably only have been estimated at about £3,000-5,000.'

Troubled soccer legend Paul Gascoigne returned to Britain yesterday after a month in rehab at a US clinic. The 45-year-old former England player arrived at Heathrow from Phoenix, Arizona, looking tanned but thin. A traveller said: ‘He looked fine and was completely unfazed when people took pictures. He looked very skinny but was calm and seemed well.’ Thin but sober: Paul Gascoigne arriving at his home yesterday looking frail . Gascoigne hid himself under an umbrella as his driver whisked him off to what is thought to be another clinic where he will continue therapy. The player had spent over a month undergoing treatment at the £7,500-a-week Cottonwood Clinic near Tucson, where he reportedly impressed medics. They agreed to his early release and he returned to Bournemouth, where he will be monitored. He was said to have been close to death in America but rallied and friends revealed that he had undergone a huge improvement. ‘He knows he’s been given one last chance,’ said one. ‘He’s unrecognisable from the man who went into the clinic.’ Celebrity friends of the former England legend, 45, clubbed together to help fund his treatment after he suffered a public meltdown at a charity event in Northampton in January. Now Gascoigne has vowed to quit drinking. A source close to the star told the Sun: . ‘We’re just delighted that Paul’s back on track and coming home, where . he can get back into his routine of doing the things he enjoys – without . the booze getting in the way ever again.' The footballer is now said to have pledged to quit drinking once and for all. Emotional: The footballer has admitted drinking binges have almost killed him in the past . Rehab: Gazza is understood to be heading back to Britain after a month in a clinic in Arizona . Following his shambolic appearance in Northampton, a . former friend of the one-time midfielder released video footage of . Gascoigne mumbling, groaning, and struggling to stay conscious. His ex-flatmate Shane Abbott claimed Gascoigne was drinking two litres of gin and 15 cans of Stella Artois a day in the period leading up to his stint in rehab. The 36-year-old also said he was taking up to 30 anti-depressant Valium pills daily and injecting cocaine. After being admitted to the Cottonwood Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, Gascoigne was rushed . to intensive care amid fears alcohol withdrawal could have triggered a major organ failure, the report in the Sun said. Celebrities . such as Chris Evans, Alan Shearer, Alan Sugar and Ronnie Irani have . lent support to a Twitter campaign to raise the £100,000 needed to cover Gascoigne's treatment.

The campaign followed the former footballer's public appearance at An Evening With Paul Gascoigne held at Northampton's Park Inn Hotel in January. Hundreds of audience members watched as he mumbled stories and swore repeatedly in response to questions from his agent Terry Baker, who was interviewing him on stage at the event. Gascoigne began by announcing: ‘I’ve had a f****** hard month. F****** hell.’ He also seemed to sob, and repeatedly raised his hand to his face. While holding the microphone with his right hand it shook so uncontrollably that he had to steady it with his left. At one stage Gascoigne mumbled ‘I’ve been on a whisky diet’.

Rich mothers are more likely to give birth by cesarean section than women from poorer areas, new figures have revealed. Stats show the more wealthy the postcode, the more likely it is women will shun the traditional method of childbirth, giving weight to the theory that some mothers really are 'too posh to push'. The highest cesarean section rates were recorded at University College London and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Trusts, where one in three births involved surgery, above the national average of one in four. Surgeons perform a caesarean section (file picture). Figures have shown women from richer postcodes are much more likely to opt for that form of childbirth than their counterparts in poorer areas . Poorer areas like Doncaster and London had much lower rates. King George Hospital in east London delivered fewer than one in 10 babies by caesarean section and scandal–hit Stafford Hospital one in six. Janet Fyle, midwife adviser at the Royal College of Midwives, told the Daily Telegraph she would like to see the number of operations come down but supported the mother's right to choose. 'I do not think it is only 'too posh to push', she said. 'Some women are fearful of labour and giving birth. Sometimes this is from experience.' The Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in Fulham Road, London. One in three mothers elect to shun natural childbirth there . But it's a different story at Barnsley Hospital where the figure is just one in 20 . The statistics combine elective caesareans, when the mother chooses the procedure in advance, and emergency ones required when there are complications during labour. Critics suggest mothers in more affluent areas request the operations to avoid the experience of natural birth. Delivering a baby by caesarean section costs the NHS about £2,600, more than double the £1,200 cost of a natural birth. Research shows having a caesarean section makes women three times more likely to need a hysterectomy after their next pregnancy, and raises the risk of death, blood clots and breathing problems in infants. Portland Hospital, London  - 35 per centChelsea and Westminster Hospital - 15.8%University College Hospital, London - 15%Northampton General Hospital - 13.9%Kingston Hospital - 13.5% .

At Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, which lies in one of the wealthiest areas of London, one in six surgical births were performed by choice rather than in an emergency. In some private hospitals the rate is even higher. At Portland hospital in Surrey, more than half of births last year were caesarean section and over a third of them elective. The national average for elective surgery is one in 10, and in some hospitals such as Barnsley in South Yorkshire, as low as one in 20. The figures for 2011–12 showed the overall caesarean section rate rose 0.2 per cent despite guidance issued in late 2011 saying mothers should have the freedom to choose how they give birth. The operation was more common in older women, with one in three mothers over the age of 35 having a caesarean section compared with fewer than one in six under the age of 25.","As many as one in three new babies in Chelsea born by caesarean section .

Sally Sinclair was stabbed more than 30 times by her husband Alisdair after she admitted having an affair . Two boys whose mother was brutally killed by their father have had to hand over their inheritance to pay for the cost of cleaning the bloodstains. Sally Sinclair was stabbed 30 times by her controlling husband Alisdair in a horrific 20-minute knife attack. After the tragedy her twin sons stood to inherit her £13,000 assets. But the entire amount has had to be handed to the landlords of the family’s rented mansion to cover blood-spattered furnishings and other damage. Owners Patrick and Maureen Langdown had launched a £92,000 legal action over losses resulting from Mrs Sinclair’s killing in 2008. An itemised damage claim included £4,555 for new carpets, £782 for  dry-cleaning blood-stained curtains and £2,100 for redecorating bloodied walls at £900,000 Kiln House in Amport, Hampshire. Another £15,446.06 was attributed to ‘blight’ – with the Langdowns claiming Mrs Sinclair’s death had caused both the value of the property and its rental income to plunge. Now Mrs Sinclair’s mother Nikki Alford has made the decision to hand over her grandchildren’s inheritance in return for the landlords abandoning legal action. Alisdair Sinclair, who was jailed for nine years for the manslaughter of his wife, has already been released after serving half his sentence. He is believed to have no assets. Landlords Patrick and Maureen Langdown launched a £92,000 legal action for damage to their Hampshire house . Mrs Alford, 64, was appalled by the Langdowns’ legal action after her daughter’s death. She said: ‘The £13,000 value of her estate was all she could leave to her children. ‘She died intestate but they would have had that money. Then we found we had to give it away. ‘We just couldn’t believe it. The Langdowns were perfectly within their legal rights but whether it was ethical .  .  . well, it wasn’t, was it? Alisdair Sinclair was jailed for nine years after he stabbed his wife Sally more than 30 times after she had an affair . ‘How could anyone do that to children. It doesn’t matter whether the law was on their side or what damage had been caused.’ Mrs Alford said lawyers had advised that paying the £13,000 under a ‘deed of assignment’ was the only way to avoid further liability. So she agreed for fear that her grandchildren might be saddled with expensive legal fees in future years. At his trial in 2009, the jury heard how Mr Sinclair, now 52, was a house husband who ruthlessly controlled his 40-year-old wife, a Vodafone executive. Winchester Crown Court was told that he was ‘a man in a jealous rage who did not want to let go’ after his wife admitted having an affair and sought a divorce. At the time of Mrs Sinclair’s death, Mr Langdown told one newspaper: ‘It is tragic. It is horrible. This is a new experience to us in a private quiet hamlet. My feelings are with the family and children.’ Despite the Langdowns’ claim that the killing would affect the future price of Kiln House, evidence  suggests it has actually increased  in value. Papers submitted to Test Valley Borough Council show that the house was worth around £825,000 in February 2009. By April 2011, it was valued at £900,000. When The Mail On Sunday attempted to contact Mr Langdown at his farmhouse in Amport, he declined to explain why he had pursued compensation from Mrs Sinclair’s estate. A woman who said she was his daughter told us: ‘I’m afraid my father has no comment to make.’","Patrick and Maureen Langdown launched a £92,000 legal action .

Survivors from the ship flood one raft in an attempt to stay afloat as they wait to be rescued . The MV Spice Islander was believed to be carrying up to 800 passengers as well as heavy cargo, which may have caused it to sink. The state of Zanzibar has now begun three days of mourning for the victims of the fatal crash with the Tanzanian government calling for an immediate investigation to uncover the reasons for the disaster. 'The ship's manifest shows that the vessel travelling from Unguja to Pemba islands had more than 500 passengers on board,' Zanzibar Police Commissioner Mussa Alli Mussa said. 'Some 260 passengers have so far been rescued ... we have recovered several bodies but I can't give you the exact death toll at the moment because the situation is very volatile,' he said.

The parents of a toddler who was 'sent home to die' have spoken of their outrage after the General Medical Council refused to strike off the doctor who treated him. The health watchdog was today accused of having 'blood on its hands' after it allowed emergency out-of-hours GP Aboo Thamby to continue working. Harry Connolly was 19 months old when he died of dehydration and acute kidney failure after suffering inflammation of the colon in May 2011. Tragic: Harry Connolly died of acute dehydration and kidney failure. His parents say  the last doctor to treat him, out-of-hours GP Aboo Thamby, 'effectively killed' their son . Doctors sent him home three times in three days even though he showed clear signs of dehydration. The last person to treat Harry was Dr Thamby, who told his parents Lucy, 30, and Ray, 45, their 'lifeless and unresponsive' son had a virus. He advised them to go home and feed him rice and yogurt. Two days later, Harry died in his sleep. An inquest last April condemned his treatment and said he died needlessly due to a series of failures and 'catastrophic' errors by medical staff. And last week, a GMC investigation ruled Dr Thamby's conduct did not meet the standards required of a doctor and risked bringing the profession into disrepute. It also found that his standard of . care fell 'below the expected level of a competent GP' and concluded . there had been 'a significant departure from good medical practice'. But despite the findings the GMC decided that Dr, Thamby's actions did not fall seriously below the expected levels or care. They issued him with a formal warning . - but did not suspended his licence or strike him off and allowed him . to carry on practising as a doctor. Missed opportunities: Doctors sent Harry home three times in three days - even though he showed clear signs of dehydration . Angry: His parents Raymond and Lucy said the GMC has 'blood on its hands' after allowing Dr Thamby to continue working . Harry's mother branded the decision 'a disgrace' and accused Dr. Thamby of 'effectively killing' her son. Mrs Connolly, a bank worker, from Delapre, Northamptonshire, said: 'I am beyond furious - the GMC have blood on their hands. 'There were others responsible for Harry's death but effectively he has killed him. 'His actions have lead to his death and the fact he has been allowed to carry on treating patients is disgraceful. 'Since the day Harry died he has been allowed to continue working as a GP. He has never apologised to us.' Mrs Connolly, who also has a . seven-month-old daughter, Edie, said: 'We essentially took him in . lifeless and unresponsive and the his attitude was to send him home to . eat some rice and yoghurt. He didn't seem bothered at all - his attitude . stank. 'We have to . relive this whole nightmare on a daily basis knowing nobody has been . held accountable. He should have been struck off. 'He's been reported to the GMC before and it's taken for somebody to die before any action is taken. Dr Thamby advised Mrs Connolly (pictured with daughter Edie) that Harry had a virus, and advised her to feed him rice and water. He died two days later . The toddler had already been admitted to Northampton General Hospital twice in the previous six days, as he was so unwell . 'But . despite this and a two year investigation which found he had failed to . examine Harry properly - this doctor can carry on treating patients. He . has shown no remorse whatsoever. 'We took this action because we didn't want any other families to go through the heartbreak that we did. 'But now he has been allowed to keep his license - who is to say this couldn't happen again?' The investigation also found an elderly patient had complained about Dr Thamby 18 months before Harry's death. Linda Davis, 67, of Cogenhoe, Northants said he misdiagnosed a blood clot on her lung as an ear infection but no action was taken against him by the GMC.

The ‘blight’ of giant windfarms spreading across Britain is the ‘most widespread and persistent threat’ to our countryside, the National Trust has warned. Chairman Sir Simon Jenkins yesterday singled out the proliferation of wind turbines as he highlighted concerns about the Government’s planning reforms, which he said would cause ‘warfare’ in local communities if not delayed. His comment come just weeks after its new director-general, Dame Helen Ghosh, described wind turbines as ‘beautiful’, but agreed that land near historic buildings or sensitive landscapes was not the right place for the giant windmills. Blight on the landscape: The National Trust claims Wind Farms, such as this one in Ingbirchworth, West Yorkshire, are today the most 'widespread and persistent threat' to the British countryside . Speaking yesterday Sir Simon spoke of how the trust was fighting wind farm applications on an increasingly frequent basis. He said: ‘There’s clearly a major battle taking place almost everywhere on wind farms. Wind turbines are very intrusive forms of renewable energy. ‘National Trust policy is perfectly clear. We’re not against renewable energy or wind turbines in the right place, we do oppose wind turbines that blight the landscape. ‘We’re sceptical over wind in the wrong place. At the moment there are threats of wind turbines the breadth of the country,’ he said. ‘In almost every region of Britain there are proposals on wind farms which local people are fighting brilliantly. The National Trust has to be conversant with this battle.’ National Trust Chairman Sir Simon Jenkins raised the issue as he highlighted concerns over the Government's planning reforms . Asked if the National Trust would consider buying areas of outstanding beauty to prevent them from the giant windmills, Sir Simon said it would not be possible due to the scale of applications. ‘We are always in the market for property. But to be honest, the threat is so widespread, you can’t even think about it. If you started buying land in Dumfries and Galloway to protect it, you would buy the whole of Dumfries and Galloway,’ he said. But the National Trust would consider buying easements – a right over the land - to prevent the building of wind farms in sensitive landscapes. Sir Simon warned that planning reforms intended to stimulate the economy ‘will produce not more housing, but more conflict’. The charity is calling for a delay in the introduction of the rules set to come into force later this month, in order to prevent local communities becoming entrenched in costly battles with building and wind farm developers. It said councils need more time to adopt local plans which specify where building can take place, to prevent the ‘risk of unwanted speculative development’. So far, only half of local authorities have created plans for their area, according to research carried out by the Trust. Campaigners fear those without their own guidelines will be forced to follow national rules that favour indiscriminate construction. Following what was a ‘difficult year’ for the trust, Sir Simon warned of an unprecedented number of threats to Britain’s countryside, including the spread of wind farms, as well as the proposed route of the HS2 high-speed rail line and the prospect of shale gas exploration. Asked about the growing number of planning disputes, he said: ‘I can’t remember anything like it....we can spend our entire time in court. This I because Britain is not being planned. If you do not have plans, you have battles.’ A year ago, councils were given until the end of this month to adopt local plans spelling out where development can take place in their area, or be subject to national guidelines which state a ‘presumption in favour of sustainable development’. But just over half will miss the deadline, making it much easier for developers to build on unprotected parts of the countryside, Sir Simon warned. He said the Trust was ‘not against development - we’re against inappropriate development’, and said local plans would ensure building happened in the right places. The charity is ‘pleading’ with the Government to extend the deadline for another year, otherwise ‘it will just mean everyone will spend their time fighting, fighting, fighting - and that will not be the best way to plan Britain.’ The Government’s current approach to planning would produce less development, Sir Simon said.‘These are difficult times and the Government is desperate to find means of growth, and thinks somehow allowing development to rip will give them growth. We disagree,’ he said. ‘It will produce not more housing, but more conflict. You start trying to build houses where people don’t want them, anyone who knows anything about local Britain knows it will be a warfare area.’","Chairman of the Trust, Sir Simon Jenkins, made the claim as he raised concerns over Government's planning reforms .

His father Sivarugudas  46, from Beddington, south London, took his 16-month-old son to St Helier Hospital in Sutton on January. Sannjay was having problems breathing due to a bad cold. Sannjay Varathabawan stopped breathing for three minutes after a nurse twisted his oxygen tube, his parents claim . He was transferred to St George's Hospital's intensive-care unit in Tooting where a nurse inserted a cannula tube into his stomach to take a blood sample. She left him asleep but after 40 minutes Sannjay's mother, Subothini, 39, noticed his blanket was soaked in blood. The nurse tried to clean Sannjay up but Mr Varathabawan claims that while she was lifting him, his oxygen tube twisted, blocking his air supply and causing his heart to stop. Mr Varathabawan called for other doctors and nurses who managed to resuscitate Sannjay after his heart stopped for around three minutes.

With a one-point lead, 2.9 seconds to play and possession of the ball, all Hugo High School had to do was inbound the basketball and run out the clock to advance in the Oklahoma state boys' basketball tournament. But what followed stunned everyone. Hugo guard Trey Johnson got confused after he received the inbounds pass and laid the ball into the wrong basket just before time expired. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Slam dunk: Millwood High School's Chris Cook watches in astonishment as Hugo's Trey Johnson makes the game-winning basket for Millwood in a Class 3A boys state basketball tournament . It gave the opposing team, Millwood High, a 38-37 win on Thursday night and a place in the Class 3A semifinals. 'When I saw the kid going that way, I was like, ""No, he's not. No, he's not ... Oh, yes he is,""' Millwood assistant coach David Samilton told The Oklahoman. 'I couldn't believe it.' Trey needed only to dribble away the remaining seconds to wrap up a victory for Hugo. Instead, he got turned around and dropped in a most bizarre buzzer-beater, Hugo coach Darnell Shanklin told The Associated Press on Friday. Hugo's celebrating fans went silent, and Millwood fans broke out in celebration after a moment of silence for reassurance that the points - and the win - were theirs. 'Without a doubt, that's the toughest locker room I've ever had to talk to,' Mr Shanklin said. Mistake: The basket seen being made by the 16-year-old junior gave the opposing team a 38-37 win on Thursday night and a place in the Class 3A semifinals . And the 16-year-old high school junior was tough to console, Mr Shanklin said, adding that other players on the team called and texted him on Friday offering their support. 'The kid feels terrible. It's still a game, regardless of what anyone says, basketball is still a game,' Mr Shanklin said. With the win, Millwood advances to a semifinal matchup against two-time defending state champ, Centennial High. 'I feel sorry for him,' Mr Samilton said of Trey. 'I really do feel sorry for him. But hey, I'll take it.' Mr Samilton wasn't alone in sharing Johnson's pain. On Friday NBA general manager for the Oklahoma Thunder, Sam Presti, personally contacted the 16-year-old and invited him to Sunday's NBA game against the Boston Celtics, the Oklahoman reports. Trey will attend as a guest of the team.

"By . Paul Goodman . PUBLISHED: . 19:23 EST, 9 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:29 EST, 10 March 2013 . Could Theresa May lead the Conservative party? And what kind of leader would she be? Last weekend, this newspaper broke the story that Theresa May wants Britain to leave the European Court of Human Rights. Yesterday, she confirmed that this is indeed her view. ‘Are we restricting our ability to act in the national interest? Are we conceding that our own Supreme Court is not supreme? I believe we are,’ she said. ‘I want to be clear that all options – including leaving the Convention altogether – should be on the table.’ And a Conservative Government will, she confirmed, scrap the Human Rights Act. To pull Britain out of the ECHR would be to return justice in this country to where it belongs – into the hands of our own courts, and out of those of a distant and discredited institution which declares that prisoners should have the right to vote. But Mrs May did not take this bold stance in isolation. It formed part of the first-ever speech in which she set out her political world view – ranging outside her Home Office brief to set out a deeply personal political manifesto. It was a declaration of intent, confirming that she intends to be a candidate for the Conservative leadership if David Cameron loses the next General Election. So could Mrs May really lead the Tory Party? And, if so, what kind of leader would she be? I worked alongside her as a Conservative MP in a neighbouring constituency  (I was the MP for Wycombe, she for Maidenhead) for the best part of ten years. She was an exemplary neighbour – helpful and supportive. All in all, she had all the qualities of what Tory MPs call ‘a good colleague’, save one – clubability, that mix of approachability and gregariousness that helps MPs to rub along together.  Mrs May was a cat who walks by itself. In the lobbies where MPs vote, they tend to mix in groups, exchanging news, jokes, information and gossip. But while other MPs would look for friends, Mrs May would stalk through alone, halting only for an occasional pleasantry or to buttonhole a colleague about political business, but never part of a group or gang. And with that sense of solitude came a fierce sense of territoriality. Woe betide any unhappy MP or fellow frontbencher who trespassed into her territory or, worse, made a grab for part of it. I saw this at first-hand when she clashed with Sayeeda Warsi over setting up a new integration ministry. At the time, Mrs May was in charge of the party’s approach to ethnic minorities, as well as women, and Lady Warsi’s plan would have torn off a slice of her empire. Mrs May clashed with Baroness Wrsi over plans to set up a new integration ministry . Since I worked in the same team as Lady Warsi, I went to the meeting at which the idea was set out. Mrs May received us pleasantly and graciously and Lady Warsi began to make her pitch. As soon as she did, the smile on our host’s face turned wintry. Lady Warsi had scarcely finished before Mrs May launched a blood-drawing counter-attack, utilising  every bureaucratic device  in the book to kill the scheme at birth. Mrs May is a formidable operator, but not always one who commands the affection of those who work with her. Some senior Ministers allow their juniors the freedom to flourish. Others try to control everything themselves. Almost all of Mrs May’s colleagues place her in the latter camp. When she returns home late at night after a division in the Commons or desk work at the Home Office, there will be few distractions from the toil of churning through the paperwork in those Ministerial red boxes. This picture helps to capture the sense of isolation that somehow surrounds her. But that concentration has served her well. In a department notorious for imperilling the careers of those who serve there, she has prospered. She is unwaveringly focused on reducing crime, reforming the police and, above all, reducing net immigration – the figures for which are moving in the right direction. And that iciness is melting a bit. The Commons has changed since the last election. The Conservatives now have some 50 women MPs, and Mrs May seems more at ease with the new generation of Tories whose votes will be crucial in any future leadership election. Comparisons are being made betwen Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel . She has an energetic team in the Home Office behind her, and the services of a sociable aide – George Hollingbery, the MP for Meon Valley and her Parliamentary Private Secretary – to draw on. Senior MPs, such as the former Cabinet Minister Cheryl Gillan, speak admiringly of her work in government. And the Home Secretary is now offering informal ‘surgeries’ at the back of the Commons tearoom each week. A year ago, her lack of clubability seemed to leave her an unlikely future Tory leader. But since then, she has put herself at the head of the ‘National Union of Ministers’ – the team of Cabinet members, including Philip Hammond and Chris Grayling – who have had enough of cuts to their departments. One Minister spoke appreciatively to me recently of how well she performs in Cabinet, and how, when necessary, she is prepared to stand up to George Osborne, the most powerful man in the Government. Her team have been busy marketing her as ‘the British Merkel’, a future equivalent of the dour but effective German Chancellor. The only element lacking to date in her quiet leadership campaign has been a wider view of politics to accompany the grasp of detail. And now we have it. ‘We have to become the party that is tireless in confronting vested interests,’ she said yesterday. ‘The party that takes power from the elite and gives it to the people.’ It was an appeal perfectly pitched for the marginal seats that her party must win in 2015. It confirmed that she is ready to lead if Cameron falls – not just after the Election but before it, if his disillusioned party overthrows him.","Has all the qualities of what Tory MPs call 'a good colleague'

An Australian actress has been refused permission to live in the UK with her British husband after immigration officials ruled that he was too poor to support her. Ebony Buckle, who appeared in BBC1’s Inspector George Gently last year, says the enforced separation is taking a toll on her health. Her visa was rejected because her rock singer spouse Nick Burns earned just £7,221 last year – well below the £18,600 threshold required by new immigration laws. Australian Ebony Buckle has been denied a UK visa because her British husband is too poor to support her . She earned more than that, but Border Agency officials considered only her husband’s earnings. Last night, Labour MP Steve McCabe criticised the ‘discriminatory’ rules, saying they ‘put a price on love’, and he pointed out that  EU citizens can now bring non-EU spouses to the UK more easily than British nationals can. Ebony’s lawyer has already appealed the decision, citing controversial human rights legislation that protects the right to family life. The 26-year-old actress said: ‘It was devastating when I received the rejection. We only got married a few months ago and all we want to do is share our lives together. I felt like the acting was just taking off, but now it’s all had to be put on hold.’ Nick, 27, added: ‘The decision has taken its toll on my personal and mental health. A lot of it’s down to not being able to sleep. It’s extremely frustrating but, more than that, I’ve lost faith in the way I live my life as a UK citizen. I feel at my wits’ end.’ Their treatment by the UK Border Agency contrasts with that of other EU citizens living here, who can apply for an European Economic Area family permit for non-EU spouses to join them – which has no minimum income requirement. British citizens living elsewhere in the EU can also apply for the EEA family permit, then use that visa to settle back in the UK. UK immigration officials deemed rock singer Nick Burns too poor to support his Australian wife Ebony Buckle . But because Nick already lives in Britain, his wife must apply for a settlement visa, which has the financial requirement. Mr McCabe, who sits on the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘This is a discriminatory policy because it means a British national cannot bring a wife or husband to Britain from outside the EU unless they have certain level of wealth. ‘It is also strange that the Government should introduce stricter rules for British citizens than those in force for non-British citizens.’ Ebony’s lawyer Muhammed Abdul Muid Khan said: ‘Nick and Ebony will fight this unfair decision on the principle of fairness. Their private and family life is being destroyed by the harsh application of the new immigration rules.’ The couple wed last September in Hampshire’s New Forest, as Ebony was establishing herself as an actress and singer. But two months later she was forced to return to Australia after her Youth Mobility visa expired. She applied for a UK settlement visa, but this was rejected based on her husband’s earnings. She had been offered a £26,500-a-year job as an estate agent in London, but the Border Agency did not allow that to be taken into account when considering the income threshold, introduced last July. Ebony even has some high-level backing for her case. Senior civil servant Sir Alex Allan, former chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee and a long-standing family friend, said: ‘Ebony is an asset to the UK, fully able to support herself and happily married to a British national. It is tragic that unthinking application of the new rules is keeping them apart.’ The Home Office said: ‘Under the free movement directive, European nationals are able to bring family members to the UK. However, they do not have unrestricted access to the UK – they must be working, studying or be self-sufficient.’","Nick Burns's £7,000 earnings deemed insufficient to support Ebony Buckle .

Landmark ruling: George St Angeli is pictured leaving Leeds Magistrates' Court on Wednesday after being removed from the Sex Offenders' Register . Nearly 50 violent attackers are in line to be removed from the sex offenders’ register, the Mail can reveal today. Yesterday it emerged that a convicted paedophile had become the first to have his name taken off the list by exploiting a human rights ruling. George St Angeli was jailed in the mid-1990s for interfering with two young girls and put on the register for life. But the decision means his name is removed permanently and he no longer has to tell police if he is living near a school, travelling overseas or has access to young children. Police had rejected the application, saying they did not consider the 71-year-old to be safe and wanted him to remain under supervision. But despite hearing details of St Angeli’s crimes, a judge last week said he couldn’t see ‘any benefit’ in St Angeli remaining on the register. A Freedom of Information Act request by the Mail shows another 47 sex offenders have made similar requests to police forces. They are entitled to do so under a human rights ruling in 2011 which said it was wrong to keep offenders on the register without any prospect of appeal. The ruling sparked fury among children’s groups. The NSPCC said it feared the rights of convicted sex offenders were being put ahead of the need to protect children. A spokesman told the Sun newspaper: ‘Adults who seriously sexually abuse children should stay on the register for life as you can never be sure they will not commit further offences. We can only try to control and contain their behaviour. ‘We will be monitoring the appeals process closely and will raise concerns if we believe the civil liberties of convicted sex offenders are being put ahead of the protection of children.’ Claude Knights, director of the charity Kidscape, said: ‘This must not open the floodgates. The register does an important job and appeals to be removed should only be successful after very careful consideration. The safety of children is paramount.’ Hearing: At Leeds Magistrates' Court (file picture) on Wednesday, St Angeli became the first person in England to win the right to have his name removed from the register . Tory MP Philip Davies said the ruling was ‘ludicrous’. He added: ‘The only thing a decision like this can do is put more people at risk. This sets a precedent for other cases. It opens the floodgates. I do not see any case where people should be removed from this register.’ Astonished: Conservative MP for Shipley Philip Davies said the ruling was 'absolutely ludicrous' St Angeli committed a string of sex offences against the young girls over a five-year period. He was jailed for five years in 1993 but released on parole in 1996. Last year West Yorkshire Police rejected his application to have his name removed, but the married felon won his appeal at Leeds Magistrates’ Court last week when District Judge Christopher Darnton overturned the ruling. Andrew Garthwaite, representing the police, said: ‘He exploited connections to commit very serious crimes against a girl who ultimately had her life destroyed.’ But Judge Darnton said: ‘The order has now served its purpose and I cannot see any benefit in it remaining.’ St Angeli said the ruling would ‘give me the freedom to travel if I need to, to go on holiday with my wife’. He added: ‘It’s a great weight off my shoulders.’ The register was drawn up to help officers track sex offenders after they are released from prison. Anyone jailed for two years must stay on the register for life. But following the 2011 Supreme Court ruling, adult offenders can appeal for removal 15 years after they leave prison. Young offenders can appeal after eight years. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Offenders who continue to pose a risk should remain subject to notification for life.’","George St Angeli, 71, was jailed for five years in 1993 for child sex offences .

The New York realtor who jumped into a tiger's den at the Bronx Zoo to 'be one' with the animals will face trespassing charges in court this week as his mother claims that the cat who mauled him may have saved his life. David Villalobos, 25, now walks with a limp after being attacked by Bachuta, a 400-pound, 11-year-old Siberian tiger. 'I'm OK,' he told reporters outside his Putnam County home. Scroll down for videos . Healing: David Villalobos walks with a limp after being mauled last September by a 400-pound tiger . Villalobos had posted about tigers on his Facebook page, pictured . On September 21, Villalobos had his . back bitten, where a fang punctured his lung, and his body clawed, after . throwing himself from a moving monorail over a protective fence into . the tiger's enclosure. Now his mother says that it may have . been a blessing in disguise, claiming that Bachuta actually exposed her . son's bad reaction to medications. 'He was always interested in animals,and we brought . him up as a Christian, but Adderall changed his way of thinking,' mother, Fernanda, told the Web site Lawyers and Settlements in November. 'I'm almost getting my son back,' she told the Post. Villalobos is hoping to write a book on his wildlife experience. 'This is a good thing that happened,' he was overheard telling friends working out in a gym. 'Maybe I can make some money, write a book.' Drugged: Villalobo's mother now blames his reaction to prescription medication Adderall for his behavior . The Post also said he was bragging, . saying that the media won’t stop calling him, according to a source, . adding, 'He said he gets calls from people all over the world.' According to the report, Villalobos also said . he was worried about losing his real-estate license because of the . stunt. Villalobos, 25, of . Mahopac, New York was arraigned Friday in a Bronx courthouse and pleaded . not guilty to trespassing charges. He returns to court March 12. In a court complaint, . police Sgt. Peter Monopoli says that when Villalobos was asked why he . jumped, he said, 'Everyone makes choices and we have our reasons in life . why we do things.' He told another investigator, 'I was testing my natural fear, you would not understand,' the complaint says. 'It is a spiritual thing, I wanted to be at one with the tiger.' The trespasser also claimed that . despite his serious injuries, he was able to pet the tiger before . zookeepers came to his rescue, said New York Police Department spokesman . Paul Browne. Police had said earlier that . 25-year-old Villalobos admitted to a police officer making a conscious . decision to jump from an elevated train into the animal's den, but that . his motives were unclear and an arrest uncertain. Staff at the Bronx Zoo, pictured, rushed to help the man after he jumped into an exhibit and was mauled by a tiger . That later changed when, during an . interview at the hospital, Villalobos told detectives that 'his . leap was definitely not a suicide attempt, but a desire to be one with . the tiger,' Browne said. The mauling happened . in the Wild Asia exhibit featuring a train with open sides that takes . visitors over the Bronx River and through a forest, where they glide . along the top edge of a fence past elephants, deer and a tiger . enclosure. Passengers aren't strapped in on the . ride, and Villalobos apparently jumped out of his train car with a leap . powerful enough to clear the 16-foot-high perimeter fence. Katharina, an Amur tiger pictured with her cubs, is one of 10 tigers at the Bronx zoo . Villalobos was alone with a male . Siberian tiger named Bashuta for about 10 minutes before he was rescued . by zoo officials, who used a fire extinguisher to chase the animal away, . said zoo director Jim Breheny. 'When someone is determined to do something harmful to themselves,' Breheny said, 'It's very hard to stop that.' Bashuta was returned to a holding area where it usually sleeps at night and was not be euthanized, zoo officials said. 'The tiger did nothing wrong,' Breheny said. Vicious attack: Rescuers scared the tiger off using fire extinguishers then instructed the injured man to roll under a hot wire to safety . 'The tiger was minding his own business,' New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told ABC News, 'up until the man cleared two sets of fences to get into the enclosure.' But his family, who had no idea he had gone to the zoo, were perplexed as to what went wrong. 'He’s amazing and he loves everybody,' the victim's sister told The New York Daily News. 'I really don’t know what happened.' Officials believe Villalobos was . visiting the zoo by himself. He had recently posted photos of tigers on . his Facebook page, including one of a mother licking her . cub. Tiger's den: The 25-year-old was allegedly riding the zoo's monorail when he jumped out of his seat as the train passed over the tiger's den . The Bronx Zoo, one of . the nation's largest zoos, sprawls over 265 acres and contains hundreds . of animals, many in habitats meant to resemble natural settings. Its exhibits include Tiger Mountain, Congo Gorilla Forest and World of Reptiles. There are 10 tigers at the Wild Asia exhibit, but Bashuta was the only one on display at the time of the attack. Bashuta has been at the zoo for three years. Extraordinary occurrence: Bronx Zoo Director Jim Breheny, pictured, said the tiger was not at fault . There are no surveillance cameras in that area of the exhibit. Zoo officials said they would review safety procedures but believe this was a highly unusual occurrence. 'We review everything, but we honestly think we provide a safe experience,' Breheny said. 'And this is just an extraordinary occurrence... somebody was deliberately trying to endanger themselves.' He added: 'I think it's safe to say that if the tiger really wanted to do harm to this individual, he certainly would have had the time to do that.' Breheny applauded his staff for acting quickly in the extraordinary situation, adding that the man was lucky to escape Bashuta with his life. 'We were able to prevent a bad situation from turning into a real tragedy,' Breheny said. 'We did not have to use deadly force but we were prepared to do so. We’ve never had a single incident like this. You have to be determined to jump out,' he added. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest of the big cats and can weigh up to 674 pounds. Although rare, deadly animal attacks in zoos across the country have happened before. On Christmas Day 2007, a man was killed at the San Francisco Zoo, when a 300-pound tiger named Tatiana escaped her cage and savaged him.","Mother Fernanda blames her son's behavior on bad reaction to Adderall .

A nine-year-old boy who tumbled 160 feet 'like a rag doll' down one of the UK's highest mountains survived with only a bumped head and a bruise on his leg. Marwaan Rajakazee had been climbing Helvellyn mountain in the Lake District with his father Imtiaz who could do nothing to stop his son plummeting after he slipped on an ice-covered slope. As Mr Rajakazee rushed down towards his son's lifeless body he was convinced he had died but, upon reaching the scene, Marwaan sat up and said 'I'm alive.' Tumble: Marwaan Rajakazee, nine, from Preston, Lancashire, was climbing Helvellyn in the Lake District with his father Imtiaz when he slipped on an ice-covered slope . He described his son as a 'cat with nine lives', having previously survived an accident in which a quad bike toppled on him. The 12 medical staff who quickly arrived at the scene in an RA F Sea King helicopter were equally surprised that the child escaped without any serious injuries despite crashing into boulders as he fell. Marwaan, who lives his father, 41, and mother Mubina, 39, in Preston, Lancashire, joked that he will only go walking with his father again only when he is 36. Marwaan said: 'I slipped and then there was rocks at the bottom and I crashed into them. 'I’ve only got bruises. They put me on a stretcher and they tied me to something and lifted me up into the helicopter. 'I couldn’t see anything because they put a thing on my neck that kept me in one position.' Recalling the incident that happened two weeks ago, Mr Rajakazee said: 'He was like a rag doll tumbling down. I thought I had lost him. I can’t even describe the feeling.' The pair had decided to go for a walk as Mr Rajakazee does not like his children 'sitting around watching television all the time'. No injuries: As Mr Rajakazee rushed down towards his son's lifeless body he was convinced he had died but, upon reaching the scene, Marwaan sat up and said 'I'm alive.' He came out of hospital with only minor bruising . During the descent the father and son decided they would slide down, but when Marwaan put his bottom on the ground he 'took off'. Mr Rajakazee said 'you would not expect someone to survive' such a fall, so was amazed when his son was found alive and well. He said: 'The next thing I knew there was 12 paramedics and an RAF helicopter by us. It was so surreal.' After being flown to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle with suspected pelvic and head . injuries, Marwaan was released the following day with minor . bruising. They did the same walk last year, in which Mr Rajakazee said the last 500 feet was also covered in snow and ice. He described the incident as an 'unfortunate accident' and added: 'When you live dangerously these things happen.'","Marwaan Rajakazee was climbing Helvellyn mountain in the Lake District .

When Bob Priddle took early retirement from his job in publishing, he and wife Sara planned to buy a guesthouse in Cornwall to provide them with some income. Instead they ended up purchasing a 16th Century cottage, mill and a museum crammed with 5,000 artefacts – from Bronze Age farm implements to an early Morphy Richards iron. ‘When we saw that it was for sale we weren’t that interested but we thought that a trip to see it would make a nice day out,’ recalls Bob, 62. ‘After walking around the house and museum, we looked at each other and said, “Wow”. We told the owner we’d buy it.’ Flour power: Bob and Sara Priddle are selling The Wayside Museum and the Trewey Mill in Zennor in West Cornwall as a working, live-in, museum . The couple paid £375,000 for Wayside Museum, Fewey Mill and Bridge House in 2002 and although they then had little knowledge of ancient history, the flour business or the tourist trade, they soon became accomplished curators who can describe in detail every artefact from a 5,000-year-old grinding stone to a Fifties washing machine. Bob has even restored the mill to produce organic flour. The business is in the pretty coastal village of Zennor, near St Ives. Currently, it brings in about £60,000 a year but the couple, who are now retiring and selling up, believe it could produce far more. They point out that the museum, for which they charge a £3.75 entrance fee, could be kept open for more months of the year, the mill could be run harder and their four-bedroom cottage could be converted into a holiday let. ‘It’s a lovely business,’ says Bob. ‘We’ve deliberately kept sales below the VAT threshold of £73,000 but there’s huge potential.’ The museum, which has sections dedicated to farming, mining and shoemaking, is closed in winter and rarely opens on Saturdays during summer months. ‘At the moment we mill about half a ton of flour a month in the summer and sell it to six shops but we could easily sell to 60,’ says Sara, 55, a former magazine  editor. ‘If we were staying I’d also like to convert the gift shop into a bakery.’ Artifacts: The Wayside Museum which celebrates farming, mining and homemaking, was opened in 1937 and has 5,000 items on display . Back in 2002, the house needed extensive repairs, which cost £60,000. ‘The previous owner had poured concrete down the chimney to block it and it took three weeks to dig it out. There was a lot of other structural work – we had new doors made, laid a stone floor in the kitchen and put in new central heating and a sewage treatment plant,’ says Bob. He seems most proud of the watermill, which was restored in 2009. The couple started milling the following year. The museum was started in 1937 by a former colonel in the Indian Army with a special interest in primitive farming methods, and it has a great reputation, drawing in people from around the globe. ‘Our oldest pieces are grinding querns from about 3,000BC – there are three in the British Museum, but we’ve got 12,’ says Sara. ‘However, the most talked-about piece is a Fifties Hotpoint Princess washing machine.’ The site attracts 10,000 visitors a year, including ironing enthusiasts, drawn not just to early charcoal models but also to a modern Morphy Richards. Yet one of the couple’s biggest tasks is turning pieces away. ‘People bring artefacts to us all the time but we just don’t have the space,’ says Bob. Since the business went up for sale for £895,000, it has attracted interest from the National Trust. A spokesman says: ‘Wayside Museum and its regionally and nationally important collection must rank as one of the most outstanding potential archaeological acquisitions that we have considered for a long time.’ Unfortunately, the Trust does not have funds to buy it. Two other offers have since come in from people wanting to split and sell the collection, which the Priddles rejected. ‘We don’t have a legal obligation to run the museum but we do have a personal one. And if we did decide to put everything on eBay, the villagers would lynch us,’ jokes Sara. The property sits in a delightful village. Zennor, famed for a legend about a mermaid who is said to have swum up a local river and appeared in the village church, is a ten-minute walk from the sea. When the Priddles do find a buyer, they won’t be going far. ‘When we came here from Exeter, our eldest two children were finishing university and only our youngest, Katie, who was about to start a degree  at University College London, came with us,’ says Bob. ‘She later met and married the son of the farmer next door and she’s due to give birth to their third child in August, so we want to be near our grandchildren.’ Beardsley Theobalds 01392 253071; beardsleytheobalds.co.uk .","Wayside Museum was started in 1937 and celebrates rural life in Cornwall .

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday warned state and local health officials about potential infections from a deadly virus previously unseen in humans that has now sickened 14 people and killed 8. Most of the infections have occurred in the Middle East, but a new analysis of three confirmed infections in Britain suggests the virus can pass from person to person rather than from animal to humans, the CDC said in its Weekly Morbidity and Mortality Report on Thursday. The virus is a coronavirus, part of the same family of viruses as the common cold and the deadly outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that first emerged in Asia in 2003. The new virus is not the same as SARS, but like the SARS virus, it is similar to those found in bats. The CDC is warning state and local health officials about potential infections from a deadly virus previously unseen in humans that has now sickened 14 people and killed 8 . Spread: At the same time, the CDC is also issuing warnings about the spread of 'superbugs' in U.S. hospitals that are resistant to antibiotics . So far, no cases have been reported in the United States. According to the CDC's analysis, the infections in Britain started with a . 60-year-old man who had recently traveled to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia . and developed a respiratory illness on January 24, 2013. Samples from . the man showed he was infected with both the new virus and with H1N1, or . swine flu.

Samples from the man showed . he was infected with both the new virus and with H1N1, or swine flu. This man subsequently passed the . infection to two members of his household: a male with an underlying . illness who became ill on February 6 and subsequently died; and a . healthy adult female in his household who developed a respiratory . illness on February 5, but who did not need to be hospitalized and has . recovered. The CDC said people who develop a . severe acute lower respiratory illness within 10 days of returning from . the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries should continue to be . evaluated according to current guidelines. The health agency said doctors should . be watchful of patients who develop an unexplained respiratory . infection within 10 days of traveling from the Arabian Peninsula or . neighboring countries. Symptoms of infection with this new virus include severe acute . respiratory illness with fever, cough and shortness of breath. Neither . the CDC nor the World Health Organization has issued travel restrictions . related to the virus. Weakening: Many antibiotics are now unable to kill the resistant strains of bacteria . Warnings of the deadly virus come as . the CDC announced concerns over an increasing number of infections from a . 'nightmare bacteria' found in U.S. hospitals. Public health officials have warned . that in a growing number of cases existing antibiotics do not work . against the superbug, Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Patients became infected with the . bacteria in nearly four per cent of US hospitals and in almost 18 per . cent of specialist medical facilities in the first half of 2012, . according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Dr Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, . said in a statement that the strongest antibiotics 'don't work and . patients are left with potentially untreatable infections.' He said scientists were 'raising the alarm' over the problem following increasing concern. Increasing numbers of patients in US . hospitals have become infected with CRE, which kills up to half of . patients who get bloodstream infections from them, according to a new . CDC report. Some of the more than 70 types of . Enterobacteriaceae bacteria - including E-coli - have become gradually . resistant over a long period of time, even to so-called, 'last resort . drugs' called carbapenem. During the last 10 years, the . percentage of Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to these last-ditch . antibiotics rose by 400 percent. One type of CRE has increased by a . factor of seven over the last decade, Fox News reports. CRE infections usually affect patients . being treated for serious conditions in hospitals, long-term acute-care . facilities and nursing homes.

Theresa May has pledged to scrap the Human Rights Act if the Conservatives win the next election . Defiant Theresa May yesterday stepped up her campaign to become Tory leader by confirming her plan for the UK to break free of the shackles of European judges. She also suggested smashing the ‘state monopoly’ of schools and hospitals by letting them make a profit – and demanded a new crackdown on unions. Labour accused the Home Secretary of revealing a ‘secret Right-wing agenda’ to privatise education and the NHS, and to attack unions. And they said quitting the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) would backfire. In a speech at Westminster dubbed her personal ‘leadership May-nifesto’, Mrs May said if the Conservatives were to regain popularity, they had to produce ‘radical’ new policies. Her comments reinforce claims by her allies who say she is on course to follow in the footsteps of Britain’s first female Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Mrs May’s proposal that the UK must consider quitting the ECHR was first revealed by this newspaper last week. Throughout the week, she refused to comment on the matter, as a feud erupted between her Tory supporters and opponents. It also fuelled claims that she is secretly preparing a leadership challenge if David Cameron loses the next General Election, due in 2015. An increasingly confident Mrs May broke her silence at a Tory rally yesterday. It was time to stop criminals getting off scot-free because of human rights laws, she said, declaring: ‘All options – including leaving the ECHR altogether – should be on the table.’ Adopting the mantle of ‘the new Maggie’, Mrs May said it was time to consider boosting standards in education and health by letting schools and hospitals make a profit. Aides denied it amounted to privatisation, pointing out schools and hospitals would continue to be ‘free at the point of use’. Mrs May said the case of hate preacher Abu Qatada, who was denied bail at his latest hearing today, highlighted the need for Britain to change its human rights laws . On quitting the Strasbourg-based . ECHR, Mrs May said: ‘We need to stop human rights legislation . interfering with our ability to fight crime and control immigration. ‘That’s why the next Conservative Government will scrap the Human Rights Act.’ To cheers from Tory activists, she . continued: ‘We should also consider very carefully our relationship with . the ECHR and the Convention it enforces. ‘When Strasbourg constantly moves the . goalposts and prevents the deportation of dangerous men like Abu . Qatada, we have to ask ourselves, to what end are we signatories to the . Convention? Are we really limiting human rights abuses in other . countries? I’m sceptical.’ It undermined Britain’s national interest and its own Supreme Court, the Home Secretary maintained. ‘By 2015 we’ll need a plan for . dealing with the European Court of Human Rights. And yes, I want to be . clear that all options – including leaving the Convention altogether – . should be on the table.’ Similar drastic measures to improve public services should be studied, she said. The Coalition had already given parents and patients more choice but had not gone far enough, Mrs May insisted. Tory MP Peter Bone said that Theresa May's speech 'went down very well' ‘I expect our reform agenda to become . even more radical. Yes, the State should make sure that public services . are  available to all and free at the point of use. ‘Yes, the State should regulate those services to make sure they’re provided everywhere and offer high standards. ‘But too often the State is a poor . provider of services, and its monopoly over the delivery of those . services must end. A future Conservative Government should increase the . number of charities, companies and co-operatives that deliver frontline . services. ‘If allowing them to make a profit . means we have a more diverse supply side and better outcomes, then we . should consider it with an open mind.’ Mrs May dismissed claims that people ‘don’t want choice, they just want better services’. She said: ‘Why should choice be the preserve of the rich, who can afford to go private? ‘Why is it assumed that wealthy parents and patients are capable of making choices, while nobody else is? ‘It will be left to the Conservatives . to break the state monopoly, to open up public services, and give . everybody – not just the rich – the freedom to choose what is right for . themselves and their families.’ Mrs May also called for new curbs on . unions. She said: ‘It’s not just freedom from the State we need to think . about. We need to think about freedom from vested interests. That means . taking on trade unions resistant to change.’ Last night Tory MP Peter Bone said: . ‘There is no vacancy at the moment but clearly in the future, the Home . Secretary will be a very credible candidate. ‘She has run her department very well . and it’s extraordinarily difficult to be Home Secretary. She has . handled it very well. She has widespread support in the party. ‘Her views on human rights rules and reports that she wants to pull out of the ECHR went down very well with party members.’ By ROBERT VERKAIK, Legal Affairs Editor . A pensions row has broken out between top judges, including Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, and the Government . The wealthiest judges in the country . are using human rights laws to challenge the Government over cuts to . their gold-plated pensions worth hundreds of millions of pounds. A secret dossier leaked to The Mail on Sunday reveals how Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice and . Britain’s most senior judge, is spearheading an unprecedented attack on the Government’s authority over public finances. Judges have instructed top barristers to advise them on using human rights laws to sue Ministers who have reduced pensions in line with those paid to senior civil servants. In the past, judges have not contributed to a pension that pays them half their former salary plus a lump sum pay-off. The changes will result in them contributing for the first time and paying tax on the income the pensions provide. The 100-page dossier exposes the ferocity of the dispute between the Government and the judiciary which could spark a constitutional crisis. In one draft of a letter intended for the Lord Chancellor, Chris  Grayling, the judges use the threat of court action to try to get their way. ‘It would be in nobody’s interest for these issues to be resolved by litigation .  .  . however, you will understand that the possibility of recourse to the courts cannot be ruled out.’ Judges earn up to up £240,000 a year. Lord Judge’s annual pension will be £119,922 and he will get a lump sum payment of more than £250,000 when he retires later this year.Lib Dem MP John Hemming questioned how the case could be properly heard in court. He said: ‘Natural justice requires people do not sit in judgment in their own case. It is difficult to see how an application by the judiciary to quash changes to their own pension payments can be handled without a conflict of interest.’ Neither the senior judiciary nor the Government would comment on the matter.","...And fuels leadership speculation with radical 'privatised schools' plan .

This may be smoke without a fire - or it could be we are about to get an announcement which will fundamentally change our knowledge of the universe. The physics world has been set alight with a wildfire rumour that CERN will announce they have discovered the Higgs boson particle - that elusive 'God' particle which is believed to give all other particles their mass. Even Twitter went crazy for the elusive particle, with #HiggsRumour at the top of the Top Trending lists on Wednesday. The particle accelerator: It is within these tubes that physicists are hunting for the 'God' particle . Physics blogger Peter Woit, who writes . for Not Even Wrong, started the discussions, saying that CERN had . replicated last year's study which seemed to spot the particle. This year's result saw the same spiking as the tests last year, indicating last year's result were not a mistake or aberration. Woit write: 'To oversimplify the . situation, last year both experiments were seeing roughly a 3 sigma . excess in gamma-gamma around 125 GeV.' While Woit says this is . oversimplifying matters, this may still be a but too much for anyone . without an advanced desgree in particle physics. The even simpler form is that in 2011, . CERN was hoping to see spikes in their two experiments, which would . offer evidence to support the hypothetical particle. And these spikes . did occur. Woit continues: 'This was enough to . convince many people that it was highly likely that this was the Higgs. However, that size excess is not completely convincing, it is not . unheard of for there to be statistical flukes of such size. 'The 2012 data that is being analysed... is of a similar size to the 2011 data. 'If 2011 was a fluke, you expect to see nothing much around 125 GeV in the 2012 data. 'If the 2011 signal really was the . Higgs you expect the signal to strengthen. What I’m hearing from both . experiments is that they are seeing an excess in the new data, . strengthening the significance of the signal.'

The Collider Blog's Michael Schmitt added: 'As a member of the CMS Collaboration, I know precisely what we have.

A murderer who repeatedly stabbed a mother-of-three was able to collect pictures of his victim and boast about his deed to prison inmates, it has been claimed. The revelation, which exposes how murderers and rapists in Britain's prisons are able to collect pictures of their victims' bodies, came to light following a claim by a former inmate at Belmarsh Prison, in south east London, who said killer Reece Ludlow boasted of murdering Louisa Brannan, according to the Sunday Mirror. The Ministry of Justice has ordered a review following reports which suggested inmates were free to access pictures in legal files, which they were then able to share with other prisoners. Reece Ludlow (left), who was jailed for life in July last year for killing Louisa Brannan (right), was said to have been showing other inmates images of the mother-of-three . Ludlow was jailed for life in July last year for killing Ms Brannan by beating her over the head with a frying pan and stabbing her 25 times with two knives in 2011. Ludlow picked up Ms Brannan at a pub and they had sex at his flat in Sutton, south London, before the brutal murder. He then attacked her before phoning his ex-girlfriend, who he said he had not got over, to tell her what he had done. His horrified former girlfriend could hear Ms Brannan, from Huddersfield, screaming 'I'm dying' in the background. Ludlow had admitted manslaughter but denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He was relying on two psychiatric reports from doctors, but they withdrew their support and he admitted murder moments before he was to give evidence in his defence. General view of the high security prison, HMP Belmarsh, in Thamesmead, east London . According to the Sunday Mirror report, Ludlow moved to another jail in October 2011. Ms Brannan's father David Brannan told the paper he could not believe Ludlow had the photos in his possession. He said: 'It's hard enough coping with my daughter's murder, never mind finding out he's bragging about killing her. 'It's a disgusting thought and I can't believe it's allowed.' 'The Secretary of State for Justice is . extremely concerned about prisoners possessing material such as photos . of victims or crime scenes as part of their legal papers' - MoJ spokesman . Solicitor advoctate Julian Young told the Sunday Mirror criminals were given a copy of a case file, which included pictures, if they asked for it. Indecent images and video-recorded interviews with vulnerable witnesses would be among certain evidence which would not be provided. He said: 'The case file is the client's property for the rest of his life and you cannot stop him showing photos to anyone.' The paper reported Ludlow's solicitor as . being surprised by the claims, as during the case he had refused to . look at the pictures. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'The Secretary of State for Justice is extremely concerned about prisoners possessing material such as photos of victims or crime scenes as part of their legal papers.

A baby left fighting for life was saved by his mother’s cuddle - and has stunned doctors by taking his first steps. Adam Cheshire was just a day old when he stopped breathing and started suffering violent seizures due to a brain infection. He slipped into a coma and was placed on a life support machine while doctors battled to save him. Doctors were convinced Adam Cheshire wouldn't survive, but he showed signs of life after a cuddle from his mother (left). He is making good progress 16months on (right) Parents Charlotte and Chris from Telford, Shropshire, were told to say their goodbyes and to take a final photograph of their son. Yet, Adam started showing signs of life after a cuddle from his mother. The 16-month-old boy’s recovery has been described as a ‘miracle’ and now Adam has taken his first steps. Mrs Cheshire, 34, said: 'They were convinced he was going to die. His entire body started to shut down. He was blue and shaking with convulsions. 'For a number of days, I was only allowed to gently stroke Adam’s leg or arm before they encouraged me to hold and cuddle him. 'They told me skin-to-skin contact is very important. Your baby needs to know you are there. 'Adam is our miracle. He just refused to give up.' Adam was born at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital in Shropshire, weighing a healthy 7lb 3oz. But the next day, Charlotte noticed he was making a strange grunting noise and wouldn’t feed. Midwives realised something was wrong and took Adam away for tests. Adam pictured with his parents Chris and Charlotte and brother George . Adam suffered violent seizures after birth due to a brain infection . Charlotte, who is training to be a vicar, said: 'Shortly after, I tried to get out  of bed and was suddenly in agonising pain. 'After helping me back into bed, doctors diagnosed me with a full pelvic split, which meant all the bones in my pelvis had separated from each other. I couldn’t even walk. 'Chris had left the hospital about an hour earlier to get some rest after the long night of helping me through labour. 'He had only just got home when I rang him in tears to say that Adam had been taken away because he was sick.' Chris, 47, a systems engineer, raced back to the hospital to find Adam was in neonatal intensive care, where he had collapsed and had stopped breathing. His organs began to shut down and he was having constant seizures. Doctors put Adam on a ventilator to breathe for him and kept him an induced coma. Three days later, Adam was diagnosed with Group B Strep Meningitis. Pregnant women can transmit the disease to their newborns at birth. Babies who survive can be left with speech, hearing, and vision problems as well as being permanently disabled. Charlotte said: 'A doctor came to see me to explain that while Adam was still alive and that they would do their best to treat him, that his life was very much in danger. By then, I was determined to go and see him. 'It took two hours to get me into a wheelchair lined with pillows, but despite my tears, I refused to give up. 'I’ll never forget how I felt looking into that incubator for the first time. He had more wires attached to his tiny body than I have ever seen. 'The midwife told us to take a photo and we feared it would be the only one we ever had of our son.' Charlotte at eight months pregnant. Unbeknownst to her, she had Strep B which she had transmitted to her son . Over the next week, Charlotte and Chris could only watch while their son fought for life. They were warned that even if Adam lived, he could be brain damaged, epileptic, suffer cerebral palsy and a range of other disabilities.But he refused to give up. His breathing slowly improved and a few days later, doctors were able to take him off the ventilator. On Mothering Sunday, Charlotte was finally able to hold her son for the first time since he had been ill and Adam opened his eyes for the first time. Over the next few days, she spent up to twelve hours a day sitting in a rocking chair while Adam slept in her arms. After being fed tiny amounts of milk through a tube for the first few weeks of his life, Adam began to breastfeed. Skin-to-skin contact, also known as the ‘kangaroo care’ technique after the way kangaroos hold their young in a pouch next to their bodies, means the mother acts as a human incubator to keep babies warm, stimulated and fed. Charlotte said: 'It was incredibly traumatic to be separated from Adam. It felt fabulous to hold him in my arms. 'The moment he opened his eyes was incredible. I knew that if he was waking up, he would survive. 'In tiny, baby steps, Adam began to grow stronger. His seizures reduced and then stopped. His first MRI came back with some small spots of brightness which appeared to indicate brain damage, but it was too early to tell.' Charlotte and her family handover the money raised by the sponsored walk for the hospital that saved Adam . However, after three weeks in hospital, Adam, who has a hearing impairment, was well enough to go home to be with his parents and step-brother, George, ten. A more recent MRI scan showed most of the brightness that indicated brain injury had disappeared. Charlotte said: 'It’s been a continuing journey. We are so proud of him.Adam recently took his first steps unaided. It’s another tick of the check list. Everything he does is incredibly amazing. 'We cannot fault the care we received at the hospital and the support we have been given. We would like to thank them all from the bottom of our hearts.' The couple are now backing the Group B Strep Support’s petition asking for routine group B Streptococcus testing for pregnant women on the NHS. Charlotte said: 'Group B Strep is very common in the UK as one in four women in the UK are carriers. It can be quickly and easily detected with a swab test between 35-37 weeks of pregnancy. 'If detected it can be treated with antibiotics during labour but the NHS currently don’t test for it. 'By sharing my story, I hope more women know about GBS and can therefore prevent going through experiences like ours.'Cathy Smith, head of Midwifery at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said: 'Adam received intensive care support on the Trust’s neonatal unit after being born and was cared for by our paediatric doctors and nurses until he was well enough to go home. 'We are grateful for the support his family has shown through their fundraising efforts for the unit. 'One in three women carry Group B Strep (GBS). The majority of babies born to these women will not be affected. However, there is a small risk that GBS can pass to the baby during childbirth. Very occasionally this causes an infection in the baby which requires additional care. 'Skin-to-skin contact, or kangaroo care, is a beneficial way of helping a baby bond with its parents, especially if mum is breastfeeding. This contact can help the baby relax, improve temperature control and regulate the heartbeat. 'It must be remembered that every case is different, however, and when caring for premature or sick babies treatment plans are made on an individual basis.'

Distraught owner Jodie Robertson, 21, took her beloved pet Bobbie to the vets fearing the worst after he limped through the cat flap in agony on Saturday morning. The three-year-old cat had been shot by a thug at point blank range causing his thigh bone to explode into 20 separate pieces. Miracle: Bobbie the cat had his leg 'blown to smithereens' by a yob who blasted him with a pellet gun but has now made a recovery. He is pictured with owner Jodie Robertson . Wounded: This X-Ray image shows the cat's wound. After being shot, the pet's thigh bone exploded into 20 separate pieces . The pet underwent a 90 minute operation where vets pieced his leg and thigh back together using pins and even glue to seal the bone. Incredibly, just 24 hours after surgery, Bobbie was back home with Jodie at her home in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. Today, furious Miss Robertson, a petrol station cashier, slammed the yob who targeted her beloved pet. She fumed: 'It's disgusting. I'm so shocked that anyone could do that to a defenceless animal. 'I can't really describe it in words. It's horrific. I just hope they catch whoever has done this.' Angry  Miss Robertson, who has had Bobbie since he was seven-weeks-old, had to take out a £1,000 loan to pay for his operation. Brave: Bobbie underwent a 90 minute operation where vets pieced his leg and thigh back together using pins and even glue to seal the bone. Vet Graham Oliver is pictured with the cat . Recovery: Incredibly, just 24 hours after surgery, Bobbie was back home with Jodie at her home in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire . She added: 'Other pet owners might not be able to take out a loan like I did, so they would just have to part with their best friend.' Vet Graham Oliver, who operated on Bobbie at Buckley House Vets in Nottingham, said the pellet went through the cat's right buttock. He said: 'It's a particularly horrific injury that he's suffered. 'The pellet has gone in through the right buttock, grazed his sciatic nerve and caused the top of the thigh bone to explode into about 20 pieces. 'We often see cats with pellets in and occasionally they lose an eye or suffer a broken bone, but this must have been done at close range as the energy caused by the impact caused the bone to be blown to smithereens. Tough: The cat is pictured taking some medicine at home . 'We used an interlocking nail to repair the joints. It involved inserting a pin down into the bone and a bracket into the outer part of the leg. 'We managed to piece the other bits of bone back together again like a jigsaw. 'Similar operations usually take about 40 minutes but this one took an hour-and-a-half, it was quite an intricate process.' The RSPCA is now appealing for anyone who has any information about the shooting to come forward. A spokeswoman said: 'It is absolutely vital that if anyone saw anything suspicious or knows of anyone shooting at animals in the area that they come forward with information. 'People cannot be allowed to get away with causing such awful injuries.' A spokesperson for Nottinghamshire Police added: 'The misuse of an air or pellet weapon in a bid to cause harm can lead to arrest and prosecution.'","Owner Jodie Robertson feared the worst after beloved pet .

Just one in 10 people realise that a persistent cough could be a key symptom of lung cancer, according to statistics released by the Government as it launches a campaign to raise awareness about the disease. Despite the condition killing more people than any other form of cancer in England, very few people are aware a cough lasting three weeks is a sign of a potential sufferer. An advertising drive backed by actor Ricky . Gervais and TV presenter Jenny Frost will be launched tomorrow in a bid to . raise awareness about the issue and improve earlier diagnosis in . England. Actor Ricky Gervais and singer Jenny Frost are both backing the Government's 'Be Clear on Cancer' campaign, after both lost a parent to lung cancer . It is hoped Be Clear on Cancer campaign will help save around 1,300 lives a year. Health . Minister Paul Burstow said: 'Lung cancer is the biggest cancer killer . in this country but worryingly many people don't know the signs and . symptoms that could save their lives. 'The earlier lung cancer is diagnosed, the better the chance of survival. 'The message from this campaign is simple; if you have a persistent cough for three weeks or more, visit your GP.' Lung cancer affects 33,000 people every year in England with the majority of cases occurring in people over the age of 55. When diagnosed at its earliest stage, . as many as 80 per cent of people are alive five years after diagnosis compared . with only seven per cent diagnosed at a late stage. Manchester United captain Sir Alex Ferguson lost both his mother and father to lung cancer, while Lynda Bellingham lost her sister . The . campaign is being supported by a host of stars, many of whom have been . touched personally by the disease. Manchester United captain Sir Alex . Ferguson, 70, lost both parents to lung cancer. He told the . Manchester Evening News: 'My father was 66 when he died and my mother . was only 64. Dad was diagnosed with lung cancer only a week after he . retired and within 12 months it had killed him. 'Then my mum, who had smoked all her life, was diagnosed with lung cancer as well and she passed away a few years after my dad.' Actor Ricky Gervais, who lost his mother to lung cancer when she was 74, said the condition was 'devastating'. 'It's a horrible, horrible disease,' he said. Singer Jenny Frost cancelled her wedding in 2010 after her mother Rita succumbed to lung cancer. Other . celebrity supporters include actor Robert Powell, author Tony Parsons and actress Terry Dwyer who lost their fathers and Dragon Duncan Bannatyne . who lost his mother. I'm A Celebrity star Stephanie Powers and writer Cassandra Jardine battled the disease themselves. Campaign backers: Sir Alex Ferguson, Stephanie Powers, Tony Parsons and (bottom row) Linda Robson, Mark Lawrenson and Cassandra Jardine . The campaign follows an awareness-raising pilot in the Midlands . in October last year. This showed improved knowledge of lung cancer and increased confidence in recognising the symptoms. There . was a 23 per cent increase in attendance to primary care. Based on a . sample of trusts, there was an increase in referrals for chest x rays . and chest CT scans compared with the same period in the previous year.

We have made early diagnosis central to our Cancer Outcomes Strategy. 'Earlier diagnosis of Lung Cancer combined with the best treatments could help save an additional 1,300 lives a year.'

It has been more than 200 years since the French managed to land an invading naval force on Britain's shores. But today saw hundreds of armed troops along with 43 vehicles, four helicopters, two landing craft and a catamaran, stormed a beach in Gosport, Hampshire. The sight would have been the stuff of nightmares for Admiral Lord Nelson as scores of Frenchmen emerged from the sea clutching their rifles. Shoot alors! A French assault craft approaches a beach at Browndown in Hampshire . Large fleet: Hundreds of troops stormed the beach along with 43 vehicles, four helicopters, two landing craft and a catamaran . Closer relations: The is the first time French troops have trained using a beach in the UK . But far from being a serious assault on the scale of a Napoleonic invasion, this was a unique training exercise for the French military. The last time French troops landed on British soil was during the Battle of Fishguard - also known as the 'last invasion of Britain' - in 1797. Today's exercise signalled the first time French forces have trained using a UK beach, signalling the ever-closer co-operation between London and Paris in the wake of the 2010 defence treaty signed by David Cameron and ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy. The task force landed at Browndown camp in Gosport, Hampshire, which was part-built by French prisoners of war during the early 19th century. Working together: The training exercise comes after Britain and France signed a defence treaty in 2010 . Training: Armoured cars drive on the beach after a catamaran brought them ashore during the exercise . Ready for battle: This scene would have been a nightmare for Admiral Lord Nelson who spent his life protecting Britain's shores . The amphibious landing helicopter ship, FS Tonnerre, and its anti-submarine warfare destroyer, FS Georges Leygues, conducted exercises out in the Solent from 2pm while aircraft buzzed in the grey skies overhead. Speaking ahead of the invasion, a French navy spokeswoman said: 'Once the vehicles and soldiers disembark, using the landing craft and helicopters, the troops will continue with instruction activities, driver training, live fire exercises and assault course on Browndown. 'This kind of manoeuvre is a unique chance for the 134 midshipmen of the French Naval Academy 2010-class embarked onboard the Tonnerre and the Georges Leygues to discover both amphibious and joint operations.' After their stay on the south coast, the roving task force will travel to the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, where they will take part in an European anti-piracy operation before visiting Chinese waters. Armed and ready: The troops took part in driver training, live fire exercises and had to complete an assault course at Browndown camp . Sac le bleu: The naval force spent the day training at the Browndown camp in Gosport, Hampshire, which was part-built by French prisoners of war during the early 19th century . The last time French troops landed on British soil was during the Battle of Fishguard - also known as the 'last invasion of Britain' - in 1797. The invasion was the plan of French General Lazare Hoche, who had devised a three-pronged attack on Britain in support of Irish Republicans under Wolfe Tone. Two forces would land in Britain as a diversionary effort, while the main body would land in Ireland. While poor weather and indiscipline halted two of the forces, the third, aimed at landing in Wales and marching on Bristol, went ahead. The invasion force consisted of 1,400 troops from the La Legion Noire (The Black Legion) under the command of Irish American Colonel William Tate, 800 of whom were irregulars. Transported on four French warships under the command of Commodore Jean-Joseph Castagnier, Tate's forces landed at Carregwastad Head near Fishguard on 22 February. Upon landing discipline broke down amongst the irregulars, many of whom deserted to loot nearby settlements. The remaining troops were met by a quickly assembled group of around 500 British reservists, militia and sailors under the command of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor. After brief clashes with the local civilian population and Lord Cawdor's forces on 23 February, Tate was forced into an unconditional surrender by 24 February. Later, the British captured two of the expedition's vessels, a frigate and a corvette. Despite all this, Castagnier managed to return to France.","French 'invasion' of a beach in Gosport, Hampshire, was a training exercise .

At a slaughterhouse in a small Javanese village, Wakira confidently handles a large hissing cobra.

Wakira, known as Boss Cobra, is the owner of a slaughterhouse that produces snake meat and skin. He employs ten workers and earns up to 15 million rupiah ($ 1,562, £1,000) a month from the factory's production. At his factory in Kapetakan village near Cirebon, Indonesia's West Java province he produces snakeskin to make products such as bags, shoes, wallets and belts.

Abused: Leisha Brookes claims Jimmy Savile and other men attacked at the BBC TV 's White City HQ . A woman has vowed to go to jail rather than pay her TV licence because she claimed she was abused by Jimmy Savile and 35 other men at the BBC's headquarters. Magistrates listened in shocked silence as 45-year-old Leisha Brookes explained why she would not pay the £145.50 fee. She said: 'No matter what you fine me , I am not going to give a penny to my abusers from the BBC. I cannot pay the BBC or anyone connected with it.' The repeated abuse by the disgraced DJ and the men, happened over two years at the BBC TV headquarters in White City, west London, when she was about nine years old, she claimed. Speaking to the Sunday Express Miss Brookes revealed how she was abused after a cameraman friend of her family introduced her to the former Jim'll Fix It presenter. He allegedly abused her at his home, taking naked pictures of her when she spent weekends with him after tricking her family into letting her stay. The cameraman took her repeatedly to visit his workplace as a 'treat' so she could meet the stars of the day and see where programmes were made. She told the paper: ' At the time Jim’ll Fix It was massive . and I told him I wanted to be on the show. He said, ‘I can do even . better than that. I can get you to meet Jimmy Savile any time you want’. Disgraced: Jimmy Savile abused Leisha Brookes when she was nine-year-old, she claims .

She produced documents for the magistrates at Colchester proving that she had given evidence to police as part of Operation Yewtree investigation into Savile and other suspected paedophiles . Waiving her right to ­anonymity, Miss Brookes said the abuse had wrecked her life, leading to mental health problems and suicide attempts. Eventually her five children were put into care. She had been fined three times by courts over the past seven years for failing to have a TV licence, previously blaming 'personal reasons' for her refusal to pay. She was found guilty and fined £50 with a surcharge of £20, giving her 28 days to pay.

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 09:28 EST, 29 December 2011 . The new tax will add just over 1p to a can of fizzy drink such as Coca-Cola . France has approved a 'fat tax' on sugary soft drinks in a bid to combat soaring child obesity and boost state coffers. The new tax will add just over 1p to a can of fizzy drink like Coca-Cola or Fanta but zero-calorie 'diet' drinks will be exempt from the charges, the government said. The new measures - a hike of from 3 to 6 Euro cents per litre on sugary drinks - are also expected to raise more than £100million a year for government coffers. The revenue would be used to fund lower social security charges for farm workers, the government said. France's Constitutional Council approved the new soda tax yesterday after it was announced in . August. However, the tax has been slammed by beverage firms including Coca-Cola, which in . September said it was suspending a planned 17-million-euro investment . at a plant in the south of France in 'a symbolic protest against a tax . that punishes our company and stigmatises our products'. The move comes after France also announced it would be rationing tomato ketchup and salt in school canteens. Under the rules, tomato sauce and mayonnaise will only be on dinner tables once a week when chips are served and would be removed when traditional French dishes such as roast veal are served. Denmark also recently announced a new higher tax on foods containing high levels of saturated fat. A recent study found a fast-food diet of junk food is turning the traditionally skinny French into a nation of fatties. More than 20 million French people are now overweight and seven million of those are clinically obese - double the figure for 14 years ago, according to France's National Institute for Health and Medical Research. Despite still being officially Europe's second thinnest people, the weight of the average French person has soared by half a stone to 11 stone 4lbs since 1997, the report found. Obesity: Government's are now tackling excessive weight gain in their populations and are targeting sugary drinks. France is bringing in measures to ration mayonnaise and tomato ketchup in schools . A French health ministry spokesman said in October: 'We French may be among the least overweight in Europe but we have nothing to be complacent about. 'Obesity is rising as swiftly in France as it is in other EU countries and action must be taken before it gets any more serious.' Europe's fattest nation is Greece, where 70 per cent of people are overweight, and 30 per cent are obese. Britons are Europe's fifth fattest, behind Germany, Finland and Ireland, according to a TNS Sofres survey of 500,000 people across the EU. The NHS defines being overweight as having a body mass index - your weight to height ratio - of between 25 and 30, and obese as over 30.","Tax is expected to rake in £100m for state coffers .

Celebrity chef Aldo Zilli unveiled the world's most expensive kitchen last night - complete with a Swarovski Crystal chandelier, solid copper walls and handcrafted appliances. The 'Fiore di Cristallo' kitchen, by leading designer Claudio Celiberti, took more than a year to craft from the pure crystal of Murano and the finest stone. But such luxurious cooking space comes with an eight-month waiting list because of the bespoke design work involved and a hefty pricetag of $1.6m. Height of luxury: The $1.6m 'Fiore di Cristallo' kitchen is the creation of designer Claudio Celiberti and was unveiled by celebrity chef Aldo Zilli in London's Mayfair on Thursday . Extravagant: The world's most expensive kitchen comes with an eight-month waiting list. The centrepiece is a $58,750 'island' made from solid Murano crystal . Illuminating: The kitchen comes equipped with a $42,000 bespoke Swarovski chandelier, which projects light to bounce off the cut crystal cabinet fronts and worktops . The kitchen was launched at an exclusive party co-hosted by Mr Zilli at One Mayfair in London. Buyers can choose opulent finishing touches, including copper lining, on the 27 cabinets, which cost over $700,000 to design and come with a 9mm crystal door and handle. The centrepiece is a unique 'crystal island' worth $58,750 illuminated by a $42,000 Swarovski chandelier. The basin is also made from crystal and costs $4,200, while the Philip Starck taps, chrome clad in crystal, are valued at $2,300. Then you'll need a stretch of stone worktop at $10,900 and some handcrafted German appliances from Gaggenau at $38,250. The fridge alone is $7,960, while extras including a wine climate cabinet and an espresso coffee machine are $4,400 and $2,730 respectively. Opulence: The basin is worth $4,200 and comes fitted with $2,550 chrome taps clad in crystal by Philip Starck. The appliances, meanwhile, are custom made by the German company Gaggenau and will cost $38,250. This doesn't include the fridge ($7,960), wine cabinet ($4,400) or the coffee machine ($2,730) however . Crystal classy: All of the 27 cabinets in the 'Fiore di Cristallo' come fitted with Murano crystal handled and are fronted with a 9mm thick crystal door . Its designers say the kitchen 'aims to push the boundaries of what is possible in design' and is the 'perfect masterpiece using striking design qualities, exquisite natural materials and fine craftsmanship.' The 'Fiore di Cristallo' on display last night is currently the only model available in the world but prospective buyers who want the kitchen designed to their needs must join the eight-month queue. Speaking at the launch, Mr Zilli said: 'Claudio, in my mind, is an inspiration to all interior designers out there, whether you're designing a kitchen, a whole house and indeed one of my restaurants. 'As far as I am concerned this kitchen, the 'Fiore di Cristallo,' to me is the equivalent of a kilo of white truffles on my pasta. 'In other words, Claudio has combined innovative design with functionality faultlessly. This is ultimate luxury at its best.' Top design: Like this fridge, the cabinets can be encased in copper, which is regarded as one of the most hygienic kitchen materials because it counteracts microbes . Culinary partnership: The kitchen's designer Claudio Celiberti (left) with famous chef Aldo Zilli at the launch of the luxury kitchen in Mayfair last night .

Mr Celiberti said: 'As a visionary designer who is committed to perfection, I wanted to create a bespoke space that pushed boundaries, exemplified beauty and defined ultimate luxury. 'The end result is a kitchen that is not only functional but also a work of art with each cut, component and flourish being nothing short of perfection, even down to the finest detail.' The name derives from the 'Cristallo di Murano', the world famous gems made using a complex and closely guarded technique on the Italian island of Murano. Copper linings were chosen because the mineral is acknowledged to have hygienic qualities as it counteracts harmful microbes. The chandelier is specially designed to bounce light off the reflective crystal surfaces on the worktops, drawing attention to the kitchen.","The Claudio Celiberti-designed kitchen, which comes with a $58,750 solid Murano crystal 'Island' and 27 crystal-fronted cabinets, costs $1.6m .

Preferred: Lynda La Plante claimed Paul Abbott was favoured over her - despite the Shameless creator barely working for the BBC since State Of Play aired in 2003 . Three years ago she complained the Corporation would rather opt for a Muslim teenager’s script over hers, saying: ‘If my name were Usafi Iqbadal and I was 19, then they’d probably bring me in and talk.’ However, her complaints about  Mr Abbott seem misplaced as the Burnley-born writer has barely worked for the BBC since his political thriller State Of Play aired in 2003. He was commissioned to write a second series in 2006 but it was abandoned. He wrote the three-part BBC1 mini-series Exile two years ago, and a one-off drama for BBC3. Miss La Plante has previously complained it took ‘a retinue of people’ to get in touch with ‘the god Ben Stephenson’ – the BBC’s head of drama commissioning.

After two months of celebrations, the world's biggest religious festival the Kumbh Mela has come to an end. The festival is celebrated every 12 years at the conjunction of two sacred rivers on the outskirts of the northern Indian city of Allahabad.

Britain’s cheapest car goes on sale next year, for the same price as go-faster stripes on a Ferrari. The new Dacia Sandero will cost from just £5,995 when it arrives in the UK in January, a similar amount to some luxury options on the world’s priciest cars. A . similar sum will pay for racing stripes on a Ferrari 599 (£5,250), . pearlescent white paint on a Maserati Quattroporte (£5,400) or . carbon-ceramic brakes on a Porsche 911 (£5,464). SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bargain: The new Dacia Sandero will be retail from under £6,000 when it arrives in the UK in January . No frills: The basic 'Access' model doesn't even come with a radio or air conditioning, although motorists can upgrade . The car will be in showrooms from  January 2013 with customer deliveries expected to begin later the same month. Selling right hand drive cars in the UK is the ‘final piece of the jigsaw’, the company said. The five door  car will be capable of transporting five people and their luggage, ‘in comfort’, says the firm. The entry level Access model at  £5,995 is far from spartan and includes 15” steel wheels, power assisted steering, a 60/40 split folding rear seat and even daytime running lights. There’s also pre-wiring for an radio and speaker system, which will be available to buy through official Dacia Retailers. Safety features include anti-lock ABS brakes with Emergency Brake Assist, traction control, Electronic Stability Control, driver, passenger and front side airbags and ISOFIX points in both outer rear seats. Available in white, its chunky . five-door bodystyle is complemented well by its contrasting black . bumpers, door mirrors and handles. Dacia says the interior is a ‘clear step forward’  with  cloth ‘Element’ upholstery, combined with a smart, modern interior. It has one of the biggest boots in its class, at 320 litres or a ‘cavernous’ 1,200 litres with the rear seats down. While the new car comes with power-steering, a radio and CD player will cost £110 extra . The budget model will be brought to the UK in January. The company says it is an 'enemy of the unnecessary' The mid-level Ambiance costing £600 more offers a radio CD player with fingertip remote controls, USB and AUX input, Bluetooth, remote central locking, electric front windows, body coloured bumpers and 15” ‘Colorado’ wheel trims. There are also ‘plush interior touches’ such as chrome surrounds for the air vents, instrument dials and steering wheel logo. The top-of-the-range Sandero is called the Lauréate which Dacia expects up to two thirds of buyers to choose and costs from £7,995. It comes ‘fully loaded’ with equipment including air conditioning, heated and electrically adjustable door mirrors, cruise control and electric rear windows as standard. There is also a  height adjustable driver’s seat and steering wheel, leather steering wheel and gear knob and an upgraded radio CD player with MP3 CD reader and fingertip remote controls and four speakers, a trip computer and a speed limiter. The interior is also more ‘upmarket’ with a graphite look finish for the centre console surround, front door handles and steering wheel lower insert. Its modern looks are also made even sharper with 15” ‘Kalahari’ wheel trims, chrome front grille, front fog lights and body-coloured door handles and door mirrors. There’s also an optional fully-integrated 7-inch touchscreen navigation and multimedia system for just £250. Budget: The basic Sandero model costs less than some optional extras on luxury cars, including go-faster stripes on a Ferrari 599 (pictured) 15-inch steel wheels, power assisted steering, a 60/40 split folding rear seat and a 320 litre boot and daytime running lights. Safety wise, you get ABS with Emergency Brake Assist, ASR traction control, Electronic Stability Control, driver, passenger and front side airbags and ISOFIX points for child's car seats in the rear seats. Pre-wiring for a radio (radio not included) To power the car is a choice of  three frugal engines. The 1.2 litre 16V 75 petrol is on offer with every trim level. The even more frugal, yet powerful, petrol TCe 90 and diesel dCi 90 versions are available for both the Ambiance and Lauréate. The four-cylinder 1.2 petrol delivers 47.9 mpg on the combined cycle with CO2 emissions of 137g/km, enough for road tax band E. That means road tax of only £10 per month. It has a top speed of around 98mph and accelerates from rest to 62mph in around 13.5 seconds. The second engine is the 0.9 litre three cylinder TCe 90 with Stop&Start technology capable of 109 mph, with fuel economy of 54.3 mpg and CO2 emissions of just 120 g/km. That adds up to just £30 in road tax every year, with absolutely zero to pay in the first. It will accelerate from rest to 60mph in about 12 seconds. The third is the new 1.5-litre diesel dCi 90 which delivers 74.3 mpg and sub-100 grams of CO2 per kilometre emissions, which makes it exempt from road tax and the London Congestion Charge. It has a top speed of around 106mph with 0–62mph in roughly 12.5 seconds. A top-of-the range Dacia Sandero with the full suite of extras will still only cost a little over £10,000 . Dacia was bought by Renault in 1999 and has gone from 5,000 sales in 2004 to 350,000 last year . The two top engines also boast gearshift indicators and an ‘ECO’ to reduce fuel consumption by 10% and save valuable pennies at the pumps. According to Autoblog,Dacia will introduce a liquid propane gas variant to the mix later this year. Access models are available exclusively in white, with the other two trim levels able to be specified in one of five metallic shades: Cinder Red, Mercury, Pearl Black, Sargasso Blue and Stone. Two packs are also available: The Protection Pack, which costs £395, including an alarm, boot liner and rear parking sensors, and the Touring Pack, which includes a front centre armrest, boot luggage net and transversal roof bars, for £850.

A Dacia spokesman said: 'Dacia manages to make and sell such a temptingly-priced car and still make a profit by making an enemy of the unnecessary. 'Over the last few years, Dacia’s engineering team have worked out how even the simplest idea can lead to a few pennies being saved. 'Right down to using the same windows on every car in the range, it all helps shave even more off prices for the hard-pressed car buyer.’ But they’re not cutting corners, he said: ‘Dacia is renowned for its quality and reliability. 'After all, its models are designed, engineered and built to cope with the rough stuff and weather extremes everywhere from Brazil to Russia.’ In February, the brand ranked number-one on reliability in a survey carried out with30,000 customers by consumer organisations in Belgium, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal. As its parent company is Renault, it also has access to the latest engine powertrains and equipment. It even comes with a 3 years/60,000 miles warranty and free roadside assistance. This can be upgraded to 5 years/60,000 miles and 7 years/100,000 miles for £395 and £850 respectively. The spokesman added: ‘From humble beginnings, the Romanian brand has gone from strength to strength since Renault bought it in 1999 and transformed its fortunes. 'For the last eight years in a row it has been the fastest-growing automotive brand in Europe, rising from under 5,000 sales in 2004 to shifting a mighty 350,000 last year. And the final piece of the jigsaw is the UK.' Leather upholstery is a luxury option costing £600 on the Lauréate. Two other options likely to be popular are metallic paint at £470 and 15-inch ‘Sahara’ alloy wheels for £425, both available for Ambiance and Laureate. The 7-inch MediaNav is available as an option on the flagship Lauréate for just £250 including VAT and features steering column-mounted fingertip controls, an AM/FM/LW radio, satellite navigation, USB and AUX connectivity and Bluetooth, which the car firm says makes it 'arguably the most comprehensive and best value car manufacturer system of its kind on the market.’ Previous budget cars to hit UK shores have included the Renault Twizy at £6,690 and the Suzuki Alto, priced at £7,195.

Bundle of joy: Mother Sonia Banks with baby Phoebe who was born on the train to Maidstone last night . You can just imagine the collective eye-roll when the guard announced the packed 18.18 from London Victoria was going to be delayed. No doubt those eyes stood out on stalks when they heard it was because a woman had gone into labour. Fifteen minutes later, Sonia Banks, 22, had given birth a baby girl on the carriage floor – to the cheers (and perhaps a few tears)of fellow passengers. Miss Banks's waters broke on Thursday afternoon but she was told by hospital staff in Tunbridge Wells to go home because her baby was 'not going to be born for a long time'. To get home to Cuxton in Kent, she boarded the commuter train to Ashford International at Borough Green, with her boyfriend Allan Stanley, 21, and his mother Mari-Anne. But less than five minutes later, as the train approached West Malling, Miss Banks turned to them and said: 'I've just felt a contraction and I'm going into labour.' The family feared the worst because Miss Banks had a traumatic birth when she had her first child four years ago. Luckily, an off-duty midwife, off-duty police officer and a nurse happened to be on board and sprang into action as the train came to a halt. The policeman ushered passengers into another carriage as the midwife, nurse and Mrs Stanley helped Miss Banks on to the floor – while Southeastern train guard Colin Brooker kept the passengers informed of progress. Phoebe Stanley was delivered within 15 minutes, weighing 6lbs 13oz. And remarkably, the train was delayed for just 37 minutes. Mother and daughter were taken to hospital but were released yesterday. Baby Phoebe's hospital band which says where and when she was born . Happy family: Father Allan Stanley spoke of his amazement that his daughter was born on board a train . Miss Banks said: 'I was petrified. One minute I was sitting in the seat talking to my mum on the phone, the . next I started contractions and then it all happened so quickly. 'I just thought ""I don't want to give birth on a train – it's not very dignified"". 'When Phoebe arrived I was shell-shocked. It's still sinking in. She was a week early so we weren't really expecting her. Delight: Grandmother Mari-Anne Stanley, right, told how the couple had been on their way back from hospital when Sonia suddenly went into labour . 'Overwhelmed': Father Allan Stanley described the birth of his daughter on the train as 'surreal' 'Apparently everyone was cheering us . when we were taken off the train to an ambulance but like any new mum . all I could concentrate on was my baby.' Mr Stanley, a chef, said: 'I can't . believe my daughter was born on a train. It still seems so surreal. I . was so worried when we knew the baby was coming. 'But to be there when she was born was just amazing. We're just so grateful to everyone who helped.' Scene: A train pulls into West Malling Railway Station today, where Baby Phoebe was born last night . Drama: Passengers waited here on the train and on the platform as Phoebe came into the world, and clapped and cheered as they were taken to hospital . Florist Mrs Stanley, 40, said: 'I want to say a really big thank you to all the passengers who were so patient. 'None of the passengers in our . carriage complained when they were asked to move to another carriage or . get off the train. They were all so nice and concerned.

We were only missing a vicar to baptise the baby! 'In all my 41 years working on the railway I've never experienced anything like this. It was amazing.' Many passengers took to Twitter to detail their unusual train journey home. One wrote: 'O Lordy. Woman on my . train just gave birth to a daughter. Eventful journey.

A hard-up father-of-three who moved his family into caravans because he could not afford the rent has been jailed - because he refused to move them from the picturesque village in which they lived. Asa Pryke, 47, and his wife Gwen, 48, pitched the campsite after their nursery business went bust forcing them to leave their rented home. But despite the fact that the two-acre plot has been in the Prykes' family for over 300 years, council chiefs told them they would still need planning permission, even to set up camp. The couple and their three teenage children turned to the council for help but say they were only offered a flat that was too small to house a family of five. Jailed: Asa Pryke, 47, and his wife Gwen, 48, moved into tents on their field in the the picturesque village of Dedham, Essex, when their day nursery business went under and they could no longer afford the rent on their home . Desperate and penniless, they say they had no choice but to move onto the only piece of land they owned. There they have been living for the past 18 months in their small collection of tents and caravans. Now, after losing a long and bitter battle to gain the planning permission, Mr Pryke has been handed a four-month jail sentence after refusing to move. The devastated couple are convinced their plans for an eco-friendly £32,000 home on the field in the affluent village - that provided the backdrop for a host of paintings by the eminent British painter John Constable - angered local residents, leaving them with no chance of getting the green light. Their solicitor had tried to argue moving them from the land, in an area of outstanding natural beauty, breached their human rights. On the line: There they have been living for the past 18 months in their small collection of tents and caravans . Tent village: Desperate and penniless, Mr and Mrs Pryke say they had no choice but to move onto the only piece of land they owned - an empty field in the heart of 'Constable Country' Desperate: A county court judge has now jailed Mr Pryke and also warned his wife that she would be put behind bars for four months if the field is not cleared. Mrs Pryke holds up the court letter sentencing her husband, right . Field of dreams: But despite the fact that the land has been in Mrs Pryke's family for over 300 years, Colchester Borough Council say they must still have planning permission, even to camp there . Mrs Pryke’s family has lived in the popular commuting village, since the 1600s and the couple were married at the local church. But a county court judge has now jailed Mr Pryke and also warned his wife that she would be put behind bars for four months if the field is not cleared. The couple were not jailed simultaneously because of their three teenage children. Mrs Pryke, 48, fought back tears after hearing her husband would be starting his jail sentence. She said: 'The judge told me I have got to reflect whilst Asa is in prison because when he is out, they could apply for a warrant and I could be jailed. Home comforts: Now, after losing a long and bitter battle to gain the planning permission Mr Pryke has been handed a four-month jail sentence after refusing to move from the two-acre plot . At home together: Mrs Pryke¿s family has lived in the popular commuting village, since the 1600s and the couple were married at the local church . 'Doers': Mr Pryke said they would rather 'stand on our own feet and live on our land than take taxpayers' money for housing support' 'It was so upsetting - we tried to say ‘how can you do such a thing and why do you think it is right?’ 'The judge just told us he was upholding the law.' Some residents living in the village have welcomed the ruling. One said: asked not to be named 'This is a lovely area to live and people have been upset by the sight of the caravans and tents. 'The law is the law and although it may seem extreme for this gentleman to be jailed, it certainly could have been avoided. 'It’s sad to see what has happened to the family but really, one can only have so much sympathy because they were given a lot of warning of what was going to happen.' Picturesque: The devastated couple are convinced their plans for an eco-friendly home on the field in the affluent village of Dedham, Essex, pictured, angered local residents, leaving them with no chance of getting the go ahead . Esteemed company: Grammar School in Dedham John Constable went to school . The couple have thee children, Nicholas, 17, Rohan, 15 and Jody, 13, . Speaking before the ruling Mr Pryke, who is was working as a specialist insurance broker until his sentence, said: 'We are fighting to stay on our land and fighting for what we believe in. 'This country needs ‘doers’ to get out of the mess it is in, not just people who are happy just to take handouts. 'We would rather stand on our own feet and live on our land than take taxpayers’ money for housing support. 'How can making us homeless make any sense when we will be forced to live off state handouts?' The couple were hoping to get planning permission from Colchester Borough Council for their eco-friendly home. Mr Pryke added: 'We would even be prepared to build one home and then give land away for another for social housing. Local sights: John Constable's 1822 masterpiece View on the Stour near Dedham was painted near the Prykes' field . 'That is how committed we are to this project. 'We moved onto here to live in tents because we were desperate and did not want to be hold up in a council flat. 'Of course the laws mean we are forbidden from developing the land without planning permission but when the weather turned on us last winter and we were offered the loan of caravans, then we jumped at the chance because we did not want to freeze to death in the cold.' The couple said they were only offered 'unsuitable' accommodation from the local council in flats and homes which are too small and they don’t want to be at the mercy of unscrupulous landlords. Earlier this year, the couple were given four-month suspended prison sentences, suspended for a year for failing to comply with an earlier order to leave. It is that sentence against Mr Pryke which has now been activated. Tim Young, Colchester borough councillor in charge of planning, said: 'The council has gone through every route possible to assist and advise the family but it has gone to court.

Kenneth Clarke yesterday admitted that Government plans for secret courts may be defeated as one of the country’s leading legal bodies said they were more suited to ‘repressive regimes and undemocratic societies’. As the House of Lords began to debate the Justice and Security Bill – which would allow civil cases involving national security to be conducted behind closed doors – Mr Clarke made a last-ditch attempt to rally support for the legislation. But he played down the significance of Parliamentary defeats, suggesting the Government may have to water down its plans still further to get them into law. Mounting criticism: Kenneth Clarke is trying to drum up support for his unpopular and controversial Justice and Security Bill . In a significant blow to the Bill, the Law Society yesterday warned it would badly damage Britain’s reputation for open and fair justice. The Daily Mail has led criticism of Government plans to allow so-called ‘closed material procedures’, in which cases are conducted entirely in private, in any civil hearing. Defendants or claimants will not be allowed to be present, know or challenge the case against them and must be represented by a security-cleared special advocate, rather than their own lawyer. Currently, such procedures are used in tiny numbers of immigration and deportation hearings, but the Government wants to extend them across the civil courts in cases deemed to involve national security. Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, president of the Law Society, the professional body for solicitors, said: ‘Secret trials and non-disclosure of evidence are potential characteristics of repressive regimes and undemocratic societies. ‘Whilst the Government rightly takes a strong stance in respect of the importance of the rule of law globally, we fear that if passed, this Bill will adversely affect the UK’s international reputation for fair justice. ‘It is our belief that closed material procedures depart from an essential principle of natural justice which is that all parties are entitled to see and challenge all of the evidence relied upon before the court, and to combat that evidence by calling evidence of their own. Lead role: Former Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke is not minister without portfolio but remains in charge of Justice and Security Bill . ‘In addition, CMPs also undermine the principle that public justice should be dispensed in public and will weaken fair trial guarantees. ‘It will be impossible for lawyers to advise their clients in their best interests if they are not privy to the information being used against them in court and are able to discuss this with those clients,’ she said. ‘We believe this breaches a fundamental right of defendants in a just society.’ Crossbench peer Lord Pannick, a leading lawyer, insisted that the current proposals were ‘unfair, unnecessary and unbalanced’. He said judges were already ‘very experienced’ in ensuring that justice and security are satisfied, taking steps such as ordering security witnesses to give evidence from behind a screen, or editing documents to conceal the names of informants, for example. He also insisted it must be left to the judge to decide whether a secret hearing would be necessary. Lord Pannick said the existing law of public interest immunity already ensured any evidence with national security implications was concealed from open court. Former Justice Secretary Mr Clarke, who is now a minister without portfolio but remains in charge of the legislation, insisted it was necessary because terror suspects are launching a ‘steady stream’ of compensation claims against the security services. He said the law ‘simply cannot deal with what we’ve suddenly started acquiring – these cases where people bring claims against MI5, MI6, usually saying they’re complicit in some ill treatment they’ve suffered … and the only evidence that can be used to defend it is evidence from agents who are revealing their sources, or saying what they know about organisations. ‘And everybody agrees that can’t possibly be given in open.’ But suggesting the Government believes it may lose key votes in the Lords tomorrow, forcing them to amend the legislation, Mr Clarke added: ‘Any defeat is actually a debate between lawyers.’","Justice and Security Bill would allow civil cases involving national security to be conducted behind closed doors .

It's one of those everyday irritations that most people are too polite to do anything about. So imagine the relief of the passengers on one train journey when someone else told off a woman for having a rather loud mobile phone conversation. To the added glee of commuters, their hero was the train driver. The train was travelling from London Euston (file picture) to Milton Keynes when the announcement was made to the delight of passengers . Mid-way through the journey from London Euston to Milton Keynes, the driver announced on the tannoy: ‘This is a special message to the lady travelling in first class in the middle of the train.

Prison officers went on a takeaway run to 'avoid upsetting' inmates unhappy with what was on offer in the canteen. Three prisoners at HMP Rye Hill in Warwickshire protested when caterers ran out of fried chicken, leaving only chicken Kiev available. One inmate is said to have threatened to harm himself until officers travelled three miles to a chip shop to pick up a £4.75 chicken and chip meal for all three of the prisoners. Takeaway run: Staff at HMP Rye Hill in Warwickshire fetched takeaway fried chicken for three inmates last week . The duty director at Rye Hill, a Category B facility in Willoughby, near Rugby, approved the trip last week after deciding it was the best way to 'avoid upsetting' the prisoners, according to a report in the Sun. 'It was disgusting they were so pampered,' a relative of another Rye Hill prisoner told the newspaper, adding that other staff on duty had been unhappy with the 'special treatment'. Security firm G4S, which runs the prison, has confirmed the incident did take place, but said taxpayers would not be covering the £14.25 cost of the takeaway. 'Due to Wednesday’s evening meal service being a little short, a decision was taken to source from a local outlet,' a G4S spokesman said. 'This isn’t what should have happened and steps are being taken to ensure this doesn’t happen again.' 'Special treatment': The inmates are said to have been unhappy with the food on offer in the canteen at the jail .

Serial thief Annette Daniel, 51, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after admitting stealing designer handbags and clothes . A notorious serial thief dubbed the 'Queen of Shoplifting' has been jailed for stealing more than £35,000 worth of luxury goods from Harrods. Annette Daniel, 51, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after admitting stealing designer handbags and clothes from the world famous London store in May and November last year. Sentencing Daniel, who has 22 . previous convictions dating back to 1982, Judge Simon Oliver highlighted . her previous stealing sprees across the UK, adding: 'At least you get . to see the world if nothing else by your offending.' He continued: 'Annette Daniel, . because of the extent of your thieving in the two offences that you have . pleaded guilty to and bearing in mind your previous convictions you . will go to prison for 18 months.' The Glaswegian thief seemed far from concerned by the prison sentence. She laughed and winked from the dock - even joking about the £100 victim surcharge imposed on her as the custody officer led her away to the cells, saying: 'How can we pay that if we're in prison?' Isleworth Crown Court heard how Daniel and four friends attempted to steal almost £24,000 of designer handbags on a single shoplifting spree in November. Daniel was captured on CCTV pointing to expensive goods, before her accomplice James Shearer, 38, loaded them into an M&S bag. Roxanna Nasser, prosecuting, said: 'Annette Daniel was seen pointing to items which were then picked up by Mr Shearer and put into M&S bags.' The gang of thieves successfully made it through one set of security barriers at the Knightsbridge store. However, they were caught by the store's security guards soon after and Shearer assaulted a member of staff. Shoplifting sprees: The group twice targeted Harrods in London, pictured, to steal designer dresses and handbags worth more than £35,000 . A search of the car the group travelled down from Scotland in revealed a further £1,195 of clothes they'd already stolen from clothes store Zara. During an earlier shoplifting spree last May, Daniel, Donnelly and Tomlin stole a £5,000 Roberto Cavalli jacket and a £6,000 Ralph Lauren dress. Mrs Nasser told the court: 'CCTV appears to show that these items are taken and stored in bags while they all walk out of the shop.' The three women admitted two counts of conspiracy to steal. James Shearer was jailed for two years for his part in the Harrods theft last November and for assaulting a security guard and kicking a cell door after he was caught. Jean Donnelly, 46, and Shearer's brother Thomas, 33, acted as lookouts on that occasion, while another woman, Julieanne Tomlin, 34, was also involved in the theft. All three women and Thomas Shearer admitted two counts of conspiracy to steal. Thomas Shearer and Tomlin were jailed for 15 months each, while Donnell told the judge: 'Thank you your honour,' as she was sentenced to 18 months. Jailing the five, Judge Simon Oliver said: 'On November 29th last year you stole goods to the value of £25,133. 'You came down from Glasgow to take those goods from Harrods and Zara. 'That was not the only time the three women came to London. On May 14 last year you were in Harrods again, this time taking a jacket and dress to the value of £11,345.' He continued: 'These offences involved prior planning. You were working as a group, you were taking goods of high value and there would have been a high level of gain.","Annette Daniel, 51, has 22 .

Home invasion: Louis Steyn (pictured) was tied up, tortured and robbed by a gang after they burst into his property and threw a house party while he was watching TV . A terrified homeowner was tied up, tortured and robbed by a vicious gang after they burst into his home and threw an impromptu house party. Louis Steyn, 42, was watching TV when three men and two women including a former trainee teacher invaded his property poured themselves drinks and pumped up the volume on a music channel - shouting: 'The party's here!' When Mr Steyn protested, they gagged him, tied his hands and feet together before beating him up and subjecting him to 'gratuitous degradation.' The victim feared for his life during his horrific ordeal and pleaded with one of his tormentors not to stab him as a six-inch boning knife was held threateningly in front of his face. Eventually, the gang ransacked Mr Steyn's home in quiet cul-de-sac in Burnley, Lancs, grabbing laptops, computers and televisions before stuffing them into his Audi A4 and driving off into the night. Mr Steyn managed to get to his feet and call the police and an officer found him with his hands still tied. He was treated in hospital, where he had nine stitches to eye injuries. He also had other cuts to his face, a swollen lip and bruises and marks to his wrists and legs. Details of his ordeal emerged as the gang were jailed for over 27 years after admitting robbery. David Steer, 26, of no fixed abode and John Williams, 20, of Burnley were each jailed for seven years four months. Zac Ward, 25, of Radcliffe, Manchester was jailed for seven years. Mother of one Sally Brennand, 19, of no fixed abode who once had a place on a teaching apprenticeship was jailed for three years four months and Rebecca Greenough, 18, of Burnley was jailed for two years ten months. Steer also admitted aggravated vehicle taking. Burnley Crown Court was told Mr Steyn's ordeal began at 7.30pm on October 25 last year when Williams knocked on his door, asking if he could 'come in for a drink.' Gangland girls: Rebecca Greenough (left), 18, was jailed for two years, ten months and 19-year-old mother Sally Brennand (right) for three years, four months for their part in the robbery . The victim answered the door and told him to go but Steer then appeared and both barged their way inside accompanied by their three accomplices. 'All five defendants made themselves comfortable in the lounge,' said Miss Amanda Johnson, prosecuting. 'One produced a bottle of alcohol, drinks were poured, the TV was turned on to a music channel and the volume was turned up. 'Mr Steyn repeatedly asked the group to leave, but to no avail.' Williams went into the kitchen, got some vodka from the fridge and all five carried on drinking. At about 8.30pm, Williams and Ward went into the kitchen and were heard whispering and seen to put their coats on. Mr Steyn thought they were leaving but instead Steer suddenly punched him in the face, knocking him to the floor and hitting and kicking him. Behind bars: John Williams (left) and Zak Ward (right) were jailed for seven years and seven years, four months after admitting robbery . Miss Johnson said: 'The victim was covering his face and head with his arms and was unable to make out what was being said. Steer began to demand Mr Steyn's car keys and the victim said they were upstairs. 'Williams and Steer then dragged Mr Steyn upstairs, the keys couldn't be find and he was dragged back downstairs again. One defendant found the keys and Mr Steyn was ordered to kneel down and put his hands behind his head, which he did. 'One of the women started putting his DVDs in a bin bag. Williams then appeared in front of the victim, holding a six inch boning knife in front of his face in a threatening manner. 'Mr Steyn was terrified and pleading ""Please don't stab me, take what you want."" Others were ransacking the house and gathering up computer equipment, monitors, DVDs and other electrical items, which were being loaded into the Audi. Sent down: David Steer, 26, of no fixed abode was also jailed for seven years, four mionths . 'Brennand had armed herself with a vegetable knife and was standing in the doorway. 'Steer tried to start the car, but failed. He ordered Mr Steyn to put his hands out and then tied them together with computer cable. 'The victim was then directed to lie down on the floor and his feet were tied together with more cabling. Ward punched Mr Steyn in the eye, causing it to bleed. 'The victim was begging the defendants to stop, saying he would show them how to start his car. Ward got a large carving knife. 'Steer, still unable to start the vehicle, came back into the living room and threats were made to stab the victim. 'Mr Steyn tried to convince the gang he could start the vehicle and they got him to his feet. As he shuffled to the front door, a cloth was fastened around his mouth and tied round his head. Miss Johnson said Mr Steyn's legs were cut free, he was dragged to the car and it was started. Ward dragged the victim back into the house and pushed him into the kitchen, shouting : ' I will deal with this.' Ward told Mr Steyn: 'I'm not back to jail again' then whilst still holding the knife, started wrapping a cloth around his hand. Miss Johnson continued : 'Mr Steyn feared for his life, thinking he was going to be stabbed by Zak Ward.' Ward told the victim : ' Give it 10 minutes. I will call the police. I'm sorry. I never wanted anything anything to do with this. Tell the police I didn't steal anything.' The gang then left but the Audi A4 was seen in Blackpool just before midnight after being driven by Streer through a red traffic light at 80mph. Police stopped it with a stinger device and found Steer was almost twice the drink drive limit. In a statement Mr Steyn said since the offence his life had completely changed. He was afraid at home, his sleep had been disturbed, he felt stressed and he had been left scarred. Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder William Smith said: 'The whole incident was a terrifying one for the victim. He was fortunate to have suffered relatively modest physical injuries, but he has, no doubt, the psychological scars that remain with him.' After the case Det Con John Dodrill from Lancashire Police said: 'This incident had a devastating effect on the victim. Robbery is a very personal crime and the man has been left feeling terrified and violated in his own home. 'I hope the sentences will be seen as a stark deterrent to others. Tackling robbery is a key priority for the police and we will continue to do everything we can to target those involved and bring them to justice.'","Louis Steyn watching TV when three men and two women stormed in .

A couple who routinely drugged their toddler daughter so they could 'catch up on their sleep' have been given suspended prison sentences. The drug addict mother, 41, and father, 40, regularly gave their two-year-old daughter the liquid paracetamol Medised - intended for children more than twice her age - for a year and a half so she was less likely to wake in the night and disturb their sleep, a court heard. Gloucester Crown Court was told the little girl also sometimes had the sedative Diazepam - used to treat severe anxiety and agitation. The parents admitted cruelty after drugging their toddler with Medised so they could catch up on their sleep . The girl had to be fed through a . nasal tube when she was born due to problems caused by her mother's use . of Diazepam and the heroin substitute methadone while she was pregnant, . the court heard. Instead . of weaning their daughter off the tube, the couple, from Nailsworth in . Gloucestershire, continued to use it routinely because it was easier for . them, prosecutor Kannan Siva said. They . went on to give her Medised on a nightly basis between the ages of two . and a three and a half so they could sleep, he added. The . little girl was taken into the care of an aunt in June 2011 after her . 'plainly selfish' parents, who met in rehab, told a social worker what . they had been doing. Judge . Jamie Tabor QC criticised the couple for their 'remarkably stupid' actions, and told them he would have jailed them were it not for the . fact it would deprive their daughter of weekly supervised visits from . her parents. The parents, whose identities cannot be revealed, walked free from court after being handed suspended sentences . Their offences were not malicious but . they were quite plainly selfish to spare themselves the tribulations of . parenthood, the judge said. 'Every . parent of a young child will have undergone sleepless nights because the . child is unsettled for one reason or another. You chose to adminster . Medised, which was not intended for a child that age, and you chose to . keep very quiet about it,' he said. 'I . see before me a wholly inadequate man who was rather struggling with . this child and a mother who was more concerned with herself than her . child,' the judge added. Both parents admitted being cruel to . their daughter between September 2009 and June 2011 by routinely . administering Medised - a liquid medicine typically prescribed to . children between the ages of six and 12 to relieve cold and flu . symptoms, fevers or headaches. Her mother admitted a similar charge . involving her daughter taking Diazepam, but denied that she had given it . to her daughter deliberately. 'Plainly selfish': The mother, 41, and father, 40, were given suspended sentences at Gloucester Crown Court . The couple's denial of a charge of administering methadone to their daughter was accepted by the prosecution. They had faced another charge of cruelty by using a feeding tube on the child, which was not proceeded with. Judge Jamie Tabor QC . The . woman was sentenced to 18 months suspended for a period of two years, . while the man was given a 12 month sentence suspended for the same . period. Both were placed under a curfew between the hours of 8pm and 6am for a period of six months. The . court heard the couple's daughter was eating normally within a month of . being taken into care and had grown into a 'bright little button'. Her parents have supervised access to their daughter at weekends. It might send the little girl 'off the rails' if she were to be deprived of the visits, the judge said. Her . aunt said in a recent statement: 'She is a much loved, beautiful and . bright little girl, surrounded by the people who love her deeply, . especially her mum and dad.' Giles Nelson, representing the girl's mother, said the couple met when they were both in rehab in 2001. 'I am afraid they went badly wrong as parents,' he said. Martin Steen, representing her father, said: 'He thought that by giving Medised he was relieving her [his daughter] and relieving himself. He now recognises he was wrong and is ashamed. He loves his daughter dearly.' Judge Tabor told the couple that with their own drug addiction histories they should have known better and what they had done was 'most remarkably stupid'. He said the mother had show no real effort to address her own addictions and was still taking the highest prescription of methadone he had ever seen.","Little girl was routinely given Medised at night from the age of two .

Gender divide: TV presenter Prof Alice Roberts argues pink Lego reinforces sexists attitudes which see boys perform better at science . Pink Lego for girls helps reinforce gender attitudes that see boys performing better in science, a BBC television presenter and scientist has claimed. Professor Alice Roberts, the popular presenter on the 'Coast' series and 'Prehistoric Autopsy', hit out at the sexism that deters women from pursuing the subject. Since girls are better represented in maths and science in most other countries around the world, the reason why they lag behind in Britain must be 'something cultural' rather than 'an innate biological thing', she told an education conference. She said: 'The gender divide seems to be getting worse to me. 'Lego has always been a good toy which teaches children about engineering. But Lego is now producing a range which it is says is for girls, which is completely pink and is about creating cakes. 'I think the problem is happening at a very young age, when the idea is instilled that there is a big difference between girls and boys, rather than at age 15.' She added: 'What I found outrageous was the suggestion that using shopping and pink to get girls interested in science would work. It goes back to a 1950s idea of what women should be like. 'The key is to make these subjects less gender specific than more so.' She was speaking in front of teachers and school leaders at the Education Innovation event in Manchester. Criticism: Professor Roberts has attacked Lego for making product ranges which are targeted at girls . She pointed to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development which showed Britain was one of only three countries where teenage girls did worse than boys in maths and science. The married TV scientist, who is a Professor at Birmingham University and has a young daughter, said: 'It is definitely difficult for women to progress in scientific careers. ''One of the problems is childcare. If you have a career break, it has an amazingly bad effect on people's career. 'If you look at the men and women starting science degrees at university the numbers are about equal, but when you get to professor level, only 15 per cent are women.'' Popular: The television scientist is best known as a presenter on Coast and Prehistoric Autopsy . Prof Roberts, 39, added: 'The fact that girls are doing better in other parts of the world, suggest it is not an innate biological thing. There must be something cultural going on.' Prof Roberts is set to appear on screens later this year in the BBC documentary Ice Age. Lego said its 'Friends' range was developed following requests from parents and girls for more realistic and detailed sets with brighter colours and role-playing opportunities. A spokesman said: 'We've always had Lego bricks that are pink and we've got a wide variety of different sets. 'We don't say “this is for girls”. It's up to the child or the parent to make the choice.'

The thieving couple snatched presents and . jewellery valued at over £15,000. Hall, who had no previous convictions, embarked on their first burglary just a month after giving birth to a boy, the couple's first child. Guilty: James Parker, 24,  (left) recruited his girlfriend, Charlotte Hall, 21, (right) to act as a getaway driver in a Christmas burglary campaign . But she was spared jail after a judge described her as a 'stupid girl' who was blinded by love and fell for a criminal. Sentencing Hall to a 12-month suspended prison term, Judge Sean Morris admitted: 'Gracious knows what the householders will think when they hear about the sentence. Who knows they might be right.' Jailing Parker for two years and four months, Judge Morris told him it was an aggravating factor that he had recruited his partner and the mother of their newborn child. Lincoln Crown Court heard the couple were responsible for nearly 30 burglaries and attempted break-ins carried out over the Christmas period in 2012. Among the items stolen by the pair were a 100-year-old family bracelet and a set of £1,200 pearls bought as a Christmas present. Other property taken by the couple, who even raided one house on Boxing Day, included a lap-top computer containing sensitive personal information and a watch given to a victim by his mother.

The court was told Hall drove Parker 15 miles in her Fiat Punto car to Lincoln where most of the burglaries occurred while the owners were out. Much of the stolen property was recovered when police raided the couple's home in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, two days after Christmas. In total police estimated the couple made over £15,000 from their criminal activity. Their victims included an elderly couple in poor health who were away visiting relatives for Christmas and a woman who now felt unsafe in her home of over four decades. The court heard Parker had a string of previous convictions for dishonesty and was jailed for four years in 2009. 'Gracious knows what the householders will think when they hear about the sentence. Who knows they might be right.' Judge Sean Morris . Sunil Khanna, mitigating for Hall, said she was just 20-years-old when she met Parker. 'She chose to ignore things that were said about him,' Mr Khanna told the court. 'She got pregnant, they got a property together but unfortunately he was made redundant from his job cleaning farm machinery on October 24. Their son was born on October 31.' Hall tried to resist when Parker turned back to crime, Mr Khanna added. 'In her words he wore her down and he persuaded her if she remained in the car and did not go in to the property or on to the land then she had done nothing wrong. She accepts she was naive.' Following her arrest Hall co-operated fully with police. In total she admitted five charges of burglary in December last year and asked for 21 other offences to be taken in to consideration. Parker pleaded guilty to the same five break-ins and asked for a further 23 offences to be taken in to consideration. Mark Watson, mitigating for Parker, said he accepted being the 'driving force' behind the break-ins. Sentencing Hall to 12 months behind bars suspended for 18 months, Judge Morris told her: 'You richly deserve to go to prison. If there is one thing a burglar needs it is somebody to drive him and look perfectly innocent. That is you.' But Judge Morris added: 'It is clear to me you are a stupid girl who fell for a man who got you into crime. I don't mean to be impolite, love blinds may be a better way of putting it.' Hall was also made the subject of a six month nightly curfew and placed under the supervision of a probation officer for 18 months. Jailing Parker for 28 months, Judge Morris added: 'This was a campaign of burglary during the Christmas period when there was rich pickings to be had in peoples' homes. It was the season of goodwill to all, you broke some hearts.' Speaking after the hearing DC Glen Wright, from Lincolnshire Police, said: 'As the judge said this was a campaign of burglary over the Christmas period. I think he was right in that Parker was the driving force as Hall was a young lady with no previous convictions.' One of the burglary victims said: 'As a result of these two I now feel vulnerable in the home I have lived in for 40 years.'","James Parker, 24, recruited Charlotte Hall, 21, as getaway driver .

Singer Justin Bieber had to halt his show at London's O2 on Thursday night after collapsing and 'experiencing breathing difficulties' on stage. The Baby hitmaker, who has had a controversial run at the concert venue this week, reportedly had to rush off stage and was looked at by doctors... but 15 minutes later he was back finishing the show in front of his fans. And his manager Scooter Braun revealed while Bieber was missing from the stage that doctors had asked him to get looked at properly, but he insisted on coming out to finish the set regardless, before then heading to a hospital. Scroll down for video... In hospital: Justin Bieber collapsed on stage on Thursday night after 'experiencing breathing difficulties' and was taken to hospital - after firstly completing his set . Feeling better: After being taken to hospital following the gig, Justin tweeted his fans to thank them for their support . In a move that some fans are cynically suggesting could have been a PR move for the star, Scooter told the audience: 'Justin got quite light of breath. The whole show he's been complaining, he's backstage with the doctor. 'They're telling him that they want him to go see somebody and see what's going on with his lungs. '(But) He has just told me that if it's okay with you guys he's going to come out and finish the show. Alright?' Party boy: Justin looked unable to stand as he bent over during the concert to catch his breathe . 'Creepy': Bieber posted this picture of the hospital corridor after finishing the show to be checked out by doctors . Trooper: Justin Bieber reportedly nearly collapsed on stage on Thursday after experiencing breathing problems - but 15 minutes later came on to finish the set for his fans . Gamer: Justin Bieber was apparently two hours late to his show on Monday because he was playing video games and woke up late . And in a nod to the controversy surrounding Bieber from earlier this week when he angered parents and fans by showing up late for his debut gig, Scooter added: 'So he might not be jumping around as much but if you guys could be patient with us. We're not trying to be disrespectful, we're not trying to get you guys home late. We're truly trying to put on a show for these beautiful people of London. 'Just bear with us - he's going to come out very soon and we'll do the best we can to finish the show.' Following the concert Bieber was reportedly taken to hospital to get checked and was listening to Janis Joplin while lying on a bed before leaving in high spirits. Shortly after 1am he wrote to his fans on Twitter: 'Getting better. thanks for everyone pulling me thru tonight. best fans in the world. figuring out what happened. thanks for the love.' Diva: A source close to the star told Heat magazine that the Canadian threw a tantrum before the Monday night show at the O2 . He then posted a picture of himself from his hospital bed in recovery, as well as a picture of the hospital corridor he labelled 'creepy'. Bieber was two hours late for his debut show at the O2 on Monday after reportedly 'throwing a massive tantrum', ranting at worried staff: 'It's my gig, I will go out when I want to' - it has been claimed. According to backstage sources Justin, 19, was in a foul mood after waking up late because of a night out and the 'stroppy youngster locked himself in his dressing room to play computer games'. Despite being accused of coming onstage two hours after he was billed to, with hundreds of upset teenagers leaving before getting the chance to see their idol, Justin said he was only 40 minutes late on Monday - blaming technical difficulties and saying the gig was 'great'. Tardy: Despite fans complaining, Bieber still maintains he was only 40 minutes late to stage . One O2 worker, who did not want to be named, told The Sun: 'He was arguing with members of his management, his family. It was a really uncomfortable atmosphere. His attitude was, ""I’m the star and I can do what I want""'. Another worker, Ellie Grace, said: 'I hope I never have to experience so many upset children and disappointed fans again.' Speaking to Heat magazine, an insider said the 19-year old refused to go onstage before showering, despite desperate pleas from his management to perform. Curious: Wearing two expensive watches it's a wonder how Justin couldn't see he was late to his own concert . Another backstage source added: 'His . lateness was because he didn’t get out of bed until late and sat in his . dressing room playing games - even though his door was being knocked.' 'He then threw a strop as he said he wanted a shower first, despite already being late.' It is thought Justin arrived at the O2 arena at 3pm 'to do some meet and greets' but he . was suffering after a ' heavy night at his hotel. But the great audience at the O2 weren't the only ones to be disappointed. A . 15-year old fan - who did not want to be named for fear of backlash . from the Belieber community - was 'blanked' by her musical hero even . though she had won a competition to meet him before the show. The unhappy girl told Heat that she and her friends, waited for three hours to see Justin. However, when their idol finally arrived, they say he spent 'less than ten seconds' with him. She also claims the singer declined to give her a hug, ironically telling his fan 'I don't have time.' A source close to Justin said: 'There was no competition winner that we knew or approved of.' 'If it was a radio contest winner who got a meet and greet, they got the same amount of time as everyone else and exactly what was promised.' The rest of the accounts are 'wildly exaggerated or just untrue.' Even an O2 staff member witnessed . Justin's alleged diva-like behaviour: . 'He was arguing with members of . his management, his family. It was a really uncomfortable atmosphere. His attitude was, ""I’m the star and I can do what I want"".' Despite . a wealth of attendees confirming his two hour delay to stage, the . Canadian star still maintains he only kept his fans waiting for 40 . minutes. Party doesn't stop! After his show, Justin heads out for another 'good time' in London . 'Last night i was scheduled after 3 opening acts to go on stage at 935 . not 830 but because of some technical issues i got on at 10:10..so...(sic)' the singer tweeted. Digital Spy also reported that the star is being asked to pay a £300,000 fine to Greenwich Council for causing the gig to run past the 11pm closing time. However, a Royal Borough of Greenwich spokesperson said: '[We] have not taken any action against the owners of The O2 in relation to Justin Bieber’s recent performance, as no breach of our licensing conditions took place.' 'I never have any intent to upset or let anyone down. and Im not okay . with things being exaggerated. once again sorry for anyone upset.(sic)' But to ensure the backlash didn't . continue, the following night's performance saw Justin arrive on stage . two minutes early, according to his official Twitter page.","Bieber disappeared from stage for 15 minutes after collapsing and experiencing 'breathing difficulties'

A woman suffering such severe arthritis that her elbows fused at 90 degrees has married after having life-changing surgery. Alice Swallow, 24, has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis since the age of ten. Her condition was so severe that she was unable to bend her arms until she had surgery last year. Doctors performed two elbow replacement operations - giving her the ability to fold her arms again. Brave: Alice Swallow has suffered from crippling rheumatoid arthritis for 14 years. On Saturday she married fiance Ryan . Close: Until she had surgery last year, Alice couldn't even hold Ryan's hand, as her elbows were fused at 90 degrees . Until then, the agonising condition meant she had never held her fiance Ryan's hand. And on Saturday, the couple tied the knot surrounded by their family and friends near Kelvedon, Essex. Alice, of Ipswich, Suffolk, met Ryan, 26, in 2009. Before she underwent surgery, she relied heavily on Ryan to help her with everyday tasks such as pouring drinks, getting dressed and washing her hair. Alice had her elbow replacement surgery . at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in London. The operation is . relatively rare and only carried out between 500 and 1,000 times a year . in the UK. Operation: Alice is thought to be one of the youngest people in Britain to undergo the life-changing elbow surgery . Life changing: Before the surgery, Alice relied heavily on Ryan to help her with everyday tasks such as pouring drinks, getting dressed and washing her hair . Alice is one of the youngest people in Britain to have undergone the tough procedure. She believes that had she not had the life-changing surgery, she would never have married. She said: 'I lost a lot of self-confidence and I wouldn't even try a wedding dress on until I had recovered. 'The movement I have regained in my arms [since having surgery] is just amazing. 'I would never have walked down the aisle if I couldn't do the things I can now.' Celebrating: Alice believes she would never have married had she not undergone the radical surgery . Hopeful: 'We have so much to look forward to and there is now nothing really holding us back,' said Alice .

'Terrible tragedy': Declan Newsome's skull was fractured when he came off his bike after clipping a car as he sped down the hill . A paperboy who died after falling from a faulty bike and fracturing his skull had been 'pedalling like billy-o' down a steep hill when he clipped a car and hit the pavement. Declan Newsome, 15, who didn't see the car stopping ahead of him until the last moment, tried to avoid the vehicle but the brakes on his bike were 'totally ineffective', an inquest heard. The teenager, a prefect at his school in Bradford, West Yorkshire, was not wearing a helmet. The schoolboy lost control when he tried to swerve around the car, which had stopped in front of him to allow another vehicle to pass in the opposite direction on the narrow road. He clipped the rear light on the Suzuki Wagon R on Hopton Lane in Mirfield, then hit another car before coming off his bike and hitting his head on the road. He was airlifted to hospital with a fractured skull and a severe brain injury following the accident on the morning of July 9 last year. He died three weeks later at Leeds General Infirmary when his life support machine was switched off. Coroner Roger Whittaker, who recorded a verdict of accidental death, described Declan's death as a terrible tragedy and said no-one was to blame. The Castle Hall Academy pupil's devastated parents Kenneth and Harriet Newsome have called for speed cameras or speed bumps to be installed along Hopton Lane. Mr Newsome, 69, said after the hearing: 'I hope the powers that be see the trauma that we have been through and get something done. 'Our son was safety conscious and looked after his bike but he lost his life, his career, his future. I want Declan never to be forgotten and something positive to come from his death,' Mr Newsome added. Scene: The teenager lost control of his bike when a car stopped in front of him to let another vehicle pass . The driver of the Suzuki, builder Donald MacMillan, of Holmfirth, said he had to stop behind a parked car on Hopton Lane to allow other vehicles to come up the hill. He told the inquest the schoolboy was 'pedalling like billy-o' with his head down. Mr MacMillan, who was stationary with his handbrake on, said: 'I could see him coming from behind and as he got close he lifted his head and saw me there. He was only 6ft or 7ft away. 'I could see him brake and the handlebars shaking,' he said. Declan clipped the back of the Suzuki with his handlebar and hit the side of a Volkswagen Golf coming up the hill. Driver Susan Ferguson, from Dewsbury, said she had been travelling at around 10mph when the cyclist suddenly appeared from behind the Suzuki. Steve Green, West Yorkshire Police's principal collision investigator, said the brakes on Declan's bike were 'grossly maladjusted' and 'totally ineffective'. He said the rear brake did not work at all and the front only partially. The bike had a 'V-brake' system which Mr Green said was 'notoriously difficult because it needs to be set up correctly'. He added: 'We will never know if Declan applied the brakes but if he did he could not have stopped.' Consultant pathologist Dr Julian Ostrowski, who carried out the post-mortem, said that even if the schoolboy had been wearing a helmet it would not have prevented the injury. During the hearing the boy's father called upon the coroner to recommend that speed restrictions be introduced in Hopton Lane, but Mr Whittaker said there was no evidence to show that speed was a factor in the incident. 'There is no evidence so, sadly, there's nothing I can do,' he said. Mirfield Conservative councillor Vivien Lees-Hamilton is spearheading a campaign for safety improvements in Hopton Lane in the wake of the accident. She is also helping the family to organise a campaign to make newsagents aware of their safety responsibilities to paperboys and girls.","Brakes on Declan Newsome's bike were 'totally ineffective', inquest heard .

Police have now confirmed that the gun Donald Holland used to kill himself on June 1 belonged to his niece, the missing Alabama teen Brittney Wood who was last seen with her uncle. Ms Wood disappeared on May 30 after she was seen heading to Baldwin County by the Styx River area in her uncle's car. The mystery surrounding her disappearance has been overshadowed, family members say, by the arrest of several of her family members for sex abuse charges, including her brother, Derek Wood, 21. Scroll down for video . Disturbing case: Donald Holland, right, used his niece's gun to kill himself on June 1, just two days after  Alabama teen Brittney Wood, left, went missing. She is pictured with her two-year-old daughter . Weapon: Officials said he used Ms Wood's Raven .25-caliber handgun revolver . Holland shot himself just half an hour before he was scheduled to meet with investigators about the teen's disappearance. Officials said he used Ms Wood's Raven .25-caliber handgun revolver. 'It just really does not look good that she went missing May 30 and two days later he commits suicide,' Ms Wood's mother, Chessie Wood said to Fox. The family told Fox that normally, Ms Wood kept just two bullets in her weapon. Police confirmed that after Holland fired, there was just one left. 'I mean, I just want an answer. That’s all I want. I want to bring her home whether it be tragically or a happy ending,' Mrs Wood said. Relatives are hoping that a $1,500 reward will help them find closure to the case. 'We believe we have missed something that is hollering our name, and maybe it was so obvious,' said Mrs Wood. Missing mom: Brittney Wood, pictured with her two-year-old daughter just weeks before she vanished, has not been seen since she left her Alabama home to visit her uncle . At first, some relatives thought Brittney may have skipped town. 'We as a family do not see how she . had the means to run. We’ve covered every friend, every one of them are . accounted for,' Mrs Woods said. 'I mean if she had to run because she's that scared, I would really believe that she would have [taken] her daughter with her.' 'It just really does not look good that she went missing May 30 and two days later he commits suicide.' Chessie Wood . Brittney’ mother, Chessie Wood, told WKRG that Derek and Brittney were extremely close. She told the network: 'They have the same friends, run the same places, I mean they're like this. He is Brittney's protector and he feels like he wasn't there when he should've been.' Derek Wood, 21, was charged with abuse after her disappearance, according to the Baldwin County Sheriff's Office. In a statement posted on The Hometown Search for Brittney Wood Facebook page her father and stepmother, Wallace & Stephanie Hanke said: 'In the wake of the recent arrest our focus is still the same as it's been from the beginning (sic). 'Our goal is to bring Brittney home. Thanks for the continued support of family & friends.' Family ties: Derek Wood, left, has been charged with several counts of abuse, nearly two months after his younger sister Brittney disappeared . Derek Wood, who is listed on the office’s website as homeless, is being held on $25,000 bond. Also in the weeks since Ms Wood vanished, two more of her uncles were arrested, but the arrests are not believed to be connected to the teen's case.

The Queen will sign a new charter today backing equal rights for women and gay people in every Commonwealth nation in her first official public appearance since leaving hospital. In a special ceremony to mark Commonwealth Day, she will endorse the document which includes the core values - from human rights to the rule of law - that leaders have committed to upholding. The Commonwealth Charter declares: 'We are implacably opposed to all forms of discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political belief or other grounds.' The words 'other grounds' are being seen as including sexuality. Pinning down core values: Queen Elizabeth II delivers her Commonwealth Day pre-recorded message at Buckingham Palace . However there was criticism from some human rights campaigners who said the charter appeared not to include any specific commitment to equality for gay people. The Queen is expected to sign the agreement at London's Marlborough House, the Pall Mall headquarters of the Commonwealth Secretariat. In a pre-recorded speech to be broadcast today, the monarch will say the values of the new charter have 'special emphasis' on including everyone in striving for a better future. She will say: 'Ambition and curiosity open new avenues of opportunity. 'That is what lies at the heart of our Commonwealth approach: individuals and communities finding ways to strive together to create a better future that is beneficial for all.' The Commonwealth Day ceremony will be the Queen's first public appearance since leaving the King Edward VII hospital last week . She will add: 'Our shared values of peace, democracy, development, justice and human rights - which are found in our new Commonwealth Charter - mean that we place special emphasis on including everyone in this goal, especially those who are vulnerable. Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said the charter was 'a step forward' but claimed much more needed to be done to protect gay rights in Commonwealth countries. He said: 'It is an important document but it does not include any explicit commitment to gay rights. 'The Commonwealth Charter is a step forward for human rights in the member states but there's still much more to be done in terms of gay rights. 'Forty-one out of 54 Commonwealth states still criminalise homosexuality. 'There appears to be a clause in the charter to prohibit discrimination on 'other grounds' - this could be interpreted to cover homophobic discrimination but it will be down to the discretion of individual commonwealth countries.' A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'At a Commonwealth event, the Queen will sign a charter agreed upon by the 54 members of the Commonwealth. 'The Queen, as in all matters, is apolitical but is signing the document in her capacity as head of the Commonwealth.' The charter, agreed by all Commonwealth heads of government last December, will also endorse new legislation ending discrimination against women in the line of succession to the British throne. The Government is introducing new legislation ending discrimination against women in the line of succession to the British throne. The measure will mean that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first baby can succeed to the throne, regardless of whether the child is a girl or a boy. Ministers are set to introduce the new law after receiving consent from all the Commonwealth realms to push ahead with the change. The Succession to the Crown Bill will also end the ban on anyone in the line of succession marrying a Roman Catholic.","New charter will be signed in special ceremony to mark Commonwealth Day .

The trial of a mentally-ill man who hacked a psychotherapist to death with a meat cleaver begins today. Opening statements start on Monday in David Tarloff's murder trial after five years of uncertainty about whether he would ever be fit to stand in court. Kathryn Faughey was brutally killed by Tarloff, 44, at her Manhattan office in 2008. His lawyers don't dispute that he killed the 56-year-old but they argue . he was so psychotic that he shouldn't be held criminally responsible for . her death. Trial begins: Opening statements begin today in the case of David Tarloff who killed therapist Kathryn Faughey in Manhattan in 2008 . Prosecutors and Faughey's family say Tarloff carried out a considered, criminal plan. Tarloff admitted he wanted to rob Faughey's colleague with whom she shared an office to get money to take his sick mother to Hawaii. Tarloff was deemed mentally unfit for court months later. After doctors said his condition had improved, jury selection got started in 2010 but he was again declared unfit. Authorities say that Tarloff set out with a bag full of knives . to hold up his psychiatrist for . $40,000, grab his mother out of a nursing home and escape with her to . Hawaii. The case has stalled for years at a time because . of the schizophrenic's mental state, which halted an attempt to . try him in 2010. If the trial goes forward, jurors will be asked to decide whether . Tarloff, who has a decades-long history of hospitalizations and . hallucinations about God and Satan speaking to him, knew he was doing . wrong when he killed Faughey. Under arrest: David Tarloff's lawyer is pursuing a rare insanity defense in a case that highlights how the legal system tends to hold even severely mentally ill people accountable for answering criminal charges . They had never met. He had said he was frightened that she was going to attack him because her long fingernails alarmed him. 'Believe me, I wish she was never there - but I thought she was evil,' Tarloff told a psychologist in 2010. 'I went to kill her. I thought I . had no choice.' 'Everything about his thought process was so bizarre - so crazy - that . the proof in the case shows he was legally insane,' lawyer Bryan Konoski . has said. However prosecutors and Faughey's family feel that, whatever Tarloff's . illness, his actions bespoke a considered, violent scheme. 'He planned this out' and was heavily armed, said Owen Faughey, one of . her brothers. 'He was determined, it would seem, to stop anyone who . would interfere with his plan. And, unfortunately, that's where our . sister fell victim to his plan. He should be held fully accountable. Murdered: Psychotherapist Kathryn Faughey was fatally attacked with a meat cleaver at her office by David Tarloff in February 2008' It was an accident that Tarloff and Faughey, a 56-year-old therapist who . specialized in helping people with relationships, met at all. Faughey . shared an office with psychiatrist Dr Kent Shinbach, who treated . Tarloff in 1991 but hadn't seen him since. Yet in February 2008, as an increasingly panicky Tarloff tried to craft . what he saw as a rescue plan for his mother, he thought of Shinbach. He . figured the psychiatrist had money, and he'd get it from an ATM after . forcing the doctor to disclose his code, Tarloff later told police and . psychologists. 'I figured a little bump on the head. No one would know, and I would have $40,000,' Tarloff said. He went to Shinbach's office one evening with a rubber mallet, a set of . kitchen knives, rope, duct tape, a suitcase full of adult diapers and . clothing for his mother — and a belief that the plan had God's blessing, . he told a psychologist. He encountered Faughey instead and hacked her 15 times, then seriously wounded Shinbach when he tried to save her. Blessed: Years later, Tarloff told doctors he truly did no believe he had a choice in the murder . Tarloff, now 44, was a college student when his mind abruptly began . fracturing into paranoid suspicions of classmates and a preoccupation . with God and the devil. Over the years, as he was hospitalized more than a dozen times, he . recounted seeing 'Satan' spelled out in his mind and the 'eye of God' on . the kitchen floor, according to psychologists' reports and court . papers. He heard police sirens and concluded they'd been summoned by his . bad thoughts. He viewed pieces of paper on the street as a special . message from God. His relatives begged him to stay in mental hospitals or adult homes, but he left them, psychologists said. After his mother, Beatrice, moved from the Queens apartment they shared . into a nursing home in 2004, Tarloff grew still more erratic and . fixated. Convinced she wasn't getting good care at a series of homes, he . repeatedly clashed with staffers. Two weeks before Faughey's death, he . got arrested in a scuffle with a security guard at a hospital where his . mother was being treated. Manhunt: Police arrested Tarloff in 2008 at his Queens apartment building . 'Our mother is getting sick and it is making me extremely beyond any . normal patience furious and unnerved,' he wrote to his brother around . that time. Tarloff is pursuing an insanity defense. It requires proving not only . that he has a serious psychiatric disorder, but also that he didn't . understand the nature or consequences of his actions. Such defenses are offered for less than 1 per cent of felonies nationwide . and successful only about a quarter of the time, research has shown. When they do succeed, defendants are acquitted but held in secure mental . hospitals until - if ever - a judge decides they're safe to release. A jury was being chosen for Tarloff's trial in 2010 when he refused to . leave a courthouse holding cell, ran nude around a psychiatric ward and . was declared unfit for court, a finding separate from an insanity . defense.","David Tarloff, 44, killed Kathryn Faughey in 2008 at her Manhattan office ."

But at a gathering to mark his second birthday, restaurant staff helped Sonny Rees celebrate by serving him a large measure of whisky. Despite grimacing every time he took a sip, he managed to drink enough of the 40% ABV spirit to become intoxicated, say his parents. Mix-up: A family photo of Sonny Rees, two, tucking into a whisky and water in the Swansea branch of Frankie & Benny's on Saturday.

Immediately after tasting the drink . herself, worried mother Nina sought medical advice and took her son to . the casualty department of the nearest hospital. He was monitored and . later discharged. Yesterday Mrs Rees, 34, said the . incident at their local branch of restaurant chain Frankie and Benny’s . had wrecked her son’s birthday celebrations. All had started well enough. Sonny was . given a toy car by staff, and the family were eating their meals when . they noticed the boy was pulling a strange face every time he swallowed . what was supposed to be lime juice with water. Mrs Rees, a teacher, said: ‘When I . took a sip it was the unmistakable taste of whisky. No wonder he was . pulling a face.

However, Mrs Rees . telephoned NHS Direct which told her to get her son medical attention. She said: ‘They checked him over in . the hospital and they could see he was a bit drunk.

The family was given a 50 per cent . discount on their meal bill. Mrs Rees said: ‘I’m very disappointed with . Frankie and Benny’s – they ruined our day. We spent most of Sonny’s . birthday in hospital with him.’ It is believed Frankie and Benny’s was . also hosting a stag do and staff mixed up Sonny’s drink with a whisky . and water ordered by one of that group.

First picture: Public schoolboy Charlie Booth was found dead after apparently shooting himself with his father's gun . A 16-year-old private schoolboy has been found dead at home after apparently shooting himself with a gun belonging to his father. Charlie Booth was described by the head teacher of £10,000-a-year Gad’s Hill School in Kent as an ‘outstanding’ pupil with a ‘bright future ahead of him’. But the night before his death Charlie posted a message on Twitter saying: ‘Swear I get in s*** moods for no reason at the moment! Need to sort myself out.’ The teenager, whose body was found at the family’s £500,000 farmhouse on Friday night, indicated he was caught up in arguments. A few weeks earlier he had written tweets saying ‘Everything seems to run into an argument’ and ‘hate being stuck in the middle of stuff’ and referred to ‘people that can’t keep quiet’. Charlie’s mother Julia, 48, is a marketing assistant at nearby Cobham Hall boarding school and his father Nicholas, 52, is a director of a farm equipment supplier. There was no answer at their large red-bricked detached home down a private country lane near the village of Cobham yesterday. Charlie was a member of his school’s cadet force, in which pupils are trained in military activities including shooting.

The CEO of Delta Air Lines is asking the head of the Transportation Security Administration to reverse the agency's decision to allow small knives on commercial flights. CEO Richard Anderson expressed his concern in a letter to TSA Administrator John Pistole, saying the new policy could jeopardize the safety of passengers. The TSA said effective April 25, it . would allow small knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or less in . length and less than 1/2 inch wide. Safety first: Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson (in Dec. 2011) has written to TSA head John Pistole to ask that the agency not allow knives on commercial flights . Travelers will now be allowed to bring . golf clubs, ski poles and even small knives on planes with them since . aviation officials have announced significant security changes. Other items that will be allowed on . board again as part of a passenger's carry-on luggage include billiard . cues, ski poles, hockey sticks and lacrosse sticks. Items that had been prohibited like razors, box cutters or knives with a fixed blade are still not allowed on board. The restrictions about liquids are . still in place as well, meaning that anything under 3-ounces must be . declared at the security checkpoint. New rules: Flight attendants are balking at the new changes that will lift a number of prohibited items and allow travelers to carry on small knives on board . Remaining restrictions: TSA officials hope that by keeping some banned it will instill less fear in flyers . The TSA's announcement of the new policy has upset many families who lost loved ones in the 9/11 terror attacks. 'I'm really horrified and I would say . the majority of 9/11 family members are really shocked by it,' said . Sally Regenhard, the mother of firefighter Christian Regenhard who died . trying to save people in the World Trade Center. In addition, the Association of Professional . Flight attendants said it 'categorically rejects a proposal to allow knives of . any kind in the cabin,' and they don't understand why 'such a momentous . decision' was made without any consultation. As . for some of the larger items that they will now allow, like the sports . equipment, increases 'the potential for passengers getting hit with . these items during boarding and deplaning. It's a recipe for disaster,' said the APFA representative. 'This is part of an overall Risk-Based . Security approach, which allows Transportation Security officers to . better focus their efforts on finding higher-threat items such as . explosives,' he said. Specific: The TSA says that the changes reflect the findings of their recent review of security measures . Exemptions: Only certain bats are allowed but many think it is premature to allow any at all . The . Flight Attendants Union Coalition, which represents nearly 90,000 flight . attendants from carriers across the country, called the decision a . 'poor and shortsighted decision' by the TSA. 'As . the last line of defense in the cabin and key aviation partners, we . believe that these proposed changes will further endanger the lives of . all flight attendants and the passengers we work so hard to keep safe . and secure,' the coalition said in a statement.TSA spokesman . David Castelveter said the decision was made to bring U.S. regulations . more in line with International Civil Aviation Organization standards . and would also help provide a better experience for travelers. Loosening the reins: TSA officials have changed their stance on certain banned objects which will now be allowed on planes starting on April 25 . Many were surprised this week when the former head of transportation . security said the new policy . doesn't go far enough, and should include weapons such as 'battle axes' and 'machetes.' Kip Hawley, the former chief of the . Transportation Security Administration, said anything that wouldn't be . able to harm an aircraft's functionality should be allowed on board. 'In retrospect, I should have done . the same thing,' Hawley told CNN of the rule. 'The . air marshals and the flight attendants have legitimate concerns, . certainly, for their own safety, but the threat of taking over a plane . with a small, sharp instrument is zero,' Hawley said. 'You cannot . necessarily prevent violence on an airplane, but that is not the TSA's . mission. TSA's mission is to prevent a successful, catastrophic . terrorist attack, and you cannot get a successful, catastrophic . terrorist attack with a small knife or a Wiffle ball bat.' No longer a threat? Billiard cues and lacrosse sticks will be allowed on board now . 'They ought to let everything on that . is sharp and pointy,' Hawley said. 'Battle axes, machetes ... bring . anything you want that is pointy and sharp because while you may be able . to commit an act of violence, you will not be able to take over the . plane. It is as simple as that.' Hawley added, 'So my position would . be, bravo on the 2.6 inch knife. But why not take it all the way and . then really clean up the checkpoint where officers are focusing on bombs . and toxins, which are things that can destroy an airplane. And it would . smooth the process, cost less money, and be better security.' Explaining why axes and machetes . wouldn't do harm on an airplane, Hawley said, 'What are you going to do . when you get on board with a battle ax? Are you pull out your battle ax . and say, ""I'm taking over the airplane?"" You may be able to cut one or . two people, but pretty soon you would be down in the aisle and the . battle ax would be used on you.'","TSA announced a new policy this week to allow small knives onto commercial planes starting in April .

Lawyers and police studied plans of the bedroom and bathroom. A projector was used to beam the plans up for the public and press to see. Mr Botha said there was 'no way' he believed Pistorius's version of events. The runner has said he shot through the door while on his stumps but the . court heard the bullets' trajectory was through the top of the door. Mr Botha said he believed the bullets were fired down, suggesting that . Pistorius was wearing his prosthetic legs when the shots were . discharged. He said: 'I believe he knew she was in the bathroom and he shot four shots through the door.' The court heard that two mobile phones were seized at the property and neither had been used to call the police or paramedics. The court also heard today that two boxes of testosterone and needles were found in Pistorius's bedroom. And details were released of a row he allegedly had with a man over a . girl at Kyalami racetrack where Pistorius allegedly threatened to 'f*** . up' the rival. Family support: Oscar Pistorius' sister Aimee, brother Carl and father Henke in the courtroom on Wednesday . It was also claimed he was involved in another shooting at a restaurant . in Johannesburg in January and asked the gun owner to take . responsibility for the incident. Mr Botha said he wanted Pistorius charged additionally with a weapons . violation after unlicensed .38 calibre ammunition was found at the . house. The athlete - who was sobbing this morning in court - made notes with a silver pen as the case progressed. He told officials he had been a victim of crime and received death . threats, but today the court heard there were no records of this. In an affidavit, Pistorius has denied murdering the law graduate at his home in the early hours of Thursday. He has said they were in love and he thought Miss Steenkamp was in bed when he got up in the dark and blasted through the door. Pistorius's lawyer Barry Roux said it was not testosterone but a herbal remedy discovered in his client's bedroom. Tragic: Funeral of Reeva Steenkamp was held on Tuesday . Cross-examining Mr Botha, Mr Roux said a post-mortem examination showed Miss Steenkamp's bladder was empty. He said that was consistent with her getting up at 3am to go to the toilet. Mr Roux asked repeatedly why the police did not make simple checks - over the lighting and whether Pistorius had other phones. The lawyer said Pistorius phoned the housing complex manager for help at 3.19am then Netcare hospital a minute later. Mr Roux said the police discarded anything that might have been consistent with a defence. Officers found the victim covered in towels and wearing white shorts and a black top. Prosecutors believe Pistorius, who won two gold medals and a silver at . London's 2012 Paralympic Games, is a flight risk and oppose bail. Mr Botha said Pistorius, who had below-the-knee amputations when . he was 11 months old, has offshore accounts and a property in Italy. Media scrum: Journalists outside the Pretoria Magistrates' Court on Wednesday . Police escort: Pistorius arrives at the Pretoria Magistrates' Court . One witness said he heard a shot, followed 17 minutes later by more shots, Mr Botha said.'One of our witnesses heard a fight, two people talking loudly at each other ... from two in the morning to three,' he said, adding that the witness was about 1,000ft away. Members of the Women's League of the ruling African National Congress protested outside the red-brick court, waving placards saying 'No Bail for Pistorius' and 'Rot in jail'. The case has stunned sports fans worldwide. But it has been felt most acutely in South Africa, where Pistorius was seen as a hero who transcended racial divides that persist nearly 20 years after the end of apartheid. He carried South Africa's flag at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics, and American magazine Sports Illustrated named him as one of the most inspiring figures of the year. The sprinter's endorsements and sponsorships included Nike, telecoms firm BT, sunglasses maker Oakley and French designer Thierry Mugler and were thought to be worth as much as two million US dollars (£1.3 million) a year. Nike and Mugler both said they have dropped Pistorius from advertising campaigns, and Clarins cosmetics firm said it was recalling its A Man perfume range out of 'respect and compassion towards the families involved'. The hearing was adjourned to tomorrow morning when a decision over bail might be made. The court will resume at 11am in Pretoria (9am GMT).

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 01:11 EST, 11 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:11 EST, 11 March 2013 . It sounds like the premise for a new reality TV series: 'Hurricane House' - people scouring waterside communities looking to buy homes damaged by Superstorm Sandy at a deep discount. While there are bargains out there, ranging from 10 per cent off pre-storm prices for upscale homes on New York's Long Island and the Jersey Shore to as much as 60 per cent off modest bungalows in Staten Island and Queens, it's still very much a game of buyer beware. Not only are buyers are on the hook for repairs and in some cases total rebuilds, they're also wading into a host of potentially expensive uncertainties about new flood maps and future insurance rates, zoning changes and updated building codes. One man's junk...: Some Hurricane Sandy-damaged homes are being sold at a song for opportunists looking to get some prime real estate at a fraction of the cost . Worth the price? Buyers are on the hook for repairs and in some cases total rebuilds for the properties purchased, as well as new flood maps and future insurance rates, zoning changes and updated building codes . 'It's totally changed the way I sell real estate,' said Lawrence Greenberg, a sales associate with Van Skiver Realtors, whose own Mantoloking, New Jersey, office was wrecked in the storm. Prior to Sandy, prospective buyers rarely mentioned issues such as flood maps and building elevations until the matter of flood insurance came up - often at closing. 'Now, everybody asks the question of elevation,' Greenberg said. Even if potential buyers plan to tear down and build new, they ask about the pending changes in flood maps proposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, because flood insurance rates will depend upon the new zones. There is no sign of a mass exodus from shoreline communities. The number of for-sale listings in January in the 380 zip codes hit by the storm was about 2 per cent below the same time last year, according to online real estate information company Zillow Inc. That indicates that most homeowners are rebuilding, or have not yet decided how to proceed. Sell or rebuild? The number of for-sale listings in January in the 380 zip codes hit by Sandy was about 2 per cent below the same time last year, indicating homeowners' possible desire to rebuild . Buyer beware: New listings range from destroyed oceanfront properties being sold for the land, to flooded bayside homes untouched since the storm that must be gutted . But real estate agents in New York and New Jersey say the majority of homes for sale in these areas have some damage from the October 29 storm, and it appears to them that a rising number are being put on the market as the spring home-buying season approaches. New listings range from destroyed oceanfront properties being sold for the land, to flooded bayside homes untouched since the storm that must be gutted. Even the few undamaged homes in affected neighborhoods are listing at prices about 10 per cent lower than they would have been pre-storm. Some sellers are overwhelmed by the daunting prospect of restoring a damaged home. Some are older homeowners who had stayed in the houses where they raised their families, but now are relocating. Some didn't have flood insurance. Despair: Some sellers are overwhelmed by the daunting prospect of restoring a damaged home . 'They either don't have the funds or don't have the energy to go through the renovating and rebuilding process,' said Jeff Childers, a broker with Childers Sotheby's International Realty in Normandy Beach, New Jersey. Lisa Jackson, broker and owner of Rockaway Properties in the Belle Harbor section of Queens, New York, said a number of her new listings are homes owned by senior citizens. One 85-year-old client was living alone in her 1940s-era six-bedroom, six-bath brick home right on the beach. The house was hammered by Sandy, and must be at least partially demolished, but will still command a hefty price. 'Everything on the water is big money,' Jackson said. But the $3million listing price is nevertheless a huge discount from the roughly $4.25million it would have commanded before the storm. Another set of sellers were in the process of getting out before the storm hit. Questions: In places like Mantoloking, New Jersey, pictured, try to rebuild, prospective homebuyers are often asking about elevation and flood insurance . Fixer upper: Superstorm Sandy has forced some desirable beachfront homes to become much more affordable, if the buyer is willing to do some work . Jackson had 18 properties in contract prior to Sandy, but all of those sales either fell through or were renegotiated for a lower price. One 1930s-era three-bedroom, two-bath house with a view of the bay was in contract for $665,000, but the entire first floor was gutted after it took on about four feet of water. The buyer, a single woman, was unwilling to take on the renovations. The property is back on the market for $550,000. That's a 17 per cent discount, but the eventual buyer will have to pay for new floors and walls, plus a new kitchen and bathroom. Still, that sort of cut might make the neighborhood affordable for a family that was priced out in recent years, when houses were selling for $750,000 and more. Repairs: Some homebuyers are looking into the opportunity to turn a home gutted by the storm into their beachfront dream house . And in one sense, buying a storm-damaged home can offer an advantage, said Tom Tripodi, president of the Tripodi Group/ Douglas Elliman Real Estate in the Long Island city of Long Beach, where damaged houses are selling for about 10 per cent less than before the storm. 'If it's all gutted out, you can do what you want,' he said. 'You can own the house with a brand new kitchen, new appliances, new floors.' In addition to people looking to create their dream house out of a damaged home, Tripodi has seen investors eyeing the area. In Long Beach's West End neighborhood, for example, investors are looking to tear down gutted 1920s-era ranch homes and build bigger houses with multiple stories at higher elevations in their place. The shorefront sections of Staten Island are also seeing accelerating turnover of homes that are likely to eventually get torn down. Lee Venezia, a broker with Neuhaus Realty Inc., recently sold three adjacent bungalows owned by a longtime resident of Staten Island's Midland Beach for $240,000 cash - about $20,000 less than each one might have garnered before the storm. 'The homeowner refused to go back,' she said. Another chance: Investors have also been seen dishing out cash for what they hope is a big payoff for properties that bared the brunt of Sandy . The buyer will fix the properties up and rent them 'until the dust settles,' Venezia said. Once new flood maps are finalized and new building codes sorted out, she expects the houses to be sold again to a developer who will replace them. Cash deals are the only ones closing right now in Staten Island's storm-damaged neighborhoods, Venezia said, which means the buyers are almost all investors, even though the area's small houses are selling for $85,000 to $100,000. 'Banks are not going to lend,' she said. 'The banks are waiting for the dust to settle to see what the building requirements are going to be.' The new flood maps must go through public hearings before they are finalized, a process likely to take two to three years. Meanwhile, public officials and homeowners are trying to look to the future. New beginning: Listings in New York and New Jersey range from destroyed oceanfront properties being sold for the land, to flooded bayside homes untouched since the storm that must be gutted . New York Gov Andrew Cuomo recently announced a plan to buy out the entire Staten Island neighborhood of Oakwood Beach and allow the land to revert back to the marshland it once was, because the homes there have flooded multiple times. It remains unclear if any other neighborhoods might get bought out. That may be the best hope for homeowners like Michael Kuhens, who has been trying to sell his bungalow in Staten Island's Ocean Breeze section, which was ripped off its foundation by the 14-foot storm surge. A buyout would be attractive because, instead of dealing with bargain hunters, the state is offering pre-storm value. 'I know a lot of people in my neighborhood don't want to stay, and if they were offered a buyout they'd take it,' said Kuhens, who is staying at his parents' house with his wife and 1-year-old daughter. 'We just want to get on with our lives. It's a hundred-something days after the storm, and we're still stuck in limbo.'","Discounts of up to 60 per cent off are being offered on some properties damaged or leveled by Superstorm Sandy .

A dairyman who killed a 22-month-old girl in a 'tragedy of untold proportions' when he reversed over her in a milk float has been spared custody. Christopher Davidson, 20, was reversing at around 14mph in Halifax, West Yorkshire, when he collided with Zoya Hussain who ran into the road from between two parked cars. The toddler died the following day with abdominal and head injuries from being run over by both the back and front wheels of the float. Christopher Davidson (left), outside Bradford Crown Court, killed 22-month-old Zoya Hussain (right) when he was driving a milk float in Halifax . Davidson, who was 18 at the time of the collision, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at Bradford Crown Court. He . was handed a 10-month sentence in a young offenders' institution, . suspended for two years, and was ordered to do 250 hours of unpaid work. Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC described Davidson's driving as 'remarkably foolish'. He . said: 'A 22-month-old child who wandered from the safety of her home . into the street lost her life instantaneously when the front and rear . wheels of the milk lorry went over the child. 'This is a tragedy of untold proportions. Nothing this court can do can bring this child back. 'My . sympathies and sensitivities are with the family of the child who was . killed by a remarkably foolish but short-lived piece of driving by an . otherwise decent young man.' The court heard Zoya would have been visible to Davidson for around 0.8 seconds before the impact . Davidson, of Halifax, was collecting money on a milk round at around 5.30pm on August 25, 2011. Nick . Adlington, prosecuting, told the court Davidson was aware that children . were playing in the street and did not ask his colleague to watch for . hazards as he reversed. Davidson . reversed around 60 metres down the road when he saw a blur in his wing . mirror as Zoya ran into his path and heard a bang as the milk float hit . her, Mr Adlington said. He braked but the front and back wheels reversed over the little girl before the vehicle could stop. It was calculated that Zoya would have been visible to Davidson for around 0.8 seconds before the impact. Experts . found that if Davidson was travelling more slowly, the milk float could . have stopped before the wheels ran over the toddler, or the collision . could have been avoided completely. Mr Adlington said Davidson's speed was 'unsafe for the conditions'. Judge Durham Hall said Zoya's family, who were not in court today, had experienced the 'ultimate nightmare of any parent'. Sentencing Davidson, he said: 'The little girl's family will have a lifetime of unthinkable despair, for you cannot recover from the death of a child.' He continued: 'Speed kills. Speed, and the devices to control it, are not nuisances to be avoided and cheated. Speed kills. And in your case, your speed killed that little girl.' Judge Durham Hall said Davidson, who was described as a 'thoroughly decent, hard-working, law-abiding young man', would have to live with what he had done for the rest of his life. 'It was an error, for which you directly and fully bear responsibility, which robbed a 22-month-old baby girl of her life,' he said. 'Your driving was inappropriate, was careless and you caused the death.' He added: 'You reversed too fast, too long, in a completely risk-full situation with a restricted view.' Davidson, who stood in the dock wearing a dark-coloured suit and tie, showed no emotion as he was sentenced. He was disqualified from driving for two-and-a-half years.","Christopher Davidson, 20, was reversing at 14mph  when he crashed .

A U.S. judge sentenced the girlfriend of reputed mob boss James 'Whitey' Bulger to eight years in prison on Tuesday for her role in helping him evade arrest for 16 years. District Judge Douglas Woodlock also imposed on Catherine Greig a $150,000 fine and ordered her to serve three years of supervised release once she is out of prison. Rather than face trial Greig, 61, pleaded guilty in March to charges of conspiracy to harbor a fugitive, conspiracy to commit identity fraud, and identity fraud. Prosecutors had sought 10 years in prison while her attorney had recommended 27 months. Jailed: This undated file photo provided by the U.S. Marshals Service shows Catherine Greig, the longtime girlfriend of Whitey Bulger captured with Bulger June 22, 2011, in Santa Monica, California . Caught: A man resembling fugitive Boston Irish mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger, 78, and a woman resembling his girlfriend Catherine Greig, 56, are seen in this picture taken in Italy April 10, 2007 . Woodlock told Greig that she had to take responsibility for her own choices made over the many years that Bulger was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. 'We are all responsible for what we do ... we all make choices,' Woodlock said. Greig, in blue prison jumpsuit, briefly nodded at her twin sister, Margaret McCusker, before being led out of the packed courtroom in downtown Boston. Outside the courtroom, McCusker said merely that she 'loves her sister.' She showed no emotion when Woodlock handed down the sentence after listening to emotional pleas from relatives of those Bulger is accused of killing. Bulger, the 82-year-old former leader of the notorious Winter Hill Gang. Earlier, Woodlock had indicated he was leaning toward a comparatively long sentence for Greig because of her active role in helping Bulger, who is accused of 19 murders from the 1970s and 1980s, hide from authorities . 'The defendant was involved in more than merely providing shelter to Mr. Bulger, she provided a variety of things, and engaged in criminal activity,' Woodlock said. Rejoicing: Victims' family members, Steve Davis, left, and Tommy Donahue clasp hands as they react outside federal court in Boston on Tuesday, June 12, 2012, after Catherine Greig, who spent 16 years on the run with former Boston mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger, was sentenced to eight years in prison . Triumphant: U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz speaks to reporters as FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers, rear left, watches outside federal court in Boston on Tuesday, June 12, 2012 . Judgement: This courtroom sketch depicts Catherine Greig, second from right, during a hearing before Magistrate Judge Jennifer Boal, right, in a federal courtroom in Boston Monday, July 11, 2011 . Greig and Bulger, 82, were arrested on June 22, 2011, in an apartment hideout in Santa Monica, California, blocks from the Pacific Ocean, where they had lived under a number of fake and stolen identities for most of their years on the run. Pictured: An undated FBI handout photo released Wednesday, Dec. 30, 1998, showing reputed Boston mobster and fugitive James Bulger . A cache of some 30 weapons as well as more than $800,000 in cash was hidden in a hole in the wall. Much of the pre-sentencing debate centered on Greig's knowledge of, and access, to, the guns. Greig's lawyer, Kevin Reddington, urged the judge to impose a sentence of a little over two years, arguing that Greig was in love with Bulger when she fled Boston with him in 1995. 'Catherine Greig fell in love with Mr. Bulger, and that's why she was in the situation she was in,' Reddington said. 'Miss Greig did not believe that Mr. Bulger was capable of these homicides.' But prosecutors dismissed her professions of love and said Greig had numerous opportunities to leave Bulger during their time on the run. 'This was not a romantic saga,' U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said. 'She helped and protected and concealed a fugitive.' Before sentencing, the court heard emotional testimony from the families of some of Bulger's alleged victims. 'She was not held against her will . ... She was a willing supporter and co-conspirator of Whitey Bulger,' said Steve Davis, whose 26-year-old sister, Debra, was one of Bulger's . alleged victims. 'She doesn't even have the heart to look any of us in . the eye.' Tim . Connors, whose father Edward was allegedly shot by Bulger in 1975, said . Greig was 'a cold-hearted criminal (who) never showed any sympathy . toward any of us.'

Handout: Reputed mobster James J. Bulger appears in two Federal Bureau of Investigation handout photographs.

Wanted man: The photos left and center are FBI handout photos of fugitive Massachusetts mobster Bulger, taken in the 1980s and his girlfriend, Catherine Greig, right, who travels with the former gangster . 'You're as much a criminal as Whitey and should be treated as such,' he said. Patricia Donahue, the widow of Michael Donahue, a truck driver who prosecutors say was killed by Bulger in 1982, said she believes Greig is responsible for Bulger being able to remain a fugitive for so long. 'I believe he never would have survived all those years without her help,' she said. Greig did not flinch at their words, and did not turn to look at the families. She also declined to address the court. Greig's . lawyer had appealed for leniency, asking the judge to give her 27 . months in prison. After the sentencing, Reddington told reporters that . Greig has no regrets about what she did. 'He's the love of her life and she stands by him ... of course she doesn't regret it,' Reddington said. Greig, a former dental hygienist and dog groomer, faced a maximum of 15 years - five years on each of the three charges. She had been with Bulger for more . than three decades, first as a secret girlfriend he kept on the side . while he lived with another woman, then as the faithful woman who left . behind her life in Massachusetts so she could go on the run with him. FBI: Images of Catherine Greig, including some that are age enhanced and retouched, are seen in this June 23, 2011 screen grab taken from the FBI's Wanted website . Captured: Steven Martinez, (C) FBI assistant director in charge in Los Angeles, Douglas Price, (L) FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge, and LAPD Deputy Chief, David Doan, Chief of Detectives, during a news conference to discuss the arrest of Boston crime boss James Bulger and his companion Catherine Greig at the Los Angeles Federal Building on June 23, 2011 in Los Angeles, California . Greig's plea deal with prosecutors doesn't require her to cooperate in the case against Bulger. After she was sentenced, Ortiz said prosecutors aren't trying to compel her to testify against him. 'That's not something we're seeking,' Ortiz said. 'We indicted and we're ready to prosecute without her help.' In her plea agreement, Greig admitted that she used aliases, unlawfully obtained identification documents and repeatedly helped Bulger get prescription medication from a pharmacy by pretending to be his wife. Greig and Bulger traveled extensively during their first year on the run - to Chicago, New York City, Grand Isle, La., and other places - but then settled in a two-bedroom rented apartment in Santa Monica. Last June, Bulger and Greig were apprehended just days after the FBI began a new publicity campaign focusing on Greig. Bulger has pleaded not guilty to charges linked to 19 murders in the 1970s and 1980s, when prosecutors say he ran the mostly Irish-American gang. The accused mob boss fled Boston in 1994 after getting a tip from a corrupt FBI agent that authorities were closing in on him. Greig joined Bulger a few weeks later. Bulger's trial is scheduled to start on November 5 although his lawyers have said they need more time to sift through hundreds of thousands of pages of evidence.

Expensive tastes: Christopher Travis has over 80 previous convictions, nearly half for eating at Michelin starred restaurants and refusing to pay . A fraudster with expensive tastes for eating out at Michelin starred restaurants and then refusing to pay has been jailed for two years, after already being banned from every restaurant in Britain. Christopher Travis, 53, has enjoyed sumptuous meals at some of the country’s most exclusive restaurants without paying a penny, doing a runner before he paid the bill. Travis now has more than 80 previous convictions, nearly half for eating meals in Michelin starred restaurants and pubs before doing a runner. The man, who is homeless, already has an ASBO banning him from every restaurant in Britain which he breached for a fourteenth time, a court heard. Making his 88th court appearance today, Travis admitted eating yet another free meal at tapas bar Lorenzos Spanish restaurant in Plymouth, Devon. He ate several dishes and drank glasses of wine on January 14 before informing staff that he had only 20p on him. Travis has now swapped gourmet cuisine for prison food after a judge proved that there is no such thing as a free lunch and sentenced him to jail. The court heard Travis had ‘bilked’ at restaurants across the country including Devon, Cornwall, Derby, Oxford and Lincoln. Prosecuting, Alistair Verheijen said: ‘On the day in question the defendant went to Lorenzos restaurant, where he ordered food and drink to the value of £20.45. ‘When he finished the bill was presented and he appeared to pat himself before telling staff he was unable to pay. 'Free' meal: Making his 88th court appearance today, Travis admitted eating yet another free meal at tapas bar Lorenzos Spanish restaurant (pictured) in Plymouth, Devon . ‘He asked them if he could defer the payment which was refused and then he was asked if he had a friend who could pay for him, he replied not. ‘He went on to tell them he had been in and out of prison and wanted to go back.’ Travis admitted breaching his Asbo and fraud by false representation. Jailing him, Judge Paul Darlow said: ‘You made an order and patted your pockets. You knew you weren’t going to pay for that. ‘That was an act of fraud, dishonesty and obtaining services. It was also a breach of the anti-social behaviour order. ‘You have been before this court time and time and time again for exactly the same sort of behaviour.’ In June 2010 he was given his three year Asbo at South Derbyshire Magistrates’ Court after he dined out at a Derby restaurant and ran off without paying the bill. Travis was undeterred, however, conning several more free meals in Lincolnshire in 2011 before dodging a £17.85 bill at an Oxford restaurant he had already cheated three times. Restaurant ban: Travis, who has an ASBO banning him from every restaurant in Britain, has breached it 14 times including at the Royal Clarence Hotel (pictured) in Exeter, where he enjoyed a three-course meal just three days after his release from prison . Jeremy Mogford, owner of the Old Bank Hotel and Quod, said afterwards: ‘He has got away with this crime again and again.’ Three days after finishing time in prison Travis’ next culinary con involved a three-course meal at celebrity chef Michael Caines’ Royal Clarence Hotel. After his 2012 night out at the Michelin star restaurant in Devon he said he didn’t have any money for the £51.52 bill, earning him another spell in jail. During the most recent trial his defence team admitted he had expensive tastes and ‘doesn’t choose the bottom end of the scale when targeting his restaurants’. Defending, Malcolm Clark, said Travis wanted to rehabilitate himself and had enrolled in an Open University course. Mr Clark said: ‘He is not an uneducated man, he has served in the Army but now the time has come that he wants help but wants to help himself.’","Christopher Travis has more than 80 previous convictions .

Former Florida Gov Jeb Bush likened the media to 'crack and heroin addicts' in an awkward rant when asked on Sunday about whether or not he would seek to run for president in 2016. It was the end of a busy week of public appearances for Bush - including five on Sunday alone - as he plugs his new book, Immigration Wars. On NBC's 'Meet the Press,' the strain of the book tour appeared to be getting to him when he was asked by host David Gregory about the prospect of following in his father and brother's footsteps. Scroll down for video . Firing back: On Meet the Press, former Florida Gov Jeb Bush, right, likened reporters to 'crack and heroin addicts' in an awkward rant when asked by David Gregory, left, if he would seek the White House in 2016 . Gregory asked: 'Who's the hottest Florida politician right now? Is it you or Marco Rubio? Who are we more likely to see in the White House?' In response, Bush said: 'Man, you guys are crack addicts. You really are obsessed with all this politics.' The 'Meet the Press' host interrupted, saying he'd been called a lot of things, but never a crack addict. 'OK, heroin addict. Is that better?' Bush shot back. Bush is one of a handful of potential Republican contenders in the public eye in recent months, a list that also includes Rubio, of Florida, Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie. 'We've got big challenges, and Marco . Rubio, to his credit, is working on those. And he deserves a lot of . credit for it, and I'm very proud of him,' Jeb Bush said of his . potential rival. Mr 2016? Bush is one of a handful of potential Republican contenders in the public eye in recent months, a list that also includes Sen Marco Rubio, Gov Bobby Jindal and Gov Chris Christie . After Bush left the Florida governor's office in 2007, some urged him to jump into the 2012 race against President Barack Obama. But his brother's low approval ratings could have dragged him down, and there seemed little interest in a national campaign. But with Republicans looking for a new message and messenger, Jeb Bush is signaling he's open to the possibility. Family ties: Jeb Bush doesn't like to speculate about whether he'd like to follow in his father's footsteps . 'I'm not saying yes. I'm just not saying no,' Bush told NBC News last week. Speaking to CNN's State of the Union, Bush said it is too early to seriously ponder a bid for the White House. 'When you asked me before 2012 - Was I . going to run in 2012? - and I said no, I went through the process and . decided it wasn't appropriate.'

A passage in his book proposes a path to legal residency for undocumented immigrants but tough conditions for citizenship. 'I haven't changed,' he said on CBS's Face the Nation. 'I support a path to legalization or citizenship so long as the path for people that have been waiting patiently is easier and costs less - the legal entrance to our country - than illegal entrance.' Republicans have become more favorable to the idea of a path to citizenship since losing the Hispanic vote by a big margin in November, and Bush said he backs bipartisan Senate efforts to develop a comprehensive immigration plan led by a group including Rubio.

'Momentum': Baroness Parminter wants a commitment for a charge on plastic bags . Senior Liberal Democrats have called for a charge on plastic bags to be included in this month's Budget. They argue it is time for the Coalition to take firm action to slash the numbers handed out to shoppers in England, despite the concerns of the Treasury. Nick Clegg and David Cameron have both voiced support for reducing the environmental impact of bags on the landscape and wildlife, highlighted by the Daily Mail's Banish the Bags campaign. But they have fallen short of imposing a ban. However support is said to be mounting within the Deputy Prime Minister's party who feel their ministers are in a strong position, following their win in the by-election in Eastleigh, to make demands in the Budget negotiations. A 5p charge has already succeeded in slashing the numbers of bags handed out in Wales over the past year, a charge begins in Northern Ireland next month, and plans for one are under consideration in Scotland. Yesterday the party's environment spokesman in the Lords, Baroness Parminter of Godalming, said there was 'growing momentum' for measures in England. She said: 'This is the direction of travel and I and others would like to see it resolved with a formal commitment by the Government to introduce charges on plastic bags in the lifetime of this parliament. There is growing momentum for it.' Success: A 5p charge has led to a reduction in the numbers of bags handed out in Wales . She said charges would deliver financial as well as environmental benefits, as householders are paying the 'hidden costs' of disposing of millions of plastic bags on their council tax bills. Plastic carrier bags are typically used for just 20 minutes, and either end up in landfill or can blight the landscape and seas for hundreds of years, killing wildlife and birds. Baroness Parminter, a former chief executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: 'We would favour something along the Welsh lines of a 5p charge, going up to a maximum of 10p, and encouraging the supermarkets to give the money to local charities and community food projects.' Baroness Parminter said the only countries in Europe who do not have an agreement to curtail the use of bags are England, Finland, Poland and Greece. Environmental hazard: A sperm whale died after swallowing 40lb of plastic dumped by farmers . She said the Government should take the lead and ban bags itself, as legislation could be imposed by the European Union under a directive next year to reduce packaging. Yesterday an aide to George Osborne, Amber Rudd, said ministers wanted to cut plastic bag use without imposing a new tax. The Tory MP for Hastings and Rye said: 'I find that my local supermarkets are charging me for plastic bags. 'There's a kind of shame factor to it, 'did you bring your own bags' they say and I think that's working quite well. 'We don't like introducing new taxes, Britons are finding it difficult enough with their cost of living. Let people try and adjust before introducing a new tax.'

Sheryl Sandberg is a crusader for female empowerment in the workplace – but that doesn’t mean women are in charge. Speaking with CBS News' '60 Minutes' on the eve of . the release of her controversial new book, ‘Lean In: Women, Work and the . Will to Lead,’ Sandberg said: ‘The very blunt truth is that men still . run the world.’ When asked if she intends to start a revolution, the millionaire and Facebook COO replied: ‘Yes, I think so.’ Scroll down for video . Lean in: Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, said that men still dominate the workforce and things need to change . Publicity tour: Sandberg has been in New York City to promote her new book, and took time to grab a slice . Author: Sheryl Sandberg's new book Lean In will be out on bookstore shelves on March 11 . In a lengthy interview with CBS’ ’60 . Minutes,’ Sandberg, 43, spoke with Norah O’Donnell over the challenges . that modern women face, and said that they are stalled in their rise to . power. Herself a Harvard graduate with a very impressive resume, she currently works as Facebook’s number two in command – right next to its founder, Mark Zuckerberg. But what’s been getting the most attention is her crusade to bring awareness to workplace inequality, and the strains put upon working women who also want to have families. Sandberg has suggested that there are so few women running companies because they self-impose limits. The title of her book is derived from a 2010 TED talk where she said that women hurt themselves by leaning back. ‘They say, I’m busy or I want to have a child one day, I couldn’t possibly take on any more. 'Or I’m still learning my current job. I’ve never heard a man say that to me,’ Sandberg said. Sandberg herself was admittedly reluctant to accept her high school yearbook’s award after she was voted ‘Most Likely to Succeed.’ ‘I was embarrassed,’ the mother of two said. ‘My entire life I have been told…or I have felt that I should hold back on being too successful, too smart, too – you know – lots of things.’ But the COO made it clear that she is not blaming professional women for the lack of female executives in the workforce. A woman on the move: Sandberg, 43, is launching her book today, and is featured on the cover of this week's Time magazine . ‘There’s an awful lot we don’t . control. I’m saying that there’s an awful lot we can control and we can . do for ourselves to sit at more tables, raise more hands.’ She . also said that while marriage is the largest personal decision a person . can make in their lives, choosing a spouse has extreme implications in . the workplace too. ‘Partner with the right person because you cannot . have a full career and a full life at home with the children if you are . also doing all the housework and childcare.’ Sandberg . has most recently been in New York City to promote her book. In a . whirlwind of publicity, she has also been featured in Vanity Fair and . appears on the March 18 cover of Time magazine. Controversy: Sandberg has not helped herself with divisive speeches in which she has said: 'The moment a woman starts thinking about having a child, she doesn't raise her hand anymore' Speaking out: Facebook chief operating officer Cheryl Sandberg, who has a personal fortune of $500million, says that there were things beyond the control of women that were holding them back . The . Facebook guru, who was ranked by Forbes as the tenth most powerful . woman in the U.S., has been criticized for being out-of-touch with the . modern working woman because of her extreme wealth. According . to Forbes, Sandberg made nearly $31million in 2011, including her base . salary for Facebook and around $30million in stock options. Sandberg . told O’Donnell in the interview: 'I am not saying everyone has the . resources or opportunities I have. I am not saying every husband is . going to wake up tomorrow, read a book and do his share. I'm saying that . women need to own the power that they have, negotiate for raises.' Counterpoint: Anne-Marie Slaughter's buzzworthy Atlantic cover story from last June argued against Sandberg's speeches . Sandberg’s . book tour touches on a hot-button topic, and comes to a vastly . different conclusion than Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former director of . policy planning for the U.S. State Department and author of last year's . zeitgeist piece, 'Why Women Still Can't Have It All.' Writing . in The Atlantic, Slaughter argued that it was difficult to be away from . her son when he needed her, and impossible to find a good role model of . a successful, happy, well-rested woman who ‘had it all’ and . deconstructed much of what Sandberg said in her 2011 commencement speech . at Barnard and her TED talk the year before. In . the book Sandberg writes that the the feminist revolution has 'stalled' and that women earn 20 per cent less than men over their lifetime if . they decide to have children. She also uses vivid analogies to describe what it is like to be a woman at work. She . writes: ‘Imagine that a career is like a marathon ... a marathon where . both men and women arrive at the starting line equally fit and trained. The gun goes off.

Kate Torpey claims Jigsaw bosses told her she would be 'totally useless' because she had two children . The boss of an upmarket fashion group told a female executive she would be ‘totally useless’ as chief finance officer if she had two children, a tribunal heard. Kate Torpey claims the comment was made by her former boss John Robinson – founder and owner of Jigsaw – when she just had one child. But she claims she was twice overlooked for the role of chief finance officer – both times after she had again become pregnant. She is suing Robinson Webster Holdings for sex discrimination, unfair dismissal, and discrimination on the grounds of maternity. Mrs Torpey enjoyed a glittering career at the company behind Jigsaw and Kew, another women’s clothes shop, a tribunal was told. She joined the company – where the Duchess of Cambridge once worked – as a financial control assistant in 1996 at the age of 24, before being appointed a director of Jigsaw in 2003 and managing director of Kew in 2004, it was said. She gave birth to her first daughter in January 2009, and admitted she was ‘worried’ about taking maternity leave. Mrs Torpey, who earned £150,000 a year, told the tribunal: ‘I recall John telling me proudly more than once prior to my pregnancy that his wife had returned to work within days of the birth of one of their children. ‘I felt he was suggesting that he thought other women took an unnecessarily long time off after giving birth.’ After returning to work in September 2009, Mrs Torpey had a meeting with Mr Robinson in which she told him she wanted to go back to work as managing director of Kew four days a week, it was claimed. She told the hearing: ‘Although I did not note it down, I also remember that he said if I wanted two children then trying to do my job would be “totally useless”.’ Kate Torpey had a glittering career at the company behind Jigsaw until dropping the 'bombshell' she was pregnant for a third time . Nick Bartlett, a human resources worker at Jigsaw, said the business has many women employees with children . She claims director Charlie Atterton . suggested a four-day-a-week finance director role, but said Mr Robinson . ‘vetoed’ this at a board meeting in January 2010 – the same day she told . him she was pregnant for a second time. After giving birth, she . returned to work in May 2011, and that September the prospect of her . becoming CFO was again discussed. Mrs Torpey said Mr Atterton agreed . with the decision to offer her the CFO roll until she dropped the . ‘bombshell’ that she was pregnant again. Mr Atterton then told her that Mr . Robinson was ‘not happy to continue’ appointing her as CFO, she claims. She was signed off sick with anxiety in November 2011 and resigned the . following month. Robinson Webster deny the claims . against them.

Political pawn: Lingerie model Louise Cole (pictured) was unwittingly touted as a 'nurse' on a Lib Dem website boasting tax cuts for 'ordinary workers' A pretty nurse touted as an 'ordinary worker' on a Lib Dem website has been uncovered as an underwear model who once stood against them. Lingerie model Louise Cole is seen dressed in a nurse's outfit and carrying a clipboard under a headline boasting a '£600 tax cut for every ordinary worker in the country'. But the ordinary 'health professional' has been uncovered as stunning underwear model Louise who stood against the Lib Dems for the Miss Great Britain Party. Sexy Louise, 34, stood in the Henley by-election promising 'to make Westminster sexy not sleazy'. The Wonderbra model was yesterday unaware her nurse's outfit shoot was being used by Nick Clegg's party to boast about helping the 'ordinary worker'. Louise said: 'I did a modelling job as a nurse and they must have used a picture from that.' But stunning Louise, who models for the luxury lingerie labels Gossard and Berlei, admits she could never make it as a nurse. 'I don't think that is for me, I'm not very good with gore and blood,' she said. Louise, of Chichester, Sussex, stood against the Lib Dems in 2008 for the Miss Great Britain Party. She said the minority party - made up of candidates who had previously stood in the beauty pageant - was 'a good, fun, experience' but the Westminster political life was not for her. 'There are other things I would rather do,' the successful underwear and swimwear model said. Political opponents last night branded the gaffe an embarrassment for the Lib Dems, who are currently in the middle of their party conference in Brighton. 'Embarrassing gaffe': Louise is seen dressed in a nurse's outfit and carrying a clipboard under a headline boasting a '£600 tax cut for every ordinary worker in the country' Up front: Louise stood in the Henley by-election promising 'to make Westminster sexy not sleazy' Labour MP for Newport East Jessica Morden said: 'That the Lib Dems struggle to find real people willing to endorse them is of no surprise, given how quickly they betrayed their principles at the prospect of power. 'With form for dressing up staff in costumes to use as endorsers in the past, this is another embarrassing gaffe from an increasingly out of touch party.' In 2010 a Lib-Dem member of staff was caught out posing as a nurse in a party election leaflet. It showed Cardiff North candidate John Dixon talking to a woman wearing a nurse's uniform - who turned out to be a female party official in an outfit. The Liberal Democrats yesterday played down the incident. A spokesman said: 'Nurses, models, teachers, workers on low and middle incomes, Labour supporters, Lib Dems and even the Tories will have £600 taken off their income tax bill every year thanks to what the Lib Dems are doing in government. 'We want to create a stronger economy and a fairer society and our income tax policy is helping over a million workers in Wales.'","Louise Cole, 34, shown in nurse's outfit under headline boasting tax cuts for 'every ordinary worker'

The 54-year-old is being sued by a former housekeeper less than a year after her children's nanny filed a racism complaint against the actress. Stone's maid Angelica Castillo is seeking unspecified damages from the Basic Instinct star for wrongful termination and wrongful retaliation, reports RadarOnline.

The housekeeper - who started working . for Stone in 2010 - injured her back while loading heavy bags of groceries . into her car while on a grocery run for Stone. Castillo . was ordered by her doctor to 'undertake a brief period of bed rest,' says RadarOnline.

His alarm rings at 7.30am, he showers, eats cornflakes and, when he is meeting lawyers, dresses in a jaunty orange Hermès tie and navy pinstripe suit that hangs off him after losing 20lb on his prison diet. After a day emailing friends and writing physics papers from a small bedroom, he moves on to the roof terrace where he does 40 push-ups and 40 box squats, before bedtime  at 11.30pm. This is exactly how tomorrow will pan out – and indeed, the next 850-plus days. Because after 32 years as a celebrated physicist at an American university, 69-year-old Prof Frampton, from Kidderminster,  is under house arrest at a friend’s Buenos Aires apartment after being found guilty of drug smuggling. Paul Frampton said being incarcerated was dehumanising: ' It was like being an animal in a cage'. After 280 days in prison with chain-smoking cellmates, he was permitted to live out his sentence under house arrest . The apartment is a far cry from the cell he shared with 79 hardened criminals, but it is still his prison. Yet Prof Frampton’s only crimes, he says, are loneliness and naivety. Thirteen months ago, he was seduced on an internet dating website by someone he believed was a beautiful Czech model. They planned to meet in Bolivia but when Frampton arrived, he was greeted by a man claiming to be the model’s friend. This friend said she had left for a modelling assignment in Brussels and that Frampton should follow her there, via Buenos Aires – taking with him a suitcase that belonged to her. In reality, the model was a happily married woman who knew nothing of the professor’s existence – and the online ‘lover’ was a drug trafficking gang who had filled the lining of the suitcase with bundles of cocaine concealed in gift wrap. Though Frampton pleaded innocent during a three-day hearing last month, it took three judges just one hour to find him guilty and sentence him to four years and eight months, of which he will serve two years four months. Denise Milani, a 36-year-old married woman born in the Czech Republic who now lives in Los Angeles. Until contacted by The Mail on Sunday after his arrest, she claims to have had no knowledge of Prof Frampton . After 280 days in custody in a prison with chain-smoking cellmates, he was permitted, because of a chronic lung condition, to live out the sentence under house arrest at the Buenos Aires apartment of an old friend from their days as Oxford University students. Defence lawyers are currently working on an appeal, which will be submitted this week. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Prof Frampton said: ‘I am still in a state of shock. I can’t believe I am a convicted felon. I am an innocent man. A physics professor. I am a scam victim. My only crime was being lonely. ‘I am so angry with myself, with what has happened. I feel so bad. ‘Prison was very dehumanising. It was like being an animal in a cage. Now, I’m confined to the flat and  my friend’s family have adopted me. They are my support group. ‘But even after 40 weeks, it has an air of surreality, to wake up and realise where you are and that you can’t just go out and walk around.’ His ordeal began in November 2011 when he struck up a friendship on a dating website with someone he believed was model Denise Milani, a former Miss Bikini World from the Czech Republic. After corresponding for 11 weeks, he was smitten and agreed to meet her in Bolivia where she said she was on a modelling assignment. Though Denise Milani does exist, she is a 36-year-old married woman born in the Czech Republic who now lives in Los Angeles. Until contacted by The Mail on Sunday after his arrest, she claims to have had no knowledge of Prof Frampton. Yet at the time Frampton was convinced the relationship was genuine. In January, he travelled from his North Carolina home to La Paz in Bolivia, where he was met by a man claiming to be Milani’s friend. Frampton claims that this friend told him Milani had left for another modelling job in Brussels and was waiting for him there. This friend also handed him the suitcase. Professor Frampton, pictured with his ex-wife Anne-Marie. Two days after his arrest, he was sent to Villa Devoto Prison, a Buenos Aires jail famed for riots in 1978 that left 62 dead . Desperate to meet his new ‘girlfriend’, Frampton set out on a journey from Bolivia to Brussels, via Ezeiza International Airport in Buenos Aires, where he was told he would be sent an e-ticket by Milani. Yet when it failed to appear after 44 hours, he tried to board a plane home to North Carolina – and  was arrested when security officials discovered four pounds of cocaine in a false bottom in the suitcase he had checked in. ‘I would like to warn people of the evils of internet dating,’ says Frampton, who did not speak to his ‘lover’ beforehand. ‘I would advise internet daters to have a telephone conversation with the other person, preferably with a video link. There are so many criminals out there. I never expected to be a scam victim.’ Two days after his arrest, he was sent to Villa Devoto Prison, a Buenos Aires jail famed for riots in 1978 that left 62 dead. ‘Creativity kept me going,’ says Prof Frampton. ‘Every day I went to the small university centre in the prison and worked on physics, which helped me maintain my sanity.’ Prof Frampton's case is complicated by 27 messages he sent to a phone he believed to belong to Miss Milani, pictured, implying he was carrying drugs . And despite now being placed on unpaid . leave by North Carolina University, he adds: ‘I have ideas for eight . research projects, distributed between particle phenomenology and . theoretical cosmology. And I am going to learn Spanish.’ Beneath . the stiff upper lip is a man in turmoil. Although he is now able to . concentrate on his research, he admits he has barely slept since his . conviction. Even if his appeal succeeds, it could take months for his sentence to be revoked. In their ruling, the judges said they believed the unanswered messages were signs of mutual understanding between Frampton and Milani . His case is complicated by a series of . text messages he sent to a phone he believed to belong to Milani, while . at Ezeiza airport. Bored and tired, he sent 27 messages implying he was . carrying drugs. ‘I wanted to string her along and sent . a series of text messages, some of which referred to “sniffer dogs” and . “coca”, and said, “This stuff is worth millions.” ‘These messages were purely to amuse her,’ he says. ‘I . had the bright idea, which I now bitterly regret, of mentioning drugs. Frustrated because I had not met her, I chose to amuse her with an . ill-choice of joking text messages. ‘I had no idea there were drugs in the bag – I thought it was hers.’ He added: ‘Real drug mules would never talk about drugs via text message or email.’ But in their ruling, the judges said they believed the unanswered messages were signs of mutual understanding between Frampton and Milani. Frampton’s defence team argue that CCTV showing long  periods when he left the suitcase unattended proves his innocence. Psychological reports conclude that Frampton suffers from some traits of Asperger’s syndrome as well as Narcissistic Personality Disorder, which impede him from distinguishing reality from fantasy. His solicitor Eduardo Oderigo Snr. told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Paul Frampton is a very special man and there is not enough information to condemn him. It is hard to believe his story, but the judges need to see things through his eyes. ‘They need to look at the big picture and not just focus on the drugs in a suitcase and text messages.’ Prof Frampton added: ‘My life has been in the brilliant world of theoretical physics, not the sordid world of South American drugs traffickers. I simply wasn’t equipped mentally to be suspicious of people. ‘I live in a world of the physics of the universe where colleagues are truthful. And as incredible and incredulous as it might sound, this is the truth.’","Physics professor from Kidderminster says he has barely slept since conviction in Buenos Aires .

"By . Tom Leonard . PUBLISHED: . 20:34 EST, 18 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:36 EST, 18 January 2013 . Scientology's star: Tom Cruise is seen at the opening of a new Church of Scientology in Madrid in 2004 . They grew him a wild flower meadow in the desert where he and Nicole Kidman could frolic hand-in-hand. They salute him and call him ‘sir’. And when he needed a new woman in his life, they ‘auditioned’ dozens of actresses for the role. The extraordinary lengths to which the Church of Scientology has allegedly gone to woo Tom Cruise are detailed in a controversial new book which contrasts his demi-god status in the organisation with the miserable existence of its rank-and-file devotees. To outsiders, it has always seemed odd that the squeaky-clean Hollywood superstar has lavished praise on the ‘church’ as a force for good in the world, when a growing number of ex-members have portrayed it as a ruthless and exploitative cult that rules its brainwashed flock with a rod of iron. Now a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning . American writer Lawrence Wright — published in the U.S. yesterday — has . painted a withering portrait of an organisation which has always seen . celebrity endorsement as essential to its mystique. What . better buffer against ridicule of a ‘religion’ based on sci-fi author . and founder L. Ron Hubbard’s claims of alien invaders inhabiting our . bodies than the approval of a few film stars, the book asks. In . Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood And The Prison Of Belief, Wright . claims that Scientology boss David Miscavige succeeded in cultivating . Cruise as a spiritual leader of his movement after he became Hollywood’s . biggest star with films such as Top Gun and Mission: Impossible. Cruise, . in turn, willingly became the church’s smiling public face, ploughing . millions of dollars into its work and even attempting to lobby foreign . leaders, including former PM Tony Blair, to advance its dubious cause . around the world. Love life: The book claims Scientology boss David Miscavige went to extreme lengths to keep Cruise and Nicole Kidman happy when the pair were married . Before 50-year-old Cruise, John Travolta was the church’s biggest star name. According to Wright, the Saturday Night Fever actor was terrified that if he broke with the church, it might use against him confessions he made about his sexuality during his Scientology spiritual counselling sessions, called ‘auditing’. At the height of Travolta’s fame in the late Seventies, church bosses were reportedly ‘desperately concerned their most valuable member would be revealed as gay’. Marty Rathbun — once Miscavige’s second-in-command but now a leading critic of Scientology — told Wright the church had worked hard to protect Travolta’s reputation and that there were many allegations that he claims the church helped to ‘make go away’. Allegations: Lawrence Wright's book on the Church of Scientology . The church yesterday dismissed Wright’s book as ‘an error-filled, unsubstantiated, bigoted, anti-Scientology book’, which relied on the accounts of a ‘handful of angry, bitter individuals’ who have left the church, adding that it contained more than 200 mistakes. Wright relates how a young Cruise was introduced to Scientology by his first wife, actress Mimi Rogers, in 1986. But Rogers’ parents were disaffected Scientologists and, the book claims, Miscavige was determined to keep his famous new recruit away from them. With Cruise smitten by Australian actress Nicole Kidman, then 21, Rathbun said he was sent to Rogers’ home with divorce papers and simply told her: ‘ “This is the right thing to do for Tom, because he is going to do lots of good for Scientology.” That was the end of Mimi Rogers.’ Miscavige’s determination to please Cruise and Kidman, whom he married in 1990, is said to have run to ludicrous lengths. Gold . Base is the church’s heavily fortified secret HQ in the California . desert, where some 800 members of Sea Org — Scientology’s quasi-military . ruling order — slave away for room, board and £15 a week. It has been . claimed that some haven’t left the base for ten years. But . it was here, inside the razor-wire fences that Miscavige built a . special ‘love bungalow’ where the couple stayed during their visits. A . rose garden was planted next to it and a tennis court built. When . Miscavige heard the couple fantasised about running through a field of . wild flowers, staff were ordered to plant a section of desert. The . meadow never took hold in the parched earth, and when a mudslide ruined . the bungalow, Wright claims that Miscavige was so furious he ordered . the entire base to work 16-hour days until it was restored to pristine . condition. While . everyone else lives in spartan conditions at Gold Base, Cruise would be . lavishly entertained in the Miscavige home, which boasts two chefs and . where even the lightbulbs are polished once a month. Not . for Cruise and other visiting celebrities the indignity of having to . salute Miscavige’s five beagles, as rank-and-file workers were ordered . to do, according to Going Clear. These . dogs, claims the book, wear blue vests and shoulder epaulettes denoting . they hold the rank of Sea Org Captain, thus out-ranking most human . staff. Gold Base: Scientology's desert base in California is believed to be home to some 800 members of Sea Org . Miscavige once . had the entire Gold Base staff line up at the gate and salute Cruise on . his arrival, says Wright. Nobody was allowed to speak to him unless . spoken to. The rule . was simple — keep the film star happy. As Wright wryly observes: . ‘Miscavige showed his understanding of how to cater to the sense of . entitlement that comes with great stardom.’ Former . Scientologists believe Miscavige was dazzled by Cruise and his . Hollywood lifestyle while the actor ‘fell under the spell’ of the short . but forceful Miscavige’s commanding personality. The church leader liked . to boast Cruise used him as the model for his gutsy naval officer hero . in A Few Good Men. 'Suspicious': Wright alleges that Miscavige feared Nicole Kidman was supplanting the church in Cruise's affections . But . Wright alleges that Miscavige — who became Cruise’s best friend — grew . deeply suspicious of Kidman, according to his deputy, Marty Rathbun. He . believed that not only was the Australian actress supplanting the church . in Cruise’s affections, encouraging him to neglect it, but that she was . a ‘gold digger’ who faked an interest in Scientology to please her . husband. If they convinced Cruise that Kidman was a ‘suppressive person’ — church code for a toxic personality — Cruise could be ‘peeled’ away . from her, Rathbun told Wright. When, . in 2001, Cruise and Kidman split up, Rathbun says Scientology staff . quietly worked to turn their two young adopted children against Kidman, . convincing them that she was a ‘sociopath’. The church and Miscavige have vehemently denied these claims several times in the past.After . their split, Cruise became more committed to Scientology. Whenever . Hollywood’s biggest star travelled abroad, he would lobby politicians . and diplomats to promote Scientology, says Wright. He is said to have repeatedly urged Bill Clinton to enlist Tony Blair’s help in getting the church charitable status in the UK. Rathbun . said he heard one phone call in which Clinton told Cruise he would be . better off contacting Cherie Blair as, being a lawyer, she would . ‘understand the details’. Perhaps . the oddest — and surely most embarrassing — claim in the book is that . of the church’s obsession with finding Cruise a mate. In 2007, after he . ended his three-year relationship with Penelope Cruz (regarded as too . independent-minded by church bosses, apparently) the star complained . that nobody had been able to find him a new girlfriend. A . grand hunt ensued as staff reportedly auditioned every young actress in . Scientology — about 100 in all. None were told why they were being . interviewed, but all were asked what they thought of Cruise. Split: The actor's three year romance with Spanish starlet Penelope Cruz ended in 2007 . An early candidate was Nazanin Boniadi, a strikingly beautiful and well-educated British-Iranian. According . to Wright, when Boniadi refused church demands to give up her . Scientologist boyfriend as part of an important ‘human rights’ project, . she was shown evidence suggesting he had cheated on her. After . undergoing extensive security checks, she was flown to New York where . she and her church handlers ran into Cruise, seemingly by accident. Lavish dates followed in Manhattan and at a Colorado mountain resort. Striking beauty: British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi . Boniadi . said she later moved in with him, but the relationship ended abruptly . when, during a dinner party, she couldn’t understand what the . fast-talking Miscavige was saying and several times asked him to repeat . himself. The next day, Cruise lost his temper with her for showing . disrespect to their leader. Wright . says that when Miss Boniadi told a friend about the affair, she was . punished by having to dig ditches and even scrub lavatories with a . toothbrush — a claim the church denies. Going . Clear alleges that the search for a new Mrs Cruise then went beyond . Scientologists — Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan and Scarlett Johansson were . all invited to audition for what they believed was a role in the . Mission: Impossible films when, in fact, they were being assessed as . future wives. Cruise, of course, eventually married actress Katie Holmes who helpfully had admitted to having a childhood crush on him. Wright . says several sources have confirmed Miss Boniadi’s experiences with . Cruise, although the star insists no church executive ever set him up . with girlfriends. By . the mid-2000s, Cruise was the most powerful figure in the church after . Miscavige, say ex-members. Miscavige ‘convinced Cruise that he and Tom . were two of only a handful of truly “big beings” on the planet,’ said . Marty Rathbun. He . added that Miscavige even told the actor that L. Ron Hubbard was relying . on them to make it to ‘Target 2’ — an unspecified planet far, far away . where they would meet up with Hubbard in the afterlife. Scientology . is going through a PR crisis from which critics insist it will never . recover. The church claims to have 8 million members worldwide, but a . survey suggested there are only 25,000 in the U.S. Last . year, Cruise had to contend with the humiliation of Holmes divorcing . him, and reportedly insisting she doesn’t want their daughter brought up . as a Scientologist. At . least the world’s most controversial church still has Cruise as a . figurehead. Whether that is a blessing or a liability remains to be . seen.",Claims emerged in controversial new book about the Church of Scientology by Pulitzer Prize-winning U.S. writer Lawrence Wright .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Created 1:08 PM on 3rd August 2011 . It's a radio station known for irreverent chat, where current affairs and topical discussion reign supreme. But Radio 5 Live took on a more otherworldly tone this morning when one of its own sports reporters claimed he had a close brush with a UFO. 'Freaked out' sports journalist Mike Sewell said he was left gobsmacked when he spotted a huge 'disc-shaped' aircraft hovering above the Hertfordshire countryside on his way to work in the early hours of the morning. Unidentified: Sports journalist Mike Sewell says he saw a disc-shaped craft hovering over a Hertfordshire village . Mr Sewell was driving from his home in the Midlands to catch an early morning flight from Stansted airport when he saw the UFO in the night sky over the village of Cottered, near Buntingford, he claimed. He called his employers at Radio 5 Live and his interview with presenter Nicky Campbell was broadcast to millions of listeners. He said: 'I was probably about 15 or 20 miles from Stansted at 4.15 in the morning and there was this big bright light in the sky descending towards the road. 'As it got closer it then banked to the left, and as it banked to the left and went across the countryside I could see underneath it. 'It wasn't an aeroplane, and it wasn't a helicopter. Certainly of a kind of - and I dread saying this - disc shape. It had several lights flashing all around it. Claims: The extraordinary revelations were broadcast on Nicky Campbell's show (pictured) 'Underneath there were at least two large panel lights, soft white lights, and then it just sat or circled a certain area above the field for a few moments. 'I was so gobsmacked, I was trying to negotiate the road, which was a small country lane. Eventually I dropped down and lost sight of it but certainly for two or three minutes I saw what, I think, was not a normal aeroplane.' The well-respected reporter, who was flying to Sweden for tonight's Champions' League qualifying game between Glasgow Rangers and Malmo, said a van driver in front of him also saw the UFO. He added: 'I'd love the person who was driving in front of me in what looked like a VW silver transporter to contact the police or yourselves [the radio station] because they saw it as well. 'I was wide awake and I'm of sound mind. I was completely freaked out by it. This was a long way from Stanstead airport -  at least 15 miles - and the aircraft was going westerly rather than easterly towards Stansted. 'It was not the shape of a normal aircraft it was a big disc, round-shaped craft and it didn't leave. 'I watched it for two or three minutes before I eventually lost sight of it. I decided to go back again through the village. It's a very quiet area and I've spoken to someone who knows it very well and they said there's no military installations in that area so I would be intrigued to hear if anybody else saw it.' UFO expert Timothy Good said Mr Sewell's sighting was 'absolutely fascinating' and was 'clearly not a conventional aircraft of any type'. During the interview on Radio 5 Live, which followed his sports report, he added: 'I'm most impressed, I wish I'd seen it myself. I would assume that a number of other people would have seen this object. 'It might be extra terrestrial, it might well be one of ours. Top secret aircraft and spacecraft have been flown by the U.S. military and by the British military for quite some time now. 'As Ben Rich said, who developed the stealth aircraft back in 1993 in the presence of two friends of mine: ""We now have the technology to go to the stars"". And that was back in 1993.' When Mr Good was asked to elaborate on where this technology came from, he replied: 'Alien crafts. The study of alien crafts that have been recovered and by liaising with actual aliens who have helped us develop this technology.'","'Disc-shaped' aircraft hovered over village in Hertfordshire .

U.S. bounty hunters should not be allowed to raise the wreck of one of Britain's greatest warships and take some of the millions of pounds of gold it contains, it has today been claimed. Leading archaeologists and descendants of the crew of HMS Victory, predecessor to Nelson's flagship, say that allowing it to be exploited for commercial gain would be a 'flagrant breach' of the military covenant and a betrayal of the more than 1,000 Royal Navy sailors who died. In 2008, the wreck was discovered by Odyssey Marine Exploration, a U.S. company, some 264 years after it sank in a storm off the Channel Islands. US bounty hunters should not be allowed to raise the wreck of the HMS Victory and take some of the millions of pounds of gold it contains, it has today been claimed . It is believed it could contain gold worth hundreds of millions of pounds and 100 bronze cannon. The Ministry of Defence has said recovery could go ahead under the 'auspices of a charity'. The Maritime Heritage Foundation, which was set up by Lord Lingfield, formerly Sir Robert Balchin a descendant of Admiral Sir John Balchen, the ship's commander, was founded for the purpose. It has submitted plans to the MoD and Department for Culture, Media and Sport and agreed a contract with Odyssey which would give the firm 80 per cent of the value of coins and bullion and 50 per cent of the value of cultural artefacts. The Government is expected to make an announcement soon on whether it will allow the proposals to go ahead. 'There is only one opportunity to gather . the unique evidence of our past from these 'time-capsules' of history . and this should not be squandered for short-term financial gain.' In a letter to the Daily Telegraph, Richard West, another descendant of Admiral Sir John Balchen, and Robert Yorke, chairman of the Joint Nautical Archaeology Policy Committee, said it 'represented the most inappropriate and distasteful kind of commercial exploitation.' They said that any finds raised from the ship would be sold on the antiquities market for private gain. They also said the Maritime Heritage Foundation had not got the relevant experience or discernible resources. The committee said: 'The JNAPC's position is that historic wrecks in international waters should not be salvaged or excavated for commercial gain. 'Only if a wreck is under severe threat, or there is a clear research objective, should excavation take place. Otherwise the wreck should be left in situ. Most of these wrecks lie in very deep water and excavation techniques at depth using remote operated vehicles (ROV's) are in their infancy. 'Salvage today will almost certainly lead to the unnecessary loss of irreplaceable historical information. There is only one opportunity to gather the unique evidence of our past from these 'time-capsules' of history and this should not be squandered for short-term financial gain.' Odyssey discovered the site nearly 100 km from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked on a reef near the Channel Islands . A cannon recovered from HMS Victory. It is believed it could contain gold worth hundreds of millions of pounds and 100 bronze cannon . HMS Victory was lost in 1744 under the command of Admiral Sir John Balchen. The direct predecessor and inspiration behind Nelson's flagship, Balchen's Victory was the mightiest and most technically advanced vessel of her age . Experts say that if Victory, which sank on duty in 1744, were a 20th century vessel, it would be protected by sovereign immunity. The vessel, predecessor of Nelson's famous flagship, went down in a storm off the Channel Islands in 1744, taking more than 1,000 soldiers to their deaths. Along with a bronze cannon collection, some believe the ship was carrying a large quantity of gold coins from Lisbon to Britain, which would now be worth a reported £500 million. The ship's location remained a mystery despite numerous searches, until Odyssey discovered the wreck in May 2008. The Florida-based firm found the site 330ft under the English Channel, nearly 65 miles from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked, near the Channel Islands. The Dutch financial publication Amsterdamsche Courant reported on November 18 1744, a month after the ship sank: 'People will have it that on board of The Victory was a sum of 400,000 pounds sterling that it had brought from Lisbon for our merchants.' It was also thought that large quantities of silver and gold coins would have been on board The Victory from enemy prize ships captured by Balchin, worth 120,000 pounds sterling at the time. The recovery of the ship would cost up to £25million. Last year during a debate on Victory, Lord Renfrew said that a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) convention said the excavation of wrecks should not be financed by selling the items recovered. The Cambridge University professor said to contravene it would be setting a terrible example. He added that there were 'major ethical issues' involved, and that the Government were giving a poor and ill informed lead internationally in their dealings with Britain's underwater heritage. Baroness Andrews, chairman of English Heritage, which sits on a committee to advise the MoD and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, said the charity was concerned about Odyssey's proposed plans to manage the site. She said: 'We do not believe that the proposals for the wreck are based on an adequate and authoritative assessment of its historical significance, nor a full understanding of the threats to and vulnerabilities of the site. 'We urge the Government to think hard about this, to recognise that our maritime heritage is an exceptional national asset, not an overseas commodity, and to act with resolve.' Because the wreck is in international waters, it is not protected, Lord Lingfield said. While he maintains that Odyssey is 'wholly reputable', it was at the centre of controversy after lifting 17 tons of silver coins from the wreck of a Spanish frigate sunk by the Navy in 1804 . It was ordered to return the cargo without compensation last year. A U.S. judge said the ship should have lain undisturbed.","In 2008, the wreck was discovered by Odyssey Marine Exploration, 264 years after it sank .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:35 EST, 6 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:15 EST, 6 March 2013 . A married insurance agent accused of helping a Zumba instructor use her fitness studio as a front for prostitution was convicted Wednesday in a case that set off a guessing game in a small Maine town over who was on her customer list. Mark Strong Sr. controlled, supervised and managed the prostitution business and watched the sex acts live via Skype from his office 100 miles away, prosecutors contend. The married businessman acknowledged having an affair with dance instructor Alexis Wright and helping her open the Kennebunk studio but contended he didn't profit from her prostitution. Guilty: Jurors have found Mark Strong (right) guilty of 12 counts of promoting prostitution and one of conspiracy . Wright is scheduled to stand trial in May, barring a settlement. Deputy District Attorney Justina McGettigan said the guilty verdicts vindicated law enforcement officials accused of putting too much time and money into the investigation. 'Prostitution is not legal in Maine. We don't promote prostitution. We don't want it in our communities,' she said. 'The Kennebunk Police Department did a fabulous job investigating this despite all of the negative comments that were thrown out that it was a poor use of resources. In fact, it was a good use of resources because it makes our communities safer.' Jurors deliberated for 4 1/2 hours before announcing that they had found Strong guilty of all 13 counts - 12 of promoting prostitution and one of conspiracy. Pending: Wright is awaiting trial. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges . Strong, 57, of Thomaston, showed little reaction as the verdicts were announced. His wife buried her head in their son's shoulder and quietly sobbed. Later, Strong said his family needs to heal. 'It's not easy obviously,' Strong told reporters outside the courthouse. 'It's going to take time.' Strong, who was released on personal recognizance, is due to be sentenced on March 19. Theoretically, he could be sentenced to up to 13 years in prison for the 13 misdemeanor counts but consecutive sentences are unlikely, especially since he had no criminal record, attorneys said. Defense lawyer Dan Lilley said he was disappointed by the verdict but is now focusing on sentencing and possible appeals. 'I never argue with a jury. It's a useless exercise. We're going to look over the options we have now,' he told a throng of reporters gathered outside the courthouse. He said he anticipated a sentence ranging from a fine to 'weeks and perhaps months incarceration.' Stash: Officers searched Wright's Pure Vida Zumba exercise studio in downtown Kennebunk, Maine, pictured . Business: Police found lubricants, an assortment of condoms and baby oil in Wright's home and studio . The scandal in Kennebunk, a village known more for its sea captains' homes and beaches than crime, attracted international attention in the fall after it was reported that Wright's ledgers indicated she had more than 150 clients and made $150,000 over 18 months. Authorities then sent the town abuzz with word that they would be charging each of the johns, leading residents to wonder who they were. Residents, though, soon grew weary of the media attention. Testimony and videos presented to jurors indicated Strong was familiar with operational details of Wright's activities, chatting via Skype before and after her appointments and watching the sexual encounters from his office in Thomaston. Before each tryst, Wright took time to make sure her video camera was hidden and pointed at the massage table where the encounters took place. The judge previously dismissed 46 invasion-of-privacy counts that stemmed from videotaping of prostitution clients without their knowledge. Strong's attorneys had claimed he was a smitten lover who wanted to help single mother Wright, pictured above . Even as lurid details emerged in the . courtroom, Strong's wife of 30 years and several other family members . remained seated several rows behind him. The . verdict in the delay-plagued trial came more than six weeks after the . start of jury selection, which was halted twice because of legal action . that went to the state supreme court, leaving potential jurors in limbo . for weeks. Jurors left without talking to reporters. One . thing that was missing from the trial was testimony from Wright's . accused clients. Eighteen of them were on the state's list of witnesses, . but none of them testified after attorneys stipulated that the . encounters took place. As . for Wright, her attorney and prosecutors will hold a settlement . conference next week, McGettigan said. Barring a settlement, Wright is . scheduled to stand trial in May on more than 100 counts that include . prostitution and tax violations. Sarah Churchill, Wright's lawyer, said the issues are different with her case. She declined to comment on settlement talks. Strong chatted with Wright via Skype before and after her appointments and watching the sexual encounters from his office 100 miles up the coast in Thomaston . Earlier in the trial police officer Audra Presby has testified that she had found an 'assortment of condoms', four bottles of baby oil, cameras, a planner and $1,000 cash at Wright's residence. Presby was assigned to the case in October 2011 . following a complaint of suspicious activity at Wright's Pura Vida Zumba . studio. While Presby . initially failed to make any discoveries of suspicious activity, she . carried out internet searches and came across a blog that caught her . attention. 'When I performed the online search, . not only did I find this site, Sensual Body Works by Lydia, I also found... online sex videos of this individual,' Presby said. Another . agent called the number listed on the blog and posed as a client to ask . whether an hour massage would get him sex. On the tape, which was . played in the court, she responds: 'OK.' Presby testified she had also seized several . computer hard drives, a laptop, checkbooks and personal lubricants from Wright's businesses, home and vehicle during a February 2012 search. Presby also testified that she linked Strong to the case after seeing a sex . video of him and Wright and matching his face and voice to the video appearances. Strong . watched sexual encounters between Wright and her clients through a live computer webcam and . spoke with Wright when the men were out of the . room. 'I remember keeping the logs of the hours [spent watching sexually . explicit evidence],' Presby said. 'I know at one point I was well over 80 hours, and by the . end, I was closer to 120 hours.' Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, is slated to stand trial in May. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges . Jurors were shown a video of Wright having sex with a 61-year-old man on . a massage table in exchange for $250, while Strong watched . from his home computer via Skype. The damning evidence, recorded by . Wright herself on a camera hidden in a nest of lingerie, shows her . negotiating a fee and then collecting a pile of cash after she finishes. Prosecutors . argued that Strong was listening in and watching live via Skype during . the entire encounter and later discussed booking other johns for Wright - . pushing her to sleep with three clients in one day instead of two. In between clients, she discussed her . schedule of clients with a man watching through the video . camera. Prosecutors say that man is Strong. 'I'd like to schedule only two one-hour appointments tomorrow instead of 45,' Wright says, talking to the camera. 'Nice to get three in somehow,' the man's voice says. When Wright says that she has 'school' the next day, the man suggests she 'fit three in today.' Wright says that would be 'pushing it.' The man's voice later asks which clients he should try to book for her. The time stamp on the 36-minute video . shown the jurors, which was seized from Wright's home, corresponds with . the time on 45 Skype video screen shots that were downloaded from Strong's computer, an investigator testified. In other videos, the pair discuss rates and sexual services that Wright offered.","Mark Strong, 57, has been found guilty of 12 counts of promoting prostitution and .

A riot squad officer accused of killing Ian Tomlinson was outwitted by a protester in front of a jeering crowd just minutes before he hit the newspaper vendor, a court heard today. Constable Simon Harwood, 45, tried to arrest a man dressed in black who he saw writing 'all cops are b******s' on the side of a police vehicle during the G20 protests in the City of London in April 2009. But the demonstrator managed to wriggle free, leaving Harwood holding his jacket. Denied: Pc Harwood, pictured arriving at court today with his wife Helen, has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter . Today Constable Andrew Hayes, who was driving a police carrier that day, told Southwark Crown Court Harwood was 'almost in a tug of war' with the man. He said protesters turned hostile as soon as Harwood tried to make the arrest in Cornhill. 'There was jeering going on and I felt at that point the crowd was chasing PC Harwood down the street. The court was shown film footage of Ian Tomlinson's journey that day using video from various CCTV cameras across London up to the moment he walks past PC Simon Harwood - who is seen primed in a strike position behind him . Starting to fall: PC Harwood is accused of hitting Mr Tomlinson with a 'forceful baton strike' from behind . 'Since he had taken hold of the person in black it had become more hostile and was directed towards PC Harwood. 'The gentleman that he had hold of wiggled out of his jacket, and left PC Harwood holding the jacket.' Jurors were played film footage of the man being marched past PC Hayes’ carrier, and colliding with the driver’s door to jeers from the crowd. PC Hayes said: 'I’ve gone to get out, opened the driver’s door and something collided with the driver’s door. As Mr Tomlinson is helped to his feet, PC Harwood is no longer visible on the CCTV footage . 'I could see it was PC Harwood and the person in the black.' Around 15 minutes later Harwood, from Carshalton in Surrey, encountered Mr Tomlinson near the Royal Exchange Buildings, hit him with his baton and pushed him to the ground . Mr Tomlinson, 47, walked 70 metres before collapsing, and died in hospital under an hour later. Harwood denies manslaughter and maintains that he used reasonable force in the circumstances. In a previous statement, PC Hayes said the crowd were aiming kicks and punches at Harwood as he attempted to make the arrest. Julia Tomlinson and her son Paul King arrive at Southwark Crown Court today . Today a film clip was played showing one man apparently trying to trip him over as he struggled to keep hold of the protester. PC Hayes said he thought hundreds of members of the crowd were chasing Harwood. Earlier the court heard from witnesses who saw Mr Tomlinson as he blocked a police van in Lombard Street shortly after 7pm. Passer-by James Stone said he looked 'gaunt with glazed eyes' and was 'very slow to react', looking 'dazed and confused' when police officers told him to move on. He said he thought 'boy, does he look wasted', and that he was surprised to see Mr Tomlinson lose his balance when gently pushed by an officer. Constable Dean Cocks, who moved Mr Tomlinson out of the path of the police vehicle on to the pavement, said 'it was a low-level use of force'. PC Cocks said: 'I was more than happy that the level of force that I had used was reasonable and necessary given the circumstances. 'There might have been a bit of resistance but nothing that you wouldn’t expect from someone who was drunk. 'He was drunk, he was making a nuisance of himself and he was obstructing police in the course of their duty.' Constable Neil Finnis told jurors Mr Tomlinson deliberately sat on the front of the police van as he refused to get out of the way. Later, Constable Andrew Brown turned Mr Tomlinson away from a cordon in King William Street that blocked his route home to Smithfield. In a statement read to the court because PC Brown has since died, he said: 'The reality of the situation escaped him. I told him that he could not go past me. He stared at me, not in confrontation or disbelief but in incomprehension.'

The dead body of Osama bin Laden was positively identified by a child who was in the room with him when he died, according to a former U.S. Navy SEAL's account of his assassination. In his explosive book about the operation, titled No Easy Day, 36-year-old Matt Bissonnette - writing under the pseudonym Mark Owen - describes the moment his team discovered the terrorist leader was dead. Bin Laden was shot before the team reached the room he was hiding out in - taken out by a point man as he peered through a doorway  - but the SEALS couldn't get any of the witnesses to identify the 'most wanted man in the world', until they grilled a young girl who had witnessed the killing. Speaking out: Former Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette appeared on US TV show 60 Minutes this week to discuss his book. CBS said they disguised his appearance for his safety . Commando: A photo purported to be of Matt Bissonnette was published by Business Insider on Thursday . In No Easy Day, Bissonnette - who retired last summer - claims he was part of the team that stormed bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan in May 2011. He described how the the Navy SEALS killed bin Laden's son . Khalid as they made their way through the compound towards the . terrorist leader's private quarters on the third floor. Before revealing the moment a teammate . opened fire on a man who had peered through a doorway as they made . their way up a flight of stairs. He wrote: 'We were less than five steps from getting to the top when I heard suppressed shots. BOP. BOP. 'The . point man had seen a man peeking out of the door on the right side of . the hallway about ten feet in front of him. The man disappeared into the . dark room.' Target: A member of Seal Team Six shot and killed Osama bin Laden during the elite squad's daring raid of his compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan . Watching: In this undated image from video seized from bin Laden's compound, the Al-Qaeda chief watches a TV programme showing an image of President Obama . Cover: No Easy Day is scheduled for release on September 4 . Bissonnette alleges he was the second man to step inside the room and find a man lying on the ground, surrounded by two hysterical women - later revealed to be two of his wives. Three children, likely to have been bin Laden's own offspring, were cowering in the corner. He wrote: 'He was wearing a white sleeveless T-shirt, loose tan pants and a tan tunic.The point man's shots had entered the right side of his head. Blood and brains spilled out of the side of his skull. In his death throes he was still twitching and convulsing.' Bissonnette and his teammate, named 'Tom' in the book, then fired a series of rounds into his chest to ensure he was dead. Examining the body, the pair became convinced they had killed Bin Laden. Bissonnette wrote: 'The man's face was mangled from from at least one bullet one and covered in blood. his chest was torn up. 'I started to wipe blood away from his face using a blanket from the bed. With each swipe, the face became more familiar. 'It was strange to see such an . infamous face up close. Lying in front of me was the reason we had been . fighting for the last decade.' As they photographed and took DNA . samples, an Arabic speaking SEAL, called 'Will' in the book, began . interrogating the women, one of whom was bin Laden's fifth wife Amal . al-Fatah. But they just listed off a series of aliases, refusing to name bin Laden - so 'Will' turned to the children. Bissonnette wrote: '(Will) went . over to the kids who were outside on the balcony. (He) knelt down and . asked one of the girls, 'Who is the man?' The girl didn't know to lie. 'Osama bin Laden.' Will smiled. 'Are you sure that is Osama bin Laden?' 'Yes,' the girl said. Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the Situation Room of the White House . Armed with confirmation, the Seals relayed the 'Geronimo' message to their superior officers and to President Obama that the target had been killed.

The Houston alley cat who gained national renown for dropping twenty per cent of his total body weight through rigorous dieting in little more than a year will undergo surgery next week for cancer. A veterinarian at the animal hospital where Tiny Tim, the Texas city's favorite tubby tabby, permanently resides announced the potentially-fatal illness on the cat's Facebook page, 'Tiny Tim at Spah,' earlier in the week. 'Tiny Tim has cancer,' Dr. Alice Frei wrote. 'There is no radiation or chemotherapy for such an aggressive tumor.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Back on track: Tiny Tim, who weighed 35 lbs when he was found last Christmas, has now lost eight lbs. His diet was momentarily interrupted when he took to secret midnight snacking . Frei then followed that initial report by writing in a subsequent post on Friday around 3 pm that vets had pronounced the . cat's chest clear of cancer, and were soon to conduct a biopsy on the . tumor. Should the cancer had spread to the area, the prognosis for Tiny Tim would reportedly have been terminal. 'This . means Tiny Tim comes home today,' Frei wrote in a Friday post. 'It also . means more waiting. More moments of hope, heart racing fear and . sleepless nights. I must remind myself that from Tiny Tim’s perspective . it was a day without the usual food and fun.' Tiny . Tim boards at the Southside Place Animal Hospital in Houston, which . reportedly accepted him as a permanent resident around Christmas 2011 . after local animal rescue officials found him as a stray. At . the time, Tiny Tim tipped the scales at a staggering 35.2 pounds, or . about 22 pounds more than a healthy tabby. The feline was reportedly . otherwise okay. Mega moggy: Tiny is pictured earlier this year when he weighed 33.9 lbs and could barely walk . Fat cat: He was found in Houston last year and shelter staff were unable to track down his owner . The . curvaceous cat has since dropped about seven pounds through a year of . dieting that reportedly allows him only a precise 307 calories per day. 'He . has been on a very, very regimented diet -- measured meal plans, the . whole works, and he is at 28.6 pounds,' SPAH manager Debbie Green told . ABCNews.com in a recent interview. 'He . weighs in twice a week, and he gets meals measured in little bags . throughout the whole week, so we know exactly what he's eating.' 'Tiny Tim has cancer. There is no radiation or chemotherapy for such an aggressive tumor' Vets at SPAH noticed swelling on Tiny Tim's elbow on Wednesday, and performed a pathology. The . cat was then shuttled to Texas A&M School of Veterinary Medicine, . where vets confirmed the cancer, and 'said (it) was so rapidly growing . that they could not define the cell of origin.' 'If . Tiny Tim's CAT scan does not show [the] tumor has invaded his chest, we . have decided that the only course of treatment is to have the leg . amputated,' Frei previously wrote on Facebook. 'If the tumor has spread . to his chest his treatment options are basically zero.' Pawsitive progress: Tiny Tim is pictured left on the scales at 31.9 lbs and right at 29.9 lbs . Home: He is now a permanent resident at the clinic, where staff monitor his meals and encourage him to walk as much as possible by placing him at different spots around the center . Tiny . Tim's saga took an unusual, yet endearing, turn in late December, when . flummoxed SPAH vets announced to interested media they could not crack . the 30-pound plateau during Tiny Tim's weigh-in's. The . staff later discovered the wily tabby was surreptitiously snacking on . dog food during the wee hours of the morning - and only during those . hours - by removing food from a hole he had fashioned in the bag of . kibble. 'I'll . frequently go in there and lay down right beside him, because he can't . jump in your lap. He looks at you with such love and . devotion' The tabby ironically boards in the animal hospital's pantry, according to ABC News, because he requires extra space and reportedly perfers solitude and quiet. After . he was found on the street, Tiny Tim was first taken to BARC Animal . Shelter & Adoptions where volunteers gave him his nickname and . decided to take on his recovery. One . of the volunteers at BARC, Tim Hebert, took him to the Southside Place . clinic and, after staff were unable to find his previous owner, he . became a permanent resident at the center. 'Of course now we've all fallen in love with him,' Reyna added. Hebert said he too is still attached to the cat and goes back to the clinic to visit him.

Canned: The BBC faces further questions over why a 10-minute Newsnight film looking into allegations of child sex abuse by Jimmy Savile (above) was dropped last December . A leaked email has cast doubt on the BBC's reason for cancelling a Newsnight investigation into the allegations of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile. The corporation has previously insisted that it decided not to proceed with the Newsnight film for 'editorial reasons' because the abuse story 'could not be substantiated'. But an internal email discussing the investigation into the late DJ suggests that the show was scrapped because of concerns it would clash with the TV channel's planned Christmas tributes to the star. The email dated on December 7, published by The Times today, reveals the investigation into abuse by Savile was so well advanced by then that the . press office was preparing 'lines to take' to respond to questions after . its planned broadcast. The email, sent from a press officer to Newsnight editor Peter Rippon and other staff, shows that the BBC was aware of . the risk that the report would raise questions about why it had failed . to expose Savile as a paedophile while he was alive. The press officer wrote that 'we may . well need to do a bit of managing around this' and that 'we should bear . in mind how BBC complaints team respond'. It also contradicts claims by the BBC that the film focused on  an alleged failure by police to investigate Savile properly and that Newsnight journalists were in fact 'focusing on allegations of abuse'. Rippon has previously claimed that the . story his journalists had been pursuing had been 'weakened from a . Newsnight perspective' because they had been unable to establish any 'institutional failure' by the police or the Crown Prosecution Service. Leaked: This email from publicist Helen Deller has cast doubt on the reasons the BBC has previously stated for dropping the Newsnight film on Savile . Investigation: Scotland Yard is now investigating the Jimmy Savile abuse case involving dozens of potential victims . Rob Wilson, the Conservative MP for Reading East, who obtained the email, said: 'Newsnight editor Peter Rippon and the BBC have sought to portray that the axed Newsnight report was not an expose of Savile, but was focused on the reasons the police and the CPS dropped their investigation. 'This leaked email and the evidence from internal BBC sources casts doubt on the carefully crafted version of events posted in Peter Rippon's blog on October 2. 'We need a full explanation of why the focus of the Newsnight expose of Jimmy Savile was abruptly changed at the last minute.' Responding to the leaked email, the BBC spokesman said: 'This ridiculous story in no way casts doubt on what the BBC has previously said on this. 'It is simply an exchange between a junior press officer and the Newsnight producer asking for further information about the Jimmy Savile investigation.' Cover-up? Newsnight, presented by Jeremy Paxman (above), spiked the film despite journalists interviewing 10 alleged victims and witnesses and believing they had enough information to broadcast the story . Apology: The director-general of the BBC George Entwistle has previously issued a 'profound and heartfelt apology' to Jimmy Savile's victims . She added that the email would be passed to the inquiry into whether there were any failings in the way the Newsnight report was handled. Ex-Sky News executive Nick Pollard is to lead the BBC's independent review into the matter while former High Court judge Dame Janet Smith will lead a second examination into the 'culture and practices of the BBC' during the years Savile worked there. On the defence: Newsnight editor Peter Rippon (above) said the current affairs show dropped the story because it 'had not established any institutional failure' on behalf of the police or Crown Prosecution Service . The disclosures about Savile's private life were made in an ITV documentary a fortnight ago. Around 60 people have now come forward to say they were a victim of the veteran DJ, TV presenter and charity campaigner. Police believe the disgraced star, who died a year ago, may have been abusing victims for decades. The BBC and other bodies could be sued by victims if it can be shown they were negligent in allowing Savile to prey on his young victims. A Department of Health investigation will also be conducted into Savile's conduct during his charity work at three hospitals - Stoke Mandeville, Broadmoor and Leeds General Infirmary.Labour has called for an independent inquiry as the fall-out from the revelations continues. BBC director general George Entwistle and former corporation stalwart Esther Rantzen have become involved as questions are asked about who knew of the rumours about Savile, what and when they heard about them, and whether enough was done to stop him. But a spokeswoman for the BBC dismissed . the email as 'simply an exchange between a junior press officer and the .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . PUBLISHED: . 10:34 EST, 11 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:06 EST, 12 March 2013 . Joanne Thompson, a senior staff nurse in the special care baby unit of the hospital, is accused of allowing a more junior nurse to administer the incorrect dose . Premature twins born at the scandal-hit Stafford Hospital died after receiving ten times the recommended dose of morphine, a disciplinary hearing has been told. Alfie and Harry McQuillan, who died on November 1 2010, were given an 'excessive' dose of morphine hours after their birth. The babies, who were born at 27 weeks, received 600 and 850 microgrammes (mcg) of morphine respectively when they should have been given between 50 and 100 mcg, a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing was told. Joanne Thompson, a senior staff nurse in the special care baby unit of the hospital, is accused of allowing a more junior nurse, Lisa Lucas, prepare and administer the drug to the twins with the help of a junior doctor. This is against hospital protocol which states this should be carried out by two registered nurses. Hayley Amos, a neo natal senior staff nurse at the hospital at the time, said she had reported for duty on the 7am shift on October 30 2010 after the overdose had been administered. Speaking about the reaction of the two nurses after the error had been discovered, she said: 'Joanne went very quiet at this point and was visibly shocked. Lisa was hysterical and kept saying: ""Oh my God, what if I have killed these babies?"" and she was crying and shaking. 'I did my best to calm and reassure Lisa by saying, ‘look at them Lisa, they are fine, now calm down’. I don’t recall Joanne saying anything. I sent them to the staff room to calm down.' The two nurses were told to complete Serious Incidents Forms by senior mangers at the Stafford NHS Trust and told not take part in any clinical care of the twins, Ms Amos said. She continued: 'Lisa and Jo completed their forms in a consulting room. 'I do not know what discussions were had or what went on between them.' But she added: 'It seems unfair that only Lisa has been held accountable for this drug error. 'Lisa is a very compassionate nurse who normally provides great care to babies on the unit. 'I do not know what went wrong that day. But you cannot say that Lisa is entirely responsible. 'As the senior nurse, Joanne should have ensured that the hospital's procedure was adhered to and that instruction was given to the junior nurse. 'A controlled drug error had taken place and Joanne should take some responsibility.' Despite being the senior nurse on duty at the time of the deaths, Ms Thompson was back on duty two days later on November 2nd, before an investigation had began while Miss Lucas remained suspended. Mrs . Thompson denies a series of charges including failing to take the . clinical lead of nursing care when required in relation to the . administration of the morphine to the babies. The twins' mother, Ami Dean, was rushed to Stafford Hospital in the early hours of October 30th, 2010, after she began to bleed. Alfie and Harry McQuillan died at Stafford Hospital (pictured) two days after being given an 'excessive' dose of morphine hours after their birth in October 2010 . Despite being born prematurely, the . identical twins had been in a 'good' condition during the first few . hours of their lives, an inquest into their deaths in 2012 heard. But it was decided to give the twins . morphine to stabilise them before they were transferred to the maternity . unit at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire where the twins . died on November 1st. The Nursing and Midwifery Council . (NMC) heard today how an error in administration led to the babies . having two doses of morphine administered at the same time. Miss Thompson is accused of not following hospital protocol by allowing a junior doctor to be involved in the administration of medication. Aj Hall, for the NMC, said: 'On the hospital protocols it clearly states that medication administration should be carried out by two registered nurses. It is well known doctors do not get involved in administrating drugs as this is done by nursing staff. 'Mrs Thompson should have ensured that this policy was complied with. The junior doctor had very limited experience and should not have been involved in administering the drugs. 'Mrs Thompson would have been well aware of this.' She added: 'It is vital she take responsibility for this.' Thompson is also accused of not keeping adequate records by scribbling out her signature on the morphine prescription charts without explanation, the court heard. Miss Hall added: 'She scribbled out her signature on the chart but never explained why she did this.' Shoosmiths - the law firm representing the twins’ parents - said last May that South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh had described the babies’ treatment after birth as 'suboptimal', adding that 'there were failings in the care the twins received'. A spokesman for the company said the coroner, who recorded a narrative verdict at Cannock Coroner’s Court, said the boys died from complications of extreme prematurity and that morphine was 'likely to have played a role'. The hearing comes after the Francis inquiry into failings at Stafford Hospital where it is estimated there were between 400 and 1,200 excess deaths between 2005 and 2009. The hearing continues.","Alfie and Harry McQuillan were born at 27 weeks in October 2010 .

The 19-year-old singer posted a series of messages to the social networking site speaking out about his partying, relationships and his religion. Justin denied allegations of his recent bad behaviour and said that he didn't have to answer to anyone and wrote: 'im only judged by one power, and i serve him.' (sic) Religious: Justin Bieber has gone on an angry Twitter tirade slamming his critics and said he is only judged by God. He later went out in London wearing his bizarre gas mask . After he had voiced his opinions to his 35million followers Bieber headed out on the town in London wearing his bizarre gas mask. The singer was seen heading to Mr Chows restaurant in the unusual head piece and he had his cream jumper pulled up around his face. The singer, who was two hours late for his debut concert at the 02 arena, started his rant with the message: 'rumors rumors and more rumors. nothing more nothing less. might talk about them 1 day. rt now im just gonna be positive. cant bring me down'. (sic) Angry rant: The 19-year-old posted a series of messages to the social networking site slamming reports about his bad behaviour . He added: 'We know the truth as long as . my family, friends, and fans r with me u can say whatever. we are all . equal in God's eyes & we have a responsibility to each other. (sic) Justin also made reference to Ella-Paige Roberts Clarke, who he has been spending considerable amounts of time with during his stay in the UK. He said: 'Any girl i stand next to is my girl or that i dont care, or that i dont feel, or that a 19 year old going to a club in europe is wild.'(sic) Someone looks a bit silly don't they? Justin emerged from his car and ran into the restaurant ducking down and flanked by his bodyguards on Wednesday night . What does he look like: The revolving door proved tricky for Justin to negotiate given his limited vision from the gas mask . While he played down his partying just hours later the singer headed to 45 Park Lane to continue his evening after a meal at Mr Chows. Justin's rant comes after claims that the reason for Justin's tardiness on Monday was because he threw a 'massive tantrum'. According to backstage sources Justin was . in a foul mood after waking up late because of a night out and the . 'stroppy youngster locked himself in his dressing room to play computer . games'. Despite . being accused of coming onstage two hours after he was billed to, with . hundreds of upset teenagers leaving before getting the chance to see . their idol, Justin said he was only 40 minutes late on Monday - blaming . technical difficulties and saying the gig was 'great'. Operation hide: There were several security men on had to help Bieber try and go unnoticed - his efforts didn't work . We know you're under there: Justin made sure none of his head was visible thanks to his mask, his jumper and a baseball cap . Gamer: Justin Bieber was apparently two hours late to his show on Monday because he was playing video games and woke up late . One O2 worker, who did not want to be named, told The Sun: 'He was arguing with members of his management, his family. It was a really uncomfortable atmosphere. His attitude was, ""I’m the star and I can do what I want""'. Another worker, Ellie Grace, said: 'I hope I never have to experience so many upset children and disappointed fans again.' Speaking to Heat magazine, an insider said the 19-year old refused to go onstage before showering, despite desperate pleas from his management to perform. Diva: A source close to the star told Heat magazine that the Canadian threw a tantrum before the Monday night show at the O2 . Tardy: Despite fans complaining, Bieber still maintains he was only 40 minutes late to stage . Curious: Wearing two expensive watches it's a wonder how Justin couldn't see he was late to his own concert . Another backstage source added: 'His . lateness was because he didn’t get out of bed until late and sat in his . dressing room playing games - even though his door was being knocked.' 'He then threw a strop as he said he wanted a shower first, despite already being late.' It is thought Justin arrived at the O2 arena at 3pm 'to do some meet and greets' but he . was suffering after a ' heavy night at his hotel. But the great audience at the O2 weren't the only ones to be disappointed. A . 15-year old fan - who did not want to be named for fear of backlash . from the Belieber community - was 'blanked' by her musical hero even . though she had won a competition to meet him before the show. The unhappy girl told Heat that she and her friends, waited for three hours to see Justin. However, when their idol finally arrived, they say he spent 'less than ten seconds' with him. She also claims the singer declined to give her a hug, ironically telling his fan 'I don't have time.' A source close to Justin said: 'There was no competition winner that we knew or approved of.' 'If it was a radio contest winner who got a meet and greet, they got the same amount of time as everyone else and exactly what was promised.' The rest of the accounts are 'wildly exaggerated or just untrue.' Party doesn't stop! After his show, Justin heads out for another 'good time' in London . Even an O2 staff member witnessed . Justin's alleged diva-like behaviour: . 'He was arguing with members of . his management, his family. It was a really uncomfortable atmosphere. His attitude was, ""I’m the star and I can do what I want"".' Despite . a wealth of attendees confirming his two hour delay to stage, the . Canadian star still maintains he only kept his fans waiting for 40 . minutes. Still popular: Justin Bieber was presented with an official Wembley Way . Stone this week after playing the stadium last year, causing his fans to record . the loudest scream during the Capital FM Summertime Ball . 'Last night i was scheduled after 3 opening acts to go on stage at 935 . not 830 but because of some technical issues i got on at 10:10..so...(sic)' the singer tweeted. Digital Spy also reported that the star is being asked to pay a £300,000 fine to Greenwich Council for causing the gig to run past the 11pm closing time. However, a Royal Borough of Greenwich spokesperson said: '[We] have not taken any action against the owners of The O2 in relation to Justin Bieber’s recent performance, as no breach of our licensing conditions took place.'

Attacked: Clare Laudy says she is now scared to go running at night after a fox jumped out and bit her while she was out jogging last month . A terrified jogger has told how she fought off a fox that sank its teeth into her leg. Clare Laudy, 17, says she's now scared to go running at night, after the fox leapt out of the darkness and bit her as she ran in Epsom, Surrey, last month. She spoke out after the shocking fox attack on month-old Denny Dolan, 15 miles away in Bromley, south east London. Miss Laudy, said she was jogging down the road at 8pm on the evening of January 10, in the dark when a fox struck. She said: 'Out of nowhere this fox leapt out at me and it was biting my leg. 'I shouted at the fox and it let go but did not run away. I followed the advice of a game ranger in Yosemite National Park on how to deal with bears and I made myself as large as possible and shouted loudly. It kept trying to chase me and I had to shout to make it go away.' It tore at her leggings and scratched her leg. Miss Laudy, a pupil at City of London Freeman's School, in Ashtead Park, said she ran home in panic and found a large hole torn in her leggings. She said: 'I was terrified because that had never happened to anyone I knew. 'I was really shaken up and I'm still really terrified of foxes. If it's dark and I'm walking down roads I get really scared.' Miss Laudy has gone on LBC radio to back the call for a fox cull, with London Mayor Boris Johnson describing the baby attack as a 'wake-up call'. She said: 'I think they definitely should be culled. Things like this are happening more often. I think it's getting out of hand. Sometimes they run away but a lot of times they are not scared of humans.' She believes people should be made more aware of the problem so they do not leave food out for them in the garden. A member of her family rang the council yesterday but was informed that it does not offer pest control in relation to foxes. Scroll down for video . Ripped: Miss Laudy found the holes torn in her leggings when she got home following the attack . Chased: The teenager said she used advice from a game ranger on how to deal with bears to try and scare the fox away . A council spokesman said: 'It is most unusual for someone to be approached by a fox. The council do receive occasional calls about fox nuisance but this tends to be about noise and bin raiding.' In a poll on epsomguardian.co.uk, 71 per cent of respondents on Tuesday said they were in favour of a cull by compared to 43 per cent across south London. When a similar poll was run a year ago, following the suspected killing of three cats by foxes in Ewell Court, just 54 per cent of local residents favoured a cull. 'Wake-up call': There have been calls for a fox cull after Baby Denny Dolan (left) had his finger bitten off by one of the animals in an attack last week . Local councillor Dave Mayall said there was a lot of emotion around foxes but evidence showed culling did not work because the population bounces back. He said: 'If you kill one fox you replace it with two.' When asked about recent attacks, he said he had never heard of a fox attacking an adult before and described the attack on the month-old baby as tragic. He said: 'It's normally a very sensitive issue and, as tragic as the incident was, these types of incidents are very rare.' 'Common sense and caution': A wildlife charity has described calls for a fox cull as a 'massive overreaction' Simon Cowell, founder of Leatherhead-based charity Wildlife Aid Foundation, said urban foxes were becoming more humanised than they should because people leave out food. But Mr Cowell spoke out against public hysteria and demonisation of foxes in the wake of what he said was sensationalised reporting of individual attacks. He said: 'Many people have been calling for foxes to be culled. I think this is a massive overreaction. What we need is a measure of common sense and caution.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:05 EST, 9 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:05 EST, 9 March 2013 . A Vermont newspaper accused of being racist after it published a poster with the words 'fry Rice' written in an oriental-style typeface claims the slogan was just a play on words and wasn't meant to offend. The Caledonian Record in St Johnsbury sparked outrage after it printed the back-page poster on Thursday to support local high school St Johnsbury Academy against Rice Memorial High School in a state championship basketball game. But the newspaper published an editorial today defending the decision, claiming the words did not constitute racism. Offensive: The Caledonian Record in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, has been criticized for the poster, pictured . 'We sought a simple play on words in support of an extraordinary group of local student athletes. Indulging our critics for a moment, the outcry reminds us that racial and ethnic stereotypes can offend - regardless of intent,' the editorial, presumably written by publisher Todd Smith, said. It acknowledged that the chosen font, 'evoked a particular ethnic cuisine' but did not constitute a racist slur. 'We don't concede, however, that the use of imagery with any racial, ethnic or religious inference is to inherently debase that race/ethnicity/religion,' the newspaper said. 'A fair accusation of racism would at least pre-require the reference to actually be demeaning or degrading,' the editorial said. 'Simply invoking ethnic customs (food, dress, design) doesn't do that, nor does it suggest any kind of characteristic about the culture, its people or a history of oppression by the majority.' But the editorial missed the point, said the president of the Asian American Journalists Association, who had criticized the poster after it was published. Support: The poster used a print type associated with Chinese calligraphy for the words 'fry Rice' to urge a local school to beat its opponent Rice Memorial High School, pictured, in a state basketball game . 'I'm not criticizing the Caledonian Record for rooting for their home team,' said Paul Cheung, the association's president. While Cheung does not believe the newspaper's intention was to be racist, it showed 'a lapse of judgment and poor taste.' 'It evoked a racial undertone and a negative stereotype,' said Cheung, who is also interactive and graphics editor for The Associated Press. Cheung's original letter to the publisher of the Caledonian Record on Friday said that the slogan by itself might be considered clever, but was offensive when written in that particular typeface. 'It became offensive when published in a typeface mimicking Chinese calligraphy,' wrote Cheung. 'We'll assume that your use of that typeface was not meant to offend. But we'll also assume that if that is the case, the Caledonian Record will publicly acknowledge its lapses in taste and judgment,' he said in the letter. St. Johnsbury Academy's high school basketball team played Rice Memorial, of South Burlington, for the championship Thursday. Rice Memorial won 48-40 in overtime. School: The top of the page read: 'Go ""Toppers,""' referring to the nickname of St Johnsbury Academy's high school, pictured . The newspaper ran the poster on the . back page of Thursday front section. The top of the page read: 'Go . ""Toppers,""' referring to the school's Hilltoppers nickname. Across the bottom of the page were the words 'fry Rice' in the style meant to resemble Chinese calligraphy. St. Johnsbury Academy, a private school, serves local students and also has . boarding students from across the world, including Asia. Academy . Headmaster Tom Lovett said Friday the school had nothing to do with the . poster, its design or its publication. 'We . appreciate the Caledonian-Record's support of our teams, and we know . for a fact that its intention was to support our boys in their . championship run by using a clever play on the name of our opponent,' Lovett said. He said none of the school's Asian students were offended by the poster. 'Overall, our students often see such things as a way to celebrate their culture, not demean it. And in this case, we chose to follow our students' lead and look at the Caledonian's intent, not taking offense where none was intended,' Lovett said. Once Academy officials saw the posters at the game, they did their best to remove them from the cheering section, he said.","The Caledonian Record in St Johnsbury published a poster using an oriental-looking typeface for the words 'Fry Rice'

Did the LPGA Tour rookie faint? Scream for an ambulance? Cry hysterically? No. While the panicked locals rushed around, Holmqvist, whose leg was already swelling up, calmly reached into her pocket, pulled out a golf tee and used it to gash open her bite and squeeze the venom out.

Lance Armstrong believes he should be given the opportunity to compete again, saying: 'I deserve to be punished. I'm not sure that I deserve a death penalty.' The 41-year-old Texan has confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs during all seven of his Tour de France victories. He was stripped of all results from August 1, 1998 and banned from sport for life. Armstrong was competing in triathlons, mountain bike events and marathons before he was sanctioned and believes he deserves that opportunity in the future, suggesting a life ban is not right. Scroll down for video . Red eyed: Lance Armstrong held back tears as he talked about his children and telling them the truth . Hope: Armstrong would like to be able to compete in sporting events in the future . Provocative: Armstrong tweeted a picture of him surrounded by his yellow Tour de France jerseys . Part two: On day one Armstrong admitted his doping - on day two he spoke about the effect on his family . Emotion: The only point where Armstrong showed emotion was when talking about his children - Isabella, Grace and his son Luke. Armstrong also has two more children from a second partner . He told Oprah Winfrey in the second . part of their television interview: 'I can't lie to you. I'd love the . opportunity to be able to compete, but that isn't the reason that I'm . doing this. 'Frankly, this might not be the most popular answer, but I think I deserve it (to be able to compete again). 'I deserve to be punished. I'm not sure that I deserve a death penalty.' Eleven of Armstrong's former team-mates provided evidence against him in exchange for six-month suspensions. Humbled: Armstrong said being separated from Livestrong was his must humbling moment . He added: 'If you look at the . situation, if you look at that culture, you look at the sport, you see . the punishments. I could go back to that time... you're trading my story . for a six-month suspension. That's what people got. What everybody got. 'I got a death penalty. I'm not saying that that's unfair, necessarily, but I'm saying it's different.' After years of denials, Armstrong . confirmed that during his record run, from 1999 to 2005, he used . blood-boosting agent EPO, blood doping, testosterone, cortisone and . human growth hormone. On the road: US Postal Service's Armstrong rides ahead of Team Phonak's Tyler Hamilton . Dodge: Armstrong undergoes a medical check-up in 2005 . Armstrong, who was last October . stripped of all results dating from August 1, 1998 and banned from sport . for life, denied doping during his comeback from retirement in 2009, . when he finished third in the Tour, and 2010 and refuted suggestions he . paid off cycling's world governing body, the UCI, to cover up a positive . test in 2001. In hindsight he wishes he had . co-operated with the United States Anti-Doping Agency investigation . which proved his downfall. Co-operation could have meant a lesser . penalty. Regrets? Armstrong wished he had confessed earlier so his punishment was lesser . Armstrong's long-time sponsors each . deserted him in quick succession following the publication of the USADA . report, but the most challenging moment was when his own Lance Armstrong . Foundation, the charity known now as Livestrong, distanced itself from . him. 'The foundation is like my sixth child . and to make that decision, and to step aside, was big,' said Armstrong, . who expressed his wish the charity can thrive without being associated . with him. Mixed reviews: Some said Oprah's interviewing style was excellent while others wish she pushed Armstrong further . 'I wouldn't at all say [I was] forced out, told to leave. I was aware of the pressure. 'It was the best thing for our organisation, but it hurt like hell. That was the lowest [moment].' Asked if he feels disgraced, Armstrong said: 'Of course, but I also feel humbled. I feel ashamed. This is ugly stuff. 'It's a process. And I think we're at the beginning of the process.' Deceit: Armstrong 'won' the Tour de France seven times, all of which came with the help of drugs . Armstrong confirmed he has been undergoing therapy to deal with his demons. His competitive desire remains, though. Asked whether he believes his life ban should be overturned, he said: 'Selfishly, yes. But realistically I don't think that's going to happen. And I have to live with that.' Winfrey asked Armstrong 'Did anyone know the whole truth?' He replied 'Yeah,' but there was no follow-up to ascertain who. Armstrong says he returned to cycling in 2009 and 2010 having agreed not to use performance-enhancing drugs again, yet evidence in the USADA report points to the contrary. He maintains the last time he doped was during his 2005 Tour de France win. Disgraced: Armstrong has admitted his history is 'ugly stuff' Armstrong was emotional when discussing his 13-year-old son Luke, with tears welling up in his eyes and hesitated in giving answers, his voice croaking. He had discovered Luke was defending him at school and had to address the matter. Armstrong said: 'That's when I knew I had to tell him. He'd never asked me. He'd never said ""Dad, is this true?"" He trusted me. He heard about it in the hallways. Don't defend me any more: Armstrong held back tears as he recalled talking to his son . 'I said ""Don't defend me anymore"". I said ""If anyone says anything to you, do not defend me. Just say my dad said he was sorry"". 'He said ""look, I love you, you're my dad, this won't change that"". 'Thank God he's more like Kristin (Armstrong's first wife and Luke's mother).' Emotional: Armstrong was close to tears when he explained how he admitted his cheating to children Luke, Grace and Isabella . The Oprah Winfrey Network insisted Armstrong did not receive a fee for the interview and was not offered one. Yet money is a concern after his sponsors departed. His admission has exposed him to numerous lawsuits, too. 'I've lost all future income,' he said. 'I don't like thinking about it, but that was a 75million-dollar day. Gone. And probably never coming back.' Armstrong denied claims he attempted to make a payment to USADA. He said: 'I had no knowledge of that, but I've asked around. I think the claim was 250,000 dollars. That's a lot of money. I would know. That is not true.'","Drug cheat cyclist feels he should be allowed to compete once again .

Trauma: Sarah Newton, from Hinckley, Leicestershire, woke up during an operation but could not communicate with the surgeons to let them know . A mother has described the agony of feeling a surgeon cutting into her stomach when she woke up during an operation. Sarah Newton lay paralysed on the operating table as she listened to doctors speaking above her and felt every incision they made. Unable to move or scream, she resorted to counting each stitch and staple that was used to sew her wounds while she waited for the ordeal to end. The 32-year-old spent 40 minutes trapped within her body, awake due to misjudged anaesthetic but paralysed by muscle relaxants, as unwitting doctors continued to operate. When the medication finally wore off, 20 minutes after the operation had finished, she was so traumatised that she became hysterical. University Hospital in Coventry has paid Miss Newton £30,000 in compensation after admitting a doctor ‘switched off the anaesthetic too early’. While the operation took place more than a year and a half ago, it has taken Miss Newton until now to build up the courage to speak about her ordeal. The mother-of-two was diagnosed in 2004 with inter-cranial hypertension, a brain condition which causes severe headaches and could lead to blindness. While she takes medication daily, doctors suggested she should have an operation to drain fluid from her brain to her stomach, which was completed in September 2010. She was then booked in for another four-hour procedure on her spine and stomach in April 2011 in the hope it would further relieve the pressure on her brain. The last thing Miss Newton remembers is having a tube fitted in her hand and then ‘going black’, before becoming aware of the most excruciating pain. ‘There are no words to describe what it felt like,’ she said. ‘I could feel them cutting across. It was them cutting my stomach open. I was unsure whether I was dreaming. The mother-of-two was diagnosed in 2004 with inter-cranial hypertension, a brain condition which causes severe headaches and could lead to blindness. Pictured above, before she was ill . ‘I could hear them talking but I couldn’t move at all. I was trying to scream. 'I tried to wiggle my toes desperately hard but I couldn’t move anything. I tried to raise my heartbeat to make them notice but they couldn’t notice. I couldn’t blink or anything. ‘The feeling of being trapped was worse than the pain. I have never experienced pure panic like it ever before. I really believed I was going to die. It felt as if I was being tortured but was powerless to stop it.’ Eventually, Miss Newton remembered that the stages of her operation had been explained to her by doctors before surgery, with the stomach being opened last, so she recognised they were towards the end of the procedure. ‘The only thing I could do was concentrate on what they were physically doing,’ she said. ‘I just had to get to the end of it. I could feel every stitch going in. I counted all the stitches. It’s infinite counting now in my nightmares. University Hospital in Coventry (above) has paid Miss Newton £30,000 in compensation after admitting a doctor 'switched off the anaesthetic too early' ‘And then the staples afterwards. I was able to tell them afterwards exactly how many they had done.’ In total, Miss Newton remembers 40 minutes of surgery, although it felt ‘like hours’. In recovery, she screamed uncontrollably. A nurse ran to get the anaesthetist and Miss Newton was able to recount to him the conversations he had been having during surgery. ‘The first thing I said was: “I was awake.” He was mortified. Straight away he knew. He kept saying: “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have done it.” Miss Newton’s consultant anaesthetist had decided that day to change his usual routine, which he had used treating more than 1,000 previous patients. He decided to switch off the anaesthetic before surgery was finished so that Miss Newton might become alert faster after the operation. He immediately accepted his error and while he kept his job, the hospital never contested Miss Newton’s complaint. The doctor was said to feel ‘deep regret’ over what happened. Soon after the operation, Miss Newton was diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress, suffering from anxiety attacks and becoming so agoraphobic that she did not leave the house for six months. She had to have four more urgent operations but refused to go to hospital, so was taken in by ambulance and given gas. She will not be given further surgery because she is not emotionally strong enough. Miss Newton, from Hinckley in Leicestershire, now takes morphine every day and has only recently built up the courage to start leaving her home. She is particularly upset that her children, Jack, eight, and Holly, five, have also suffered, adding: ‘I’m still angry – with the hospital, with the anaesthetist. I want them to face what happened.’ Meghana Pandit, of University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire, said: ‘On behalf of the Trust I apologise profusely to Miss Newton for her pain and distress.’","Sarah Newton, 32, spent 40 mins awake due to misjudged anaesthetic but was paralysed by .

It had women flocking to the High Street and won a string of female celebrity followers when it was launched in the UK last year. But the makers of a best-selling anti-ageing drink, which promises to banish wrinkles in just four weeks, were unprepared for the effect the supplement was to have on their customers’ other halves. After being inundated with requests from men, scientists have now developed a male version of the Pure Gold Collagen drink, which is due to go on sale at Boots later this month. Called Active Gold Collagen, it has been specially formulated not only to target fine lines and skin ageing, but also to repair muscle damage and boost cartilage production following exercise, as well as reducing hair loss, they say. After being inundated with requests from men, scientists have now developed a male version of anti-ageing drink Pure Gold Collagen . Experts are sceptical over the benefits of collagen drinks, which they claim are no better than eating a healthy diet. But despite this, customers bought Pure Gold Collagen, in their droves. It became the best-selling product on Boots website when it was launched last year and there is already a 7,000-stong waiting list for the men’s version. Like the women’s supplement, the men’s drink comes in 50ml bottles containing a daily dose of collagen, along with acids designed to promote its production. Reserves of collagen - the protein that gives skin strength and elasticity – deplete as the body gets older, causing skin to lose firmness and develop wrinkles. Active Gold has been specially formulated to slow down the 'internal' ageing of muscles and joints. But experts say the benefits of such supplements are unproven. Picture posed by model . Unlike the women’s drink, however, the men’s supplement also contains zinc, a nutrient which accelerates the renewal of skin cells and helps prevent hair loss and dandruff. Active Gold has also been formulated to slow down the ‘internal’ ageing of muscles and joints. It contains L-Carnitine, a nutrient which turns fat into energy and helps muscles recover after exercise, as well as glucosamine, a compound found in the body which helps in the repair of cartilage in joints and other body tissues that can slow with age. Manufacturers Minerva Research Labs say Active Gold is 50 times more effective than collagen creams, which are applied onto the top layers of skin, because it is absorbed deep into the skin’s dermis via the blood stream. The 'female' version of the drink (above) had women flocking to the High Street and won a string of celebrity followers when it was launched in the UK last year . In clinical trials on 1,500 men, aged 35 to 59, who drank the supplement daily, all said their skin appeared younger looking, with an average 26 per cent reduction in brow furrows in just 12 weeks. Eight out of 10 subjects said their skin felt up to 26 per cent better hydrated within eight weeks, while all said there was a reduction in the appearance of deep wrinkles and their skin, hair and joints felt healthier. Tony Sanguinetti, founder of Minerva Research Labs, said: ‘We were inundated with requests to formulate a liquid supplement for men that targets both internal ageing and external ageing and supports healthy hair, joints and muscles. ‘Active Gold Collagen allows quality active ingredients to work faster and collagen peptides to get into the blood stream and directly into the dermis.’ The women’s version of the drink has been endorsed by several celebrities. TV presenter  Anthea Turner, 52, said it was ‘one of the most effective skincare products’ she had tried. While presenter Carol Smillie, 50, claimed that, after taking the drink for a few weeks, ‘my skin looks and feels more youthful, radiant and hydrated’. According to analysts Datamonitor, the global market in anti-ageing drinks is expected to rise to around £41.3 billion by 2014. But experts say the benefits of such supplements are unproven. Dr Sam Bunting, a cosmetic dermatologist, said: ‘I just haven’t seen any evidence that explains why taking collagen orally should improve the quantity of collagen in your skin. ‘The collagen in a drink is broken down in your stomach. ‘Replenishing collagen stores is a complex and finely tuned biological process. 'You can’t cheat by importing these molecules “whole” from the diet. It offers no advantage that I’m aware of over normal dietary protein.’ Consultant dermatologist Dr Nick Lowe added that the drinks were ‘interesting’, but said: ‘More research is needed before we can be sure if they result in facial rejuvenation.’","Active Gold Collagen targets fine lines and skin ageing - and repairs muscle damage and boosts cartilage production after exercise, say makers .

Just like human crossword addicts, chimpanzees love having their brains teased, research has shown. The apes enjoy getting stuck into a puzzle - with or without the opportunity to win a prize. Scientists at Whipsnade Zoo, Bedfordshire, set up a game for six chimps that involved moving red dice through a network of pipes until they fell into a container. Crossword addict: Chimpanzees love having their brains teased and enjoy getting stuck into a puzzle - with or without the opportunity to win a prize, research has shown . To achieve their goal, players had to prod sticks into holes in the pipes to change the direction of the dice. The same task was also carried out using brazil nuts instead of dice, so that success led to a tasty treat. Researcher Fay Clark, from the Zoological Society of London, said: 'We noticed that the chimps were keen to complete the puzzle regardless of whether or not they received a food reward. 'This strongly suggests they get similar feelings of satisfaction to humans who often complete brain games for a feel-good reward.' The chimpanzees, all members of an adult family group at the zoo, did not receive advance training on how to play the game. 'For chimps in the wild, this task is a . little bit like foraging for insects or honey inside a tree stump or a . termite mound, except more challenging because the dice to not stick to . the tool,' said Ms Clark. Like humans, chimpanzees are motivated to solve a puzzle for its own sake, without needing a food reward, said the researchers . The findings are published today in the American Journal of Primatology. Researchers created higher 'levels' of challenge by connecting many pipes together, and making them opaque so the dice or nuts could only be glimpsed through small holes. The apes were given complete freedom whether or not to pit their wits in the puzzle, said the scientists. They chose to take part in the game despite also receiving treats hidden in boxes as part of the zoo's enrichment programme.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . UPDATED: . 05:20 EST, 23 February 2012 . Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has insisted its 787 Dreamliner jets - the world's first carbon-plastic passenger plane - are still safe to fly, despite 'flaws' found in the fuselage of one of its models. Boeing reported signs of 'delamination' on a support structure in the rear fuselage earlier this month - the latest in a series of glitches in developing the revolutionary jet. Delamination occurs when repeated stress causes laminated composite materials to begin to separate. Revolutionary: The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is the world's first carbon-plastic passenger plane . The company is now examining a backlog of assembled Dreamliners to see whether they show similar signs of stress, which it has blamed on incorrect 'shimming' - a process planemakers use to fill tiny gaps when aircraft are built. James Albaugh, chief executive officer of . Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said during a media briefing in Singapore: 'All the airplanes that were built up to plane 55 have the potential for the shimming issue.' However, Albaugh said the problem was 'very fixable'. He added: 'We are in the process of fixing the airplanes that are in the (production) flow. 'There is no safety or flight issue on the airplanes that we have delivered.' Although composite parts have been in use for years, the 787 is the first airliner built mainly out of the new materials, which help airlines save fuel by reducing aircraft weight. What dreams are made of: Inside the pioneering aircraft... but Boeing has insisted the plane is still safe to fly, in spite of its flaws . Albaugh said the inspections might affect delivery of the aircraft to customers in the short term, but Boeing still expects to meet its target for this year. The first six aircraft produced are generally test models. Analysts have said the discovery of the flaw after the first delivery of the aircraft last September has raised questions about whether Boeing can meet what many already saw as an ambitious plan to raise output to 10 Dreamliners a month by the end of 2013. Kenneth Herbert, Wedbush Securities analyst, said: 'People pretty much understood when the . news came out initially that it would affect the majority of the . Dreamliners that had been produced, because it was a workmanship issue. So I don't think this will be too much of an overhang on the stock.' Boeing currently makes 2.5 Dreamliners each month and expects to boost monthly output to 3.5 in the second quarter and to five by the end of the year. Herbert said many aviation experts and stock analysts expect Boeing to miss its production rate target next year and have already priced that view into the company's shares. Boeing has so far delivered five of the aircraft to Japan's All Nippon Airways, which has put the plane into regular passenger service since December 1. Due to production problems, that was three years later than originally planned. Japan Airlines has already said it no longer expects its first Dreamliner by the end of February as a result of the manufacturing glitch. The 787 problem comes as Boeing rival Airbus investigates the cause of cracks in part of the wings of its A380 superjumbo. It also insists its jets are safe. Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders pledged last week the plane-maker would apply lessons from the A380 glitches to the development of the A350, which is the European company's carbon-composite answer to the 787 Dreamliner. Boeing will decide whether to go ahead with plans to produce a stretched, or longer, version of the 787 Dreamliner by the end of this year, Albaugh said. Most aircraft analysts expected Boeing to push ahead with the 787-10, which would carry around 320 people, 40 more than the longest 787 version currently on offer, the 787-9.","Boeing reported signs of materials separating in fuselage .

But for residents of one West Midlands street, the eyesore in their neighbourhood appeared to have swallowed up an entire house. The ivy-consumed home has been a blot on the landscape for the last five years. But now workers have revealed the suburban home in all its glory after removing all its foliage when a new owner moved into the property. The wild plant has completely swallowed up the house in Cradley Heath in the West Midlands . That's better: The house after it was completely stripped of its ivy, pictured lying in the front garden . The out-of-control plant had invaded every wall of the three-bedroom detached property. As well as covering the house, the wild plant crept across the roof and forced its way through window frames, under roof tiles and caused damage to brickwork. Residents in the West Midlands street have had to put up with the blot on the landscape for five years . [caption . Locals say the ivy quickly grew out of control when the property's former owner, believed to have been an elderly woman, moved out. But now it looks as though neighbours will not have to contend with the wild plant any longer after a new owner called in the experts to hack away the greenery. Mother-of-one Brigid Duffy, who has lived opposite the property for 15 years, said the old owner of the house had battled with the ivy for a number of years. Workmen say they were constantly distracted from their work by grateful neighbours bringing them supplies of cups of tea as they tackled the wild plant . Locals say the ivy started its quest for dominance when the property's former owner moved out . 'But when she left it got out of control because nobody was trimming it back,' said solicitor Mrs Duffy. 'Then it just grew and grew and grew. 'It got to the point where you couldn’t actually see the house anymore. 'Every time we had visitors they would say: ‘My God - what is that across the road?’ 'The workmen cutting it down are my heroes.' Neighbours say they are delighted after the new owner of the property called in the experts . Having previously been covered in ivy, the upstairs windows and roof of the property can now be made out . Despite succeeding in removing the ivy from the detached house, it is unclear to what extent the plant has damaged brickwork . And the next-door neighbour of the property, retired civil servant Helen Key, 55, said she was also delighted to see the workmen show up. 'If you looked into the street from a distance it looked like there was a house then a big tree and then my house,' she said. David Sidwell, who works for the company tasked with tackling the ivy, said the job will take two people up to a week. 'It’s massive - a real major job,' said Mr Sidwell. 'We’ve got to take all the ivy off and then clean up the brickwork. It had even got through window frames and under roof tiles - and that’s when these jobs can get really serious. 'But we’ve been struggling to get on with it because all the neighbours keep coming up, saying they’re delighted it’s being done and making us cups of tea.' Average property prices in the West Midlands street, which have seen their value fall by ten percent in the past five years, are around £150,000. The ivy-clad house is not the first property to have annoyed neighbours forced to live alongside an eyesore. Angry neighbours in a smart . residential street in Plymouth have called for a derelict house to be knocked down . after it was left to rot for 30 years. The so-called 'Hairy House' in Plymouth has been a constant blot on the landscape for neighbours for years . The . £100,000 bungalow has become so overgrown . with trees and weeds, it's barely visible from the street and the roof . looks like it has sprouted hairs. Incredibly, . the house was lived-in until 18 months ago when the owner moved out - . after neglecting the property for three decades.

The schizophrenic patient of a Manhattan psychologist muttered that he didn’t mean to kill her with a meat cleaver and only wanted money to help out his ailing mother. David Tarloff, who is on trial in New York for the 2008 slaughtering of Dr Kathryn Faughey, 56, confessed to NYPD officers that he only meant to ‘tie her up and scare her’ in a video that was shown to the jury on Wednesday. During the ten-minute interrogation, the accused murderer also asked for the cops to bring him a sandwich, changing his mind several times between salami, pastrami, and corned beef. Throughout the interview, Tarloff, 44, has to be roused by the officers. Show him the money: A jury saw David Tarloff, a schizophrenic, in this 2008 police interrogation video following the murder of a psychologist; he said he only wanted money to take he and his nursing home-bound mother to Hawaii . As the hunt for the hatchet-Loss: Kathryn Faughey was brutally murdered in her Upper East Side office; the doctor she shared an office with was also badly wounded, but survived . His lawyers do not dispute the horrific February 16, 2008 crime, but are using the insanity defence, saying that because of his mental health. At one point in the video, Tarloff can be seen swaying his head and mumbling. An officer asks him if he would like a sandwich. ‘David? David?’ The detective prompts, finally getting Tarloff to say that he wanted ‘pastrami or salami. Actually I’ll have pastrami please, or corned beef,’ according to the New York Daily News. In a haunting moment of the interrogation, Tarloff confessed: ‘I didn’t want to kill them. All I wanted was money,’ he said, saying that his mother was forced to live in squalor at her nursing home. ‘She had been sitting in feces for five years,’ he muttered to the two detectives. Tarloff then recounted to the detectives how he first called Dr Faughey’s Upper East Side office to make sure she and Dr Kent Shinbach, with whom she shared a space, were there. He talked of plans to tie up Dr Shinbach and take the $50,000 and run. His confession was peppered with apologies. ‘I’m sorry. I only wanted money to go away,’ he said, according to the New York Post. He slashed the psychologist 15 times with a nine-inch meat cleaver. Trial begins: Opening statements begin earlier in this month in the case of David Tarloff, left, who confessed to killing therapist Kathryn Faughey, right, in her Manhattan office in 2008 . Under arrest: David Tarloff's lawyer is pursuing a rare insanity defense in a case that highlights how the legal system tends to hold even severely mentally ill people accountable for answering criminal charges . Prosecutors and Faughey's family say Tarloff carried out a considered, criminal plan. Tarloff admitted he wanted to rob Faughey's colleague with whom she shared an office to get money to take his sick mother to Hawaii, and was deemed mentally unfit for court months later. After doctors said his condition had improved, jury selection got started in 2010 but he was again declared unfit. Authorities say that Tarloff set out with a bag full of knives . to hold up his psychiatrist for . $50,000, grab his mother out of a nursing home, and escape with her to . Hawaii. The trial's jury will be asked to decide whether . Tarloff, who has a decades-long history of hospitalizations and . hallucinations about God and Satan speaking to him, knew he was doing . wrong when he killed Dr Faughey. They had never met. He had said he was frightened that she was going to attack him because her long fingernails alarmed him. 'Believe me, I wish she was never there - but I thought she was evil,' Tarloff told a psychologist in 2010. 'I went to kill her. I thought I . had no choice.' 'Everything about his thought process was so bizarre - so crazy - that . the proof in the case shows he was legally insane,' lawyer Bryan Konoski . has said. However prosecutors and Faughey's family feel that, whatever Tarloff's . illness, his actions bespoke a considered, violent scheme. 'He planned this out' and was heavily armed, said Owen Faughey, one of . her brothers. 'He was determined, it would seem, to stop anyone who . would interfere with his plan. And, unfortunately, that's where our . sister fell victim to his plan. He should be held fully accountable.' Murdered: Psychotherapist Kathryn Faughey was fatally attacked with a meat cleaver at her office by David Tarloff in February 2008' It was an accident that Tarloff and Faughey, a 56-year-old therapist who . specialized in helping people with relationships, met at all. Faughey . shared an office with psychiatrist Dr Kent Shinbach, who treated . Tarloff in 1991 but hadn't seen him since. Yet in February 2008, as an increasingly panicky Tarloff tried to craft . what he saw as a rescue plan for his mother, he thought of Shinbach. He . figured the psychiatrist had money, and he'd get it from an ATM after . forcing the doctor to disclose his code, Tarloff later told police and . psychologists. 'I figured a little bump on the head. No one would know, and I would have $40,000,' Tarloff said. He went to Shinbach's office one evening with a rubber mallet, a set of . kitchen knives, rope, duct tape, a suitcase full of adult diapers and . clothing for his mother — and a belief that the plan had God's blessing, . he told a psychologist. He encountered Faughey instead and hacked her 15 times, then seriously wounded Shinbach when he tried to save her. Court case: Tarloff pictured in court at the beginning of his long-delayed trial with disheveled hair and a five o'clock shadow . Tarloff, now 44, was a college student when his mind abruptly began . fracturing into paranoid suspicions of classmates and a preoccupation . with God and the devil. Over the years, as he was hospitalized more than a dozen times, he . recounted seeing 'Satan' spelled out in his mind and the 'eye of God' on . the kitchen floor, according to psychologists' reports and court . papers. He heard police sirens and concluded they'd been summoned by his . bad thoughts. He viewed pieces of paper on the street as a special . message from God. His relatives begged him to stay in mental hospitals or adult homes, but he left them, psychologists said. After his mother, Beatrice, moved from the Queens apartment they shared . into a nursing home in 2004, Tarloff grew still more erratic and . fixated. Convinced she wasn't getting good care at a series of homes, he . repeatedly clashed with staffers. Two weeks before Faughey's death, he . got arrested in a scuffle with a security guard at a hospital where his . mother was being treated.

Years before Jodi Arias went on trial for allegedly murdering her boyfriend, the young woman told CBS's 48 Hours that she would have gained nothing from the gristly slaying. During a 10-day lull in the courtroom proceedings, CBS is planning to re-air the conversation with Arias, which was originally recorded in 2008, just months after the woman's former boyfriend, Travis Alexander, was found stabbed, shot and brutally mutilated in his apartment in suburban Mesa, Arizona. During the no-holds-barred 48 Hours interview, Arias discussed the night Alexander died, their illicit sexual encounters and her fondness for taking explicit photos of the lovers that are now being used as evidence in her murder trial. Scroll down to watch preview . Jailhouse talk: Jodi Arias sat down for a 48 Hours interview with a CBS reporter in 2008 to talk about the night Travis Alexander was murdered . Bogus tale: At the time, Arias said that she and Alexander were attacked by a pair of men who assaulted her lover with a knife and gun . 'I’ve been sitting a lot in my cell thinking, ""What a waste,"" you know? I did have my whole future ahead of me,' Arias told a reporter five years ago. 'I had everything to lose and nothing to gain if I killed Travis. I loved him and still love him,' RadarOnline reported. The 32-year-old California resident could face the death penalty if convicted of murdering the 30-year-old Alexander in June 2008. Arias is accused of stabbing the Mormon real estate agent and motivational speaker 27 times, shooting him in the face and slitting his throat from ear to ear in the shower of his apartment after the two had a sexual encounter. In mid-August 2008, two months after the gruesome slaying that had shaken the Mesa community, Arias sat down with CBS reporter Maureen Maher for a jailhouse interview that eventually made it into the 48 Hours segment called Picture Perfect - The Trial of Jodi Arias. In the course of the lengthy talk, the media-savvy suspect offered her fabricated version of events, claiming that after she and Alexander had had sex, two men dressed in black broke into his home and attacked the 30-year-old with a knife and a gun. On trial: Jodi Arias is charged with murder in the June 2008 death of her on-again-off-again boyfriend Travis Alexander . Heavy penalty: If convicted, Arias could get the death penalty, becoming just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row . Her lover was stabbed on the floor, . but Arias said she managed to escape. She added that she never told . anyone about the deadly attack because she was afraid, but she was . certain at the time that Alexander was alive. 'It . was the scariest experience of my life,' she said of the bogus home . invasion. 'It was just so unreal. It was like a move unfolding. Like a . horrible movie.' Police have . since exposed Arias' tale as a boldfaced lie, and even her defense . attorneys said that their client was not telling the truth in the wake . of the murder. Arias . eventually changed her story, telling investigators that she killed . Alexander in self-defense, describing him as a sexually promiscuous, . brutal man who sought to control her. On Thursday, jurors in the Arias . trial were shown graphic photos of the defendant and her slain paramour . taken on the day of his murder. In some of the pictures, Alexander appears alive in the shower, while another image captured his dead body on the floor. The day before, a videotaped . interrogation of the 32-year-old was played in court. A detective . grilled Arias, explaining that all the evidence points to her. She . insisted she did not kill him. Mesa police detective Esteban Flores continued to press her on the tape. Conflicting words: Jurors in the trial watched a videotaped interrogation of Arias Wednesday during which she insists she didn't kill Travis Alexander, right, but says if she had, she would have killed him quickly and humanely . ‘You shot him in the head, then you got a knife and you stabbed him,’ Flores said. ‘Jodi, tell me the truth, please.’ ‘I did not kill Travis,’ Arias . replied. However, she said if she were to have killed him, she couldn't . have stabbed him. It would have been too cruel. ‘I don't think I could stab him. I . think I would have to shoot him until he was dead if that were my . intentions,’ Arias told the detective. ‘But I would have to wear gloves. ‘If I had it in me to kill him, the least I could have done was make it as humane as possible,’ she added. If found guilty of murder, Arias would become just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row. She allegedly stabbed and slashed . Alexander nearly 30 times, slitting his throat from ear to ear, and shot . him in the head around June 4, 2008, at his Mesa home. His body was . found five days later in his shower by roommates. Graphic: Witness Leslie Udy was shown graphic photographs taken of her friend Jodi Arias on June 4, 2008 by the prosecution to show that perhaps she did not know everything about her 'gentle' friend . Crime scene: Photographs shown in the murder trial of Jodi Arias show the crime scene at Travis Alexander's home in Mesa, California after his body was found . Bloodied: Investigators described the 2008 crime scene as among the most gruesome they'd ever seen . Prosecutors say Arias came prepared . to kill the 30-year-old devout Mormon, businessman and motivational . speaker, and neglected to call police after leaving behind a crime scene . that investigators described as among the most gruesome they'd ever . seen. They say she attacked him in a . jealous rage after he broke up with her. She says she broke up with him . after about five months of dating, but the two continued to see each . other sexually. Arias' attorney, Jennifer Willmott, . told jurors in opening statements that Alexander ‘lunged at Jodi in . anger’ on the day he was killed, and she had to defend herself.

Osama bin Laden's son-in-law and the 'mouthpiece' for al-Qaeda pleaded not guilty today to charges he conspired to kill Americans on 9/11. Sulaiman Abu Ghaith entered the plea through a lawyer just blocks from where the World Trade Center once stood. He  has been charged with . participating in a conspiracy to kill Americans in relation to the 9/11 . attacks, according to a newly-unsealed indictment. Ghaith was arrested in a dramatic take-down by CIA officials in Jordan several days ago, and is now being held in a detention facility in lower Manhattan. Scroll down for video .

Proximity: This map shows the distance between the World Trade Center site and U.S. District Court, where Abu Ghaith will appear today . In 2001, Abu Ghaith is said to have . been imprisoned alongside al-Qaeda’s military director Saif al-Adel and . bin Laden's son Saad, after the leader sent them to Iran in the . hopes that they would be seen as ‘an enemy of my enemy,’ a U.S. official . said. Although the U.S. would not confirm . the conditions of their confinement, Iranian officials told NBC News the . al-Qaeda leaders had been captured shortly after their arrival in the . country in 2001 and had spent time ‘in jail.’ Court papers state that before the 9/11 attacks, bin Laden 'summoned' Ghait to his side and asked for his assistance. Ghaith then warned the U.S. and its allies that 'a great army is gathering against you' and after the terror attacks 'the storms shall not stop, especially the Airplanes Storm.' He is scheduled for his arraignment in U.S. District Court today before Judge Lewis Kaplan. The court is located less than a mile from the World Trade Center towers, which were destroyed in the 9/11 . terror attacks. He is currently being held in the 'terror wing' at the Metropolitan Correctional Center near the federal courthouse, the New York Post said. The prison has previously held such high-value arrests such as radical preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri. Ghaith will be the most senior al-Qaeda member and closest bin Laden associate to face a trial in New York. Day in court: Abu Ghaith's trial will most likely be in U.S. District Court, pictured, less than a mile from the site of the 9/11 attacks . Others, including 'mastermind' Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, are being tried by a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Attorney General Holder said in a statement: 'No amount of distance or time will weaken our resolve to bring America's enemies to justice. 'To violent extremists who threaten the American people and seek to undermine our way of life, this arrest sends an unmistakable message: . 'There is no corner of the world where you can escape from justice because we will do everything in our power to hold you accountable to the fullest extent of the law.' Records compiled by a United Nations . sanctions committee show that Abu Ghaith was born in Kuwait in 1965, but . that he left Kuwait for Pakistan in June 2001. He then married one of bin Laden's daughters, Fatima. 'Ghaith  held a key position in al-Qaeda, comparable to the consigliere in a mob family or propaganda minister in a totalitarian regime,' said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Venizelo. After the September 11 attacks, Ghaith first surfaced as one of al-Qaeda's main spokesmen. Later, . U.S. officials believe he was part of a group of top figures in the . group that included one of bin Laden's sons, Saad, who allegedly . traveled to Iran, where the Iranian government claimed they were 'in . custody.' The Long War . Journal, a counterterrorism blog published by the conservative . Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, reported in 2010 that Abu . Ghaith had been released by Iranian authorities and supposedly had . returned to Afghanistan. Rep. Peter King (R-NY) announced Ghaith's arrest on Thursday, hailing it as a 'very significant victory' in the ongoing fight against al-Qaeda. King, the former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said the CIA and FBI had caught Ghaith within the last week. He said the arrest was confirmed by U.S. law enforcement officials. Ghaith had allegedly taken part in the September 11 plot against the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Hunted down: Osama Bin Laden, left, was killed in 2011 in Pakistan after years of searching.

Wanted: Ghaith had been considered 'stateless' since since he lost his Kuwaiti citizenship after videos emerged showing him praising the September 11 attacks . 'Definitely, one by one, we are getting the top echelons of al-Qaeda,' King said on Thursday. 'I give the (Obama) administration credit for this: it's steady and it's unrelenting and it's very successful.' A terrorism analyst called  Ghaith a 'big fish' who represents the 'core of al-Qaeda.' 'Ghaith is one of ten guys left that have the financial ties and reputation who might have been able to get the old band back together to execute spectacular international terror attacks,' Dr. Thomas Lynch at the National Defense University told ABC News. Turkish newspaper Hürriyet reported that Ghaith was passing through Jordan, on his way to Kuwait from Turkey when he was apprehended. Terror: After the September 11 attacks, Abu Ghaith first surfaced as one of al-Qaeda's main spokesmen . The newspaper said that Ghaith was initially taken into custody more than a month ago at a luxury hotel in the Turkish capital Ankara. Turkish officials decided he had not committed any crime in Turkey and released him the newspaper reported. A Turkish court reportedly ruled that . Abu Ghaith entered the country illegally from Iran on a fake passport . and was ordered to be deported. As a result of that ruling, Abu Ghaith . was seized in Jordan by CIA agents while en route to Kuwait. Ghaith . had been considered 'stateless' since since he lost his Kuwaiti . citizenship after videos emerged showing him praising the September 11 . attacks. However, Turkish officials refused to confirm Ghaith's deportation or his capture in Jordan to The Associated Press. In Amman, the Jordanian capital, a security official said he had no information on the CIA arrest. U.S. intelligence officials in Washington did not immediately respond to request for information about Ghaith either. 'I trust he received a vigorous interrogation, and will face swift and certain justice,' King added.","Al Qaeda spokesman Sulaiman Abu Ghaith arrested in Jordan last week .

"By . Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 21:00 EST, 10 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:54 EST, 11 March 2013 . More than 100 MPs will this week demand ministers rip up human rights laws which have allowed hundreds of foreign criminals to stay in Britain. Proposals to come before the House of Commons within days would - it is hoped - end the flood of foreign convicts escaping deportation by claiming their right to a ‘private and family life’. The changes are being put forward by a cross-party group of MPs led by prominent Tory backbencher Dominic Raab and former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett. The relatively simple amendments to the law have gathered unprecedented levels of Parliamentary support, putting huge pressure on ministers to adopt them. Abuse: MPs want to stop foreign criminals staying in the country by claiming their right to a 'private and family life' under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act. File picture . Without the changes, Article 8 will carry on being abused by killers, rapists, robbers and drug dealers. The cases include many overseas offenders who have made successful appeals despite not having any children living in this country. If passed, they would send a clear message to immigration judges who have to date defied efforts to get rid of the ‘family route’ loophole. Mr Raab, the MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘This change is vital to stop the flow of serious - and often vicious - criminals running rings around our deportation system, making a mockery of British justice. ‘There’s a groundswell of cross-party support in favour of finally doing something about these appalling cases. Let’s stop talking about it, and start doing something.’ MP Dominic Raab said: 'This change is vital to stop the flow of serious - and often vicious - criminals running rings around our deportation system, making a mockery of British justice' Last year Home Secretary Theresa May . changed the immigration rules to limit use of Article 8 by foreign . criminals. Under the 2007 Borders Act those from outside the EU . sentenced to at least a year in jail should face automatic deportation . to their home country. This . helped reduce the number of human rights challenges from nearly 400 to . around 212 per year - of which the vast majority were Article 8 related. William Danga, an illegal immigrant and child rapist, successfully used Article 8 to stay in the UK . But the immigration courts have made clear in a series of cases, that they would ignore the new edicts and follow their own case law - because ministers changed guidance and not primary legislation. Ministers are thought likely to propose a similar change with a new Bill later this year or early next. But the amendment proposed this week - a straightforward nine word change to a Bill currently before Parliament, would become law much sooner. It is backed by 93 Tories, giving it more backing than any previous backbench proposal in this Parliament. Supporters include three former criminal justice ministers, Nick Herbert, Crispin Blunt and Jonathan Djanogly. The change would not stop criminals taking their cases to Strasbourg, but it would limit them to using Articles 2 and 3 of the Human Rights Act - which protect against anyone likely to be killed, tortured or mistreated if returned. Among those who have successfully used Article 8 to stay in Britain are William Danga, a sex attacker who raped and violently molested two young girls while fighting deportation on human rights grounds. The 40-year-old Congolese asylum seeker was jailed for ten years for raping a sixteen-year-old girl. He used his two children to stay in Britain - then attacked again after his release from prison. His victims were a four year-old girl and another aged just seven. It is thought there are around 4,000 overseas convicts now living in the UK which the government want to remove but are blocked from doing so by human rights laws.","More than 100 MPs back law change to end foreign criminals staying in UK .

A new treaty was agreed yesterday to protect sharks - including the porbeagle species which is native to British waters. Five species of sharks and two manta rays were given protection under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). Governments voted earlier in the week in favour of the move to list the sharks and rays as species under the Cites treaty, which will mean the international trade in them is strictly regulated to ensure it is sustainable. Protection: A Porbeagle shark. The species which is native to British waters is among five species of sharks and two manta rays which have been given protection under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species . 'Shark populations are in free fall, but have been thrown a lifeline today - Cites has finally listened to the scientists,' Ali Hood, director of conservation for the Shark Trust, said. He added: 'This is a tremendous result, reflecting years of campaigning for trade controls for these high-value species. 'Now parties face the challenge of implementation, and we urge the EU to reach out and assist less-developed nations with capacity building and practical implementation.' There were concerns that the final . Cites meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, could reverse the decision but the . move was confirmed yesterday. A fisherman carries a hammerhead shark at Manzanillo beach some 240 kilometers east of San Jose, Mexico . Two species of manta rays were also given protection under the Convention . Conservationists . say protection is necessary to reverse declining numbers of sharks and . rays, which are being overfished for food and so-called Traditional . Chinese Medicine, or TCM. Almost 100 million sharks are caught . every year, targeted largely for their fins for use in shark fin soup, . which is a delicacy in Asia and especially in China, wildlife experts . say. Hunters hack the fins off live . animals and then toss the creatures back into the ocean to drown. Many . of China's richest citizens believe the soup has medicinal benefits and . serve it at celebrations. Each fin can fetch up to £380 ($600) a pound, with a single bowl of the prized soup fetching up to £108. But as species which are slow-growing and slow to reproduce, the sharks are vulnerable to overfishing.

Conservationists . say protection is necessary to reverse declining numbers of sharks and . rays, which are being overfished for food and so-called Traditional . Chinese Medicine . Manta rays have also seen numbers . decline dramatically in some areas in the face of a growing trade in . their gill plates, which are sold in China as medicine claimed to treat a . range of health complaints from asthma to chickenpox and even cancer. Some . countries have been reluctant to include marine species, which can . generate large revenues, in the treaty that regulates or bans . international trade in wildlife. The shark fin business is worth an . estimated £320 million a year. Bad taste: A bowl of shark fin soup. The dish sells for up to £108 at Chinese restaurants . UK fisheries minister Richard Benyon welcomed the move: 'I am extremely pleased to see that the Porbeagle, three Hammerheads, the Oceanic Whitetip sharks and the Manta rays have all received greater protection under Cites. 'The UK government has been leading calls for greater protection of sharks and I feel very strongly that trade in these vulnerable species must be regulated to ensure it is sustainable and so I welcome the positive step that Cites has taken.' Until 2010, there was small fishing quota for porbeagle sharks in British and other European waters when commercial landings were banned due to overfishing. The sharks were caught as bycatch rather than targeted. The decline of porbeagles in the North East Atlantic is worse than anywhere else in the world. They can grow to more than 11.5 feet (3.5 metres) long and their prey is mainly fish such as mackerel, herring and pilchard. A 10-feet long porbeagle hooked by two anglers off the Cornish coast last year is believed to be the biggest recorded in UK waters – they released it alive. A U.N. agency also warned yesterday shark populations in the Mediterranean and Black Sea 'have dropped dramatically' over the past two centuries because of overfishing. A study released by the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization says sharks in the Mediterranean have declined by more than 97 percent over the past 200 years and 'risk extinction if current fishing pressure continues.' In the Black Sea, catches of the main shark species have declined by about half.","Five species of sharks and two manta rays were given protection .

Residents living near the pensioner on Billacombe Road in Plymstock, Plymouth, Devon, have repeatedly suggested Mr Hackett trim back his collection of firs. Welcome to the jungle: William Hackett, 74, pictured standing outside him home in Plymouth, Devon, after locals complained about the 50ft trees which now completely obscure his property . But while Mr Hackett, 74, accepts his front garden is somewhat busy, he feels he shouldn't be blamed because other people dislike trees. Mr Hackett's collection includes fir trees and a Tree of Heaven - Ailanthus altissima - which is native of China and grows to 80ft or more. Neighbours have now reported his garden to Plymouth City Council.

Experts calculate that the terrier's . big day is the equivalent of turning 100 in human years - after . scrapping the claim that one dog year equals seven human years, because . different breeds age at a different rate. And . Mr Barsby-Finch, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, puts Daisy's . longevity down to her long walks in the countryside - and her refusal to . eat dog food. He said: 'Daisy has never had a tin of dog food in her life, she eats exactly what we eat. 'Her favourite meal is roast chicken and mashed potatoes, but she'll happily eat anything. 'She's partial to a takeaway Chinese, and she loves a homemade chilli too, as long as it's not too spicy. 'I wouldn't dream of giving her scraps - I cook an extra portion of food just for her, and she eats before the rest of the family. 'She's definitely a very pampered pooch, but she deserves it. She's given us a lot of pleasure over the years.' Mr Barsby-Finch, 48, adopted Daisy from Cheltenham Animal Shelter for his niece, Claire, back in 1993, after she had begged her family for a dog. Animal shelter workers didn't have an exact date of birth for Daisy - but believed her to be at least 24 months old when she was adopted. Although the oldest dog ever known to have lived in the UK reached the age of 26, it is believed that Daisy is the oldest living dog. When the family moved into a home that needed major renovations, Daisy moved back in with Mr Barsby-Finch after she gaining a reputation as an escape artist. But strong-willed Daisy decided she didn't want to move back after the renovations were finished and made it clear she'd rather stay put. Daisy, pictured left with Mr Barsby-Finch's mother Beryl, 85, and right with her owner, is believed to be the oldest living dog in the UK. The Jack Russell terrier has lived with the family for 20 years since being rescued . Life is a bit more sedate for Daisy as she gets older, but she still enjoys playing with ice cubes and sleeping . Mr Barsby-Finch said: 'When we rescued Daisy, they told us she was the runt of the litter and wouldn't have been expected to survive long. 'She was left to wander farmland as a stray before someone found her and took her to the shelter. 'When we first adopted her, we had access to 40 acres of farmland, and Daisy used to be off out into the fields first thing in the morning, and she'd suddenly reappear just in time for her tea. 'She has always hated going for walks on the lead, but give her a field to run around and she's off. Daisy enjoys playing with ice cubes and sleeping. Mr Barsby-Finch said: 'I used to have an ice machine, which was quite noisy, and she figured out how to knock it so the ice fell to the floor. 'I give her one or two cubes as a treat now and then, and she loves them. 'She spends most of the time sleeping now, but apart from being missing a few teeth and being a bit hard of hearing, she's in really good health. 'We don't know the date of her real birthday, but we have always celebrated it on the day we adopted her, February 21. 'We had a little party for her, and let her have a bit of cake - but the humans probably enjoyed it more than Daisy. 'Hopefully we'll be celebrating many more birthdays to come.'","Daisy, a Jack Russell, was rescued in 1993 when she was two .

Celia, mother to five year old Matthew, started the business after she became overwhelmed trying to juggle motherhood with a 70 hour working week as an NHS financial troubleshooter. She said of the retreat: 'This is a direct response to people putting too much pressure on themselves to succeed in the workplace, and making themselves ill. Better work-life balance: Celia said she struggled working 11 hours a day and being a mother to Matthew, now age five . 'I should know because it happened to me. I was in a demanding job but I was putting myself under a lot of pressure and in the end it all got too much for me. 'I was working 11 hours a day from 7.30am to 6.30pm Monday to Friday but was also taking work home in the evenings and was working at weekends. I couldn't switch off. I also had a baby at home and that also played a part. 'I was overdoing it and it was my own fault.

Shocking video allegedly showing U.S. Security contractors drunk, stoned and engaging in outlandish behavior while they were in Afghanistan protecting American lives has been leaked by two whistle blowers. The footage is believed to have been recorded earlier this year at a Jorge Scientific operations center in Kabul. It appears to show key personnel drunk or high on drugs, chugging drinks, semi-naked wrestling and injecting drugs. The alleged behavior went undetected by U.S. military officials and put American lives at risk. The whistle blowers revealed that if a terrorist attack had been made at this time, then employees would have been too 'out of it' to respond. Scroll down for video . Shocking video: The security manager for the company can be seen half-naked and chugging a glass of vodka at the covert location in Afghanistan . Drunk: Melson said there is no way any of the employees involved would have been able to respond to any terror attack because they were so 'out of it' Outlandish behavior: As two of the men wrestle, bottle of alcohol - which is supposed to be forbidden - can be seen lined up in the background . Lawsuit: The footage is believed to have been recorded earlier this year at a Jorge Scientific operations center in Kabul and appears to show key personnel drunk or high on drugs, chugging drinks, semi-naked wrestling and injecting drugs . Two former employees, John Melson . and Kenny Smith, gave the video to ABC and say it documents a number of allegations they have made in a . lawsuit against Jorge Scientific. The U.S. Army has now launched a criminal investigation into the Virginia-based company, who has won almost $1 billion in U.S. government contracts. They said they were unaware of both the video and the allegations until last month. Whistle blowers Melson and Smith worked as armed . security officers for three and five months respectively, in Kabul as . part of a $47 million contract Jorge Scientific had under the U.S. Legacy Program to train the Afghan National Police in counter-insurgency . efforts. They said they quit out of sheer disgust for the behavior, because of the way they were treated by their colleagues, who would bully them for not joining in the party, and out of concern their own safety was being compromised by the behavior. Melson, a National Guard sergeant who served in uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan before working for Jorge Scientific, told ABC: 'It was going against everything that we were trying to do over there. It was like a frat house for adults. 'Some of them to the point where they were passing out, . there's firearms laying around, some of them still carrying the firearms . on them.' Admission: Medical officer Kevin Carlson admitted that he frequently injected himself with narcotics just to 'get away' because the place was such a 'nightmare' High: The medical officer appeared totally out of it after injecting himself with Ketamine, the used syringe is shown lying on the floor beside him . The company says it has taken . 'decisive action to correct the unacceptable behavior of a limited . number of employees' and that several of them seen on the video are no . longer employed by Jorge Scientific. In . a short clip of the video provided to ABC, the security manager for the . company can be seen chugging a glass of vodka and staggering around . before starting a wrestling match with another employee. Several bottles of alcohol can be seen sitting on a table in the background. The . use of alcohol or illegal drugs by U.S. contractors in Afghanistan is . prohibited by the military, with the manual describing a . 'zero-tolerance' as personnel must be on alert 24/7 for possible . terrorist attacks. The . video then switches to the company's medical officer after he allegedly . injected himself with Ketamine. The man stares at the camera wide and . glassy eyed, not being able to respond when asked a question. When . asked about the video, medical officer Kevin Carlson admitted to ABC . that he frequently injected himself with narcotics just to 'get away' because the place was such a 'nightmare'. Though . he is no longer employed with them, he revealed there was 'massive drug . and alcohol abuse' at that Jorge Scientific facility, involving . executives, armed security personnel and himself. Whistle blower: John Melson, a National Guard sergeant who served in uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan before working for Jorge Scientific, quit after only three months . Accuser: Melson said he quit because of the way he was treated by their colleagues, who would bully them for not joining in the party, out of sheer disgust, and out of concern that their own safety was being compromised by the behavior . The company's senior on-site executive Chris Sullivan was often the ringleader behind the parties and would try to pressure others into taking part, the suit alleges. He would also allegedly hold blazing bonfires in the outdoor patio despite the fact the location was supposed to be covert. Employees would often throw live ammunition rounds . and fire extinguishers into the flames and watch as they exploded, often . sounding like a real bomb explosion, the whistle blowers claim. Melson said: 'There was nothing covert with bringing all that added attention. Afghanistan is not the time or the place . to be carrying on like that.' Sullivan does not work with Jorge Scientific any more and refused to comment on the allegations. In a statement to ABC News, Colonel Tom Collins, a U.S. Army spokesperson for the International Security Assistance Force, said: 'Clearly, behavior such as that described by ABC News is not indicative of the outstanding work that thousands of contractors and service members perform every day in Afghanistan. 'We are confident that our personnel conduct themselves in ways that makes our nation proud and we should not allow the actions of a few, if determined to be true, to detract from that fact.' Jorge is now conducting their own investigation but said they made management changes to the operation in Afghanistan before the lawsuit was filed. Their statement said: 'These individuals are seeking monetary damages by mis-characterizing . these actions as ""fraud"". 'The company remains confident that the personal misconduct did not . impact the company's contract performance.' If the allegations turn out to be true, it may stoke U.S.-Afghan relations even further and could add to rage over perceived U.S. disrespect for local values. 'This arrogant image that Americans have worldwide, this was feeding right into it,' said Melson.

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 08:42 EST, 7 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:44 EST, 7 March 2013 . The handwritten notes which saved the lives of the astronauts on the  Apollo 13 mission are set to fetch £60,000 at auction. The notes, made famous by the hit 1995 film starring Tom Hanks, were used by Commander Jim Lovell to work out how to perform a vital 'burn' on the way back to Earth. If Commander Lovell had got the sums wrong then it is likely that he and his fellow astronauts, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, would have perished in space. Scroll down for video . If Commander Lovell had got the sums wrong then it is likely that he and his fellow astronauts, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, would have perished in space . The single sheet on which Commander Lovell's notes were written is actually page 30 of the Apollo 13 contingency checklist . On April 13, 1970, the Apollo 13 moon mission was aborted  200,000 miles from Earth when an oxygen tank exploded. The explosion caused another tank to fail, seriously jeopardizing the three-man crew's ability to return home. Astronaut Jack Swigert famously said 'Houston, we've had a problem here' after the explosion, according to a NASA history of the flight. The crew was forced to move into the lunar landing module for the return flight. Lovell's calculations on the checklist were key in the survival of the three astronauts on board. The world was said to have held its breath after Apollo 13 suffered an explosion on its way to the Moon in April 1970. The blast left the spacecraft crippled, prompting the famous line 'Houston, we've had a problem' from Commander Lovell. Despite facing great difficulties due to limited power, plummeting temperatures, shortage of water and rising carbon dioxide levels the crew returned safely to Earth four days later. The single sheet on which Commander Lovell's notes were written is actually page 30 of the Apollo 13 contingency checklist. He used the sheet to record critical spacecraft altitude procedures to allow the crew to accurately perform the hugely important 'mid-course correction burn number five'. The burn was designed to fire the engine up enough to boost the spacecraft's speed another 860 feet per second. This meant the crew would get back to Earth quicker which would greatly enhance their chances of survival. The burn forms a key scene in Ron Howard's Oscar-winning Apollo 13 film, in which Commander Lovell tries to keep the Earth in the spacecraft's window while performing the manoeuvre. The original crew of Apollo 13 were Jim Lovell, Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise (pictured left to right). Mattingly missed the mission due to illness . As the crippled spacecraft's navigation equipment was not working correctly the commander used the Earth as a reference point. If the craft had been pointing in the wrong direction at the time of the burn the crew would likely have been shot into space with no hope of correcting their course to return home. The sheet, which contains Commander Lovell's hand-written notes, is being sold by Mr Haise, who is now 79-years-old and living in Florida. Last year a new law was introduced in the USA that allowed Apollo-era astronauts to keep items from their missions. Although they were told they could keep certain things by their managers, there was always uncertainty over the issue which made it difficult for them to sell items at auction. Matthew Haley, specialist in space history at Bonhams, said: ‘The crew had to abort the mission to land on the Moon because of the explosion. Apollo 13 eventually came back to Earth and landed in the South Pacific . ‘They were using the lunar module as a lifeboat and all of the standard procedures went out of the window. ‘The crew were getting constant instructions from Mission Control. That is why they are covered in the annotations. It is very, very unusual to have so many annotations. ‘Anything flown on Apollo 13 is rare but something like this with the annotations from Jim Lovell and Fred Haise is rarer still. ‘It gives us an interesting insight into the atmosphere inside the spacecraft.’ The Apollo space program was responsible for putting the first man on the moon. It was the Apollo 11 mission which saw astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walk on the moon on July 20, 1969. The Apollo programme was abandoned in 1972 due to budget cuts.

A newly deciphered Egyptian text which dates back almost 1,200 years tells part of the crucifixion story of Jesus with never heard before apocryphal plot twists. The ancient text tells of Pontius Pilate, the judge who authorised Jesus' crucifixion, offering to sacrifice his own son in the place of Jesus. The text also claims that Jesus had the ability to change shape and puts the day of the arrest of Jesus on Tuesday evening rather than Thursday evening - contravening the Easter timeline. Roelof van den Broek, of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, published the translation in the book Pseudo-Cyril of Jerusalem on the Life and the Passion of Christ (Brill, 2013). He said the text doesn't mean these events happened, but that some people living at the time appear to have believed in them. Copies of the text are found in two manuscripts, one in the Morgan Library and Museum in New York City and the other at the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. Most of the translation comes from the New York text, because the relevant text in the Pennsylvania manuscript is mostly illegible. Van den Broek wrote in an email to LiveScience that while apocryphal stories about Pilate are known from ancient times, he has never heard of Pilate offering to sacrifice his own son in the place of Jesus. The text in translation says: 'Without further ado, Pilate prepared a table and he ate with Jesus on the fifth day of the week. And Jesus blessed Pilate and his whole house.' Pilate is said to later tell Jesus: 'Well then, behold, the night has come, rise and withdraw, and when the morning comes and they accuse me because of you, I shall give them the only son I have so that they can kill him in your place.' In the text, Jesus comforts him, saying: 'Oh Pilate, you have been deemed worthy of a great grace because you have shown a good disposition to me.' Jesus also showed Pilate that he could escape if he chose to. The text continues: 'Pilate, then, looked at Jesus and, behold, he became incorporeal: He did not see him for a long time ...'. Pilate and his wife both have visions that night that show an eagle - representing Jesus - being killed. The Last Supper: The text moves the date of Jesus' Last Supper from Thursday to Tuesday - and suggests it took place with Pontius Pilate . Van den Broek said the Coptic and Ethiopian churches regard Pilate as a saint, which explains the sympathetic portrayal in the text. The text is written in the name of St. Cyril of Jerusalem who lived during the fourth century. Near the beginning of the text, Cyril, or the person writing in his name, claims that a book has been found in Jerusalem showing the writings of the apostles on the life and crucifixion of Jesus. The text reads: 'Listen to me, oh my honored children, and let me tell you something of what we found written in the house of Mary...'. Van den Broek said it's unlikely a book was found in real life and that a claim like this would have been used by the writer 'to enhance the credibility of the peculiar views and uncanonical facts he is about to present by ascribing them to an apostolic source.' Van den Broek added that he is surprised that the writer of the text moved the date of Jesus' Last Supper, with the apostles, and arrest to Tuesday. In fact, in this text, Jesus' actual Last Supper appears to be with Pontius Pilate. In between his arrest and supper with Pilate, he is brought before Caiaphas and Herod. In the canonical texts, the last supper and arrest of Jesus happens on Thursday evening and present-day Christians mark this event with Maundy Thursday services. Van den Broek writes that it 'remains remarkable that Pseudo-Cyril relates the story of Jesus' arrest on Tuesday evening as if the canonical story about his arrest on Thursday evening (which was commemorated each year in the services of Holy Week) did not exist!' About 1,200 years ago the New York text was in the library of the Monastery of St. Michael in the Egyptian desert near present-day al-Hamuli in the western part of the Faiyum. The text says, in translation, that it was a gift from 'archpriest Father Paul', who, 'has provided for this book by his own labors'. The monastery appears to have ceased operations around the early 10th century, and the text was rediscovered in the spring of 1910. In December 1911, it was purchased, along with other texts, by American financier J.P. Morgan. His collections would later be given to the public and are part of the present-day Morgan Library and Museum in New York City. The manuscript is currently displayed as part of the museum's exhibition 'Treasures from the Vault' running through May 5.","The ancient Egyptian text dates back almost 1,200 years .

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 00:19 EST, 12 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:27 EST, 12 March 2013 . A council has been forced to apologise after its contractor mistakenly chopped down a tree planted by school children 30 years ago. The sycamore tree was planted in the centre of the market square in Hadleigh, Suffolk, and was often used for shade by shoppers who would sit on benches beneath its green leaves during hot weather. But the 40-ft tree was accidentally felled by a council contractor who, it has since emerged, should have been simply pruning a different nearby tree. Before: A 40ft sycamore tree planted by school children 30 years ago dominated the market place square in Hadleigh, Suffolk . Babergh District Council has apologised for the blunder and told its contractor he will have to pay for a new tree to be planted. Many shoppers and traders were shocked by the mistake which has left a large hole in the market place. Jane Haylock, of The Idler bookshop, said: 'Everyone in town is talking about it. 'We had been notified that three trees in a row at the back of the market were being pruned, so when I heard the chainsaw I went outside to have a look but it was too late. I was just astounded. 'It was at least 30 years old and Michael Woods, who had just arrived as the headteacher of the community primary school, can remember schoolchildren being pictured at the planting.' The town's mayor, Mary Munson, said: 'I know this tree was looked upon in an affectionate manner but, to be honest, there is nothing we can do about it now and it will be replaced in due course. After: But a council contractor mistakenly chopped down the popular tree instead of simply pruning another one situated nearby . 'It is a very unfortunate accident but the contractor made a genuine mistake.' Elaine Hammond of the Hadleigh Mobility Centre, which is away from where the sycamore once stood, said the tree cannot simply be replaced. She said: 'The tree was a really nice feature of the market place. 'I know that a lot of the stallholders will miss it and of course you can't replicate it with a new one. 'It towered above our two-storey building - people have been coming down here just to have a look at where the tree once stood and where there is now just a space.' A spokeswoman for Babergh District Council said: 'Despite providing the tree contractor with location plans he regrettably, mistakenly felled the wrong tree in Market Place. How it looks now: Babergh District Council has apologised for the mistake and said the contractor will cover the costs of a new tree being planted . 'The contractor had undertaken pruning works to this tree in the past and as this was the only tree visible to him in the area he wrongly thought that this was the tree that was to be felled. 'It was not a case of species misidentification. This is a genuine error on behalf of the contractor who is apologetic for his actions. 'The contractor will be required to remove the stump of the felled tree and supply, and plant a suitable replacement specimen at his own expense. 'It should be noted that the tree in question was identified for future removal as this species will become too large for its location and close proximity to buildings. 'The tree that should have been removed will be felled shortly to provide space for the surrounding trees to grow and that will complete the current works for Hadleigh.'","The sycamore tree was planted in the market square in Hadleigh, Suffolk .
