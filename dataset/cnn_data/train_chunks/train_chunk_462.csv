Planned legislation to attack internet piracy will give the government too much power to close websites, a group of internet founders have warned. A collective of more than 80 of the internet’s creators have claimed a new bill could damage America’s credibility and create ‘fear and uncertainty’. The founders of Google, Twitter, Yahoo! and other major websites have also slammed the Stop Online Piracy Act being . considered in Congress. Worried: Vint Cerf, one of the 'fathers of the internet', is in a group who have claimed the bill could damage U.S. credibility and create 'fear and uncertainty' ‘If enacted, either of these bills will create an environment of tremendous fear and uncertainty for technological innovation,’ the group warned. ‘(They will) seriously harm the credibility of the United States in its role as a steward of key Internet infrastructure,’ they said in a letter, reported AFP. The inventors, engineers and developers are worried about the bill in the House of Representatives - and a Senate version called the Protect IP Act. Their major concern is that U.S. authorities could soon be able to close ‘an incredible range of useful, law-abiding sites’ with the bills. Downloads: The group's major concern is that U.S. authorities could soon be able to close 'an incredible range of useful, law-abiding sites' with the bills . ‘Both bills will risk fragmenting the internet's global domain name system and have other capricious technical consequences,’ the group said.

Vint Cerf, one of the ‘fathers of the internet’, is one of those who signed the open letter to Congress in an attempt to stop the bill happening. The group is worried that the extra censorship being considered could put the U.S. on a par with notorious online policing in China and Iran. But the laws have been backed by the music and film industries, manufacturing groups and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, reported AFP. Unhappy: Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt, pictured, has called the bill 'draconian' and policy counsel Katherine Oyama has also criticised it . Google has been one of the most outspoken opponents of the anti-piracy legislation and has urged lawmakers to think again. It wants politicians to instead work on legislation that cuts off revenue to rogue sites via the courts and avoids any 'collateral damage'. Google’s executive chairman Eric Schmidt has called the bill 'draconian' and the company's policy counsel Katherine Oyama has also criticised it in public. The company, in solidarity with tech giants Yahoo!, Facebook, Twitter, eBay and others, has run full-page advertisements in major newspapers. It also banded with AOL, eBay, Facebook, LinkedIn, Mozilla, Twitter, Yahoo! and Zynga to file a formal complaint in a letter to key lawmakers. Other critics, including website Reddit, launched an effort to combat the proposal by placing 'Stop censorship' titles over their own logos. The Stop Online Piracy Act has pit internet giants, consumer groups and freedom of speech advocates against film studios and record labels. The House bill would allow a private party to go straight to a website's advertising and payment providers and request they sever ties. 'Anyone with an axe to grind could send a notice without first involving law enforcement (or) judicial process,' Google's Katherine Oyama fumed. But advocates of the legislation say current law leaves few options for copyright holders whose products end up on foreign websites. The U.S. Justice Department could also request court orders to compel  search engines and other sites to block domain names or search results.","80 of internet's creators write open letter to Congress .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 12:48 AM on 13th December 2011 . New Canadian citizens must remove any face coverings, such as the Islamic niqab or burqa, while they take the oath of citizenship, the country's immigration minister said today. Jason Kenney said most Canadians find the practice of reciting the oath behind a veil disturbing and said new Canadians should take it in view of their fellow citizens. He said he has received complaints from lawmakers and citizenship judges who say it's difficult to ensure that individuals whose faces are covered are actually reciting the oath. Taking the oath: A woman wearing a headscarf joins fellow new Canadian citizens for the citizenship oath ceremony in Ontario, Canada . The Conservative minister called the issue a matter of deep principle that goes to the heart of Canada's identity and the country's values of openness and equality. He said women who feel obliged to have their faces covered in public often come from a cultural milieu that treats women as property rather than equal human beings . 'I do think that most Canadians find that disquieting to say the least,' Mr Kenney said in a telephone interview. 'Most Muslim Canadian women I know find the practice of face covering in our society disturbing, indicative of an approach to women that is not consistent with our democratic values,' Mr Kenney added. Mr Kenney made the announcement in the French-speaking province of Quebec, which has experienced heated debates over how much Canada should bend to accommodate newcomers. While in the rest of Canada such issues are more often raised by conservatives, in Quebec it's the left-leaning and Parti Quebecois separatists who often discuss it. Controversial: Newcomers receive a certificate of citizenship from a citizenship judge on October 26 . Pride: Three Muslim woman wave their flags during the Canada Day celebration in Vancouver, Canada, where the religion is among the fastest growing . Mr Kenney said his government would not go further by drafting laws to ban women from wearing veils that cover their faces in public. France became the first country to enact a law designed to forbid face-covering veils such as the niqab or burqa anywhere in public. Violators risk fines or being ordered to take citizenship classes. 'We shouldn't have the state using its power to dictate what people choose to wear in their private lives, but when there are important points of intersection with the state in obtaining state services I think it's entirely reasonable for people to show who they are,' Mr Kenney said. There are no laws banning veils or . headscarves in the U.S., though there have been unsuccessful attempts in . some states to ban Sharia law. The sponsor of such a bill in Oklahoma . wanted to prohibit women from wearing headscarves in driver's license . photos. The Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in . 2010 banned veils that obscure the face for security reasons, but later . changed it to accommodate Muslim women. The . burqa is a head-to-toe gown with a mesh-like panel over the face that . allows a woman to see and breathe. The niqab is a veil that leaves only . the eyes exposed. Statement: Kenza Drider (R), candidate for the 2012 French presidential election, wears a niqab as she speaks to the press on December 12 . The new Canadian rule takes effect . immediately. Mr Kenney defended it by saying it has nothing to do with . religious freedom, and said when Muslim women make a pilgrimage to Mecca . they're required to show their face. 'So, the notion that this is somehow a religious obligation, I don't accept,' he said. There are no laws banning veils or headscarves in the U.S. The burqa is a head-to-toe gown with a . mesh-like panel over the face that allows a woman to see and breathe. The niqab is a veil that leaves only the eyes exposed. Both are accepted at swearing in ceremonies in the U.S. There have, however, been unsuccessful attemtps in some states to ban Sharia law, the moral code and religious law of Islam. The sponsor of such a bill in Oklahoma wanted to prohibit women from wearing headscarves in driver's license photos. The Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in 2010 banned veils that obscure the face for security reasons, but later changed it to accommodate Muslim women. Mr Kenney said he raised the issue during a recent meeting of citizenship judges in Ottawa and was told it was a widespread problem. About 940,000 Muslims live in Canada, about 2.8 per cent of the Canadian population. It is the fastest growing religion in Canada. Over the last decade Canada has naturalised between 150,00 and 180,000 new citizens a year. Ihsaan Gardee, the acting executive director of The Canadian Council on American-Islamic Relations Acting Executive, said the decision will have a damaging effect on Canadian democracy because it forces those who wear the veil to choose between their religious convictions and adopting Canadian citizenship. The rule also takes effect as the Supreme Court of Canada hears the case of a woman who wants the right to wear a niqab while facing her accused rapists in court. Mr Kenney said the timing of today's announcement was a coincidence.","New Canadian citizens must remove any face coverings while taking the oath .

Millions of workers are losing out on their pension savings when they move jobs due to complexities in the current system, the Government warned today. Pensions Minister Steve Webb outlined plans to protect the pensions of people who frequently change jobs and help them grow one 'big fat pension pot'. One proposal is to abolish short service refunds for defined contribution occupational schemes, which allow people who switch jobs to get their contributions back, leaving them without the pension. Confusing: Millions are losing out on their pension savings when they move jobs due to complexities in the current system, the Government warned today . The Government wants to strip out red tape that makes it hard for workers to transfer their pensions throughout their careers into one pension. Mr Webb said he wanted to make it as easy as possible for people to 'grow big fat pension pots'. He said: 'I am concerned that people are at risk of losing their small pension pots as they move from job to job. 'I . do not want to see people who are doing the right thing by saving, . ending up with very little for their retirement because the system is . too complicated.

"By . Craig Mackenzie . Last updated at 2:42 PM on 16th December 2011 . The unmanned U.S. spy plane captured by Iran appears to be a fake, a former Pentagon official has claimed. It is the wrong colour and  the welding along the wing . joints does not appear to conform to the stealth design that helps it . avoid radar detection, he said. But U.S. military officials have told CNN the drone was on a surveillance mission of suspected nuclear sites in the country. Scroll down for video . Drone or fake? Iranian military officials examine the craft after putting it on display . Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps flaunted video footage of a downed plane which they claim had 'violated their air space.' on December 4th. They said it was a U.S. bat-winged RQ-170 Sentinel and boasted they guided it down electronically by hacking into its GPS system. But the ex-Pentagon worker, who does not wish to be named, questioned why the landing gear was covered up when displayed by the Iranian military. The drone's underside is obscured with banners that read: 'We'll trample America underfoot' and 'The U.S. cannot do a damn thing.' On Wednesday, state TV reported that data was still be recovered by Iranian engineers from the Sentinel, which is regularly used in stealth missions. The day before, another U.S. drone, the MQ-9, . reportedly crashed at Seychelles International Airport on the island of . Mahe after developing engine problems. Captured: Iran says it will not return the RQ-170 Sentinel reconnaissance drone that crashed in Iran this week . According to the Christian Science Monitor, Iranian scientists guided the RQ-170 to ground by 'spoofing' its GPS coordinates - tricking the plane into landing in Iranian territory instead of where it was programmed to touch down. An article in the Christian Science Monitor quoted an unnamed Iranian engineer who claimed he had been studying the inner workings of the captured RQ-170 Sentinel. He said the 'spoofing' technique made the craft 'land on its own where we wanted it to, without having to crack the remote-control signals and communications' from the U.S. control centre. Monitor writer Scott Peterson and an Iranian journalist publishing under the pen name Payam Faramarzi said the GPS weakness of aircraft has long been known to U.S. military officials. They cited a 2003 report titled GPS Spoofing Countermeasures that appears to warn of the type of attack claimed by the Iranian engineer. 'A more pernicious attack involves feeding the GPS receiver fake GPS signals so that it believes it is located somewhere in space and time that it is not,” says the report. 'This attack is more elegant than jamming because it is surreptitious.' The drone is used for covert surveillance such as the operation to spy on the Pakistan compound of Osama bin Laden before he was killed in a U.S. raid in May. U.S. officials have blamed the loss of the sophisticated spy plane on a malfunction, but have yet to explain how it was in such pristine condition after its recovery by the Iranians. U.S. and NATO officials have said it was on a mission to patrol the Afghan-Iran border and had veered off course when it went missing. Now military officials have told CNN that the Afghan government was unaware of the use of its territory to fly surveillance drones over Iran. The CIA had not informed the Defense Department of the drone's mission when reports first emerged that it had crashed. One official told the station that the U.S. military 'did not have a good understanding of what was going on because it was a CIA mission.' In Kabul, U.S. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta did not deny that it had been spying on Iran and said the drone programme carried out 'important intelligence operations which we will continue to pursue.' The RQ-170 Sentinel is one of the United States' most sophisticated spy planes and flies at up to 50,000 feet. It is designed to evade sophisticated air defenses.  One former intelligence official told CNN that it's 'impossible to see' and discounted Iranian claims that it had been brought down by some form of electronic counter-measures. 'It simply fell into their laps,' he said - after satellite communication was lost. Iranian officials have said the drone came down over eastern Iran, hundreds of miles from the cluster of nuclear sites in the central and north-west of the country. Graphic: The RQ-170 was reportedly used to watch former Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden during the Navy SEAL mission that killed him . They believe they can 'mass produce' the captured drone by 'reverse engineering' the aircraft. Meanwhile, Iranian member of parliament has . hit back at former U.S. vice president Dick Cheney, who said President . Obama should have ordered an airstrike into Iran to destroy the drone . and deny Iranians access to its technology. Kazem . Jalali told ISNA, Iran's state media agency: 'The Islamic Republic of . Iran… can give a crushing response and cut off hands of anyone who wants . to violate its air, navy and land borders.' Cheney said the Iranians will likely 'send (the drone) back in pieces after they've gotten all the intelligence they can out of it.' Panetta said he did not believe Iran would agree to the U.S. request for the drone's return but told Fox News that the stealth missions along the Iran-Afghan border would 'absolutely' continue. He added: 'Our request for return of the drone is an appropriate request,' Panetta said. 'I don't expect that will happen, but I think it's important to make that request.'","Wrong colour and wrong welding on wing joints .

The BBC's flagship children’s show Blue Peter is to be cut to one edition a week and moved to a digital station – with just a repeat  on BBC1. It marks a profound change for the programme, which has been screened on BBC1 first since its launch in 1958. There are currently two editions weekly and at one stage there were three, plus spin-off documentaries. However, viewing figures have slipped in recent years. From January, it will be screened first on digital channel CBBC, with a repeat on the corporation’s main channel the following day. Presenters: Andy Akinwolere, Helen Skelton and Barney Harwood. Blue Peter popularised the phrase 'here's one I made earlier', and children would have to keep a ready supply of toilet roll tubes and sticky-back plastic to hand while watching . The series, which has become a cornerstone of children’s lives for generations, will begin to premiere on the digital station from January 12. Blue Peter is the world's longest-running children's television show first broadcast on October 16 1958. The show lasted for 15 minutes and it was supposed to fill a six week gap in scheduling. The programme is named after the blue and white flag flown on a ship's yard arm to show it was ready to go to sea. The signature tune has always been a hornpipe, originally using variations of Barnacle Bill. On March 2011 it became the first programme in the UK to broadcast an entire show in 360 degrees on the web. The youngest ever presenter was Yvette Fielding who joined the programme at just 18 . F1 champion Lewis Hamilton appears on the programme as a child as did singer James Blunt - then James Blount. Presenter Konnie Huq also appeared in front of the camera . Blue Peter popularised the phrase 'here’s one I made earlier', and for many years children would have to keep a ready supply of toilet roll tubes and sticky-back plastic to hand while watching. It is presented by daredevil Helen Skelton and popular CBBC presenter Barney Harwood, but in recent years has been a launchpad for TV stars such as Matt Baker, Konnie Huq and Anthea Turner. Other famous names who have been given their big breaks over the year have included Valerie Singleton, Janet Ellis, John Noakes and Peter Purves. A spokeswoman for the programme said: . 'The amount of airtime we devote to Blue Peter remains exactly the . same, we are just scheduling it differently. 'It . will still have a regular slot - now all year round - but we’ll have . flexibility to introduce additional specials that will go into more . depth on events and activities.' These . will include a 'Stargazing Live' special next month, and there will be a . nine-part series following Skelton’s trip to the South Pole for Helen’s . South Pole trip. There will also be a series of special shows following . the Olympic torch relay. The show will be screened for the . first time each Thursday, with the BBC1 repeat the following day. It . will get a further airing on CBBC over the weekend. Hey-day: Former Blue Peter presenters Peter Purves, Lesley Judd, Valerie Singleton and John Noakes pictured with dog Shep in 1972 . Richard Bacon when he became the show's presenter aged 21 in 1997 with Romania D'Annunzio (left) Stuart Miles (rear) and Katy Hill . Viewing . for the BBC1 show had been slipping over the years and channel bosses . had increased the emphasis on its digital screenings. A move to a CBBC . premiere had been mooted some months ago. The BBC emphasised that the show would run throughout the year, rather than taking a summer break. At one stage the programme was broadcast three times a week, plus spin-off shows. The show has helped launch the careers of presenters including Matt Baker, top left, and Konnie Huq, bottom left. They are pictured with fellow presenters Liz Barker and Simon Thomas in 2000 . 1. Lulu, the unruly elephant, 1969: The old maxim to never work with children or animals rang true as a baby elephant ran amok in the studio. Lulu first defecated on the studio floor, before standing on presenter John Noakes' foot, then dragged her keeper along the ground before finally the hapless Noakes stepped in the mess Lulu made. 2. Tracy Island, 1993: The most popular 'how-to' guide in Blue Peter history, Anthea Turner's demonstration of building a replica Thunderbirds base using papier-mache and toilet paper tubes garnered 100,000 factsheet requests. Turner still has the Tracy Island she made on the show. 3. The garden is wrecked, 1983: The Blue Peter Garden was vandalised, leaving a generation of children shocked by scenes of trampled vegetation, damage to a plaque made by a handicapped child, and a broken urn. The goldfish in the pond was poisoned. Some years later former Tottenham and England striker Les Ferdinand admitted he 'helped a few people over the wall' but said he did not take part in the vandalism. 4. Richard Bacon gets sacked, 1998: Presenter Richard Bacon was sacked after he admitted taking cocaine. He apologised to viewers via a statement after being exposed by defunct Sunday tabloid paper the News Of The World. Bacon now presents a late night chat show on BBC Radio 5 Live. 5. John Noakes climbs Nelson's Column, 1977: The daring host climbed Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, London, using only a ladder and no safety ropes. Noakes was also famous for his relationship with Blue Peter dog, Shep, who he kept as a pet after leaving the show. Anne Robinson reduced Noakes to tears on quiz show the Weakest Link in 2008 when she asked what had happened to the dog, which died in 1987. 6. Helen Skelton kayaks 2,000 miles down the Amazon, 2010: The daredevil host became the first woman to kayak the length of the Amazon river for Sport Relief. Skelton set off on January 20 near Nauta in Peru, and finished 2,010 miles downstream at Almerim in Brazil. Despite never having been in a kayak before starting training, she paddled around 60 miles a day for six days a week to reach the target, enduring blisters, heatstroke and the sight of wildlife such as anacondas. 7. Andy Akinwolere conquers his fears to break two world records, 2011: Not to be outdone by his co-host Skelton, the brave presenter conquered a crippling fear of open water to set a pair of world records for swimming one of the deepest stretches of water on the planet. The host could barely swim a length a matter of weeks before he swam five miles across the Palau Trench, an 8,000 metre deep abyss in the Pacific Ocean. Akinwolere has not only become the first person to swim across the deepest part of the trench, but he now holds the record for the deepest location for an open water swim.",The show has been screened on BBC1 since its launch in 1958 .
"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 4:49 AM on 16th December 2011 . Google Maps relies on 'landmark' information the search giant has 'bought in' from mapping companies such as TeleAtlas. But a new version of Google's Map Maker lets anyone add landmarks to Google Maps - letting any user add on points of interest, draw on more detailed maps, and even review and delete other people's edits. One of the uses Google showed off for the new version of Map Maker was drawing a 'boundary' round a university - information currently lacking from Google Maps . Google Map Maker is accessible via any web browser, and usable by anyone with a Google account. Google suggests uses such as adding whether a street is one-way - crucial to the sat-nav service it offers on Android phones - and adding details such as lakes to parks, which currently appear as a blank green space. 'Update the actual map as seen by millions of users on Google Maps,' the site promises. You can add places - such as new shops - edit other people's additions, and review other people's edits. Google also approve every edit before it goes live on Google Maps, so towns aren't going to be 'digitally vandalised' by a deluge of unnecessary information. Google's new version of Map Maker will allow any users to add their own landmarks - or even edit other users' landmarks on the site. Google will approve landmarks before they 'go live', though . The underlying information in Google Maps will still also be provided by TeleAtlas, so major landmarks won't be affected. Google says its business relationship with TeleAtlas 'will continue' - although some tech insiders suspect that this move is a prelude to Google building its own 'crowd-sourced' database of information. In response to a question about whether Google would continue to rely on TeleAtlas, a spokesperson said, 'Tele Atlas is a valued partner to Google and they continue to provide us with data for dozens of countries.' Kaushik Sridharan, one of Google's software engineers on their Maps, said in a blog post, 'Today, we’re revealing a new version of Google Map Maker to help users map the places they know best and make their hometowns sparkle on Google Maps.' Google's new version of Map Maker will allow users to 'enrich' the map with their own edits - although Google insists that its business relationship with TeleAtlas, who provide the underlying data in the maps, will not change . 'With Map Maker, you can easily help ensure that the changing world around you is accurately reflected on the map. Add your favorite gift shop, the nearest tree farm, or even the golf course where you once got that hole in one.' 'It’s also easier to mark the best route to Grandma’s house and draw better buildings with courtyards and crisper corners. The options are endless when it comes to mapping the places you know and love.' 'Once approved, your contributions will appear on Google Maps, Google Earth and Google Maps for mobile for all the world to see.' Google pointed to an American high-school student, Tommy Bruce, who has added dozens of American cycle trails to the sites, and said, 'Why not make your New Year’s resolution to improve the map for millions of people?'","'Update the actual map as seen by millions' - Google .

Killer: James Gethen, now 16, was jailed for manslaughter today after admitting killing his mother on the grounds of diminished responsibility . A 15-year-old boy clubbed his mother to death with a baseball bat before calmly walking out of the house and telling a neighbour what he had done, a court heard today. James Gethen said he could 'see her brains' after carrying out the attack. He attacked Ann Gethen, 39, in a fit of rage hours after she announced her engagement on Facebook. The schoolboy had been traumatised by the death of his father eight months earlier and had even tried to jump into his grave, a court heard today. He had a history of violence and killed his mother in a brutal, unprovoked and sustained late-night attack at the family home. His sister Paula, 16, was woken by screams from the living room and when she saw what had happened Gethen told her: ‘I’m not bothered. I hope she’s dead.’ Today Gethen was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection at Leeds Crown Court and must serve at least five years before he can be considered for release. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Mr Justice Openshaw said a psychiatrist concluded the teenager was ‘highly dangerous.’ He called the case ‘dreadful’ and said any thought the defendant’s danger would go away was merely ‘a hope.’ The attack took place at 3am on 15 August last year at the family home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. Murdered: Ann Gethen, 39, was killed by her son in Barnsley. He then calmly walked outside and told his neighbour what he had done . Michael Smith, prosecuting, said the teenager struck his mother over the head several times with the bat and killed her almost instantaneously. There were sobs from the public gallery when the court heard how Gethen, now 16, told a neighbour: ‘I hit my mum round the head with a baseball bat and could see her brains and everything.’ Adrian Waterman, QC, defending, said Gethen suffered a number of psychiatric problems – believed to stem from a bout of meningitis he suffered as a premature baby. He said Gethen had suffered an abnormal bereavement reaction when his father Eric died from cancer in December 2009 and he ‘tried to enter the grave’ when he was buried. Gethen also expressed his wish to be buried alongside him, the court heard. The teenager shared a bed with his sister and lived a ‘complex’ family life in a house  where the attic bedroom was fire-damaged and the windows and front door were boarded up. He had previously displayed ‘sexually abusive behaviour’ towards girls, was expelled from school because of bullying and fighting with other pupils and his school records show ‘episodes of disruptive behaviour and violence on an almost daily basis.’ In one incident he tried to strangle a school friend with a shoelace. His father ‘knew how to sort him out’ and following his death the boy ended up in court for damaging a relative’s home and throwing a brick through a 76-year-old man’s window. When assessed by psychiatrists, the teenager confessed to ‘homicidal ideas’ and ‘unusual images of himself committing homicide.’ Outside court Detective Superintendent James Abdy of South Yorkshire Police said: ‘This was a tragic event and our thoughts are with the family. ‘They have not only had to endure the loss of a loved one but also come to terms with the fact that Ann’s life was cut short at the hands of her own son James.’","James Gethen, 15, calmly walked out of house and told neighbour what he had done .

It’s the posing craze sweeping the U.S. after being brought to fame by skier Lindsey Vonn, soccer star Omar Cummings, baseball player Albert Pujols - and even Republican politician Rick Perry. But now four students at Riverhead High School on Long Island, New York, have been suspended for dropping to a knee and taking up a prayer pose to mimic Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow. Jordan Fulcoly, Wayne Drexel, Tyler Carroll and Connor Carroll were all suspended for one day because the ‘Tebowing’ craze was blocking the hallway and presenting a safety hazard to students. Scroll down for video . Banned: Jordan Fulcoly, Wayne Drexel, Tyler Carroll and Connor Carroll (all pictured left) were all suspended for one day by Riverhead High School on Long Island, New York, for their tribute to Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow . Issue: Four of the pupils were suspended for one day because they allegedly did not heed to warnings that the 'Tebowing' craze at the school was blocking the hallway and presenting a safety hazard to students . ‘It was basically just a tribute to Tim Tebow,’ Connor, 17, told the New York Post. ‘I just don’t think it’s fair (to suspend us). It was more than a religious thing - it was basically like a moment of silence.’ Around 40 students at Riverhead had been imitating the star quarterback in the school corridors, but school officials said this was delaying students on their way to lessons and presenting a fire hazard. ‘It’s wonderful that our students look up to sports heroes such as Mr Tebow, but we can’t allow students to create unsafe situations in school,’ Superintendent Nancy Carney told Riverhead Patch. Two of the four suspensions were later rescinded because school officials decided those pupils had not been given the same warnings as the other two, reported ESPN New York. Denver Broncos: University of Florida graduate Tebow, 24, has developed a cult following for his late comebacks in NFL games and is well-known for his strong Christian faith, which is behind the 'Tebowing' pose . School: Around 40 students at Riverhead had been imitating the star quarterback in the school corridors, but school officials said this was delaying students on their way to lessons and presenting a fire hazard . ‘It causes a potentially unsafe situation with 1,500 people in the building,’ Principal David Wicks told Newsday, saying if a fire alarm went off ‘they could potentially stop someone from getting to safety’. 'It was basically just a tribute to Tim Tebow. I just don’t think it’s fair. It was more than a religious thing - it was basically like a moment of silence' Connor Carroll . Ms Carney has been receiving ‘hate mail’ since the incident from people who believe ‘Tebowing’ was banned by Principal Wicks for religious discrimination, which was ‘very unsettling’ for her. ‘It's a shame that people out there are so ready to judge when they weren't there to see what happened,’ she told ESPN New York. University of Florida graduate Tebow, 24, has developed a cult following for his late comebacks in NFL games and is well-known for his strong Christian faith, which is behind the ‘Tebowing’ pose.

Other stars: Colorado Rapids forward Omar Cummings poses after scoring a goal against the Columbus Crew during an MLS soccer match in October, in honour of Tim Tebow . Baseball imitation: Albert Pujols of the St. Louis Cardinals celebrates by 'Tebowing' after his side defeated the Texas Rangers 6-2 to win the World Series in Game Seven in October . Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry said at the GOP debate on Thursday night that he wants to make a comeback of his own, stating: ‘I hope I am the Tim Tebow of the Iowa caucuses’. 'It’s wonderful that our students look up to sports heroes such as Mr Tebow, but we can’t allow students to create unsafe situations in school' Superintendent Nancy Carney . Recently-divorced skier Vonn, 27, last week joined the craze that mimics Tebow of NFL team Denver Broncos - and she had asked his brother beforehand if it would be OK to pull off the pose if she won. Before stepping on the top step of the podium at the post-race ceremony to celebrate her 46th World Cup win, she dropped to a knee with her skis in her hand and pulled a ‘Tebow’ move. Out of respect for Tebow she asked his brother, who was at the race, if it would be disrespectful, and he gave her the green light to do it. The two have recently struck up a friendship but deny dating. See video here .","Pose of Denver Broncos NFL quarterback Tim Tebow is sweeping the U.S.

The pilot and his passenger, both aged in their late 30s, were killed instantly when their small Cessna aircraft plummeted out of the sky and nose-dived onto a Mazda hatchback. But the motorist and his three passengers miraculously survived the bizarre smash, which happened yesterday on a busy rush hour road close to the country's capital Pretoria. Tragic: Two men died and three others were injured when a plane crash landed on top of a car in South Africa . Lucky escape: The four people in the car survived the crash, although the pilot and his passenger died instantly . Police spokesman Samuel Kilian said . the car passengers had watched in horror as the plane dropped out of the . sky towards their vehicle. He said: 'The two-seater Cessna aircraft took off on a routine flight just before 6.30pm but very quickly got into trouble. 'It seems the pilot wanted to make an emergency landing on the road but he came down straight onto the car. 'The . driver of the car was concentrating on the road so didn't see anything . until he heard a bang from above as it hit the top of his vehicle. 'Apparently some of the passengers had seen the aircraft coming down rapidly and shouted ""plane"" in the moments before impact. 'Sadly the two people in the plane died at the scene but those in the car escaped with their lives. 'It is something of a miracle that they survived.' Paramedics rushed to the scene of the accident on the busy R55 near the town of Centurion, south of Pretoria. Vanessa Jackson, who works for the private ambulance firm ER24, said the pilot and his passenger were pronounced dead at the scene. She . said: 'When paramedics arrived, the small aircraft was in pieces and . the plane had also crashed into a hatchback that had been travelling on . the road at the time. 'Sadly . both of the occupants of the plane were deceased upon arrival of . paramedics as they had already succumbed to the extensive injuries that . they had sustained. 'There was nothing further that could be done for them.' Bizarre: The collision happened yesterday on a busy road close to Pretoria during rush hour . Paramedics rushed to the scene of the accident on the busy R55 near the town of Centurion, south of Pretoria . Ms Jackson said one of the four men in the car escaped unhurt and the other three suffered minor injuries. All four were treated for shock. She . added: 'The three men who were in the hatchback suffered only minor . injuries and after thorough assessment by paramedics, they decided that . they would leave the scene with private transport and would see further . medical attention at a later stage if it was necessary.' Officials last night launched an investigation into what caused the accident. It is believed the small plane had taken off from a private airstrip near Pretoria to take pictures of the region from the sky. Air accident investigators are looking into what caused the pilot to apparently attempt an emergency landing ahead of last night's accident. The car, a cream Mazda 323, was badly damaged in the smash. Police confirmed the vehicle's windscreen was shattered, roof seriously dented and side smashed. The accident caused the partial closure of the busy road, a secondary route which runs between Pretoria and northern Johannesburg. Officials said it led to tailbacks for 90 minutes after the smash as teams worked to clear the debris from the tarmac.","Light aircraft makes emergency landing on car near Pretoria in South Africa .

My husband sat me in a doorway and that's where I gave birth.' Mrs Plews, who is also the mother of two-year-old Mabel, said a woman named Lucy sat with her while her care worker husband went for help.

A couple who romanticized trains and lived a modern-day adventure by riding railroad cars across the U.S. were killed when a train dumped its load of coal on them at a Florida power plant. Workers discovered the bodies of Christopher Artes, 25, and Medeana Hendershot, 22, this Sunday. Though it’s unclear exactly how the young couple died, officials guess that Mr Artes was buried alive and Ms Hendershot was crushed to death by the weight of the coal. Tragedy: Christopher Artes, 25, (pictured) and his girlfriend Medeana Hendershot, 22, were crushed to death by coal while train-hopping across the country . Sometime over the weekend, the train pulled into the city of Lakeland's power plant in Central Florida. As the rail cars arrive, the bottom opens and cars drop coal several stories below onto a waiting truck. Officials were not sure if the couple was sitting on top of the coal or were riding in an empty car and dropped onto a mound of coal, then hit or buried by another load. Mr Artes died from asphyxiation, meaning he was likely buried alive. Ms Hendershot died from blunt force trauma to her middle section. 'We were always worried about him. He . always made so many bad decisions. If he got an idea and . something looked good to him, he would do it. He was always jumping into . situations. This particular train was one of them. I'm sure they . thought the train would go from one yard to another.' -Susan Artes, mother of Christopher Artes . As a teenager in suburban Maryland, Mr Artes had an illegal and dangerous kind of wanderlust - hitching rides on trains. Over the summer, he fell in love with Ms Hendershot, who shared his passion. They travelled from Georgia to Chicago, then back to Tennessee, with Mr Artes sending his mother pictures along the way. They wanted to spend winter in Florida because it was warm.'If he had to die so young, at least he died at a moment where he was on top of the world,' said Susan Artes, Mr Artes’ mother. Travelling tragedy: The couple was making a trek across the U.S. in freight cars like these . Mr Artes was adopted when he was 5 days old. Growing up, he had dyslexia and other learning disorders, but he was a sweet boy, his mother said. He was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder but didn't like taking his medication. He used drugs and drank, but his mother said he had been clean in recent months. In high school, he embraced the punk rock scene and met some 'traveller kids,' his mother said. He started to dress in black and had a lot of different hair styles and colours. It was then he began climbing aboard freight trains for short trips, either to get around, or for the experience. Grisly: The bodies of Artes and Hendershot were found Sunday in coal by Lakeland Electric power plant workers in central Florida . This summer, with his girlfriend, he embarked on his longest trip yet, with no set plans other than the adventure. Since the invention of the railroad, . people have sought travel and wander along the tracks. During the Great . Depression, people jumped aboard to look for work or because it was the . best way to get to another town. Train riding has always been a risky business. Those seeking to travel from one place to the next face dangers of falling off the car and being jolted or crushed as the train's slack lessons. There is also the danger of the open road - in such sparsely populated areas, robbery is common. The couple wanted to stay in Florida, then return to Maryland for a visit with his family in the spring. 'I don't recommend it and I encourage people not to do it,' said Kevin Rice, of San Luis Obispo, California, who writes about his train hopping adventures from 20 years ago on his website. Mr Rice listed the dangers of riding the rails: falling off the car, getting robbed by a vagrant, being jolted or crushed when the train's slack lessens. 'It was a great deal of fun and adventure but we could have gotten killed,' said Mr Rice, now 43. He said he has heard of many different freight-hopping deaths, but nothing like the case of Mr Artes and Ms Hendershot. Mr Artes' mother said her son had a train-hopping manual, but it was stolen at some point. She described her son as naïve and trusting. When he and Ms Hendershot were in Miami several weeks ago, a trucker with whom they had caught a ride with stole Mr Artes' backpack. 'We were always worried about him. He always made so many bad decisions,' she said. 'If he got an idea and something looked good to him, he would do it. He was always jumping into situations. 'This particular train was one of them. I'm sure they thought the train would go from one yard to another.' Ms Hendershot's family couldn't be located for comment. The last time Mr Artes spoke with his mother was last Saturday. He had been up north. He told his mother he was in Georgia on his way to Florida because the weather up north was too cold. His funeral will likely be next week in Maryland.","Christopher Artes, 25, and Medeana Hendershoot, 22, travelled the country by hitching rides on trains .

Britain will plunge into a far deeper recession next year than previously forecast, according to a gloomy prediction from top economists. But the contraction will not be as painful as for those in the eurozone, including France and Germany, which are struggling to tackle the single currency debt problem. Analysts from Standard Chartered Bank say the UK economy has already started to go into reverse as companies lay off employees and households cope with the spending squeeze. Depressing: The UK economy is already moving backwards as companies are forced to shed workers, according to latest analysis . Painful: The recession will be exacerbated because households will have less money to spend as they cope with the squeeze on finances . And it will continue to stutter through at least half of 2012, shrinking by about 1.3per cent in total, compared to a drop of 1.5per cent in the eurozone countries. But all European nations will be left in the wake of China and India as their economies continue to surge forward. 'There will be a two-speed world where a fragile West contrasts with a resilient East,' Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered, told The Daily Telegraph. 'The UK has already slipped back into recession this quarter. So much so, that growth of only 0.6per cent in 2011 may be followed by a contraction of 1.3per cent in 2012,' he added. Trouble ahead: Standard Chartered's prediction falls in line with the lower GDP contraction shown by this graph . Standard Chartered was recently ranked the most accurate economic forecaster over the past two years in a survey of 350 companies. Meanwhile, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicted the Bank of England would have to pump another £125million into the economy to salvage the recovery. Chancellor George Osborne has warned that if the rest of Europe heads into recession it 'may prove hard to avoid one' in Britain, even though the Uk has opted out of treaty changes to tie European countries closer together.","British economy to shrink by '1.3per cent' next year .

Two men who executed a newlywed British couple on their honeymoon have escaped the death penalty. Avie Howell, 21, and Kaniel Martin, 24, were jailed for life for the murder of newly-weds Dr Catherine Mullany and husband Ben, who were shot dead on the last night of their two-week Caribbean holiday. Dr Mullany and her husband, both, 31, were forced to kneel by their side of the bed then 'executed' in their luxury hotel apartment on the island of Antigua in 2008. Howell and Martin - nicknamed Sample Dan and Demon - were found guilty of murder following a four week trial. Dr Mullany died almost instantly after she was shot in the back of the head during the robbery, Antigua's High Court in St John's heard. Mr Mullany, a student physiotherapist and former soldier and policeman, died a week later after he was flown back to Swansea to be placed on a life-support machine. The following month Martin and Howell were charged with their murders and that of 43-year-old shopkeeper Woneta Anderson. The pair were given three consecutive life sentences for the murders but the judge rejected calls for them to be executed. The trial was told how other holidaymakers at the Coco's Hotel and Resort in Antigua heard screams and gunfire at 5am. Police were called and found Catherine dead and physiotherapist Ben barely alive nearby. He tragically died after being flown home to Britain. A safe in the couple's chalet had been forced open and a small amount of cash taken. The couple were married just two weeks earlier in their parish church in the village of Cilybebyll, near Swansea, South Wales, where they are now buried in the churchyard. A joint statement by their family said: 'We will never be able to comprehend the senseless nature of their deaths, the total disregard shown for human life, and that no remorse has ever been shown. 'Ben and Cath will live in our hearts forever. They made our lives happy beyond measure and enriched every day that they were with us' Hiding in shame: Avie Howell (left) and Kaniel Martin (right) were the given life sentences for the murders . Despite their murders in 2008, the bid to keep Ben and Catherine Mullany's memory alive still shows no sign of slowing down. In . the wake of the killings, their loved ones vowed to carry on the good . work started by Mrs Mullany, a doctor, and her student physiotherapist . husband through a charity set up their name. The . Mullany Fund was launched at the memorial service of the Welsh couple, . and has won the backing of the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, and . Antiguan cricket legend Sir Vivian Richards. It . hopes to widen participation in the field of medicine and physiotherapy . by offering grants to UK students, many of whom are facing sharp rises . in tuition fees. Mr and Mrs . Mullany's family say they have been overwhelmed in the way people - from . those who knew the couple to total strangers - have taken the cause to . their hearts. Hundreds . turned up to a fundraising rugby match in the Swansea Valley last year . despite the tie being cancelled 24 hours in advance. The . charity has also been backed on a number of occasions by professional . rugby sides the Ospreys, Scarlets and Cardiff Blues as well as Premier . League newcomers Swansea City. Horror in paradise: The couple were executed on the last day of their stay at luxury chalet Cocos Hotel . Last May, friends of Mr Mullany's . uncle Michael Meredith joined the 59-year-old father-of-two in a . gruelling 24 hour bike ride from north to south Wales to raise money for . The Mullany Fund. And in September, Catrin Jones from Carmarthen is to swim two kilometres in the cold waters of Strathclyde Loch to raise funds. Mr . Mullany's younger brother Adam said the charity had given him, his . parents and his sister-in-law's family a great deal of comfort. He . said: 'Ben served his country in the army and he was a police officer. He just wanted to help. His whole life had been geared towards his true . calling - becoming a first class physiotherapist . 'Ben's values and optimistic outlook on life will carry on through everyone he ever met and he will be missed forever. 'We can never replace Ben and Cath, but we hope to carry on the good work they had started. 'It's vital that their good work carries on.'

Covered with his . favourite cuddly toys, the tiny coffin of 17-month-old Gabriel Leblonk - . the youngest victim of  the grenade and gun massacre in Belgium - is . wheeled out following a moving funeral ceremony. Tragic Gabriel was shot while in his mother Olivia's arms by crazed gunman . Nordine Amrani who launched the appalling attack on Christmas shopping crowds in . Liege's busy Place Saint Lambert. The 32-year-old convicted criminal, . who was due to marry his long-term girlfriend, used grenades and a . semi-automatic rifle to cause carnage in the Belgian city before turning . a revolver on himself. Harrowing moment: Cuddly toys sit on the tiny coffin coffin of 17 . month-old-Gabriel Leblond, the youngest victim of the shooting and . grenade attack in Liege, Belgium, as it is wheeled out after the . funeral ceremony today . Tragic: Baby Gabriel died at just 17 months after being shot in the back of the head while in his mother's arms . Distraught Olivia . described the terrible moment when she first realised her son had been . shot and how he was finally baptised after doctors had battled for 10 . hours to save his life. She had gone shopping to the Christmas market on Tuesday morning with husband Romuald and their son. She said: 'Romuald . handed me the baby when I got off the bus. So I had him in my arms when . I heard a sound of gunfire followed by flash of light like lightning. 'I looked at my child and his eyes returned my look. I screamed. He had been wounded in the back of the head. She then said: 'My child's eyes were rolled back.' The bullet, from a military style-assault rifle was lodged in her baby’s head near the neck. 'They . could not remove it, it was too risky. They told me he had an hour . left. I warned the family. Everyone came to say goodbye,' she said. Quiet dignity: A silent march took place in Liege to pay tribute to the victims of the attack. Four people were killed and more than 120 were injured in the rampage . Yesterday as Belgium continued its struggle to come to terms . with the killings, thousands took to the streets to join a silent march . and memorial service. Defence . lawyer Jean-Francois Dister said Amrani, a Belgian from a Moroccan . background, was on parole and was due to answer a summons about . allegedly ‘sexually molesting’  a young woman. He is thought to have attacked the unnamed victim after driving alongside her in his van. Its number plate was captured by CCTV. Tragic: Friends and relatives of 15-year-old victim Mehdi Belhadj carry his coffin outside Liege's Bressoux mosque . Five people were killed and at least 130 people wounded when Nourdine Amrani began the attack on a crowded market square . ‘What worried him most was to be . jailed again. According to my client it was a set-up by people who . wanted to harm him. Mr Amrani had a grudge against the law. 'He thought he had been wrongfully convicted.’ After . Tuesday’s attack, the bag Amrani used to carry his haul of weapons was . found to still contain several loaded magazines, as well as a number of . live grenades. An . enquiry has been launched into why he had not been under closer . supervision while on bail after early release from a sentence of nearly . five years. Devastated: The attack brought horror to Belgium's fifth largest city, with crowds of shoppers, many of them children, screaming and running in panic as grenades exploded and shots rang out . United: Crowds took to the streets to show their grief for the victims of the attack . One of Amrani’s numerous previous convictions was for rape, for which he had been given a two-year suspended sentence in 2003. If convicted again for a sex crime, he would have had to serve it. This would have also meant his girlfriend, a nurse called Perrin Balon, finding out about the sex allegations against him. ‘He feared being returned to prison,’said Mr Dister. ‘He called me twice on Monday afternoon and on Tuesday morning about it. Grieving: The mother (C) and father (R) of Gabriel Leblond after the funeral ceremony for 17 months old, one of the victims of the attack . His weapons were confiscated because . of his other criminal offences, yet he managed to obtain a FAL Belgian . assault rifle, grenades and other weapons soon after his release in . October 2010. Belgian’s . notoriously liberal criminal justice system is already facing questions . as to why, in October 2010, the killer had been released from prison . three years early after being convicted of firearms and drug offences. In . 2008 he had been found guilty of keeping 10 complete firearms, and an . astonishing 9,500 gun parts in his flat, along with 2,800 cannabis . plants nearby. On . Tuesday morning, Amrani is thought to have tried to rape the woman . cleaner in his flat, where police had found an arsenal of weapons . including a rocket launcher, AK47 and Kalashnikov. Police said he killed her 'with a . bullet to her head' and then dumped her body in a lock-up shed where he . was growing cannabis plants. Killer: Amrani's lawyer said he carried out the attack because he feared being sent to back to prison for a sex crime. He then left money for Ms Balon, with a note that said: 'Good luck! I love you.' A . police source said: 'The cleaner had been working in a neighbour's . home. It appears that Amrani had invited her into his own flat to . discuss the possibility of cleaning his flat. 'There were signs of a struggle, and it may be that Amrani had tried to rape her. 'Whatever happened, she was undoubtedly his first murder victim on Tuesday morning.' Cedric Visart Bocarme, the Belgian . Attorney General, confirmed that the woman 'would have been murdered by . the killer just before he went to Place Saint-Lambert'. The attack brought horror to Belgium's . fifth largest city, with crowds of shoppers, many of them children, . screaming and running in panic as grenades exploded and shots rang out. Looking: Police pictured searching through Nordine Amrani's apartment . Abdelhadi Amrani, another lawyer who worked for the killer but is not related, said he had grown up in foster homes after being orphaned as a child. ‘I remember a man deeply marked by the loss of his parents,’ said Ms Amrani. ‘He lost his father and mother very early. He was marked by fate. ‘I would add he was a very smart boy, gifted. 'Nordine often spoke of his desire to start a family. He was to be married to a nurse in Liege.’ Commenting on Amrani’s background, Ms Amrani said: ‘He did not feel at all Moroccan. He did not speak a word of Arabic, and was not Muslim. What he said is that he felt like a Belgian. Stopped in his tracks: A body, thought to be gunman Nordine Amrani, lies on the pavement close to a gun and full clips of ammunition. ‘He was crazy about weapons, but as a collector. 'He felt he had not had much luck in life and felt unfairly treated by the courts. 'This was the fed-up cry of a tormented soul – he was estranged from justice, and against society.’ A 17-month-old baby boy called Gabriel became the fourth victim after dying in hospital late on Tuesday night despite undergoing hours of emergency treatment. Gabriel was in the arms of his mother when he was hit by a bullet in the back of the head. The child and his parents were at the bus stop just below the walkway from where Amrani opened fire. Amrani had been due to attend a police interview in the late morning but never showed up. Instead he left his apartment armed with a Belgian-made FN- FAL automatic rifle, a handgun and up to a dozen grenades carried in a backpack. He drove the five-minute journey from his 1930s apartment building the Residence Belvedere and parked his white van in Place St Lambert. He walked on to a raised walkway above a bus stop where lunchtime shoppers were thronging for the opening of a Christmas market. From his 15ft high vantage point he lobbed three hand grenades towards a busy bus shelter before opening fire on the crowd. A 15-year-old boy died instantly while the baby of 17 months and a 17-year-old boy succumbed to their injuries in hospital.",17-month-old Gabriel Leblonk was shot while in his mother's arms .
"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 8:40 AM on 16th December 2011 . Sandusky's new lawyer, who recently joined his defence team, has heaped further controversy on the disgraced Penn State coach. Attorney Karl Rominger tried to explain why Sandusky showered with boys, saying that some of the children helped by his Second Mile charity lacked basic hygiene skills. Rominger told WHTM-TV in Pennsylvania: 'Teaching a person to shower at the age of 12 or 14 sounds strange to some people, but people who work with troubled youth will tell you there are a lot of juvenile delinquents and people who are dependent who have to be taught basic life skills like how to put soap on their body.' Deep water: A second lawyer for Sandusky, Karl Rominger, said he allegedly showered with boys from his charity in Pennsylvania to 'teach them about hygiene' Rominger later told the station that media accounts of his explanations have become 'somewhat exaggerated'. Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach, backed out of a preliminary hearing at the last minute on Tuesday. After . the hearing, another of Sandusky's lawyers Joe Amendola inadvertently . made a mockery of his client's case when he held an impromptu press . conference outside the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Controversy: Former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky's legal team have continued to make questionable statements about the child sex abuse allegations which surround him . Amendola said that the grand jury report outlining the child sex-abuse charges was deeply flawed - including allegations that Penn State coach Mike . McQueary witnessed Sandusky . rape a boy in a campus locker room and that he told this to Joe Paterno. He said to them: 'If you believe this (allegation) then I suggest you dial 1-800-REALITY' Unluckily for Amendola - and Sandusky - it turns out this is the number for a gay-sex phone line with an opening message informing the caller it is the 'hottest place for triple-X action'. Oops: Attorney Joe Amendola speaks outside the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, telling reporters if they believe the accusations they can dial 1-800-REALITY . Interest: Media surround Jerry Sandusky's attorney Joe Amendola, top centre, as he holds an impromptu press conference today, continuing to protest his client's innocence . Officials at a Pennsylvania college say Jerry Sandusky had contact with its football programme last year despite being told he failed a background check when applying to be a volunteer coach. Juniata College spokesman John Wall says Sandusky consulted for the school's former coach during the 2010 season despite the coach being informed Sandusky couldn't be associated with Juniata's program. The college says Sandusky applied to volunteer in May 2010 but was turned down after the background check revealed an investigation by a high school where he'd volunteered. Juniata was not told of the nature of the investigation, which ultimately led to child sex abuse charges. Unnamed players tell the station that Sandusky was active in the programme. 'Get ready for bulging, bursting pleasure,' it continues. The unorthodox lawyer has already been criticised . for the way he has handled the disgraced former coach's case, which . included giving him the green light to do a TV interview with NBC's Bob . Costas and two days of interviews with the New York Times. Amendola insists 67-year-old Sandusky . is not the serial predator described by the grand jury and said that . though his methods may be unorthodox, he has a plan. He said on Saturday: 'I do have a strategy. There is a method . to my madness. This has been a well-thought-out strategy.' The lawyers' blunders will only add to the . assumptions of legal experts, who wonder small-town solo . practitioners have taken on more than they can handle. Sandusky's decision to waive the . preliminary hearing came as a shock, as Amendola previously said this . was not an option, believing it to be an 'important opportunity for him . to maintain his innocence'. Shortly after arriving at a packed . Centre County courthouse at 8am on Tuesday, he and Amendola and second attorney . Karl Rominger, joined two prosecutors and a court reporter in the . judge's chambers. After Magistrate Judge Robert Scott asked Sandusky if he understood he was waiving certain rights, the former coach said yes. According to ABC, Sandusky briefly paused outside the courthouse afterwards and said: 'We fully intend to put together the best possible defense that we can do, to stay the course, to fight for four quarters... We want the opportunity to present our side.' When a reporter shouted to him: 'Sandusky, do you still maintain your innocence?', his attorney answered for him saying: 'Yes.' Unbearable: Ben Andreozzi, an attorney for victim number four, holds a handwritten letter from his client, which told of going through 'the most difficult time of his life' Leaving: Jerry Sandusky and his wife Dottie sit in a car after departing from a hearing where he waived the right to have a preliminary trial . Following the decision, Harrisburg attorney Ben Andreozzi read a statement from his client, who is known as Victim Four which said: 'This is the most difficult time of my life. I can't put into words how unbearable this has been on my life, both physically and mentally. 'I can't believe they put us through this only to waive the hearing. Regardless of the decision to waive the hearing, nothing has changed. I still will stand my ground and testify the truth.' Andreozzi told Penn Live the word 'truth' was underlined three times by his client, who would have been the first testify on Tuesday but was only told of the decision at 8.30am. The hearing was expected to last a . day or more. Sandusky has denied the allegations, which led to the . departures of longtime Penn State football coach Joe Paterno and the . university president. 'This development we believe provides . maximum protection to most importantly the victims in this case,' said . Senior Deputy Attorney General E. Marc Costanzo. 'It avoids their having . to testify for a second time. They will of course testify at a trial in . the case.' Judgement day: Wearing a dark suit and with his wife Dottie by his side, he arrived at the courthouse where a judge will decide if the case will go to trial . Attorney: Joe Amendola, right, talks to reporters after a preliminary hearing to determine if there was enough evidence to hold Sandusky for trial on charges of sexually abusing boys . Statement: Jerry Sandusky himself told reporters afterwards: 'We fully intend to put together the best possible defense that we can do, to stay the course, to fight for four quarters...We want the opportunity to present our side' Costanzo said the amount of publicity . generated by Sandusky's attorney made the decision unexpected, but said . the decision to waive was not unusual given the strength of the state's . case. There have been no discussions about a . plea bargain, Costanzo said. Sandusky's next court appearance, an . arraignment, is scheduled for January 11. He remains under house arrest. Michael Boni, a lawyer for one of the . accusers, said he was encouraged by the development. The accusers 'do . not have to relive the horrors they experience up on the witness stand' by having to testify at the hearing and at trial. He . also said it may pave the way for a plea deal somewhere down the road . but the prosecution said that was not even discussed today. Sandusky, in a dark suit, entered the county courthouse through the back door this morning with his wife, Dottie, at his side. He looked straight ahead, ignoring questions from reporters. Defense attorney Joseph Amendola followed him into the courthouse. About 50 members of the media and 10 local residents, a few of them waiting with cameras to take pictures, awaited his arrival. Witnesses have contended before the . grand jury that Sandusky committed a range of sexual offenses against . boys as young as 10, assaulting them in hotel swimming pools, the . basement of his home in State College and in the locker room showers at . Penn State, where the 67-year-old former assistant football coach once . built a national reputation as a defensive mastermind. Pictured: Sandusky's mugshot after he was arrested for a second time on December 7, left, and arriving at court on Tuesday with his wife Dottie by his side, right . Repeat: Sandusky was arrested and jailed on December 6 on new child sex abuse charges brought by two new accusers, including one who claims Sandusky molested him numerous times in a basement bedroom . The scandal has provoked strong . criticism that Penn State officials didn't do enough to stop Sandusky, . and prompted the departures of Hall of Fame football coach Joe Paterno . and the school's longtime president, Graham Spanier. Sandusky, . 67, has said repeatedly that he is innocent and has vowed to fight the . case. In interviews with NBC and The New York Times, he said he showered . and 'horsed around' with boys but never sexually abused them. Sandusky is free on $250,000 bail, but is subject to electronic monitoring and the equivalent of house arrest. He also can have no contact with victims or witnesses and have no unsupervised contact with minors. Last month Mr Sandusky told NBC's Bob Costas and The New York Times that his relationship to the boys who said he abused them was like that of an extended family. Mr Sandusky characterized his experiences with the children as 'precious times' and said the physical aspect of the relationships 'just happened that way' and didn't involve abuse. If the accusers stay true to what was in the grand jury report, the court will hear that Sandusky often showered with them, put his hand on their legs during car rides, and showered them with presents, attention and trips to football games. His advances allegedly ranged from soapy bear hugs in the shower to rape in his basement during sleepovers. He admits showering with them but denies sexual contact.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 6:34 PM on 14th December 2011 . Distinction: Time says its 'Person of the Year' is reshaping global politics . 'The protester' has been named Time magazine's 'Person of the Year' for 2011. The selection was announced today on NBC's Today Show. The magazine cited dissent across the Middle East that spread to Europe and the U.S., and said these protesters are reshaping global politics. The runner-up for the distinction included Admiral William H. McRaven, who organized the raid that led to Osama bin Laden’s death in May. Also considered were Chinese conceptual artist Ali Wei Wei,  Wisconsin Rep Paul Ryan and Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton. An online poll by the Today Show showed overwhelming support for former Apple honcho Steve Jobs and Rep Gabrielle Giffords. Last year, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg was given the honour.

Time's 'Person of the Year' is the person or thing that has most influenced the culture and the news during the past year for good or for ill. It’s . confusing to many that Kate Middleton was snubbed by Time for 'Person . of the Year' in spite of her fairy tale wedding, keen fashion sense and . charitable good deeds. The naming of 'protesters' instead . of names like Rep Gabrielle Giffords, SEAL Team 6, Steve Jobs and . the Duchess of Cambridge has left critics trashing the magazine.

The Royal Wedding was watched by about 47 per cent of the world population. As she walked down the aisle on April 29, many were treated to a spectacle not seen since Diana did the same in 1981. Time does, however, feature Middleton in feature piece separate from the 'Person of the Year' piece. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke received the honour in 2009. The 2008 winner was then-President-elect Barack Obama. Speaking of presidents, they often dominate the outcome, from former President George W. Bush to Jimmy Carter and John F. Kennedy. Other previous non-presidential winners have included Bono, Pope John Paul II, and Amazon.com CEO and founder Jeff Bezos. Controversial winners in the past . have ranged from Adolf Hitler in 1938 to Joseph Stalin, who was named . Person of the Year in 1939 and 1942. Former U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt is the only 'Person of the Year' to win the title three times. Time said it is recognizing protesters because they are 'redefining people power' around the world. Time managing editor Rick Stengel told the Today show; 'There was a lot of consensus among our people. It felt right.' The 'Person of the Year' mention began in 1927, when the magazine named legendary pilot Charles Lindbergh as the first recipient of the honor. Runner-up: Admiral William H.

"Manning's defence demanded that the investigating officer steps down on the grounds of bias . The 24-year-old is accused of leaking material that included hundreds of thousands of sensitive items such as Iraq and Afghanistan war logs . Manning's supporters campaign outside the court in Maryland carrying signs calling for his release . By . Associated Press . Last updated at 12:40 AM on 18th December 2011 . Accused: Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, left, appeared in court yesterday, 18 months after his arrest . The trial of the American soldier . alleged to have leaked vast numbers of classified documents  to . Wikileaks finally got under way yesterday after the failure of a . last-minute legal move. The trial at the huge Fort Meade Army . Base in Maryland, where the U.S. National Security Agency is based, is . expected to last until Christmas Eve. Private Bradley Manning, who has a . Welsh mother and spent part of his childhood in Britain, could be jailed . for life if he is found guilty. The 23-year-old looked frail as he made . an appearance having been in custody for 19 months. He will give . evidence during the week. The young soldier's defense immediately turned fire against the investigating officer - claiming the proceedings were biased against Manning, the accused source for the WikiLeaks website's trove of U.S. military and diplomatic secrets. His lawyer, David Coombs, demanded that the investigating officer, Lt Colonel Paul Almanza, recuse himself from the case on the grounds that he works as a prosecutor for the US department of justice. The DoJ is involved in a criminal pursuit of Julian Assange, founder of the whistle blowing website WikiLeaks, to which Manning is alleged to have transferred a huge trove of US embassy cables and other confidential materials. The court-martial hearing may hinge on whether the U.S. government over-zealously stamped 'secret' on material posing no national security risk. Almanza, rejected a defense request that he step aside because of alleged bias. He then refused to suspend the hearing while an Army appellate process weighed an appeal. Manning, appearing slight but serious in his Army camouflage fatigues and dark-rimmed glasses, looked on quietly. On the day before his 24th birthday, he took notes during the proceedings at this Army post between Washington and Baltimore, sometimes twirling a pen in his fingers and answering straightforwardly when called upon by Almanza. 'Yes, sir,' Manning responded when asked if he understood the charges against him. 'No, sir,' he said when questioned if he had any questions about them. The prosecution will begin presenting its case Saturday. Manning, a one-time intelligence analyst stationed in Baghdad, is accused of leaking material that included hundreds of thousands of sensitive items: Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, State Department cables and a classified military video of a 2007 American helicopter attack in Iraq that killed 11 men, including a Reuters news photographer and his driver. The Obama administration says the released information threatened valuable military and diplomatic sources and strained America's relations with other governments. Turning the guns: The young soldier's lawyer immediately turned fire against the investigating officer - claiming the proceedings were biased against Manning . Defence: In this courtroom sketch, Bradley Manning, second from left, sits as his attorney, David E. Coombs, demands that the investigating officer, Lt Colonel Paul Almanza, recuse himself from the case . But Manning's defense will argue that much of the information posed no risk. In addition to the question of bias, his lawyer argued that Almanza wrongly denied a defense request to call as witnesses the 'original classification authorities' who decided to mark as secret the material WikiLeaks published. Instead, Almanza accepted unsworn statements from those people, Manning attorney David Coombs said. 'Let's put witnesses on the stand,' Coombs said. ""Why is this stuff classified? Why is it going to cause harm?"" Procedural maneuvering dominated the start to what already was an arcane military justice process. The hearing in Fort Meade was open to the public, with limited seating, and no civilian recording equipment was allowed. Instead of a judge, a presiding officer will deliver a recommendation whether prosecutors have enough evidence to bring a suspect to trial. A military commander then makes the final decision. Protest: Supporters of U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning hold a vigil outside the gates of U.S. Army Fort George G. Meade in Maryland where Manning's preliminary hearing is being held . Supporters: Simon Beckford (C) protests outside the opening of the pre-trial hearing of WikiLeaks suspect Bradley Manning . Pro-Manning: About 50 protesters assembled outside the Army post's main entrance and a few dozen marched down an adjoining road carrying signs that read, The Bradley Manning Support Network . The tangling centered on whether Almanza, an Army Reserve lieutenant colonel, is biased because of his civilian job as a Justice Department prosecutor. ""I don't believe I'm biased,"" Almanza said, explaining that his government work concerns child exploitation and obscenity. He said he hasn't talked about WikiLeaks or Manning with anyone in the Justice Department or FBI. Coombs said he'd ask the Army Court of Criminal Appeals to intervene. It was unclear when the court would decide whether to hear the appeal. The bias charge reflects the Justice Department's separate criminal investigation into WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. A U.S. grand jury is weighing whether to indict Assange on espionage charges, and WikiLeaks is straining under an American financial embargo. Assange is in Britain fighting a Swedish request that he be extradited because of rape allegations. Wikileaks suspect: Former U.S. army intelligence agent, Bradley Manning is suspected by officials of being behind the leaked cables and war reports on whistleblower website Wikileaks . The fates of Manning and Assange may be intertwined, but they have been living under dramatically different circumstances. The Australian-born WikiLeaks chief has been waging his case from a wealthy supporter's country estate in southeastern England; Manning has been detained since May 2010 and spent eight months at a Marine Corps brig in Quantico, Va., confined alone in a cell for 23 hours a day. Earlier this year, the Army sent him to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. Military officials declined to say Friday where they were holding Manning during the trial. The case has spawned an international support network of people who believe the U.S. government has gone too far in seeking to punish Manning, a native of Crescent, Okla., who was a low-level intelligence analyst in Baghdad. He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Manning's supporters planned to maintain a vigil during the hearing and were organizing a rally for Saturday. At midday Friday, about 50 protesters . assembled outside the Army post's main entrance and a few dozen marched . down an adjoining road carrying orange signs that read, 'The Bradley . Manning Support Network.' In cuffs: Wikileaks suspect Bradley Manning, centre, is escorted from his hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland . Detained: A court room sketch shows Army Private Bradley Manning listen as his defense lawyer David Coombs asks presiding officer Army Lt. Col. Paul Almanza to recuse himself from the Article 32 hearing at Fort Meade . The Army filed formal charges against him in March, accusing him of using unauthorized software on government computers to extract classified information, illegally download it and transmit the data for public release by what the Army termed ""the enemy."" WikiLeaks released some 77,000 military records on the war in Afghanistan in July 2010, creating a sensational international media splash and publicizing some unflattering assessments of the U.S military effort. The overall effect was muted, however, and an October 2010 batch of nearly 400,000 documents written mostly by low-ranking officers in the field provided little more than a catalogue of thousands of battles with insurgents and roadside bomb attacks, plus equipment failures and shootings by civilian contractors dating back to 2004. A month later, WikiLeaks released hundreds of thousands of State Department documents, including candid comments from world leaders. Almanza is likely to make his recommendation on whether to court-martial Manning within eight days of the hearing's completion, a U.S. military legal expert told reporters. The hearing is expected to last through the weekend and possibly well into next week. The final decision on a court-martial lies with Army Maj. Gen. Michael S. Linnington, commander of the Military District of Washington. Linnington could choose other courses, including an administrative punishment or dismissing some or all of the charges.","Manning's defence demanded that the investigating officer steps down on the grounds of bias .

"Arizona law enforcer Joe Arpaio condemned for 'discriminatory policing' By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:28 PM on 18th December 2011 . A prisoner was brain dead after being restrained at a jail run by 'America's toughest sheriff' Joe Arpaio, according to a senior police officer. Lieutenant Mike Stauffer, a rival of Arpaio's for county sheriff, wrote on Facebook: 'We received news from an inside source that a Latino inmate at the 4th Avenue Jail is brain dead due to excessive force by detention officers.' Ernest M. Atencio, a 44-year-old Gulf War veteran, was being booked into the jail in Phoenix, when he was Tasered and suffered a heart attack, his family claimed. 'Excessive force': Ernest Atencio, 44, was being held at an Arizona jail run by Sheriff Arpaio when he had to be rushed to hospital and remains on life support . Decorated: Mr Atencio, who served in the first Gulf War, suffers from a mental illness . They told local TV station Channel 5 that he was a 'loving and sweet boy' who suffered from a mental illness and is now fighting for his life. Lt Stauffer also wrote on Facebook that homicide detectives were reviewing video from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO). Mr Atencio was arrested on assault charges on Friday at around 3am. Phoenix Police Department spokesman . Steve Martos told the Phoenix New Times: 'Once he got down to the jail, . there was some kind of scuffle of some sort.' Mr Atencio was put in a cell by himself to calm down, according to MCSO.  Around 15 minutes later, medical staff checked on the 44-year-old and had to begin CPR when he was unresponsive. Under-fire: Sheriff Joe Arpaio is running an office based on blatant racism against Latinos, a scathing U.S. Justice department report has revealed . Blowing the whistle: Scottsdale Police Lieutenant Mike Stauffer posted the allegations of excessive force on his Facebook wall . Mr Atencio was taken to St Joseph’s Hospital in Phoenix and remains in a critical condition. Mr . Atencio's family claim that he was Tasered by police and suffered a . heart attack but was not given proper medical care soon enough. An MCSO spokesman Christopher Hegstrom added in a statement: 'The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office is releasing the name and photo of Ernest M. Atencio D.O.B. 2/22/67 who was arrested by Phoenix Police Thursday night. 'He is at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix. He is listed in Critical Condition at this time.' Last week, the U.S. Justice Department condemned Sheriff Arpaio for committing civil rights violations . against Latinos through his immigration and jail policies. Injured: Mr Atencio's family said these marks were caused by a Taser used on him at the Arizona jail . Latino inmates who didn’t understand commands in English were punished by up to 23 hours a day of solitary confinement, investigators found. Arpaio slammed the . report as a political attack by the Obama administration that will keep . illegal immigrants on the streets of Arizona.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Last updated at 11:01 PM on 17th December 2011 . Prayers were said yesterday to remember tragic Joanna Yeates, a year after she was murdered by her neighbour Vincent Tabak. Visitors to her local church in Bristol also lit candles in her memory and left messages of condolence in a card for her family. The 25-year-old landscape architect was . last seen alive on the night of December 17, 2010, in the Clifton area . of the city. Eight days later her body was found on a snowy verge three . miles away. Notes of condolences: Wellwishers leave messages of support for Joanna Yeates's family at her local church in Clifton, Bristol . Poignant note: A moving tribute from a juror at the trial of her killer was attached to a fresh bunch of flowers left at the verge where her body was found . Rev Paul Langham, from Christ Church, . Clifton, said: ‘Anybody in the community or anybody else who’d like to . come in and be quiet are welcome to perhaps light a candle in Jo’s . memory. ‘We have a card for her parents if . people would like to sign that. It’s a small way of marking this . dreadful day in our community’s history.’ A couple's message said: 'We wanted to express our deepest sympathies to you all at this very sad time of year for you. We lost our own son in an accident ten . years ago. This does not equate with the awful experience you have had . but we understand a little of what you have been going through. Cat lover: Joanna Yeates was strangled by her neighbour Vincent Tabak . 'The sense of loss never goes but we . hope that the pain will slowly ease for you as time passes. Our thoughts . and prayers are with you.' Another moving tribute read: 'Your beautiful . daughter may be gone but Jo is not forgotten in the Clifton community . and our thoughts and prayers are with you at this sad time. 'May you know . God's peace, love and comfort always.' One couple at the church wrote:  ‘We . wanted to express our deepest sympathies to you all at this very sad . time of year for you. The sense of loss never goes but we hope that the . pain will ease for you as time passes.’ Miss Yeates’s body was found by dog walkers on Christmas morning  in Failand, North Somerset. She had been strangled. Yesterday, a bunch of flowers was . left at the scene. A message with the flowers was signed ‘A juror’, . prompting speculation that it was from one of the 12 jurors who had . tried Tabak. It read: ‘Joanna, one year ago I . didn’t know you. Sadly one year on and I shall never know the person I . came to wish I had known.’ Tabak, 33, a Dutch . engineer, was convicted of the 25-year-old's murder in October and . jailed for life. He will serve a minimum 20 years' imprisonment. During his trial at Bristol Crown . Court, the jury heard he strangled Miss Yeates in a violent . confrontation at the flat she shared with boyfriend Greg Reardon in . Canynge Road, Clifton. He then spun a web of lies and deceit . to cover his tracks - taking her body back to his flat, then going night . shopping in Asda with the body in his car boot. Within an hour he had dumped her . partially clothed corpse on the verge, and just 24 hours later was . drinking champagne with friends. Tribute: Wellwishers in the community wrote messages for the family one year after Joanna was murdered by her next-door neighbour . Heartfelt: Messages of support a year after the murder which shocked the local community in Clifton, Bristol . The court heard that Tabak was obsessed with images of women being strangled during sex. Earlier this week, Mr Reardon spoke of his pain at losing the love of his life and said they would probably have married one day. Killer: Vincent Tabak was obsessed with images of women being stranglled . He said:'The thought of proposing had crossed my mind although it was probably some time off. 'It was more about taking things one step at a time and seeing where life took us than having a 'five-year plan' or whatever. 'I've visited her grave and will continue to do so. We are in the process of organising a proper headstone and it will be nice to see that in place. 'I'm not sure specifically what I'll do to remember Jo in the future but I'm certainly not going to forget her.' Miss Yeates's father, David, 63, said he and his family continued to struggle with their loss. 'Our lives go on and we still have to deal with the fact that Jo is no longer around,' he told BBC South. 'She . loved Christmas - that was her best time of the year. She loved playing . games, cards and being competitive. She enjoyed the whole razzmatazz to . do with Christmas. 'That's why being found on Christmas Day was so poignant.' Mr . Reardon told The Sun he met Miss Yeates in 2008 after they both . started working for the BDP architecture firm in Bristol, and described . her as modest, conscientious and laid-back. He . said the couple had lived together for over a year and had a pet cat, . adding: 'My mum and dad were very proud of me for finding such a nice . girl.' Mr Reardon was visiting his brother in Sheffield when Tabak murdered her in their home. Couple: Joanna Yeates and her boyfriend Greg Reardon. He planned to marry her . The 28-year-old was praised, along with Miss Yeates's family, by police for his dignity during Tabak's trial. He told The Sun: 'The trial was a bloody nightmare, but we all had to grit our teeth and ride it through. It was surreal facing Tabak in court. I just had to keep calm and get through it. 'After the trial was over I felt a big release of tension but it just left me a little numb and empty. I was glad of the result, though.'","Candles are lit for tragic daughter strangled last Christmas .

"Sarah Mason, 25, spotted in a line of activists at Occupy LA . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:28 PM on 18th December 2011 . Her face has become the symbol of a year of protests that stretched from downtown Manhattan to Cairo's Tahrir Square. After being featured on the cover of TIME magazine as 'person of the year', it was only a matter of time before the identity of the Protester was revealed. Sarah Mason, 25, has had fame thrust upon her after her image at an Occupy LA protest ended up on the front page. Unmasked: TIME magazine used the image of Sarah Mason, a 25-year-old protester at Occupy LA, for its cover of the year . Her distinctive yellow bobble hat, defiant glare and 99% scarf stood out to photographer Ted Soqui who snapped the picture for LA Weekly. It was transformed into the artistic cover by LA street artist Shepard Fairey. Miss Mason, who has gone completely underground since the cover emerged, was pictured linking  arms in a circle during a protest at the Bank of America Plaza on November 17. She was arrested by riot police at the end of the day for failing to leave the square. The young woman, who works in an art gallery, had soaked her bandana in vinegar 'just in case the police sprayed them with gas or pepper spray', according to LA Weekly. Miss Mason was pictured on an international day of action for the Occupy movement. On the same day in New York, more than a thousand protesters gathered near the New York Stock Exchange chanting 'All day, all week, shut down Wall Street'. Several thousands more crammed into Manhattan's Foley Square and marched to the Brooklyn Bridge. Relentless: Another protest springs up in Los Angeles earlier this month as demonstrators bring their cause to the federal building . American spirit: The Occupy movement regrouped yesterday in Duarte Square, New York . Sarah Mason became involved in Occupy LA after struggling with her own personal debt when she left Northern Arizona University. She . told 360 magazine: 'I think the Occupy Wall Street Movement has shown . that a lot of attention has been going to the fact that students have . made an investment in their educations, then they come to the real world . and they realize that that investment is essentially worthless.' 'Students have . made an investment in their educations, then they come to the real world . and they realize that that investment is essentially worthless.' Sarah Mason, 'The Protester' Occupy LA was cleared two weeks after NYPD evicted protesters from Zuccotti Park in Manhattan. More than 200 people were arrested at the camp in California as 1,000 riot police stormed the site and cleared the tents. The runner-up for the distinction of Time's person of the year included Admiral William H. McRaven, who organised the Navy SEALS raid that led to Osama bin Laden’s death in May. Also considered were Chinese conceptual artist Ali Wei Wei, Wisconsin Rep Paul Ryan and Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton. An online poll by the Today Show showed overwhelming support for former Apple honcho Steve Jobs and Rep Gabrielle Giffords.","Sarah Mason, 25, spotted in a line of activists at Occupy LA ."
"By . Tom Kelly . Last updated at 6:35 PM on 18th December 2011 . Stores enjoyed their busiest weekend of the year as millions of shoppers finally came out to snap up cut price deals after months of disappointing sales. Queues formed outside some shopping centres ahead of opening times today and an estimated £1billion was spent on Saturday alone. But experts warned that retailers still faced an 'austerity Christmas' with profits down on last year and a likely 'High Street bloodbath' in January with up to 3,000 stores facing closure. Crowds: London's Oxford Street will see around a million shoppers pay a visit during 'Panic Saturday', the busiest shopping day of the year . Bargain hunters: Crowds of last-minute shoppers descend on Northumberland Street in Newcastle today to snap up presents . Packed: The escalators look busy at the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham on the last weekend before Christmas . They suggested that because so many . cut-price deals had been needed to lure customers, the heavy footfall . would not necessarily translate into large profits. Around 11 million shoppers spent up to . £1.5 million a minute after much of the country left buying presents to . the final full weekend before Christmas. Capital Shopping Centres, which owns . Glasgow's Braehead, Gateshead's Metrocentre, Cardiff's St David's, . Manchester's Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Thurrock, said its 14 sites . had been 'packed' throughout Saturday and Sunday. John Lewis also reported record sales . of £133.1 million in the week to Saturday, which was 10.6 per cent . higher than a year ago, and the highest weekly figure it has ever . achieved. Most consumers were attracted by a . raft of bargains, with women's clothes store Jigsaw offering 30 per cent . party wear and half price Scalextric sets available at Modelzone. Others defied the economic downturn to . splash out on expensive items, with Selfridges reporting a surge in . sales in  Van Clef and Cartier diamond necklaces and luxury watches. Deals: Shoppers cram New Street in the centre of Birmingham as they browse high street shops and the Frankfurt Market . Enlarge . Christmas shoppers in Liverpool, on what is expected to be one of the busiest shopping days of the year . Christmas shoppers at Derby city centre . There were long queues in the Bullring, Birmingham, as more than 320,000 people packed the shopping centre to get last-minute Christmas bargains. Famed for its bronze bull outside and silver snake skinned exterior, escalators and aisles in the three-storey complex were jammed with shoppers. Stores in the centre have reported a business boom in the run up to Christmas, with opening hours extended to cope with extra demand. Tim Walley, general manager at Bullring, said: 'We saw in the region of 200,000 shoppers visit the centre yesterday. 'With pay day coming early we expected shoppers to come out in their thousands today as they pick up their last few Christmas presents, and they have. 'Top selling gifts have included Chanel Coco Mademoiselle beauty sets for women at Selfridges and a return to the iconic Levi 501 jeans. 'We expect to see a further 120,000 shoppers visit the centre today.' But despite the rammed shopping . centres and high streets, the Centre for Economics and Business Research . predicted that overall sales in December would be down 1.7 per cent . compared to November, and 0.3 per cent lower than a year ago. Chief executive Douglas McWilliams said that consumer confidence was 'shot to pieces' amid the economic gloom. He said: 'Retailers are in for an . austerity Christmas. 'Those who have left their Christmas shopping late . can expect bargains aplenty both before and after Christmas Day because . retailers are working hard to shift excess stock and justify town-centre . overheads going forward.' A spokeswoman British Retail . Consortium said: 'This was a make or break weekend for many retailers . who were hoping for a big turnout after a disappointing few months. 'It does appear that large numbers . went to the shops and that this was probably the busiest shopping . weekend of the year, but it is too early yet to say whether this has . translated into significant profits. 'Stores put on so many cut price deals to attract consumers that profit margins will inevitably have been squeezed.' Shops have been forced to introduce big reductions on products to get customers through the door . Tidy: Shoppers in Swansea City Centre on the look out for a few last-minute presents . Retail analyst Jonathan De Mello, from . the CB Richard Ellis consultancy, warned that up to 30,000 shop workers . could lose their jobs at the end of Christmas as a swathe of small . independent retailers and some major high street names are forced to . close as banks call in heavy debts. It is the most gloomy prediction since . Christmas 2008, when the UK economy was at its worst point since the . start of the downturn. Currently 15 per cent of shops in Britain are . vacant. This is expected to rise by 1 per cent by the end of festive . period, he said. This would lead to around 3,000 shops closing and between 20,000 to 30,000 workers being laid off. Mr De Mello said: 'The country is . facing a High Street bloodbath immediately after Christmas which will . have a devastating impact on shopworkers and other businesses that . supply shops. 'It is unlikely that retailers will survive the next rental quarter unscathed. 'Whilst the economy is not officially . back in recession as yet, we are very much in a retail recession. 'Whilst banks may be willing to let some of these retailers trade . through Christmas, when the majority of profit is delivered for most . retailers, those that struggle over the Christmas period may find the . banks pulling the plug on them, and this could well include a couple of . big high street names. 'The government needs to act soon not . just to attempt to save small town centres that are potentially in . terminal decline anyway, but to protect some of the larger retail chains . that are clearly very vulnerable at the moment.' More than 11 million people are expected to spend more than £1 billion at £1.5 million a minute, according to a report by shopping comparison website Kelkoo .","Shopping centres across the UK bustling as bargain hunters hit the shops .

"By . Katie Nicholl  and Christopher Leake . Last updated at 5:47 PM on 18th December 2011 . Prince Harry became embroiled in a real-life crime drama when he came to the rescue of one of his best friends after he was mugged on a London street. According to police records, the Prince was on the phone to Thomas van Straubenzee at the exact moment a robber took his friend’s BlackBerry mobile. Harry heard the scuffle taking place and immediately drove to the scene with his protection officer. Fearing 28-year-old Mr van Straubenzee had been hurt, the Prince circled the streets of Battersea, South-West London, looking for him. Scuffle: The Prince . was on the phone to Thomas van Straubenzee at the exact moment a robber . took his friend’s BlackBerry mobile . When he could not find his friend, he  drove to the nearest police station where he found Mr van Straubenzee reporting the crime. Because he had overheard the mugging taking place, Prince Harry was required to give a police statement, which is now part of an ongoing investigation. Last night, Wandsworth police told The Mail on Sunday that they had arrested a man in connection with the robbery and recovered the stolen mobile phone. The man was released on bail. It is believed to be the first time a senior Royal has walked into a police station to report a crime. Royal witness: The police station where Harry went to report the crime . A police source said: ‘Prince Harry came into the station to give a statement. It was a separate statement from the one given by his friend who was mugged.’ A police spokesman said: ‘Police are . investigating an allegation of personal robbery which occurred at . approximately 8.30pm on Wednesday, November 30, in Albert Bridge Road, . SW11. ‘A mobile phone was . taken during the robbery. This allegation was taken seriously,  as are . all allegations of robbery. A man was arrested on Thursday, December 1 . on  suspicion of robbery and bailed to return in January pending further . inquiries. Police from Wandsworth are investigating.’ An . aide told The Mail on Sunday how Harry, who is believed to have been at . Clarence House, his London residence, leapt into action after their . conversation came to an abrupt end. ‘Prince Harry was aware of what had . happened to his friend and drove to the area immediately to try to find . him,’ the aide said. ‘He . circled the streets for a while in his car before following intuition . and finding his friend at a local police station in Battersea Bridge . Road. The Prince wanted to be there to offer some comfort and friendly . support. ‘Prince Harry . made his way to the station and by the time he arrived the police had . already enacted a number of operational procedures, which involved very . swift action and the kind of scenes you see on The Bill. Both the Prince . and his friend were very grateful to the police for how they handled . it.’ The 27-year-old . Prince, who has recently returned to the UK from America where he has . been completing the final stages of his Apache helicopter training . course, took Mr van Straubenzee home, then returned to Clarence House . with his protection officer. The . Prince and Mr van Straubenzee are childhood friends and attended . Ludgrove school in Berkshire and Eton together. Mr van Straubenzee is . also a close friend of Prince William and was one of his ushers at his . wedding. Nicknamed ‘Van’ by his friends, the 28-year-old accompanied Prince William on his first . official tour  to New Zealand in 2005 and is a  regular guest at William . and Kate’s Anglesey home. Both . Princes are also close to Tom’s parents, Alex and Claire van . Straubenzee, who live at their family’s estate in Grantham, . Lincolnshire, and are patrons of a memorial fund dedicated to Tom’s . brother Henry, who was killed in a car crash in 2002. Old friends: Thomas jokes around with William, Harry and his girlfriend of the time Chelsy Davy at the concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium in 2007 . The fund raises money to help schoolchildren in Uganda. The Dutch-descended Van Straubenzees have a long history with the Royal Family and have served the British Crown for at least 150 years. Alex van Straubenzee is a former officer in the Royal Green Jackets, a regiment since merged into  The Rifles. William and Harry socialise frequently with Tom and his younger brother Charlie. Just weeks ago, Prince Harry attended a party for the Van Straubenzee memorial fund, and the friends regularly shoot together. Clarence House last night confirmed the mugging but said they could not comment on whether Prince Harry was speaking to Mr van Straubenzee at the time he was mugged because the police investigation is ongoing. A spokesman for Prince Harry said: ‘Prince Harry joined a friend  at a police station in South London after his friend had reported a  robbery. By the time Prince Harry arrived to be with his friend, the police investigation into the incident had already begun. ‘The investigation is ongoing, so we cannot comment further.’ Wealthy Battersea has become a crime hotspot for muggings, murders  and drug-dealing.Rich residents have become targets of robberies, often committed by street gangs in the area – a stone’s throw across the Thames from exclusive Chelsea. Last month Richard Ward, 37, died from massive head injuries after being set upon in an unprovoked gang attack. In February, Niall Hall, a former aide  to the Queen Mother, was carjacked and kidnapped by a gang who stripped him naked and ran knives along his body. Danger spot: The road where Thomas van Straubenzee was attacked . Mr Hall, 49, was forced to reveal his bank card PIN numbers, and his valuable watch and cash were stolen. He had to be treated for bleeding in the brain. Four men recently went on trial in connection with the attack. A fifth man has pleaded guilty. In the same month, firefighter’s wife Anna Smith, 33, suffered a severe beating from thugs in the area after she fought to save a female neighbour from being mugged. One of the most horrific crimes in Battersea was the murder in 2002 of local estate agent Tim Robinson. Dwaine Williams was jailed for life after stabbing Mr Robinson, 25, in front of his girlfriend to get his £20,000 Audi Quattro. In 2007, drug addict Elmi Said Elmi was jailed for three-and-a-half years for setting his Staffordshire bull terrier on people to steal their mobiles and cash.","Thomas van Straubenzee, 28, was robbed in Battersea at 8.30pm .

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 10:10 PM on 13th December 2011 . Jerry Sandusky's blunder-prone lawyer inadvertently made a mockery of his client's case today when he held an impromptu press conference outside the courthouse after the decision was made to waive the hearing. Joe Amendola told reporters outside the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, that the grand jury report outlining the child sex-abuse charges was deeply flawed - including allegations that Penn State coach Mike . McQueary witnessed Sandusky . rape a boy in a campus locker room and that he told this to Joe Paterno. He said to them: 'If you believe this (allegation) then I suggest you dial 1-800-REALITY' Unluckily for Joe Amendola - and Sandusky - it turns out this is the number for a gay-sex phone line with an opening message informing the caller it is the 'hottest place for triple-X action'. Scroll down for video . Confront: Former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky arrives for a preliminary hearing at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, this morning where he will face his accusers . Oops: Attorney Joe Amendola speaks outside the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, telling reporters if they believe the accusations they can dial 1-800-REALITY . Interest: Media surround Jerry Sandusky's attorney Joe Amendola, top centre, as he holds an impromptu press conference today, continuing to protest his client's innocence . Officials at a Pennsylvania college say Jerry Sandusky had contact with its football programme last year despite being told he failed a background check when applying to be a volunteer coach. Juniata College spokesman John Wall says Sandusky consulted for the school's former coach during the 2010 season despite the coach being informed Sandusky couldn't be associated with Juniata's program. The college says Sandusky applied to volunteer in May 2010 but was turned down after the background check revealed an investigation by a high school where he'd volunteered. Juniata was not told of the nature of the investigation, which ultimately led to child sex abuse charges. Unnamed players tell the station that Sandusky was active in the programme. 'Get ready for bulging, bursting pleasure,' it continues. The unorthodox lawyer has already been criticised . for the way he has handled the disgraced former coach's case, which . included giving him the green light to do a TV interview with NBC's Bob . Costas and two days of interviews with the New York Times. Amendola insists 67-year-old Sandusky . is not the serial predator described by the grand jury and said that . though his methods may be unorthodox, he has a plan. He said on Saturday: 'I do have a strategy. There is a method . to my madness. This has been a well-thought-out strategy.' Today's blunder will only add to the . assumptions of legal experts, who wonder if the small-town solo . practitioner has taken on more than he can handle. Sandusky's decision to waive the . preliminary hearing came as a shock, as Amendola previously said this . was not an option, believing it to be an 'important opportunity for him . to maintain his innocence'. Shortly after arriving at a packed . Centre County courthouse at 8am, he and Amendola and second attorney . Karl Rominger, joined two prosecutors and a court reporter in the . judge's chambers. After Magistrate Judge Robert Scott asked Sandusky if he understood he was waiving certain rights, the former coach said yes. According to ABC, Sandusky briefly paused outside the courthouse afterwards and said: 'We fully intend to put together the best possible defense that we can do, to stay the course, to fight for four quarters... We want the opportunity to present our side.' When a reporter shouted to him: 'Sandusky, do you still maintain your innocence?', his attorney answered for him saying: 'Yes.' Unbearable: Ben Andreozzi, an attorney for victim number four, holds a handwritten letter from his client, which told of going through 'the most difficult time of his life' Leaving: Jerry Sandusky and his wife Dottie sit in a car after departing from a hearing where he waived the right to have a preliminary trial . Following the decision, Harrisburg attorney Ben Andreozzi read a statement from his client, who is known as Victim Four which said: 'This is the most difficult time of my life. I can't put into words how unbearable this has been on my life, both physically and mentally. 'I can't believe they put us through this only to waive the hearing. Regardless of the decision to waive the hearing, nothing has changed. I still will stand my ground and testify the truth.' Andreozzi told Penn Live the word 'truth' was underlined three times by his client, who would have been the first testify this morning but was only told of the decision at 8.30am. The hearing was expected to last a . day or more. Sandusky has denied the allegations, which led to the . departures of longtime Penn State football coach Joe Paterno and the . university president. 'This development we believe provides . maximum protection to most importantly the victims in this case,' said . Senior Deputy Attorney General E. Marc Costanzo. 'It avoids their having . to testify for a second time. They will of course testify at a trial in . the case.' Judgement day: Wearing a dark suit and with his wife Dottie by his side, he arrived at the courthouse where a judge will decide if the case will go to trial . Attorney: Joe Amendola, right, talks to reporters after a preliminary hearing to determine if there was enough evidence to hold Sandusky for trial on charges of sexually abusing boys . Statement: Jerry Sandusky himself told reporters afterwards: 'We fully intend to put together the best possible defense that we can do, to stay the course, to fight for four quarters...We want the opportunity to present our side' Costanzo said the amount of publicity . generated by Sandusky's attorney made the decision unexpected, but said . the decision to waive was not unusual given the strength of the state's . case. There have been no discussions about a . plea bargain, Costanzo said. Sandusky's next court appearance, an . arraignment, is scheduled for January 11. He remains under house arrest. Michael Boni, a lawyer for one of the . accusers, said he was encouraged by the development. The accusers 'do . not have to relive the horrors they experience up on the witness stand' by having to testify at the hearing and at trial. He . also said it may pave the way for a plea deal somewhere down the road . but the prosecution said that was not even discussed today. Sandusky, in a dark suit, entered the county courthouse through the back door this morning with his wife, Dottie, at his side. He looked straight ahead, ignoring questions from reporters. Defense attorney Joseph Amendola followed him into the courthouse. About 50 members of the media and 10 local residents, a few of them waiting with cameras to take pictures, awaited his arrival. Witnesses have contended before the . grand jury that Sandusky committed a range of sexual offenses against . boys as young as 10, assaulting them in hotel swimming pools, the . basement of his home in State College and in the locker room showers at . Penn State, where the 67-year-old former assistant football coach once . built a national reputation as a defensive mastermind. Pictured: Sandusky's mugshot after he was arrested for a second time on December 7, left, and arriving at court today with his wife Dottie by his side, right . Repeat: Sandusky was arrested and jailed on December 6 on new child sex abuse charges brought by two new accusers, including one who claims Sandusky molested him numerous times in a basement bedroom . The scandal has provoked strong . criticism that Penn State officials didn't do enough to stop Sandusky, . and prompted the departures of Hall of Fame football coach Joe Paterno . and the school's longtime president, Graham Spanier. Sandusky, . 67, has said repeatedly that he is innocent and has vowed to fight the . case. In interviews with NBC and The New York Times, he said he showered . and 'horsed around' with boys but never sexually abused them. Sandusky is free on $250,000 bail, but is subject to electronic monitoring and the equivalent of house arrest. He also can have no contact with victims or witnesses and have no unsupervised contact with minors. Last month Mr Sandusky told NBC's Bob Costas and The New York Times that his relationship to the boys who said he abused them was like that of an extended family. Mr Sandusky characterized his experiences with the children as 'precious times' and said the physical aspect of the relationships 'just happened that way' and didn't involve abuse. If the accusers stay true to what was in the grand jury report, the court will hear today that Sandusky often showered with them, put his hand on their legs during car rides, and showered them with presents, attention and trips to football games. His advances allegedly ranged from soapy bear hugs in the shower to rape in his basement during sleepovers. He admits showering with them but denies sexual contact.

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 4:28 PM on 16th December 2011 . Radioactive material was found in the luggage of a passenger bound for Iran - at Moscow's Sheremetyevo international airport. Russia's Federal Customs Service 'recently' found 18 pieces of radioactive metal packed in individual steel casing recently after the material triggered an alarm in the airport's radiation control system. It comes as tension rises between Western powers and Iran after a UN nuclear watchdog report last month said it appeared to have worked on designing a nuclear weapon. Discovery: Radioactive material found in the luggage of a passenger bound for Tehran was seized at Moscow's Sheremetyevo international airport . Tests showed the material found in the bag was a radioactive isotope which could be obtained only 'as a result of a nuclear reactor's operations'. Radiation levels in the area were 20 times above normal. An airport customs spokesman said the material had been identified as sodium-22, which can be used in medical equipment, but gave no other details. Sergei Novikov, spokesman for Rosatom nuclear agency, said the pieces were highly unlikely to have come from them. And he said, contrary to the customs' service claim, the isotope was produced by particle accelerators, not by nuclear reactors. Universities, research institutes and big medical centres can have the technology to produce it in Russia, he said. And he also claimed Rosatom had never sold sodium-22 to Iran, but it had supplied it with other types of medical isotopes. Claims: Iran, whose president is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, denies Western allegations it is seeking to build nuclear weapons . Research director Lars-Erik De Geer, of the Swedish Defence Research Institute, added: 'There is no weapons aspect to this (material).' The objects were sent to a Moscow prosecutor's office that deals with air and water transport, the service said in a statement. Authorities have opened a criminal investigation, but the Iranian was not detained. Spokeswoman Kseniya Grebenkina said the luggage had been seized some time ago, but could not specify when. The announcement of the discovery came two days after the U.S. House of Representatives endorsed harsher sanctions against Iran aimed at derailing its suspected pursuit of nuclear weapons. Iran denies Western allegations that it is seeking to build nuclear weapons. Earlier this year, Atomstroiexport, a Rosatom subsidiary, launched Iran's first nuclear reactor in Bushehr. Russian officials have insisted the deal with Iran is in line with international agreements and will oblige Tehran to ship all the spent fuel from the plant back to Russia for reprocessing to avoid a possibility of it being used in a covert weapons program.","Criminal investigation launched after discovery .

"Two weeks of intense public appearances coming up . By . Associated Press . Last updated at 4:56 AM on 18th December 2011 . There are mounting concerns for the health of the ailing Pope who has appeared increasingly frail and weak in recent weeks. Aides say Pope Benedict XVI seems worn out and unable to concentrate at times. He no longer meets individually with visiting bishops and few weeks ago started using a moving platform to spare him the long walk down St. Peter's Basilica. Ailing: Pope Benedict XVI, pictured in Rome last week, is helped to his feet . Benedict turns 85 in the new year, so a slowdown is only natural and expected, the Associated Press reports. And given his age and continued rigorous work schedule, it's remarkable he does as much as he does and is in such good health overall: Just this past week he confirmed he would travel to Mexico and Cuba next spring. But a decline has been noted as Benedict prepares for next weekend's grueling Christmas celebrations, which kick off two weeks of intense public appearances. And that raises questions about the future of the papacy given that Benedict himself has said popes should resign if they can't do the job. Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi has said no medical condition prompted the decision to use the moving platform in St. Peter's, and that it's merely designed to spare the pontiff the fatigue of the 100-yard walk to and from the main altar. And Benedict rallied during his three-day trip to Benin in west Africa last month, braving temperatures of 32 Celsius (90F) and high humidity to deliver a strong message about the future of the Catholic Church in Africa. Wiping sweat from his brow, he kissed babies who were handed up to him, delivered a tough speech on the need for Africa's political leaders to clean up their act, and visited one of the continent's most important seminaries. Back at home, however, it seems the daily grind of being pope - the audiences with visiting heads of state, the weekly public catechism lessons, the sessions with visiting bishops - has taken its toll. A spark is gone. He doesn't elaborate off-the-cuff much anymore, and some days he just seems wiped out. Take for example his recent visit to Assisi, where he traveled by train with dozens of religious leaders from around the world for a daylong peace pilgrimage. For anyone participating it was a tough, long day; for the aging pope it was even more so. Exhausted: Aides say they have found the Pontiff weaker than they'd ever seen him in the last few weeks . 'Indeed I was struck by what appeared to me as the decline in Benedict's strength and health over the last half year,' said Rabbi David Rosen, who had a place of honor next to the pope at the Assisi event as head of interfaith relations at the American Jewish Committee. 'He looks thinner and weaker ... which made the effort he put into the Assisi shindig with the extraordinary degree of personal attention to the attendees (especially the next day in Rome) all the more remarkable,' Rosen said in an email. That Benedict is tired would be a perfectly normal diagnosis for an 84-year-old, even someone with no known health ailments and a still-agile mind. He has acknowledged having suffered a hemorrhagic stroke in 1991 that temporarily affected his vision. And his older brother, who has a pacemaker for an irregular heartbeat, has expressed concern about Benedict's own heart. But Benedict is not a normal 84-year-old, both in what he is called to do and the implications if he were to stop. Popes are allowed to resign; church law specifies only that the resignation be 'freely made and properly manifested.' Only a handful have done so, however. The last one was Pope Gregory XII, who stepped down in 1415 in a deal to end the Great Western Schism among competing papal claimants. Before the decline: Pope Benedict XVI in September before fears were raised about his health . There's good reason why others haven't followed suit: Might the existence of two popes - even when one has stepped down - lead to divisions and instability in the church? Might a new resignation precedent lead to pressures on future popes to quit at the slightest hint of infirmity? Yet Benedict himself raised the possibility of resigning if he were simply too old or sick to continue on, when he was interviewed for the book 'Light of the World,' which was released in November 2010. 'If a pope clearly realizes that he is no longer physically, psychologically and spiritually capable of handling the duties of his office, then he has a right, and under some circumstances, also an obligation to resign,' Benedict said. The former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger had an intimate view as Pope John Paul II, with whom he had worked closely for nearly a quarter-century, suffered through the debilitating end of his papacy. After John Paul's death at age 84, it was revealed that he had written a letter of resignation to be invoked if he became terminally ill or incapable of continuing on. And it should be recalled that at the . time Benedict was elected pope at age 78 - already the oldest pope . elected in nearly 300 years - he had been planning to retire as the . Vatican's chief orthodoxy watchdog to spend his final years writing in . the 'peace and quiet' of his native Bavaria. Picture of health: Pope Benedict XVI in April 2005, when he held his first general audience of his new pontificate . And it should be recalled that at the time Benedict was elected pope at age 78 - already the oldest pope elected in nearly 300 years - he had been planning to retire as the Vatican's chief orthodoxy watchdog to spend his final years writing in the 'peace and quiet' of his native Bavaria. It is there that his elder brother, Monsignor Georg Ratzinger, still lives. Ratzinger, who turns 88 next month, is nearly blind. Benedict has said his brother has helped him accept old age with courage. Benedict said in 'Light of the World' that he knew his own strength was diminishing - steps are difficult for him and his aides regularly hold his elbows as he climbs up or down. But at the same time Benedict insisted that he had no intention of resigning to avoid dealing with the problems of the church, such as the sex abuse scandal. 'One can resign at a peaceful moment or when one simply cannot go on. But one must not run away from danger and say that someone else should do it,' he said. As a result, a papal resignation anytime soon seems unlikely. And Benedict is maintaining a hectic agenda. His planned trip to Cuba and Mexico next spring will fall shortly before he turns 85 on April 16. He has also said he'd like to make it to Rio de Janeiro in 2013 for the next World Youth Day. Sometime in the New Year he will presumably preside over a new consistory to name the new cardinals who will elect his successor. And he has lots of unfinished business close to his heart: Bringing back breakaway traditionalists under Rome's wing, the fate of the sex abuse-scarred Irish church, tensions with China. And he still cuts a robust figure in public given his age, walking briskly, speaking clearly and emphasizing key points. But his public engagements have been trimmed back; he had far fewer speeches in Benin than during his September visit to his native Germany or the United Kingdom last fall. And behind closed doors, during audiences without the glare of TV cameras or throngs of the faithful encouraging him on, he has begun to show his age, acquaintances say. The Rev. Joseph Fessio, Benedict's U.S. publisher and onetime student, sees the pope every so often, including during the summer when Benedict gathers his former theology students for an informal academic seminar at the papal summer retreat in Castel Gandolfo. Fessio recalled a day in the 2010 edition that remains with him: 'In the Saturday morning session, the pope looked older and weaker than I had ever seen him before. In fact I remarked to someone that it's the first time I've seen him look like the old man that he is. He was speaking in softer tones than even his normally soft speaking voice. His head was bowed. He was pale. He just looked frail.' But then, after lunch and an apparent rest, Benedict returned for the afternoon session. ""It was a complete transformation. He was lively, vigorous, attentive, and with his usual good humor,"" Fessio said. Clearly, at his age Benedict has good days and bad, even good half-days and bad. Yet he's never called in sick. In fact as pope, he has only had one significant known medical incident: He broke his right wrist when he tripped on the leg of his bed and fell while on vacation in the Alps in 2009. Lombardi says the pope realizes the limitations of his strength, and that's why the recent trip to Benin was a one-stop-only affair. 'I think it's an example of the great willingness and wisdom of the Holy Father to continue doing these trips, even those that are difficult or far away,' Lombardi said. He said the pope 'measures well what his strengths are, and the possibility of doing the trips well.' 'When I'm 84 I think I'll have been buried for many years,' he added. But he refused to give any kind of medical updates on the pope.'I'm not a doctor. I don't give medical bulletins,' Lombardi said. He paused, then added quietly: ""In this phase. At this moment.""","Two weeks of intense public appearances coming up .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:21 PM on 18th December 2011 . Over 300 people are reported missing, feared dead, after a boat carrying illegal immigrants heading for Australia sank off the coast of east Java in Indonesia. Only 76 people of 380 people on board had been rescued, said Sahrul Arifin, the head of emergency and logistics at the East Java Disaster Mitigation Center. He said strong waves wrecked the wooden boat about 56 miles out to sea late Saturday night. Rescued: A young survivor is carried by an Indonesian police officer after the heavily overloaded boat packed with mostly Afghan and Iranian asylum-seekers sank off Indonesia . 'Our search and rescue team have begun sweeping the water around where the accident took place but we are now sending body bags to that area,' Arifin said. He said the passengers were mainly believed to be illegal migrants from countries including Iran and Afghanistan. Many boat people from the Middle East and Asia use Indonesia as a transit point en route to Australia. Local TV showed images of more than a dozen shocked-looking survivors huddled in a clinic in Trenggalek, a town on Java island's southern coast. Shell shocked: An asylum seeker receives medical treatment at a clinic . in Trenggalek, East Java. Boat people from the Middle East and Asia use . Indonesia as a transit point en route to Australia . Exhausted survivors rest at a temporary shelter. Rescuers battled high waves as they searched for over 300 asylum seekers still missing . Many economic migrants from the Middle East attempt to cross the Indian Ocean in boats in search of a better life in Australia. Australia-based refugee advocate Jack Smit told Reuters first reports indicated the boat was overloaded. He suggested it might involve a new and inexperienced people-smuggling operator trying to make money quickly, as the boat reportedly left from the same port in Java as another that sank recently. 'It all points to new operators, and also the population of the boats is changing,"" Smit, of Project SafeCom Inc, told Reuters. 'It seems to me it's a new operator that took a risk that was too big.' (File picture): Australian defence personnel occupy the deck of a boat carrying about 200 asylum seekers from Indonesia in 2001 . Smit said there appeared to be an increasing number of Iranians taking to the boats and fewer Afghans than previously. He estimated that 2 to 5 percent of thousands of asylum-seekers taking to boats in this way each year died en route, with many deaths not reported. Asylum-seekers often pay thousands of dollars to board the boats, whose journeys are organized by people-smuggling networks based in Indonesia using ramshackle vessels often poorly equipped for the perilous journey to Australian waters. This sinking is the latest of several such disasters in recent years.",Overloaded wooden vessel went down in heavy seas off the coast of Indonesia .
"By . Rachel Quigley and Thomas Durante . Last updated at 8:17 PM on 17th December 2011 . Police have confirmed that remains found on New York's Long Island this week are those of missing prostitute Shannan Gilbert, who vanished last December after fleeing a client's home in a panic. Searchers found the bones on Tuesday morning in a dense wetland, not far from the neighbourhood where the 24-year-old disappeared in May 2010. While the medical examiner has positively identified the remains, police have not yet determined the cause of her death. Scroll down for video . Remains: Shannan Gilbert's remains were found in thick brush earlier this week, about a quarter of a mile away from where her belongings were found . Crime Scene: Investigators used metal detectors and K-9s to search a marsh for the remains of Shannan Gilbert who was last seen in 2010 running hysterically from a client's home in Oak Beach . Map: The locations where eight of ten bodies were found near Gilgo Beach since December 2010. The remains of Shannan Gilbert make it 11 . The New Jersey woman went missing after . fleeing from a client's home in Oak Beach. She was last seen racing into . the night, toward the marsh where her remains were discovered Tuesday. Police began searching for her last . December when they came upon the first of what would become ten homicide . victims' remains. They were strewn along several miles of thicket along . a parkway leading to Jones Beach. Police have said that they believe Gilbert may have drowned . accidentally while fleeing a client's home for an unclear reason. Two weeks ago, a search turned up Gilbert's purse, containing her ID, cell phone and lip gloss, as well as her jeans and shoes. The body was found about a quarter of a mile from where her belongings were found in an area with thick, overgrown brush. The 24-year-old Gilbert was a prostitute who advertised her services on Craigslist . Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said: 'We went in with the idea we were going in one last time to see if we could find anything and we did. 'This is very tough brambled area, difficult to traverse, you can't walk through that area and this is why it has taken us so long to find.' He said the location of the skeleton suggests that Gilbert may have been trying to flee across the wetland to a causeway. He suggested that she had become hopelessly entangled in the brush, which he called a 'tough, desolate, tangled mess'. He said: 'The terrain would have made it impossible. Our people who were in there over the last few days had to cut through that brush and bramble area, before she was located.' Officers had to use heavy, earth-moving equipment to excavate the site. Gilbert's disappearance prompted the investigation which led to five bodies found in burlap sacks on Gilgo Beach last December. The bodies have been positively identified as prostitutes advertising on Craigslist. Since then, five more bodies have been found which have yet to be identified. Police said they think Gilbert's disappearance is unrelated to the other bodies but a single killer may be responsible for the ten dead. Relatives of Megan Waterman and Maureen Brainard-Barnes, whose bodies were among the ten found, visited the scene on the first anniversary of the grisly discovery. 'It's been a living hell,' Waterman's mother Loraine Ela told reporters on Monday. 'It really is. Not a day doesn't go back where I don't think of Megan.' Relatives of some of the murdered women are due to hold a vigil today from 2pm to 5pm to mark the anniversary of when their loves ones’ remains were found. Thick bramble: Clothing and other items belonging to Shannan Gilbert were found in the marsh in the community of Babylon . New search: Officers had to use heavy, earth-moving equipment to excavate the site . A police officer and his cadaver dog were following up on the disappearance of Gilbert when they came across the first set of human remains on December 11, 2010. Two days later, three more bodies were found. By April, the total had risen to 10 bodies, all strewn along several miles of Ocean Parkway, on a barrier island south of Long Island that leads to Jones Beach. Authorities at first believed several people could be involved, but Police Commissioner Richard Dormer has said recently that detectives now suspect one serial killer is likely responsible for all ten deaths because the victims all had some connection to the sex trade. The victims included eight women, an Asian man wearing a dress and a toddler. Police believe the women were prostitutes and suspect the man was involved in the sex trade because he was wearing women’s clothing. The toddler is believed to be the child of one of the prostitutes.

"By . Katie Nicholl  and Christopher Leake . Last updated at 8:49 AM on 19th December 2011 . Prince Harry has offered to become the most senior Royal ever to appear in court after one of his best friends was mugged on a London street. The Prince was on the phone to Thomas van Straubenzee at the exact moment a robber took his friend’s BlackBerry mobile phone, according to police records. Harry heard the scuffle taking place and immediately drove to the scene with his protection officer. Fearing 28-year-old Mr van Straubenzee had been hurt, the Prince circled the streets of Battersea, south-west London, looking for him. Scuffle: The Prince . was on the phone to Thomas van Straubenzee (left) at the exact moment a robber . took his friend’s BlackBerry mobile . When he could not find his friend, he drove to the nearest police station where he found Mr van Straubenzee reporting the crime. As he had overheard the mugging taking place, Prince Harry was required to give a police statement, which is now part of an ongoing investigation. Wandsworth Police said they had arrested a man in connection with the robbery and recovered the stolen mobile phone. The man was released on bail. It is believed to be the first time a senior Royal has walked into a police station to report a crime. A police source told the Mail On Sunday: . ‘Prince Harry came into the station to give a statement. It was a . separate statement from the one given by his friend who was mugged.’ Royal witness: The police station where Harry went to report the crime . A police spokesman said: ‘Police are . investigating an allegation of personal robbery which occurred at . approximately 8.30pm on Wednesday, November 30, in Albert Bridge Road, . SW11. ‘A mobile phone was . taken during the robbery. This allegation was taken seriously,  as are . all allegations of robbery. A man was arrested on Thursday, December 1 . on suspicion of robbery and bailed to return in January pending further . inquiries. Police from Wandsworth are investigating.’ An . aide told The Mail on Sunday how Harry, who is believed to have been at . Clarence House, his London residence, leapt into action after their . conversation came to an abrupt end. ‘Prince Harry was aware of what had . happened to his friend and drove to the area immediately to try to find . him,’ the aide said. ‘He . circled the streets for a while in his car before following intuition . and finding his friend at a local police station in Battersea Bridge . Road. The Prince wanted to be there to offer some comfort and friendly . support. ‘Prince Harry . made his way to the station and by the time he arrived the police had . already enacted a number of operational procedures, which involved very . swift action and the kind of scenes you see on The Bill. Both the Prince . and his friend were very grateful to the police for how they handled . it.’ The 27-year-old . Prince, who has recently returned to the UK from America where he has . been completing the final stages of his Apache helicopter training . course, took Mr van Straubenzee home, then returned to Clarence House . with his protection officer. The . Prince and Mr van Straubenzee are childhood friends and attended . Ludgrove school in Berkshire and Eton together. Mr van Straubenzee is . also a close friend of Prince William and was one of his ushers at his . wedding. Nicknamed ‘Van’ by his friends, the 28-year-old accompanied Prince William on his first . official tour  to New Zealand in 2005 and is a  regular guest at William . and Kate’s Anglesey home. Both . Princes are also close to Tom’s parents, Alex and Claire van . Straubenzee, who live at their family’s estate in Grantham, . Lincolnshire, and are patrons of a memorial fund dedicated to Tom’s . brother Henry, who was killed in a car crash in 2002. Old friends: Thomas jokes around with William, Harry and his then-girlfriend Chelsy Davy at the concert for Diana at Wembley Stadium in 2007 . The fund raises money to help schoolchildren in Uganda. The Dutch-descended Van Straubenzees have a long history with the Royal Family and have served the British Crown for at least 150 years. Alex van Straubenzee is a former officer in the Royal Green Jackets, a regiment since merged into  The Rifles. William and Harry socialise frequently with Tom and his younger brother Charlie. Just weeks ago, Prince Harry attended a party for the Van Straubenzee memorial fund, and the friends regularly shoot together. Clarence House has confirmed the mugging but said they could not comment on whether Prince Harry was speaking to Mr van Straubenzee at the time of the incident because the police investigation is ongoing. A spokesman for Prince Harry said: ‘Prince Harry joined a friend  at a police station in South London after his friend had reported a  robbery. By the time Prince Harry arrived to be with his friend, the police investigation into the incident had already begun. ‘The investigation is ongoing, so we cannot comment further.’ Wealthy Battersea has become a crime hotspot for muggings, murders and drug-dealing. Rich . residents have become targets of robberies, often committed by street . gangs in the area – a stone’s throw across the Thames from exclusive . Chelsea. Last month Richard Ward, 37, died from massive head injuries after being set upon in an unprovoked gang attack. Danger spot: The road where Thomas van Straubenzee was attacked . In . February, Niall Hall, a former aide to the Queen Mother, was carjacked . and kidnapped by a gang who stripped him naked and ran knives along his . body.

Stores enjoyed their busiest weekend of the year as millions of shoppers finally came out to snap up  cut-price deals after months of disappointing sales. Queues formed outside some shopping centres before opening yesterday and an estimated £1billion was spent on Saturday alone. But experts warned retailers still faced an ‘austerity Christmas’ with profits down on last year and a likely ‘High Street bloodbath’ in January, with up to 3,000 stores facing closure. Many last minute customers were tempted in over the weekend by a raft of bargains . Christmas shoppers in Liverpool on Saturday, which was the busiest shopping day of the year so far . They suggested that because so many cut-price deals had been needed to lure customers, the heavy footfall would not necessarily translate into large profits. Around 11million shoppers spent up to £1.5million a minute after much of the country left buying presents to the final full weekend before Christmas. Capital Shopping Centres, which owns Glasgow’s Braehead, Gateshead’s Metrocentre, Cardiff’s St David’s, Manchester’s Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Thurrock, said its 14 sites had been ‘packed’ throughout Saturday and Sunday. Christmas shoppers at Derby city centre . John Lewis also reported record sales of £133.1million in the week to Saturday, which was 10.6 per cent higher than a year ago and the highest weekly figure ever achieved. Most consumers were attracted by a raft of bargains, with clothes store Jigsaw offering 30 per cent off party wear and half-price Scalextric sets available at ModelZone. Others defied the economic downturn to splash out on expensive items, with Selfridges reporting a surge in sales in Van Cleef and Cartier diamond necklaces and luxury watches. But despite the rammed shopping centres and High Streets, the Centre for Economics and Business Research predicted overall sales in December would be down 1.7 per cent compared with November, and 0.3 per cent lower than a year ago. Chief executive Douglas McWilliams insisted consumer confidence was ‘shot to pieces’ amid the economic gloom. He said: ‘Retailers are in for an austerity Christmas. Those who have left their shopping late can expect bargains aplenty because retailers are working hard to shift excess stock.’ Shops have been forced to introduce big reductions on products to get customers through the door . A spokesman for the British Retail . Consortium said: ‘This was a make-or-break weekend for many retailers . who were hoping for a big turnout after a disappointing few  months. ‘It does appear that large numbers went to the shops and that this was . probably the busiest shopping weekend of the year, but it is too early . to say whether this has translated into significant profits. ‘Stores put on so many cut-price deals to attract consumers that profit margins will inevitably have been squeezed.’ Retail analyst Jonathan De Mello, from the CB Richard Ellis consultancy, . warned up to 30,000 shop workers could lose their jobs as a swathe of . small independent retailers and some major High Street names are forced . to close as banks call in heavy debts. It is the most gloomy prediction since Christmas 2008, when the UK . economy was at its worst point since the start of the downturn. Currently 15 per cent of shops in Britain are vacant. This is expected . to rise by 1 per cent by the end of festive period, Mr De Mello said. He said: ‘The country is facing a High Street bloodbath immediately . after Christmas which will have a devastating impact on shopworkers and . other businesses that supply shops. It is unlikely that retailers will . survive the next rental quarter unscathed.’ An estimated £1 billion was spent by shoppers in the UK on Saturday alone .","£1 billion was spent on Saturday alone .

Washi, with winds gusting up to 56mph, hit the island of Mindanao late . on Friday, bringing heavy rain that also grounded some domestic flights . and left wide areas without power. The . hardest-hit areas were the cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro. Houses . were swept into the sea while people were sleeping inside. Scroll down for video... Devastated: A girl carries debris through a street in Cagayan de Oro, which was hit by Typhoon Washi . Destitute: Filipino families have been seeking shelter inside a basketball court turned into an evacuation centre in Cagayan De Oro . Homeless: Hundreds of Filipinos have been left destitute following the typhoon . The Philippine National Red Cross (PNRC) estimated 652 people were killed in eight provinces in the southern Mindanao region. 'Our office was swamped with hundreds of requests to help find their missing parents, children and relatives,' said Gwendolyn Pang, secretary-general of the PNRC. She added that the death toll was expected to rise as relief teams reached isolated areas. She said: 'It is very serious because the floods affected areas which have not experienced anything like this before. 'We have launched an appeal for support and we have received some already from our partners, including the Chinese Embassy and some corporations. 'There is a pressing need on how to handle the bodies. Water and food are also urgently required, as are hygiene kits, shelter and kitchen utensils.' 'This is the first time this has happened in our city,' Vicente Emano, mayor of Cagayan de Oro, said in a radio interview.  He said officials in the area did not receive adequate warning before the typhoon struck.

Chaos: Soldier search for survivors in Iligan (left) as the flood water start to recede (right) Cleaning up: Residents of Iligan start the long process of clearing up the area following the typhoon . The British Government has offered . its 'sincere condolences' to the families and friends of the victims, . many of whom are understood to be children. Filipino communities in London have . sent messages of support and offered to take part in fund-raising . activities to boost the relief effort, the Philippine Red Cross said. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokesman said they were not aware at this time of any British deaths or casualties. Foreign Office Minister Jeremy Browne said last night: 'The loss of life by flooding in the Philippines is tragic. I visited the Philippines earlier this month and know how keenly this loss will be felt by all its people. 'I would like to express my sincere . condolences to the families and friends of those affected. My thoughts . are with them and the government of the Philippines as they lead the . recovery work.' Carmelita Pulosan, 42, said she and . eight family members and neighbours survived by sitting on top of the . tin roof of their Cagayan de Oro house as it drifted miles into the open . sea after floodwaters swept through their village. They were rescued by . a passing cargo ship. She said: 'There was a deafening sound followed by a rush of water. We found ourselves in the river and the current took us out to the sea. 'The current was very strong. God is really good to us. He saved my family.' Only one 3-storey building was left standing in their village. Amor Limbago, 21, of Cagayan de Oro, was at work when the storm struck. She tried calling home to check on her parents but they did not reply. She rushed home as soon as the flash floods receded and found her parents and seven other relatives were gone, swept away from their hut by the river. She said: 'I returned and saw that our house was completely gone. There was nothing but mud all over and knee-deep floodwaters.' Mangled: Residents walk past vehicles which were dumped into a Cagayan de Oro canal during the typhoon . Struggle: The flood water has left the area around Iligan completely devastated . Inspection: Forlorn residents look at their ruined shanties after the flash floods . Edmund Rubio, a 44-year-old engineer, said he, his wife and two children scrambled to the second floor of their house in Iligan city as floodwaters engulfed the first floor, destroying his TV set and other appliances and washing away his car and motorcycle. Amid the panic, he heard a loud pounding on his door as neighbours living in nearby one-story houses pleaded with him to allow them up in his second floor. He said he brought 30 neighbours into the safety of the second floor of his house, which later shook when a huge floating log slammed into it. Brigadier General Roland Amarille, head of an army task force in Iligan, said soldiers had been mobilised to recover bodies and build coffins. Under-staffed mortuaries were unable to cope with the flood of bodies. Disaster: Filipinos look for missing relatives amongst houses swept away by rampaging flood waters . Escape: Volunteers use a rubber boat to ferry residents to safer ground . 'We need body bags and lime to deal with too many cadavers,' Amarille said, fearing an outbreak of disease. He said: 'Local mortuaries are no longer accepting cadavers and they are even asking people to bury the dead at once because there are too many bodies even in hallways.' The PNRC's Pang said many officials and residents did not expect such a huge volume of water cascading down mountains into river systems because the area is not in the usual typhoon belt. She said Cagayan de Oro last experienced floods in 2009 but there was only minimal damage and no deaths. Many found their homes destroyed after returning to shattered villages, Pang said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States, a major ally of the Philippines, was ready to assist Philippine authorities.

It could be on the market late next year, according to router manufacturer Broadcom . A new version of wi-fi designed for homes where several devices are connecting to the network at once, all demanding data, could be on the shelves by the end of next year. The new version should mean that streaming video and online gaming become much more practical in ordinary households - where current wi-fi standards often fail to deliver reliable service in a 'real world' situation. Up to 22 per cent of households now have more than six wi-fi devices using their networks at once, according to networking specialists Broadcom. Broadcom has confirmed that it will show off the new version of wi-fi at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas early next year - and ship products in 2012. The new version of wi-fi  - known as 802.11ac - is designed to deal with households where lots of devices are connecting to the same wi-fi network. It'll offer roughly double the range, should be more reliable at 'hanging on' to a connection, and will also work with previous devices. The new version of wi-fi can deliver speeds of up to 1.3Gbps per second - in theory, delivering entire DVDs' worth of data in seconds. 'There’s a much wider . highway for the traffic - and up to 20 channels to use,' says Rahul Patel of Broadcom . Downloading music should be near-instant, and streaming video through the home should offer no problems. Even with the fastest version of wi-fi currently on offer - 802.11n - streaming video can cause problems. Those problems become even more pronounced when several users connect at once. Broadcom's VP of its wireless division, Rahul Patel, said, 'At 5Ghz you have 20 odd . channels to use so you have more power and reach, there’s a much wider . highway for the traffic.' The new version of wi-fi will have roughly double the range - and up to 20 channels to cut interference and improve reliability . So far, the standard has not been ratified by the Wi-Fi Alliance - but Broadcom were hopeful that the standard would be ratified next year, and the company could deliver devices for year end. 'Consumers are demanding seamless, pervasive connectivity — something that will be possible with new technologies such as 802.11ac,' said Broadcom via a release. Broadcom's research shows that 22 per cent of households now own six or more wi-fi compatible devices - a statistic that has quadrupled in the last three years.","22 per cent of households have 6 or more wi-fi devices .

A team of scientists from Oregon have collected microbes from an icy 'lava tube' in mountains in Orgeon - similarly hostile to the Red Planet's surface - and found common microbes thriving. The microbes 'lived' on iron from a mineral found in rocks - a mineral, olivine, also found in volcanic rocks on Mars, and could survive low oxygen conditions and the total absence of organic food. Olympus Mons on Mars, the largest volcano in the solar system: Volcanic rock - olivine - which is found on Mars formed the 'food' for the bacteria living in mountains in Oregon . ‘This microbe is from one of the most common families of bacteria found on Earth,’ said Amy Smith, a doctoral student at Oregon State University and one of the authors of the study. ‘You can find its cousins in caves, on your skin, at the bottom of the ocean and just about anywhere. What is different, in this case, is its unique qualities that allow it to grow in Mars-like conditions.’ The scientists proved that that microbes have adapted to deal with their harsh living conditions. In a normal, room-temperature settings, with normal oxygen levels, the bacteria eat organic materials such as sugar. But the scientists removed the food, turned down the temperature to near-freezing and lowered the oxygen, they turned to the food they survive on in the lava tubes - olivine, a common mineral found in volcanic rocks on Earth and on Mars – as its energy source. ‘This reaction - where microbes 'feed' on a common mineral from volcanic rocks - just hasn’t been documented before,’ said Martin Fisk, a professor in OSU’s College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences and an author on the study. Lava tubes in Oregon: Scientists found that icy lava tubes in the high mountains played host to bacteria that thrived in icy, oxygen-poor environments and lived on iron rather than normal 'food' ‘In volcanic rocks directly exposed to air and at warmer temperatures, the oxygen in the atmosphere oxidizes the iron before the microbes can use it. But in the lava tube, where the bacteria are covered in ice and thus sheltered from the atmosphere, they out-compete the oxygen for the iron. The microbes were collected from a lava tube near Newberry Crater in Oregon’s Cascades Mountains, at an elevation of about 5,000 feet. They were within the ice on rocks some 100 feet inside the lava tube, in a low-oxygen, near-freezing environment. Scientists, including Fisk, have said that the subsurface of Mars could have similar conditions and harbor bacteria. In fact, Fisk has examined a meteorite originating from Mars that contained tracks – which could indicate consumption by microbes – though no living material was discovered. Similar tracks were found on the rocks from the Newberry Crater lava tube, he said. 'Conditions in the lava tube are not as harsh as on Mars,’ Fisk said. ‘On Mars, temperatures rarely get to the freezing point, oxygen levels are lower and at the surface, liquid water is not present. But water is hypothesized to be present in the warmer subsurface of Mars. Although this study does not exactly duplicate what you would find on Mars, it does show that bacteria can live in similar conditions. ‘We know from direct examination, as well as satellite imagery, that olivine is in Martian rocks,’ Fisk added. ‘And now we know that olivine can sustain microbial life.’","Bacteria survive 5,000 feet up and 100ft below ground .

The drugs don't work: Many people expect a course of antibiotics to clear up bouts of cystitis - but new strains are becoming more resistant to medication . Marie Corman was far from worried when she experienced the first symptoms of cystitis. ‘I’d had it once before a few years ago, and knew a quick course of antibiotics would clear it up,’ says the 36-year-old account manager from London. So Marie, whose real name has been changed, took the week-long course of antibiotics prescribed by her GP, and her symptoms disappeared. Cystitis is a urinary tract infection, most often caused by bacteria. Around half of all women suffer from it at some time — in fact, cystitis is one of the main reasons for GP antibiotic prescriptions. But, in Marie’s case, the treatment didn’t seem to have worked, because just a few weeks later her symptoms returned. She was given another course of antibiotics, only for the infection to flare up a month later. ‘I was getting worried by then,’ she says. ‘The doctor kept handing out antibiotics, but they didn’t seem to be working.’ She went privately to see a specialist, who identified the culprit — a type of E.coli resistant to a range of common antibiotics. Most people associate antibiotic resistance with deadly hospital superbugs such as MRSA. Last month, Professor Laura Piddock of the Anti-Microbial Agents Research Group at the University of Birmingham warned that without new weapons against these dangerous pathogens, we face the threat of untreatable infections. But what many people don’t realise is that resistant strains exist outside hospital, and they can make otherwise innocuous ailments very difficult to treat.We’ve become used to the idea that bacterial infections, such  as ear or lung infections, can be stopped in their tracks by antibiotics. But as Marie’s case shows, that isn’t always true. Her antibiotics had some effect on the bug causing the infection, but enough resistant ones were left for it to flare up again. 'I spent 10 days in hospital getting an infusion three times a day' Once Marie’s drug-resistant bug had been . identified, ‘things started to get frightening’. She had to go into . hospital for tests to check if the infection had reached her bladder — . and the surgeon accidentally cut her bladder wall, so it had to be . stitched and she needed a catheter while it healed. Then, the only treatment that could tackle her resistant bug was a powerful penicillin that had to be delivered directly into a vein. ‘I spent ten days in hospital getting an infusion three times a day,’ recalls Marie. ‘I had tubes coming out of me and was terrified I would catch something else resistant. ‘It’s frightening how fast a resistant bug can take you from healthy to very sick.’ Around 20 per cent of urinary tract infections cases seen by GP Dr Alastair Hay, a specialist in primary health care at the University of Bristol, don’t respond to the first-line antibiotic, although they do then respond to other antibiotics. But urinary tract infections are not the only conditions triggered by drug-resistant bugs. Nearly 100 cases of resistant pneumonia have been reported in the UK so far. And recently there were reports that a strain of the bacteria that causes gonorrhoea had emerged in Japan that was resistant to all known antibiotics. Super bug: A strain of E.coli resistant to antibiotics has been found in some cases of cystitis . So why aren’t there any new drugs to target such bugs? Well, they don’t make enough profit, so drug companies have stopped researching them. There are just four new antibiotics in development worldwide, and none targets resistant bacteria (861 more profitable drugs and vaccines are being tested against cancer). The very things that patients like about antibiotics — they work quickly after being taken for only a short time — are what makes them unprofitable. Blockbuster drugs such as statins make billions because people have to take them for years. Professor Piddock’s solution is to subsidise drug companies to develop new antibiotics. She is also heading a campaign to raise awareness among GPs and patients, which could result in less antibiotic prescribing. GPs give out around 80 per cent of antibiotics — all too often for viral infections such as colds and flu, which the drugs can’t treat; they are also hardly effective against infections such as tonsillitis and sinusitis. When you treat an infection with an antibiotic, it kills off the  harmful, non-resistant bacteria, leaving the resistant ones room to expand. There may be other options, according to George Lewith, professor of Health Research at Southampton University. ‘Cutting back on antibiotics doesn’t mean leaving patients with nothing,’ he says. ‘We’ve found that aspirin-type anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroid can be very effective in treating symptoms such as fever, aches and pains.’ Another approach is better hygiene. Some years ago MRSA was infecting 2,000 people every three months in the UK, but the number has dropped below 100 a month thanks to better hygiene. ‘Improved hygiene can make a big difference,’ says Dr Yoon Loke of the University of East Anglia medical school, and an expert in harmful drug effects. ‘We also need better, quicker ways of identifying which bacterium a patient is infected with so they can be given an effective drug rather than a broad spectrum antibiotic. It is less glamorous than new wonder drugs but it could make a big difference.’ It could also save many like Marie a lot of misery.",Resistant strain of E.coli found in some cases of urinary tract infections .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:51 PM on 16th December 2011 . The Queen could be called in to decide who will be Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister - as the South Pacific nation descends into political chaos. The island, which will be visited by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of . Cornwall next year as part of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, is currently deadlocked. Two men are claiming to be in charge and their respective police chiefs are maintaining peace and refusing to get involved. It comes after Sir Michael Somare, 76, was ousted from office by Peter O'Neill in August during the five months he was in Singapore undergoing a series of heart operations. Tough decision: Queen Elizabeth II could be called upon to choose who should be Papua New Guinea's next Prime Minister . Power struggle: Peter O'Neill (left) took power when Sir Michael Somare (right) was out of the country . The Supreme Court and Governor-General Sir Michael Ogio has backed Somare. The Port Moresby court has ruled he was illegally removed from power. But lawmakers loyal to O'Neill have passed retroactive legislation recognising him as leader. Therefore it could technically fall to Queen Elizabeth II, whose representative in the country is the Governor-General, to choose the Commonwealth country's new leader. But that would only take place when an absolute majority of the Parliament votes to sack the Governor-General, after which Parliament must approach the Queen and ask her to dismiss him. At a news conference yesterday, O'Neill said he had ordered police to take control of government offices, including the prime minister's office, where Somare and his followers were working. But O'Neill said he had no authority to issue arrest warrants for Somare or Somare's ministers. Protest: Peter O'Neill's supporters have taken to the streets to show their political strength . Greeting: Peter O'Neill shakes the hands of his supporters after making a speech . As heavily armed police guarded state . institutions, the police commissioner appointed by O'Neill, Tom Kulunga, . said last night there were no plans to remove Somare or his ministers . from the buildings. Kulunga declared the police force . would remain neutral. He said: 'This is a political situation, this is . not a police situation.' Papua New Guinea is a Commonwealth country and the Governor-General is her representative. It is technically possible that the Queen could be called on to break the deadlock. But . that would only take place when an absolute majority of the Parliament . votes to sack the Governor-General, after which Parliament must approach . the Queen and ask her to dismiss him. Police Commissioner Fred Yakasa, who was . appointed by Somare soon after the Supreme Court restored him to power, . told The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper he agreed with Kulunga that . police should remain independent of the politicians. Somare's supporters had tried to flush . O'Neill's camp out of Parliament House, which they have occupied since . the Supreme Court decision on Monday, by ordering that electricity and . water to the building be cut. But PNG Power chief executive Lawrence Solomon had refused to carry out the directive, the newspaper said. Neither Solomon nor Somare was immediately available for comment on Friday. 'We . are sick and tired of the selfish behavior by our politicians,' said .

Royal guests: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Charles will be visiting Papua New Guinea next year as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations . The stand-off began on Monday, when the . Supreme Court ruled that O'Neill's election by parliament in August was . unconstitutional and said Somare should be reinstated as leader. Lawmakers backing O'Neill stormed the gates of Ogio's official residence on Tuesday, demanding he meet with O'Neill. Ogio, . who represents British Queen Elizabeth II - the country's head of state . - said he would decide by Wednesday who should be prime minister. On . Wednesday, Ogio swore in Somare's Cabinet. Somare insisted he did not . need to be sworn in, because the Supreme Court had already reinstated . him as prime minister. But a . majority of the country's 109 lawmakers voted later that day to suspend . Ogio and replace him temporarily with Speaker Jeffery Nape. Nape then . swore O'Neill in as prime minister. Somare . dismissed Ogio's suspension as corrupt. 'The only two people who can . make a difference are Sir Michael and Mr O'Neill,' said Malabang, head . of the trade union. 'They have to calm down and come together for the . sake of our people.' Somare spent five months in Singapore undergoing three heart operations before returning to parliament September 6.

City and federal agencies are looking into a freak power surge as the possible cause of a horrific elevator tragedy that left a Madison Avenue advertising executive crushed to death. Suzanne Hart, 41, of Brooklyn, New York, was killed on Wednesday in a freak accident when the elevator malfunctioned at the Manhattan offices of ad agency Young and Rubicam. Ms Hart was caught as the lift suddenly shot up, crushing her between floors of the Madison Avenue building. Tragic: Suzanne Hart, 41, of Brooklyn, New York, was killed on Wednesday when the lift malfunctioned at the Manhattan offices of ad agency Y&R . Now, regulators are looking into the possibility of a power surge that may have sent the elevator jerking out-of-control and rendering its safety devices useless. An elevator industry source told the New York Daily News that Miss Hart's death was a horrific freak accident. The source told the paper that the chance of an elevator jerking upward just as she was entering is a 'billion to one'. Meanwhile, the company responsible for maintenance at several other buildings where workers are reporting trouble with the transports has come under the microscope. The New York Post reported Saturday that Transel Elevator, Inc, is responsible for the upkeep of lifts at dozens of Manhattan buildings. One of them is 95 Park Avenue, where some workers said they ride at their own risk. Romeo Cortinas, who works on the building’s 15th floor, told the Post: 'It’s horrible. It jerks, skips floors, sinks, stops. It does what it wants when it wants.' Mr Cortinas added: 'Every time I ride it, it’s an adventure.' Victim: Ms Hart was crushed to death in the freak elevator incident at her office on Wednesday . Yesterday, investigators said they were looking at work done by Transel on the elevator shortly before the accident. Tony Sclafani, a spokesman for the city Department of Buildings, told the Post: 'This work has now become the focus of our investigation.' Meanwhile, friends and family members of Miss Hart are coping with their loss. Her boyfriend of more than five years, Chris Dickson, told the New York Times: ‘She’s a beautiful person, and I don’t have words for this. I loved her.’ ‘No father could have ever been more . proud of her,’ her father Alex Hart, who has flown north from his home . in Florida to New York, told the Times. ‘She was a fantastic young woman,’ he . told the New York Post. ‘I’m grateful for every day I had with her. I’m . just sorry it happened so soon - I miss her.’ Two other people who got on the lift before her looked on in horror as Ms Hart was killed, They were later rescued . and taken to a nearby hospital for trauma. The lift jammed between the first and . second floors but nobody was physically injured apart from Ms Hart, a . director of business development. Responding: Emergency personnel gather outside the building where the 41-year-old was killed on the scene, treating only others for trauma . Ms Hart was stepping onto the elevator when her foot became caught in the gap between the elevator car and the lobby floor. 'No father could have ever been more proud of her.' Alex Hart . Safety officials said the car then rose . abruptly with its doors still open, pulling her along, inside the . 26-storey office near Grand Central Terminal. The building has been the long-time . home of Ms Hart's company, the advertising agency Y&R, formerly . known as Young & Rubicam. Sentry: An officer keeps a grim vigil at the scene where Ms Hart was killed in Manhattan, New York . A buildings department spokesman said the elevator was inspected in June and no safety issues were found then. The last time the elevator received a violation for a safety hazard was in 2003, and the condition was corrected, he said. The elevator is one of 13 in the tower . and was taken out of use. Y&R announced just days ago that it plans to . vacate the building for a new base. Ms Hart, originally from California, . had worked at the agency - which represents Campbell's Soup, Land Rover . and Xerox - since June 2007.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:42 PM on 14th December 2011 . A woman on kidney dialysis has risked her life to give birth to a healthy baby girl. Doctors usually advise women not to try for a child if they are suffering from kidney failure as only a handful of British women on dialysis have ever successfully had a child. However Alison Kirk, 28, was determined to try even though she had already lost one baby at 24 weeks. Baby joy: Mike Scott with partner Alison Kirk who gave birth to Gracey May after being on kidney dialysis at Liverpool's Women's Hospital . She successfully gave birth to a premature Gracie Mae at Liverpool Women's Hospital three weeks ago. Ms Kirk from Wallasey, Merseyside, is on the organ transplant list after being diagnosed with a rare condition kidney disorder called cystinosis at the age of three. She went through six hours of dialysis for six days a week throughout her pregnancy, to give her baby the best possible chance of survival. Gracie Mae was delivered safely by Caesarean section after Ms Kirk had a massive bleed at 30 weeks and four days. The baby weighed 3lbs 10oz and is said to be doing well in the hospital's neonatal care unit. Cystinosis is a rare inherited condition in which  an amino acid called cystine accumulates in the body's cells. This can cause damage to . organs especially the kidneys and eyes. Ms Kirk has infantile cystinosis with symptoms appearing early in childhood. Symptoms include an excessive thirst, poor appetite and rickets. These symptoms are caused by damage to two parts of the kidneys' filtering units. Without urgent treatment, the kidneys eventually fail and the child needs dialysis or a transplant. The condition can also develop in the early teens and symptoms are often milder. There is around one case in every 200,000 live births in developed countries. It two parents carry the defective cystinosis gene their child has a one in four chance of developing the condition. Ms Kirk and her partner, Michael Scott, 25, said the birth would never have been possible but for the skill and dedication of teams at Liverpool Women's and the Renal Department of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals. 'They were all so amazing and so caring. Gracie Mae is only here because of them,' she said. 'I always thought I'd never be a mum. When I got pregnant and I told the doctors, I knew the risks that I could lose another child, but I wanted to go through with it because if I didn't then I'd never know.' A successful pregnancy in women treated with renal dialysis is rare. There had only been 90 pregnancies world-wide in 10 years with a success rate of between 50 and 75 per cent. Alison's obstetrician praised her determination in deciding to try for a child. Steve Walkinshaw, consultant in maternity and fetal medicine at Liverpool Women's Hospital: 'I have never come across one before during my experience. She is a very brave woman .' Liverpool Women's and the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen hospitals established a combined obstetric renal clinic some years ago to co-ordinate the care of these and other women with complex kidney problems. The pregnancy was Ms Kirk's second, after she became pregnant in 2004 but went into premature labour at 24 weeks. Her son, Jack, was born in February 2005 but only lived for 12 hours. Alison praised the staff at Liverpool Women's Hospital who delivered her premature baby safely . Mr Walkinshaw added: 'Alison represented a real challenge to the team with her need for very frequent dialysis and the presence of a condition called placenta praevia which carries a risk of massive bleeding during pregnancy. 'The combination of risks undoubtedly put Alison's life in danger and meant she had to spend a lot of the final weeks of her pregnancy in our hospital. 'The successful outcome here is a testament to the care provided by a number of doctors, nurses and midwives at both hospitals and shows what can be achieved in modern maternal medicine.'","Alison had already lost one baby at 24 weeks as a result of her kidney disorder .

"By . Daniel Martin . Last updated at 10:25 PM on 23rd November 2011 . Consumption of alcohol has soared in Britain over the last few decades while it has plummeted on the continent. Adults in the UK drink 9 per cent more than they did in 1980, making us the 11th booziest nation in Europe – although our intake has fallen slightly over the past few years. But over the same period, drinking in France fell by 37 per cent, Germany by 32 per cent, Spain by 46 per cent and Italy by 52 per cent. Wasted: A woman lies in the street after collapsing following a night out at a nearby club . Ireland, Finland and Sweden were the only other Western European nations to see drinking increase over the past 30 years, according to the report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The study also found Irish women had overtaken their British counterparts for the first time to be the most obese in Europe. However, Britain still has the fattest men, and our children are the third fattest – behind only Greece and Italy. The statistics will increase concerns over whether our lifestyle is making us one of the unhealthiest countries, leading to soaring rates of liver disease and diabetes. Last month, doctors from the Royal College of Physicians said drinkers should have three days off alcohol a week to help protect their livers. The OECD study found that in 2009, those . over the age of 15 in the UK drank an average of 10.2 litres of pure . alcohol – up 9 per cent on the figure in 1980. Developing nations such as India, China, Mexico and Brazil have seen huge increases over the period. But in Western Europe, only Finland (up 27 per cent), Ireland (up 18 per cent) and Sweden (up 10 per cent) saw larger rises. There were significant falls in the United States (down 15 per cent), Australia (down 22 per cent) and Canada (down 23 per cent). Across the 40-member bloc of the OECD, consumption declined by 9 per cent. The UK’s alcohol consumption in 2009 stood at 11th in the OECD. Top of the list was France, where annual consumption is 12.3 litres, followed closely by Portugal and Austria. Britain’s consumption was far ahead of Germany (9.7 litres), the United States (8.8 litres) and the OECD average (9.1 litres). However, the report found that the amount of alcohol being drunk has started to fall over the last few years, from a peak of more than 11 litres in 2004. Mark Pearson, head of the social policy unit at the OECD, said: ‘Alcohol is an undeniable health problem for the UK – in particular binge drinking. ‘Britain has a drinking culture far more than the continent, and other countries such as France have taken a tougher stance on taxation and so forth.’ Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said: ‘These figures demonstrate just how reckless Labour were to unleash 24-hour drinking on our communities, leading to spiralling levels of alcohol consumption.’ Figures also showed smoking rates in the UK are below the European average. Around 21.5 per cent of adults smoke, down a fifth over the past decade. Greece is top with 39.7 per cent of adults smoking, up 5.6 per cent since 1999.","Britain is 11th booziest nation in Europe .

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 7:31 AM on 16th December 2011 . Britons are fighting a losing battle against the bulge with more than a quarter of men and women classed as clinically obese for the first time. Today's report from the NHS Information Centre revealed that 26 per cent of men and women were obese in 2010. This has increased from 13 per cent of men and 16 per cent of women in 1993. The number of overweight and obese men and women and obese-only men and women has gradually increased since 1993 . Only one in three men are now a 'normal . weight' with 68 per cent of men and 58 per cent of women classed as . overweight or obese. This was calculated by combining each person's body mass index with their waist circumference. Overall, 16 per cent of men and 17 per cent of women have also been diagnosed with asthma. Obesity can cause a number of health problems including type 2 diabetes and heart disease . The bleak figures follow a report from the National Child Measurement Programme that found one one child in three is overweight when they leave primary school at the age of 11. Almost a fifth are classed as obese, meaning they are so fat they risk knocking years off their lives. And . the number of ten and 11-year-olds who fall into this category has . risen by nearly 10 per cent in just four years, according to NHS data. The only improvement was seen among . reception children, with the number of obese four and five years old . dropping from 9.8 per cent in 2009 to 9.4 per cent in 2010. Tam . Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, told Mail Online: 'Any encouragement . having read yesterday's toddler obesity improvement has gone out of the . window!

Iranian experts have carried out the necessary preparations at Fordow near the holy city of Qom. It paves the way for the Islamic state to begin higher-grade uranium enrichment at the site on a former military base. Mobbed: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gets a hero's welcome as he arrives in Yasouj, around 1,000 miles south of Tehran today . Playing the crowd: President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is cheered by supporters in a stadium in Yasui . V for victory: President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad enjoys the acclaim . The machines, equipment and nuclear material needed have been transferred and installed at Fordow, the sources added. They suggested the work itself - until now conducted above ground at another location - could start when Iran takes the decision. It coincides with a period of escalating tension between Western powers and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad after a U.N. nuclear watchdog report last month said Tehran appeared to have worked on designing a nuclear weapon, and that secret research may continue. The United States and its European allies have seized on the unprecedented document by the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency to ratchet up the sanctions pressure on Iran, one of the world's largest oil producers. This satellite image shows a facility under construction inside a mountain located about 20 miles north northeast of Qom, Iran . Enriched uranium can be used to fuel power plants, which is Iran's stated aim, or provide material for atomic bombs if processed much further, which the West suspects is the country's ultimate intention. A rare visit by Iran's intelligence chief to Saudi Arabia sought to refute U.S. claims that Tehran planned to kill the kingdom's ambassador to Washington, a senior Iranian official said today. Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said Iran also wanted to convince Saudi Arabia that the U.S. and Israel are seeking to sow seeds of discord between the two regional powers. Intelligence Minister Heidar Moslehi was reported to have met the Saudi Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdel-Aziz Al Saud during his visit yesterday. The prince is also the kingdom's interior minister. Initially, few reports emerged from the meeting. Saudi diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to reporters, said the two discussed regional issues, including developments in Syria and Bahrain. Iran has dismissed the U.S. accusations that Tehran was involved in a plot to assassinate Adel Al-Jubeir, calling the claims 'absurd.' Proliferation expert Shannon Kile noted . that Iran earlier this year announced it would shift its most sensitive . enrichment activity to Fordow but that the actual start would still be . significant. 'Obviously, for people who are concerned about Iran's ability to break out and to enrich to weapons-grade this is a pretty good step along that route,' said Kile, of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Iran's decision last year to raise the level of some enrichment from the 3.5 per cent purity needed for normal power plant fuel to 20 per cent worried Western states that saw this as bringing it significantly closer to the 90 per cent needed for a bomb. Iran says the material will help fuel a research reactor. Iran's main enrichment plant is located near the central town of Natanz. But the country said in June it would shift its higher-grade activity to Fordow, offering better protection from any military attack, and also sharply boost output capacity. 'If conditions require, we will move . (our) uranium enrichment facilities to safer locations,' said the . Revolutionary Guard's anti-sabotage chief Gholam Reza Jalali. Iran's main uranium enrichment site . in Natanz in central Iran is built partly underground while the . long-secret Fordo facility was built deep inside a mountain as a . precaution from aerial attacks. Jalili said the existing infrastructure . has already been 'a kind of deterrent' against attacks. 'Our vulnerability in the nuclear . field is minimal,' Jalali claimed. 'If Americans and Israelis were able . to attack and harm our nuclear facilities, they would have definitely . done so by now.' Jalali's unit was set up on an order from Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and is tasked with reducing the possibility and minimizing damage from potential military action against Iran. Natanz is of key concern since it is the country's main enrichment site and the location of the bulk of its centrifuges - machines that are used for enriching uranium in a technology that can produce either fuel for power plants or fissile material for a nuclear warhead. Suspect site: A general view of the Arak heavy-water project, 120 miles southwest of Tehran . A U.N. nuclear watchdog report last month said Tehran appeared to have worked on designing a nuclear weapon . Natanz computers have been the target of a cyber attack in 2009 and experts there have had to battle a powerful computer worm known as Stuxnet, which has the ability to send centrifuges spinning out of control. Iran acknowledged Stuxnet affected a limited number of centrifuges at Natanz but said its scientists discovered and neutralized the malware before it could cause serious damage. Jalali did not elaborate on possible sites for the relocation of nuclear facilities but such an effort would be hugely complicated and would require places able to store the technology safely. In August, Iran announced it was moving some of its centrifuges to Fordo, just north of the holy city of Qom, because that site offered better protection from possible airstrikes but did not later elaborate on the move or say whether the centrifuges came from Natanz. The United States and Israel, Iran's arch foes, have not ruled out military action if diplomacy fails to resolve the long-running nuclear dispute, which has the potential to spark a wider conflict in the Middle East.","Machines and uranium enrichment material moved to underground site .

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 4:54 PM on 14th December 2011 . An eight-year-old boy with an aggressive form of cancer has fallen victim to a 'postcode lottery,' after his health authority refused to fund his place on a trial that could save his life. Adam Bird has undergone two-and-a-half years of intensive treatment since he was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, which affects the nerve tissue. Doctors say immunotherapy - which is offered in Germany - could slow down the condition and even provide a potential cure. Battling on: Adam has continued to go to school in between treatments for his rare condition . His consultant at the Royal Marsden applied for funding in June but the request was turned down by Adam's local NHS trust. Yet his parents had met families from Dorset, Cornwall, Devon and Wales who all had children receiving NHS funding for the treatment. His father Nick said today: 'It is totally unacceptable for Adam to . be treated differently from children from other parts of the UK - he . should not be discriminated against simply because of where he lives. 'This isn’t a life prolonging treatment . for Adam. This is potentially a cure - the difference between him making . 90 or his ninth birthday.' Refusing to be beaten, his parents set up the charity Adam's Appeal, which has funded his ongoing treatment. He now spends two-and-a-had weeks in Germany . getting treatment and the same amount of time at home. Mr Bird, 40, and his wife Alison, 41, . from Epsom in Surrey have two other children who are 10 and 12 who stay with other family members when they take Adam abroad. The whole family are now going to Germany this week so they can be with Adam while he has treatment over Christmas. Good spirits: Adam undergoes an EEG to check on his seizure risk during treatment . However, they said there were many other children who would not be able to raise the £68,000 needed to pay for the whole trial. 'Life is simple hard hard enough as . it is when things out of your control make it harder still you just . resent it,' said Mr Bird. 'However, I am doing it for other . families who may be in the same situation as ourselves, who cannot raise . the money - it is simply not right.' He added that he still strongly disagreed by the decision made by the Surrey Primary Care Trust to refuse to pay for Adam's treatment. 'We do question the unfairness of . Adam being treated differently from other children throughout the . country - how can that possibly be justified?' he asked. Mr Bird father said the Department of Health had decreed during an appeal for another boy with neuroblastoma that funding would be made available for overseas trials of immunotherapy if children did not qualify in Britain. However, some PCTs were not honouring this. The charity, Neuroblastoma Alliance UK, has helped the family throughout Adam’s illness. Adam, pictured here in June, is heading over to Germany for more treatment over Christmas, after his parents raised the necessary funds . 'It seems very unfair that children do not receive the same treatment from the NHS across the UK,' said the charity’s chief executive, Alison Moy. 'There really is a postcode lottery in terms of receiving this potentially life-saving treatment, which is something that the Government urgently needs to address.' Linda Honey, head of pharmaceutical commissioning at NHS Surrey, acknowledged that requests for the specialist treatment would only be considered under an individual funding request policy and needed to demonstrate “exceptional” clinical circumstances to be put forward. She said the decisions made by other primary care trusts to fund the treatment were 'local decisions which take into account individual circumstances.' 'I understand that Adam is currently receiving monoclonal antibody treatment and we wish him well,' she said. 'Clearly, Adam’s family are disappointed with our decision to not fund his treatment abroad - our decision takes into account the clinical evidence available, individual circumstance and an assessment of the benefits to the patient. 'Monoclonal antibody treatment is only available in clinical trial in the UK - unfortunately, where patients fall outside the eligibility criteria for entry into this trial this has left the patients and their families in very difficult situations.'

Selling Smart cars - the tiny German 'microcars' popular in Europe has always been a tough job in the U.S. So Smart is set to unveil the first Smart pickup concept - titled the Smart For-U.S. It will celebrate what Smart calls 'its world premiere' at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, 14 - 22 January 2012. The new Smart car is a pickup truck aimed squarely at the U.S. market - armed with an electric-bike charging station on the back, and a smartphone instead of a rear-view mirror . Smart says the concept is so small it could actually be loaded into the loading area of a normal American pickup truck. It's just 12 feet long and 5ft high - and it wears its hi-tech heart on its sleeve. In place of a conventional rear-view mirror the smart for-us features . a smartphone accommodated in a holder on top of the instrument panel . support. The driver can see what is happening on the road behind with the help of an integrated video camera. Two e-bikes will sit in the back, and the loading area is all-electric too - though whether the vehicle's 12ft length will appeal to Americans remains to be seen . It's also unlikely to match the roar of the average pickup truck - it has a state-of-the-art electric drive with a55 kW magneto-electric motor the zero-emission smart for-us is agile and lively to drive. Smart CEO Dr. Annette Winkler says 'We at smart love pick-ups – if they are small on the outside, large on the inside, very safe and extremely comfortable. With the smart for-us a petrol station is no longer required!' Obviously, plenty of power sockets will be.Not only does the two-seater run entirely electrically, it also sports a docking station for two e-bikes, and you charge them up as it drives - so you can jump off for yet more environmentally friendly transport once you park up. Naturally, the cargo area is all-electric, too. 'When it opens first of all the cargo floor including tailboard retracts by one foot, then the tailgate slides down in a parallel position. The cargo on the 3ft cargo area is then extremely easy to access,' says Winkler.","German pickup truck will be all-electric and just 12ft long .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:01 AM on 19th December 2011 . Health and safety at Selfridges came under the spotlight after a grandmother who smashed her leg when she slipped on a plastic icicle in a Santa's Grotto won the right to up to £30,000 damages. Joan Dufosse, 73, was having a photo taken with her family at the company's flagship store in Oxford Street when she stepped on an icicle-shaped Christmas tree bauble and was sent crashing to the ground. Mrs Dufosse, of Richlans Road, Hedge End, Southampton, fractured her left thigh and had to be rushed to hospital. Fractured her thigh: Joan Dufosse lies slumped on the ground after slipping on a stray plastic icicle in the Selfridges Santa's Grotto. A judge said Santa and his elf should have spotted it . She needed major surgery to plate and screw the fracture and has yet to make a full recovery from the incident in November 2009. Mrs Dufosse, who was at Selfridges with . her son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren, claimed compensation . from Melbry Events Ltd, which ran the grotto, but had her claim rejected . by a judge at Southampton County Court in March. After a hearing in which 'Santa' David Warren and his 'elf' Sarah Chamberlain, were the star witnesses, Judge John Sparrow said the icicle was 'not in plain view' and cleared Melbry Events of blame for Mrs Dufosse's pre-Christmas catastrophe. But that decision has now been . reversed at London's Civil Appeal Court, where Lord Justice Rix, Sir . Mark Potter and Lord Justice McFarlane ruled that the 'offending icicle' should have been spotted by Santa or his little helper. Opening Mrs Dufosse's appeal, her . barrister, John Bate-Williams, said: 'This case may have entertaining . ingredients, but this accident had very serious consequences for Mrs . Dufosse.' 'We were warned off by Judge Sparrow . from any lightheartedness and so we were unable to use the phrase ""elf . and safety""', added Mr Bate-Williams as he handed the icicle up to the . bench for the three judges' perusal. Attacking . Judge Sparrow's decision to dismiss Mrs Dufosse's claim, the barrister . said: 'There was no justification for the finding that the bauble was . partly hidden. Even if it was partly concealed, the defendants should . have noticed it. 'It . was not the family's responsibility to see this icicle. They had the . excitement of grandchildren going to see Father Christmas and a very . pretty elf beckoning them in. Grotto: Santa in his chair at the 2009 Selfridges Christmas event . 'It . is absolutely the responsibility of the elf and father Christmas at all . times to keep the grotto clean and tidy,' he told the court. Sir . Mark Potter, giving his assessment of the case, said: 'The family went . in, preceded by the elf. Santa was there on his throne. There were eight . people in a three-by-four metre room. Two elves outside the grotto in Oxford Street's Selfridges in 2009. Mrs Dufosse has not recovered fully since the fall . 'There are 10 or 11,000 customers going through (the grotto) in the course of a season. Its a factory environment essentially. 'It . doesn't strain credulity that Father Christmas, left alone after . possibly the 33rd visit of the day, didn't do a radar sweep to see . whether there is an unexpected icicle.' Lord . Justice Rix, allowing Mrs Dufosse's appeal, said Santa or the elf ought . to have seen the stray icicle, and dismissed claims that the . grandmother was partly to blame for not spotting it herself. He . praised the 'excellence of the system' of safety checks Melbry Events . had in place, but went on to conclude that human error by Santa and the . elf had led to the accident. 'Mrs Dufosse fell and injured her leg. Why had she fallen, and was it anything to do with breach of statutory duties or negligence?' the judge asked. 'On the findings, the icicle was there and it was tripped over. The question is whether it was there to be seen.' He added: 'This was a 72-year-old . woman going with her family and grandchildren on what was, for all of . them, an exciting visit to Santa's Grotto in which the anticipated . pleasure of the children would have been foremost in their minds,' he . went on. 'There were eight . people in quite a small space. The accident happened when Mrs Dufosse, . at the request of the elf, stepped sideways and backward into the . corner. Still magical: Children at this year's grotto at Selfridges which opened to record sales last month . 'It was not her duty in these circumstances to ensure there were no tripping hazards in the room which might cause something amiss. This was purely the duty of Santa and the elf.' The . other judges agreed with his ruling, and the company was ordered to pay . the legal costs of the case. The exact amount of damages Mrs Dufosse . will receive will now be either agreed or assessed at a further court . hearing, but it is believed it could be up to £30,000.","Jean Dufosse fractured her hip after tripping on a stray plastic icicle .

"By . Nick Mcdermott, Fiona Macrae and Ryan Kisiel . Last updated at 4:41 PM on 19th December 2011 . Wards have been forced to close and visiting hours restricted in 35 hospitals in an effort to contain the dangerous winter vomiting bug which is sweeping Britain. Cases of norovirus, which causes violent vomiting and diarrhoea, are on the rise and have been reported at 35 hospitals in the past fortnight. Half of the cases have so far been confirmed by laboratory tests and 27 wards have been closed as a result. With further cold weather ahead, experts warn the illness could continue to spread. Steer clear: People who think they may have the norovirus are advised to stay away from hospitals (File photo) It is estimated that up to a million people each year are affected by the virus which can spread rapidly, particularly in crowded environments such as hospitals, residential care homes and schools. Occasionally it can be fatal, especially if contracted by those who are already unwell. Hospitals in London, Warwick, Redditch, Doncaster, Winchester, Bedford, Burton, Southampton, Chester, Somerset and Newport in Wales have been forced to close wards. On the Isle of Wight, patients with symptoms of the bug have been warned to stay away from hospital, and are instead being treated in their homes. Carol Alstrom, the chief nurse at St Mary’s Hospital on the island, said: ‘It is vitally important for people to keep away from hospital and nursing or residential care homes if they have been unwell with vomiting and or diarrhoea recently.’ Also affected: A ward at Queens Hospital in Burton, and a 14-bed ward at the University Hospital Southampton Trust. The Countess of Chester Hospital has visiting restrictions at four wards. Four wards at Weston General Hospital have restricted access . Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of microbiology at Aberdeen University, said that despite advances in medicine, treatments for norovirus have not improved in the past century. ‘We have to fall back on traditional barrier nursing – isolation of patients and treating their symptoms, all things we could have done 100 years ago,’ he said. ‘For most people, norovirus is mild. But for the very elderly and the elderly with other health problems, it is the last straw for some of them.’ He added that most people do not bother their GP about the condition and so official figures are notoriously low. But for every one case in official statistics, it is likely there are many more. Norovirus, which is most prevalent in winter, is highly contagious and can live on tiles, curtains and carpets for weeks. There are also fears that a new strain is on the march. As well as vomiting and diarrhoea, other symptoms include a raised temperature, headaches, stomach cramps and aching limbs. A Health Protection Agency spokesman said: ‘Anyone who thinks they may have norovirus should not go to their doctor’s surgery or A&E as this could spread the illness to vulnerable people and healthcare workers. ‘People who are unwell should ensure they take plenty of drinks to replace lost fluids.’ The HPA also advises people to wash hands thoroughly and regularly at all times, but particularly after using the toilet and before eating. Those who are ill should not visit friends or relatives in hospitals or residential care homes.","Hospitals in London, Warwick, Redditch, .

In demand: BlackBerry handsets are very popular with teenagers but now the company behind the brand is being asked to explain why people are able to download illegal content . BlackBerry has been ordered to a summit meeting with Ofcom to explain why children are still able to download pornography on its phones. Young people are able to download pornography through the popular handset even if their phone operator has installed a filter because data flows through the BlackBerry’s own server. Research In Motion, the company behind the BlackBerry, will be joined by other leading phone networks at the meeting called by the telecommunications regulator. An Ofcom spokesman told The Telegraph: ‘It was brought to our attention that there is a problem. It is to do with the way the operating system works. We are very concerned and want to get this resolved as quickly as possible.’ Mobile phone networks have been able to apply filters to other handsets, such as the iPhone, but because of data flows through the BlackBerry’s own services leading operators have been unable to block pornography on the popular phone. The phone is hugely popular with teenagers, mainly because of its BlackBerry messenger service, many of its of its eight million users are believed to be under 18. Tory MP Claire Perry, for Devizes,has said she is so alarmed at children having access to pornography she has vowed to raise the issue in parliament. Filter: Research In Motion has denied it asked mobile operators to pay for a pornographic block on handsets . It is the second blow to the company's reputation as this summer BlackBerry executives were hauled before MPs to explain how their service came to be so popular with rioters trying to dodge police. Barring certain sites is standard procedure in the phone industry, which prides itself on its success with this form of self-regulation. But mobile phone networks previously told Financial Mail that RIM demanded they pay to have bars installed on their customers’ BlackBerrys, something that is not standard practice. Only T-Mobile is believed to have had a bar in place for BlackBerry users. RIM, though, said this was not so, that it had never demanded money for installing the blocking software and referred questions on the issue back to the networks.","BlackBerry hauled before Ofcom to explain why young people are able to download pornography .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:59 PM on 18th December 2011 . London Mayor Boris Johnson said European leaders should abandon 'hysterical' efforts to rescue the eurozone and recognise that some countries have to drop the single currency. 'I would be amazed if we were all sitting here next year and the euro had not undergone some sort of change,' he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show. 'I think it highly likely that there will be a realignment in the sense that some countries will fall out... and we all know who the likely candidates are. Three wise men: London Mayor Boris Johnson (left) appeared on the Andrew Marr show alongside Lord Mandelson (centre) and Business Secretary Vince Cable (right) 'But there is such phobia about this and such a lot of political ego has been invested in the success of the euro project that people are failing to see that might be the best way forward. 'If we continually go on with these hysterical attempts to bubble gum the whole thing together we are just going to consign those periphery economies particularly to low growth and we are never going to get confidence back in the eurozone.' The senior Tory played down calls for an immediate referendum on UK membership of the EU - saying it would be required if there was a 'treaty change that substantially affects the UK'. 'There is no immediate reason as far as I can see to get embroiled in an in/out referendum,' he added. Interviewing Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable, Mr Marr asked: 'Even Boris Johnson conceded or suggested that the use of the British veto, which he was in favour of... hadn’t actually put the City in a stronger position, or British financial services in a more protected position, is that what you think too?' Mr Cable replied: 'That’s correct and Boris Johnson was right, as a matter of fact the position is unchanged. Warning: Italy's Prime Minister 'Super' Mario . Monti (left) has been told Italy could be hit with a credit downgrade in . the near future, as French President Nicolas Sarkozy (right) was warned . France could lose its AAA-rating . 'It was largely political, certainly the Prime Minister has got a short-term boost from it, but it doesn’t actually deal with the big long-term fundamental problems in Europe.' Asked if he contemplated resignation at any time during the crisis over the EU veto, Mr Cable said 'No'. He added: 'I frequently wonder about my position in Government because we’re all making difficult decisions, but when I reflect on it as I do, I realise that what we’re committed to is actually making this Government work, we’ve got to deal with the very serious problems in the economy.' The comments came as David Cameron's hardline stance over the eurozone treaty appeared to have secured a significant boost in public opinion - as the Tories opened up a six-point poll lead over Labour. A survey, conducted as the political fallout from his use of the UK’s veto at the Brussels summit convulsed the coalition, put the premier's party up two points with Labour dropping the same amount. The 40 per cent to 34 per cent gap is among the biggest since the immediate aftermath of the 2010 general election and marks the highest Tory approval rating for more than 18 months. Warning: Rating agency Fitch has told the European Central Bank to take a more active 'firefighting role' The Liberal Democrats, whose MPs abstained en masse in protest at what they saw as a damaging outcome to single currency crisis talks, were unchanged on 14 per cent in the ICM/Sunday Telegraph poll. It also suggested Mr Cameron could face growing demands for a referendum on the EU following his dramatic withdrawal from the deal agreed by most of the other member states last week. A 58 per cent majority of those polled backed the move, with more than one in three (35 per cent) wanting a vote within a year. As credit ratings agencies cast fresh doubt on efforts to end the euro crisis, it was reported that evacuating expats formed part of emergency plans being drawn up by the Foreign Office. The Sunday Times said officials were concerned that around a million Britons living in Spain and Portugal could be trapped without access to cash if banks in the eurozone countries collapsed. Preparing: Nick Clegg is getting ready to launch a fresh dig at Tory eurosceptics . It quoted officials saying the worst case scenario was being prepared for - with possible transport routes out and emergency loans among measures being examined. A spokeswoman said: 'Officials continue to contingency plan for a range of possible scenarios.' It came as Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg prepared to launch a fresh dig at Tory eurosceptics - criticising the influence of 'narrow nationalism' over 'enlightened internationalism'. The Liberal Democrat leader will take to the TV studios for the second weekend in a row today as he battles to assert his party’s position after the difficulties caused by the euro row. Yesterday he urged eurosceptics not to exploit the eurozone crisis to foster 'xenophobia, chauvinism and polarisation' as fresh doubts were cast on efforts to save the single currency. Credit rating agency Fitch said it believed that a comprehensive solution was now 'technically and politically beyond reach' despite last week’s agreement on a rescue package. Tory former chancellor Lord Lamont warned that time was running out to develop sufficiently strong measures to prevent the euro from a fatal 'explosion'. In moves that will be closely watched by markets, Fitch put the ratings of six countries - Belgium, Spain, Slovenia, Italy, Ireland and Cyprus - under review. It also dropped France's economic outlook from stable to negative - meaning it believes the country is more likely than not to lose its cherished AAA credit rating within two years. Paris was delivered a diplomatic slap by the Deputy Prime Minister on Friday for 'simply unacceptable' attacks on the UK economy by a series of senior politicians and officials. Its prime minister and central bank chief were among figures publicly suggesting the UK was a better candidate for any downgrade of its credit rating. Mr Clegg has welcomed what he said were encouraging steps towards ensuring the UK was not isolated in Europe, including an agreement that British officials will take part in 'technical discussions' over the formation of the new rules on debt and deficit limits and a softening of opposition to the use of EU institutions in developing them. The European Court of Justice will enforce what are meant to be strict central controls on the economies of participating member states. Hungary and the Czech Republic have said they will not join the new agreement unless plans for tax harmonisation were dropped as signs of cracks among the other 26 nations appeared. ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,008 adults by telephone on December 14-15 and the results were weighted to the profile of all adults. It follows a YouGov poll for The Sun which gave the Tories a two-point lead over Labour and another by ComRes for The Independent poll putting the main parties neck-and-neck on 38 per cent.

Sprightly Albert Keates is still plugging leaks as Britain's oldest plumber, 65 years and 68,000 faulty taps after his first job. The 80-year-old, from Southampton, earned just three pence an hour in his first job in 1946, working as an apprentice on new-build houses. But now after clocking up over six decades in his trade, the married father-of-two charges £42 an hour plus VAT for his years of experience at his own firm. Going strong: Albert Keates, 80, started plumbing aged 15 and has since clocked up 68,000 fixed leaky taps . Young apprentice: Albert, pictured aged 18 in 1950, earned just three pence an hour in his first plumbing job . Albert worked for several companies in his home city of Southampton before setting up on his own in July 1967. At his peak, he employed seven other plumbers. He has out-lived many customers and has some who have been with him since his very first day in business. Albert, who is also a qualified electrician, said: 'I secured a plumbing apprenticeship after leaving school aged 15 and have been in the trade ever since. 'I don't know anybody who has been doing it longer. 'I have turned my hand to all aspects of plumbing in that time and see it as an art form. I want to be proud of every job I do. Long-serving: Albert said he could carry on plumbing for ever because of his love of the job and the people he meets . 'Things have changed a lot over the years. It used to be a craft but it has now become a science because technology has taken over. 'When I started out, tips and tricks were passed down from master to apprentice - but now it has been formalised by colleges and redtape.'

"By . Glen Owen . Last updated at 12:56 AM on 11th December 2011 . Problem families are each costing the taxpayer an astonishing £75,000 every year, new figures reveal today. Ministers have been horrified by research showing that on average £9billion is spent each year on 120,000 families blighted by jobless parents and truanting children. More than two-thirds of this is devoted to protecting children – via social care and child support – and tackling the crime and anti-social behaviour such families often generate. Costly: Police say it is sometimes cheaper to permanently station a police officer at a troublesome family's home than to continually respond to call-outs . Police have said that in some cases . it would be cheaper to have an officer permanently stationed at a . family’s home than respond to constant call-outs. The . findings come ahead of a major speech later this week by David Cameron . in which he is expected to announce new sanctions against such families . – combined with what sources describe as ‘targeted resources’ – as part . of his mission to tackle ‘broken Britain’. Researchers . devised a seven-point checklist of factors, with families that . fulfilled five or more being  designated as ‘problem’. Worrying trend: Researchers found that 63per cent of boys whose fathers are jailed will eventually be convicted themselves . Led astray: Teenagers raised in difficult home environments are 36 times more likely to be excluded from school than those from good families (posed by models) The . criteria include no one in the family being employed, neither parent . having any qualifications and being unable to afford certain basic food . or clothing items. The research reveals that teenagers raised in such families are 36 times more likely to be excluded from school than children in families with no problems. They are also six times more likely to have been in care, while 63per cent of boys whose fathers are jailed will eventually be convicted themselves. Downing Street’s determination to deal with problem families has been strengthened by the need to make deep cuts to local authority budgets. Mission: PM David Cameron is set to announce new sanctions against unruly families as part of his bid to tackle 'broken Britain', while Communities Secretary Eric Pickles (right) said homes had been caught in a cycle of state dependency . One Whitehall source said: ‘We simply don’t have the money to spare. These families are a drain on local services, which could be much better directed elsewhere. ‘One local police force told us that it would actually be cheaper to have an officer permanently stationed on the family’s sofa than have to respond to the  constant call-outs to the house. ‘We need to get kids back in the classroom, and to get parents off drugs and on to a work programme to stop them committing crime.’ Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘For too long, these families have been locked in a cycle of state dependency. Worklessness has been passed down from generation to generation. 'Over the years, millions of pounds have been squandered on fruitless, unco-ordinated investment and we can no longer afford to foot the bill.’","Two-thirds spent protecting children and tackling crime .

A sacred tree which came back to life after it was nearly destroyed by vandals must now be replaced - thanks to trophy hunters who have broken off its new shoots. The Holy Thorn Tree in Glastonbury Somerset - which can trace its roots back 2,000 years to the death of Jesus - had its branches hacked off in December last year. It miraculously started to grow new shoots earlier this year and made a fragile recovery over the summer. Hacked off: The Holy Thorn in Glastonbury, Somerset. The sacred tree's fragile recovery from an attack by vandals has been put at risk by trophy hunters . But some of the new growth has now been removed and locals suspect trophy hunters will use them to try and grow their own holy tree. The tree was also damaged by ribbons tied around the trunk and coins and other items that have been shoved into the bark. Well-wishers have even poured honey, Guinness and cider around the roots, causing further damage. Local councillor John Coles, a former Mayor of Glastonbury, said it will be replaced with a new one grafted from the original branches which were hacked off. 'People don't realise the damage they are doing. I am forever removing these ribbons because they block sunlight to the trunk,' he said. 'We've had people pulling things off - the new growth and bark on the trunk. We think it would have survived if it was just left alone. 'There is still life in the trunk but we doubt that it will ever recover. It is very sad but we think the best thing is to replace it.' Green shoots: The embattled tree can trace its history back 2,000 years . The new tree has been grafted by experts at Kew Gardens and is likely to be planted nearby to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee next year. It could be monitored by a CCTV camera to prevent a repeat of the damage caused to the current tree, Mr Coles added. Experts have verified that the felled tree - known as the Crategus Monogyna Bi Flora - originated from the Middle East. Christian legend dictates that Jesus's great uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, came to Britain after the crucifixion 2,000 years ago bearing the Holy Grail - the cup used by Christ at the Last Supper. He visited Glastonbury and thrust his staff into Wearyall Hill, just below the Tor, planting a seed for the original thorn tree. Barren: Botanists from Kew hope to plant another tree carefully grafted from the old one nearby . Oliver Cromwell's Roundheads felled the tree during the English Civil War, when Parliament waged a vicious battle against the Crown. However, locals salvaged the roots of the original tree, hiding it in secret locations around Glastonbury. It was then replanted on the hill in 1951. Other cuttings were also grown and placed around the town - including its famous Glastonbury Abbey.",Replacement likely to be planted to mark Queen's Diamond Jubilee next year .

Parking officials have come under fire for refusing to cancel a fine given to a woman while she underwent emergency treatment to save her unborn baby. Heavily pregnant Sian Vaughan parked her car on a meter outside the hospital she attended for a routine appointment. She expected to return to her car an hour later but was admitted to a ward because she had the condition pre-eclampsia which could have been life-threatening to her baby. Fined: Sian Vaughan, pictured with baby Ollie, was given a £35 parking ticket because her car had over-stayed the permitted time on the meter . Mrs Vaughan remained in hospital and gave birth to healthy baby boy, Ollie, two days later. While she was in there she was given a £35 parking ticket because her car had over-stayed the permitted time on the meter. But she was stunned when she later appealed the fine and was knocked back by her local council because her circumstances did not justify cancelling the ticket. Mrs Vaughan, from Dorchester, said: 'At my appointment I was admitted there and then because my blood pressure was so high that there was a serious risk to me and the baby. 'There was nothing I could do about it, it was such a shock and I was on my own so it was scary. 'The last thing I was worrying about was moving my car. 'I knew I was in a restricted area but I thought if I explained the situation to the council they would understand. 'I’m not saying I didn’t do anything wrong but all I want is a bit of humanity. Do they really think I would put my baby’s life at risk to go out and move my car?' Mrs Vaughan, who has two other sons, Charlie, aged seven, and Jack, 15, later emailed the council to appeal the ticket which was issued outside the Dorset County Hospital in Dorchester. She said: 'I emailed the council to say I was sorry and explained I was admitted in an emergency and there was nothing I could do. 'They replied saying: ''We do appreciate and understand your circumstances but unfortunately hospital appointments can overrun. 'We have considered your case and are satisfied that the ticket was administered correctly.' 'The thing they don’t seem to understand is my appointment didn’t just overrun, it was a medical emergency. I had developed a condition called pre-eclampsia, and it can kill. 'I was being monitored because it was life threatening to me and my baby.' Mrs Vaughan, who runs Vaughan’s Bistro in Weymouth with her husband, was fined £35 to be paid within 14 days. She paid it as she didn't want to risk it rising to £70. She has received much support on an online forum where users have criticised the council. One commenter said: . 'So in other words, we can all drop dead just as long as the Dorset . County Council gets it’s money. I find that totally disgusting.' Another wrote: 'Clearly a brainless, compassionless muppet (sic) in DCC who fully deserves to have their job cut.' A third poster added: 'Typical . council attitude. But, they get away with it because they are the . council, unlike businesses that have to keep customers, they have a . monopoly and manage to abuse it at every opportunity. 'Remember, we all pay for this bunch of muppets.' A Dorset County Council spokesman said: 'The parking ticket was challenged through our website and, though we are sympathetic to the circumstances, we felt that the details given weren’t sufficient to justify cancelling the ticket. 'The ticket can still be challenged through official means as described on the back of the penalty charge notice.'",Dorset County Council says the circumstances do not justify cancelling the ticket .

Sold: The Roman statue - which depicts Leda and the Swan - has been kept at Aske Hall in North Yorkshire for 300 years and fetched £12.2million at auction . A statue left languishing as ‘just part of the furniture’ by its owners has been sold at auction for £12.2million. The 4ft 5in marble depiction of Leda and the Swan had been in the family of the Marquess of Zetland for more than 200 years – and may even have spent some time as a garden ornament. But no one thought to have it valued until it was spotted by an antiquities specialist at the family seat of Aske Hall, North Yorkshire. He found it dated to second century Imperial Rome, and estimated its value at £1.2million. But when it was finally sold in New York it prompted a bidding war and went for ten times that. A source at the hall said: 'The family knew it was old and that it was Roman but they had no idea of its true value.' So unaware of the statue's pedigree was the Marquess and his family that it spent decades outside masquerading as a garden ornament before it was finally taken inside for good around 40 years ago. The sculpture was one of four antiquities bought in Rome by the 1st Earl on behalf of his father. It does not appear in any of the major surveys of ancient marble sculpture in English country houses, but is mentioned in Robinson’s Guide to Richmond of 1833. Aske Hall has an impressive collection of historic furniture, paintings and porcelain. The most prized of the ancient antiquities bought in Rome by the 1st Earl - a statue of the Lysippean Eros - was stolen. It was taken from the grounds of Aske Hall in the 1970s and has never been recovered. The sculpture was offered for auction by the will trust of the 3rd Marquess of Zetland, Lawrence Dundas, who was chairman of Catterick and Redcar racecourses and died in 1989. Grand: Aske Hall is owned by the Marquess Of Zetland, who only found out that the sculpture dated back to the 2nd Century after an antiquities expert made a routine visit to the estate .","The Marquess Of Zetland only found out the sculpture - which depicts Leda and the Swan - dated back to the 2nd Century .

Diane Cervelli, 42, and Taeko Bufford, 28, tried to book a room at Aloha Bed & Breakfast in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2007. But when Ms Cervelli informed owner Phyllis Young that the California couple would only need one bed, she was asked if it was because they were lesbians, according to a lawsuit filed yesterday. Ms Young then said she was uncomfortable having lesbians in her house because of her religious views, it is claimed. Lawsuit: Taeko Bufford (left) and Diane Cervelli are suing a Honolulu hotel for discrimination after the owner 'denied them a room because they are lesbians' Refusing to let the couple book a room . was solely based on their sexual orientation because the owner indicated . that if they were married, she would still not have allowed them to stay . there, according to their attorney Peter Renn. She also would have had a problem if they were an unmarried . heterosexual couple, he added.

The . couple ended up booking a room elsewhere in Honolulu, but the . experience with the bed and breakfast 'soured' their trip, Ms Cervelli . said yesterday.

Ms Young declined to comment yesterday, She is being legally represented by the Alliance Defense Fund, an organisation of attorneys representing people whose religious freedom is infringed. According to the lawsuit, the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission has investigated the incident. During the investigation, Ms Young told the commission that homosexuality is 'detestable' and 'defiles our land'. The commission issued a notice of 'reasonable cause to believe that unlawful discriminatory practices have been committed' and notified the couple of their right to sue. The lawsuit wants the business to be ordered to comply with the law, for the court to issue a declaration making clear what happened was illegal and for the couple to be awarded unspecified monetary compensation, . Mr Renn, the couple's lawyer, said: 'No amount of money is going to erase the humiliation and pain.'

Absolute Poker co-owner Brent Beckley, 31, was at a New York court today and is one of 12 people charged in a case seeking $3billion in penalties. In April the U.S. government seized the domain names of the three largest online poker companies - Absolute Poker, Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars. Gaming chain: The co-founder of Absolute Poker, one of the largest online poker companies, has admitted deceiving U.S. banks (file picture) Beckley said he accepted credit cards from players from 2006 to 2011  so they could bet online and he disguised the purpose of the payments. 'I knew that it was illegal to accept credit cards from players to gamble on the internet,' Beckley said  in Manhattan federal court on Monday. 'I knew that it was illegal to deceive the banks in this way,' he told U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald Ellis. Beckley hired so-called ‘payment processor’ Ira Rubin between 2008 and 2011 to help the company avoid U.S. gambling laws, an indictment said. Rubin would allegedly process e-cheques for Absolute Poker disguised as payroll processing, affiliate marketing and for fake online merchants. Betting: In April the U.S. government seized the domain names of the three largest online poker firms - Absolute Poker, Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars (file picture) Rubin, who lived in Central America for years to avoid a telemarketing fraud charge, is close to a plea agreement, his lawyer Robert Cleary said. 'I knew it was illegal to deceive the banks in this way' Brent Beckley . Beckley pleaded guilty to conspiring to break U.S. laws against online gambling and conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud. The bank fraud charge carries a jail sentence of up to 30 years, but under a plea agreement he will likely serve only up to 18 months. Full Tilt Poker owner Raymond Bitar, PokerStars owner Isai Scheinberg and Absolute Poker owners Beckley and Scott Tom were also charged. Under fire: The U.S. government also filed a civil lawsuit against the Full Tilt Poker website and professional players Howard Lederer, left, and Christopher Ferguson . Prosecutors detailed what happened to at least one-third of the billions of dollars the poker companies allegedly tricked U.S. banks into processing. The money allegedly went directly to the firms as revenue through the ‘rake’ charged to players on almost every poker hand played online. The government also filed a civil lawsuit against the Full Tilt Poker website and professional players Howard Lederer and Christopher Ferguson. Government officials accused them and others of paying themselves more than $440million while defrauding other players. Absolute Poker is based in Costa Rica.

"By . Fiona Macrae . Last updated at 4:38 PM on 20th December 2011 . Tens of thousands of women with breast implants are being urged to have medical check-ups amid fears they are at heightened risk of cancer. The safety alert follows the death of a French woman who had implants filled with silicone gel believed to have been made for mattresses. Up to 50,000 British women – including some breast cancer survivors – have the French-made implants, which are fragile and more likely to leak than other brands. Edwige Ligoneche was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer two years after having breast surgery using a French-made silicone gel. (See box below) Fears about the safety of Poly Implants Prothèses – or PIPs – which were among the cheapest implants on the market, first surfaced 18 months ago. However, they receded after tests failed to find any firm evidence that the implants could trigger cancer. Now, the death of 53-year-old Edwige Ligoneche, in a Marseille cancer clinic, from a rare form of cancer, has reignited concern. Although the link with the implants . hasn’t been established, it is feared that the gel leaked out of her . breasts and into her system. The French Society of Reconstructive and Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons says the gel could have been an ‘aggravating factor’ in the cancer. It is reviewing its policy on the implants. Their British counterparts have urged women not to worry – but say that patients who have, or suspect they have these implants, should have regular scans to check for flaws and cracks. If there are signs of damage, implants on both sides should be removed. Some GPs may be happy to refer women for an ultrasound, otherwise they will have to pay for it privately. The . NHS does take out damaged implants but won’t pay for new ones to be put . in, meaning patients could be left with a bill that runs into thousands . of pounds – as well as the trauma of additional surgery. The alarm was first raised in France after surgeons noticed that PIP implants were rupturing much more quickly than other more expensive brands. An inquiry ordered by the French health watchdog reported ‘serious’ irregularities in the implants last summer. Among other things, when the gel’s manufacturer was asked for studies on its safety, it said it did not have any – because it believed it was to be used in the manufacture of mattresses. In 2009, the French government agency responsible for medical equipment safety standards, Afssaps, received a number of complaints about the PIP implants. An inquiry ordered by the French health watchdog reported 'serious' irregularities in the implants last summer (posed by models) Afssaps found that 10 per cent of the company’s implants ruptured within a year. On average, implants should last at least 10 years. In Britain, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which is responsible for the safety of drugs and medical devices, told surgeons to stop using the implants. Subsequent tests appeared to rule out any risk of cancer or  poisoning and the MHRA said patients should be reassured that there is ‘no current evidence’ of a health risk. Last night, the MHRA said that breast implants have also been linked to cancer in America. A spokesman added that any woman concerned that her implants has ruptured should speak to the surgeon who put them in for her. British plastic surgeons said the fault lies at the door of the manufacturer, who has now gone into liquidation. Fazel Fatah, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: ‘It is important to remember that the number of breast implant patients globally is considered to be higher than ten million, yet these tumours are extremely rare. ‘In relation to PIPs, we continue to reiterate our advice to UK patients in line with the French authorities: if you have, or suspect you have these implants, you should have a scan every six months. ‘If there is any rupture or weakening, have both implants removed.’",Alert follows death of French woman who had implants with silicone gel 'made for mattresses'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:25 AM on 16th December 2011 . A young woman whose life is blighted by an allergy to water has told  how she can't even watch a weepy film, because her own tears bring her out in a painful rash. Katie Dell, 26, is one of only about 35 people in the world diagnosed with the rare allergy aquagenic urticaria. It means she can't have long soaks in the bath, go swimming, or cry without triggering a burning rash on her skin. Stuck indoors: Katie avoids going out when it's raining as it brings her out in itchy hives . Her condition often leaves her too scared to leave her home in case it rains. Katie, from Flint, North Wales, has even had to give up her job as a dance teacher because sweat also causes a reaction. But she can't get upset and cry - because her tears also cause a painful reaction on her face. Katie said: 'I can't even watch a weepy rom-com film like most girls and I've missed out on a lot of the classics like E.T and The Notebook. 'If I feel I'm going to cry, I turn it off and I've missed the end to so many films. 'Symptoms began after I had my tonsils out when I was about 16. 'After the operation I had penicillin that I later discovered I was allergic to. Doctors think this may have altered the histamine levels in my body.' Katie said she soon noticed that she developed a rash every time she came into contact with water. The condition is so rare that doctors thought at first that Katie was making it up. Painful: Katie comes up in a rash after a brief shower . She said: 'By the time I reached 20, it was at the point I wanted to dig my nails into my skin. 'But doctors still looked at me like I was telling fibs and people would tell me it was all in my head, even though I was in agony. I felt like I was going mad.' It was only when she moved from Suffolk to Flint two years ago that Katie finally got a diagnosis. Her new GP thought it was Aquagenic urticaria and referred her to a specialist. She was diagnosed by a dermatology specialist at Glan Clwyd Hospital in October this year. She said: 'I thought I had been allergic to chemicals and I changed my soap, shampoo and conditioner. 'I looked on the net and found people with a similar condition called perusis so I changed my diet, started taking hayfever tablets, putting soda in the bath, even trying herbal remedies, but nothing worked. 'I was glad when I got the diagnosis because I thought I was going mad. 'The condition has, and will continue, to get progressively worse. 'It started with an itchy neck. Now I have hives, a rash and painful, itching skin which can reduce me to tears, but I refuse to cry - well I try, as that affects me as well, leaving me with a red itchy face. 'I do get quite depressed and I'm hooked on looking at the weather if I dare leave the house. 'I usually end up cancelling appointments because of the rain and I find it hard to have a social life.' Katie has even had to give up her job as a dance teacher because sweat also causes a reaction . Katie said she used to enjoy having a long soak in the bath, but now she is only able to spend no more than a couple of minutes in the shower, and needs the help of her husband, Andy, 31, a delivery driver. She said: 'I have to be really quick so Andy washes my hair and I wash my body. After, I can't go anywhere for about two hours because it's just too painful. 'Andy is amazing - we have been together 11 years and he's been fantastic about my condition. 'He does everything from putting the wet washing out on the line, to washing up, to doing the grocery shopping when it's raining. I can't thank him enough.' There is currently no cure for aquagenic urticaria and Katie says she has accepted that she is likely to have the condition for the rest of her life. She said: 'Just thinking about the things I will miss in my life because of the rain, sweat or because I may cry, brings a tear to my eye but the most upsetting thing is that it's progressive and I hate to think what it will be like in five years' time if they don't find a cure. 'But I hate to be defeated so I refuse to cry and refuse to get down because life goes on. 'I would love to swim with dolphins, go to the Disney water park and most of all own a hot tub. We can all dream.' Lindsey McManus, allergy expert for Allergy UK, said the condition can be triggered by a number of different reasons, from water temperature to chemicals in water. She said: 'Aquagenic urticaria is a relatively rare condition. Urticaria is notoriously difficult to diagnose and symptoms include an itchy nettlerash (hives). 'However, not all forms of urticaria have an allergic component, it could be caused by a physical reaction to things like heat or exercise. It is usually treated by a course of anti-histamines. 'However, we would recommend the patient visits their GP for referral to a specialist dermatology or allergy clinic, in the first instance,' she said.","Katie can't have a bath, go swimming, or even go out in the rain .

Maxim Lonhienne, who lives in the 200,000 population city, said: 'When I heard and saw this, I was really touched by this tragedy and it is to give homage that I am here.' At the end of the ceremony, subdued applause rippled across the square as Crown Prince Philippe and Princess Mathilde left. Authorities said they still do not know what motivated Amrani. Before the attack, he also shot a cleaner dead and dumped her body in a shed he owned. It is unknown if that killing was connected to the rampage, but police believe he may have attempted to rape her. Prosecutor Cedric Visart de Bocarme told RTL television: 'We are trying to find out who this person really is and how someone who did not give any sign of mental difficulties could have acted in this way.' Amrani, who spent time in prison for offences involving guns and drugs, had been called in for questioning in a sexual abuse case on the day of the shooting.

Britain has been rated the world’s fifth most charitable country. It moved up from eighth place last year in a study of 153 nations carried out by the Charities Aid Foundation. The U.S. came top of the World Giving Index 2011 – which ranks nations based on how likely citizens are to donate money, volunteer their time and help strangers – followed by Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. The Netherlands was sixth, with the top ten completed by  Canada, Sri Lanka, Thailand  and Laos. Despite the squeeze on income, 79 per . cent of Britons give money to charity each month, up from 73 per cent . in 2010, according to the research. This is at a time when the Government . has controversially vowed to maintain levels of overseas aid despite . austerity measures at home. The survey found that only Thais were more generous than Britons, with 85 per cent likely to make a regular charitable donation. Ireland and the Netherlands were jointly third on 75 per cent. Some 28 per cent of the UK population volunteer time each month (down from 29 per cent last year) and 63 per cent help a stranger (up from 58 per cent). Worldwide there was a 2 per cent increase in people helping strangers and a 1 per cent increase in volunteering over the past 12 months, but a 1 per cent drop in giving to charity, the study based on Gallup polling data discovered. John Low, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation,  said: ‘It is amazing that during these tough economic times an overwhelming majority of the UK population gives to charity. ‘It shows just how deep-seated the idea of charity and charitable giving is in our society. 'However, there is always more that can be done.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:04 AM on 20th December 2011 . A charity earns less than £4.50 a year from each of its shoe recycling bins despite attracting thousands of tons of donations from the public. The Variety Club – famous for its Sunshine coaches – has a network of 7,000 branded collection points in supermarket car parks, offices and local authority tips across the country. Their familiar love heart logo encourages the public to believe their donation goes towards helping sick, disabled and disadvantaged children. The law says the shoe banks should have a breakdown of where the money goes . But the European Recycling Company, which operates the bins, is understood to have donated only £30,000 to the charity in the past 12 months. That is an improvement on 2009 when it gave only £5,500 to the Variety Club while published accounts suggested the firm made profits of more than £350,000. The network of collection points is believed to generate an average of £1.9million annually in shoe sales for ERC, which is part of the German recycling conglomerate Soex Textil. Alistair McLean, chief executive of watchdog the Fundraising Standards Board, said: ‘This is a commercial contract between the Variety Club and the ERC. It is down to the charity to negotiate the best possible contract. ‘But on the face of it this does not appear to be a good deal.’ The watchdog is investigating whether the Variety Club branded recycling bins break the law by not detailing how the proceeds of public donations are split. An ERC spokesman said the company had a ‘very, very small margin’ on the shoes, meaning that it ‘cannot afford to pay more’ to the Variety Club. ERC believes the figure for donations to the charity will rise to £35,000 for this calendar year. The Variety Club has defended the use of it logo on the ERC recycling bins, claiming the money raised has helped ‘thousands of sick, disabled or disadvantaged kids’. Nerses Ohanian's ERC processes the show bank donations . 'The ratio is ridiculous,' said Bozena Przybyla, 56, who was giving a pair of shoes to a Variey Club bank at Tesco in Edmonton, north London. 'Obviously they have expenses, but I thought that at least 60 per cent of the proceeds would go to poor people.' ERC is controlled by Nerses Ohanian, whose German and Swiss-based businesses makes millions a year in profits from textile recycling under the Soex brand. His registered headquarters are in the Swiss tax haven of Zug. Mr Ohanian from ERC said: 'Whatever we pay to the charity, we have a very, very small margin and we cannot afford to pay more. 'It is very hard to pay full freight, pair the shoes, sort them and to make money. Yes, we make money, but two to three years ago it was much better because productivity per box has gone way down. 'The question is, do we pay the charity right? I don’t know how much they pay, if there is more then we have to improve to pay more, but I can tell you the profitability on recycling is 10 per cent to 15 per cent gross margin.' ERC said that in 2010 it donated more than £19,000 from the Variety Club shoe collection. Turnover that year was just over £2m, according to figures seen by the Guardian which ERC would not confirm or deny. Mr Ohanian's German company, Soex Textil, which recycles clothes for the German Red Cross, made close to £7m in underlying profits on sales of more than £60m in 2009, according to accounts filed in Germany. Ohanian is listed on the accounts as the sole director of ERC, but described himself as a 'passive shareholder'. He said Soex's chief executive, Andy Haws, has responsibility for its management. 'People see the Variety Club and they say ""Every shoe I put in here, its value will go through to the Variety Club"",' Mr Haws said. 'Well, no, because you have operational profits, the same as the Salvation Army has, the same as Oxfam has. 'We are growing and we will continue to give bigger donations to the Variety Club. We are increasing our collections through development. 'We run a commercial business and it is important the business is sustainable and continues to grow and continues our growth to the Variety Club. 'We are not misleading, we have never misled, we have always been extremely open with the Variety Club.'","European Recycling Company donated £5,500 to the Variety Club in 2009 - while making a profit of £350,000 ."

Daniel McGill, 21, and Gordon Alexander, 30, were jailed for a total of 19 years after Daniel Kaye found them on the social networking site. The pair threatened the victim, 18, with a blade and demanded that he hand over his mobile phone and cash when he pulled over to answer a call. Jailed: Daniel McGill, 21, and Gordon Alexander, 30, were both caught after being tracked down on Facebook . The thugs then cheekily ordered him to take off his t-shirt so they could polish his vehicle to remove their fingerprints in Darlington, County Durham. After being traumatised by the attack, Mr Kaye searched Facebook for the people he thought were responsible for robbing him and found a picture of McGill. He is believed to have been able to carry out the search because he recognised the attacker from the area. By looking through the victim's Facebook friends, he was also able to name Alexander as one of the attackers, Teeside Crown Court heard. A third person involved in the robbery has not been traced. As they were jailed, McGill and Alexander cheered, whooped and laughed sarcastically. Mr Kaye, an IT apprentice, . said he still . had nightmares about the attack. 'It was probably the most . scared I’ve ever been in my life,' he said after the sentencing. Knifepoint attack: The robbery happened close to this road in Darlington . 'Having someone hold a knife to you is . not something you ever want to happen. 'It still affects me. I have a . lot of sleepless nights. I don’t go anywhere now without checking . whether it’s safe to get out of the car. 'For a long time, I couldn’t . relax. I’m a happy go-lucky guy. I’ve turned it round and want to put it . behind me now.' McGill, from Darlington, was given seven years behind bars after being found guilty of robbing Mr Kaye on July 15 this year. He had denied any involvement. Alexander, of no fixed address, was given 12 years as he was sentenced for two robberies and an attempted robbery. A fortnight later he struck again in Darlington town centre when he knocked a 30-year-old man out with a knuckleduster during a violent attack. The court heard that McGill also had a criminal past. Judge Peter Fox told them: 'You both . have bad records. There are a number of aggravating features to the . first robbery . . . you were hunting in a pack with a third young man. 'You, McGill, were actually using a . knife, inches away from your victim. It was at night. It was a cowardly . attack in a public place. He fell into your predatory hands.' Alexander’s barrister, Martin Towers, . said: 'These convictions represent his first for offences of robbery, . but I have to concede, he has a bad record.' Dan Cordey, for McGill, said: 'While . he is facing his first adult custodial sentence, he is not somebody who . this court should give up on. He can work.' After the pair were led away . cheering, the judge said: 'For anyone who may wish to review this matter . subsequently, I can only observe the laughter which I hear from the . corridor behind the court.'","Daniel McGill, 21, and Gordon Alexander, 30, given a total of 19 years behind bars .

So popular is this family of boar that they have managed to avoid the chop in the Forest of Dean's culling programme. But not for much longer, as they could only have a few months left to live before being slaughtered. This particular group of six have been given a death sentence after the Forestry Commission decided they would no longer be excluded from the cull - a move which is expected to spark outcry among their fans. Death sentence: Some of the Beechenhurst Six graze near the visitor center near Cinderford, blissfully unaware of the fate that could await them . Out on a limb: Forestry Commission bosses have confirmed the boars' exclusion from previous culls will come to an end in March next year . The animals have become a firm . favourite with visitors to the Gloucestershire beauty spot's . Beechenhurst tourist centre near Cinderford. The . boar - dubbed the Beechenhurst Six - are often seen grubbing for food . in the grounds surrounding the tourist centre, and have built up quite a . following. So far they have been spared from any culling by the Forestry Commission over to concerns at opposition to the move. However . Forestry Commission bosses have now confirmed their exclusion from . previous culls will come to an end in March next year. A . spokesman said: 'A decision was taken back in the summer, when local . people were focused on this particular family of boar, not to cull them . as part of the overall cull of wild boar. 'A . new cull target will be set in March 2012 based upon the best available . information. It does not follow that these particular animals will be . either targeted or not targeted in 2012/13.' Common problems: The Forest of Dean has long had a population of wild boar (pictured) but environmentalists have called for a closed season on hunting the boar to help them flourish . Pricey problem: It costs the Forestry Commission £50,000 a year to cull boar in Dean . Cinderford's Labour councillor Graham Morgan, said: 'There could well be a public outcry if that family of boar is culled. 'People have taken them into their hearts. The thing is, people have been feeding them, which then domesticates them. 'People would help them more by not feeding them. They get too familiar with people if they get fed, and that’s when the problems start.' He added: 'I personally think the cull . was too heavy to start off with. We want wild boar in the Forest and . they need to be managed, but perhaps there weren’t as many as the . Forestry Commission first thought. 'I think they need to take two steps back and look again at how the population is managed.' The selection of cull animals on Forestry Commission-managed land by its professional wildlife ranger staff takes into account many factors before handing out death sentences. This includes the degree of nuisance, perception of levels of aggression, population dynamics and perceived population densities in any given area. Culling for 2011/12 was completed by the end of September 2011, so, except for the removal of animals for animal welfare reasons, this year’s cull has stopped. During the most recent census, using night-vision technology, only 16 boar were counted despite the Commission previously claiming there were around 350 roaming the Forest. The census, when completed early next year, will help form the Forestry Commission’s cull target for 2012. Meanwhile, environmentalists in the Dean have been calling for a closed season on hunting the boar to help them flourish. It costs the Forestry Commission £50,000 a year to cull boar in Dean.","'Beechenhurst Six' so popular they avoid previous death sentences .

Dwain Pellebon, 54, of the University of Oklahoma, was arraigned on two counts of rape, two counts of lewd acts with a child and two counts of sexual child abuse. The professor was arrested last week after authorities received allegations from a child welfare worker he had sexually abused two teenage girls in the past two years. He denies all the allegations. Paid leave: Dwain Pellebon, 54, of the University of Oklahoma, has been arrested for allegedly committing rape twice and lewd acts on a child under 16 years old . A state Department of Human Services worker told Norman police that a . 13-year-old reported seeing Pellebon fondle another 13-year-old during a . sleepover at the suspect's Norman home, according to a search warrant . affidavit. The girl was interviewed by police . last week, according to NewsOk, and told them she woke up in his home on . at least two occasions with Pellebon lying beside her touching her . 'from her hair to her ankles'. The alleged abuse started when she was 11. The social worker also said Pellebon sexually abused a mentally disabled 15-year-old at least twice. The girl also told police the suspect would remove her from bed, take her clothes off and 'display her on a bed for viewing'. Court documents also revealed the . girl said Pellebon kept track of her menstrual cycle and showed her . 'parts of the body you weren't supposed to see'. The social work professor admitted . taking off the girl's clothes but said he did it to apply cream to her . 'chest, back and butt' while they were alone in his bedroom. NewsOk reported that though Pellebon denies any sexual contact, he described himself to investigators as an 'affectionate, sensual man who liked to hug, kiss, cuddle and stroke young girls that he felt close to'. He also told police that he had viewed child pornography once but did not download it. University: Pellebon is on unpaid leave from the university and free on $75,000 bail . In 2001, Pellebon was investigated by DHS under similar circumstances . but no charges were filed because the alleged victim — the daughter of a . former Norman police officer — failed to give investigators a . statement, documents show. He has been placed on administrative leave without pay and is free on $75,000 bail. The 54-year-old was a director on a local board for Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), which helps children in juvenile court and foster systems. He took a leave of absence from the board earlier this year, a Cleveland County CASA spokesman told The Oklahoman. Pellebon . teaches a course on human sexuality that looks at ‘sexual behaviour, . gender differences and sexual values’, reported CNN.

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 1:43 PM on 20th December 2011 . Poor English: Daniel Ubani gave a lethal dose of morphine on his first shift after struggling to understand labels . Patients are still at risk despite new EU proposals on hospitals taking on staff without an adequate grasp of Englsish, the medical regulator has warned. Under the proposals overseas doctors will be able to register in the . UK without being tested on their language skills or medical competence. This . is because the EU directive says language testing can only take place . after a doctor has had their qualifications accepted by the regulator. And . even then language testing should only then take place if there are . specific concerns about an individual doctor, the rules say. The . General Medical Council said today patient safety was still at risk and . called for clarification of the detail in the directive. Parts . of the directive suggest regulators should only intervene and language . test doctors when there are 'serious and concrete doubt about the . professional’s sufficient language knowledge'. But . the GMC has called for blanket English language testing at the point of . registration, not after a doctor has already been accepted, to ensure . no one slips through the net. And . it believes it is important to test the language skills of all doctors, . not just when concerns have been raised about their performance. Under . current rules the GMC also cannot test clinical competency of doctors . coming from the EU, even though it would like to do so. However, . the regulator welcomed a clause in the directive for member states to . inform each other when a doctor has faced sanctions that affect their . registration. Niall . Dickson, chief executive of the General Medical Council said today: . 'This proposed directive covers a number of important issues that affect . the safety of patients. 'We . are pleased to see that it includes, for the first time, a requirement . for regulators across Europe to tell each other proactively when action . has been taken against a doctor’s registration. 'The proposed changes on language requirements will however raise serious concerns for patients. Tragedy: Dr Stuart Gray, whose father David Gray was killed by German doctor Daniel Ubani . 'We . will study the detail carefully but it remains our view that the final . directive should provide greater safeguards for patients. 'Over . the coming months we will continue work with the UK Government, MEPs, . other regulators, and EU institutions to ensure that the final version . of the directive focuses on protecting patients.' The GMC has been pushing for stronger language testing since the case of David Gray, who died in Cambridgeshire in 2008. He was killed by German doctor Daniel Ubani who administered 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine. Dr . Ubani admitted being exhausted after getting only a couple of hours . sleep before starting his shift in the UK, and said he was confused . about the difference between drugs used here and in Germany. His poor English meant he was refused work by the NHS in one part of the country but was later accepted in Cornwall. The GP son of Mr Gray, Stuart Gray, . said: 'If the GMC is going to be able to check the language of doctors . at registration that is a major step forward for the safety of patients. 'But what we push for next . is for them all to undergo checks on their clinical competence. My . father was killed by a doctor who was found to be clinically . incompetent.' Andrew Lansley, the Secretary of State for Health, announced new rules earlier this year to ensure hospitals language test EU doctors . In . October, the Government said it will give the GMC stronger powers to . test the language skills of doctors where there are concerns about their . ability to speak English. However, this still falls short of the GMC’s desire for blanket testing at point of registration. In . addition, the Department of Health said it would introduce new powers . so doctors can be vetted for their language skills at local level. NHS doctors are overseen by responsible officers, who make sure that they are appropriately trained and qualified for the role. In . future, these officers will have a mandatory duty to check the English . language skills of all foreign doctors before they can be employed by . the NHS in England. Today’s . directive also proposes introducing a voluntary 'professional card' - . an electronic certificate which regulatory authorities could exchange . securely over the internet. Health . Secretary Andrew Lansley said: 'For too long patients have been let . down by lax EU rules which have allowed doctors to operate in the UK . without the necessary safeguards. 'That’s . why I am bringing in new rules on checking doctors’ language skills and . new powers to take action against doctors who can’t speak English . properly. Consultation: It had been hoped there would be rigorous new tests will ensure that GPs can speak sufficient English (picture posed by models) 'The EU’s . plans for an early alert system and better sharing of information about . the doctors that come to work in the UK are steps in the right direction . but we need to understand more of the detail behind them. 'For . example, we would need to be convinced that a common European . professional card would bring tangible benefits and proper checking . systems. 'Our . overriding concern must be to protect patients from healthcare . professionals who may not be properly skilled to do the job and we will . do everything we can to work with the EU to achieve this.' Elisabetta . Zanon, director of the NHS Confederation’s European office, said: 'We . have pushed hard for some of these changes, for example the introduction . of an alert system so that countries can warn each other about . dangerous health professionals. 'These proposals mean that regulatory bodies will be allowed to check that healthcare workers can speak good English. 'However, . the details of the Commission’s proposals are still unclear and we will . need to ensure the final wording allows the NHS to introduce checks . which are fair and workable.' There are thought to be thousands of European doctors and nurses working in hospitals and surgeries who have never been given language checks. Figures show that there are some 21,000 doctors on the GMC register who gained their qualifications in EU countries. Although the Government has urged hospitals and primary care trusts to carry out their own checks on staff before employing them in the absence of a national test, many do not.","Language testing can only take place .

The luxury Christmas treat is decorated with the highest-grade platinum leaf and ambergris sugar and the pastry bound together with holy water from Lourdes. Thrilled Mukund won the pie in a raffle at the Marvellous Mince Pie Manufactory at The Exchange shopping centre in Ilford, East London. Winter wonder: The world's most expensive mince pie is dusted with ambergris sugar - excreted by whales - and covered in platinum leaf . The delicacy was created by 25-year-old luxury food designer Andrew Stellitano using vanilla beans and cinnamon from eastern spice markets. Cracking holiday: Raffle winner Mukund Soni sits down to his luxury mince pie, which has a £600 platinum coin at its centre . He then brushed it with eggnog and gilded it with platinum leaf, dusting the dessert with ambergris sugar - a bile excreted by sperm whales that sweetens over many years floating on the ocean. Mr Stellitano created his magical pie using a 17th Century recipe, Victorian moulds and modern-day technology - tracing the intricate pastry design on a computer. It took ten days for the 25-year-old, who runs food design company Astarism, to make the exclusive treat. At its centre, the lucky schoolboy will find a coin, as is traditional in festive cakes and puddings - but this one is 99 per cent pure platinum and worth £600.

'I adapted the tradition of placing coins in Christmas puddings, so for . my mince pie I decided to place a 99 per cent pure platinum coin.'

Jeremy Clarkson is being investigated over his comments about striking public sector workers. The Top Gear presenter was forced to apologise after saying all striking workers 'should be shot'. TV watchdog Ofcom has now launched an investigation after the comments - made during The One Show on November 30 - led to more than 21,000 complaints to the BBC and almost 800 to Ofcom itself. The watchdog is looking at whether he breached broadcasting rules on 'generally accepted standards'. 'Ofcom has taken the decision to investigate comments made by Jeremy Clarkson on BBC1’s The One Show,' it said. 'We will make the outcome of the investigation known in due course.' The . TV regulator is also investigating other comments Clarkson made on The . One Show describing people who kill themselves at railway stations as . causing 'immense' disruption to commuters. The . remarks about strikers led to condemnation by union leaders and . politicians. Prime Minister David Cameron branded Clarkson’s comments as . 'silly'. His gaffe came as he appeared on the BBC1 show on the evening of Britain’s biggest public sector strikes for 30 years. Speaking . about the strikers, he said: 'I’d have them all shot. I would take them . outside and execute them in front of their families. 'I mean, how dare they go on strike . when they’ve got these gilt-edged pensions that are going to be . guaranteed while the rest of us have to work for a living?' Clarkson later said in a statement that his comments were not meant to have been taken seriously. Controversial: Clarkson said he wanted to see strikers shot when he appeared on the One Show last month . Awkward: Presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones squirmed as Clarkson made his comments on the live programme . 'I didn’t for a moment intend these remarks to be taken seriously - as I believe is clear if they’re seen in context,' he said. 'If the BBC and I have caused any offence, I’m quite happy to apologise for it alongside them.' But in a later interview he appeared to be taking the matter less seriously, when he also apologised to sparrows, after saying he did not like them during The One Show. The BBC said the item 'wasn’t perfectly judged'. Earlier this year the BBC apologised about an item on BBC2’s Top Gear which led to the Mexican ambassador complaining about the 'outrageous, vulgar and inexcusable insults' made about Mexicans by Clarkson and co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond. The BBC’s editorial complaints unit upheld criticisms of the show and ruled that it reinforced stereotypes. In February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' and in November the previous year, the BBC received almost 2,000 complaints when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 4:24 PM on 20th December 2011 . ESPN college football analyst Craig James has announced he is running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican from Texas. The 50-year-old, who starred as a tailback at Southern Methodist University and with the New England Patriots in the 1980s and now appears on the cable network's weekly game broadcasts, has been flirting with entering politics for more than year. Republican fundraiser and close friend Roy Bailey last night said that Mr James has informed him he was running for the 2012 Senate seat and is in the process of dropping off his official candidate papers in Austin. Candidate: ESPN college football analyst Craig James has announced he is running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican from Texas . Mr Bailey said: 'I think it's great for Texas. Anytime you have someone with Craig's street smarts and business sense and willingness to serve the public, it's a great thing.' Mr Bailey said he will now help raise money for Mr James's political campaign. Although Mr James's name recognition could be an advantage in the race, it could also hurt him. He is a polarising figure who was embroiled in Texas Tech University's 2009 decision to fire popular football coach Mike Leach over allegations the coach mistreated Mr James's son, a Red Raiders player, after he sustained a concussion. He was also a member of the record-setting SMU football team in the early 1980s when the program entered a series of scandals that ultimately forced the NCAA to shut it down. His late entry into the Senate race puts him in a primary field already crowded with well-known and wealthy candidates who are vying for the seat vacated by retiring Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison. Lt Governor David Dewhurst, former Dallas mayor Tom Leppert and former Texas solicitor general Ted Cruz have spent months raising money and collecting endorsements from prominent Republicans. The deadline to enter the race is February 1. Mr James, who lives north of Dallas in Celina, has been a board member of the influential conservative think tank the Texas Policy Foundation in Austin and recently founded Texans for a Better America to promote conservative policies. He is likely banking on name recognition from his work for ESPN and his ties to big-time college football to overcome his late start. But that name recognition could prove to be a double-edged sword. Texas Tech fired Mr Leach, who had the most wins in school history, after Mr James complained to school administrators that he mistreated his son, Adam James, by twice ordering him to stand for hours confined in a dark place after he got a concussion. Back in the day: Mr James's name recognition could be an advantage in the race, but it could also hurt him . Mr Leach denies mistreating the younger James and has said Craig James had called coaches trying to get his son more playing time. Mr Leach also said he suspects an $800,000 bonus he was due on December 31, 2009, was the reason he was fired. Mr Leach sued the university and named Craig James as a defendant. The case is pending before the Texas Supreme Court. He has also sued ESPN and a Dallas public relations firm, accusing them of libel and slander after he was fired. From 1979 to 1982, Mr James was a star player at SMU and was part of the record-setting 'Pony Express' backfield with Eric Dickerson. Though the Mustangs won Southwest Conference championships in 1981 and 1982, the team was also embroiled in several NCAA investigations. In 1987, the NCAA hit SMU with the so-called 'death penalty' for repeated infractions, shutting down the program for a year after finding SMU had continued to pay players after promising in 1985 it would stop. SMU also chose not to play in 1988 because the NCAA would have limited the Mustangs to only seven games, none at home. The scandal is generally considered among the worst in college sports history. The sanctions levelled by the NCAA decimated the Mustangs program and SMU remains the only school to be given the 'death penalty'. Mr James was never directly implicated in the NCAA transgressions and he has consistently denied any involvement. But he also has had a close relationship with Dallas real estate developer Sherwood Blount, one of the key boosters involved in the pay-for-play scandal. Mr Blount, who reportedly insisted SMU had a 'payroll to meet' even after the school promised the payments would stop, was Mr James' agent when he played in the NFL. In his book Gameday, Mr James wrote: 'I'm not going to sit here and tell you I never received a nickel during my playing days. 'But I can say with certainty that no benefits were ever extended to me from anyone associated with the SMU administration.' After college, Mr James was drafted by the Washington Federals in the USFL and signed with the Patriots before the 1985 season. He retired from football in 1989. As a businessman, he has been involved in ventures providing video content for the Internet as well as real estate holdings and development, according to the Texans for a Better America website.","ESPN college football analyst, 50, is in process of dropping off official candidate papers in Austin ."
"By . Steve Doughty . Last updated at 9:04 AM on 20th December 2011 . Three senior judges yesterday slapped down campaigners who tried to stop library closures. The appeal judges said it was ‘fanciful’ to claim that shutting six North London libraries would disadvantage Asian communities. The decision means Brent Council can go ahead with its plan to close down the libraries in the teeth of the campaign fronted by celebrity authors and a string of pop stars. Under threat: Willesden Green Library, pictured, is one of six that could face closure . It will also influence the attitude of judges towards other local campaigns to save libraries and prevent cutbacks by councils. In recent weeks decisions by two councils to make cuts in social care spending have been overturned by High Court judges. In another case a High Court judge ruled that Gloucestershire council could not close libraries because to do so would disadvantage minority groups and break its ‘equality duties’. Earlier this month Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge expressed frustration at the enthusiasm of some of his colleagues for interfering with local council decisions, saying that ‘we have to be careful to remember that we can’t administer the responsibilities which others have.’ Brent campaigners were supported by . celebrities including children’s author Philip Pullman and playwright . Alan Bennett, and pop stars JLS, Depeche Mode, Nick Cave, the Pet Shop . Boys and Goldfrapp. Supportive: From left to right, Aston Merrygold, Marvin Humes, JB Gill and Oritsé Williams have backed the campaign . Their lawyers said that the borough had ‘failed to have due regard to the risk of indirect discrimination against Asian residents’. Nearly half the library borrowers are Asian, they said. They also said the borough was not providing an efficient library service as provided by law and had informed people of its plans too late. But Lord Justice Pill said in yesterday’s decision that Brent had acted properly in making cuts and ‘the decision to do so followed Government and local decisions properly taken, decisions which were primarily for democratically elected bodies.’ He added: ‘It is fanciful to suggest, taking the best view one can of the evidence, that it was so obvious that library provision, as distinct from other services, had discriminatory effects upon the Asian community.’ Lord Justice Pill added: Given the scale of the spending reductions the council was required to make, a decision that the library service should bear a share of the reduction was not, in my judgement, unlawful.’ Campaigners said they were thinking of taking their case to the Supreme Court. Their solicitor, John Halford, of law . firm Bindmans, said: ‘The Court of Appeal ruling is very difficult to . reconcile with what Parliament intended when it enacted the equality . duty that obliges Brent, and all other local authorities, to properly . grapple with the impact withdrawal of local services of this kind has on . communities. Authors Philip Pullman, left and Alan Bennett right are among the famous faces  supporting the SOS Brent Libraries campaign group . ‘The Court of Appeal appears to accept that there is a risk of indirect discrimination against significant numbers of people in Brent resulting from its plans to impose devastating cuts on local library services, but it has excused the council from properly taking that risk into account before deciding to make those cuts. ‘Our position is that this is simply wrong in principle. 'If the Supreme Court is willing to hear this case, we anticipate the outcome being very different.’ Margaret Bailey of campaign group SOS Brent Libraries said: ‘Our legal team presented compelling evidence of damage to communities from Brent Council’s library closures, so we are disappointed that the appeal judges have not found in our favour. ‘Closing half of our libraries has had a devastating effect on the most vulnerable members of our community, among them children and families, the elderly, the disabled and those unemployed or on low incomes. Brent has always had the means to keep these libraries open, it just lacks the will. The overwhelming strength of public feeling over the last year shows that communities need, want and will support local libraries.’","Brent council plans to shut down six libraries in North London .

Sketch: Brandon, then 14, reached breaking point after Larry made repeated, unwanted sexual advances toward him and other boys, his defence said . Sorry: Prosecutors said the shooting in front of stunned classmates was first-degree murder and that Brandon should be punished as an adult . Several jurors suggested he should not . have been tried as an adult. But he eventually reached a deal with Ventura . County prosecutors last month. 'Instead of protecting (Larry) from . himself and his poor impulse control, (the school) enabled and encouraged him to . become more and more provocative' Greg King . Brandon agreed to avoid a retrial and plead guilty to second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and use of a firearm. ‘You took upon yourself to be a bully . and to hate a smaller kid, wanting to be the big man on campus,’ Larry’s . father Greg King said. 'You have left a big hole in my heart where Larry was and it can never be filled,’ Mr King said on behalf of his wife. The case drew attention because of its . nature and raised questions about how schools deal with students and . sexual identity issues. Liberal: The shooting took place in 2008 at E.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard, California, in front of shocked students in a computer lab class . Lesbian comic Ellen DeGeneres spoke on . her talk show after the shooting and said gays should not be treated as . second-class citizens. 'He feels deeply remorseful and stated repeatedly if he could go back and take back what he did he would do it' Scott Wippert . Prosecutors said the shooting in front . of stunned classmates was first-degree murder and that Brandon should . be punished as an adult. They argued the shooting was a hate . crime, an aspect jurors rejected, after authorities found white . supremacist materials in his home. Defense lawyers wanted to keep the . case in juvenile court and said it was voluntary manslaughter because . Brandon lost control of his emotions. They said the teen was beaten by his father and was described as a bright student who lost his motivation. Anger: The shooting roiled gay rights advocates and parents in Oxnard, a city about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles, California . Larry’s father also blamed the school . district for not doing more to address the brewing feud between the two . teens and their son's behaviour. 'You took upon yourself to be a bully and to hate a smaller kid, wanting to be the big man on campus' Greg King . ‘Instead of protecting him from . himself and his poor impulse control, they enabled and encouraged him to . become more and more provocative,’ Mr King said. Larry’s family wore buttons with the . teen's face on it, while Brandon’s supporters wore powder blue . wristbands that read ‘Save Brandon.’ After serving nearly four years since . Larry’s slaying, with the additional 21 years Brandon will be released . just before his 39th birthday. Brandon was given the harshest . sentence in California law for voluntary manslaughter - 11 years - and . use of a firearm - 10 years. His murder conviction will be stayed and he is ineligible for time served or good behaviour because he pleaded guilty to murder.

Researchers at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study in Seoul used the Tachyon II supercomputer for the task, which has 157,392GB of disk space and over 26,232 processing cores – and it still needed 20 days to complete the task. In the end it analysed around 374 billion particles, which equates to an area around two thirds the size of the observable universe. Horizon Run 3: The simulation enabled researchers to peer from a virtual Earth in the middle back in time to the early universe 12 billion years ago . The purpose of the study - called Horizon Run 3 - was to run the birth and evolution of the universe to see if it ends up with the same properties as the one we see around us, including galactic clusters and super-clusters. By studying this virtual version, astronomers are better able to predict how the universe will change over time. They are also able to study in detail structures that are too old and distant to see with telescopes and matter that only exists in theory, such as acoustic baryon oscillations. These are huge clumps of frozen dark energy left over from the birth of the universe. Astronomer Dr Heather Couper believes the project is extremely worthwhile. She told MailOnline: 'This is a mind-boggling, ambitious project. It will shed light on the past and future of our universe - and give us insights into the mysterious dark matter that makes up so much of our cosmos, and the unknown dark energy that drives it.' Heavens above: The Tachyon II supercomputer took 20 days to simulate the evolution of the universe from birth to the present day . It’s thanks to supercomputers such as the Tachyonii that our understanding of the universe is growing at unprecedented rates. By comparison, a simulation of galaxies in 1970 by Jim Peebles at Princeton University analysed just 300 ‘particles’, while in 2005 the Millennium simulation looked at 10 billion particles. As MIT physics blogger KFC writes, that means that Horizon Run 3 is 8,800 times bigger.","Tachyon II supercomputer has 157,392GB of disc space .

But this brave little girl gave her parents the best Christmas present they could have hoped for when she walked for the first time since losing both of her legs after battling meningitis. Four-year-old Grace Matthews, of MIle Cross, Norwich, made her parents weep with joy as she took her first steps using her prosthetic limbs. Less than a year ago, the youngster had both of her legs removed below the knee after contracting meningitis, as well as all of her fingers, half the thumb on her left hand and half the palm on her right. Courageous: Less, than a year ago, four-year-old Grace Matthews lost both of her legs below the knee, all of her fingers, half the thumb of her left hand and half the palm of her right hand when she contracted meningitis . However, the little girl became . determined to walk again after meeting Matthew Newbury, a Norwich-born . man who became the first person in Britain to receive a new bionic leg . prosthetic system. Grace's 37-year-old mother Vicky said . : 'We are really, really proud of her. She is unbelievable. It is . amazing how she gets through everything. It is like to her there is . nothing wrong. 'She is a very inspiring, very strong . little girl. We get a lot of our strength from her. Grace had to fight . for her life after being rushed to hospital with a temperature, sickness . and a rash all over her body less than a year ago.' Vicky, who is also mother to Grace's six-year-old brother Thomas, added: 'Matthew showed Grace how he uses his legs and she asked to put her legs on. Best Christmas present they could have hoped for: Grace with her mother Vicky, father Brian and six-year-old brother Thomas . 'She took her first few steps that day outside the school while we were waiting for Thomas. 'We were talking to Brian's sister . Clare about Grace's legs when Grace said, ""let go of me"" and took three . steps on her own towards her aunt. 'It was a very emotional moment. Then she came back home and was walking around using the wall as guidance. 'It was unbelievable how quickly she went from taking three steps to walking around the house.' She added: 'I was telling Brian on the phone when she said, ""Mum come and have a look at me"", and she walked from the TV to the sofa. Inspiration: Little Grace was determined to walk again after meeting Matthew Newbury, the first Briton to receive the new bionic prosthetic leg system 'Genium' 'She had walked before but she always had someone holding her. I gasped when I saw her and had tears in my eyes.' Brian, 42, a delivery driver, said: 'Grace told me to wait near the front door and walked towards me. That feeling was overwhelming - just seeing her standing there and walking was unbelievable. It was lovely. Grace has been walking a few more steps every day with her new legs, which have been custom-made in her favourite colours of pink and purple, which will make it easier for her to get around school - Mile Cross Primary - and when playing with her pet kitten Vixi. Vicky added: 'What has happened really makes you appreciate your time with your family and your loved ones. 'We have got two big family get-togethers planned this Christmas and we are going to make sure we all have a super-duper Christmas.'","Little girl also lost her fingers, half a thumb and half a palm after illness .

Ten-year-old Sean Wingrove-Smith from Walderslade, Kent, was born with part of his right ear missing, symptomatic of a rare genetic disorder. But after numerous operations, surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital used cartilage from his . ribcage to carve an ear and he can now wear glasses for the first time. Transformation: Sean Wingrove-Smith, 10, was born with part of his right ear missing, symptomatic of a rare genetic disorder . Sean suffers from Goldenhar Syndrome, a defect which affects one in 25,000 babies causing the ears, lips or nose to stop developing properly in the womb. Although he is still deaf in one ear his parents Dee, 38, and Steve, 37, say that the cosmetic procedure has boosted his self confidence. His mother said: 'People say you should be happy the way you are. 'Sean was happy growing up, but . people had begun making jokes at his expense.' Success: Sean Wingrove-Smith after his operation to create a new ear . The complicated procedure, which was paid . for on the NHS, began last December. After hours shaping the new ear from cartilage surgeons used skin grafted from his scalp to cover it. The ear took a year to heal and the recovery process involved regular hospital trips but Sean is now able to talk to other pupils at his school about his experience. He said: 'The surgery didn't worry . me, I just hate needles. It was fun when I came into school wearing a . big white bandage and looking like a Smurf. 'The only thing I don't like about it . is most people's ears are quite flappy, but mine isn't because they've . had to make it rigid. Otherwise it's fine!' Sean is one of few patients in the country to have undergone the pioneering surgery. Goldenhar syndrome was first described by Dr. Maurice Goldenhar in 1952 but the exact cause remains unknown and usually occurs randomly.","Pupil used to be taunted by bullies because part of his ear was missing .

The number of people suffering from neurological disorders has increased, despite extra spending a report has shown. According to the National Audit Office (NAO) emergency hospital admissions for conditions such as Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis and motor neurone diseases have risen by around a third. It also revealed patient care has 'worsened' recommending that the Department of Health needs to implement more effective strategies to remedy the situation. The quality of care, coordination of health and social services, variability in access to services around the country, and poor budget control have have been cited as key areas of concern. Between 2006/07 (£2.1 billion) and . 2009/10 (£2.9 billion) there was a 38 per cent increase . in spending on neurological services with an estimated £2.4 billion spent on social services associated with such conditions. However extra money was never ring-fenced in local . health budgets and the Department of Health is unable to say how the increased spend has benefited services. Amyas Morse, head of the National . Audit Office, said: 'Services for people with long-term neurological . conditions are not as good as they ought to be, despite a large increase . in spending. 'Progress in implementing the . Department's strategy has been poor and local organisations lack . incentives to improve the quality of services. 'It is not clear how lessons will be . learnt and there are risks to services which the Department must address . to ensure that care improves.' The report revealed that patients admitted as an . emergency are often treated by doctors and nurses with no neurological . training. One study found that only 66 per cent of people . with Parkinson's disease were seen by a specialist within six weeks of . referral by their GP, despite national guidelines on the issue. Evidence suggests this can lead to poorer outcomes as many have to be referred to hospital, discharged and referred again. The report revealed that patients admitted as an emergency are often treated by doctors and nurses with no neurological training . Steve Ford, chief executive of . Parkinson's UK, said: 'Being admitted into hospital unnecessarily can . cause problems for people with Parkinson's because they often do not get . their medication on time. 'Late or missed medication can make . their symptoms unmanageable so they have to stay in hospital longer and . sometimes they may never recover.' The report also criticised the management . of a national framework for neurology introduced in 2005, saying the . Department of Health 'put in place no specific arrangements for . monitoring how commissioners implemented' it. In response to the findings, which support a previous audit from the MS Trust and Royal College of Physicians, minister of state for care services Paul Burstow reassured that new strategies are in the pipeline. 'We are determined to give people with long-term health conditions . more control over their care and support. 'That is why we are developing a new . outcomes strategy, piloting personal health budgets and rolling out . telehealth to deliver better results for people and make sound use of . NHS resources.' The NAO has called for the Department of Health and NHS commissioners to implement a future strategy . for long-term conditions focusing on better coordination of services and improved motoring to ensure budgets are being used effectively. The report did note access to services have improved along with shorter waiting times. It is estimated around two million people have a neurological condition in the UK.","Emergency hospital admissions for conditions such as Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis up by a third .

Thousands of dementia patients are suffering at the hands of undertrained hospital staff who fail to treat them as individuals and ignore their calls for help, a report has found. Patients are deprived of the simple comfort of seeing family photos or cards. On almost two out of three wards, or 59 per cent, personal items are not situated where they can reassure patients who are often frightened and confused, the first National Audit of Dementia, covering 210 hospitals in England and Wales, says. Concerns: The first National Audit of Dementia has revealed many sufferers are at risk from undertrained NHS staff (file picture) Just one in three staff said they had sufficient training in caring for those  suffering from dementia and half are not properly trained to communicate with those suffering from Alzheimer’s or deal with aggressive behaviour. The report criticised the ‘impersonal’ way in which dementia patients are treated – despite them occupying a quarter of beds. Pledge: Care services Minister Paul Burstow said hospitals will be encouraged to identify patients at risk . Staff do not always greet or talk to patients during care. They do not always explain what they are doing or offer a choice, and sometimes they do not respond to requests for help, the report added. Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘This shocking report proves once again that we urgently need a radical shake-up of hospital care. Given that people with dementia occupy a quarter of hospital beds and that many leave in worse health than when they were admitted, it is unacceptable that training in dementia care is not the norm.’ Care services minister Paul Burstow said: ‘We set this audit up to put dementia care in hospital under the spotlight. ‘It has found some excellent practice, but it has revealed far too many hospitals failing to put in place dementia-friendly care. ‘That is why we are putting in place a new financial incentive for hospitals that identify patients at risk, so they get the specialised care they need.’ Professor Peter Crome, chairman of the national audit of dementia steering group revealed that only six per cent of hospitals had a care pathway for . people with dementia - that is a written down plan of how patients, once . they have been admitted to hospital with dementia, will be cared for . and managed. He said that universal measures need to be implemented to remedy the problem and prevent lapses in care. He told  the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'Around a whole range of issues to do with people's functions, their mental state, the policies were in place but the practice was not undertaken.' 'Hospitals need to gear up their services on the assumption that the next patient who comes through the front door may have dementia - they often may not be diagnosed but they may have that condition - and they have to adapt the services, procedures, policies to manage such patients appropriately with compassion for their dignity.' It is estimated around two million people have a neurological condition in the UK.","Just one in three staff said they had sufficient training .

The huts at Bletchley Park were where British mathematicians worked in secret to crack Germany's Enigma code, using desks, blackboards, and feeding their results through primitive mechanical computers that are the grandfathers of the machines we use today. Many historians say that the efforts of the Bletchley Park codebreakers shortened the war by up to two years - ending the loss of Allied lives. But one hut currently stands derelict and others are in need of restoration. The Bletchley Park Trust today received a donation of £550,000 from search giant Google - helping to tip the site towards the £4.6 million 'match' fund it needs to receive National Lottery funding. Working in utmost secrecy, codebreakers at Bletchley Park cracked Germany's 'unbreakable' Enigma code - and being able to 'listen in' on Nazi communications helped to shorted World War II . The World War II Enigma decoding machine at Bletchley Park: The Nissen huts were filled with young workers intercepting and decoding German transmissions . Peter Barron, Director of External . Relations for Google, said, 'The Bletchley Park Trust has been doing . great work to honour Alan Turing and the codebreakers who helped shorten World War II and to educate the next generation about the . history of modern computing.' Manchester don Turing devised an 'electromechanical' machine that could break the code used by the German Navy. He is widely seen as the father of modern computing - but was persecuted for his homosexuality, and committed suicide in 1954 by eating a cyanide-laced apple. 'The huts were very basic, filled with desks, blackboards - and felt university-like,' says Sinclair McKay, author of The Secret Life of Bletchley Park. 'The huts were where all the amazing flashing moments of insight happened, though - often with no machinery whatsoever.' Huts at Bletchley Park were where many of the moments of inspiration occurred that led to Britain cracking the German Enigma code - but today one of the main huts stands derelict and two are in need of restoration . Alan Turing is widely seen as the father of modern computing - but was persecuted for his homosexuality, and committed suicide in 1954 by eating a cyanide-laced apple . Those huts were terribly cold in winter - most people wore mittens. They had sqeaky lino, and dozens of people worked side by side on desks. Messages were passed between huts down a tunnel on a tray pushed along with a broom handle. 'It was run by MI6 - but actually the people working inside those huts were civilians,' says McKay. 'Many were mathematicians drawn from universities. They would get their summons, but instead of reporting for the front line, they would report for duty at Bletchley Park. 'Bletchley Park was the dawn of computer age,' says McKay, 'For young people especially, it's an amazing insight into how the Nazis were outwitted and how computing began- in rooms filled with desks, and paper and blackboards, without a machine in sight. That's why this restoration is crucial.' The Abwehr Enigma decoding machine at Bletchley Park: The electromechanical methods of 'cryptanalysis' developed by the team at Bletchley Park led to the computer age . Jean Valentine operated one of Alan Turing's Bombe machines used to crack the German Enigma code - the machines broke 3,000 enemy messages a day and are said to have shortened the war by two years . 'Google’s backing draws the Bletchley Park Trust nearer to its goal of developing the site, both to educate and inspire generations to come and as a permanent testament to the brilliant people who worked there,' said the Trust this week. 'Once the remaining funding is in place the Trust will get underway with the restoration of iconic codebreaking huts 1, 3 and 6 and create a world-class visitor centre and exhibition in the currently derelict Block C.' Simon Greenish, CEO of the Bletchley Park Trust, said, 'We are tremendously grateful to Google for bringing us considerably closer to achieving our development aims. 'It would be wonderful if other donors follow Google’s example to help preserve our computing heritage.  We could then proceed as soon as possible with restoration of the profoundly historically significant codebreaking huts.'","Site cracked 3,000 German messages a day .

World of Warcraft is the most popular 'online world' ever created - playing host to 10 million gamers who battle its dragons, demons and dungeons, or just fight and trade with each other. It's also a money machine that generates a reported $500 million a year in subscriptions and disc sales - making its owner Activision the biggest games company on Earth. But tomorrow, gaming giant Electronic Arts unveils one of the most expensive games ever made - Star Wars: the Old Republic. The game aims to outpace Warcraft's swords and sorcery with interstellar travel, lightsabers and the world of Yoda, Darth Vader and the galactic Empire. If it succeeds, it could push EA ahead of its bitter rival Activision. Players can opt to play as lightsaber-wielding Jedi or evil Sith - you can't play as famous characters such as Darth Vader, but a few famous faces crop up throughout the game . 'Massively multiplayer' games such as Star Wars: the Old Republic allow tens of thousands of players to adventure together - battling monsters together or battling one another to become more powerful . Many games have attempted the feat - including several with well-known characters such as Conan the Barbarian - but . the Old Republic is hotly tipped to do it, thanks to the familiar Star . Wars universe, a rumoured £100-million-plus budget, and the fact that . Warcraft subscribers seem to be tiring of the game's fantasy world, with . two million leaving in the past year. The game officially launches tomorrow. Early buyers have been able to access the game since December 13, but tomorrow sees the floodgates open. For gamers, it's easily the biggest launch in a genre that's been ruled single-handedly by Warcraft for more than five years. 'It's happening. It's finally happening,' said game site IGN this week. The game's maker, Electronic Arts, was once the biggest game publisher in the world, but lost ground to rival Activision when Activision acquired Blizzard, makers of World of Warcraft in 2008. The early signs are all good - no reviews are published yet, as EA has been keen to manage publicity, but 1.6 million users played an early 'test' version of the game . Unlike Warcraft, Old Republic uses recorded voice dialogue, rather than text - it has a more voice acting than any previous game, online or off . The game has seen the previous Star Wars online 'world' - Star Wars: Galaxies - switched off yesterday, with an announcement that the Rebel Alliance had 'won'. But while previews and gamer reaction to the game is generally good, others are less sure about the business model. The game has been astronomically expensive for Electronic Arts, and faces competition from other, free, online games. The evil Galactic Emperor holds court in the highly anticipated PC title Star Wars: the Old Republic. Gamers will play 'together' in an online world based on Star Wars . Frank Gibeau, President of Electronic Arts, said to Gamesindustry.biz, 'I wish it wasn't so expensive. I think everybody does.' The business model where gamers pay for discs, then pay to subscribe, is also under threat. Many games, such as Sony's DC Universe Online, have switched to a 'free to play' system similar to Facebook games, where the game itself is free, but users pay to upgrade their character with powerful items or new outfits. Gaming site Eurogamer described the game as 'the end of an era' - saying that it's arrived as the world of online gaming changes forever. The game lets players battle monsters - or one another, with the players split into two factions. The resulting mix ensures that both pacifists and more warlike players are catered for . School for scoundrels: the Sith Academy, where players can be trained in using the powers of the Dark Side. You can also join the Jedi - or simply become a trader . The Old Republic does have new ideas, though such as voice acting throughout the game - giving Old Republic a more story-driven feel. It's also driven the price up hugely. World of Warcraft has had up to . 12 million monthly subscribers, earning the company a reported $500 . million a year in subscription fees - on top of disc prices for the game . and its four expansions. The game has been running since 2004. Gamers will team up together to take on hideous alien beasts in a huge 'online world' shared by millions . The game includes hundreds of planets to explore - gamers can captain spaceships, command crews, make millions, and even turn to the Dark Side . The game also has voice acting throughout - . and a greater focus on story than rival Warcraft, which gamers sometimes . complain has 'hamster wheel'-like qualities, as they're forced to . repeat tasks to earn in-game rewards. The world of Old Republic is far bigger than the world of the films - but gamers should expect to meet familiar faces .","Star Wars: the Old Republic is most expensive game ever by Electronic Arts .

And there's pretty much no chance of a White Christmas on the East Coast. Holiday travellers - well, most of them - today breathed a sigh of relief after a storm that dumped 15 inches of snow and forced the closure of interstates across the Great Plains moved out of the region. It allowed crews to clear drifts and stranded motorists to leave roadside hotels - but after causing at least two fatal car accidents and a plane crash that killed 11 people in total across the U.S. Meanwhile hopes were dashed of a White Christmas in New York, Washington D.C. and Boston - as forecasters predict rain is more likely. But there's still a good chance of snow in the inner northeast. White Christmas? You're most likely to get snow on Christmas Day if you live in one of the white shaded areas - and it's still possible if you're in one of the greyer areas . Lonely: A truck travels along Highway 40 as snow covers the highway and the surrounding plains, west of Hays, Kansas, on Tuesday . Way to go: Snow sticks to road signs along I-70 near Paxico, Kansas, on Tuesday. A deadly storm that halted travel throughout the Great Plains began to weaken on Tuesday . Stuck in: Debbie Weber digs out her driveway in Hays, Kansas, on Tuesday after a winter storm dumped more than 8 inches of snow on the area . The storm crawled from New Mexico and Colorado through Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. The fierce winds and heavy snowfall closed several major roads then weakened on Tuesday towards Missouri. But another storm threatened some of those areas hit earlier in the week, including the Rockies and parts of Wyoming, New Mexico and western Kansas. Those areas could see another round of snow and wind over the next few days – potentially bringing a white Christmas - but it won't be as heavy as the recent storm, the National Weather Service said. ‘It's tough to match what we had in some areas with this past storm,’ meteorologist Brian Barjenbruch of the National Weather Service in Topeka, Kansas, said early on Wednesday. Meanwhile, authorities still reported snow drifts of up to 10ft in southeast Colorado, and Texas officials warned drivers to stay off the road in the Panhandle so crews could remove ice and snow. Some highways in the western half of the Oklahoma Panhandle remained closed early on Wednesday, with transportation officials warning of hazardous conditions.

Not happy: A group of Angus cattle try to escape the weather as they hide behind a group of buildings in a corral near Ellis, Kansas, on Tuesday . Limited visibility: Traffic makes its way down Highway 64 as snow and sleet falls on Monday in Guymon, Oklahoma. The wintry weather was preceded by more than a half-inch of rain and a blizzard warning is in effect . At least 40 people were stranded at the Longhorn Motel in Boise City, Oklahoma, where manager Pedro Segovia said blowing snow had created drifts 2ft and 3ft high and closed the main road. ‘Some people cannot even get out of their houses. There is too much snow,’ Mr Segovia said on  Tuesday. ‘It was blowing. We've got big piles. It's real bad.’ 'Some people cannot even get out of their houses. There is too much snow. It was blowing. We've got big piles. It's real bad' Pedro Segovia . Receptionist MaKenzee Grove sympathised with the 50 or so people stranded at the hotel where she works in Guymon, about 60 miles east of Boise City. ‘I have this rinky-dink car that does not do well in this,’ she said. ‘If we wouldn't have had the wind, it wouldn't have been as bad. The winds... made the drifts really bad.’ A few guests traveling to Oklahoma City managed to leave on Tuesday, but others were staying another night until all the roads were clear, Ms Grove said. Officials reopened Interstate 40 in the Texas Panhandle and New Mexico, and portions of Interstate 70 in western Kansas that had been closed on Tuesday. Stuck: Longmont police respond to three separate weather-related accidents as snow falls on Colorado Highway 66 in Longmont, Colorado, on Monday.

Crawling: Inbound traffic on I-25 approaches Santa Fe, New Mexico, in a single file as snow accumulates on the road on Monday as a winter storm hit the area . New Mexico reopened a closed section of Interstate 25, the main route from Santa Fe to the Colorado line, after crews cleared drifts as high as 5ft. 'I have this rinky-dink car that does not do well in this. If we wouldn't have had the wind, it wouldn't have been as bad. The winds... made the drifts really bad' MaKenzee Grove . In Kansas, schools in Manhattan . cancelled classes on Tuesday, anticipating several inches of snow. But . the National Weather Service reported later that 3 inches or less fell. A cold rain pelted the Topeka area, turned into a mix of light sleet and snow without much settling and tapered off. The storm became less potent as it moved northeast toward the Great Lakes. Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Ben Gardner said the patrol dealt with dozens of accidents in which motorists slid off highways. ‘We had ice-covered roads, covered by snow packed on top,’ he said. The big chill: The snow blowers were out clearing sidewalks in Santa Fe as dusk began to fall on Monday . Picture postcard: Snow covered trees make for a scenic view of the east entrance to the Santa Fe New Mexico state capitol as residents deal with the winter storm that hit on Monday . Wreckage: The crash site of a single-engine plane is seen on Monday in Brazos County, Texas. The crash killed five people, including two children. The flight originated in Atlanta and was headed for Waco, Texas . The late-autumn snowstorm lumbered into the region on Monday, turning roads to ice and reducing visibility to zero. Many of the areas hit had enjoyed a relatively balmy 60F just 24 hours earlier. New York, Boston and Washington D.C. are all very unlikely to experience a White Christmas. But a storm starting in British Columbia could bring snow to the northeast and New England. Most others people outside of northern central parts of the U.S. won't have snow at Christmas. The storm was blamed for at least eleven deaths. Four people were killed when their vehicle collided with a pickup truck in eastern New Mexico on Monday where blizzard-like conditions are rare. A prison guard and inmate died when a jail van crashed along an icy Colorado roadway. The other five deaths came in central Texas after a light aircraft crash was blamed on the conditions. Victims were Michael Butler, 33; his wife Kelly, 34; daughter Brooke, 14; and son Braden, 2. The pilot's brother, David Butler, 37, was also killed.","Snowstorm had caused interstate closures across Great Plains this week .

Russia has urged Nato to investigate civilian deaths in Libya from its bombing campaign, saying their claim there were not any non-military casualties is untrue. Russia's United Nations ambassador Vitaly Churkin said he had been asking Nato to give 'a definitive report' to the UN Security Council summing up its activities in Libya. But he said 'unfortunately' the alliance only provided 'piecemeal, rather perfunctory reports... (that) were not very informative'. Bombing: Nato has been urged by Russia to investigate civilian deaths in Libya from its bombing campaign . Russia holds the council presidency this . month and Mr Churkin said he would raise the issue of civilian . casualties when it discussed Libya on Thursday. Mark Kornblau, spokesman for the US Mission to the United Nations, said the Nato campaign was intended to protect Libyan civilians. 'The Nato mission in Libya was responsible for saving tens of thousands of innocent civilians from imminent slaughter by a madman,' he said. Nato's seven-month air campaign against Libya was hailed as a triumph by the alliance for setting the country on the path to a democratic transition after the ousting and killing of dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Request: Russia's United Nations ambassador Vitaly Churkin said he had been asking Nato to give 'a definitive report' to the UN Security Council . But the operation's critics - including Russia, China and the African Union - have argued that Nato misused the limited UN resolution imposing a no-fly zone and authorising the protection of civilians as a reason to promote regime change. 'Unfortunately, Nato adopted the pure propaganda style, claiming zero civilian casualties in Libya which was completely implausible first of all and secondly not true,' Mr Churkin said. Success: Nato's Libya campaign was hailed as a triumph for assisting the country to oust Gaddafi . He said it was 'cruel and cynical' for people whose houses were destroyed and are now suffering from suspicion by their neighbours for Gaddafi support 'to be told that actually nothing of this kind happened.' He said he was sure the United Nations could provide help in thoroughly investigating civilian casualties from Nato aerial bombing if the alliance ""is reluctant to do it on their own.' Mr Churkin also criticised UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon for supporting Nato's claim of zero casualties, but he praised him for also saying 'there must be no misunderstanding about civilian casualties in Libya.' During Nato's campaign, which ended on October 31, its warplanes flew 26,000 armed attacks, including more than 9,600 strike missions, destroying more than 1,000 tanks, vehicles, and guns. The victory in Libya represented a major boost for the Cold War alliance which is bogged down in a 10-year war in Afghanistan, a 12-year mission in Kosovo, and anti-piracy operation off the Somali coastline.","Moscow's UN Ambassador says no-fly zone was misused .

"By . Anthony Bond . Last updated at 9:03 AM on 20th December 2011 . Spending spree: Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has announced today that he is investing $300 million into social networking site Twitter . He is the billionaire Saudi prince who already boasts a business portfolio that includes shares in Apple, AOL, News Corp and Fox News. Now Alwaleed bin Talal has announced he will be widening his media influence by investing $300 million into Twitter. His joint investment with his Kingdom Holding Company (KHC) follows months of negotiations which they say will give them a 'strategic stake' in the micro-blogging site. It is not yet clear how much of the company the prince will control. His investment comes as Arab . activists from Tunisia to Bahrain have flocked to Twitter during the past year to coordinate . protests and voice their opposition to long-ruling autocratic regimes. The five-year-old site has been . instrumental in connecting protesters and relaying on-the-ground . developments during the Arab Spring uprisings. But a Saudi law which came into force in February has given the state further powers to fine or block online news and commentary websites if they are deemed to be offensive, compromising the nation’s economy or security, or violating Islamic sharia law. Two years ago, lawyer Waleed Abulkhair and businessman Khaled al Nasser said their Twitter accounts had been blocked because of their comments on human rights in the kingdom. Some activists have eve been detained. Prince Alwaleed, a nephew of the Saudi king, ranks 26th on Forbes' list of the world's richest people. He has a history of investing in media and technology companies, and said the deal represents an interest 'in promising, high-growth businesses with a global impact.' Regal company: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal (right) with his wife Princess Amira and Prince Charles at the reopening of the newly refurbished Savoy Hotel, which the Saudi billionaire owns . 'We believe that social media will . fundamentally change the media industry landscape in the coming years,' Ahmed Halawani, KHC's executive director of private equity and . international investments, said in a statement. 'Twitter will capture and monetize this positive trend.' Twitter spokesman Matt Graves confirmed the investment but was unable to provide further details. Prince Alwaleed owns 95 per cent of KHC, which has a major stakes in Citigroup, Apple, and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Well connected: Prince Alwaleed leaves Westminster Abbey after attending the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in April . Arabic . is now the fastest growing language on Twitter, according to a study . released last month by French social media research firm Semiocast. Although . Arabic tweets account for just over 1 per cent of all Twitter messages, . their volume has jumped 22 times over the past year, Semiocast said. 'Twitter . is growing exponentially, especially in the context of the Middle . East,' said Ismail Patel, who follows digital media in the region for . the research firm Informa Telecoms & Media. 'The Middle East is an important region . for Twitter. And Twitter is becoming increasingly important for all . Middle East residents ... because of the Arab Spring protests. Prince Alwaleed is launching a new . Arabic news channel that will challenge established players such as . Qatar's Al-Jazeera and Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya. The . channel, which will be called Alarab, is expected to begin operations . next year and will feature reports from business news service Bloomberg . LP. Prince Alwaleed . has said he hopes the new network will focus on the shifts taking place . across the Arab world, with an emphasis on increased freedom of speech . and of the press. KHC . also owns a sizable stake in a Saudi media company that produces the . influential Arabic language newspaper Asharq al-Awsat and other . publications. Powerful tool: A protester calls for an end to military rule in Egypt during clashes with riot police in Cairo yesterday. Activists across the Arab world have used Twitter to co-ordinate protests . Popular: Arab activists from Tunisia to Bahrain have flocked to Twitter during the past year to coordinate protests and voice their opposition to long-ruling autocratic regimes . Prince Alwaleed's decision to buy into Twitter likely goes beyond his interest in media and technology. Said . Hirsh, a Mideast economist with Capital Economics in London, said rich . Arab investors like Prince Alwaleed have long targeted trophy assets and . well established businesses. 'It . is an investment into a well recognized brand with future growth . potential,' Mr Hirsh said, adding that Twitter investors such as . Alwaleed are unlikely to try to influence the user-generated content on . the site. In charge: Dick Costolo, the chief executive officer of Twitter . 'I don't think that there is anything sinister behind it,' he said. Twitter recently began rolling out a series of tweaks designed to make the site easier to navigate. The redesign also aims to allow for more detailed information about corporate brands, as Twitter tries to convert more companies into advertisers. The company earlier this year raised $400 million from venture capitalists and other investors. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo said in September that cash cushion would allow the company to control its own destiny - and for now avoid selling its stock through an initial public offering. By limiting its shareholders to a small group of private investors, Twitter doesn't have to disclose how much revenue it brings in. The research firm eMarketer estimates Twitter will generate close to $140 million in ad revenue this year and $260 million in 2012. Globally, the San Francisco-based . company has more than 100 million active users who post an average of . 250 million messages, or 'tweets,' a day. Twitter allows users to send short messages of up to 140 characters.","Billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal gets 'strategic stake' in micro-blogging site .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 12:13 PM on 20th December 2011 . Prisons were not ready for the sudden influx of inmates that occurred following the summer riots, a report by inspectors has found. With 60 inmates arriving in the space of a week, Feltham Young Offenders' Institute in West London struggled to cope with the demand and fights regularly broke out with those already being held there concerned that rioters had 'destroyed their turf'. Many of those involved in the disturbances had also been abandoned by their families who had even considered moving home, shamed by their actions and affected by their communities' reactions. The number of young offenders put on . suicide watch increased by 200 per cent while many experienced gangs and . violence for the first time. Feltham Young Offenders' Institute struggled to cope after the riots as 60 prisoners arrived in a week - the normal number that is jailed there in a month . Inmates baulked at scenes played out on television inside the prisons by lashing out at those they saw as being responsible for putting their families at risk. Staff at the jail found that there was 'no central strategy to manage the unprecedented numbers of new arrivals and transfers, including those they were expecting as further arrests were made'. In one instance there was a 'copycat riot' in the young adults' gym at Feltham but a repeat in the unit holding those under 18 'did not materialise'. The report by prison inspectors said: 'Young people already in the prison . had negative perceptions of those involved in the riots as they felt . that they were responsible for the transfer of their friends to other . prisons. 'They had seen their home areas attacked on television and were worried about family and friends there.' Footage of the destruction sparked anger among inmates who then vented their frustration on those they saw responsible for causing the damage . Many young offenders were ostracised by their families after seeing the reaction of their communities and some have even said they want to move because of the fallout . Existing prisoners were moved to . prevent disturbances, but 'there had been attacks on those involved in . the riots and this was now the primary cause of fights', the inspectors . said. 'Young people on different units had . formed themselves into gangs and there had been fights between units. 'This included those who had not been involved in gangs in the community . before and who had become part of the unit gang to protect themselves. 'Young people who had not previously . experienced violence were witnessing it first hand in custody and some . had become more vulnerable as a result. 'Although there had been no actual . self-harming, the number of open ACCTs (assessment, care in custody and . teamwork assessments) had increased by 200 per cent due to staff . concerns for new young people.' As those involved in the riots were . dealt with swiftly by the courts, the number of new arrivals at Feltham . hit 60 in a week, the same number it would typically expect in a whole . month, the inspectors said. With . increasing pressure on space, 70 people had to be moved out of the . institution within a week with as few as two hours notice. Most . of them were transferred 200 miles away to Hindley YOI in Wigan and . many did not have time to let their families know about the move. Staff . also had little information about new arrivals and the 'huge increase . of movement across the whole of the under-18 estate' affected both . newcomers and the settled population. Chief . inspector Nick Hardwick said that while Feltham 'coped well' overall, . it was important for all institutions to 'work effectively with young . people held in custody for the first time to ensure they do not become . caught in a gang and criminal culture'. The . Howard League for Penal Reform also received reports that children in . prisons had been 'advised to walk around in pairs so they were not on . the landing on their own'. Frances . Crook, the group's chief executive, said: 'Other prisoners said that . the rioters had 'destroyed their turf' and beatings had been going on . all day. Similar to emergency services tackling the disturbances and fires, prison staff were forced to 'make it up as they went along' in the struggle to cope with the pressure . 'One of our lawyers said it was difficult to hear on the telephone as screaming and shouting could be heard in the background.' She added: 'The Government made it clear that those involved in the riots should expect to go to jail. 'Obeying . political pressure to respond quickly and punitively, the courts . over-reacted to the civil disturbances of the summer and sent hundreds . of children to prison, putting them at risk, blighting their life . chances, and stretching the prison system to its limit. Chief prisons inspector Nick Hardwick said that Feltham 'coped well' but other institutions should work to prevent young people becoming caught in gang culture . 'It is shocking that there was no coherent strategy from central Government for dealing with the massive influx of children sent into custody. Staff were forced to make it up as they went along.' Penelope Gibbs, director of the Prison Reform Trust's Out of Trouble programme, said: 'Feltham Juvenile YOI was inundated with new arrivals as a result of the riots and this report details the strain on the system. 'The system did cope, just about, but the report begs the question as to whether so many under 18-year-olds needed to be locked up on remand in the wake of the riots.' A Prison Service spokesman said: 'We have a zero-tolerance policy towards violence in prisons. 'Those suspected or convicted of rioting received the same treatment as all other prisoners, and any incidents which have taken place have been minor. 'Any incidents should be seen in the context of the age and challenging nature of the population at Feltham.' Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, added that inspectors found that Feltham was 'fundamentally safe, with good self-harm and violence management, positive staff-prisoner relationships, effective drug interventions and good healthcare and resettlement provision'. 'Feltham has a very challenging population and I am pleased that the work being undertaken to address gang issues has been recognised,' he said. 'At the time of the inspection Feltham was adapting to cope with a higher sentenced population of young people than previously. The Governor will use the chief inspector's report to develop the regime to match the young people's needs and improve activity provision.'","Inspectors noted a sharp rise in young offenders put on suicide watch following disturbances .

A Libyan rebel leader handed over by . MI6 for torture by Colonel Gaddafi’s henchmen yesterday launched legal . action against Britain. Abdel Hakim Belhadj – who this year . helped Nato oust the tyrant by leading the military assault on Tripoli – . could win £1million compensation from UK taxpayers. He claims Britain helped snatch him . on behalf of Gaddafi’s regime in 2004, a few days before Tony Blair . embraced Gaddafi in the notorious ‘Deal in the Desert’. He says he suffered six years of . abuse in the despot’s brutal prisons, and during this time was . interrogated by British spies including a female MI6 agent. Mr Belhadj, who was released from . custody in 2010, is now a key figure in the new Libya and many expect . him to run for president. His wife, Fatima Boucher, who was . pregnant when she was seized with him, is also suing the UK. She was . held for four months so could be in line for hundreds of thousands in . compensation. Lawyers acting for the couple served . legal papers on the Treasury Solicitor yesterday, and insisted Mr . Belhadj was only suing the Government because ministers had ignored his . requests for a full apology over his ‘barbaric’ treatment. Mr Belhadj, 45, claims he was . injected with truth drugs and left hanging by his wrists in a Tripoli . cell as his interrogators beat him and demanded to know the whereabouts . of Osama Bin Laden. Whitehall sources have claimed a . Cabinet minister would almost certainly have had to approve MI6 agents . turning him over to Gaddafi, although the Foreign Secretary at the time, . Jack Straw, has denied any knowledge of it. Letter apparently implicating the Government: The note congratulates Libya on the arrival of Abu 'Abd Allah Sadiq - the other name Abdel Hakim Belhadj went by. The authenticity has not been confirmed . Mr Belhadj fled Libya as a dissident . in the 1990s. He ended up Malaysia where he sought asylum through the . British High Commission. But MI6 agents tipped off the CIA, . and Mr Belhadj and his wife were taken into custody as they changed . planes in Bangkok, it is alleged. U.S. officials then flew him to Libya, it is claimed. Sapna Malik, the couple’s lawyer, . said: ‘The barbaric treatment which our clients describe, both at the . hands of the Americans and the Libyans, is beyond comprehension and yet . it appears that the UK was responsible for setting off this torturous . chain of events.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘The .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:57 PM on 21st December 2011 . Research In Motion has turned down takeover overtures from Amazon and other potential buyers because the BlackBerry maker prefers to fix its problems on its own, according to sources. Amazon hired an investment bank this summer to review a potential merger with RIM, but it did not make a formal offer, said one of the sources. It is not clear whether informal discussions between Amazon and RIM ever led to specific price talk, or who else had approached RIM about a takeover. Talks: Amazon considered buying RIM, but made no formal offer, say industry insiders . RIM's board wants co-chief executives Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie to focus on trying to turn around the business through the launch of new phones, better use of assets such as BlackBerry Messaging and restructuring, two sources said. They did not want to be identified as the discussions are private. RIM and Amazon declined to comment. At the moment Blackberry is trying to make sure that delays to its new touchscreen phones don’t harm the business. Trouble ahead? Blackberry's new phone (not shown) has been delayed until late 2012, which analysts say could damage profits . The new devices are designed to update the smartphone brand for consumers used to iPhones and other touch handsets such as Android, but have been delayed until the end of next year. It's a delay that some analysts predict could be disastrous for the company. The touchscreen BB10 phones were crucial to updating the brand. The co-CEOs insisted that BlackBerry can hold out - but admitted that BlackBerry sales were falling month by month, and that net income had fallen 71 per cent. Earlier this year, BlackBerry also ran into trademark difficulties for the new operating system - BBX - and renamed the phones BB10 to avoid a dispute. No official name or spec for any of the handsets has yet been revealed. Shots of an angular handset supposedly known as BlackBerry London leaked earlier this month. The phones will run an operating system that's mid-way between the simple, old-style operating system of current BlackBerries, and the more iPad-esque OS of the recent BlackBerry PlayBook. PlayBook was another disaster for the company, with the seven-inch tablet sold at a damaging loss after customers failed to take an interest. PlayBook required a BlackBerry phone 'tethered' to it for email to work - unlike any other tablet on the market. Peter Misek, an analyst at Jefferies & Co in New York, said the company needs to get its new phones out fast. Mike Lazaridis, one of the company's co-CEOs, said the BlackBerry 10 phones will need a new chipset that will not be available until mid-2012, so the company expects the new phones to ship late in the year. 'We've experienced a delay,' he said. Analysts say RIM's future depends on the new software.","Blackberry's income has fallen 71 per cent .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:40 AM on 21st December 2011 . An 11-year-old boy's survival from a near-fatal battle with a flesh-eating bacteria has been declared a miracle by the Vatican. Jake Finkbonner, of Ferndale, Washington, made a stunning recovery from a tissue-destroying disease that gnawed away at his young face and nearly took his life in 2006. Pope Benedict XVI attributed the miracle attribute to The Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha, clearing the way for the 17th century Mohawk-Algonquin woman to become the first American-Indian saint. Family: Jake Finkbonner, pictured with his father Don, mother Elsa, and his two sisters, smiles after his incredible ordeal . Jake was only five when he cut his lip during the last minute of a Boys & Girls Club basketball game on February 11, 2006. Recalling the incident on his website, he describes how he was running down court with the ball when he stopped in front of the hoop to shoot and was pushed from behind. 'I flew forward and hit my mouth on the base of the portable basketball hoop,' he writes. And there, on the surface of the hoop, was Strep A bacteria, which causes a deadly disease known as necrotizing fasciitis, otherwise known as a flesh-eating bacteria that that most patients have a 50-50 chance of surviving. Happy and healthy: Jake pictured in his 2005 kindergarten photo before he contracted the flesh-eating bacteria . The next day, Jake was fighting for his . life. Admitted to Children's Hospital in Seattle, he was diagnosed with a . severe infection that began spreading across his face, head and chest. 'We do not discredit the doctors who helped our son. We know that without them, our son would not have survived.' MSNBC.com reports with Jake's prognosis grim, the family’s priest, Fr Tim Sauer, was called in to administer what he thought would be last rites. But at his urging, Jake's parents, . Elsa and Don Finkbonner, began praying to Tekakwitha, who converted to . Christianity when she was 18 despite facing persecution for joining the . faith. Her face was scarred by smallpox as a . child, but legend has it that just minutes after she died in 1680, aged . just 24, she shone brightly and all the marks from smallpox vanished . from her face, revealing her true beauty. Family, friends and neighbours joined them in praying for Tekakwitha to intercede. Fast-moving: Jake is pictured just one day after the accident (left) and on his sixth birthday (right), eight days after his exposure to the bacteria . Medical miracle: Two months later, Jake is in hospital, with skin grafts that came from his scalp (left). Right, Jake is pictured with silicone implants used to stretch and create new skin to cover his scarring . Ready for home: Jake is pictured with his parents, Elsa and Don Finkbonner, and his two sisters right before discharge on Good Friday, April 2006 . Then, on Jake's ninth day in hospital, he took a sudden turn for the better. Sauer told the website a relic of . Tekakwitha was brought to his bedside, placed on a pillow next to his . head. His health continued to improve. About eight weeks later, Jake was . cleared to go home. Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare infection of the deeper layers of skin. It can be caused by many types of bacteria, which usually enter via an open wound, for example following surgery. Despite being known as a ‘flesh-eating’ bug, the bacteria do not actually eat the tissue. They cause the destruction of skin and muscle by releasing toxins. Symptoms usually begin with patients complaining of intense pain in the area where the infection began. In the early stages, signs of inflammation may not appear. Redness and swollen or hot skin will show up quicker if the bacteria is closer to the surface of the skin. As the disease progresses, skin colour may change to violet and blisters may form, with tissue then turning black as it dies. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis typically have a fever and appear very ill. Diarrhoea and vomiting are also common symptoms. Mortality rates have been noted as high as 73 per cent if left untreated. Once the disease is diagnosed it is almost always necessary to cut away the infected tissue to stop it from spreading. Sauer said he then sent a letter to . the Seattle archbishop detailing the possible miracle. The Vatican sent . investigators to Ferndale and Seattle, where they interviewed hospital . doctors and followed-up on the claims. The Congregation for Causes of Saints, a committee of cardinals and bishops in Rome, reviewed the case and presented it to the pope, who on Monday signed a decree authenticating the miracle attribute to The Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha. She could be canonised as early as February, becoming America's first indigenous saint. Mrs Finkbonner told MSNBC her son, meanwhile, is 'doing fantastic' and is playing basketball again. 'He’s an excellent student, a typical, . happy 11-year-old-boy who plays video games and punches his sister in . the head and makes her cry,' she said. The mother told MailOnline it was 'unexplainable' how Jake survived his illness. And while she said even doctors are . baffled as to Jake's recovery, the family does not discredit the . intervention of medical technology they say was essential to his . survival. In an email to MailOnline, Mrs . Finkbonner wrote: 'We do not discredit the doctors who helped our son. We know that without them, our son would not have survived. 'This . investigation took place by an panel of priests, doctors and lawyers . from the Catholic church.  They interviewed us along with the doctors . who treated Jake,' she added. 'These are the same doctors who have . stated that they could not explain why Jake lived. They did everything . humanly possible for him and can not explain why he survived.' In fact, the experience has even made Jake consider becoming a doctor himself. Inspiration: Jake and his sisters smile with Katie Stamm, Miss America 2009 . Recovering: Jake smiles from the cockpit of an airplane that brought his family home from Georgia to Seattle in March, 2009 . '[It] Makes me feel like I’m doing something for God, bringing more people back into his community,' he told KOMO. Kateri Tekakwitha, also known as . Caterina Tekakwitha, was born in 1656 in nearby Auriesville but her . parents - one of whom was a Mohawk Chief named Kenneronkwa - and brother . died of smallpox when she was aged only four. She survived but was given the . unfortunate surname because of her poor vision - as it literally means . 'she who bumps into things'. She was looked after by her uncle, a . Turtle Clan chief who hated Christianity, but a conflict moved her four . miles north-west to Caughnawaga, New York, aged ten. Despite her disfigured face from . smallpox, a number of men were interested in marrying her. But Kateri . decided to stay celibate because she believed they only wanted her for . political gain. It was as she thought more about the potential of a loveless marriage, she started to find out about Christianity. Her mother had given her a set of . rosary prayer beads but her uncle had taken them away because he did not . want her to become a Catholic. But she became more and more interested . in the faith. Caterina then began Catholic teaching . in secret aged 18. Her uncle eventually allowed this as long as she . stayed in their village. Saint: Kateri, or Caterina, Tekakwitha is credited by the Vatican with Jake's miraculous recovery. She lived from 1656-1680 in the U.S. and Canada, and became the first Native American to be beatified in 1980 . She was persecuted by her fellow . villagers for joining the faith but soon escaped to the Mission of St. Francis Xavier - a Canadian settlement.She was known for her gentleness, kindness, and good humour, according to the website of her shrine in Fonda. She vowed to stay a virgin for her whole life in 1679 in Canada and taught children to pray, as well as working with the elderly and sick. She died in 1680 after a serious illness and was buried in Quebec, Canada. She was said to appear to many people after her death and held responsible for two miracles. She is joined on the list of seven newly-approved Catholic saints, including Mother Marianne of Hawaii, who cared for leprosy patients on Hawaii's Molokai peninsula in the 1880s, soon after the death of Father Damien, who was canonized in 2009. Benedict also signed decrees that 65 Catholics died as martyrs during Spain's civil war and will be beatified, one step shy of possible sainthood. The blessed: Mother Marianne cared for leprosy patients on Hawaii's Molokai peninsula . Pope Benedict XVI has approved seven new saints for the Catholic Church, including Hawaii's Mother Marianne and a 17th-century Native American, Caterina Tekakwitha. Benedict signed decrees Tuesday approving miracles attributed to the intercession of the seven, clearing the last hurdle before their canonizations. Marianne cared for leprosy patients on Hawaii's Molokai peninsula in the late 1880s, soon after the death of Father Damien, who was canonized in 2009. Tekakwitha, who lived from 1656-1680 in the U.S. and Canada, became the first Native American to be beatified in 1980. Also on the list is Italian Giovanni Battista Piamarta, born in 1841 and founder of two religious orders; French Jacques Berthieu, a Jesuit priest shot to death in Madagascar in 1896 for defending Christianity; Spanish nun Mary of Mount Carmel who in 1892 founded the Congregation of the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception. The teenager Pedro Calungsod, martyred in 1672 for defending missionaries, will be the second saint in Philippine history. Germany's Anna Schäfer, who was then bedridden for 24 years and offered her pain for the salvation of souls after suffering burns on her legs in 1901 is also among the seven blessed.","Jake Finkbonner, of Ferndale, Washington, made a stunning recovery from deadly disease that baffled doctors .

Her friend and neighbour Teresa Cerini said she was worried about Ms Ferrero after a neighbour found her cell phone in the grass by her apartment in Hill Manor. The door, Ms Cerini found, was unlocked. She found her keys, pocketbook and wallet on a chair inside Ms Ferrero’s apartment. ‘The only thing I touched was her keys. (I) locked the door and called police,’ Ms Cerini told CBSPhilly.com. Vanished: A neighbour found Ms Ferrero's apartment unlocked and her wallet sitting on a nearby chair . Damaged goods: Police found Ferrero's car parked at an odd angle with the side-view mirror missing . She also noticed her car was also parked at an odd angle and was missing its passenger-side mirror. Ms Ferrero worked as a waitress at the Starview Diner in Somerdale, New Jersey. Her co-workers are just as baffled as her friends over her tragic end. Another sever at the diner said she couldn’t believe Ms Ferrero didn’t wake up once she hit the water. ‘You’re going to be out in your bare feet and 2 o’clock in the morning when it’s freezing? I don’t know, it just doesn’t sit right with me,’ she told WPVI-TV. Co-worker Susan Murtaugh said: ‘It’s really disturbing to all of us. Sleepwalking, none of us know that ever happened with her.’ Warning signs: Neighbour Teresa Cerini says she saw Ferrero sleepwalking only a week before her death . Picturesque: Newton Lake is part of a 103-acre park . The autopsy ruled Ms Ferrero’s death an accident, though it will take several weeks for results of the toxicology report. Medications such as sleep aid Ambien have been known to cause sleepwalking. Sleepwalking often occurs during deep, non-REM sleep when the person is most asleep. While people often stay in their own homes, sleepwalkers have been known to do travel great distances. Kenneth Parks, a 23-year-old man from Toronto suffering from insomnia, drove 14 miles to his in-law’s house, killing his mother-in-law and severely injuring his father-in-law. He was acquitted in 1988 when a team of psychologists said he was ‘asleep’ and therefore unaware of his actions. One Australian woman left her apartment and had sex with strangers while sleepwalking. She was later cured in 2005. Ms Cerini said she had witnessed her sleepwalking first-hand a week and a half earlier and said she looked seemingly ‘awake,’ but not aware. Ms Cerini had woken up to a knock on her door late in the night. Shocked, she saw it was Ms Ferrero and asked what she was doing up at that hour. ‘And she goes, “I’m so sorry. The people at Table Two ordered the eggs,”’ she told WPVI-TV. Ms Cerini helped her friend home. Ms Ferrero said she used to sleepwalk as a child. ‘I said, “Guess what, honey? You still do,”’ Ms Cerini told her, telling her also that the behaviour was ‘scary and dangerous.’ The phenomenon of sleepwalking isn’t entirely understood by scientists, though it is often passed down through generations. It isn’t dangerous to walk sleepwalkers, contrary to popular belief, though they will be disoriented for some time while they regain their bearings.","Police found Charlene Ferrero Monday night after she was reported missing Sunday .

The body of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il has been laid in state in a glass coffin as weeping mourners filled public squares across the country. State television showed still images of the 'dear leader's' body in the open coffin, surrounded by wreaths and covered with a red blanket. Kim Jong Un - his third son and successor - paid his respects to his father along with top military and Workers' Party officials during a 'solemn ceremony'. In state: The body of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has been placed in a glass coffin in Kumsusan Memorial Palace, Pyongyang . Respects: The 69-year-old is surrounded by floral wreaths and his medals and is covered in a red blanket . North Korea is in an 11-day period of official mourning, with flags flown at half-mast at all military units, factories, businesses, farms and public buildings. The streets of the capital Pyongyang were quiet, but crowds of people gathered at landmarks to mourn Kim Jong Il who died suddenly on Saturday from a massive heart attack at the age of 69. Kim Jong Il ruled North Korea for 17 years in a brutal and repressive dictatorship. Under . his regime's economic mismanagement, a terrible famine in the 1990s . caused the death of millions from starvation and hardship. He imprisoned thousands of political 'opponents' and there is no . access to freedom of the press, the internet or health care in the country. Ceremony: Kim Jong Il will have a state funeral on December 28 and will be laid to rest in the palace, where the body of his father is also on display . Tears: Kim Jong Un cries as he pays his respects to his father and former leader . Successor: Kim Jong Un, heir to power in North Korea, pays his respects to his father . Duty: High level officials (L to R) Kim Phyong Hae, Thae Jong Su, Ju Kyu Chang and Kim Rak Hui - all members of the Workers' Party - weep as they pass their former leader's coffin . His body was lying in state in the . Kumsusan Memorial Palace, a mausoleum where the embalmed body of his . father - national founder Kim Il Sung - has been on display in a glass . sarcophagus since his death in 1994. A state funeral will be held there on December 28. Ri Ho Il, a lecturer at the Korean Revolutionary History Museum, said: 'Our General is our people's benevolent father. He defended our people's happiness, carrying on his forced march night and day.' Since Kim Jong Il's death, state media have stepped up their lavish praise of his son Kim Jong Un in an effort to strengthen a cult of personality around him similar to that of his father. Family: Kim Jong Un glances at his father's body as he walks past the coffin in Pyongyang . Hotseat: Kim Jong Un is expected to succeed his father after he was announced as his official heir last year . Unknown: Little is known about Kim Jong Il's third son, but he was 'unveiled' to the world media a year ago after his father suffered health problems in 2008 . Allies: The successor must now forge ties in the North Korean army and Workers' Party . Honours: Medals belonging to the former North Korean despot were on display by his coffin . Tributes: Men prepare a floral arrangement outside the North Korean embassy in Beijing, China . Grief: Workers at a branch of the North Korean consulate in Dandong, China, weep at the death of their 'dear leader' Although there have been no signs of unrest or discord in Pyongyang's sombre streets, the possibility of a power struggle in a country seeking nuclear weapons and known for its secrecy has heightened tensions in the region. Officials said they will not invite foreign delegations and will allow no entertainment during the mourning period. The Korean Central News Agency described Kim Jong Un as a 'great person born of heaven', a propaganda term only his father and grandfather Kim Il Sung had enjoyed. Genuine? Mourners appear to cry as the see the body of leader Kim Jong Il in state . Condolences: North Koreans gathered at landmarks in the capital to mourn the loss of their 'dear leader' Salute: North Korean soldiers gesture during a call of condolence in the capital . Memorial: Mourners stand in front of a floral wreath in the palace . Defiance: North Korean defectors chant slogans in Seoul after the death of Kim Jong Il . Mourning: North Korean flags are at half-mast, with many also having black ribbons tied to them . The Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of . the ruling Workers' Party, added he was 'the spiritual pillar and the . lighthouse of hope' for the people. It described him as 'born of Mount Paektu' - one of Korea's most cherished sites and Kim Jong Il's official birthplace. Yesterday, North Korea's military pledged to 'uphold the leadership of comrade Kim Jong Un' and called him a 'great successor'. Despair: Thousands crowded to pay their respects and leave flowers at memorial sites in Pyongyang . Memorial: Floral wreaths stand in front of a painting of Kim Jong Il in the capital . Protest: A man sprays paint over the North Korean flag during a demonstration in Seoul. There are concerns over the transition of power following Kim Jong Il's death . Dictator in training: Kim Jong Il was in power for 17 years as North Korea's 'dear leader'. Right, his third son Kim Jong Un was only unveiled as his successor a year ago . Kim Jong Il died from a heart attack at 8.30am North Korean time on Saturday - but officials in South Korea and the U.S. still did not know 48 hours later. Intelligence services in both countries failed to pick up on the momentous event - a testament to the highly secretive regime in North Korea. But it isn't the first time spooks have missed major developments in the country. A massive uranium enrichment plant was not discovered for 18 months until an American nuclear scientist was taken to visit it in 2010 and North Korea also helped complete a nuclear reactor in Syria without intelligence finding out. Concerns have been raised over the transition of power in the nuclear weapon-armed state, with little known of successor Kim Jong Un. Michael J. Green, a former Asia adviser in the Bush administration, told the Washington Post: 'We have clear plans about what to do if North Korea attacks, but not if the North Korean regime unravels. 'Every time you do these scenarios, one of the first objectives is trying to find out what's going on inside North Korea.' But the secretive nature of the regime means sensitive information is only shared with a small circle of high-up officials who will not reveal any details. But other countries are closely monitoring developments in the notoriously secretive country. South . Korea's military has been put on high alert and experts warned that the . next few days could be a crucial turning point for the north, which has a relatively . well-supported 1.2million-strong army. Kim Jong Il's death could set back efforts by the U.S. and others to get Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions. Concerns . are also high that his son - believed to be in his late twenties - may . feel he needs to prove himself by precipitating a crisis or displaying . his swagger on the international stage. Kim Jong Il was in power for 17 years after his father's death, and was groomed for the role years before that. His son only emerged as the likely heir over the last year. Sarah McDowall, a senior analyst with U.S.-based consultants IHS, said: 'The sudden death of Kim Jong Il has plunged the isolated state of North Korea into a period of major uncertainty. 'There are real concerns that heir-apparent Kim Jong Un has not had sufficient time to form the necessary alliances in the country to consolidate his future as leader.' Others said the country was unlikely to plunge into chaos because it has been preparing for transition since Kim Jong Il indicated his third son would become his successor. South Korea today offered condolences to its neighbour and said it would allow families with ties to the north to visit. Unification Minister Yu Woo-ik said no official delegation will travel to Pyongyang, but the government would allow the families of prominent South Koreans - including those of former president Kim Dae-jung and former Hyundai Asan chairman Chung Mong-hun. The Obama administration called for a peaceful and stable transition of power in North Korea. Top national security officials are focusing intelligence on the internal politics of the reclusive communist nation. President Obama conferred by phone with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda to underscore the U.S. commitment in the region. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said: 'We are deeply concerned with the well-being of the North Korean people and our thoughts and prayers are with them during these difficult times. 'It is our hope that the new leadership of the DPRK will choose to guide their nation on to the path of peace by honouring North Korea's commitments, improving relations with its neighbours, and respecting the rights of its people.'","Son and successor leads respects in Kumsusan Memorial Palace, Pyongyang .

"By . Damien Gayle . Last updated at 12:56 PM on 21st December 2011 . Hackers in China have managed to penetrate the computer networks of the America's top business-lobbying group, it has been claimed. All the data held by systems at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, including information about its 3million members, are said to have been left vulnerable after the infiltration. If true, the hack would be one of the boldest attacks yet in what has become an ongoing battle between Chinese hackers and companies and agencies in the U.S. Hacked: Networks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce were penetrated by hackers suspected to be working for the Chinese government . But the Chinese embassy in Washington denied that their government was behind the attacks, dubbing the allegations 'irresponsible'. The security breach, which involved the infiltration of at least 300 internet addresses, was found last year and quietly shut down, the Wall Street Journal reported. After a tip off from the FBI, computer security experts at the Chamber shut it down by unplugging and destroying some computers. Nevertheless, it is understood that hackers might have been able to access the network for more than a year before the hack was discovered. It's not clear how much of the compromised data was actually viewed and losses from data theft is often difficult to assess. Sources close to the Chamber's investigation said that hackers had focused on four employees working on Asia policy, stealing six weeks' worth of their email records. People close to the case told the Journal the emails revealed names of key firms and individuals in contact with the Chamber, policy documents, meeting notes, trip reports and schedules. The Chamber's chief operating officer, David Chavern, told the paper: 'What was unusual about it was that this was clearly somebody very sophisticated, who knew exactly who we are and who targeted specific people and used sophisticated tools to try to gather intelligence.' Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, denied the infiltration, insisting that hacking is banned under Chinese law and shouldn't be 'politicised'. He told the Journal the allegation that the attack originated in China 'lacks proof and evidence and is irresponsible.' But the attack on the Chamber's computer systems is just the latest hacking incident where the finger of suspicion has been pointed at China. Last month it emerged that Chinese agents were suspected of seizing control of U.S. government satellites on four occasions between 2007 and 2008. A Congressional report into the attacks said that, while it could not prove for sure China was behind the them, what happened was ‘consistent’ with known Chinese cyber war techniques. A Landsat-7 earth observation satellite system experienced 12 or more minutes of interference in October 2007 and July 2008. Gaining control: A report to Congress reveals efforts to hack into two government satellites in 2007 and 2008 were traced to a station in Norway . Hackers also interfered with a Terra AM-1 earth observation satellite twice, for two minutes in June 2008 and nine minutes in October that year. During the final hack ‘the responsible party achieved all steps required to command the satellite’, but did not do so, said the report by the U.S.-China Economic Security and Review Commission. Both satellites use the commercially operated Svalbard Satellite Station in Spitsbergen, Norway, that ‘routinely relies on the Internet for data access and file transfers,’ the commission said, indicating this might have been how they were attacked. The satellites affected were run by Nasa or the U.S. Geological Survey and were mostly used for climate observation. But the U.S. military and intelligence agencies also use them to communicate, collect intelligence and conduct reconnaissance.","Latest in a string of cyber attacks blamed on China .

Christmas just isn't Christmas without a turkey in the oven, the Queen's message on TV – and a cookbook by Jamie Oliver in your stocking. The 36-year-old chef has topped the seasonal bestseller chart for the fourth time in ten years with Jamie's Great Britain. He has sold 319,217 copies of the book, which accompanies the Channel 4 series of the same name, in the past three months. Fourth festive No 1: Jamie Oliver landed the Christmas number one in 2010, 2005 and 2001 . Industry experts predicted the book would be the Christmas number one as early as September with bookmakers slashing the odds to 1/2. Despite the £30 price tag, demand shows no sign of slowing and the book is expected to sell well into the New Year. Last year Jamie's 30 Minute Meals became the fastest and best-selling book in UK history. He also claimed the Christmas number one spot in 2001 with his book Happy Days with the Naked Chef and again in 2005 with Jamie's Italy. His latest book is not proving quite the same runaway success as 30 Minute Meals but he is still comfortably ahead of the second placed book. In the last week alone, Oliver's book has sold 59,156 copies, compared to 55,392 for Guinness World Records 2012, according to official figures released by sales analysts Nielsen BookScan. Cookery proved an enduring Christmas favourite with TV chefs Lorraine Pascale and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall also featuring in the top ten.

Change of plea: Sami Samir Hassoun will admit to dropping a backpack he thought held a bomb into a busy street's trash bin near Chicago Cubs' home ground Wrigley Field . A Lebanese immigrant will admit to dropping a backpack he thought held a bomb into a busy street's trash bin near Chicago Cubs' home ground Wrigley Field. Sami Samir Hassoun, 23, also talked about poisoning Lake Michigan, bombing a landmark skyscraper and assassinating the then Mayor of Chicago. He initially pleaded not guilty to charges that he received a fake bomb he believed was real from undercover FBI agents last year. But attorneys have now told a federal judge he will plead guilty under an agreement worked out with prosecutors - a deal experts say may reflect the enormous odds he would face a trial. At a hearing in Chicago, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman set a date of February 14 for Hassoun to change his plea. But neither side offered details about exactly what charges he would plead guilty to, and government and defence attorneys declined to comment after the hearing. Hassoun has a strong incentive to reduce his potential prison time via a plea deal. A conviction on just one of the charges against him - attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction - carries a maximum life prison term. Target: Hassoun dropped a backpack outside Wrigley Field, the home of Chicago Cubs . Legal expert Karen Greenberg said suspects in terrorism cases have one overwhelming incentive to cut a plea agreement and to avoid taking the case to a jury: They almost never win at trial. Greenberg, a director of the Centre on National Security at Fordham Law School in New York, said: 'And there's a very realistic chance of a very high sentence after trial. You just can't play around.' According to her centre, out of 42 defendants charged with using or attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction since the September 11 attacks, there has been just one acquittal. A total of 15 defendants have been convicted, five had the charge dropped and 21 of the cases are still pending. Another expert said federal authorities also like to avoid a trial when possible, in part from fear that revelations in court could inspire copycats or inadvertently aid would-be terrorists honing their own plots. Claims: Out of 42 defendants charged with using or attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction since the September 11 attacks, there has been just one acquittal . Michael Fagel, a professor who teaches about homeland security at Northwestern University, said: 'Maybe the same methods can be used again or terrorists can learn from another guy's mistakes.' Defence attorneys have described Hassoun as gullible and prone to wild boasts - but as having no links to extremists. They also told reporters last year they would explore the possibility of using the trial defence that Hassoun was duped by federal agents. A point of contention in recent filings was a defence request for the government to release the identity of an informant who tipped off authorities about Hassoun. That informant befriended Hassoun while at least two FBI undercover agents also got in touch, posing as co-plotters. The defence claimed the informant would have been a key figure at trial because they allege he at one point threatened Hassoun not to back out of the plot. Prosecutors say there is no evidence of any such threat and that identifying the confidential source would open him up to reprisals. While the pressure to cut a plea deal is heaviest on the defence, Greenberg said prosecutors often do not want to see their investigations subject to scrutiny. She said legitimate questions have been raised in this and other cases about whether there was some element of entrapment by federal agents. The jailed Hassoun, a one-time bakery worker, did not appear at Tuesday's hearing. He has shown up at earlier hearings - occasionally lifting his shackled hands to blow kisses to his mother on a spectators' bench. According to prosecutors, Hassoun waffled about his plans, allegedly talking about profiting monetarily and another time broaching the idea of poisoning Lake Michigan or assassinating then-Chicago Mayor Richard M Daley. While it was harmless, prosecutors have said the device planted by Hassoun near Wrigley Field appeared ominous - a paint can fitted with blasting caps and a timer. Hassoun was deadly serious about the plot and it was 'not a matter of talk or bravado', prosecutor Joel Hammerman told a judge shortly after Hassoun's arrest last year.","Sami Samir Hassoun, 23, caught in FBI sting .

"By . Jack Doyle and Michael Seamark . Last updated at 10:43 PM on 21st December 2011 . The judge behind a ‘whitewash’ review of extradition has admitted he had not met Gary McKinnon, the Asperger’s sufferer who faces being sent to the U.S. for trial on hacking charges. Lord Justice Scott Baker told MPs that while preparing his report into the treaty between Britain and the U.S. he did not speak to Mr McKinnon, his mother Janis, his legal team or any other suspects facing extradition to America. Instead, the former high court judge travelled to the U.S. to spend a week with prosecutors involved in extradition cases. Lord Justice Scott Baker (left) did not speak to Gary McKinnon (right) while preparing his reporting on an extradition treaty under which Gary could be sent to the U.S. for allegedly hacking into Pentagon and Nasa computers . MPs passed a motion this month for . ‘urgent reform’ of the treaty. Critics say it is biased in favour of . America, which requires stronger evidence than the UK for the . extradition of its citizens. Lord Justice Scott Baker . But the Baker review rejected that charge, and found there was no . significant difference in the legal protection available in the two . countries. He defended his review on Tuesday before MPs on the Home . Affairs Committee. He insisted that not a single Briton sent to the U.S. would have escaped . extradition if the wording of the treaty had been the same in both . countries. But chairman Keith Vaz asked why he had not spoken to British . citizens affected by the treaty, such as Mr McKinnon – the subject of . the Mail’s Affront To British Justice campaign – David Birmingham or . Babar Ahmad. Mr McKinnon, who is autistic, admits hacking into Nasa and Pentagon computers to look for evidence of ‘little green men’. Mr Birmingham was one of the ‘NatWest Three’ charged with fraud in the . U.S. in 2002, extradited there in 2006 and sentenced to 37 months in . jail in 2010. He has since been released. Babar Ahmad, 37, of Tooting, South West London, was arrested under a . U.S. extradition request in 2004 on suspicion of supporting terrorism . and has been detained without charge in a British jail ever since. Mr Vaz said: ‘As part of your review you didn’t actually meet Janis McKinnon or any representatives of the Babar Ahmad case. Janis Sharp has been leading the fight to stop her son Gary from being extradited to the U.S. ‘So although you managed to go to Washington for a week you weren’t able . to call in people like David Birmingham, you weren’t able to call in . the McKinnon team, you weren’t able to call in Babar Ahmad’s team.’ But Lord Justice Scott Baker said he had received written evidence from . Mr McKinnon’s lawyers. ‘Janis McKinnon sent reams of material in, and . the suggestion that we don’t understand the plight of persons sought to . be extradited is, I’m afraid, not accepted,’ he added. 'He definitely should have heard from us and I would have told him how completely unfair and unequal the Extradition Treaty is' Janis Sharp,Gary McKinnon's mother . He said the review did not look at individual cases, but extradition in . general, adding: ‘They were all invited to give evidence in writing and . many did. If there were issues we wanted to explore further and we . thought we could get assistance, we did.’ Mr Vaz said it must have been a ‘disappointment’ that senior Coalition . politicians had rejected his findings after Deputy Prime Minister Nick . Clegg responded to the report by commissioning his own and Attorney . General Dominic Grieve said the recommendations were just ‘guidelines’. However, Lord Justice Scott Baker said: ‘I don’t have any . disappointment. I simply produced a report and it’s up to the . politicians to do what they want with it. We think our recommendations . are right.’ Last night Mr McKinnon’s mother Janis Sharp said: ‘He definitely should have heard from us. ‘I would have told him how completely unfair and unequal the treaty is, . how this has totally destroyed Gary, totally destroyed our family. ‘But I think it would have fallen on deaf ears. Scott Baker’s report was . a whitewash and I think he was completely blinkered. Why should we need . the Americans’ input? ‘It’s ludicrous that he even went to Washington to speak to their . officials because they have already made up their minds about Gary.’",Gary's defence team sent 'a great deal of material' for him to read .

A holiday rip-off that sees banks charge travellers £20million in fees to buy foreign currency with debit cards is to end. Five of the country’s biggest banks will drop the charge following pressure from consumer groups and the Office of Fair Trading. The fee is generally 1.5 to 2 per cent of the value of the amount of currency being bought. Scrapped: Banks have agreed to stop charging holidaymakers for buying foreign currency with debit cards . It is one of a number of stealth . charges used by banks to make an estimated £1.1billion a year from those . who use debit and credit cards for their foreign currency. The decision to scrap it is predicted . to save families and business travelers around £20million a year. Official customer body Consumer Focus pointed out the actual cost to a . bank of processing a debit card foreign currency purchase is around 9p, . however customers were being charged up to £4.50. Banks also generally take a percentage of the value of any foreign card transaction and then add a second service charge. As a result, someone taking £200 out of a foreign cash machine can be charged almost £10. Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, Royal . Bank of Scotland, Santander and the Co-operative Bank have all agreed to . remove the fees imposed on customers who buy foreign currency with a . debit card. This brings them into line with Nationwide, HSBC and Halifax . Bank of Scotland, who do not charge a fee. The decision by the five banks follows talks with OFT officials and a complaint from Consumer Focus. They have agreed to give  ‘clearer, . more accessible’ information about charges for using  cards abroad and . many foreign exchanges have agreed to review marketing practices. However there are suspicions banks will grab back the cash by pushing up other charges. Consumer Focus chief Mike O’Connor . said: ‘It is only right this unfair cost, which effectively charges . customers for taking money out of their own account, is stopped.’ Marketing ploys: Banks will look into campaigns which are based around 0 per cent commission deals . Will buying travel money be cheaper? Currently, buying £500 worth of euros over the counter with your debit card would mean an additional fee of between £10 and £30. Five banks – Barclays, Co-operative Bank, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander – currently impose a charge of 1.5 and 2 per cent on customers using their debit cards to withdraw foreign currency before leaving the UK. They have all agreed to scrap these charges by the end of 2012 under the new rules. It will mean that travellers can use their debt cards to buy foreign currency from banks, bureau de change, the Post Office and travel agents without being charged to use their debit card. There will be still be a charge for credit cards. The UK Cards Association and British Bankers Association has agreed that banks and lenders will give clearer, more accessible information about using cards abroad on websites, statements and through call centres. What about when you’re abroad? Currently banks and credit card companies hide the cost of using your card abroad within the items travellers have bought. They will now have to show the charge, typically called a ‘loading fee’ usually of around 3 per cent, separately on bank statements. Lloyds/HBOS, HSBC, Co-operative Bank, Capital One, RBS/Natwest and American Express have agreed to display the actual charges incurred by customers for using cards abroad far more clearly on their monthly and annual statements. This will mean that customers can more easily work out how much they’re paying for foreign currency and give them the ability to shop around to get better deals. What about pre-paid cards? Pre-paid cards, which are loaded with currency before you go on holiday, often advertise 0 per cent commission offers but sting customers by pushing up exchange rates so they are not fee free – the OFT is forcing firms to review this strategy to reveal the exact costs. Will the changes lead to less generous exchange rates? As firms are forced to cut back on money making fees when proving currency there are some fears this may mean less generous exchange rates for customers. A spokesman from Consumer Focus said that it would hope that competition between banks and other players such as the Post Office and bureaux de change would keep rates competitive. However, it is up to individual firms to decide at what rate they set the exchange at. If banks and others wish to offset the revenue lost from a ban on debit card fees with higher exchange rates, the rules mean customers will at least be able to identify and compare the advertised exchange rate of different providers.","Banks can no longer charge travellers for buying foreign currency with debit cards .

"By . Andy Dolan . Last updated at 9:56 PM on 20th December 2011 . A former clergyman who gave away a pet water buffalo yesterday lost a final legal attempt to have the animal returned. John Kirby claimed he was delusional when he transferred Oink the buffalo and the one-acre field where he was kept to a friend who lived in the same village. He took his case to the county court last year, claiming mental health problems meant he lacked the capacity to make sensible decisions at the time of the handover in 2006. 'Disgusting decision': Former clergyman John Kirby has lost a Court of Appeal battle to have Oink the water buffalo (pictured) returned after a judge dismissed claims he was delusional when he transferred the beast to a friend . But a judge ruled against Mr Kirby, 51, after hearing evidence from a psychiatrist who believed Mr Kirby knew what he was doing when he made the ‘gift’ to Katherine Moore. Yesterday, the Court of Appeal backed the decision, bringing an end to the saga over the 18-year-old beast. Lord Justice Jackson said there would be ‘no kindness’ in allowing Mr Kirby's appeal to go any further as it had no hope of success and would only result in a bigger costs bill. Outside court, Mr Kirby, from Darley Dale, Derbyshire, branded the decision ‘absolutely despicable, disgraceful and disgusting’. Oink became the subject of worldwide attention in 2008 when CCTV cameras were installed to protect him from cruel thugs who had thrown bricks at him, laced his food with mustard, put detergent in his water and set fire to his hay. Long legal fight: Oink and the field in which he was kept in Darley Dale, Derbyshire, was handed to Katherine Moore in 2006 . Lord Justice Jackson told the Appeal Court that Mr Kirby had been suffering from anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders when he signed over the animal in May 2006. He gave the 1.25-tonne animal to Miss Moore, who also had ‘much affection’ for the beast and was able to look after him, keeping him on the land where Mr Kirby could visit. Lord justice Jackson . In his appeal application in London, Mr Kirby, representing himself, argued that Nottingham County Court judge, Recorder Mark Anderson QC, was wrong in his decision last year. He said the judge was wrong to reject his contention that he did not have capacity to make the gift and wrong to find that he had not been subject to ‘undue influence’. But Lord Justice Jackson said the . Nottingham County Court judge had ‘assessed the conflicting expert . reports, looked at the contemporaneous records of the claimant's medical . conditions and reached a conclusion which seems to me to be plainly . open to him.’ The Appeal . Court judge said: ‘The relationship between the claimant and the . defendant was not a relationship of a kind which gives rise to a claim . for undue influence. ‘The . claimant did not repose such degree of trust and confidence in the . defendant as to give rise to a presumption of undue influence.' Bleak message: The judge at the Court of Appeal (above) said Mr Kirby had no hope of his appeal going any further. he now faces paying most of Miss Moore's legal costs . He added: ‘I appreciate that my decision will be a great disappointment to the claimant and I am sorry to be the messenger who brings that disappointment to the claimant. ‘On the other hand, facts must be faced. This is not an appeal which would have any prospect of success if it went forward. The appeal would fail and the claimant would be landed with a further bill of costs.’ Mr Kirby faces paying 90 per cent of Mrs Moore's legal costs of the county court trial, but said he has not yet been told how much that will be. Miss Moore, 62, a divorcee, yesterday said the ruling was ‘brilliant news’. Speaking from her home in Darley Abbey, she said: ‘I had been effectively looking after Oink for seven years before I took him on in 2006. ‘I used to go past that field and feed him so often he’d end up waiting for me at the gate. ‘John agreed to give me Oink and sold me the field for £2,000 which was the market value. Then he turned around and claimed I’d ripped him off. He is a complete menace.’","Appeal Court judge rules John Kirby knew what he was doing when he transferred Oink to friend .

A train conductor who was so drunk he got out of the carriage and was left stranded on a station platform has avoided jail. The train that Simon Stansfield was responsible for made it 15 miles - from Dundee to Carnoustie - before the driver was alerted to his absence. The packed Inverurie-bound train then had to return to Dundee from the Angus town to pick up the guard - who was three times the legal alcohol limit and was still on the platform. Dundee Sheriff Court was told by fiscal depute Ross Cargill that Stansfield was responsible for telling the driver when it was safe to depart. He was also in charge of passenger safety and for operating the system to lock the doors and deactivate the braking system, the court heard. Mr Cargill said Stansfield was working on the ScotRail 4.38pm service on November 19 when the . driver thought he heard a buzzer sounding indicating it was safe to . leave and heard the braking system being released before moving the . train forward. The prosecutor added: 'As the train departed, the accused was left on the station platform. 'Mr Cox, the station supervisor, was approached by Mr Stansfield and . told what had happened. The driver was contacted and stopped the train. 'While speaking to Mr Stansfield, Mr Cox smelled alcohol on his breath and contacted the controller. 'The British Transport Police were contacted and Mr Stansfield was breathalysed. 'He said he had last had a drink at 10am that morning.' Mr Cargill said . the breathalyser showed a preliminary reading of 110 mics of alcohol. Abandoned: The packed ScotRail train (not pictured) had to return to Dundee to pick up the guard, who was three times the legal alcohol limit and was still on the platform . Stansfield was taken to police HQ in Dundee where a blood test revealed a level of 120 mics. Stansfield, 45, Dundee, pleaded guilty to a charge . that, being a person who works on a transport system and who controlled . the movement of a vehicle, he worked with excess alcohol in his system. The court heard he had 120 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres breath - more than three times the limit of 35. Alan Lyle, defending, said Stansfield had no idea how the doors of the . train had managed to lock with him still standing on the platform. He said: 'He pressed two buttons to close the doors except the one where he would get on. 'He was looking along the train to ensure the hazard lights were off and . as he was about to get back on the train the doors closed. 'It is his position that he did nothing to make them close and doesn't know why they started to. 'He started to walk along to see the driver and at that the train started to pull away, leaving him on the platform. 'He has resigned from his position and has seen his GP to address his alcohol problem. 'He's very ashamed of the position that he finds himself in.' Sheriff . Richard Davidson said a drunk conductor was 'not a novel situation for . Scotrail' - referring to the 2008 case of Thomas Gracie, who was found . slumped in the cab of the train after passengers were unable to alight . at Edinburgh Waverley station. Sheriff Davidson fined Stansfield £1,000 and said: 'The public have . to be confident that they can get on a train and it will operate . safely. 'The way Scotrail operate is that there is a driver and a conductor who are to be compos mentis. 'On that day you were in such a bad way for drink that you could not possibly carry out the requirements of your office. 'As such to some extent the public were placed at risk by your state and that's completely unacceptable.'",ScotRail guard three times the legal alcohol limit .
"By . Luke Salkeld . Last updated at 1:02 AM on 21st December 2011 . A gang of bullying car clampers extorted up to £350,000 from motorists while laughing off their desperate protests. In a judgment that will be cheered by thousands of victims of clamping cowboys, Carlton Williams, 47, Lee Stagg, 43, and Michael Riddle, 30, were jailed for a total of ten years. Two of the men had also been claiming tens of thousands in illegal benefit payments. Carlton Williams (left) Lee Stagg (centre) and Michael Riddle (right) netted up to £350,000 by intimidating members of the public into paying clamping fees . The gang would pounce on unsuspecting . drivers – often women with young children – and charge them as much as . £600 to get their cars back. Police estimate the trio could have . pocketed £350,000 from their three-year clamping scam before they were . eventually arrested on blackmail and fraud charges. The court was told that they used a ‘spotter’ who would lurk near . private land they managed on behalf of shops and businesses, waiting to . catch motorists parking. As soon as they left their car, it would be clamped and a tow truck would be sent within minutes to haul it away. Notices stated that the price of releasing a clamp was £100, but if  the . vehicle was towed away this increased to £350, rising again to £500 . once ‘storage fees’ were applied. When the driver returned, the clampers would then aggressively confront . them, often giving them little chance to pay the minimum release fee. Sometimes the gang lifted cars on to tow trucks with drivers still at . the wheel. Police were inundated with complaints that the clampers were . demanding up to £600 to get their cars back. Taunton Crown Court heard the trio operated as A1 Clamping Services from . 2005 to 2008 at a base in Bridgwater in Somerset. Don Tait, . prosecuting, told the court: ‘The sums involved were eye-watering.’ Police say Williams (left) was the ringleader of the gang. Along with Stagg (centre) and riddle (right) he ran the 'bullying' enterprise for three years . Williams and Stagg were also found to have illegally claimed £54,000 in . council tax benefit, housing benefit and income support. They were also . not paying income tax or national insurance. Jailing the three men, Judge Graham Hume Jones said: ‘In the course of . this business you extorted considerable sums of money from members of . the public by arrogant, bullying and aggressive behaviour. The gang would often clamp cars as soon as drivers had parked them . ‘You were licensed to clamp cars and had a form of uniform and badges to show your authenticity. ‘In my judgment this aggravates the position because it gave the . impression the sums you were demanding and the behaviour you were . exhibiting was authentic. You caused great distress and anxiety to the . car owners.’ One of their victims, Sally Mendonca, an Army major from . York, said she had been visiting a relative in Devon when her car was . clamped and towed. She said: ‘I explained I was just back from Iraq for a short time and . all my military kit was in that car and how urgently I needed it. He . laughed and said, “I get told these stories all the time”. ’ A female . victim told how she was inside her car when they lifted it up to tow it . off. Another, Chloe Brant, who successfully got the clamping gang to release . her car after calling the police, was warned: ‘I will get you next . time.’ Williams, from Bridgwater, was jailed for five-and-a-half years after . pleading guilty to blackmail and making unwarranted demands for money . with menaces. He also admitted benefit fraud totalling £42,518 and . engaging in an aggressive commercial practice. Stagg, also from Bridgwater, admitted blackmail, making unwarranted . demands with menaces and benefit fraud totalling £12,000, and was jailed . for three years. Riddle, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, was handed . an 18-month term for his part in the clamping scam after pleading guilty . to conspiracy to blackmail and making unwarranted demands for money. After sentencing, police said the operation to snare Williams, Stagg and . Riddle had taken four years. Sergeant Paul Endicott, from Avon and . Somerset Constabulary, said: ‘They were able to charge what they wanted . as there was no defined law to control their activities.’","Carlton Williams, Lee Stagg and Michael Riddle intimidated their victims, often women with young .

"By . James Chapman . Last updated at 11:35 PM on 19th December 2011 . Nick Clegg attacked the House of Lords yesterday, describing it as an ‘affront’ to liberal democracy. Forming an upper chamber using proportional representation has emerged as a key Liberal Democrat demand for staying in a coalition with the Conservatives. The Deputy Prime Minister said legislation to replace the Lords with elected senators would be introduced early next year. And in an attempt to cheer his party’s core supporters, he also argued for a ‘liberal approach to tax’ that would distinguish between earned income and ‘unearned wealth’. Pledge: Nick Clegg, pictured today, vowed that reform of the House of Lords will go ahead as he delivered the annual Demos Lecture at Westminster Central Hall . Lib Dem sources said the party would push for a ‘mansion tax’ on expensive properties, or new taxes on high earners’ pensions. On Lords reform, Mr Clegg said a Bill . will be introduced for a mostly elected upper chamber – a change that . could be forced past the Lords and into law by use of the Parliament Act . if necessary. Until now, Mr Clegg had taken a back . seat on the issue – allowing Tory Cabinet Office minister Mark Harper to . take the lead – but aides say he is now making Lords reform a key Lib . Dem policy, despite significant opposition from Conservative MPs and . peers. The move would finally break the link . between peerages and the permanent right to sit in the legislature, . following decades of controversy over ‘cash for honours’. Reform: Nick Clegg today promised to use the Parliament Act if necessary to push through reform of the House of Lords. The Lib Dems want an 80 per cent elected upper chamber . At least 80 per cent of senators . would be elected using the single transferable vote electoral system . long favoured by the Liberal Democrats. The system is likely to result . in no party having an overall majority in the second chamber, as is the . case currently. Prime ministers would still be able to appoint a small number of unelected senators to temporary seats in the Lords. There are almost 800 members of the . House of Lords, making it the second-largest legislative body in the . world after the Chinese People’s Congress – but, on average, only 388 . attend each day. Under the Coalition’s plans, the . Lords would be transformed over 15 years into a largely elected chamber . with 300 members. Constitutional reform: Labour removed all but the last 92 hereditary peers from the House of Lords in 1999, however the second phase of reform stalled and was never completed . Critics argue that an elected second chamber would . demand greater powers to block legislation from the Commons, although . ministers insist none are planned. Speaking at the think-tank Demos, Mr Clegg described the Lords as ‘perhaps the most potent symbol of a closed society’. ‘The Lords as currently constituted is an affront to the principles of openness which underpin a modern democracy,’ he said. The Deputy Prime Minister . acknowledged he would need ‘a significant degree of cross-party . consensus on this, and indeed support from Lords themselves’, but added: . ‘Let there be no doubt: if it comes to a fight, the will of the Commons . will prevail.’",Deputy PM vows to use Parliament Act to force through House of Lords reform if necessary .

Iraq's top Sunni official is set to be arrested on terrorism charges by the country's Shiite-led government. Just a day after the last U.S. troops left Iraq at the end of the eight-year war, the moves signals a sharp escalation in the sectarian tensions that drove the country to the brink of civil war a few years ago. An arrest warrant has been issued for vice-president Tariq al-Hashemi after state-run television aired what it claimed were confessions by alleged terrorists linked to him. Since the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein and his Sunni-dominated Baath party, the Sunni minority has constantly complained of attempts by the Shiite majority to sideline them. Mr Al-Hashemi is one of the leaders of the Sunni-backed political bloc Iraqiya, which has just suspended its participation in parliament to protest against the control of key posts by Shiite prime minister Nouri al-Maliki . More... Libyan revolutionary Britain 'handed over to Gaddafi's henchmen' sues and could be in line for £1m payout at taxpayers' expense . 'I feel wretched': Woman protester who was stripped and dragged through streets by Egyptian soldiers breaks her silence . Saudi prince invests $300million in Twitter... even though political activists have their accounts blocked in his country . The boycott, headed by Ayad Allawi, was in response to the government's failure to share more powers, particularly authority over the security forces. Iraqiya narrowly won the most seats in last year's parliamentary election, but Mr Allawi was outmanoeuvered by Mr al-Maliki, who kept the premier's post after cobbling together key support from Shiite parties. Withdrawal: Nouri al-Maliki, pictured with Barack Obama last week, is in control of defence and security forces . For over a year now, Mr al-Maliki has effectively controlled the interior and defence ministries, which oversee the police and military, while conflicts between Sunni and Shiite politicians have delayed the appointment of permanent ministers. The dispute is a reminder that the West left behind an Iraq still riven by sectarian division. The last American troops crossed the border into neighbouring Kuwait early on Sunday. Mr al-Hashemi has denied charges he ran a hit squad that killed government officials during the wave of sectarian bloodletting and accused the Shiite-led government of persecution. 'I'm shocked with all these things,' he said. 'I swear by God that al-Hashemi didn't do any sin or anything wrong against any Iraqi whether today or tomorrow and this my pledge to God.' Tensions: An Iraqi man walks past a banner celebrating the withdrawal of U.S. troops, but just a day after their departure the top Sunni official is wanted over terrorism charges . He blamed prime minister Nouri al-Maliki for waging a campaign to 'embarrass' him. He added: 'Al-Maliki is behind the whole issue. The country is in the hands of al-Maliki. All the efforts that had been exerted to reach national reconciliation and to unite Iraq are now gone.' Al-Hashemi is in Iraq's semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region and is not in custody. He thanked Iraq's President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, for his support and said that Talabani promised he would be responsible for his security. The vice president said security officials had come to his office and house and taken computers and documents. He said the staff working in his office were asked to turn in their badges and told to go home. Al-Hashemi also sought to play down speculation that he would flee the country. He said that while he might leave for a short period of time, he would always return to Iraq. By 2007, the number of sectarian attacks in Iraq - many of them within 30 miles of the capital Baghdad - was virtually at a civil war level. Hundreds are still killed by sectarian groups or insurgents as they seek to exploit the government. As the U.S. military leaves the country, there are fears it could again erupt into civil war, with ethnic unrest spilling over into neighbouring countries including Jordan and Syria. An Iraqiya MP warned that the party could pull its seven ministers out of the coalition government if its demands are not met. In a statement issued on Saturday, Iraqiya criticized the 'unjustified' random arrests conducted by the government's security forces in Sunni areas.","Tariq al-Hashemi wanted after state television aired 'confessions' by alleged terrorists .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:35 AM on 20th December 2011 . A woman is facing a race against time to lose four stone - in order to become pregnant before her husband dies. Ayla Hughes, 24 hopes to have a child with her husband Ben, 28, who suffers from chronic organ failure. Doctors have told former shop worker Mr Hughes he only has five months to live. Final wish: Terminally ill Ben Hughes, hopes his wife Ayla will have started IVF treatment before he dies . However, the couple have a million-to-one chance . of conceiving naturally, as Ayla has polycystic ovaries and Ben’s sperm . count has been reduced by years of daily medication and operations. Childcare assistant Ayla, from Shrewsbury, has lost a stone-and-a-half so far through joining a slimming club and exercising. She said: 'The news was devastating, but we’re concentrating on fulfilling the dreams we have together. 'I’ve already lost more than a stone through Slimming World, but I still have three and a half stone to go. 'I want to get the weight lost by March next year, which will hopefully give Ben time to realise that the procedures have worked and he’s on his way to becoming a dad.' Ben has been through a series of operations throughout his life to correct Aortic Stenosis, a condition which has left his heart unable to pump blood properly. He married Ayla in February 2007 - and underwent a double transplant to replace his faulty heart and lungs a month later. But last month he was given the tragic news that his body is now rejecting the organs - giving him just six months to live. Becoming a father is at the top of Ben's 'bucket list' - a wishlist of experiences he'd like to have before he dies. Ben and Ayla Hughes on their wedding day in February 2007: He underwent a double transplant a month later but his body is now rejecting the new heart and lungs . He said: 'We have been thinking about having a baby for around three years, but with everything else going on, we just haven’t been able to concentrate on it properly. 'Now there is more need to get the IVF underway as soon as possible.Although I may not be around to hold my child, as long as I know the IVF has started and Ayla is alright, it will mean the world to me.' Couples need to meet strict criteria to be considered for IVF and at 19-and-a-half stone Ayla was judged to be too overweight. The national IVF success rate is around 30 per cent - meaning Ayla and Ben face a daunting challenge even if she does manage to slim to 14-and-half stone. She has already lost a stone and a half, taking her weight to 18 stone, but must lose at least three and a half more to qualify for the treatment. 'These past five years have been the best. Ben is the most wonderful person I have ever met and he’s changed my life,' Ayla said. 'If it wasn’t for the transplant, we would not have had this time together. Now I have the most powerful incentive imaginable to lose weight.' Ben has also joined in Ayla’s diet to help give her encouragement. He said: 'I’m doing all the things a normal supportive husband would do. I’m eating what she’s eating, which makes it easier for her. 'Whenever I catch her reaching for sweet treats, I give her a little smack on the hand. 'It’s been helpful to concentrate on achieving this together. It’s been nice to have something to occupy our minds.' Ben drew up his bucket list earlier this year as his condition worsened. He also hopes to swim with sharks, visit the set of Coronation Street and meet hero David Bowie. But he added: 'Having a son or daughter would be a wonderful thing to leave to our families - it would be a part of me which would continue living after I’m gone.' Ben and Ayla are hoping that their plight will help inspire others to sign up for the organ donor register. For more information, visit https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk .

Galaxy S II smartphone: BT's lawsuit joins other patent lawsuits against Google's Android operating system from companies such as Microsoft, Apple and Oracle . Steve Jobs famously said that Google's Android was a 'stolen product' and that he would spend all of Apple's money, if necessary, to fight the phone operating system. Apple and Microsoft are already suing Google for alleged patent infringement. Now telecoms giant BT has joined the fight, alleging that Google has infringed BT's patents with technologies found in Google's Android system, as well as Google search and Google Maps. The case focuses on six patents owned by BT. How realistic this latest suit is remains to be seen. BT famously sued internet service providers such as Prodigy and AOL in 2002 for patent infringement relating to hyperlinks - the links that form the structure of the entire internet. BT wanted a licence fee from each and every internet service provider that used hyperlinks - ie all internet service providers. The suit failed. The telecoms giant has filed legal proceedings at the US District Court of Delaware and is seeking unspecified damages as well as an injunction against Google's continued use of Google search, Android and Google Maps. The move follows legal action by Apple, Microsoft, Oracle and others, which have all made claims against Google's Android system. A BT spokesman said: 'This is about protecting BT's investment in its intellectual property rights and innovation. It is a well-considered claim and we believe there is a strong case of infringement.' BT has spent more than £5 billion on research and development in the last five years. The suit revolves around six patents held by BT - a technology giant which holds 5,600 patents . A Google spokeswoman said: 'We believe these claims are groundless and we will vigorously defend ourselves against them.' If successful, the suit could mean that Google or mobile handset makers will have to pay BT royalties on each Android handset in use and which they produce. In documents submitted to the courts, BT claims Google offers a range of products and services that 'incorporate' technology invented by BT prior to Google's founding. BT claims services including Google Music, Android, Google Plus, Google Maps, Google Books and eBooks all infringe BT's own patents. BT has a total worldwide portfolio of around 5,600 patents and applications.","BT owns 5,600 patents .

A woman was today caring for her baby born on the roof of a submerged medical centre amid the devastation of Typhoon Washi, which killed more than 1,000 in the Philippines last weekend. Annaliza Tumanda gave birth to her daughter, Aizee, at the height of the storm and flash floods that destroyed their home in the southern region of Mindanao. Today she was at a government run shelter, where aid workers are battling to head off a humanitarian disaster in the wake of the tempest. 'With God's will, we survived,' she told the Associated Press. 'It was like a miracle.' Aizee Tumanda, the six-day-old infant who was born on the roof of a clinic submerged in floodwaters, is caressed by her siblings and relatives inside the basketball court turned evacuation centre in Cagayan de Oro . Flash floods had forced Mrs Tumanda, her husband and their three children - aged between three and eight - to flee their home in the city of Cagayan do Oro late on Friday night. In the lashing rain and fierce winds, the family swam through the floodwaters to a nearby three storey house, the strain and shock sending Mrs Tumanda into labour. Rescuers from the Filipino police were able to reach them in the disaster zone on Saturday morning, and brought her through the devastation to the roof of a nearby medical centre. On top of the submerged clinic, Mrs Tumanda gave birth to a healthy 6.6lb baby girl. She is now just another of the 640,000 who have had their lives ripped apart by the disaster, according to United Nations estimates. Annaliza Tumanda watches over baby Aizee sleeping. Just before going into labour, she and her family were forced to flee their home after the tropical storm hit their neighbourhood . Big yawn: Mrs Tumanda caresses baby Aizee's forehead.

About 45,000 displaced are inside makeshift refugee camps, most of them in worst-hit Iligan and Cagayan de Oro cities in the southern Mindanao region. Another 266,000 are being assisted outside the temporary shelters. Aid workers were rushing in relief supplies, but a lack of running water is a major concern.

Newt Gingrich's father was a wife-beating cheater who boasted about his conquests with other woman in front of her, reports the National Enquirer. But the Republican presidential candidate, known as a strong opponent of domestic violence, later forgave his dad Newton 'Big Newt' McPherson. Mr McPherson married Kathleen 'Kit' Daugherty in 1942 in Middletown, Pennsylvania, but just over three years later in 1945 they were divorced. GOP candidate: Newt Gingrich's father was allegedly a wife-beating cheater who often boasted about his conquests with other woman in front of her . ‘On the third day of their marriage newlywed bliss turned into a nightmare,’ a family source told the National Enquirer. Mrs McPherson, aged 16 at the time, became pregnant as soon as she got married but her husband, 19, began to beat her, the source claimed. Mr McPherson joined the Navy and was reportedly not around to see the birth of his son, who would go on to become a House Speaker. Divorce papers said Mr McPherson would ‘frequently become drunk’, call his wife names, 'strike' her and not ‘display proper interest in his family’. Happily married: Republican hopeful Newt Gingrich signs autographs as his wife Callista, right, looks on as they campaign in Mt Pleasant, Iowa, on Tuesday . After their divorce she met and married Bob Gingrich after meeting at a roller rink. He adopted their son, reported the National Enquirer. 'On the third day of their marriage newlywed bliss turned into a nightmare' National Enquirer source . Mrs McPherson - who then became Mrs Gingrich - went on to have three more children with her new husband, including Candace Gingrich-Jones. Newt Gingrich’s gay half-sister has hit the headlines for slamming his opposition to gay marriage - and saying she would back Barack Obama. Mr McPherson died in 1970, Bob Gingrich in 1996 and Mrs Gingrich, also known as Mrs McPherson, in 2003, reported the National Enquirer. Second wife: Mr Gingrich married Marianne Ginther in 1981, six months after his divorce with his previous spouse was finalised . Many critics of Newt Gingrich say he still has to convince doubters who say his personal past makes him unfit to become President. He has said voters should look to the 'strong marriage' he has with his current wife Callista and consider the 'forgiveness' he sought from God. Mr Gingrich married his first wife Jackie Battley, his former high school geometry teacher, in 1962 when he was 19 years old and she was 26. They had two daughters, Kathy and Jackie. But in the spring of 1980, they split after he had an affair with Marianne Ginther. She went on to become his second wife in 1981. But in the mid-1990s, he began an affair with House staffer Callista Bisek. They married in 2000.","Dad Newton McPherson was married for three years .

"By . Daniel Martin . Last updated at 3:43 AM on 21st December 2011 . It was all smiles and festive cheer when David Cameron dropped in on British troops for a coffee and a chat during a surprise Christmas trip to Afghanistan yesterday. But back home, anger was mounting against the Government for capping military pay rises at 1 per cent a year from 2013 – a real-terms cut. Mr Cameron was forced to admit that the Coalition had ‘more to do’ to uphold the Military Covenant as top brass and military charities lined up to blast him over a plan which has hit morale at a time when the Army, Royal Navy and RAF are already facing crippling cuts. Relaxed: David Cameron having coffee with troops at a base in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan . David Cameron had been due to go to Camp Bastion but a sand storm meant he had to land at Kandahar instead . The pay squeeze for the military came . despite the Government hiking benefits, including unemployment payments . and disability living allowance, by a record 5.2 per cent. The Prime Minister said: ‘There is . always more to be done. We have gone a long way to get it [the covenant] . into law, giving it real teeth [but] we have got further to go.’ The row simmered as the Government . published a report on how it was strengthening the covenant. The . 116-page document highlighted ‘concerns’ among the rank-and-file over . pay and perks, healthcare and education. The Royal British Legion also flagged . up continuing worries about long-term care for wounded servicemen and . women, support for reservists and the handling of veterans’ complaints. Wearing a fleece, khaki trousers and . military-style boots, Mr Cameron had been due to make a morale-boosting . trip to Camp Bastion in Helmand province, where most British forces are . based. But his RAF flight . was forced to divert because a dust storm caused the Camp Bastion runway . to be shut for the first time this year. Instead, the C-17 Globemaster had to . land at Kandahar airfield, where only a small proportion of the 9,500 UK . troops deployed in Afghanistan are based. Commenting on the dust storm that prevented his visit to Helmand, Mr Cameron said: 'It's slightly changed our plan' adding 'there's no point whingeing about it' At Kandahar, Mr Cameron took the opportunity to meet members of RAF 12(B) Squadron - from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland - who fly the Tornado fighter jet on missions all over Afghanistan. In a reference to the weather - the first day of poor visibility after weeks of clear skies - the Prime Minister joked: 'It’s slightly changed our plan.' Wearing a black Berghaus fleece, khaki chinos and boots, Mr Cameron was shown around a Tornado. He also met US General James Huggins, the head of Isaf Regional Command South, for talks on military progress in Afghanistan. And he had a chat over a mug of tea with soldiers and air personnel in the Naafi canteen. But . plans to take a helicopter to Lashkar Gah to meet the governor of . Helmand and visit a frontline base in the province had to be abandoned. The Prime Minister's visit was meant as a pre-Christmas morale booster for troops . Mr Cameron was given a tour of the base and shown one of the Tornado fighters from 12 (B) squadron . Speaking . to journalists on the trip, Mr Cameron admitted it was 'disappointing' but said British troops in Afghanistan faced the same issues every day. 'You just have to take it as it comes in this job,' he said. 'What we have experienced today is what people working out here experience the whole time.' He said there was 'no point whingeing about it' and he had been able to meet service personnel he would not usually see. 'You . just have to take the rough with the smooth; I don’t feel particularly . jinxed,' he added in response to the suggestion that he faced regular . difficulties on foreign trips. The Prime Minister was due to go to Lashkar Gah to visit the governor of Helmand but the trip had to be abandoned . The Prime Minister defended imposing a one per cent pay rise cap for troops from 2013, insisting the money was better spent on increasing the operational allowance for those on active duty overseas. He said: 'I think we are doing the right thing - and remember, we have doubled the operational allowance so that people serving out here in Afghanistan get that extra £5,000. 'Using the money that way, rather than having a blanket pay increase where a lot of the extra money would go to pay generals and colonels and the rest of it, is I think the right thing to do.' The report records improvements to operational allowances, leave arrangements, mental healthcare provision and support for forces children's education over the past year. But Shadow Health Secretary Jim Murphy said: 'Our forces will judge ministers on actions, not warm words.' Speaking about the dust storm, he said there was 'no point whingeing about it' and he had been able to meet service personnel he would not usually see . Among the troops he met General James Huggins, head of Isaf Regional Command South, for talks on military progress in Afghanistan . The Prime Minister indicated that he was planning further withdrawals of troops in 2013 after the 500 due to be pulled out next year. He again refused to give an exact timescale for how Britain’s deployment would be withdrawn ahead of his deadline for all combat troops to be out by the end of 2014. But he told reporters: 'I don’t want to see some massive cliff-edge in 2014 - I don’t think that’s practical. 'But I don’t think we need to make hard and fast decisions at this stage.' He said there was 'an ongoing conversation with our allies' about how and when Nato forces would be withdrawn over the next three years. 'I’m absolutely clear that the British public deserve to know there is an endpoint to our involvement in Afghanistan and that endpoint is 2014,' he said.

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 11:25 PM on 22nd December 2011 . Cyclist Mark Cavendish tonight capped a remarkable year when he was crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year. The 26-year-old, who was world race champion and winner of five stages at this year's Tour de France, saw off competition from distance runner Mo Farah and golfer Darren Clarke to land the top prize at the glitzy BBC ceremony in Salford. Cavendish had long been the odds on favourite to scoop Sports Personality of the Year 2011 following an extraordinary 12 months. Landmark: Mark Cavendish hailed the award as 'an honour' before paying tribute to the other nominees and his pregnant girlfriend . Personal triumph: Bookies' favourite Cavendish won this year after previously winning four stages of the Tour de France in 2008 but not even getting nominated . Top three: Cavendish, centre, Clarke, left, and Farah, right, pose with their trophies after securing the top positions at the awards bash . Podium places: Golder Darren Clarke came in second at the glitzy BBC award ceremony in Salford, while distance runner Mo Farah, pictured with his wife Tania and daughter Rihanna, came third . The Isle of Man rider achieved the two huge goals he set for himself in 2011, becoming the first Briton to win the green jersey in the Tour de France and then clinching gold in the road race at the World Championships. A tearful Cavendish, who joins Tommy Simpson and Sir Chris Hoy as cycling's winners of the award, said: 'I'm absolutely speechless. 'A few of my team-mates here will say that's a rare thing. Without those guys this wouldn't even be close to possible. 'I had a group of guys in (the World Championships in) Copenhagen who rode incredible and that brought a rainbow jersey back to Britain after more than half a decade, and that's a massive thing.' Cavendish, whose girlfriend Peta Todd is expecting their first child next year, has established himself as one of the best sprinters in the history of cycling and this year took his tally of Tour de France stage wins to 20. He went on to describe the award was 'an honour', as he accepted the trophy in front of an audience of sporting celebrities, as well as his pregnant girlfriend Peta. The award will be a personal triumph for Cavendish, who despite winning four stages of the Tour de France in 2008 and six in 2009, has yet to land one of the most prestigious prizes in British sport. After winning four stages in 2008 he was not even nominated, and described the four seconds air time he got from host Sue Barker that year as 'four daggers through my heart'. But the cycling star was not to be denied in 2011 and scooped the prize ahead of Darren Clarke in second and Mo Farah in third. Veteran Clarke was an emotional and surprise winner of the Open Championship this summer, five years after his wife Heather died of breast cancer. Farah starred at the athletics World Championships in Daegu, South Korea, becoming the first British athlete to win the 5,000 metres title and also taking silver in the 10,000m. After receiving the award, Cavendish said: 'I would like to thanks everyone who . supported me, my girlfriend Peta and her little bump, and obviously well . done to all the other people who were nominated. Hero Olympian Sir Steve Redgrave was given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the BBC ceremony . Icing on the cake: Andrew Strauss, left, accepts the Team of the Year gong on behalf of the England cricket side, who this year won the Ashes in Australia and became the world's top test side . 'Nervous': He may have turned up knowing he was the favourite to walk away with the Sports Personality of the Year Award, but cyclist Mark Cavendish still looked nervous when he arrived at the Salford ceremony . Boxer Amir Kahn, left, dressed to impress in a black suit and tie, while golfer Luke Donald also looked sharp . 'In an incredible year for British sport....where we can produce champions from such a small place, and to be yo against nine inspirational people - I'm lost for words.' 'It's a landmark in cycling.' Elsewhere at the glitzy award ceremony hosted by Gary Lineker and Sue Barker, Coach of the Year award went to England cricket team director Andy Flower, who guided England to a first Ashes win in Australia in more than 20 years. The Zimbabwean, who beat Manchester . United boss Sir Alex Ferguson and Wales rugby coach Warren Gatland to . the award, said: 'This is a very proud moment for me to stand here, . England has been very good to me and my family. Sporting legends: Footballer Michael Owen dressed to impress as he turned up with his wife Louise to the awards show in Salford . 'I'm very proud to be part of the England cricket team. They have done some wonderful things over the last couple of years. 'I think everyone in this room realises it's the players that make the hard decisions, play under pressure and have to deliver. It's great to have a good bunch of players and a good bunch of people to work with.' England's cricket achievements were also honoured with the Team of the Year award, which was collected by captain Andrew Strauss, also a nominee for the individual award. Specs appeal: Golfer Rory McIlroy was named in the final 10 after the best 12 months of his career . Dressing up: Paula Radcliffe and Jane Torvill enjoyed dressing to impress in heels and frocks . Still going strong: Former Personality of the Year, boxer Joe Calzaghe, and his dancer girlfriend Kristina Rihanoff turned up the glamour at the event . He said: 'This is a very special award for a couple of reasons. First there's so many great teams who have won this in the past. 'But also if there's one thing we've all bought into it is the idea the team is more important that the individual. It's the real basis of why we've done well and makes it even more special to win this accolade.' Meanwhile, tennis world number one Novak Djokovic won the Overseas Sports Personality of the Year gong following a year in which he went 41 matches unbeaten and won the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. Steve Redgrave, the former rower and arguably Britain's greatest ever Olympian, was honoured with the lifetime achievement award. Redgrave won his first gold at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, and unforgettably won his fifth in Sydney at the 2000 Olympics. Golfer Lauren Taylor, 17, was named Young Sports Personality of the Year.","Isle of Man cyclist finally lands award after snubs in last three years .

Maya Joseph, 35, was 'instantly cured' of the pain in her legs that had left her unable to walk for a decade after Reverend George Booty placed his hands on her while she prayed to God. She was wheeled into St George’s, an independent Anglican church in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, before walking out unassisted just minutes later. Miracle? Maya Joseph (right) had been unable to walk for ten years before Rev George Booty (left) 'cured' her by touching her legs as she prayed to God . She said: 'I got up and walked and I’ve continued to walk ever since. I feel fantastic. I was healed.' Ms Joseph, who has dwarfism and is registered blind, has been unable to walk since she was 25 due to curvature of the spine. But despite doctors saying she would probably never walk again, she can now stroll to the local shops and hop on a bus to get around her hometown of Luton. Ms Joseph, who is 4ft 7in tall, said her leg was twisted but has now started to straighten since the 'healing service' in early October. She said: 'I did believe it would happen . one day. 'I was sat at the altar in the church and he laid hands on me, . prayed, and said lift up your legs - and I could. 'He wasn’t expecting it and I certainly wasn’t. I just said: ""Thank you, wow, that’s amazing."" 'I went into the service with real pain but . walked out with none. My body has just got stronger and stronger since . then. 'I’m going for walks every day and . feeling fitter than I have done for years. My doctors are amazed when I . tell them how I was cured.' As she was: Ms Joseph had been confined to her wheelchair for ten years before her miraculous 'cure' in October . Ms Joseph has been a member of St George’s for a year and could previously only attend the church after being lifted into a special minibus to transport her there. Father-of-four Reverend Booty said he was delighted Ms Joseph had been healed, but insisted that God should take the credit. He said: 'I am just a channel through which God is healing. I don’t want to sensationalise it. I just want to carry out whatever work God wants me to do. 'I remember Maya coming forward for prayer for her legs specifically and I laid hands on her in the set Biblical tradition as we prayed. 'I claimed her healing in the name of Jesus and the pain simply left her and she could lift up her legs. Her twisted leg began to slowly straighten over the next few days. 'When we had finished she was really amazing and beaming. She could suddenly lift her legs up and her knees came right up to her chest, without any pain at all.' Reverence Booty is a professional psychotherapist having formerly been a aircraft engine fitter in the RAF, a salesman and debt counsellor before he was 'saved' by Christianity in his early thirties. He claims that since he was ordained in 2003, two other people have reported being cured from their illnesses. The reverend said: 'A churchgoer with bowel cancer said she recovered after she attended one of my services and another said their years of back pain had completely gone. Miracles do happen.' Now Ms Joseph, who has worked as an author and an actress, has one more ambition - to cure her failing eyesight. She is a struggling to raise funds for a pioneering eye operation in the U.S. that costs over £10,000. Meanwhile, she may attend another healing service at St George’s in the hope that it may 'cure' her eyesight.",Maya Joseph claims it took Rev George Booty just minutes to 'cure' her at St George's in Milton Keynes .

"By . Rob Waugh and Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 7:44 AM on 23rd December 2011 . The Atlas detector - one of the LHC's two huge particle detectors - captured a particle that physicists had suspected to exist for years, but had never seen 'in the wild'. The Chi_b (3P) particle was detected among data from the trillions of collisions at the LHC. The discovery was hailed as testimony to how effectively physicists were now scanning the collision data - and essential background to the LHC's ongoing quest for the Higgs, a theoretical particle which is thought to 'explain' why the universe has mass. The Atlas particle detector made the LHC's first confirmed sighting of an entirely new particle earlier this year - a subatomic particle that will help physicists fill in crucial details in their quest for 'new physics' and the Higgs boson . Physicists scan the data from the LHC's detectors for 'unusual' signals from the debris of high-energy collisions. This new particle is an important milestone for the collider - and a crucial step in its mission to fill in the gaps in our understanding of physics. Professor Stefan Soldner-Rembold, a particle physicist at the University of Manchester said the Higgs 'will always be the Nobel Prize', but that this discovery is still very exciting. What's been discovered, he explained, is a particle comprised of a bottom quark and a bottom anti-quark - an entirely new kid on the sub-atomic block that until now was merely a theory. He told MailOnline: 'It's exciting confirmation of the theory of strong interactions that keeps these particles together, the same theory that describes how a nucleus sticks together. 'What they've found is a b-quark and an anti b-quark. 'Quarks cannot be seen by themselves, they're contained in a particle and held together with the strong force. If you understand how the force works, you can predict which particles should exist. 'With all these different quarks you can play Lego and put them together in different ways and form new particles, similar to protons, that can be combined to form elements.' The Hadron Collider: The machine hurls particles at one another at enormous energies to see what odd particles emerge from the 'debris' - but this is the first time it has detected an all-new particle . The results were put online on the scientific publication site ArXiv. The find is an important step for the LHC - which is more than a machine built solely to hunt for the Higgs boson. Finding particles such as Chi_b (3P) is crucial to filling in the gaps in the Standard Model - the way we understand physics. The LHC was designed to fill in these gaps - and help physicists 'move on' to the Higgs and 'new physics'.","First confirmed find at the LHC since it opened in 2009 .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 4:58 PM on 22nd December 2011 . The owner of British Airways today agreed to buy rival airline BMI in a deal which rivals claim will mean higher prices for flyers. The deal will give BA owners International Airlines Group (IAG) more than half of the take-off and landing slots at Heathrow. Virgin Atlantic said the airline would be able to use their 'monopoly power' to force up fares if the £172.5million takeover is completed. Buyout: British Airways' owner has agreed a deal to buy BMI which Virgin claim will mean higher prices for flyers . Dominance: British Airways' owners will have 53 per cent of take off and landing slots at Heathrow if they take over BMI . Sir Richard Branson today vowed to fight to get the authorities to block the deal. It will give IAG, who also own Spanish carrier Iberia, an extra 56 slots at Heathrow. Buyout: International Airlines Group chief executive Willie Walsh warned there will be job losses at BMI . The deal will leave them with 53 per cent of the spaces at Heathrow - which compares with Lufthansa's 66 per cent hold . at Frankfurt airport and Air France KLM's 59 per cent grip at Paris's Charles De . Gaulle airport. BMI, who are currently owned by Lufthansa, are currently loss-making and had been looking for a buyer. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh warned today jobs will have to be cut at the airline who currently employ 3,600 people. However Mr Walsh said the deal was 'good . news for the UK' and said customers would benefit from new destinations . and more convenient schedules. He said IAG would use its increased number of slots to launch new long-haul routes but would maintain the domestic network. They hope to complete the purchase in the first three months of next year. Lufthansa has the right to sell two offshoots from BMI separately - BMI regional and BMI baby - before the deal is completed. Virgin, who had been negotiating to buy the stricken airline themselves, today vowed to fight the deal. Dominance: Deal will give British Airways' owners a 53 per cent share of the take-off and landing slots at Heathrow. Pictured is Terminal Five at the airport, which is used exclusively by BA . Sir Richard, the Virgin president, added: 'Claiming that this deal is about new markets from Heathrow is a smoke-screen. 'This deal simply cuts consumer choice and screws the travelling public. Monopoly claims: Richard Branson claimed today that the takeover would mean higher prices for consumers . 'BA is already dominant at Heathrow . and their removal of BMI just tightens their stranglehold at the world's . busiest international airport. 'We will fight this monopoly every . step of the way as we think it is bad for the consumer, bad for the . industry and bad for Britain.' A spokesman for Virgin added that they would be fighting to block the deal. 'If the acquisition is completed, it . will tilt the competitive landscape dangerously towards BA and cast a . shadow over the British travelling public,' he said. 'We will be asking the competition . authorities to stop this deal and to protect the many millions of . passengers on routes where BA and BMI currently compete. 'With Heathrow sewn up, BA can use its monopoly power to force up prices at the expense of the consumer.' BMI, who fly to Europe, the Middle East and Africa as well as destinations within the UK, made a £153million pre-tax loss in the 12 months ending in April 2010. Mr Walsh said that they may keep the BMI name - or they may re-brand all the planes with British Airways livery. A spokesman for the Unite union said: 'We will be looking to meet with IAG in the immediate future to press for guarantees on jobs and terms.' BMI was staring financial oblivion in the face before a deal was agreed today for them to be sold off to British Airways' owners. BMI was founded over 70 years ago as Air Schools, specialising in RAF pilot training before the war in 1938. The company celebrated a landmark in 1979 when it carried over one million passengers in a single year. As the airline industry expanded rapidly, their customer numbers grew to 6.5million by the end of the 1990s. They now operate almost 2,000 commercial flights per week. In 2002, the airline launched the budget subsidiary BMI Baby and in 2007 it introduced numerous mid-haul flights to the Middle East and Russia. It has a total of 60 aircraft serving three divisions, BMI Mainline - the unit BA is most interested in - BMI Regional and BMI Baby.","Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson warns flyers face higher prices if deal goes through .

TV funnyman Justin Lee Collins has been accused of harassing his ex-girlfriend over a six-month period. Collins denies the alleged harassment and entered a plea of not guilty when he appeared at St Albans Magistrates' Court today. He will now face a jury trial over the allegations after asking to be tried at a Crown Court. Accused: Justin Lee Collins attended St Albans Magistrates' Court today after being charged with harassing an ex-girlfriend . The shaggy-haired comedian, 37, is accused of causing Anna Larke 'fear of violence' when the pair dated between January and July this year. If convicted the presenter, who is currently appearing in West End show Rock of Ages, could face up to six months behind bars. When asked if he wanted his case to be heard by magistrates or at a Crown Court, he politely replied, 'Crown Court please.' This means that a judge and jury will decide the outcome of the case. He will now attend a further pre-trial hearing at the magistrates' court on 17 February 2012, when he will be given a date to appear at a Crown Court. Happier times: The comedian and then-girlfriend Anna Larke laze on the beach during a romantic holiday to Miami in February this year . The Bristolian comic arrived at court wearing jeans and trainers with a checked shirt and tie. He was not required to stand in the dock, and instead stood next to his solicitor during the brief hearing in Hertfordshire. Reading out the charge against him, . chair of the magistrates' bench, Doreen Clapper, said: 'It is alleged . that between January 2011 and July 2011 you caused Anna Larke to fear . that violence would be used against her by your course of action which . you knew or ought to have known would cause fear of violence to her on . each occasion that you made threats of violence towards her.'

There have been more than 70 arrests at the anti-capitalist camp in just two months after a spate of alcohol-fuelled fights between demonstrators that has left many women activists scared to stay on the site.

A real-life Billy Elliot who feared he was paralysed in an alleged street attack today said he WILL dance again after making a miraculous recovery in time for Christmas. Professional ballet star Jack Widdowson, 19, suffered serious spinal injuries as he walked home from a night out last month. His family rushed to his bedside and doctors feared he would be never be able to dance again after the incident in Cardiff, south Wales. Focussed: Jack Widdowson (left) at home with his family this Christmas after recovering sufficiently from an alleged attack which nearly left him paralysed. He is pictured with (left to right) his father Julian, mother Celia and older brother Mark . But the determined teen has defied medical expectations and is now back home with his family - even managing to walk short distances unaided. He now hopes to get back dancing and resume his apprenticeship with the prestigious Bern:Ballett company in Switzerland. His family claim it was the ballet training that saved Jack’s life by enabling him to recover so quickly. Jack said: 'Ballet is my passion and this incident has made me realise that now more than ever. I don’t want this injury to define me or my career. 'With long and difficult hydrotherapy and physiotherapy sessions, I keep focussed on the end goal, which is to dance again and hopefully continue my apprenticeship. 'The support that I have . received from family, friends, colleagues and tutors both in the UK and . Switzerland has been overwhelming and their messages really helped. 'Especially . in those first few weeks when it was taking an enormous amount of . effort and concentration just to re-learn how to do everyday activities . such as holding a cup on my own and playing hangman with family . members.' Rising star: Jack in his days as a member of the Bern: Ballet company Switzerland. He is determined to return to his apprenticeship before too long . Jack’s family, including parents Julian and Celia, two brothers George and Mark and sister Chloe, held a bedside vigil after the attack in Cardiff on November 5. The stage star, from Farmborough, north east Somerset, was walking home from a night out in the city and had become separated from his friends when the incident happened on a canal path. He was found by fellow revellers an hour later and taken to the University Hospital of Wales - but has now been discharged earlier than expected. His dad Dr Julian Widdowson, 52, head of sports medicine at Bath Rugby and CircleBath Hospital, said he could not believe how much progress he had made. He said: 'It feels like an absolute miracle. 'When Jack first regained consciousness we were unsure of the extent of the long-term damage and feared that he may have been paralysed from the neck down. 'However, by some stroke of fate this was not the case and a number of small, positive signs gave us hope. 'Up until a week ago we didn’t really expect to have a Christmas this year, however, now that Jack is back home and showing such strong signs of recovery we really do feel it is an occasion to celebrate.'","Ballet star Jack Widdowson suffered serious spinal injuries .

Callous raiders have shown little regard for the sacrosanct; striking churches in a Lancashire town in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Smashing stained glass windows for entry, the thieves have attacked eight churches near Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire in the last few weeks. In their raids, among valuables, they have impiously helped themselves to collection money and even bottles of communion wine. Police with Rev John Holland at Immanuel And All Saints Church in Oswaldtwistle. Raided twice, the church is among seven in the area broken into and targeted in the lead up to Christmas . Now, police are ordering vicars to make sure no items of value are left in the churches over the festive season. Officers have visited every church in the area to offer crime prevention advice. Police said hundreds of pounds worth of tools, computers and other items have also been stolen. Eight incidents reported to police, seven of which have been at churches in the Oswaldtwistle area. Rev John Holland, said: 'It’s very demoralising for people . who are trying to do good things in the community to be battered like . this by people who break in for the fun of it or a bit of communion . wine. Immanuel Parish Church in New Lane was targeted twice and has been left with a £900 repair bill. Raiders smashed stained glass windows and stole communion wine and chocolates . Coun Peter Britcliffe, who represents Oswaldtwistle on both Hyndburn and Lancashire County Councils said: ‘It’s disgraceful that not even churches are not sacred any more. Rev John Holland says the break-ins are 'demoralising' when the church is trying to do good in the community . ‘Traditionally churches are filled with beautiful ornaments and collections for the poor and those things should be safe from thieves. ‘It is just so very sad that these things are happening at this time of year when we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.’ Rev John Holland, said: ‘I’m very disappointed that people are targeting churches. ‘We don’t need the hassle of having to deal with repairs. The amount of damage these people are causing when they break in is sometimes worse than what they are taking. ‘We had a break-in earlier in the year in the daytime, when they broke a pane of glass because they could see an organ pipe used to collect money. ‘We now have to keep the building locked - even in daylight hours.’ PC Louise Jacks said she believed criminals were targeting churches as the buildings were often empty and unattended at night. She said: ‘Some of the criminal fraternity have some morals but when people break into a church they are crossing the line.’ PCSO James Gorrie said officers had reminded those in charge of churches to make sure their alarms and security lights were working.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 11:41 AM on 23rd December 2011 . Portugal's Supreme Court has refused a request to extradite convicted killer and fugitive George Wright back to the U.S., his lawyer said Thursday. Wright's lawyer Manuel Luis Ferreira said the court rejected an appeal by the U.S. against a lower court's decision that denied extradition a month ago. Mr Ferreira said: 'The Supreme Court has denied the appeal. They notified me today.' Staying put: George Wright will not be extradited back to the U.S., where he killed a man and later broke out of jail before hijacking a plane and going on the run . The U.S. can now appeal to Portugal's Constitutional Court if it wants to. Mr Ferreira said he did not have details of the ruling. In Portugal, extradition cases are conducted in secret. Mr Ferreira said Wright intends to remain in Portugal. A Lisbon judge decided against Wright's extradition in November, two months after he was captured in Portugal following four decades on the run. The U.S. Justice Department filed an appeal less than two weeks later. Supreme Court officials weren't available to comment after office hours Thursday, and the U.S. Justice Department did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment. Mr Ferreira said the lower court judge had ruled that Wright, 68, had become a Portuguese citizen and the statute of limitations on his 15- to 30-year sentence for a New Jersey robbery-murder had expired. Family man: Fugitive George Wright looks at his wife Maria do Rosario Valente in their kitchen at home in Almocageme, near Lisbon, where he has lived since 1993 . Wright, now called Jorge Luis dos Santos after changing his identity, is married to a Portuguese woman and has two grown children. They have lived near Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, since 1993. Wright was accused gunning down Walter Patterson during a 1962 gas station robbery in the U.S. Patterson's daughter was stunned by the Lisbon court ruling. Ann Patterson, who is 63, said: 'I'm surprised. I wouldn't know what else to say about it.' Wright spent seven years in a U.S. prison for murder before breaking out in 1970. He and others then hijacked a plane in 1972 from the U.S. to Algeria along with other Black Liberation Army militants. As he was: Wright has been on the run since 1970. His wife (right) claims her husband regrets his criminal past . He was captured in Portugal after his U.S. fingerprint matched one in Portugal's database of prints for all citizens. Wright's fugitive odyssey began when he busted out of Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, New Jersey, on Aug. 19, 1970, and made his way to Detroit, where he joined the Black Liberation Army. Dressed as a priest, he hijacked a Delta flight to Miami with four others, using handguns they sneaked on the plane. After releasing the plane's 86 passengers for $1 million, the hijackers forced the plane to fly to Boston, then to Algeria, where they sought asylum. Algeria gave the money and plane back to the U.S., and Wright and his comrades went underground, settling in France. The others were captured and convicted of hijacking in Paris, but radical French sympathizers helped Wright escape to Portugal. Hideout: The house where Wright has lived for more than 20 years . Wright met his future wife, Maria do Rosario Valente, in Lisbon in 1978. The couple moved in the early 1980s to Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony, where Wright lived openly using his real name and socialized with U.S. diplomats and embassy personnel who told The Associated Press they were unaware of his past. Guinea-Bissau granted him political asylum in the 1980s, made him a citizen and gave him the new name Jose Luis Jorge dos Santos, complete with fake names for his parents. Wright then got Portuguese citizenship through his 1991 marriage to a Portuguese woman. His identity from Guinea-Bissau was accepted by Portugal when it granted him citizenship, according to his lawyer. He and his wife moved back to Portugal in 1993 to the tiny town of Almocageme, 28 miles (45 kilometers) from Lisbon. Hijack: Dressed as a priest, Wright hijacked a plane bound for Detroit in 1972. FBI agents tried to negotiate with them before they escaped to Algeria with a $1million ransom . Wright then worked a series of jobs - as a painter, a nightclub bouncer and a barbecue chicken restaurant manager - as they raised two children. Wright's wife Maria do Rosario Valente argued in October that her husband suffers from various health problems and should not be extradited from Portugal to the U.S. Ms Valente said he suffers from glaucoma, 'very, very high' blood pressure caused by recent stress, and has complained of chest pains. She claims her husband, who she has . lived with for 20 years, regrets his criminal past and has become a . more peaceful man since his days in the Black Liberation Army.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:07 PM on 23rd December 2011 . Nightmares of snowstorms and flight cancellations are more common than visions of sugarplums around this time of year. But luckily the weather seems to be helping the millions of holiday travellers by causing few delays as people head out to visit family over Christmas weekend. As of Thursday evening, there was nothing to indicate any widespread weather disruptions at the beginning of the Christmas travel period. Little to fear: While there may be some snow-related problems in New Mexico and Western Texas, the only other area is between Boston and New York where wind and fog may be an issue . Winter wonderland: Snow in Colorado isn't causing problems for travellers, but is a nice backdrop for a white Christmas . Weather.com only listed Boston, New York, and Albuquerque as potentially risky airports, and even those weather warnings were limited to low clouds, rain, light snow and wind. Road travel warnings are listed in Massachusetts, the Upper Hudson Valley of New York, the I-25 spanning from Wyoming to New Mexico, and the Texas panhandle. Heavy snow did force the cancellation of more than 100 flights Thursday at Denver International Airport, one of the nation's busiest, but that tapered off by Thursday evening. Keep an eye out: Limited snow (white), wind (purple) and floods (light blue) are the only problems . Severe thunderstorms are forecast today in the southeast part of the country, while snow falls in the mountains of New England. Mountainous areas of New York state and New England were expected to get several inches of snow by Friday morning, and rain and thunderstorms were forecast down the coast to the Carolinas. These unexpectedly pleasant weather warnings come a year after much of the East Coast was completely shut down from a massive pre-Christmas snowstorm. Talk about changing times: The holidays last year (shown left in D.C.) were filled with snow as compared to this year (right, Minnesota) where much of the country is left brown and dry . The relatively-sunny outlook is good news as more Americans are expected to take long trips this holiday season. About 92 million people will travel 50 miles or more from Friday through Jan. 2, an increase of 1.4 per cent more than last year, according to AAA. Hit the skies: Up to 92 million- more people than ever- are scheduled to travel by air this holiday season . The federation of motor clubs said 90 percent will travel by car. Drivers will find gasoline prices higher than last year, but well below this year's peaks. Air travel will be down about 10 per cent. Airlines have trimmed the number of flights and are packing planes fuller than ever before. That means if something goes wrong, there are fewer options to rebook stranded passengers. There are just no spare seats. Bad weather also can mean more cancellations than in the past. A Department of Transportation rule that went into effect in April 2010 limits planes to three hours on the tarmac. Airlines that violate it face penalties of up to $27,500 per person — that's more than $3.7million for just one Boeing 737. That has made them skittish about operating in bad weather, leading to 20 per cent more cancellations in the typical month. Taking flight: One little traveller at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport was probably excited at the lack of delays .","Few travel warnings as skies expected to be clear over holiday weekend .

"By . Charles Walford . Last updated at 2:36 PM on 23rd December 2011 . Goalmouth to gantry: Collymore in his role as a pundit for talkSPORT . Stan Collymore has demanded action from Twitter after a user said he should ‘go hang himself like Gary Speed’. As the row over racism in football rumbled on, the abusive Tweet finished with ‘ok negrito’ – a reference to Luis Suarez’s comment to Patrice Evra. The Liverpool player was banned for eight games and fined £40,000 after using words that ‘included a reference to Mr Evra’s colour'. The news that John Terry is to be charged with racially abusing Anton Ferdinand during a match, and a storm of anger over Alan Hansen's reference to 'coloured' players has only served to bring the issue of racism in football to the fore in recent weeks. The racist abuse Collymore has been subjected to began in the wake of his comments on the Hansen incident, in which he tried to highlight the problem of racism in football. Collymore, who won three England caps and is now a talkSPORT pundit, also linked to a number of other posts apparently voicing support for Suarez using highly offensive racist language. Collymore’s online argument started after he was quoted in response to Alan Hansen’s remarks on Match of the Day on Saturday. He highlighted his links to racist comments, saying ‘you tell me there’s nothing to address’. A poster called Jon Juwanson then tweeted ‘@StanCollymore do us a favour Stan and go and hang yourself like Gary Speed did please. Ok Negrito’. Also mocking the former player's admission that he suffered from depression. He then continued to abuse Collymore before his misspelled defence of ‘Woy um I racest. Negrito meens pal.’ Alan Hansen was forced to issue an apology after being dragged into the racism row by . referring to black players as ‘coloured’. In . a discussion of the controversies surrounding England captain Terry and Liverpool striker Suarez, Hansen used the word as he . praised the achievements of black players in the Premier League. But . many viewers objected to the term – considered offensive because it . dismisses everyone who is not white as the same – and the Corporation . yesterday received more than 100 complaints. As Collymore tried to address the serious issue of racism in football, users began their sick mocking . Others . were quick to defend the former Scotland international, however, with . Twitter users and former MP Ann Widdecombe describing the outrage at . Hansen’s comment as an overreaction. Hansen, . who is thought to earn about £40,000 a show, used the term ‘coloured’ twice on Wednesday night’s edition of the BBC1 programme as he and . fellow pundit Lee Dixon talked about racism in football. The . discussion happened on the day it was revealed Terry will face a . criminal charge over allegedly using racist language on the pitch. The . 56-year-old said: ‘I think there’s a lot of coloured players in all the . major teams and there are lots of coloured players who are probably the . best in the Premier League. ‘If . you look at 25 or 30 years ago it was probably in a bad way – not as . bad as some of the other nations on the Continent – but certainly there . is always, always room for improvement.’ Confrontation: Chelsea captain Terry allegedly called QPR's Anton Ferdinand s 'f****** black ****' during a match . Punished: Liverpool player Luis Suarez has been handed an eight-match ban by the Football Association for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra . After . the row over his comments blew up, Hansen said in a . statement: ‘I unreservedly apologise for any offence caused. ‘This was never my intention  and I deeply regret the use of  the word.’ A senior BBC sport insider said . the pundit was ‘mortified’ about the comments, which came after a . ‘really long’ and ‘challenging’ day in the studio. They . suggested that the heightened ‘sensitivity’ around descriptions of race . on the football field may have led him to resort to a word he does not . usually use. ‘He is not a racist at all, in any sense,’ they added. But . ex-Premier League footballer Darren Huckerby tweeted: ‘Does anybody . think that people are just jumping on the bandwagon about the Alan . Hansen comment?’ Another observer wrote: ‘Massive overreaction about Alan Hansen calling black players “coloured”! He’s just old school.’ And . another added: ‘Got to feel for Alan Hansen. Praising black PL players . and condemning racism in football only for some idiots to take offence – . ridiculous.’ Controversy: BBC pundit Alan Hansen, left, came under fire for using the word 'coloured' on Match of the Day, and appeared to anger fellow commentator Lee Dixon, right . England captain Terry was told this week that he must appear in court next year to answer a criminal charge of using racist language on the field. To the fury of anti-racism campaigners, top officials at the Football Association stayed silent after the footballer was formally summonsed yesterday over an outburst against a black player during a Premier League clash. The multi-millionaire defender – who denies any racial abuse – also continued to enjoy the backing of his club, Chelsea. He is accused of calling Ferdinand a ‘f****** black ****’ during the match at QPR’s Loftus Road stadium. But afterwards he told Ferdinand, whose brother Rio plays alongside Terry for England, that the remarks had been taken out of context, insisting he actually said: ‘Oi, Anton, do you think I called you a  black ****?’ Terry will first appear in court next February but the case is likely to drag on for up to six months as lawyers prepare for a trial. The maximum punishment Terry faces is a £2,500 fine, a sum he earns in just two hours and 38 minutes on his £160,000-a-week salary. Last night, Terry, 31, said he was ‘disappointed’ with the decision and that he hoped to clear his name ‘as quickly as possible’. He said: ‘I have never aimed a racist remark at anyone and count people from all races and creeds among my closest friends.’",Football pundit was trying to highlight issue of racism in the sport in wake of John Terry and Luis Suarez incidents .

Exams will be toughened in the wake of the scandal over teachers being ‘coached’ by examiners in how to improve marks, Michael Gove has warned. The Education Secretary said he was concerned that teachers and pupils had ‘too much certainty over which elements of the curriculum will be tested’.

It will be sat at a later date. Earlier this month, it was claimed that teachers were paying up to £230 a . day to attend seminars with chief examiners, during which they were advised on questions and wording pupils should use to get higher marks. Mr Gove has said that 'larger-scale reform' of exams may be necessary in the future . Three examiners, from WJEC, the Welsh exam board, and Edexcel were suspended. Yesterday Mr Gove warned that ‘larger-scale reform’ of exams might now be necessary. He expressed concern some had argued coaching was ‘within the letter’ of exam rules. He said: ‘Providing teachers and students with too much certainty over which elements of the curriculum will be tested, or which questions will be asked, only serves to narrow the curriculum, lower standards and promote teaching to the test. ‘I was therefore pleased to see that you will be reviewing what role seminars should play in our qualification system in future. ‘In addition, it will be important to look at the exam rules in the short term to ensure they are consistently applied and properly limit the information that can be given out. ‘In the longer term, as we redevelop requirements for A-levels and GCSEs, I shall seek to ensure there is sufficient 'unpredictability' and rigour in those specifications to underpin public confidence that exams are true tests of ability across a suitably broad and challenging syllabus. ‘I do not rule out that a larger-scale reform might be necessary.’ Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg called for ‘a level playing field’ 'We're cheating': Examiner Paul Evans was caught on film giving teachers a sneak peek at what topics would come up in exams .","Ofqual ordered ICT paper to be withdrawn to protect the ‘integrity and security’ of the qualification .

Palace officials were approached by officers within recent days and told the royal couple may have been targeted by Glenn Mulcaire. The names of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are believed to have been included in an 11,000-page dossier kept by Mulcaire which was seized by Scotland Yard in 2006. The Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall during their visit to a health centre in Devon today. The names of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are believed to have been included in an 11,000-page dossier kept by Mulcaire which was seized by Scotland Yard in 2006. The document, which is at the centre of the hacking scandal, names 4,000 people believed to be victims. The new royal revelations came on a day in which a raft of accusations ensured that the scandal was deepening, rather than going away, as Rupert Murdoch would have hoped following the closure of NotW. Gordon Brown is expected to wade into the row and allege that Murdoch's empire targeted his personal information and accessed his son's medical records, according to The Guardian. An investigation discovered that a 'blagger' - thought to be a private detective - had posed as Mr Brown and gained bank details on behalf of the Sunday Times. Charles and Camilla join at least eight other members of the royal household thought to have had their voicemail messages intercepted. A Buckingham Palace source today told the Guardian: 'The question that has to be answered is, if somebody had access to this evidence back then, why didn't they do something about it?' Scotland Yard made the revelations about Charles and Camilla in response to a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian. Hacking row: Jeremy Hunt, left, told the House of Commons today he was referring News Corporation's bid to buy the remainder of shares in BSkyB to the Competition Commission. It also emerged that Glenn Mulcaire, right may have targeted Prince Charles and Camilla while phone hacking at the NotW . In 2007, the News of the World's former royal reporter Clive Goodman and private detective Glenn Mulcaire were jailed for intercepting messages from members of the royal household. The revelation comes on the day that it emerged that the News of the World paid Royal Protection Officers for personal details about the Queen and other senior royals. Detectives are investigating claims that sums of around £1,000 were offered to officers tasked with protecting the royals. An email showed former royal editor Clive Goodman asked the paper's editor at the time Andy Coulson for cash to buy a confidential directory of royal phone numbers. Goodman, 53, and Coulson, 43, have been arrested and bailed until October on suspicion of bribing police officers. Princes William and Harry have also apparently been hacked by the News of the World, it has previously been revealed. A minor story in the Sunday paper created the hacking storm when Clive Goodman wrote that William had damaged a tendon playing football. Palace officials were baffled by how the story got out because so few people knew about it. Today Rupert Murdoch's attempt to takeover BSkyB was tonight referred to the Competition Commission. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the House of Commons that the Commission would be able to consider 'all relevant recent developments' when it came to evaluating the proposed merger. Mr Hunt told MPs he hoped the law 'shows no mercy' to those involved in phone hacking, including 'any managers who condoned such appalling behaviour'.","Charles and Camilla's names found in Mulcaire dossier .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:23 AM on 15th July 2011 . Ground zero: News of the World reporters allegedly tried to hack phones of 9/11 victims . News of the World reporters tried to hack the voicemails of dead 9/11 victims, a former New York policeman claimed last night. He alleged he was contacted by News of the World journalists who said they would pay him to retrieve the private phone records of the dead. The former cop, who now works as a private investigator, said that reporters wanted British victim’s mobile numbers and details of calls in the days surrounding  the tragedy. The voicemails are likely to have included harrowing messages from distraught relatives desperately trying to contact their loved ones in the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York in 2001. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'This investigator is used by a lot of journalists in America and he recently told me that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims’ private phone data. 'He said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their ­relatives. 'His presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the ­relevant voicemails, just like it has been shown they have done in the UK. The PI said he had to turn the job down. He knew how insensitive such research would be, and how bad it would look.' The source said that the ­journalists were interested in getting the phone records belonging to the British victims of the attacks. Under American law, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) makes it a crime for American companies to offer corrupt payments to foreign government officials. If the allegations of payments to police officers are proven, Mr Murdoch could face an American prosecution in his role as deputy chief operating officer the US-listed News Corp. A former New York police officer has also claimed that News of the World journalists tried to pay him for phone details of British 9/11 victims . Capitalising on grief: Reporters were allegedly tried to get hold frantic calls as the tragedy unfolded . In 2009, the former Hollywood producer Gerald Green was jailed for six months after being prosecuted under the FCPA for making $1.8m (£1.1m) in bribes to a Thai government official. Butler University law professor Mike Koehler, an FCPA expert, said: 'I would be very surprised if the U.S. authorities don't become . involved in this News International conduct.' He said the FCPA could be invoked because News Corp is an American company and . because the alleged payments would have been made in order for the newspaper . to make money from the stories obtained. Brett Pulley, media correspondent for the Bloomberg news agency in New York, . said: 'If the fall out were to continue, my goodness, if it were to impact . James Murdoch, then we start to talk about it impacting News Corp’s succession plan, . so that affects the company globally.' Paul Farhi, media correspondent for The Washington Post, added: 'There’s a . whole domino effect. What else falls apart? Do bankers get nervous? 'Rupert Murdoch had one flirtation with bankruptcy in the early 90s. He’s . very dependent on the goodwill of Wall Street and of bankers. “His company is very profitable now — it’s not quite the same as the 1990s — . but he doesn’t want these dominoes to keep toppling … . 'The fact he shut down a newspaper reflects how seriously the scandal is . affecting a whole empire.' In Slate.com, noted commentator Jack Shafer wrote: 'Like all reverse-ferret manoeuvres, the closing of News of the World is designed to scatter and confuse the audience. It looks like the sacrifice of something very special to him, seeing as it was his first U.K. newspaper acquisition in 1968. But it's not. 'It looks like atonement, but it's not. It's supposed to change the subject, but it's too late for that. 'The most shocking thing to me about the paper's closure is what an empty gesture it is. 'I expected much better from the genocidal tyrant. 'The tricky thing about the reverse ferret is that unless you nab the beast the moment it bursts out of a pant leg, it can be impossible to apprehend. 'From the way News Corp. is acting, it looks to me as if the Murdochs have lost control of their precious ferret. If I were Rupert Murdoch, I'd start wearing my socks over my cuffs. Ferrets will eat anything that looks and smells like meat.' The claims came as the disgraced paper's owner Rupert Murdoch flew into London to take personal charge of the phone-hacking scandal. He first stopped at News International's headquarters in Wapping, East London, where he arrived in a red Range Rover, a copy of the last edition of the News of the World in his hands. Protective: Rupert Murdoch guides Rebekah Brooks away from the media as they leave his London flat . Family affairs: James Murdoch leaves his father's Mayfair apartment yesterday. He later joined Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks at the Stafford Hotel where they were expected to dine together . Later yesterday he put on an extraordinary show of support for Rebekah Brooks - apparently unconcerned about her imminent interview under police caution. Mrs Brooks, who has twice offered to resign over the controversy, was seen entering Mr Murdoch's Mayfair apartment at around 5.30pm yesterday. Later, when asked what was his top priority, the 80-year-old media mogul gestured to Mrs Brooks. 'She is,' he replied. The pair spent an hour in the apartment on the day the final edition of the News of the World hit news stands. Then, in front of hordes of photographers, Mr Murdoch walked Mrs Brooks out of the block of flats with his arm firmly around her. Last hurrah: Editor of the News of the World, Colin Myler, poses with staff outside the newspaper offices for the last time . They had beaming smiles as they crossed the road to the Stafford Hotel, where they were expected to dine together. They were later joined by Mr Murdoch’s son, James, the chairman of News International. Pictures of the 'Rupert and Rebekah show' will infuriate the victims of phone hacking and those who question her denials. The phone hacking row erupted last week when fresh allegations emerged that News or the World journalists paid private investigators to hack into the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. They are also alleged to have listened in on voice messages from the family of Soham victims Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. Hordes of advertisers finally abandoned the 'toxic' paper, forcing it to close, when it was revealed that they may have hacked into the phones of war dead. Alleged victims: The families of murdered schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman are claimed to have had their phone hacked alongside Milly Dowler when she was missing . A string of the paper's senior executives, including Mrs Brooks, face being quizzed as potential suspects or witnesses over their roles in the phone-hacking scandal which brought down the 168-year-old title she once edited. Mrs Brooks is set to be questioned under caution in London in the next two weeks. She will be asked to give a full account of her actions during the period from 2000 to 2003 when she was editor. It has also been revealed that at least nine former News of the World journalists, and three police officers, face charges over the hacking and corruption scandal. Meanwhile, a 63-year-old man arrested on Friday has been bailed. Officers would not confirm reports he is a private investigator . The scandal has threatened Murdoch's controversial bid to take full control of BSkyB. Labour leader Ed Miliband plans to attempt to force through a Commons vote this week that could see the deal postponed until after the police investigation into phone hacking is complete. M<r Miliband said yesterday: 'The idea that this organisation, which has engaged in these terrible ­practices, should be allowed to take over BSkyB... without that criminal investigation having been completed, and on the basis of assurances from that self-same ­organisation… frankly that won’t wash with the public.'","Murdoch journalists 'wanted phone records of British victims'

But householders in one part of the country have been hit with winter drought restrictions – warning them not to run baths or wash their cars over Christmas. South East Water told residents of 65,000 homes in Sussex to take short showers instead of baths and to use washing machines and dishwashers only when there is a full load. Christmas drought: South East Water has told residents in Susex not to take baths because Ardingly Reservoir (pictured) needs to be refilled . How it usually looks: Ardingly Reservoir, seven miles south of Crawley, is usually full this time of year . The measures have been introduced to help refill Ardingly Reservoir, seven miles south of Crawley, after water levels dropped to just 12 per cent at the end of November. The water company blamed the problems on unseasonably low rainfall, but admitted it had been made worse by faulty measurements at the reservoir. 'Normally we would expect rainfall in . the early autumn to replenish our reservoirs after the summer, but an . exceptionally dry September, October and November raised the urgency of . the situation,’ a spokesman said. Advice: 65,000 homes have been told to take short showers instead of baths, don't wash cars and ration washing machine and dishwasher use . 'South East Water monitors its reservoir levels, but during its more detailed investigations as part of its drought planning it found the relationship between levels and volume led to an overestimation of the storage available.’ The only time a winter drought order has previously been issued during the winter was in December 2003 in the North West. But this year’s topsy-turvy weather has seen several counties remain in drought for several months after the lowest rainfall on record. The East of England had only half its usual rainfall in September and October, following the driest spring for 80 years. Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire and South Lincolnshire have had their driest year on record. Forceasters say that the unseasonal weather is set to continue – all but killing off hopes of a white Christmas. In . fact, Christmas Day is expected to be wet and warm, with temperatures . hitting 57f (14c), close to the record of 60f (15.6c) set in 1896 near . Edinburgh. Following two snowy, ultra-cold Decembers, the festive season . starts today with temperatures of 54f (12c) in England and Wales, which . will be cloudy with rain moving south. Dry: The East of England had only half its usual rainfall in September and October, following the driest spring for 80 years . Warning: South East Water has told to take short showers instead of baths and to use washing machines and dishwashers only when there is a full load . Tomorrow, Christmas Eve, should be generally fine. The high of 57f on Christmas Day is likely to be reached in Scotland. In England and Wales it will be cloudy, with some drizzle, and temperatures of 55f (13c). There will be similar temperatures on Boxing Day, which will see Scotland and Northern Ireland having more rain, while in England and Wales it will be dry, but cloudy. Rachel Vince, forecaster with MeteoGroup UK, said: 'It’s certainly going to be very mild, although there’s going to be quite a lot of rain in places.’","South East Water issue winter drought restrictions to 65,000 homes in Sussex .

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 4:51 PM on 21st December 2011 . Syrian armed forces have carried out live firing exercises as a show of strength after 111 people were killed in one town yesterday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said troops using heavy machine guns and artillery carried out the killings in the town of Kfar Owaid, in the northwestern province on Idlib. Security forces pursued anti-government activists and army defectors through the town as troops shelled areas where they were thought to be hiding. Show of strength: The Syrian army fired test missiles during a live fire exercise broadcast on state television as it continues to crackdown on its people . Bravado: The display of military manoeuvres was meant to deter international action similar to that which took place to oust Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . The country's main opposition group the Syrian National Council (SNC) said 250 people had been killed in total on Monday and Tuesday in 'bloody massacres', and that the Arab League and United Nations must intervene to protect civilians. It comes as state television showed pictures of military manoeuvres and said they were meant to show Syrian forces were ready to 'repulse any aggression the enemies of our nations might think about'. The 111 people were killed at the same time Syria agreed to allow in foreign monitors under an Arab League plan aimed at stopping bloodshed in the country after weeks of stalling. Around 70 of those shot dead were believed to be army defectors. Critics are deeply sceptical that the agreement to allow the monitors in is anything other than further stalling as international pressure on President Bashar Assad grows. The high toll for two days of violence, among the highest since March, has reinforced that scepticism. Force: Military helicopters take part in the exercise as the contrail of a missile passes them . Force: Surface to air missiles like this were fired in the exercise. The move follows some of the worst bloodshed seen in the nine months of unrest in Syria . The conflict in Syria has become increasingly militarised in recent weeks, with clashes nearly every day between army defectors and troops. Some of the most intense violence has occured in the province of Idlib, with another 70 army defectors killed as they deserted their posts near the Turkish border. The SNC has demanded 'an emergency U.N. Security Council session to discuss the (Assad) regime’s massacres in Jabal al-Zawiyah, Idlib and Homs, in particular' and called for 'safe zones' to be set up under international protection. It also said those regions should be declared disaster areas and urged the International Red Crescent and other relief organisations to provide humanitarian aid. The Arab League plans to call for the removal of troops and heavy weapons from city streets, the start of talks with opposition leaders and allowing human rights workers and journalists into the country. Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby said yesterday that an advance observer team would go to Syria on Thursday to prepare the way for 150 monitors due to arrive by end-December. Mr Assad's regime agreed to allow monitors into the country after Arab leaders warned they would turn to the UN Security Council to try and end a brutal crackdown that is believed to have killed at least 5,000 people since March. Manoeuvres: The Syrian army has been ordered to attack civilians as the brutal regime ignores international calls to end the bloodshed . Defiance: Demonstrators protest against President Bashar al-Assad in the al-Midan district of Damascus . Autocratic: Syrian troops using heavy machine guns and artillery killed 111 people in Kfar Owaid in just 24 hours . Brutal: Supporters wave flags in front of a mural of President Bashar Assad. He has finally allowed international monitors into the country after weeks of stalling . The advance team of monitors will be led by Arab League assistant secretary-general Sameer Seif el-Yazal. Eventually, around 500 observers will be deployed around the country. State TV footage showed warplanes and helicopters firing missiles at targets in an undisclosed desert area. It said: 'The manoeuvres aim to test the capabilities of the air force and air defence to repulse any aggression the enemies of our nation might think about.' Two weeks ago, Syrian forces conducted a similar drill. The exercises appear to be meant as a deterrent against any international action similar to the Nato air campaign that helped oust Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Yesterday, President Assad issued a new law under which anyone found guilty of distributing weapons with the aim of committing 'terrorist acts' would be sentenced to death. The Syrian government claims armed gangs and terrorists are behind the uprising.","Heavy machine guns and artillery fired on town of Kfar Owaid .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:00 AM on 25th December 2011 . Christmas has been cancelled on the majority of the UK’s rail network as services wound down last night for up to 60 hours of train-free yuletide timetables. As millions of families made their festive getaway, train services started to run down in advance of a complete shut-down of the rail network today, with services axed in most areas on Boxing Day, and a late start to a limited Bank Holiday  service on Tuesday. East Coast, Virgin West Coast, First Great Western, Northern Rail, Cross Country, South West trains and  South Eastern are among those writing off the majority of Christmas with blank departure and arrivals boards. Walk-out: London Underground workers will strike on Boxing Day . And many of those trains which do eventually run between Christmas and New Year will be subject to delays, diversions and cancellations caused by engineering works and the dreaded  bus replacement services. In Scotland, railway signal workers started a 72-hour strike yesterday in a dispute over career progression. Just to add to Britons' woes, Tube services will be hit by striking Underground workers who want extra pay to work on Boxing Day. Slow services: Many of those trains which do eventually run between Christmas and New Year will be subject to delays . It means millions of families will have to resort to their cars to visit friends and relatives over the festive period – or simply stay at home. Passenger groups and rail experts in Britain  want to know why British rail passengers have to put up with such a shoddy service – despite pledges by the Conservatives in opposition that they would end the Christmas shut-downs. It comes as passengers face soaring New Year fares averaging 5.9 per cent but potentially as high as 11 per cent. Philip Haigh, business editor of the respected Rail magazine said: ’It’s almost a three-day shut-down. 'Local services should be running – on Boxing day at the very least. It used to happen 30 or 40 years ago. But then the whole country used to work a lot harder over the Christmas period. ‘There’s clearly a demand for travel on Boxing Day – you only have to look at the queues in the busy shops and shopping centres. Some of them, like the Metro Centre in Gateshead and Meadowhall in Sheffield, even have their own stations.’ Up to 18 million cars took to the roads yesterday with a ‘delayed rush hour’ as people set off to spend Christmas with family or to do last-minute Christmas shopping. But there was chaos in the capital as one of the main arterial routes into London was blocked because of a ‘serious structural defect’ at the Hammersmith Flyover on the A4 discovered on Thursday night. Getaway traffic was heavy on major routes, including the M1 in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, the M4 between London and Newbury in Berkshire, the M25 around London, and the M4 and M5 in the West Country. The Highways Agency said 19 sets of roadworks and lane restrictions had been removed to ease congestion, and will not be put back until the new year. However 26 roadworks remain in place including on the M1 near Luton, the M25, and the A1 near Thirsk.","London Underground workers due to walk out on Boxing Day .

In a final attempt to save his family, the last words of pilot Jeffrey Buckalew were not poetic but ones of desperation. 'Seven three one charlie alpha, declaring an . . .' were the final words that Mr Buckalew said over the radio before his plane crashed into a New Jersey highway, as he, his wife, their two children, his co-worker, and dog were all aboard. The two business partners- Mr Buckalew, 45, and Rakesh Chawla, 36- worked at Greenhill & Company in New York but the group was headed south in Mr Buckalew's private plane on Tuesday while he was in the pilot's seat. Their plane had taken off from nearby Teterboro Airport and was flying to DeKalb Peachtree Airport near Atlanta, Georgia, where the Buckalews had relatives and where Mr Chawla was attending a meeting. Reports say that While Mr Buckalew and Mr Chawla worked in New York, his wife Corinne Buckalew and children- Jackson, a fifth grader, and Meriwether, a first grader- lived in Charlottesville, Virginia where they lived in a home they bought for $9.15million in 2006. Mr Chawla, who also had ties to Charlottesville as he attended the University of Virginia, was married and had a daughter at the time of his death. Mr . Buckalew's wife, Corinne, and their two young children, Jackson and . Meriwether, were also on board the plane that was seen losing a wing . before it crashed.

They were going away on a family trip,' a neighbor told The New York Post. Mr Buckalew, who owned the plane and had been a pilot for more than ten years, was head of Greenhill & Company's North American Advisory activities, while Mr Chawla was a managing director. 'The firm is in deep mourning over the tragic and untimely death of two of its esteemed colleagues and members of Jeff’s family,' the company said in a statement. Victims: Corinne Buckalew and her daughter Meriwether were among the five people killed when a small plane crashed on Route 287 on Tuesday morning. Mrs Buckalew's husband Jeffrey and son Jackson also died . 'Jeff was one of the first employees of Greenhill. He and Rakesh were extraordinary professionals who were highly respected by colleagues and clients alike. 'They will be sorely missed and our sympathies go out to their families and friends.' Mr Buckalew was a talented golfer, tying for 94th place on Golf Digest’s list of 'top golfers in finance' in 2007. He flew his plane to board meetings in North Carolina, said James W. May, from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where the father-of-two received his BA and MBA. 'It was clearly something he enjoyed. It brought a smile to his face,' Mr May told the New York Times. Ms Buckalew was a visual artist who was on the board of the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts in Amherst, Virginia. The crash came as a surprise to many who knew Mr Buckalew since he was such an experienced pilot. Wreckage: The cockpit of a small private plane that crashed along a busy New Jersey highway is lifted by a loader onto a flatbed truck. The crash killed five people . Crashed: The plane left Teterboro Airport shortly before crashing on Tuesday . Emergency services remain at the scene of the crash, which occurred at 10 a.m. on Tuesday. Charred debris is strewn beneath the trees and on the highway itself, as seen on helicopter footage from local news stations. Wreckage has been found as far as half a mile away from the site of impact, with a wing found in a tree of a home about a quarter of a mile away. Site: The plane came to a halt in a wooded area separating the north and southbound lanes on I-287 . Chris Covello, from Rockaway Township, told the Associated Press he saw the plane spin out of control. 'It was like the plane was doing tricks or something, twirling and flipping,' he said. 'It started going straight down. I thought any second they were going to pull up. But then the wing came off and they went straight down.' When the plane crashed, it sent up a 'huge plume of thick black smoke', he added. See below for videos .","Two heads of investment company and one of their families perished .

Not only can we kiss goodbye to dreams of a White Christmas this year, it’s not even going to feel that cold. Forecasters say that temperatures over the coming days may be some of the warmest for the time of year in more than a decade – milder than Athens and Barcelona. Temperatures of around 10C to 13C are expected across the country, with some parts of the UK reaching up to 14C. Balmy: A family enjoy a pre-Christmas walk in Brockwell Park, London, yesterday, as temperatures continue to stay unseasonably mild . Winter warmer: Temperatures this month could approach the warmest for this time of year in a decade, according to forecasters . It leaves temperatures close to the warmest Christmas Days on record, registered when thermometers hit 15.6C in 1896 and 1920. Even Scottish mountain peaks will have escaped snowfall. Conditions for today and Boxing Day are likely to be cloudy, blustery and ‘unseasonably mild’. In many parts of the country, temperatures will be several degrees warmer than average – without a snowflake in sight. It’s certainly very different from this time last year, when the country was in the grip of a big freeze and some areas recorded their coldest ever temperature. For example at Altnaharra, in the Scottish Highlands, the mercury plummeted to -18c (-0.4f) But this year, most of us will enjoy temperatures of between 11 and 13c (52 to 55f). The average is around 7 to 10c (45 to 50f) In the South, East and North East temperatures could reach 14c (57f), which would make them the highest since 1997. While there may be drizzle in the South and East, it will begin to clear and most of the country will remain dry  until Tuesday. Chris Bulmer, forecaster for the Met Office said: ‘It’s a stark contrast to last year. Temperatures will be mild for all parts of the UK. A runner takes advantage of the warmer temperatures in Brockwell, London, which could be the highest at Christmas since 1997 . 'We are expecting it cloudy and dry, blustery in the North and breezy in the . ‘This is due to a milder air mass. 'We’re likely to keep this general pattern through to the New Year and then there are likely to be some colder snaps.’ He added: ‘Last Christmas Day there were record minimum temperatures in Wales and Scotland. ‘After a short cooler interlude next midweek, the set-up which has brought the current milder conditions will return, with south-westerly winds.’ It means Britain may have a warmer . Christmas than Athens, Barcelona and Nice, all of which are likely to . experience temperatures of 11c (52f). However, the temperatures will fall short of the Christmas Day record of 15.6c (60f), set in 1896. Other forecasters predicted that, bizarrely, those in the North East could experience some of the warmest weather. Paul . Michaelwhite, forecaster from the website Netweather, said: ‘Because of . fairly strong south-westerly winds, the North East could see some of . the warmest temperatures, with 14c (57f) possible. ‘It . should make for ideal conditions for walking off the Christmas turkey – . although the west and north of Scotland will buck the trend with some . heavy rain.’",Britain could see mildest Christmas Day since 1997 .

A top sports agent who inspired Tom Cruise's character in the hit movie Jerry Maguire is wanted over a $1.4 million debt over unpaid rent. Leigh Steinberg, who has represented NFL stars Troy Aikman and boxer Oscar De La Hoya, has had a bench warrant issued for his arrest. Orange County Superior Court said it was after he failed to appear last week for a case involving a judgment owed to the landlords of his Newport Beach office. Scroll down for video... Inspiration: Leigh Steinberg (left) who inspired Tom Cruise's (right) character in Jerry Maguire is wanted over a $1.4 million debt over unpaid rent . Court papers show the 62-year-old, whose roster has included eight No 1 overall NFL draft picks and who lives in California, was ordered to pay $1.4 million last year to the Irvine Company. But he stopped paying under the terms of his lease in 2009, according to court papers filed by the landlord, which declined to comment on the case. Steinberg defended his court no-show by saying he had asked his attorney to change the date of his December 15 hearing and was told it was taken care of. He said he was unaware he had a warrant in the case, which stems from some payments he missed in 2009 before moving to less expensive office space, and that he was not 'running from the law'. He told Associated Press in a phone interview: 'Since when in this country do you put people in jail for having debt? 'The point is, I had some financial struggles, which I regret. And I am working hard right now to pay the debts I owe.' Agent: Steinberg represented NLF star Troy Aikman (left) and boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya (right) Steinberg said his financial troubles stemmed in part from his divorce in 2006. The Irvine Company earlier this month asked the court to require Steinberg to apply a portion of his income stream to pay the judgment, alleging process servers have been unable to directly contact him. Brooke Brandt, an attorney for the Orange County real estate company, wrote in a December 9 court filing: 'Steinberg is a semi famous figure with huge apparent notoriety but shows signs of significant recent deterioration. 'He appears to have a phalanx of security protection around him that prevents process servers from gaining access to him unless he allows it.' The next hearing in the case is scheduled for February 6. Steinberg is considered the first super agent in sports, having also represented such NFL stars as Warren Moon and Ben Roethlisberger. He began his career in 1975 and was able to secure huge signing bonuses for some of football's biggest stars.","Leigh Steinberg represented NFL star Troy Aikman .

The two surviving children of the ex-police inspector who stabbed his wife and a third child to death were discharged from hospital today. Adam and Kimberley Day were due to spend Christmas day with relatives after their father Toby allegedly stabbed their mother, Samantha, and sister Genevieve, to death, before taking his own life on December 8. The children had spent two weeks in hospital recovering from serious injuries at the Queen's Medical Centre, Notts. Tragic: Toby Day and wife Samantha pictured with their three children Kimberley, Adam and Genevieve. Adam and Kimberley have now been discharged from hospital two weeks after suffering serious injuries in the attack . Day, 37, had been dismissed from the force days before attacking his wife, 38, and children - Kimberley, 15, Adam, 12, and Genevieve - at their home in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. Detective Chief Superintendent Andy Hough, who is leading a team of officers from Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire investigating the deaths, said: 'Adam and Kimberley came out of hospital on Saturday and are spending Christmas with family. 'We have still not done any formal interviews - that will be post-Christmas. We will wait to see if we can do anything between Christmas and the new year. 'We are building up to it, we would like to do it before the children go back to school.' Fatal attack: Day with Samantha, whom he knifed to death at their home on December 8 . Det Chief Supt Hough, head of the East Midlands special operations unit major crime team, said: 'We have an account given voluntarily by Adam and we have had two people who were in the area at the relevant times and they have confirmed what we expected them to say from Adam's account and we are happy with that. 'Medically, Adam and Kimberley are getting a lot stronger. They both suffered very serious injuries. 'I don't think anyone could try to put themselves in the place of the children and what they are feeling at this time.' He said the children were receiving a lot of support from family and professionals to help them deal with the trauma. Scene: The family home in Melton Mowbray, where the attack took place. Kimberley is thought to have made her escape through the broken fence . He added: 'We have spoken to people who spoke to Toby or Samantha on the day about where they were on the Thursday, who they spoke to in person and on the phone, to get a picture of their movements and their lifestyle. 'We have a good picture of what happened. We know the who, the where and the when, but we don't know the why. There's only one person could tell us that and he's not around any more.' The attack followed Day’s dismissal after a disciplinary hearing for misusing force computers. He is thought to have suspected his wife of having an affair and was looking for information. It is also alleged that he may have worked on the case of a man who killed his family in similar circumstances earlier this year. Day, pictured with a certificate honouring his outstanding police work, had been sacked by his force a week before he took his own life . Det Chief Supt Hough said: 'A lot of people are grieving as well as the family, including former colleagues, the people of Melton Mowbray and the neighbourhood where the family lived. 'It is important at this stage for Adam and Kimberley to get settled back into their family and that their longer-term care is identified. 'A lot of thought must be about where their guardianship comes from. 'Their thoughts must be about who will look after them and where they're going to live and, as far as possible, get back to normality in the best way they possibly can. 'They've got to try to get some normality back into their lives, to try to make it the same as it was before, as far as is possible. 'A lot of the support to do that will come from their family.'","Adam, 12, and Kimberley Day, 15, will spend Christmas Day with relatives .

A Chinese court has jailed a writer for nine years for inciting subversion after publishing four essays online. Chen Wei had called for freedom of speech and reform of the country's one-party political system. He was among hundreds of dissidents arrested last February after online calls for protests in China inspired by the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. His trial behind closed doors in the city of Suining in southwestern China, lasted about two hours and the verdict was announced 30 minutes later. The sentence is believed to be one of . the most severe imposed on those involved in the so-called Jasmine . Revolution - the attempt to replicate the Arab Spring uprising in China. After the verdict, Mr Chen told the court: 'Dictatorship will fail, democracy will prevail,' according to his lawyer Zheng Jianwei. The trial was the first time Chen's wife, . Wang Xiaoyan, had seen her husband since he was detained and said he had aged a lot. She added: 'I think today's trial is . just a show. It's a performance. The verdict had been decided in . advance. They don't allow people to speak. There is no freedom of . speech.' Iconic image: A lone Chinese protester stands defiantly in front of tanks after Chinese forces crushed a pro democracy demonstration in Tiananmen Square in 1989 . She said his essays had been misinterpreted their meaning distorted, and he had done nothing to incite subversion. 'What's wrong with a person freely expressing his ideas?' said Mrs Wang. 'He is a very patriotic man.' She told the BBC her husband would not appeal the sentence and added: 'We have a daughter who is not even 10 years old. I need to slowly explain why her father is in jail.' Mr Chen, 42, has previously served five years for participating in the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing, where he was attending college In 1994. Wang Songlian, a researcher with Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a Hong Kong-based advocacy group, condemned the government's crackdown. Memories: A student in Hong Kong cleans a plaque commemorating the deaths of protesters in Tiananmen Square . She said: 'This severe punishment against an activist caught up in the Jasmine crackdown shows how the Chinese government's nerves are still jittery. 'All its latest moves, its attempts to control its microblogs, its crackdown on activists, show it is increasing tightening freedom of expression and other civil liberties.' Jailed: Nobel prize winner Liu Xiaobo . Others rounded up in this year's crackdown who have been punished include Beijing activist Wang Lihong, who was sentenced to nine months in September for staging a protest on behalf of other activists, and Yang Qiuyu, a Beijing activist who was sentenced to two years of re-education through labour. China's Communist leadership, which does not tolerate any perceived challenge to one-party rule, was spooked early this year when anonymous online messages called for a Chinese 'Jasmine Revolution' - the name of the uprising in Tunisia. Even though few outright demonstrators responded to the protest calls, China launched one of its broadest campaigns of repression in years, rounding up dozens of bloggers, lawyers and intellectuals. Most have since been released. Amnesty International said Chen's sentence was only the latest case of the government's use of the vague charge of inciting subversion against its political critics. 'It's heartbreaking news and clearly retaliation for Chen Wei's peaceful critique of the Chinese Communist Party,' said Catherine Baber, Amnesty International's deputy director for Asia. 'Chen Wei is a prisoner of conscience and should be released immediately.' Others jailed in recent years on the same charge include Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, for 11 years, and veteran activist Liu Xianbin, for 10 years.","'Dictatorship will fail, democracy will prevail,' he tells court after two-hour trial ."

Prosecutors have launched a criminal inquiry after receiving a complaint that Aidan Burley and 12 of his friends had ‘incited racial hatred and glorified crimes against humanity’. The 32-year-old MP for Cannock Chase in Staffordshire was celebrating with the group in the resort of Val Thorens earlier this month. Nasty party: Groom Mark Fournier attended his stag party dressed as a member of the infamous SS, while other guests saluted Hitler . During the stag party, accountant Mark Fournier, a 34-year-old Oxford graduate, wore a replica SS uniform. Another guest, sitting next to the MP in a restaurant, was filmed  raising a toast to ‘the ideology and thought process of the Third Reich’. Later, after moving on to a British-themed pub, some of the group chanted: ‘Mein Fuhrer! Mein Fuhrer! Mein Fuhrer!’, ‘Himmler! Himmler! Himmler!’ and ‘Eichmann! Eichmann! Eichmann!’ Heinrich Himmler founded the SS, while he and Adolf Eichmann were responsible for the Holocaust. Sacked: MP Aidan Burley was dismissed from his post as parliamentary private secretary . A spokesman for Albertville prosecutors said a preliminary inquiry had been opened, and that those involved could receive up to six months in prison and large fines if convicted. Julien Andrez, counsel for La Foundue restaurant, where the stag night started, said they had filed a criminal complaint, as had Hamdy Boussouiba, director of French pressure group SOS Racism. Calling for Mr Burley to be fired, Mr Boussoiba said: ‘The hotel management should have made a complaint straight away, but  better late than never.’ Mr Burley, who has since been sacked from his post as a parliamentary private secretary, has apologised for his ‘crass and insensitive’ behaviour and the ‘terrible offence’ he caused. He strenuously denies that he took part in toasts to the Third Reich, and has distanced himself from the ‘inexcusable behaviour’ of other guests at the party.  But Mr Burley would not directly address claims that he hired the SS uniform for the stag night. The Conservative Party said it was launching an investigation into Mr Burley’s behaviour. Under the French penal code, it is a crime, unless required for a film, play or historical exhibition, to exhibit in public a uniform or insignia reminiscent of those worn by the Nazis. Strongly condemned: MP Aiden Burley (right) with Mark Fournier and other guests during their Alpine stag night . Complaint: Owners of restaurant La Fondue filed a complaint against members of the stag party . Mr Burley said last night: ‘I have not been contacted by the French authorities and I have repeatedly apologised for what was clearly inappropriate behaviour which caused offence to others. ‘Being involved in a stag party where an SS uniform was worn was wrong and offensive. It was the wrong decision on my part, crass and insensitive. 'I am deeply sorry, and want to take this opportunity to offer the people of  Cannock Chase an unreserved, wholehearted and full apology for the terrible offence this incident has undoubtedly caused.’ Tasteless: Mark Fournier's brother, John, gave the 'Third Reich' toast .","MP could face jail term for attending Nazi-themed party .

At least 69 people were killed and more than 190 wounded in a wave of co-ordinated bombings across Baghdad yesterday, days after U.S. forces finally left. The 16 blasts were immediately blamed on Al Qaeda in Iraq because of the sheer scale of the operation and the expertise involved. A variety of bombing techniques were used in 11 neighbourhoods. There was one suicide bomber, two vehicles packed with explosives, some roadside bombs and other so-called ‘sticky’ bombs underneath cars. Scroll down for video... Devastated: Iraqi security forces inspect a crater caused by a car bomb in the Karrada area of Baghdad . Inspection: Security forces watch over the scene . of a car bomb attack in Karrada (left) and the remnants of an explosion . in the Karrada district . Blasts: A series of bombs have exploded in central Baghdad in the first wave of violence since U.S. forces quit the country just days ago . Security spokesman Major General Qassim Atta said the bombers targeted schools, workers and an anti-corruption agency. ‘They were not security targets,’ he said. One blast killed seven people as they helped the victims of a previous explosion. The carnage – the worst to hit Baghdad in months – came after the last American troops left Iraq last Sunday, nearly nine years after the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Many Iraqis had feared a return to sectarian violence without a U.S. military buffer. Iraq’s fragile power-sharing government is grappling with its worst turmoil since its formation a year ago. Shi’ite, Sunni and Kurdish blocs share out government posts in a unwieldy system that has been impaired by political infighting since it began. This week Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki moved to sideline two Sunni Muslim leaders, stirring tensions. Al Qaeda is mainly Sunni and security officials believe insurgents had been waiting for a worsening sectarian relationship to unleash attacks. Most appeared to hit Shi’ite neighbourhoods, although some Sunni areas were also targeted. British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the attacks as 'cowardly'. He has urged leaders to 'pull together' in the wake of the blasts to aid the country's political stability. He said: 'I condemn the attacks that took place in Baghdad this morning, resulting in the death and injury of a large number of people. I offer my condolences to the bereaved and injured. These cowardly attacks come at a time of political tension in Iraq. 'I hope that leaders from across the political and sectarian spectrum will pull together to establish a dialogue to ensure Iraq's political stability and to build a stable future. The UK will support Iraq in its efforts to defeat extremism and terrorism.' Iraqi officials said at least 14 blasts went off early this morning in 11 neighbourhoods around the city. The violence ranged from sticky bombs attached to cars to roadside bombs and vehicles packed with explosives. In the southwestern neighbourhood of Karrada, where one of the victims was killed, sirens could be heard as ambulances rushed to the scene and a large plume of smoke rose over the explosion site.

They come at a precarious time in Iraq's political history, just days after American troops pulled out of Iraq. The government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has accused the Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi of running a hit squad that targeted government officials. Al-Maliki is also pushing for a vote of no-confidence against another Sunni politician, the deputy prime minister Saleh al-Mutlaq. Many Sunnis fear that this is part of a wider campaign to go after Sunni political figures in general and shore up Shiite control across the country at a critical time when all American troops have left Iraq. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the morning's violence. But the coordinated nature of the assault and the fact that the attacks took place in numerous neighbourhoods suggested a planning capability only available to Al Qaeda in Iraq. Many of the neighbourhoods were also Shiite areas which are a favourite target of the terrorist organisation. The Sunni extremist group often targets Shiites who they believe are not true Muslims. Al Qaeda in Iraq is severely debilitated from its previous strength in the early years of the war, but is still able to launch coordinated and deadly assaults from time to time. U.S. military officials have said they are worried about a resurgence of the group after the American military leaves the country. If that happens, it could lead Shiite militants to fight back and attack Sunni targets, thus sending Iraq back to the sectarian violence it experienced just a few years ago.

Britain looks to have missed out on its warmest ever Christmas Day by just 1.3C but the weather was still balmy enough to see Northern Ireland break its maximum temperature record. An exceptionally mild Christmas Day has seen weather experts monitoring their equipment with the British record for Christmas Day under threat. So far, the provisional measurements suggest that the 15.6C maximum - set in 1896 and repeated in 1920 - has not been exceeded. A very near miss came in Churchfenton, where a provisional figure of 14.0C has been recorded, and the country enjoyed its third warmest Christmas Day ever. Red sky in the morning, Christmas warm-ing: Dawn brought a fiery sunrise in Barnard Castle, County Durham, on a very mild Christmas morning . Balmy: A family enjoy a pre-Christmas walk in Brockwell Park, London, yesterday, as temperatures continue to stay unseasonably mild . Winter warmer: Temperatures this month could approach the warmest for this time of year in a decade, according to forecasters . While there could still be a British . record today, the best window of opportunity has now passed with . temperatures beginning to drop. However, one record did fall today as Northern Ireland saw its warmest ever Christmas Day. The mercury crept up to 14.3C in Murlough, breaking the record of 13.0C which was set in 1988. And a year-on-year comparison makes . for amazing readying, with the the same day last year offering a . bone-chilling -17.5C in Katesbridge - a temperature swing of 30.5C in . Northern Ireland on the big day. At Aberdeen airport in Scotland, a . temperature of 14.8 was recorded, just 0.8C below the record of 14.8C, . which has stood since 1896. 'It is a very different Christmas Day to last year,' said Met Office forecaster Michael Lawrence. A runner takes advantage of the warmer temperatures in Brockwell, London, which could be the highest at Christmas since 1997 . 'This year Northern Ireland has seen . its maximum temperature broken, while England, Wales and Scotland are . all close to their maximum temperature, but it looks as it they are . going to fall slightly short. 'It has been exceptionally mild in . the north of the UK in particular, and temperatures generally have been . around the 11 and 12 mark.' Forecasters had also predicted there . would be severe winds today and they were not disappointed as gusts of . 136mph were recorded in Cairgorms, Scotland. The warm weather had dashed hopes of a . White Christmas as the country woke up to gentle sunshine, with County . Durham beginning with a brilliant scarlet and orange sunrise. Even . Scottish mountain peaks have so far escaped snowfall. Looking forward, football fans - and . fans of good weather in general - can expect some holiday sport without . the usual chill, as Boxing Day is also set to be a mild day. 'After Boxing Day temperatures will . slowly start to fall back, returning to closer to what we'd expect at . this time of year,' said Aisling Creevey, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, . the Press Association's weather division. Despite today's maximum temperature . not tumbling, forecasters say that the coming days will remain some of . the warmest for the time of year in more than a decade – milder than . Athens and Barcelona. It’s certainly very different from . this time last year, when the country was in the grip of a big freeze . and some areas recorded their coldest ever temperature. Last year in Altnaharra, in the Scottish Highlands, the mercury plummeted to -18c. Chris Bulmer, a forecaster for the Met Office said: ‘It’s a stark contrast to last year. This is due to a milder air mass. 'We’re likely to keep this general pattern through to the New Year and then there are likely to be some colder snaps.’ He added: ‘Last Christmas Day there were record minimum temperatures in Wales and Scotland. Spring time sun: Nine-year-old Emily .

An average temperature of 10.32C or . 50.58f between March 1 and May 29 beats the previous record of 1893, . when Queen Victoria was on the throne and William Gladstone was Prime . Minister.

"Last updated at 12:40 PM on 24th December 2011 . A woman has admitted breaching an Asbo for keeping 100 dogs at her home - after being caught with another 45. Police seized 80 dogs from Diana Curtis in April last year and ordered her not to keep more than 14 pets in future. But magistrates heard that she now has 45 at her rural home after neighbours complained about the noise from the mixed-breed pack. Can't help herself: Diana Curtis, pictured with one of her dogs, has breached an Asbo given to her for keeping 100 canines at her Devon home . Curtis, 54, of Winscott Lawn, Peters Marland, Devon, admitted breaching her anti-social behaviour order, which had been made after Torridge District Council received complaints about the dogs barking. The case has already cost the police £30,000 in vets' bills and kennelling fees. Prosecutor Neil Lawson told magistrates in Barnstaple: 'Police visited the farm in March and June when only the 14 dogs were visible but by the end of the summer more noise disturbances were reported.' When police visited at the end of the summer about 30 animals could be seen. By October, this had grown to 39 with some bitches visibly pregnant and several dogs appearing semi-feral. Mr Lawson said: 'When the police questioned Ms Curtis about the dogs she said ""I know I have too many but I just can't help myself"".' Zara Svensson, mitigating, said: 'The most important things in her life are her dogs. 'She said to me earlier: ""I don't care what happens to me today, the care of the dogs is what matters."" Breach: North Devon Magistrates' Court (above) in Barnstable heard how police found dozens of dogs after being called by angry neighbours . Magistrate Robin Hagley said: 'It seems to us your concerns for animals, dogs in particular, has got you into more serious trouble.' The court ordered all of the animals to be removed except 14, which will be left with Curtis until January 10, on the understanding that she will re-home them herself by that date. If they are still on the farm, police will have to remove eight of them. Curtis was also fined £150 for breaching the Asbo. Torridge police Inspector Shaun Kenneally, who attended the hearing, said afterwards: 'We just don't have the money to spend on something like this and it is the taxpayers' money. This case has needed a lot of preparation from all agencies involved.' At a time of year when animal charities can be overwhelmed, the dogs previously owned by Diana Curtis are costing two charities an average of £10 per day per dog. The Dogs Trust took 32 dogs from her farm while the RSPCA took two. The Dogs Trust has estimated, on the basis each animal will stay for an average of 38 days, it will cost the charity £365 per animal. If this is taken as an average figure the Dogs Trust's expenditure on this one case could easily reach £12,000. It is believed when 47 dogs were previously removed from the site last year the Dogs Trust incurred a cost of over £17,000. A spokeswoman from the trust said: 'Some of the dogs have been taken to the trust's centre at Ilfracombe and others have been taken up to Evesham, Worcestershire. All the dogs from the last seizure have now been re-homed by the trust. But the trust is unable to say how well the re-homing process will go this time as many of the animals need to become used to being in a house, which can take an indefinite amount of time for the older dogs. Speaking after her hearing Diana Curtis said: 'This is totally out of proportion - the dogs aren't that noisy. 'They may bark but not constantly. 'I've brought it on myself - but I haven't run anybody over I don't knock people about or grow cannabis.' She added she'd learned her lesson, saying 'I can't take anymore.' Neighbour Mike Lamprey of Peters Marland parish council said enough was enough. 'Dogs should be around humans in small numbers - not in large numbers like this - then the pack instinct takes over. The law must not be made a mockery of.'","Diana Curtis told she could only have 14 pets in house .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Last updated at 12:24 AM on 24th December 2011 . Gangland killing: Amateur footballer Kevin Nunes was gunned down in a country lane in 2002 . Four police chiefs are at the centre of a corruption inquiry over claims that five gangland killers are the victims of a miscarriage of justice. The actions of the officers, who occupy senior positions at three forces, are being examined by an independent watchdog. They include Northamptonshire Chief Constable Adrian Lee, the Association of Chief Police Officers’ spokesman on policing ethics, and his deputy Suzette Davenport. The probe was sparked by lawyers representing some of the five men jailed for life in 2008 for the murder of drug dealer and amateur footballer Kevin Nunes. He was gunned down by a ‘firing squad’ after being driven to a   country lane in Staffordshire in 2002. Questions have been raised over the complex six-year inquiry which a senior judge praised as ‘extremely skilful’. The convicted killers’ legal teams brought the case to the Court of Appeal over fears that key information was not disclosed ahead of the trial. Under investigation: Chief constable Adrian Lee, right, and deputy chief constable Suzette Davenport, left, are two of four senior officers under the microscope . Judges alerted the Criminal Cases Review Commission which is responsible for investigating potential miscarriages of justice. Officials uncovered fresh material about the conduct of officers and . notified the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Derbyshire Chief . Constable Mick Creedon was brought in to oversee the secret and . sensitive inquiry. Among the allegations being investigated by his team . are claims of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and misconduct . in a public office. Nine serving or former Staffordshire officers have been handed official . notices warning them that they are under investigation. They include the . two Northamptonshire chief officers, Staffordshire Assistant Chief . Constable Jane Sawyers and West Midlands Assistant Chief Constable . Marcus Beale. None of the senior officers, who were told they were under investigation . this month, has been suspended. But it is extremely rare, and possibly . unprecedented, for four officers of such senior rank to be under . investigation in such circumstances over the same inquiry. All of them have held senior posts at Staffordshire Police in the period . since 2002. Mr Lee rose through the senior ranks to become acting chief . constable. Two assistant chief constables are also involved in the IPCC case - Jane Sawyers from Staffordshire Police, left, and Marcus Beale from West Midlands Police . Nunes, 20, a talented footballer who was once on the books at Tottenham . Hotspur, was shot five times on September 19, 2002. The drug dealer had . been released from custody in Aberdeen 24 hours earlier. Police suspected the shooting was the result of a turf war between . criminals in the West Midlands battling to control the Scottish drugs . market. Levi Walker, Adam Joof, Antonio Christie, Michael Osbourne, 28, . and Owen Crooks were jailed for up to 28 years each at Leicester Crown . Court in 2008. Detectives were initially met by a wall of silence but eventually persuaded a witness to give evidence against the gunmen. Mr Lee became the head of Northamptonshire Police in 2009. Northamptonshire Police Authority said it was ‘completely confident’ in . Mr Lee and Miss Davenport and did not want the inquiry to detract from . their daily work. Staffordshire Police Authority said the official notices were ‘not . judgmental in any way’ and the investigation must be allowed to run  its . course.",Four include Northamptonshire Police Authority chief constable Adrian Lee who is head of Association of Chief Police Officers' ethics portfolio .

A total of 3,089 English and Welsh fans were arrested at international and domestic games in 2010/11, down 302 from the previous season - the lowest level since records began in 1984/5. There were no arrests at 70 per cent of games and 92 per cent of those whose football banning orders have expired since 2000 were assessed by police as no longer posing a risk of football disorder. Good news: New figures have revealed that the number of people arrested for football-related disorder fell to a record low last season . The figures have been released in the same week that an England football supporter was jailed for three years for killing an innocent Wales fan outside Wembley Stadium in September. 1) Cardiff City - 143 . 2) Leeds United - 106 . 3) Chelsea - 105 . 4) Manchester United - 101 . 5) West Ham - 100 . Crime Prevention Minister Lord Henley . said: 'Football policing is a real British success story. Where . hooliganism was once described as ""the English disease"", we now set an . example for others to follow.' The number of football banning orders in place in November also fell, down to 3,173 from 3,248 last year. These . included 105 against Chelsea fans - 10 per cent of all the banning . orders in the Premier League and the most of any team at that level - . 101 against Manchester United fans and 98 against Newcastle United fans. In the Championship, Cardiff City fans topped the list with 143 banning orders - the most of any club in England and Wales - followed by Leeds United (106) and West Ham (100). Fans of League Two’s Dagenham and Redbridge were the only group with no banning orders, the figures showed.

"By . Paul Sims . Last updated at 1:04 AM on 26th December 2011 . The thugs behind this summer’s riots were no worse than Britain’s bankers, the Archbishop of Canterbury suggested yesterday. Delivering his Christmas sermon at Canterbury Cathedral, Rowan Williams claimed society had been torn apart by the violence that erupted in August. ‘The most pressing question we now face, we might well say, is who and where we are as a society,’ said Dr Williams. ‘Bonds have been broken, trust abused and lost. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams gives his Christmas address at Canterbury Cathedral . ‘Whether it is an urban rioter mindlessly burning down a small shop that serves his community, or a speculator turning his back on the question of who bears the ultimate cost for his acquisitive adventures in the virtual reality of today’s financial world, the picture is of atoms spinning apart in the dark. ‘And into that dark the Word of God has entered, in love and judgment, and has not been overcome; in the darkness the question sounds as clear as ever, to each of us and to our church and our society: “Britain, where are you?” Where are the words we can use to answer?’ He asked the congregation to learn lessons about mutual obligation from the events of the past year. His comments, which formed part of his closing remarks, will undoubtedly spark debate among those who claim the rioters were crying out for help and those who believe their behaviour was wanton vandalism. Making reference to the Book of Common Prayer, which reaches its 350th anniversary next year, the Archbishop said it was an example of how ideas of duty and common interest can be expressed. Tottenham: Silhouetted against a blazing building, riot officers in formation prepare for the next wave of attack during the summer's riots . ‘The world has changed, the very rhythms of our speech have changed, our society is irreversibly more plural, and we have – with varying degrees of reluctance – found other and usually less resonant ways of talking to God and identifying who we are in his presence,’ he said. ‘If we used only the Prayer Book these days we’d risk confusing the strangeness of the mysteries of faith with the strangeness of antique and lovely language. 'But we’re much the poorer for forgetting it and pushing it to the margins as much as we often do in the Church. And it is crucial to remember the point about the Prayer Book as something for a whole society, binding together our obligations to God and to one another, in a dense interweaving of love and duty joyfully performed.’ It is not the first time the Archbishop has highlighted August’s disturbances, which spread from Tottenham in North London to cities across the country, including Manchester and Birmingham. Earlier this month he spoke about the ‘enormous sadness’ he felt during the riots, watching homes and shops being destroyed. In his spiritual message, the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, called for Britons to turn their backs on materialism and remember the meaning of Christmas. ‘The message of Christmas is clearly about that authentic peace child, Jesus Christ,’ he said.","'Bonds have been broken, trust abused and lost', Dr Rowan Williams tells congregation ."

Tomorrow night either Melanie Amaro, Josh Krajcik or Chris Rene will be crowned winner, and will go home $5 million richer. Tonight all three contestants sang duets with some of the biggest names in the music business. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Crunch time: It was crunch time on the X Factor . tonight, as the final three finalists, left to right Chris Rene, Melanie Amaro and Josh Krajcik had their last chances to wow both . the judges and the public . Crowd pleasers: All three finalists had the judges jumping up and down in their seats . Josh Krajcik performed with Alanis Morissette, Chris Rene did a duet with Avril Lavigne and Melanie Amaro took to the stage with R. Kelly. Krajcik, 30, opened the show, singing Morisette's hit Uninvited, from the hit soundtrack to the 1998 film City of Angels. The audience was shocked and surprised when Alanis actually joined the Columbus, Ohio native on stage to power through the harmonies. Electric: Krajcik, 30, opened the show, singing Alanis Morissette's hit Uninvited, from the hit soundtrack to the 1998 film City of Angels . Hugs: Following the performance, the Grammy-Award winning singer praised Krajcik, saying that he was a 'very soulful man' 'Ladies and gentleman, I cannot believe ‭I am inviting to the stage, the amazing Alanis Morrisette,' Krajcik yelled through the microphone, beaming. Clearly . a little shaky at first, he sang along with the 37-year-old Canadian . singer, the two going in and out of the verses together. Following the performance, the Grammy-Award winning singer praised Krajcik, saying that he was a 'very soulful man'. 'Wow, that was surreal,' judge L.A. Reid exclaimed.' It was such a natural pairing, for you to sing with Alanis Morrisette.' Two peas in a pod: Next up with was Chris Rene and pop star Avril Lavigne, who performed her hit song Complicated together in matching leather . Owning the stage: Chris as always looked at home on the stage, rapping up a storm to cheers from the crowd . 'I couldn't think of a better way to . open this competition tonight,' added Paula Abdul. 'Not only did you . hold your own, you but you kept your identity, dignity and integrity.' But Simon wasn't as impressed, pointing out that he thought Krajcik was intimidated by Alanis. 'Josh I thought you were a little bit intimidated at the beginning... but it was an eight out of 10,' he said in a lukewarm tone. But Krajcik's mentor Nicole Scherzinger refuted Simon's claims, telling Josh that 'the sign of a true artist is acknowledging the other person you're singing with. It shows how wonderful and generous you are as an artist.' Close: Also cosy with her superstar singer, was Simon Cowell's finalist Melanie Amaro who did a duet with R'n'B legend R. Kelly . Thrilled: It was the first time R. Kelly has ever let someone duet the song with him . Next up with was Chris Rene and Avril Lavigne, who performed her hit song Complicated together in matching leather. 'Ladies and Gentleman, the moment you have been waiting for, Avril Lavigne,' Rene said motivating the already roaring audience. Like a teenage girl Avril was jumping up and down at the sidelines, clearly eager to get on stage with Rene. The pair were like two peas in a pod with Avril even doing some rapping with Rene. 'That was kick a**. Chris is amazing. I think everyone should vote for him!' Avril said of Rene following the performance. 'It was a little shaky in the take off, but you came out on top... By the end your energy was so flipping infectious. You shined up there!' Nicole praised. Laughs: Judges L.A Reid and Nicole Scherzinger had a few laughs on the night . Fights: As always Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul were at loggerheads during the night . 'You just sang with Avril Lavigne... What a wonderful, current, feel-good performance,' Paula gushed. Simon said he thought that Rene looked comfortable throughout the performance. 'When it kicked in, I felt your total joy and confidence... And that would be a record,' he said. L.A agreed, saying his protege: 'looked really at home with Avril.' You guys looked like you were cut from the same cloth,' he said. 'I agree with Simon; that could be a record that we could cut tomorrow, and it would be a big hit.' Classic: Krajcik used his soulful vocals to do a rendition of Etta James classic At Last for his second performance . Going wild: Fans from his hometown in Wooster, Ohio were going nuts for the 30-year-old . Also cosy with her superstar singer was Simon Cowell's finalist Melanie Amaro. The 19-year-old from Florida held hands with R. Kelly as they performed his hit power ballad, I Believe I Can Fly, the first time he has ever allowed someone to duet the song with him. Following the performance, Kelly had nothing but praise for the diva in the making, telling the judges and audience members that 'There's no doubt in my mind this girl is on her way to the moon.' Considering she was singing with one of R'n'B's legends, L.A still thought that Melanie shouldn't have been outshined as much by Kelly. 'If I am to be honest (and you know that I love you), I felt like you got a little bit overshadowed by R. Kelly. I expect more from you,' he said. Celebration: Rene did an updated version of his rap Young Homie, celebrating eight months of sobriety just yesterday . Tears: The rapper broke down in tears following the judges remarks about his performance . 'I think that she did the best that she could. She put a thousand percent into that performance,' argued Nicole. And Simon had nothing but praise for his protege. 'I wouldn't listen to grumpy and dumpy over there (referring to L.A)... to me that was an incredible duet,' he said. 'You didn't look like someone in a talent competition, you looked like someone that could be a really important and established artist.' For the second round the contestants went back to solo, singing their signature sounds that they have best become renown for. Krajcik, Rene, Amaro all sang their songs from their original auditions. So proud: Rene's mother had a cake with the words 'believe' emblazoned across the front as she watched from his hometown of Santa Cruz, California . Krajcik used his soulful vocals to do a rendition of Etta James classic, At Last, throwing in some guitar playing for good measure. On the LED-lit stage, all of the judges thought he looked at home on the stage. 'I am so proud man, you look so at home up there man... You are such a rock star,' L.A said. 'You took your guitar and made it your own.' 'You owned that stage.' praised Paula. 'Great job tonight.'

The lawyer and accountant for reclusive mining heiress Huguette Clark have both lost out on an $8million payday each after a judge suspended them from handling her $400 million estate. Attorney Wallace Bock and accountant Irving Kamsler committed ‘shocking’ tax fraud which meant Miss Clark, who died aged 104 in May, had an IRS bill of $90million, ruled Judge Kristin Booth Glen. The duo are being probed criminally over the Montana heiress’s unpaid federal gift taxes and penalties, a court in Manhattan, New York, heard. Investigators warn this is the ‘tip of the iceberg’. Reclusive: Huguette Clark, who died aged 104 in May, was a U.S. senator's daughter who owned the largest residence on Fifth Avenue in New York City - and mansions in California and Connecticut . Mr Kamsler said he planned to resign on Tuesday but has not done so yet. The duo are beginning to tell conflicting stories about the handling of the last 15 years of Miss Clark’s life, reported MNSBC. A remaining estate official said he is trying to get back the gift of a $5million cheque to Miss Clark's registered nurse, Hadassah Peri, which Mr Bock allegedly had no authority to give her. This was part of a $26million gift given to the nurse even before she left her more than $30million in her will. Neither Mr Bock nor Mr Kamsler have been charged with doing anything illegal. But now the estate will be managed only by public administrator lawyers who alleged the fraud earlier this week. Judge Glen slammed the duo for wasting money and called them ‘unfit to serve’. Suspended: Attorney Wallace Bock, left, and accountant Irving Kamsler, right, committed ‘shocking’ tax fraud which meant Miss Clark, who died aged 104 in May, had an IRS bill of $90million, ruled Judge Kristin Booth Glen . Angry: Judge Kristin Booth Glen called them 'unfit to serve' Mr Bock and Mr Kamsler allegedly did not file federal gift tax returns for Miss Clark from 1997 to 2003 when she gave gifts worth $56million, reported MSNBC. The taxes would have been $41.5million. The duo also made her pay for tax returns that were not filed and did not tell her about unpaid taxes or possible penalties even though she could have afforded them, the court heard. They were also said to have lied to the IRS and the public administrator and submitted tax returns which they knew were fraudulent. This raises the possibility of criminal charges being brought. Mr Kamsler, 64, of the Bronx, New York, is a registered sex offender who tried to distribute ‘indecent materials’ to teenage girls in an AOL chat room. Mr Bock, 79, is from Queens, New York. Vacant: The mysterious Clark estate in Santa Barbara, California, which has been empty since 1963. It is worth more than $100 million . For sale: Le Beau Château, in wealthy New Canaan, Connecticut, is only an hour from New York City but Miss Clark had never visited the property . Windfall: Hadassah Peri received a staggering multi-million payment from Miss Clark when she died . The duo were paid thousands of dollars a month for responsibilities that included dealing with the heiress's taxes. But earlier this week they denied doing anything wrong over Miss Clark’s affairs. ‘Their entire, decades-long handling of her affairs was an ongoing effort to protect and preserve her chosen lifestyle and on her explicit instructions,’ said lawyer John Dadakis, representing the duo. Miss Clark was a U.S. senator's daughter who owned the largest residence on Fifth Avenue in New York City - and mansions in California and Connecticut - but chose to live for decades in hospitals. It emerged last month that Miss Clark had signed two wills within six weeks in 2005 - the first leaving most of her estate to great-nephews and great-nieces. Holed up: Miss Clark rarely left her 42-room New York apartment overlooking Central Park in 70 years . With dad: Former U.S. Senator William A. Clark, centre, joins his daughter, Huguette, at the Easter Parade in New York, in April 1922. He built one of America's biggest fortunes of its day by mining copper . The second benefitted mainly her nurse and charity, creating an arts foundation that Mr Bock and Mr Kamsler would oversee and leaving them each $500,000. Her father, Senator William A. Clark, built one of America's biggest fortunes of its day mining copper, building railroads and founding Las Vegas, Nevada. Born in Paris to the 67-year-old U.S. senator and a 28-year-old Michigan woman, Miss Clark was married briefly in her 20s to a bank clerk. They parted after only nine months. She died childless. After her mother's death, Miss Clark's once lively life amid New York's cultured world became more solitary, and she rarely ventured from her home. She moved into a hospital in the 1980s.","Montana mining heiress Huguette Clark died in New York in May aged 104 .

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 2:33 PM on 21st December 2011 . Apple is reportedly in talks with senior television figures about its Apple iTV product - an voice-controlled all-in-one flatscreen that was the brainchild of late CEO Steve Jobs. But the release of iTV has prompted a lot of top TV makers to start looking into the idea of voice-control - with or without linguistic skills to match Apple's Siri voice assistant. LG is leading the charge - with a new voice-enabled version of its 'Magic' gesture-controlled remote. The product should be on show at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January - alongside a lot of other iTV wannabes, analysts predict. The new 'Magic' voice remote will let users speak to control their televisions - a microphone and voice-recognition software built into the remote make your voice work like an internet search . 'The new Magic Remote will make it easier for users to approach LG TVs - particularly our Smart TV function which now has over 1,000 apps,' said Havis Kwon, president of LG Electronics. 'Talking' to the remote works like an internet search term - so it's ideal for finding shows quickly rather than browsing through a whole TV channel. Rumours flew that Apple itself would unveil iTV in January - either at CES or to coincide with it (which seems more likely given the electronics giant's usual reluctance to appear). LG at the Consumer Electronics Show in Last Vegas: Insiders expect several companies to unveil rivals to Apple's voice-controlled TV in January next year . Analyst Peter Misek at Jefferies predicted that the imminent launch of iTV would have rivals 'scrambling' and reluctant to be caught 'flat-footed.' So far, LG is the only manufacturer to have let details of its version slip - but many tech insiders suspect that voice control may be as ubiquitous at CES this year as 3D has been in previous years.","Speaking works like a 'search' function for shows .

"By . Lydia Warren . Last updated at 10:04 PM on 24th December 2011 . Another woman has come forward claiming she was abused by a celebrated Philadelphia sports columnist when she was a child. Former Philadelphia Daily News writer Bill Conlin retired just hours before accusations of him molesting children in the 1970s were published. Now an unidentified 59-year-old woman has told the Philadelphia Inquirer Conlin assaulted her at a beach in Margate, New Jersey when she was 11. Veteran: Bill Conlin, pictured at a National Baseball Hall of Fame event honouring him for his work, is accused of abusing seven children in the 1960s and 1970s . She said the incident happened in the . 1960s - a full decade before he allegedly abused the six other victims . who have stepped forward. She told the Inquirer - the paper . which first published the allegations - their accounts had empowered her to give her own. 'When I read it, I started to cry,' the mother-of-two from Chester County said. 'I just felt overwhelmed. The fact that I wasn't the only one made me feel stronger.' The latest alleged victim said Conlin, who was a family friend, assaulted her twice during his visits to her family's home. Stunned, she asked him not to touch her and the abuse ended after she told a lifeguard what had happened. Retired: Conlin had worked at the Daily News in Philadelphia since 1965 but immediately retired when the article accusing him of abuse was published . It comes just days after a sixth . accuser, Linda Stella, 50, told the Daily News that Conlin molested her . on two occasions at his New Jersey home. Conlin retired abruptly last Tuesday, shortly . before The Inquirer published a story online . detailing allegations of abuse from three women and a man in the 1970s. Bill Conlin, now 77, started his Daily News career in 1965, writing about college football, . professional boxing, baseball, the Olympics and tennis. He gained . notoriety as a commentator on the ESPN programme The Sports Reporters. He was the recipient of the 2011 JG . Taylor Spink Award, presented at the Baseball Hall of Fame in July, and . is honoured in the hall's 'Scribes and Mikemen' exhibit, along with . other celebrated writers. He is also the author of two baseball-related books, the Rutledge Book of Baseball and Batting Cleanup, Bill Conlin. On hearing of the first abuse accusations on December 20, he retired from the Daily News immediately, and his editor accepted. Conlin, who is a grandfather, married wife Irma in 1960 - before the abuse allegedly took place. Irma passed away in 2009. Prosecutors say Conlin cannot be charged because the statute of limitations has expired. He has denied the allegations. 'This has obviously been crushing to Mr. Conlin,' his lawyer George Bochetto told the Inquirer. 'Frankly, I am now more concerned about Mr. Conlin and his ability to carry on.' In the original article posted by the Inquirer, it said three women and a man claim they were molested as children by Conlin in the 1970s. One of them, Conlin's niece, was quoted by the Inquirer as saying: 'People have kept his secret. 'There were so many people who knew about this and did nothing,' she said. Conlin, 77, offered to retire, said Daily News editor Larry Platt at a news conference. 'I immediately accepted,' said Platt. 'It was a painful conversation.' According to the Inquirer, the four . adults said Conlin groped and fondled them and touched their genitals . when they were from ages seven to 12. A detective with the Gloucester, New . Jersey prosecutor's office said criminal charges . could not be pursued because assaults that occurred before 1996 fall . under the statute of limitations. 'We would love to see justice in this . case,' Detective Stacie Lick of the Prosecutor's Office wrote in an . e-mail to one of the women last month. Free: As the statute of limitations has expired, Conlin, now 77, . cannot be charged for any of the alleged child abuse crimes as they occurred too long ago . 'So many people have been . victimized by this man, but our hands are tied by the law, which does . not let us prosecute.' His niece told the Inquirer she and the others decided . to speak out after the child sex abuse scandal at Pennsylvania State . University brought back painful memories. At Penn State, former assistant . football coach Jerry Sandusky faces 52 counts of child sex abuse . stemming from accusations from ten adult men who say he abused them as . children. Oddly, as the Inquirer reports, Conlin questioned people who said they would have intervened had they seen the former Penn State assistant coach abusing a child in a recent column, 'Tough Guys Are Talking About Sandusky.' 'Everybody says he will do the right . thing, get involved, put his own ass on the line before or after the . fact,' he wrote. 'But the moment itself has a cruel way of suspending . our fearless intentions.'","Bill Conlin abruptly retired after 46 years when first accusations came out .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 1:00 PM on 23rd December 2011 . A cruel couple who were captured on tape forcing two little children aged under eight to have an armed fight have been jailed. Ian Barclay, 20, and Gemma Mattinson, 26, made the boy and girl brawl then laughed and cheered as the youngsters cried in pain and through fear. The shocking incident was captured on a mobile phone at a house in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, and showed the girl, wearing a pink dress, being ordered to kick, punch and hit the boy with a broom, which is much bigger than her. Jailed: Ian Barclay and Jemma Mattinson made the boy and girl, aged under eight, brawl as they laughed and cheered. Several people left the court as the video of the fight was played to the jury . Both children could be heard sobbing as the boy tried to hide behind a sofa but was dragged across the floor and banged into a radiator by Barclay. Several distressed people left the public gallery at Newcastle Crown Court in tears yesterday as the three-minute film was played. Prosecutor Glenda Turnbull told the court: 'The defendants encouraged the children to fight each other. 'They were both instructing the girl how to attack the boy, telling her what to do, bringing the children together, providing her with plastic sticks and a broom to use against him. 'The video footage is distressing, the children are crying.' Miss Turnbull said it is unclear what injuries the children suffered. Barclay can be heard shouting 'punch him, kick him, nut him' on the tape and the girl is given sticks and a broom to use as a weapons. When the children tried to separate they were pushed back together and goaded into fighting more, despite them screaming in terror. The pair were arrested when the person who taped the cruelty showed the footage to a relative of one of the children. Mattinson, from Gateshead, told police she didn’t realise what went on was 'quite as bad' until she saw the footage. Barclay, from Gateshead, said it was a 'joke that had gone too far'. Both of them admitted child cruelty charges and have previous convictions for violence, though not against children. Judge Roger Thorn jailed them both for eight months each. Jailed: Ian Barclay, 20, and Gemma Mattinson, 26, were given just eight months behind bars each by the judge at Newcastle Crown Court . He said: 'You put them up to fight each other as though they were toys in some Roman Amphitheatre for the sport of those watching. 'What happens beggars belief. There would be public outrage if this was not met with an immediate custodial sentence.' Judge Thorn said the footage caused 'revulsion' to decent minded people who had viewed it and said even he could not put into words what he had seen. The judge said: 'Words would fail to describe it. The distress of both children was apparent from watching that DVD.' The court heard Barclay’s family have disowned him because of what he did. Mattinson gave birth to a child on Saturday which has since been taken off her. Speaking after the hearing, the father of one of the children said he was outraged by the sentences. He said: 'The judge said he had to follow guidelines in relation to length of the sentences and I accept that but i think its time these guidelines were reviewed. 'To do what they did is just beyond belief. I couldn’t watch the video, I had to run out of court when it was played. 'My child went through all this and those two seemed to think it was funny. 'There should be some sort of register they have to sign so everybody knows what they have done and they dont get the chance to be near any children in future.'","Girl in pink dress is ordered to beat a boy with a broom which was bigger than her as the defendants laughed and cheered .

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 11:23 AM on 22nd December 2011 . A couple are celebrating Christmas with their baby daughter after she returned home from hospital just in time for the festivities. Jade Walsh, now nine months, was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer when she was just eight-weeks-old. Doctors operated to remove the tennis-ball sized growth in June. She has now finished a ten-week course of chemotherapy and has responded well to the treatment. First Christmas: Jade gets ready for festive fun with her mother Jacki . Her mother Jacki, 27, said: 'For the first time with the chemo I was really worried, I didn’t know if she’d feel it or if she’d be upset or if it was going to hurt her. But she was really good. 'The next day they said they were really pleased with the way she reacted and that we could go home, but that we’d have to come back every Monday. 'Doctors are really impressed with how Jade is doing and we’re nearly at the half way point.' Jade was born in March in England, after her father Ryan, 27, left the army so that the couple could move home from Germany to be nearer their families. However, during a routine check-up two months later, their GP referred her for further tests after saying one side of her stomach felt different from the other. Mrs Walsh said: 'We were referred to Bolton Hospital for an ultrasound scan and there they said they saw a mass on her kidney and that just hit me for six. 'I was crying walking out and all the way home.' Jade was booked in for the high-risk operation to remove the growth from her kidneys on June 2, when she was just 12-weeks-old. Brave: Jade is only nine months old but has already had a major operation and undergone months of chemotherapy . Mrs Walsh, from Bolton, said: 'It was horrendous, it was awful, I felt guilty for leaving her with the surgeons, just because there’s so many risks. 'It was right near a really important artery and I was just terrified. 'The operation was the longest three hours ever. Afterwards I just wanted to grab her but I couldn’t, she just had wires everywhere. I stayed with her there. We took her home about a week after the operation.' The biopsy confirmed Jade had Wilms' tumour and would need to undergo chemotherapy. Mrs Walsh said: 'This is every parent’s worst nightmare. 'After the chemo I think every three months they’ll just check her. We’ll just feel so relieved when it’s all over, we can just relax hopefully.' Jade's parents, family and friends, are now raising funds for the Manchester Royal Children’s Hospital which treated her. Jacki meanwhile hopes to become a children’s nurse one day. 'They’ve inspired me to train as a children’s nurse, they’re so fantastic,' she said. 'I want to go and help other children, it’s going to be a while before I can,but hopefully once Jade is better.'",Nine-month-old Jade diagnosed with Wilms' tumour when she was just eight weeks old .
"By . Lauren Paxman . Last updated at 4:39 PM on 20th December 2011 . The experimental drug appears capable of neutralising most - or even all - strains of the parasite responsible for nine out of 10 malaria deaths . A British vaccine with the potential to eradicate the most deadly form of malaria could enter clinical trials within two years. The experimental drug appears capable of neutralising most - or even all - strains of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which is responsible for nine out of 10 malaria deaths. It works in a unique way, effectively closing the molecular door that allows the organism to invade red blood cells. Targeting this 'Achilles' heel' thwarts the parasite's ability to dodge the immune system by evolving rapidly into new strains. The research is published today in the journal Nature Communications. Dr . Simon Draper, one of the scientists from the Jenner Institute at Oxford . University, said: 'So far we've been able to knock down every strain . we've been able to produce in the laboratory. That's why it's such an . incredibly exciting result. 'Normally vaccines don't work well because the parasite evolves into new strains the immune system does not recognise. 'If . this vaccine turns out to be highly effective in humans, as we hope, it . could be a serious contributor to an eradication programme.' So far the vaccine, known as PfRH5, has been tested in the laboratory and on rabbits. It was developed out of research reported last month in the journal Nature. Scientists at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, Cambridge, showed that P. falciparum killer parasite relies on a particular molecule, RH5, to gain access to red blood cells. The protein RH5 latches onto a specific 'receptor' molecule on the surface of blood cells which has the effect of 'unlocking' a gateway for the parasite. The new vaccine induces an immune response against RH5 to stop the lock turning and keep the door shut. Remarkably, people naturally exposed to malaria on repeated occasions have low or undetectable levels of antibodies that act against RH5. For this reason, the scientists believe, the parasite has not been under pressure to develop strains that avoid RH5 antibodies. 'It's a bit of a mystery,' said Dr Draper. 'There are 5,000 proteins in the malaria parasite but the immune system normally ignores RH5. 'For many decades people have looked at how people develop natural immunity to malaria and said that's what we should base our vaccines on. With the best of intentions they may have been looking in the wrong place.' Malaria is often spread by infected mosquitos which inject parasites into the bloodstream . Malaria is a tropical disease spread by night-biting mosquitoes. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there were 243 million cases and nearly 1 million deaths from malaria in 2008. Most deaths occur in African countries close to the equator and below the Sahara desert (Sub-Saharan Africa). Many babies and children die from malaria. WHO estimates that a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds. When a mosquito infected with malaria parasites (plasmodia) bites you, it injects the parasites into your body. It only takes a single mosquito bite for you to become infected. Any type of malaria is dangerous but malaria caused by the falciparum parasite is the most serious. It can develop very rapidly and lead to severe illness and death. The only other malaria vaccine at an advanced stage of development targets the parasite in the liver. Although  currently undergoing clinical trials, it is only 30 per cent to 50 per cent effective, said Dr Draper. He said his team was now urgently looking for funding to progress to patient trials with their vaccine. With around £1 million, clinical trials could begin in as little as two years. 'We're all ready to go. We can fly once we've got the money,' Dr Draper added. The vaccine is injected using a harmless modified virus. After an early safety trial involving healthy volunteers in the UK, the main trials would take place in Africa. Co-author Dr Sandy Douglas, a Wellcome Trust Clinical Training Fellow from Oxford University, said: 'We have created a vaccine that confirms the recent discovery relating to the biology of RH5, given it can generate an immune response in animal models capable of neutralising many - and potentially all - strains of the P. falciparum parasite, the deadliest species of malaria parasite. 'This is an important step towards developing a much-needed vaccine against one of the world's major killers.' Professor Adrian Hill, a Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator at Oxford University, said: 'Vaccines against malaria are notoriously difficult to develop because the parasites' antigens - the target of vaccines - tend to be genetically so diverse. The RH5 antigen doesn't show this diversity, making it a particularly good target for a vaccine to exploit. 'Our next step will be to begin safety tests of this vaccine. If these prove successful, we could see clinical trials in patients beginning within the next two to three years.' The vaccine would only be effective against P. falciparum, because other species of the parasite do not employ RH5, said Dr Draper.","Oxford scientists need to raise £1million, but hope to get the vaccine to trial within two years ."

A new mother says she was left in . blood-stained sheets for three days and given no food for 24 hours after having a caesarean section. Elspeth Kirk, 29, said the birth of her first child Ava turned into a . nightmare as desperately overstretched hospital staff struggled to cope. Mrs Kirk, a teacher from Westcliff, . Essex, was admitted to Southend Hospital in Essex on Wednesday, December 7 and had a caesarean . section the following morning. She was moved to a recovery ward for two and a half hours before being moved again to a post-natal ward where her troubles began. Elspeth Kirk with her baby Ava and husband Dean: She said her experience following her caesarean had been awful due to maternity staff shortages . She said: 'I couldn't move because of the . epidural anaesthetic I had so they came to give me a bedbath but then . just gave me a cloth and told me to wipe under my arms then took the . bowl away.' Mrs Kirk was keen to have a meal as she hadn't eaten since having lunch on Tuesday just before her labour started. She said: 'Someone brought around the tea trolley. I asked if I could have something to eat and the woman said she would get back to me. She never came back. 'I kept asking people if I could eat but they were all so busy. They all said they would go and find out but they never did. 'I just gave up in the end - I had gone past the point of hunger.' Mrs Kirk was eventually given a cup of tea and two slices of bread and jam at 10.30am on Thursday. 'The nurse who listened to my bowels said I should really have had food the previous night,' the new mother said. She added that she struggled to breastfeed her daughter as there was no-one available to guide her. When she was finally allowed out of bed, three days after the caesarean section, the sheets were covered in dried blood. 'The nurse looked quite horrified,' Mrs Kirk said. Her . husband, Dean, 32, said two other new mothers were so disgusted that . they discharged themselves from the ward. Mrs . Kirk, who works at a special school in Leigh, Essex, said her bloodied sheets . were not changed for three days, while the DVT . tights she was given to wear to prevent thrombosis turned  black . because the floor was so filthy. Despite their ordeal, the couple have nothing but praise for the medical staff who they say were desperately overstretched. Elspeth Kirk had a caesarean section at Southend Hospital.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:21 PM on 23rd December 2011 . Scores of people were injured yesterday when the New Zealand city of Christchurch was rocked by an earthquake. The tremor – the third in just over a year – came ten months after a massive quake struck the city killing 182 people. People ran into the streets when yesterday’s 5.8 magnitude quake caused buildings to sway shortly before lunchtime. Aftershocks: As dust rises from rocks, people in Christchurch experienced four violent aftershocks . Off road: Cars in Christchurch became stuck in huge pot holes caused by the quake . Under water: The Burwood and New Brighton areas of Christchurch pictured shortly after the earthquake . Roads cracked open and liquid gushed up from the sandy ground on which much of the city lies. A Qantas jet bound for Christchurch had to be diverted. Experts predict earthquakes will continue to hit New Zealand’s second city for the next four years. One in ten residents is preparing to leave as it becomes increasingly difficult to rebuild. Christchurch, the largest city on South Island, has a population of around 367,000. Amy Adams, associate minister for earthquake recovery, was among those shaken by the quake. She said: ‘It was  bad enough to have us diving under tables and grabbing each other. It’s not what anyone needs at the end of a stressful year.’ It was not immediately known if anyone had died - but one person was injured at a city mall, four people were rescued after being trapped by a rock fall and 60 were treated for minor injuries. Yesterday's quake comes just 10 months after February's magnitude-6.3 - in almost the same spot - killed 182 people and crippled large areas. In September 2010 the area was hit by a magnitude-7.1. The city is still struggling to reconstruct the hundreds of buildings damaged in both of the disasters, with every major aftershock creating months of additional delays because of its impact on global re-insurers who stand behind New Zealand's insurance firms. Aftermath: Darryl Freeman shovels liquefaction from the front of his Christchurch home which was struck by the earthquake . Holes in the ground: Liquefaction is seen seeping out of roads across Christchurch . Devastation: A seismograph shows the effect of the Christchurch earthquake . They have suffered huge losses because of the quakes, which has also wiped out the country's $6 billion Earthquake Commission insurance fund. ANZ national chief economist Cameron Bagrie said his organisation had predicted after the September 2010 quake that the city could lose as much as five per cent of its population, . New Zealand is dissected by the tectonic plate boundary between the Pacific Plate and the Australia-India Plate. The plate boundary is east of the North Island and crosses to the west of the South Island. Christchurch . is not on the plate boundary, but is near to related secondary faults . that result from the bend in the plate boundary to the north. University . of Melbourne's principal research fellow at the School of Earth . Sciences Dr Gary Gibson told Perthnow.com: 'In the past 200 years and in . the long term, large earthquakes will occur less frequently in . Christchurch than along the plate boundary. 'However . all earthquakes in the Christchurch region will be shallow, so the . effect of a given earthquake will be worse than from a deeper plate . boundary earthquake of the same magnitude. 'New Zealand is more prone to earthquakes because it is on the plate boundary and has many plate boundary earthquakes.' But he told BusinessDesk that could now be a 'pessimistic' prediction. He said: 'It could be, from today, that was being conservative. Now, looking at Christchurch, that five per cent seems too light and you could be up to 10 per cent. 'That has massive consequences for infrastructure, networking, the whole capability of the city.' In yesterday's quake, fire engines, ambulances and police cars raced through the city to check on damage and casualties as people were asked not to use their mobile phones to keep emergency airwaves open. Shoppers ran from supermarkets as goods crashed from shelves. Some people received injuries as they fled to the safety of streets. More than 26,000 homes were left without power after the shaking tripped switches, cutting supplies. The first 5.8-magnitude quake struck on Friday afternoon, local time, 16 miles north of Christchurch and 2.5 miles deep, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Minutes later, a 5.3-magnitude aftershock hit. About an hour after that, the city was shaken by another 5.8-magnitude temblor, the USGS said, though New Zealand's geological agency GNS Science recorded it as 6.0. Both aftershocks were less than three miles deep and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre did not issue an alert. The earthquake was felt as far north as Wellington and Dunedin in the south. Actress Robyn Malcolm tweeted: 'F**k, that was terrifying.' Film-maker Logan McMillan said: 'The noises that come with it…it starts with a little shake before it hits in. 'I have friends down at the mall and they said there was stuff falling off the shelves and ceiling panels falling in. 'Everyone is evacuating. There's a bit of panic. They said it's chaos down there.' Residents said serious thought would now have to be given as to whether the entire city should be abandoned for good, claiming the risks are too high and its future too uncertain. Evacuation: Although most of the buildings in Christchurch were evacuated cars became trapped in sinkholes after the quake . Second clean up: Daniel Marsh and Jason Myburgh clean up liquefaction from Chadbury Street in Parklands . Broken banks: Government officials survey a collapsed bank and broken . water line on the banks of the Avon River in Christchurch after the . quake . Experts have predicted earthquakes will continue to hit the area for the next four years. Many residents said insuring anything in Christchurch had become a 'nightmare' and it was not 'worth their while' to live there any more. Callers flooded radio stations to tell of their individual scares. One caller to Newstalke ZB said the quake was 'as vicious' as the one in February. 'The first thing I felt was a little movement and I said ""What's this?"" and I said to my wife ""Get under a door frame somewhere safe"". I just dived under the bench,' said the caller. Reporter Jo Scott said: 'It's absolutely frightening. My children are literally shaking and sobbing in my arms. That's the worst bit. But we're tough and we have a strong house and we'll be OK.' But many residents said they were preparing for a follow-up quake or aftershocks which could be equally damaging. Social media users told of their fears and how they were fed up with the quakes hitting the city. 'We knows, after a big one, that there are weeks and months of aftershocks ahead and that's what makes it so hard to bear,' wrote one person. 'Still in the car, trying to get home,' wrote one man. 'Police cars and ambulances rushing past.' The desire to live in other areas was also apparent among many. 'If only we can relocate Christchurch somewhere else,' said one man. Seismologist Ken Gledhill said the quake was further from the city than most of the previous aftershocks, but it followed the same pattern. Smash:The 5.8 magnitude quake swayed buildings in the city causing shop damage but no injuries . Clean up operation: Staff at a Christchurch supermarket mop up smashed wine bottles . 'It's likely there will be a series of aftershocks which will gradually drop off,' he said. Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker, who featured strongly after the February quake with regular updates for the rest of the world, was on holiday at Lake Taupo, on the North Island when he was told about the quake. 'I'm desperately trying to get back home - I'll be there later today. But it's going toe one hell of a day.' he said. Police said all the shopping malls had been closed and patrols were searching the streets for damage.

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 3:16 PM on 22nd December 2011 . A jealous lover who tortured a love rival to death with a hot poker for sleeping with his girlfriend while he was in prison has been jailed for at least 30 years. Gary Speight, 31, beat Anthony Bates with a broom handle, stabbed him in the neck with an apple skewer and poured molten syrup over his head. In what senior prosecutors described as one of the most chilling cases they have heard, Mr Bates was branded with the poker as Blondie’s ‘One Way or Another’ played in the background. Gary Speight (left) and Dean Swift (right), tortured Anthony Bates to death with 'sadistic pleasure'. They have both been jailed for life . He was also stamped on until his skull fractured and had his kneecaps broken. Audio from the horrific attack was . taped on an iPhone by a workman standing outside the flat, and Mr Bates can . be heard groaning as he is told: ‘Get up or you are going to die.’ By that stage Mr Bates was so brain damaged he was unable to stand. Speight later bragged to friends that he planned to chop up the body and throw the pieces in the Thames. His victim’s mutilated body was . discovered by police in the blood-spattered kitchen of a flat in . Vauxhall, South London, in the early hours of February 1. Speight was convicted of murder by a unanimous verdict following a five-week trial at the Old Bailey. Accomplice Dean Swift, 44, was . convicted by a majority of 10 to two. He was also jailed for life and . given a minimum term of 28 years. Judge Charles Byers said: ‘It was a brutal and . callous murder, carried out over the long period of a day. ‘I am sure that Anthony Bates died in exquisite pain and I am quite satisfied that you tortured him with a sadistic pleasure. ‘You tried to stick a hot poker up him, and although you failed you still branded him. Jailed: Speight and Swift were both sentenced at the Old Bailey to life in prison . ‘There was a clear element of sadism, and use of multiple weapons, as he was beaten, punched, kicked, and assaulted him. ‘You also poured hot syrup, boiled in a kettle to 150 degree over him. ‘You Gary Speight, when in drink are a . reckless and dangerous bully, and that you Dean Swift are a depraved . human being who remarked to a witness “that you really enjoyed it.” ‘You showed him no compassion, and . when the thought of calling an ambulance crossed you minds, Gary Speight . you prevented it for your own selfish reasons. ‘You left him on his own in pain, to die. Anyone who heard that tape will be affected by it for years to come.' Swift’s girlfriend Corina Lowe, 28, earlier broke down in tears as she was cleared of murder. Jurors heard that Mr Bates, who had . dated Speight’s girlfriend Laura O’Shaughnessy for up to six months . before he was killed, was lured to the flat in Vauxhall on January 31. At 11am that day, Speight texted her: ‘Do you want Tony to live ring me.’ Over the coming hours, Speight was joined by Swift and others as they launched their relentless assault. A post-mortem report later showed Mr . Bates had suffered a series of bone fractures including a shattered . kneecap, and a brain injury. Some of the attack was recorded on an . iPhone from a communal corridor by workman Lee Farrow, who was removing . asbestos from the building. In the recording, witness Ozell Buntin can be heard yelling: ‘No Gary, you’re going to kill him. ‘Please don’t hit him no more man, that’s enough... you’re gonna kill him like that, seriously!’ A voice, said to be Speight, can later be heard announcing: ‘He can die there. I’ll chop him up.’ Buntin, who has since died, told . police that Speight later called him and asked for his help to ‘chop’ up . the body and throw the pieces in the Thames, and told him to bring . petrol so they could burn down the block of flats. Officers were eventually led to the flat after William Furlong, one of Speight’s friends, reported the murder to police.","Builder recorded audio from the horrific attack on his iPhone .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 1:32 AM on 24th December 2011 . The mother of a 20-month-ld girl who went missing from a house in Waterville, Maine, says she blames the toddler's father for her disappearance. Trista Reyonolds says Justin DiPietro should have protected little Ayla Reyonolds. Mr DiPietro told police his daughter disappeared after he put her to bed in her crib last Friday night . Teams of investigators are stepping up their focus on the house where Ayla went missing seven days ago as they used cadaver dogs to search local fields, streams and waterways. Police are following up more than 200 tips from the public on Ayla - while police, firefighters, game wardens, marine patrol officers and civilian volunteers have joined the search effort. Toddler: Ayla Reynolds, of Waterville, Maine, was reported missing from her bed on Saturday morning by her father Justin DiPietro, who told police he last saw her when he put her to bed the previous night . 'I trusted him to keep her safe,' Miss Reynolds told the Today Show. 'And now she is missing and I don't know where she is. I blame him right now. He did not protect her the way he was supposed to.' Ayla was living with Mr DiPietro after state social services removed her from Miss Reynolds care because of substance abuse problems, the Today Show reported. Miss Reynolds told the program she is a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for three months. She said she filed court documents seeking sole custody of her daughter the day before she went missing. Blames father: Trista Reynolds, little Ayla's mother, said the girl's father should have protected her . Removed: Trista, a recovering alcoholic, said state officials removed Ayla from her care while she went into rehabilitation . Investigators put up crime-scene tape around Ayla's house, called two of the state's top homicide prosecutors to the site on Thursday and brought a state police support van to the scene. ‘That is the last place Ayla was seen,’ Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey said. ‘So as you might expect, we're going to give a lot of attention to that particular house. ‘(We’re) looking for any clues where she might be or where it would help us to locate her. We need to go through that as thoroughly as we can, just like we do in any other investigation.’ Chief Massey insisted that although the toddler's disappearance remains a missing child case, ‘everything remains open and we're not discounting anything.’ Father: Justin DiPietro, left, told police he last saw Ayla, right, when he put her to bed last Friday night. He said she was wearing green pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them . My mom: Ayla, right, ended up with her father after child welfare workers intervened while her mother, Trista Reynolds, left, checked into a 10-day rehab programme . He said officials from the state attorney general's office, including criminal division chief William Stokes, were at the house, but that was just to give them an opportunity to look at the site. 'That is the last place Ayla was seen. So as you might expect, we're going to give a lot of attention to that particular house' Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey . ‘We're at a point where we thought it was appropriate for him to come in and just do a walk-through,’ Chief Massey said. ‘We're just at a different point in the investigation.’ An attorney general spokesman said the visit to Ayla's father's home by Chief Stokes and Andrew Benson, another top homicide prosecutor, was ‘standard protocol’. The police chief played down the significance of yellow tape strung about the perimeter of the small property, saying it was ‘just an additional barrier’ to secure the site. He said people should not read too much . into the presence of a state police incident command van parked there, . saying it was for the convenience of technicians working at the site. Sadness: Isaiah Vear, 5, of Waterville, Maine, leaves a memorial after placing a toy for missing 20-month-old Ayla Reynolds outside the toddler's home on Thursday in Waterville . Address: Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey, at the podium, speaks to members of the media regarding the investigation into the disappearance of 20 month-old Ayla Reynolds at a conference in Waterville, Maine . The investigation continued in other parts of the central Maine city, including at the airport where cadaver dogs were brought in, as well as streams and waterways. Mr DiPietro told police he last saw Ayla . when he put her to bed last Friday night. He said she was wearing green . pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them. 'There are a lot of things that we've eliminated, and that's just as important as identifying things' Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey . 'I have no idea what happened to Ayla, or . who is responsible,' he said. 'I will not make accusations or . insinuations towards anyone until the police have been able to prove . who's responsible for this.' She also had a soft cast on her broken left arm. Ayla ended up with her father after child welfare workers intervened while her mother, Trista Reynolds, checked into a 10-day rehab programme. The case drew expressions of community support and hope the child will be found safe as more than 60 people, many of them mothers, gathered at a local church on Wednesday for a candlelight vigil. Chief Massey said police have made ‘significant progress’ although Ayla has not been found. ‘There are a lot of things that we've eliminated, and that's just as important as identifying things,’ he said.","Ayla Reynolds reported missing from Waterville, Maine, home last Saturday .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 10:01 AM on 22nd December 2011 . Scottish independence: Sir Gus O'Donnell warned today the Union could break up in the next few years . Britain could break up within years and Scotland could become an independent nation again, the country's most senior civil servant today acknowledged for the first time. Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell said that whether the union could be maintained would be a major political issue in the years to come. Alex Salmond, the Scottish First Minister, has vowed to hold a referendum on independence before 2016. The SNP won a majority at Holyrood for the first time raising the spectre of the break-up of Britain. Although David Cameron has pledged to keep the union together, Sir Gus wrote in a wide-ranging newspaper article today that it will be a big political issue in the years to come. Critics think it is is unlikely a majority of Scots would vote for independence. However, the devolved Scottish government could be given additional law-making powers. Sir Gus's remarks come before he retires at the end of the year. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Sir Gus said: 'Over the next few years, there will be enormous challenges, such as whether to keep our kingdom united.' This morning Alex Salmond said that the civil servant was right to raise the constitutional issue and said he wanted to 'win the fight' for independence. He said: 'I have always regarded Sir Gus O'Donnell as a model civil servant, who has been extremely fair in recognising and respecting the democratic mandate of the Scottish Government. 'Sir Gus is right to recognise the importance of the constitutional issue, and the SNP Government are up for the challenge of building and winning the case for Scottish independence - unlike the Westminster parties, who seem to have their heads buried in the sand.' Scotland has been united with England since the Act of Union in 1707. However, after Tony Blair devolved law-making powers to Scotland following a referendum, calls for independence have grown. Independence for Scotland? The modern Scottish Parliament was created by Tony Blair. After the SNP became the main party in a minority government in 2007, the issue of independence came back on the agenda . MPs representing Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland can all vote for laws that only apply in England. However, English MPs do not have the same power over the other countries within the union. It has been argued that following devolution only English MPs should vote on laws that only apply to England. Although power was devolved more than a decade ago the issue has never been resolved. Scottish MPs currently hold 59 out of 650 seats in the House of Commons. The question got its name because the issue was first raised by Tom Dalyell, the West Lothian MP, when devolution was being discussed in 1977. Critics warned at the time that once the Scots had their own parliament it would put Britain on a slippery slope towards break-up. In the years ahead, MPs at Westminster must also tackle the West Lothian Question. Scottish MPs can vote on education and health laws at Westminster but English MPs do not have the same powers over Scotland. A commission has been set up to find a solution to the constitutional anomaly. As well as tackling the issue of . whether the UK will break up, Sir Gus wrote in his piece today that the . Civil Service needed to overcome its 'cultural inertia' and take a . leading role in driving economic recovery. 'It is not enough now for the Civil Service simply to respond to a dampened economic climate: it needs to become a central part of its recovery and growth,' he wrote. Sir Gus also said he believed successive governments had been too quick to address problems with regulation and legislation. Devolution: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair gave Scotland its own parliament again . He encouraged ministers and civil servants to be more creative in solving problems, urging them to take more risks and have a 'grown-up approach to failure'. He said civil servants had risen to a challenge set out by the Prime Minister to do away with unnecessary regulations, having recommended scrapping more than half of the 1,200 rules they had looked at so far. Sir Gus also wrote of his pride over . the 'thorough, evidence-based analysis' carried out under the last . government, which resulted in Britain staying out of the euro. 'Without that, the challenge would be substantially greater,' he added. He listed keeping Britain out of the euro against the wishes of Tony Blair as one of his proudest achievements. Earlier, . in an interview for Channel 4 News, Sir Gus disclosed that Whitehall . had carried out contingency planning in case the coalition breaks up - . although he said he believed it would run its full course to 2015. 'My . reading of the coalition, the relationship between the Prime Minister . and the Deputy Prime Minister, is that is probably when the next . election will be,' he said. 'You have to do contingency planning, but I think our main scenario is that we go through to 2015.' Scotland has been united with the rest of Britain since the Act of Union in 1707 - but could become independent again within years. At the moment it is considered unlikely that a majority of Scottish people would vote for the country to go it alone in the world again. However, the issue has entered the political agenda for the first time in a generation after Labour gave Scotland a devolved government in 1999. After oil was discovered in the North Sea in the 1970s, nationalists begun calling for independence and came a whisker away from achieving devolution. A referendum was held on giving Scotland its own assembly in March 1979 but it was rejected on a technicality. Although 52 per cent of people voted in favour of devolution, fewer than 40 per cent of Scots voted amid widespread apathy. The issue went off the agenda for a generation until Labour came to power in 1997. It held a new referendum north of the border, and 74.3 per cent of people this time voted for a Scottish Parliament. There was also devolution to Wales and Ireland. Critics argued that by giving Scotland the power to make its own laws, it would put Britain on a slippery slope to break-up. Although the Labour Party dominated the Scottish Parliament in the early years, the SNP became the largest party in 2007. They then won a majority for the first time in May this year. First Minister Alex Salmond has promised a referendum on independence before 2016. Battle: First Minister Alex Salmond has vowed to hold a referendum on Scottish independence by 2016 .

"Crossroads GPS spent $1.1million on one spot . casting Warren as aligned with radical elements of the Occupy Wall . Street movement . Another that has her siding with Wall Street . bankers . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:59 AM on 27th December 2011 . Watch the political advertising and Elizabeth Warren, the leading Democratic Senate candidate in Massachusetts, either 'sides with extreme left' protesters or has a history of being too cosy with Wall Street. That is the criticism spewing from political activists behind conservative Crossroads GPS, which has ties to former President George W Bush's former top adviser Karl Rove. Outside groups on both sides are spending millions of dollars on the race, highlighting the national prominence of the fight between Warren and freshman GOP Senator Scott Brown for the seat held for nearly 50 years by the late Senator Edward M Kennedy. Scroll down for video . Attack: Last month, an ad by political advocacy group Crossroads accused Elizabeth Warren of siding 'with extreme left' groups such as Occupy Wall Street . But the level of spending also . foreshadows the role that such groups, including special political . action committees, will play in many of next fall's big political . matchups. The flood of money and ads from outside the state is expected to surge as the Warren-Brown race intensifies, according to Ken . Goldstein, president of Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks . spending on political ads. 'Massachusetts is at the end of the . spear of what will be the big trend and the big story of 2012,' Mr Goldstein said. Super PACs have been showing their . strength in marquis Senate races. The Supreme Court, in a trio of . decisions capped by the landmark Citizens United case in 2010, eased . restrictions on the use of corporate money in political campaigns and . paved the way for such spending. Massachusetts is front and centre, with . the conservative Crossroads GPS spending $1.1million on one spot . casting Warren as aligned with radical elements of the Occupy Wall . Street movement and another that has her siding with Wall Street . bankers. Under fire: A second Crossroads ad painted Warren as being too cozy with Wall Street when she oversaw the Treasury's handling of the financial industry bailout . Criticism: The Crossroads ads painted Warren as pro big government . Crossroads GPS is an affiliate of . American Crossroads, a group with ties to Rove. The groups spent more than $38 . million to defeat Democrats in the 2010 midterms, raising money from . large donors, including many whose identities remain unknown. Crossroads GPS was by far the largest and most influential super PAC in that campaign year. Last month, one Crossroads ad used . spliced images of Warren with rowdy Occupy Wall Street protesters to . claim that she 'sides with extreme left' protesters who 'attack police, . do drugs and trash public parks.' Warren at one point said her . philosophies provided the intellectual underpinnings for the Occupy . movement, but she has backed off a bit, saying she supports the movement . but that the protesters must follow the law. A second Crossroads ad then painted . Warren as being too cozy with Wall Street when she headed a . congressional panel that oversaw the Treasury's handling of the $700 . billion financial industry bailout, a charge Warren has dismissed as . ridiculous given her background as a consumer advocate and leading . critic of many Wall Street's practices. Connection: Crossroads GPS is an affiliate of American Crossroads, a group with ties to Karl Rove, a top political adviser to President George W Bush . The attacks prompted Warren to spend . about $1million on her first TV campaign ad, in which she says: 'Before . you hear a bunch of ridiculous attack ads, I want to tell you who I am.' Warren is an especially inviting . target for Republicans because many voters don't know much about her, . which Anthony Corrado, a campaign finance expert at Colby College in . Maine, said explains why these groups have become active at such an . early stage of the campaign. 'The first information can often have a powerful influence,' he said. Outside groups have also gone after Brown. Not unscathed: Freshman GOP Senator Scott Brown, whom Warren hopes to defeat next year, is portrayed as an enemy of the environment . The League of Conservation Voters and . the League of Women Voters have spent nearly $3million on separate ad . campaigns accusing Brown of casting anti-environmental votes. Both . groups have also run ads against Democrats in other states. The League of Women Voters' ad rapped . Brown for voting with other Senate Republicans to ban the Environmental . Protection Agency from controlling gases blamed for global warming. It . showed a child breathing through an oxygen mask and urged Brown to . 'protect the people and not the polluters.' Brown complained that the ad . was 'political demagoguery.' One spot by the League of . Conservation Voters slammed Brown for siding with 'big oil' and voting . 'repeatedly against protecting our environment and public health.' He . has denounced that ad as a distortion. The League of Conservation Voters said Brown scored a zero on the group's national environmental report card. The early wave of attack ads has hurt . both candidates, a recent University of Massachusetts-Lowell/Boston . Herald poll found. The percentage of voters who said they had an . unfavourable view of Brown rose from 29 per cent to 35 per cent between . late September and early December. Those viewing Warren unfavourably . increased from 18 per cent to 27 per cent. Brown wants third-party groups to . pull their negative commercials. Warren draws the line at unfair attack . ads but defends the rights of political action committees and other . independent groups to run ads. Such talk won't stop outside groups from swarming the airwaves with negative ads, however. 'This is just a harbinger of things to come,' said Corrado.

Iran is threatening to close off the world's most important oil shipping lane as tensions between it and the West mount following the capture of an unmanned American spy plane. Parviz Sarvari, a member of the Iranian parliament's National Security Committee, said his country was preparing to close off the crucial Strait of Hormuz as part of a military exercise. Around a third of all shipped oil passes through the four mile-wide Strait between Oman and Iran and U.S. warships patrol the area to ensure safe passage. Threat: An Iranian politician claims the country's military is preparing to close off the Strait of Hormuz - the most important oil transport channel in the world . Most of the crude exported from Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq - together with nearly all the liquefied natural gas from lead exporter Qatar is transported through the channel. Mr Sarvari told the Iranian student news agency ISNA: 'Soon we will hold a military manoeuvre on how to close the Strait of Hormuz. If the world wants to make the region insecure, we will make the world insecure.' Parviz Sarvari, a member of the Iranian parliament's National Security Committee, said Iran was preparing to close off the Strait as part of an exercise . After a news agency mistakenly reported the straight had already been closed, crude oil prices leapt by almost $2 to $100.45/per barrel, but they later stabilised. Last month, Iran's energy minister told Al Jazeera that Tehran could use oil as a political tool in the event of any future conflict over its nuclear program. Tensions over the program have increased since the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on November 8 that Tehran appears to have worked on designing a nuclear bomb and may still be pursuing research to that end. Iran strongly denies this and says it is developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Iran has warned it will respond to any attack by hitting Israel and U.S. interests in the Gulf and analysts say one way to retaliate would be to close the Strait of Hormuz. Yesterday former U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney said President Obama should have ordered an airstrike over Iran after their refusal to hand back the unmanned spyplane that crashed last week. During a White House news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Mr Obama said: 'We have asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond.' But Mr Cheney told CNN: 'The right response would have been to go in immediately after it had gone down and destroy it. Important: Around a third of the world's shipped oil passes through the Strait . 'You can do that from the air and, in effect, make it impossible for them to benefit from having captured that drone, but [Obama] asked nicely for them to return it, and they aren't going to.' Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . said he had not intention of returning the RQ-170 Sentinel high-altitude . reconnaissance drone. Mr Cheney added that the Iranians will likely send the drone back 'in pieces after they’ve gotten all the intelligence they can out of it.' Interviewed on Venezuelan television last . night, President Ahmadinejad said: 'There are people here who have been . able to control this spy plane, who can surely analyse this plane's . system also. Former U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney said President Obama should have . ordered an airstrike over Iran after their refusal to hand back the . unmanned spy plane that crashed last week . 'The Americans have perhaps decided to give us this spy plane. We now have control of this plane.' Mr Obama refused to comment on what the Iranians might learn from studying the drone. U.S. officials say Iran had nothing to do with the drone crashing to earth and claim it simply malfunctioned. General Hossein Salami, deputy head of . Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard, said on state television that the . violation of Iran's airspace by the U.S. drone was a 'hostile act' and . warned of a 'bigger' response. Officials . in Iran even believe they can 'mass produce' the captured bat-winged . stealthy RQ-170 Sentinel and build a 'superior' version following its . crash on December 4. Parviz . Sorouri, the head of Iran's parliamentary national security committee, . said today: 'Our next action will be to reverse-engineer the aircraft. 'In . the near future, we will be able to mass produce it ... Iranian . engineers will soon build an aircraft superior to the American using . reverse engineering.' It also emerged today that Iran has . lodged a complaint with Interpol following calls made during U.S. congressional hearings to assassinate members of Tehran’s security . agency. Former U.S. Army . Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Jack Keane and former CIA operative Reuel Marc . Gerecht, now a senior fellow for the Foundation for Defense of . Democracies, told the subcommittee hearing on 'Iranian Terror Operations . on American Soil,' that they were in favour of carrying out covert . operations against members of Qods, a special unit of Iran's . Revolutionary Guard. In his . speech, Keane suggested sanctions against Tehran were not sufficient and . suggested cyberattacks, covert actions and assassination would be more . effective. He told the . hearing: 'Why are we permitting the Qods Force leaders, who have been . organizing this killing of us for 30 years, to go around, still walking . around? 'Why don’t we kill . them? We kill other people who are running terrorist organizations . against the United States. These guys have killed almost a thousand of . us. Why don’t we kill them?' And Gerecht said: 'Iran would not look like the country it is today if they were concerned about the bottom line. Boast: Officials . in Iran claim they can 'mass produce' the captured RQ-170 Sentinel drone and build a 'superior' version following its . crash on December 4 . 'So I don’t think that you’re going to really intimidate these people, get their attention, unless you shoot somebody – it’s pretty blunt, but I don’t think you get to get around it.' Iran’s national prosecutor general, Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejei told Iranian television that a case had been opened and that the judiciary was 'providing more documents to the Interpol, so that the two Americans, who have threatened the Iranian commander with assassination, would be prosecuted.' The hearing, which took place on October 26, was held in response to an alleged plot by Qods to assassinate of the Saudi ambassador in Washington and carry out a string of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Qods' commander General Ghasem Soleimani has been accused of numerous covert terrorist activities, including helping Shi’ite militias carry out attacks on U.S. and British troops in Iraq. Gerecht told the hearing: 'Ghasem Soleimani travels a lot, he’s all over the place. 'Go get him. Either try to capture him, or kill him. I think you have to send a pretty powerful message to those who have undertaken this, or I think down the road you’re asking for it. They will read this not as a response of someone who’s strong, but as a response of someone who’s weak.' Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi claims the remarks were part of a 'devilish triangle of terrorism, human rights violation and use of WMDs' by the U.S..' The Iranians have also highlighted a letter to President Obama from House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Peter King and two subcommittee chairs urging  'significant covert action against the Iranian regime, including against facilities and personnel responsible for killing our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.'","Four mile-wide strait is world's most important oil shipping lane .

The Duke of Edinburgh was said to be in ‘good spirits’ yesterday despite facing his fourth night in hospital following emergency heart surgery. As the Daily Mail revealed yesterday, Prince Philip has been urging doctors to release him as soon as possible and, according to one senior royal source, has been in ‘genuinely good form’. But senior medics at Papworth Hospital, in Cambridgeshire, are said to be taking no chances with the 90-year-old royal’s health and decided to keep him under observation for another night. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘The Duke of Edinburgh continues to make good progress from the procedure. 'He remains in hospital under observation and in good spirits.’ The Queen, who remains at Sandringham, her private Norfolk estate, is being kept  informed about her husband’s progress. Other royals went ahead yesterday with their traditional Boxing Day pheasant shoot – normally organised by crack shot Philip – at his request. The senior royal began experiencing severe chest pains on Friday night and was airlifted to Papworth’s specialist cardiothoracic unit for surgery on a blocked artery. His wife, children and grandchildren have all been to see him, although it is believed the duke did not receive any family visitors yesterday. Dressed to impress: At her first Royal Christmas . the Duchess of Cambridge looked elegant in a simple maroon outfit by a . British designer, while the Queen wore a lavender coat with a glittering . diamond and pearl brooch . On the way to the church: (Left to right) Prince Andrew, Prince William, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Charles, Prince Harry, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall made their way to the service while Prince Philip recovered . Plum centre of attention Kate, flanked by William and Harry on either side, in her striking Jane Corbett hat . The irascible royal hates fuss and . when he was hospitalised for four days with a chest infection in 2008 he . refused to receive any well-wishers, instead catching up on his . paperwork. Although it is expected that the duke . will  make a full recovery from his ordeal, questions were being asked . yesterday as to whether he would be able to continue with his busy . schedule of public engagements when he and the Queen return to work from . their Christmas break in early February. Despite his age, Philip still . undertakes around 350 engagements a year and in 2011 undertook two . gruelling foreign tours with his wife – to Australia and Ireland. Next year sees the worldwide . celebration of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. She and her husband are due . to undertake a comprehensive tour of the UK to mark the occasion. Surrounded! Catherine happily chatted as the public swarmed to meet Prince William's stunning wife . Meeting Catherine at Christmas: The crowds were thrilled to greet the Duchess . Brotherly love: Prince William and Prince Harry spoke to public who clustered around the church . ‘It’s just too early to say what will happen,’ a source told the Mail yesterday. ‘Inevitably the duke will want it to be business as usual but he may have no choice but to slow down.’ Meanwhile the Duchess of Cambridge continues to enjoy her first Christmas as a royal. All eyes were on Kate as she attended . church at Sandringham for the first time on Christmas morning – and as . always, critics were poring over her choice of outfit. She won praise for the eye-catching, plum made-to-measure Jane Corbett hat she wore for the occasion. Delighting the crowds: Catherine accepts some flowers from a young girl .

First Christmas as a married couple: Prince William escorted his stunning wife to the church . And although the newly-married . duchess has her pick of priceless jewels to choose from as a female . member of the royal family, she opted for  £1,900 diamond and citrine . earrings – thought to have been a Christmas present. The earrings were by Chelsea-based . Kiki McDonough, whose designs were once worn by Kate’s husband Prince . William’s mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales. The duchess completed her look with a . pair of vertiginous black suede heels by Spanish designer Mascaro, made . especially for the occasion. A spokesman for the family firm, founded in Menorca, said: ‘They were a special request from her office.’ Kate paid the full price of £169 for the shoes, as her staff said she was unable to accept gifts .

But the difficulty of keeping a heavy object 'floating' on earth has ensured they remain thoroughly ficitonal on our planet. But in the low-gravity environment of the International Space Station, 240 miles up, it's a different matter. Nasa has just completed trials of a real, floating robot - a free-flying Smart Sphere which is controlled by a Samsung Nexus phone. A Nasa astronaut controls one of the Smart Spheres in testing on the Space Station last month: The robots can fly, navigate and record information all by themselves . The space agency freely admits that the inspiration for Smart Spheres - which completed testing successfully last month - came from science fiction. 'I looked a little bit at the lightsaber training remote in Star Wars. That was part of the inspiration,' says Yuri Gawdiak, who originated the concept. The compact, free-flying satellites -- known as Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient Experimental Satellites, or Spheres - have a 'brain' formed of a Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone with the 'phone' chip removed so it didn't interfere with electronics, and AA batteries instead of the lithium ion ones in Samsung's phones. Star Wars provided the inspiration for Nasa's floating droids - from a scene where Luke Skywalker 'trains' his lightsaber fighting skills by battling a floating orb . The spheres move around by releasing carbon dioxide, which offers propulsion in the low-gravity environment of the ISS . The robots will be able to inspect areas of the station for the ISS astronauts - and Nasa also plans to test whether the robots could endure flights outside the station. In time, the space agencies, will test whether the robots can handle other, more challenging tasks. 'The tests that we are conducting with Smart Spheres will help NASA make better use of robots as assistants to and versatile support for human explorers -- in Earth orbit or on long missions to other worlds and new destinations,' said Terry Fong, project manager of the Human Exploration Telerobotics project. Spheres in testing on board the ISS - the new version is 'piloted' by an Android smartphone. Nasa is to test whether the devices could even fly outside the ISS . Each smartphone is connected to a SPHERES free-flyer via a cable. A wireless network connection (Wi-Fi) to the space station's computers provides a connection to the ground. NASA anticipates using other types of smartphones on the station in the future.","Smartphone powered 'Sphere' navigates by itself .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 4:54 PM on 26th December 2011 . Artifacts from the heady days of the Californian Gold Rush have been unearthed by workers digging San Francisco's multi-billion dollar transport terminal. They include clay opium pipes from a Chinese laundry, French perfume bottles, a chipped porcelain chamber pot found in an outhouse and animal bone toothbrushes. City archaeologists and residents are excited by the 70 artifacts discovered beneath their feet during the excavation of the $3.9 billion (£2.5bn) Transbay Transit Centre. Fragile: A pair of porcelain dolls on show in San Francisco which were discovered when the old transport terminal was demolished . Treasure: Archeologist James Allen examines a barrel strap and rope pulley shown at the exhibition . The old demolished terminal stood on the same site once inhabited by working-class Irish immigrants and Chinese labourers who lived back to back on the sand dunes of the busy Gold Rush port known as Yerba Buena Cove. They were the Donahues and the . Dollivers, the Wings and the Lings, and the now-seemingly quaint . accoutrements of their lives are being unearthed. There . are clay opium pipes and ceramic teapots from China; French perfume . bottles; dainty English serving dishes, apothecary jars and the heads of . hand-painted porcelain dolls and abandoned chamber pots. They . all date back to the mid-to-late 1880s, when the cove was reclaimed and . clapboard houses went up on Mission, Natoma and Minna streets, between . First and Beale. Tools: A rusty rope pulley, crucibles and a chisel are shown at the exhibit of artifacts which were dug up during excavations . They were filled with Irish, Swedish, German and Italian immigrants, as well as the Chinese who had come during the Gold Rush and then stayed on to help build the railways and bridges. The million-square-foot sleek and modern bus and railway station being built in the South of the Market financial district is billed as the 'Grand Central Station of the West'. It will serve as the northern end of California's planned high-speed rail line between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Today's residents and workers can see . the exhibit in the lobby of the building that houses the Transbay Joint . Powers Authority. The artifacts are accompanied by historic . photos and documents. Unearthed: Medicine bottles and a chipped porcelain chamber pot found in a privy were among the artifacts . On display: Animal bone toothbrushes were among 70 artifacts unearthed by workers . Fortune seekers Prospectors are depicted in a wood engraving washing for gold during the Californian Gold Rush of 1849 . An 1885 article from the San Francisco . Chronicle reveals Irish landlords JS and Mary W Dolliver were seeking . 500 dollars in damages from Ah Wing and 11 Chinese tenants for the . 'offensive smells from the laundry that injured the rental value of . the plaintiff's premises'. The California Gold Rush began at Sutter's Mill, near Coloma On January 24, 1848. John Marshall found shiny metal in the tailrace - a man-made channel carrying water - of a lumber mill he was building for pioneer John Shutter on the American River. After tests showed that it was gold, Sutter wanted to keep the news quiet because he feared  his plans for an agricultural empire would be ruined. But rumours soon spread and were confirmed in March 1848 by San Francisco newspaper publisher and merchant Samuel Brannan. After he had set up a store to sell  prospecting supplies, he strode through the streets  holding aloft a vial of gold, shouting, 'Gold! Gold! Gold from the American River!' Soon, waves of immigrants from around the world, later called the 'forty-niners', poured in. As Sutter had feared, he was ruined - his workers left and squatters took over his land and stole his crops and cattle. Ming Ng, a Chinese engineer with a firm that hopes to work on bus storage for the new terminal, visited the exhibition. 'It's very interesting to see the pottery compared to the metal things that are all rusted and ruined,' he said, looking at a pristine blue-and-white Chinese teapot. 'The pottery looks almost new.That's the Chinese character for longevity.' James . Allan, an archaeologist with William Self Associates, the firm ensuring . the items are unearthed and preserved, said: 'It's not often that you get a chance to . have a window into what used to be.' Mr Allan said the artifacts were not necessarily unique and that they expected to unearth hundreds more. 'What is unusual is that we were able to identify the people and occupations of the early Gold Rush,' he said. 'When . the Gold Rush started in the 1850s, the miners came here and there was . no place for them to live, so they lived in the sand dunes and then tent . camps. 'We found the evidence: a wooden floor and a lot of bottles, barrels, a privy, leather shoes and boots.' They . would have worked in the Risdon Iron Works - which built pipes for . Hawaiian plantations - the Selby Smelting Works, Miners Foundry or the . San Francisco Gas and Light Co. Mr . Allan said his favourite find was an oblong, earthen storage jar found . fully intact. The unglazed pot with a thin neck and bulbous belly was . used to store grain, olives or water. 'It's the equivalent of today's plastic water bottle in that they were used, and used, and then thrown away,' he said. He . also liked a porcelain chamber pot found at the bottom of an outhouse. It might have been part of a toiletry set sold by Sears back then for . 2.25 dollars (£1.44).","Clay opium pipes, porcelain dolls and French perfume bottles unearthed .

A 20-month-old girl who vanished a week before Christmas after being put to bed in her father's home was taken away and didn't walk out on her own, investigators said today as they announced the largest reward ever offered in the state to help find a missing person. It marked the first time since the search for Ayla Reynolds began that police have directly said they don't believe she left the house by herself. 'At this point in the investigation... we are confident that Ayla did not walk out of the house by herself,' Waterville police Chief Joseph Massey said at a news conference at which he announced a $30,000 reward was being offered for help finding her. Toddler: Ayla Reynolds, of Waterville, Maine, was reported missing from her bed on Saturday morning by her father Justin DiPietro, who told police he last saw her when he put her to bed the previous night . 'We believe that someone was involved . in taking her out of the house, and that's where the focus of this . investigation has turned.' The reward, gathered with donations . from residents and businesses in the Waterville area, is the biggest . ever offered in Maine for a missing person, state Department of Public . Safety spokesman Steve McCausland said. Massey said the developments in a . mystery that's been featured on national television programs have not . shifted the matter from a missing-person case to a criminal . investigation. Despite the passing of the Christmas holiday with no sign . of Ayla, police remain committed to finding her, the chief said. 'The intensity of the investigation . is as high today as it was the first day,' he said. 'We continue to . employ every single resource we have.' Blames father: Trista Reynolds, little Ayla's mother, said the girl's father should have protected her . Removed: Trista, a recovering alcoholic, said state officials removed Ayla from her care while she went into rehabilitation . Massey was joined at the news conference by Waterville attorney John Nale, who appealed for the safe return of Ayla. 'I ask and I plead with the person or . persons who have Ayla Reynolds that they please keep her safe and . return her safely to us,' Nale said. Hundreds of police officers, game . wardens and local residents have been searching for Ayla since she was . reported missing by her father, Justin DiPietro, on the morning of . December 17. Massey said a report about the case on the Fox network . television program 'America's Most Wanted' during the weekend generated . some leads, which are being checked by police. DiPietro told investigators he last . saw Ayla when he put her to bed the night before at his home in . Waterville, a city of 16,000 residents about 20 miles north of the state . capital, Augusta. Father: Justin DiPietro, left, told police he last saw Ayla, right, when he put her to bed last Friday night. He said she was wearing green pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them . My mom: Ayla, right, ended up with her father after child welfare workers intervened while her mother, Trista Reynolds, left, checked into a 10-day rehab programme . He said she was wearing polka dot pajamas with the words 'Daddy's Princess' on them and had a cast on her broken left arm. 'That is the last place Ayla was seen. So as you might expect, we're going to give a lot of attention to that particular house' Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey . Ayla ended up with her father after . child welfare workers intervened while her mother, Trista Reynolds, . checked herself into a 10-day rehabilitation program. Reynolds, who completed the rehab, . had filed court papers that she said she hoped would lead to the return . of her daughter. The filing came the day before Ayla was last seen. Appearing on the Today show last week, Reynolds said she blames DiPietro for their daughter's disappearance. Sadness: Isaiah Vear, 5, of Waterville, Maine, leaves a memorial after placing a toy for missing 20-month-old Ayla Reynolds outside the toddler's home on Thursday in Waterville . Address: Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey, at the podium, speaks to members of the media regarding the investigation into the disappearance of 20 month-old Ayla Reynolds at a conference in Waterville, Maine . 'I trusted him to keep her safe,' she said. 'And now she is missing and I don't . know where she is. I blame him right now. He did not protect her the way . he was supposed to.' DiPietro has said he has 'no idea what happened to Ayla or who is responsible.' 'I will not make accusations or . insinuations towards anyone until the police have been able to prove . who's responsible for this,' he said.

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 5:23 PM on 27th December 2011 . Travel chaos today affected millions of motorists as Britain's roads were filled with those returning from Christmas breaks. Although many workers will not return to their jobs until after the new year, huge numbers of Britons headed back to the office just two days after Christmas, as sales and disrupted rail services also led to severe congestion. Traffic experts reported massive tailbacks and problems on parts of the M6 motorway in the West Midlands and North West, as well as the A1 in Yorkshire and the North East, the M1 in the South East and the M25 around London. Jammed: A traffic camera over the A1(M) Junction 48 southbound shows huge tailbacks due to a combination of the sales, lack of trains and people returning from Christmas breaks . Tailback: On the M60 in the North West, there were similar scenes as the worst incidents saw traffic stretch back for miles . At lunchtime today, traffic images showed congestion stretching back for over 30 miles on one stretch of the M25 clockwise near Surrey. On another section of the M25 traffic journeys were slowed by over an hour as slow traffic snailed back for 28 miles, with motorists battling to get in and out of the capital. Meanwhile on the M6, the regularly-congested section of motorway north of Birmingham was again clogged up with motorists, many of whom were returning from Christmas breaks. Further tailbacks of around 10 miles were reported on the M1 in Leicestershire, along with delayed journeys further north on the M60 and M62. On the M25 at junction 5 southbound, drivers faced a battle to get into and out of the capital . A spokesperson for the Highways Agency said today: 'We are seeing traffic levels on motorways and major A-roads increase after the Christmas break. 'We currently have some incidents and congestion on some of our routes, including the M1, the M25, the M6 and the A1. As always, we are doing all we can to clear these as quickly as possible.' The increased congestion may also be due to the hugely reduced rail services currently running around the country. Crawling: A map of the M25, where red and yellow lines indicate incidents or severe delays, shows the congestion motorists had to contend with today . Delays: A map of other parts of England shows there were significant . delays on the M11 in the South East and the M6 in the Midlands and North West . Before Christmas, train services started to run down in advance of a complete shut-down of the rail network on the day itself, with services axed in most areas on Boxing Day, and a late start to a limited Bank Holiday service on Tuesday. East Coast, Virgin West Coast, First Great Western, Northern Rail, Cross Country, South West trains and  South Eastern are among those writing off the majority of Christmas with blank departure and arrivals boards. The worst tailbacks on Britain's roads were on the nation's motorways, as motorists struggled in light of rail chaos. The M25 suffered from slow traffic and congestion for 30 miles clockwise between junctions 7 and 15, while other sections of the motorway also endured tailbacks over 10 miles long. The M6 suffered problems around Cannock between junctions 9 and 11 in both directions, while further up the same motorway in the north west there were also severe delays. In the north west, the M60 and M62 were subject to heavy congestion, while back down in the south and east the M1 and M11 motorways were packed with motorists. And many of those trains which do eventually run between Christmas and New Year will be subject to delays, diversions and cancellations caused by engineering works and the dreaded bus replacement services. Noel Roman traveled from Castle Cary in Somerset to London's Paddington station on the first train of the day on Tuesday. Fuming Noel, 30, said: 'I had to fight to get my reserved seat this morning, as the train was absolutely heaving. 'I sat for almost two hours with a suitcase on my lap while elderly women and children were forced to stand in the aisles - it was chaos. 'The buffet section closed early because the train was too busy and we had some heavy delays getting across the country. 'People were getting on and off at every station but once I actually got into London the traffic wasn't that bad - it was just getting towards the city that proved difficult.' In Scotland, railway signal workers started a 72-hour strike yesterday in a dispute over career progression. And to add to Britons' woes, Tube services were hit by striking Underground workers who wanted extra pay to work on Boxing Day. An AA spokespersons said the return to work after Christmas was traditionally a time when they have to deal with a lot of breakdowns. The spokesperson said the huge amount of traffic on the roads was also a result of the Boxing Day sales which started yesterday.","Thirty-mile tailbacks on M25, huge queues on other motorways .

Villagers from Stilton in Cambridgeshire are celebrating after a ban on them producing their own famous cheese was lifted, but bizarrely it must be called something else. A 'ridiculous' legal ruling in 1996 meant the village’s famous cheese could not be produced in Stilton as it is not in Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. However, a new decision means the village’s Bell Inn, which first sold the cheese, has been allowed to produce and sell it to locals again - as long as they don’t call it Stilton. Cheese production: Liam McGivern celebrates the ban being lifted with a a special batch of Stilton cheese, although his will be called Bell Blue . Landlord Liam McGivern, 60, said: 'This is something to really celebrate. Stilton has come home. 'It was ridiculous that up until now we couldn’t make Stilton in Stilton. 'People would come in and ask for it and I’d have to explain we legally couldn’t make it. It was embarrassing.' One of the pub’s owners in the 18th century, Cooper Thornhill, became the first Englishman to market the cheese. Pride of the village: Liam McGivern will be making three or four batches a week of the blue cheese . Local folklore says that he discovered the cheese while visiting a nearby farm in 1730 and made a business arrangement granting the pub the exclusive marketing rights. Despite being the birthplace of the blue-veined cheese, production moved away from the village in the 18th century. Production later moved to Leicestershire, and in 1996 the Stilton Cheese Makers Association (SCMA) imposed a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) order meaning that Stilton cheese could only be produced in Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. However, local historian Richard Landy challenged this ruling after finding evidence that the cheese was first created in the village. Now the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has allowed the pub to produce the cheese, using the ingredients and techniques required, for local sale. 'We’re going to call it Bell Blue,' Mr McGivern added. 'It will be Stilton cheese made identical to the SCMA’s recipe, and we’ll be making three or four batches a week. 'It takes a day to make the cheese and then it has to mature for three and a half months. 'We feel it’s worth the wait.' The pub has already produced its first batch, and a special launch date has been pencilled in for March 1, which is planned to be a day of celebrations. Historian Richard Landy said: 'The village has every right to be proud of its association with the cheese. 'Two years ago we found evidence that the cheese was created here, but production moved to Leicestershire in the 18th century. 'Since then we’ve been applying to get Stilton in the PDO and finally DEFRA have come to agreement. 'It’s a great day for the village and one that’s been a long time coming.'",Stilton can only officially be made in three counties .

Promise: David Cameron, pictured arriving in Prague today for the funeral of Vaclav Havel, has pledged not to give up the Falkland's sovereignty . In a Christmas message to the Falkland Islands, Prime Minister David Cameron has insisted Britain will not give up their sovereignty. He pledged: 'We will never negotiate on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands unless you, the Falkland Islanders, so wish. 'No democracy could ever do otherwise.' His statement comes days after Argentine president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner claimed Britain was ready to use force to seize other countries' natural resources 'anywhere, anyhow'. Mrs Kirchner pledged an 'eternal fight' for the disputed islands which Britain has held since the 1830s and fought a brief but bloody war over in 1982. Cameron also used the message to insist that Britain wanted to work with Argentina. He said in his statement: 'It is in our interests that we have a constructive relationship with Argentina. Brief but bloody war: Argentine president Cristina Kirchner pledged an 'eternal fight' for the disputed islands which Britain has held since the 1830s and fought over in 1982 . 'There is common ground to be found on issues like the global economy and climate change. He continued: 'We want to work with Argentina on those issues. 'But . the Argentine government has continued to make statements which . challenge your right to self-determination, and we can never accept . that.' Argentina has repeatedly claimed . ownership of the Falklands and the dispute has escalated since the . exploration for oil in in the islands' territorial waters in recent years. There were newspaper reports yesterday claiming that Argentina has prepared secret plans for a new invasion. Diplomacy: Uruguay President Jose Mujia and Mrs Kirchner at the Mercosur summit in Montevideo. He claims the decision to ban Falklands flagged shipping was purely economic . Foreign Secretary William Hague is today due . to try and defuse the situation by phoning his Uruguayan counterpart . to discuss his country's support of a shipping ban on . Falkland Islands vessels introduced earlier this week. Mr Hague arranged to speak . by phone with Luis Almagro about the powerful regional trading bloc . Mercosur, which includes Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, which has banned . ships flying the Falkland Islands flag from docking in their ports. Mr Hague was expected to tell Mr Almagro that the ban is unfair and to urge Uruguay to reconsider its stance to avoid damaging relations between the two countries. He was also set to reiterate Britain's determination to protect the right of Falklanders to determine their future. Uruguayan president Jose Mujica has already sought to ease tension by insisting he had nothing against the UK and admitting he supported the ban for economic reasons. Writing on an official presidential . website, he said his primary concerns were his country's tourism and . construction industries and bilateral trade between Uruguay and . Argentina. Argentina yesterday imposed tough new limits on foreign ownership of farmland. Voted 62-1 by the senate, it stops non-Argentines from holding title to more than 2,500 acres. It also means across the nation  no more than 15 per cent of the farmland can be sold to foreigners, and no more than 30 per cent of foreign-owned land can be held by people from the same nationality. Exceptions include foreigners who are married to Argentine citizens, have Argentine children or have five years of permanent residency. He added: 'Whenever relations with Argentina deteriorate, our economy and employment suffers.' The growing tension lead to a call from former Navy chief Lord West, a veteran of the 1982 conflict, for a military show of force. Richard Ottaway, chairman of the influential Commons foreign affairs committee, responded by asking Mr Hague to act swiftly to stop the diplomatic row worsening. In another development Mrs Kirchner yesterday named a replacement ambassador to Britain ahead of the . 30th anniversary of the Falklands War in April. The post has been vacant for more than two years since Frederico Mirre retired at the end of 2008. Mrs . Kirchner decided against sending a replacement in protest at British . government support for the start of new oil exploration around the . disputed Falkland Islands. A . new ambassador was not expected to be named until the end of 2012. New boss: Argentina will appoint a new ambassador to London for the first time since 2008 . The dispute over the Falklands began to escalate in January last year when oil exploration rigs arrived off the islands. Rockhopper Exploration, which carried out test drilling in the waters around the islands, said in September it had made significant finds and could begin pumping by 2016. Britain has around 1,200 service personnel on the islands, and there are three Royal Navy warships in the area along with four RAF Typhoon fighter bombers.","Message comes days after Argentine president promises 'eternal fight' for islands .

Awkward: Ed Miliband is 'reluctant to put himself out there' Labour is to launch a campaign to make Ed Miliband more ‘human’ in the new year after friends warned that he is less popular with voters than Gordon Brown. The Labour leader has been told by his closest friends that he needs to make a concerted effort to ‘make people like him’ by doing ‘sofa’ interviews with lifestyle shows on television and women’s magazines. But allies are concerned that Mr Miliband is ‘reluctant to put himself out there’ because he feels awkward about revealing details of his private life to the media. Yesterday the Labour leader said he would not change after polls showed that his  personal standing is the worst of the three main party leaders. ‘I will carry on being what I am,’ he said. But an ICM survey for the Guardian newspaper made grim reading for Mr Miliband, suggesting he needs to do more to connect with the public. It found that 48 per cent of voters approve of David Cameron’s performance, compared with 33 per cent for Nick Clegg and only 32 per cent for Mr Miliband. The Prime Minister enjoys a net approval rating of plus five, while the gap between those who think Mr Miliband is doing a good job and those who don’t is minus 17 points. His position has been undermined after a performance at the most recent Prime  Minister’s Question Time, which was widely derided as wretched even by members of the Shadow Cabinet. ‘People still don’t know Ed and he needs to get out there and show them who he is,’ a friend told the Mail. ‘The problem is that he is very reluctant to put himself out there. He’s not comfortable talking about himself. It’s just the same as it was under Gordon.’ Popularity contest: Friends have warned Ed Miliband that he is less popular with voters than Gordon Brown . Mr Brown won widespread public support for an interview he did with Piers Morgan before the general election, in which he discussed the death of his first child Jennifer, coming close to tears at times. But the source added: ‘By the time Gordon did the Piers Morgan thing, it was too late. ‘We have to make Ed do it. ‘He’s a nice guy but all that people see is someone who is a policy wonk and stabbed his brother in the back.’ Former Tory leader Lord Howard said: ‘Ed Miliband faces a very difficult task – I don’t think he is making a very good fist of it.’",Labour leader has been told to make a concerted effort to 'make people like him'

A White Horse customer, who asked not to be named, said: 'It is a very close community here, the regulars all know each other and so this news has come as a huge shock to everyone. 'Nobody can quite believe what has happened. June was an amazing lady, it is just so sad that she’s gone.'

Astronomers all over the world were left awe-struck by Comet Lovejoy's incredible close shave with the Sun as it came within 87,000 miles of its fiery surface last week. And now, the comet's trajectory across the Earth's skies have been captured in dazzling detail by an astronomy enthusiast. Using only a simple digital camera with a long exposure to let more light in, these incredible images were taken . by stargazer Alex Cherney as Comet Lovejoy blazed a trail through the . night sky after appearing over the Earth's horizon. Magical moment: Stargazer Alex Cherney captured Comet Lovejoy streaking across the night sky at Cape Schanck, Victoria, on the southern coast of Australia . Trailblazing: After its near-miss with the Sun, Lovejoy continued its journey through the Milky Way over Christmas. Stargazer Alex used a digital camera with a long exposure to capture the comet . Dazzling scene: Mr Cherney, a 36-year-old IT consultant, took advantage of the lack of light pollution from the remote peninsula . Experts expected the comet, which is . 1,600ft in diameter, to have vapourised when it passed through the Sun's . intensely hot corona. However, it survived the close encounter intact and continued on its path through space. The . commander of the International Space Station took pictures of Lovejoy . last week from his vantage point 240 miles above the Earth. But Mr Cherney managed to capture the comet with its long, streaky tail from the ground at Cape Schanck, Victoria, Australia. Mr . Cherney, a 36-year-old IT consultant, took advantage of the lack of light pollution from the remote . peninsula on the south coast of Australia to record the dazzling scene. Global gazing: The comet's journey was tracked all over the world. Here, it is seen at dawn over Santiago on December 22 . Up in the stars: Comet Lovejoy is seen over the European Southern Observatory's base at Cerro Paranal, in northern Chile's Atacama Desert . Mr . Cherney said: 'Luckily Comet Lovejoy survived the near-miss with the . Sun and it put on a magnificent display in the southern sky.' It passed about 87,000 miles from the . Sun on December 16 when it was supposed to have been obliterated but . re-emerged out the other side of the corona. It lost its tail during the close encounter but developed a new one as it streaked away. The comet has been tracked all over the world since passing over the Earth, spotted in South America. Dan Burbank, the commander of the International Space Station, saw the comet from a magnificent vantage point – 240 miles above the Earth’s horizon. He described seeing the comet as ‘the most amazing thing I have ever seen in space’ in an interview with WDIV-TV in Detroit. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Heavens above: Comet Lovejoy is visible near Earth's horizon in this nighttime image photographed by Dan Burbank . Star-struck: Burbank described the view as the most amazing thing he'd ever seen in space . Star gazers were left astonished when Comet Lovejoy survived its hellishly hot encounter with the Sun. The 660-foot-wide icy rock disappeared around the back side of the Sun, coming within 87,000 miles of its surface, and emerged triumphantly out the other side. Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory caught the great escape on camera. After the dramatic event it tweeted: ‘Breaking News! Lovejoy lives! The comet Lovejoy has survived its journey around the sun to reemerge on the other side.’ Lovejoy was only discovered on November 27 this year and was named after the amateur Australian astronomer who spotted it, Terry Lovejoy. Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured Comet Lovejoy diving past the sun just 87,000 miles from the surface - and surviving the 'graze' Heat is on: Lovejoy emerges from the clutches of the Sun and was spotted escaping last week by Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory . It is classed as a ‘Kreutz sungrazer’, which is a class of comet whose orbit comes very close to the Sun. They are named after the 19th-century German astronomer Heinrich Kreutz, who figured out that they are actually the remains of one huge comet that broke apart. Soon after Lovejoy was found three separate space agencies excitedly began tracking its trajectory – Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Its fate was quickly marked as doomed because it would rush headlong into the Sun’s hellish corona. Writing on the Sungrazing Comets website, Naval Research Laboratory scientist Karl Battams said: ‘We have here an exceptionally rare opportunity to observe the complete vaporization of a relatively large comet, and we have approximately 18 instruments on five different satellites that are trying to do just that.’ Team effort: This map illustrates how countries from all over the world contribute to the running of the International Space Station . However, Lovejoy had other ideas and in a brief, but very clear, clip can be seen zooming away to safety from the Sun’s fiery clutches. Robert Massey, from the Royal Astronomical Society, was stunned by Lovejoy's close encounter. He told MailOnline: ‘It was an extraordinary event. Lovejoy was incredibly close to the Sun, closer to the Sun than the Earth is to the Moon. ‘And it’s certainly a pretty rare event. The Solar Heliospheric Observatory [Note: the video is from the Solar Dynamics Observatory] has seen many examples of comets being destroyed as they approached the Sun and there was a great deal of interest in this because there was an expectation of spectacular debris. ‘I suppose if something is big and tough enough it will survive. This event tells us that the comet was rather more robust than expected. Doubtless it had a very rough ride though!’ Mr Massey explained that comets have probably survived skirmishes with the Sun before, but we just haven’t been able to see them. ‘It just shows how good the technology is now,’ he added.","Amateur stargazer captures incredible images of Comet Lovejoy's trajectory over the Earth's horizon .

"By . Gavin Allen . Last updated at 4:47 PM on 20th December 2011 . The anti-government protestors in Russia have been caught up in a scandal that seems designed to split them after secret recordings of private phonecalls in which they attacked each other were posted on a pro-government website. In an echo of KGB-era surveillance, six hours worth of calls from opposition leader Boris Nemtsov were leaked to the website www.lifenews.ru. The website is part-owned by Yuri Kovalchuk, an ally of Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media. Opposition activists: Evgenia Chirikova (left) was insulted by Boris Nemtsov (right) of the People's Freedom Party - their differences over protest tactics were made public in six hours of secretly-recorded phonecalls . Angered: Nemtsov wanted to organise Government sanctioned protests, which led Chirikova to say he was in liege with the State . The biggest protests of Putin's 12-year rule, expressing anger at the debated election results which re-installed him as Prime Minister, were split into two camps. One group, led by Nemtsov, advocated a legal protest that had been negotiated with the Russian Government. Another group, led by Yevgeniya Chirikova, 35, wanted to organise a protest in front of the Kremlin, without Government permission. Nemtsov believed that a legal protest would swell the ranks, with the addition of white-collar protestors who feared police clashes in an unsanctioned event. Chirikova said that Nemtsov must in cahoots with the Government. And according to the recordings Nemtsov called her 'either a bitch, or an idiot'. Thowing a curveball? Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, shown here at a school gym Cheryomushki, Siberia, is an ally of the owner of the website - www.lifenews.ru - which published the calls . Man of action: Putin hummers a 'golden' spike to start a construction of a new railway near the city of Kyzyl in Siberia, on another of his legendary publicity drives . In the secretly recorded phonecalls Nemtsov apparently said of Chirikova: 'She is a f***** but what the hell can I do about it? She doesn’t f****** listen.' 'You are a f****** great Russian writer for f**** sake. Can you call that Chirikova and tell that bitch that you are insulting Nemtsov by accusing him of working for money. That bloody beast.' In other comments, Nemtsov derided supporters he was trying to muster for a rally as 'office plankton - chemical internet types' who had never seen a riot policeman in their lives. Nemtsov, a former cabinet minister who was once tipped as possible Kremlin leader during the rule of Boris Yeltsin, said the recordings had been heavily edited and partly falsified in an attempt by Putin’s supporters to splinter the opposition. 'Parts of the recordings are genuine, part are heavily edited and parts are simply fake and falsified,' said Nemtsov. Nemtsov said the publication was an attempt by Putin and Kremlin acting chief of staff Vladislav Surkov to undermine a day of mass protests planned across Russia on December 24. Electoral anger: The ongoing protests have been the biggest under the varying reigns of Putin and there is another major event planned for December 24 . Tactical disagreement: Nemtsov's position was, he said, designed to attract to the protests white-collar workers who were afraid of being manhandled by police in an unsanctioned demonstration . 'The aim of Putin and Surkov is to prevent a mass meeting on the 24th and to split the opposition,' he said. 'They will not succeed: it will have the opposite effect and more people will come out.' Surkov's office did not return a call for comment. A spokesman for Kovalchuk’s Bank Rossiya refused to say if there were any links between Kovalchuk and Lifenews, requesting written questions. Lifenews said it did not know of any links with Kovalchuk, who Forbes says has a net worth of $1.5 billion. Nemtsov said he had offered his apologies to Chirikova for his comments but that the publication had contravened his rights as a Russian citizen and his lawyers were working on getting a criminal case opened. In Russia, only state security services or their commercial cousins have the resources to carry out such extensive 'phone hacking' so the recordings may also indicate the enduring influence of the secret police in Russian politics. Russia's secret police have long meddled in Moscow politics, even coining the Russian word 'kompromat' - or compromising material - to describe potentially damaging information used for blackmail. While Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) in 1999, the security services were suspected of having a hand in the airing of a video purporting to show Russia's top prosecutor cavorting in bed with two women. Lifenews, which has delivered scoops such as the January 24 suicide bombing at Russia's biggest airport by building close contacts with the law enforcement agencies, did not say where it had got the recordings. Ashot Gabrelyanov, the 22-year-old chief executive of News Media which owns Lifenews, refused to say if he had got the recordings from the security services. 'You as a reporter yourself know I cannot disclose my sources,' he said by telephone. 'The cynicism of the opposition leaders is 10 on the Richter scale,' Gabrelyanov said on his twitter account. 'Dudes, in five years in show business I have never heard such an outrage.' He said he would publish more recordings.","Opposition leader Boris Nemtsov had his phone tapped .

One of the Dior counters said they had their first sale just 13 seconds after opening this morning. 'There are also a lot of people at the Marks and Spencer and John Lewis food counters, where people seem to be panic buying.' He said lots of items were heavily discounted so that stores can clear their shelves for the sales. 'It's definitely been a shopper's market,' he added.

Shoppers are predicted to blow an incredible £2bn today with 38 per cent of all British adults expected to splash out on last minute gifts and party food. Yesterday bumper crowds spent a similar amount as they packed into shopping centres across the country with many stores staying open until 11pm to cope with demand. Analysts claim that 12.44pm, yesterday . was the busiest shopping minute of the entire year with 57 trolleys per second . predicted to have been going through checkouts at Morrisons stores . across the country alone. Savvy consumers waited for . stores to start their sales in the final run-up to Christmas and made 33million transactions worth more than £1.5billion . throughout the day. Seasonal shop: Bargain hunters are expected to make 33million transactions worth more than £1.5billion today . Bargain hunters: Many firms have already launched . their January sales ahead of what are set to be the two most . lucrative days of the year on the high street . It was an increase of around 8 per cent compared with the same period last year which, according to Visa, made it Britain's busiest shopping day ever. The rise is partly attributed to . shoppers being able to enjoy some of the biggest pre-Christmas discounts . ever as desperate stores try to boost sales. Cash-strapped Britons are expected to splash out £500million more than last year in the post-Christmas sales, researchers claim. More than half of us are hoping to bag a bargain in the New Year sales, spending an average £92.58 each, according to a study by Sheila's Wheels home insurance. Clothes, shoes and accessories will be at the top of shopping lists with Britons forking out 79 per cent more on these items than a year ago. One-in-five of those polled said they plan to spend more in the New Year sales than on their Christmas shopping. The study estimates £4.8billion will be spent in the January sales this year with the average person buying 15 items in the January sales. Jacky Brown, of Sheilas' Wheels, said: 'The January sales are getting earlier every year as so many families are eager to grab a bargain rather than fork out a fortune over Christmas.' Early bird shoppers queued outside . John Lewis, Hamleys and Marks & Spencer before doors opened this . morning, keen to beat the crowds. London's West End was heaving and hectic scenes were reported across Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street. A spokesman for the New West End . Company, which represents 600 retailers across the three famous shopping . streets, said it was even busier than anticipated, adding that about . 70 per cent of the shoppers appeared to be men who had left their gift-buying to . the 11th hour. He said: 'We expect one million shoppers today and tomorrow through the West End stores, spending £100 million in total.' Many firms have already launched . their January sales ahead of what are expected to be the two most . lucrative days of the year on the high street. Many stores have drafted in thousands of extra staff to help ease the heavy load. A spokesman for Asda said: 'We're expecting today and tomorrow to be our busiest days of the year. This year we are pulling out all the stops to give our customers an extra 7,000 helping hands.' Morrisons, meanwhile, claimed it experienced its busiest shopping minute of the year at 12.44pm. However, the discount deals are already starting to backfire. Customers who bought early have been angered to find their purchases are now selling for a fraction of the price. Shoppers carry their bags on Market Street in Manchester as after collecting their final Christmas gifts . Discount bonanza: The busiest hour of shopping in 2011 was due to take place yesterday between 12pm and 1pm . A report by accountant RSM Tenon . released yesterday paints a bleak picture of the state of the high . street. It claims 13 per cent of retailers, around 8,990, are at high . risk of collapsing into insolvency. As a result January sales have started early as firms try to lure consumers with the promise of rock-bottom prices. In . some cases, major chains are discounting by up to 80 per cent. French . Connection, which issued a profit warning earlier this month, brought . forward its sale by a week. The move comes a week after a Government . commissioned report by self-styled retail guru Mary Portas warned that . the UK’s high streets were under threat from online competition, with . some town centres described as ‘dead’. Countdown to Christmas: A man carrying gift-wrapped presents is distracted by goods in a shop window . Latest government figures showed . sales volumes for November fell 0.4 percent from the previous month, . according to the Office for National Statistics due to poor sales of . computers, watches, jewellery and carpets. More . worrying data released yesterday showed UK shopper numbers for this . week are lower than the weak snow-affected period last year. In yet another blow to stores, Boxing . Day sales have been thrown into chaos in the capital after a High Court . judge refused to ban a Tube strike. Drivers . who have already seen their salaries rocket to more than £50,000 per . year are walking out demanding £365 overtime pay and a lieu day. Hundreds of families expecting to . tuck into a luxury feast this Christmas will be left disappointed after . Fortnum & Mason admitted many of its famous hampers will not arrive . in time. The store blamed . ‘severe’ IT problems as it said that thousands of hampers are still . sitting in its warehouse, shattering the hopes of present-buyers who . have shelled out a small fortune for one of the wicker baskets. It . has promised to provide refunds to those who ordered their hampers in . good time and still do not receive them by Christmas Eve.","Customers who bought early angry at prices of same goods being slashed .

A 14-year-old Alaska girl is in critical condition days after a 26-year-old man injected her with heroin at his Anchorage home, authorities said today. Sean Warner is charged with a drug-related felony and other counts. Court documents say Warner tried to revive the girl himself and did not immediately call police. 'Her condition is dire,' Assistant District Attorney Regan Williams said today, adding the girl was on an artificial respirator. 'The real sadness is that there's not that much brain activity.' Scroll down for video . Accused: Sean Warner is charged with delivering a controlled substance to a minor, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and evidence tampering . The girl continued to be treated on Tuesday at an Anchorage hospital, where she was taken Friday with a drug overdose, police said. Charging documents say the girl, identified only as J.D., was found to have heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine in her system. Medics told authorities the girl had sustained damage to her brain and heart. Warner's bail was set at $90,000. A booking official said Warner remained in custody. KTUU reports that Warner's father and a friend dispute the allegations and they say Warner is a Navy veteran who saved lives as a medic in Afghanistan. The two said Warner had struggled since returning from the war. Warner is being represented by the Public Defender Agency, but it was unclear if he has been assigned to a specific attorney yet. Dangerous: Warner had a gram of heroin and the girl said she was willing to try something 'new', but didn't want to inject herself, according to court files . According to the court papers, two others went with Warner to pick the girl up on Thursday night and take her back to Warner's home to hang out. Williams said both of the witnesses are men. Warner was sharing a gram of heroin with the men, and the girl said she was willing to try something 'new', but didn't want to inject herself, according to the documents. Warner tried to inject the girl, but failed, so he had her lie down on his bed and hold out an arm, then used his belt as a tourniquet and shot 25 to 30 units of heroin, taking several times to find a vein, the papers say. The two witnesses told authorities they left the girl on the bed and found her the next morning, face down in her vomit, according to the papers. 'They felt for her pulse, sat her up, and grew concerned at her condition and upset at Warner's ambivalence,' the documents state. Scene: It is believed two others went with Warner to pick the girl up on Thursday night and take her back to Warner's home (pictured) to hang out . Tragic: The two witnesses told authorities they left the girl on the bed and found her the next morning, face down in her vomit at the Alaska home . Warner did not want to call 911 because . he didn't want authorities to find drugs, so instead he placed a tablet . of Suboxone – a prescription drug that's used to treat opiate addiction – . under the unconscious girl's tongue, according to the court papers. A . couple hours later, the girl began convulsing and Warner called 911, the . papers say. The girl was rushed to Providence Alaska Medical Center. Responding officers did not find drugs because Warner had locked his bedroom door and told police it belonged to a roommate, the court documents state. After police left, Warner and one of the witnesses put needles and other 'related evidence' into a box then dumped it behind a trash bin at a nearby business, according to the papers, which say police later recovered paraphernalia including syringes. Warner is charged with delivering a controlled substance to a minor who is at least three years younger than the accused, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and evidence tampering. He also is charged with theft, accused of stealing a $900 surveillance system from Costco on the same day he took the girl to his home, according to the documents.

Anti-domestic violence campaigner Denise Brown has been caught up in the tricky situation of her son being accused of beating up his girlfriend. Ms Brown’s sister Nicole Brown Simpson was suspected of being killed by ex-husband O.J. Simpson in Los Angeles, California, in June 1994. In the early hours of this morning Sean Brown, 25, and his girlfriend Amy Johnson, 22, were arrested at their home in Orange County, California.

Campaigner: Denise Brown, left, became famous for her stance against domestic violence after O.J. Simpson, right, was suspected of killing her sister in 1994 . They were arrested for injury charges and investigators told MailOnline visible marks were seen on them both. Mr Brown will be in court tomorrow. Both were taken into custody after police responded to the scene of their home following a call at 2:30am on Tuesday morning, reported TMZ. Ms Brown founded the Nicole Brown Foundation as a non-profit U.S.  organisation that stands against domestic violence. Former NFL player O.J. Simpson is serving a nine-year sentence at a jail in Lovelock, Nevada, after his robbery and kidnap conviction in Las Vegas. The conviction came in October 2008 after . a trial following his botched heist to retrieve sports memorabilia he . said was stolen by dealers. Sensational trial: Nicole Brown Simpson was suspected of being killed by ex-husband O.J. Simpson in Los Angeles, California, in June 1994 . He was acquitted in October 1995 of the murders of Mrs Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman despite huge amounts of evidence against him. After the bodies were found in a pool of blood on her driveway, Simpson began a bizarre slow-speed car chase with police. Almost 100million people are thought to have watched the events live on TV as the sports star held a gun to his head while being driven by a friend. He was allegedly headed for the Mexican border with $5,000 dollars and his passport when he was tracked by authorities. Eventually more than 25 police cars trailed him until he surrendered on his mansion's driveway an hour and a half later. Evidence against him included bloodstains in his car, a glove holding DNA from the three and a sock with his victims' blood on his bedroom carpet.","Nicole Brown Simpson killed in Los Angeles in 1994 .

"By . Jenny Hope, Claire Bates and Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:15 PM on 23rd December 2011 . British women with breast implants at the centre of a health scare have been told there is no evidence they are linked to increased cancer risk. It comes after the French government yesterday announced it would foot the bill for 30,000 women with the implants, made by Poly Implant Prostheses, to have them taken out. There are fears the gel inside might leak out and cause cancer. Panic: Amanda Harrison developed lumps on her spine after her breast enlargement operation . But the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency stressed that there was ‘no evidence’ this was the case. More than 40,000 British women are believed to have the French-made implants, known as PIPs, which were among the cheapest on the market. Fears about their safety first surfaced 18 months ago, when surgeons noticed they were rupturing much more quickly than other brands. The French health watchdog ordered an inquiry, which subsequently reported ‘serious irregularities’ in the implants. It has also emerged many of the implants were missing a protective coating designed to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked from spreading through the body. So far tests have failed to find any firm evidence the implants could trigger cancer. But yesterday France’s health minister Xavier Bertrand announced that women could have the implants removed, paid for by the French health service, as a ‘preventative’ measure. Burst: Plastic surgeon Denis Boucq holding defective silicone gel breast implants, which were removed from a patient . Responding to the announcement, the . MHRA said: ‘We recognise the concern some women who have these implants . may be feeling but we currently have no evidence of any increase in . incidents of cancer associated with these implants and no evidence of . any disproportionate rupture rates other than in France. ‘We therefore do not believe that the . associated risks of surgery from breast implant removal can be . justified without further evidence.’ It emerged this week that 250 British . women are preparing to sue six clinics which fitted the implants in a . class action case next month. They are unlikely to be able to sue the . implant company itself because it has been declared bankrupt as it has . no money and no assets. The corrective surgery in France will be . paid for out of public health funds, with a new implant funded if the . treatment was done as part of reconstructive surgery following breast . cancer. While the French . are likely to spend millions reversing implant operations, the British . authorities have continually denied that they are trying to save money . by not doing the same thing. The Department of Health in the UK said they had consulted with nine countries over safety concerns before making the decision. Around . one in 100 women in the UK receiving a French-made PIP implant has . suffered rupture, where the seal has split, exposing the silicone to . body tissue. Sufferers: Catherine Kydd and Gemma Garrett had complications after having PIP implants . Amanda Harrison, from Ramsgate, was one such unlucky patient who suffered a ruptured implant four years after surgery. Her Harley Street surgeon waived his fee to remove it this year but she still had to pay £1,500 for hospital costs and the anaesthetist. The 40-year-old is still suffering today. The leaked silicone has spread to her lymph nodes and a scan has revealed two bulging lumps on her spine. Gemma Garrett, 30, who was Miss Great Britain 2008, and beauty therapist Catherine Kydd, 39, have also had the implants removed after suffering painful complications. While . implants which have ruptured should be removed, experts say other women . may face unnecessary complications from procedures to explant - take . out - the implants. Around 270 women are considering legal action, although the company responsible has gone into liquidation so claims are being directed against clinics and individual surgeons. Sally Taber, director of the Independent Healthcare Advisory Services (IHAS) supported moves made by Health Secretary Andrew Lansley and the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to reassure women. She said ‘We are pleased to see that health and regulatory experts from the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Denmark, Malta and Australia have all confirmed no evidence of any increase in incidents of cancer associated with PIP breast implants and no evidence of any disproportionate rupture rates. A British health chief said the French decision to remove the implants had caused 'unnecessary alarm' ‘France are looking increasingly isolated in their stance and their pre-emptive statements have caused unnecessary alarm. ‘Our advice is that anyone concerned about their breast implants should contact their GP or implanting surgeon. ‘There . is no evidence to suggest explantation is necessary and on top of that . there are, of course, the associated risks with going under general . anaesthetic that women should consider before rushing into any surgery.’ The French government admitted this morning that there was no conclusive evidence of a link between the sub-standard silicone and cancer. The . PIP implants were pulled off the market last year, when the . manufacturers were closed down by French authorities after being accused . of fraudulently using a non-approved silicone gel for almost 10 years. The non-medical grade silicone is believed to have been originally designed for mattresses. They have a higher than normal rupture rate – up to five per cent among French women – and have been linked to the death of a French woman from a rare form of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and implicated in at least seven other cancer cases. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said women with breast implants may have a very small but increased risk of developing ALCL, with 34 cases of ALCL identified worldwide. French authorities will cover the cost for women to have the implants taken out. But UK regulators have insisted there is no link with cancer – no such cases have been reported here - and there is no need for women to have them removed. Figures from the MHRA suggest 84,300 PIP implants have been sold in the UK since 2001, with 411 cases of failure including rupture since 2001. Based on the assumption that each woman has two implants, at least 42,000 women in the UK could be affected, according to the MHRA. In the UK, women are advised to contact their breast implant surgeon if they have concerns. Douglas McGeorge, ex-president of British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) said ‘There is no medical evidence that these implants need immediate replacement. 'The current guidelines are that individuals with PIP implants should go back to their treatment facility, where the integrity of the implants can be assessed and a regime for monitoring planned. ‘Clearly many patients may choose to have something done in advance of implant failure, knowing the problems associated with these implants.’ British lawyers claim the MHRA should have acted sooner and more decisively to protect women. Mark Harvey, a partner at Hugh James solicitors, which is representing more than 250 women, said some of his clients had complained of inflammation, fatigue and fibromyalgia, a musculoskeletal pain disorder. He said: ‘I do not believe that MHRA’s reaction to date has been satisfactory. I am and have been very critical of their role throughout the history of this product.’","British health official accuses French government of causing 'unnecessary alarm'

"By . Rebecca English and Andrew Levy . Last updated at 11:21 PM on 27th December 2011 . Whip-crack smart in a tweed jacket and tie – and with a cheery wave for well-wishers – the Duke of Edinburgh finally left hospital yesterday after heart surgery. Only the 90-year-old royal’s slightly pallid complexion hinted at the ordeal he had been through since developing chest pains at Sandringham the day before Christmas Eve. Still, it was hard to believe the Queen’s notoriously robust husband had undergone such an operation for a man of his age just five days earlier. I'm fine! With a wave to reporters, Prince Philip was driven away from Papworth Hospital to rejoin the Royal Family at Sandringham . The Duke of Edinburgh seemed pleased to be leaving hospital after receiving treatment for a blocked artery . Festive cheer: The Duke appeared delighted to be able to rejoin his family . Departing from Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire shortly before 9.30am in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover, royal sources said Prince Philip was relieved to be going home but ‘immensely’ grateful for everything medical staff had done for him. The Queen was, by all accounts, eagerly awaiting his return, having last seen him on Christmas Eve. It didn’t take the duke long to get back in the party mood. Just hours after arriving back at the royal country retreat, he joined members of the Royal Family at a shooting party lunch. The family ate together at Wood Farm in Wolferton, which is situated on the estate and often used as an informal weekend retreat by the royals. Prince Philip was seen sitting in the front seat of a Land Rover as he was driven away from the farmhouse at 1.45pm to return to the main house. Meanwhile the rest of the party returned to the pheasant shoot. In a statement Buckingham Palace said: ‘His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh was discharged from Papworth Hospital this morning. He is returning to Sandringham by car. He is very much looking forward to rejoining his family.’ On departure, Prince Philip thanked the staff at Papworth for the excellent care he has received during his stay. Arriving at the Queen’s private estate in Norfolk, some 60 miles away, Philip again smiled and waved at bystanders. The driver appeared to deliberately slow down to allow the elderly royal to be photographed – as if the prince wanted well-wishers to see what a remarkable recovery he had made. An estate worker said: ‘The prince could easily have arrived at a different entrance to avoid being seen, but he instead went through the normal gate where he knew he would be seen.’ Most members of the Royal Family are thought to have remained on the estate to welcome back Philip, although Viscount Linley and his wife Serena and their two children departed just ten minutes before his arrival. Health scare: Prince Philip had been in Papworth Hospital since Christmas Eve . Arrival: As Prince Philip arrived at Sandringham he looked tired and weak . Dressed to impress: At her first Royal Christmas . the Duchess of Cambridge looked elegant in a simple maroon outfit by a . British designer, while the Queen wore a lavender coat with a glittering . diamond and pearl brooch . On the way to the church: (Left to right) Prince Andrew, Prince William, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Charles, Prince Harry, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall made their way to the service while Prince Philip recovers in hospital . A pheasant shoot also began on the . 20,000 acre estate around 15 minutes before the duke turned up. A keen . shot even now, Philip was desperately disappointed to have missed the . traditional shoot this year but did attend the lunch. The Queen’s husband was airlifted to . Papworth on Friday night after he complained of chest pains. Following . tests, doctors discovered a blocked artery and inserted a small surgical . stent to open it up and restore the blood flow to his heart. Although the procedure is relatively common and considered ‘minimally invasive’, doctors were taking no chances given his age and kept the prince in hospital for four nights – much to the notoriously grumpy royal’s displeasure. The incident is the most serious health scare suffered by the duke since he was hospitalised with a serious chest infection in 2008. Philip has always enjoyed good health and, according to those who work with him, still possesses the energy of a man half his age. His busy public schedule sees him carrying out up to 350 official engagements each year. In the last 12 months he has also been on two gruelling foreign tours with the Queen, to Australia and Ireland, and next year is due to accompany her on a nationwide Diamond Jubilee tour. Despite the setback he is said to be in ‘good spirits’. Aides admit, however, they cannot be sure how quickly he will resume public engagements or even whether he would attend church on Sunday as usual.

"By . Fiona Macrae and Peter Allen . Last updated at 1:20 PM on 22nd December 2011 . The Department of Health have insisted today that there is no need for British women with PIP breast implants to have them removed. It comes a day after the French government announced they would foot the . bill for tens of thousands of breast implant removals, amid fears they could raise the risk of cancer. The French-made implants, were filled with a silicone gel . believed to have been made for mattresses gel rather than medical grade gel. Edwige Ligoneche was diagnosed with lymphatic . cancer two years after having breast surgery using a French-made . silicone gel. (See box below) Yesterday the French government told 30,000 affected women to have the implants to have them taken out. But a similar number of British women who also have the controversial implants face hefty surgical bills for the same treatment. However, a . Department of Health spokesman, played down health fears, saying: 'The . MHRA had discussions today with other health or regulatory experts from . France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, . Denmark and Malta. 'They all agreed . that there was no evidence of any increase in incidents of cancer . associated with PIP breast implants and no evidence of any . disproportionate rupture rates. This is in line with UK findings.' It follows advice from the Medicines and Healthcare products . Regulatory Agency(MHRA) that said women with an concerns should make an appointment with their implanting surgeon and have a full discussion. But the advice has led to accusations that British women, including breast . cancer survivors, are being left in limbo. Lawyers acting for hundreds of women who are suing UK clinics over health concerns linked to the breast implants, said the medical regulator needed to take action. Mark Harvey, a partner at Hugh James solicitors, which is representing more than 250 women, said some of his clients had complained of inflammation, fatigue and fibromyalgia, a musculoskeletal pain disorder. Mr Harvey added: 'The recent reports have, of course, been very worrying to our clients, many of whom have already suffered terrible problems as a result of their implants. 'I have written again to the MHRA to urge them to react to the developments in France and, similarly to France, to set up a suitable protocol for women affected in this country. 'I do not believe that MHRA's reaction to date has been satisfactory; it is unbelievable that the MHRA have not ensured that they were involved with the consultations in France about a product that affects such a large amount of women in this country.' Up to 50,000 women in this country . have the Poly Implant Protheses, or PIPs, which were among the cheapest . on the market and widely used in cosmetic clinics both here and abroad. Sally Taber, director of Independent Health Advisory Services, said the breast implant industry should be more heavily regulated. Appearing on BBC Breakfast, she said: 'I think what we need to have as a good lesson from all of this, is this country needs a breast implant registry. 'I've been involved in setting up with the Department of Health, the national joint register, so you could monitor every hip and every knee that a patient has in this country.' Ms Taber said patients should make an appointment to see their surgeon if they were worried about their implants. 'I'm not saying that they don't need to worry but the advice in this country is that they do not need the implants removed,' she added. 'MRHA, as I said, have done separate studies, and it's really important that patients take note of what MRHA said. 'The industry has got a complaints mechanism if they want to complain to the organisation where they had the implant.' Douglas McGeorge, of the British . Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: 'People with PIP . implants do have a higher failure rate and there is a significant risk . at some point they might rupture. 'If this is a worry for patients, the sensible thing to do is to get them replaced earlier rather than later.' The NHS does take out damaged implants . but won't pay for new ones to be put in, meaning patients could be left . with a bill that runs into tens of thousands of pounds, as well as the . trauma of additional surgery. Fears about the safety of PIPs . surfaced 18 months ago when surgeons noticed they were rupturing much . more quickly than other brands. An inquiry ordered by the French health watchdog reported 'serious irregularities' in the implants. But when the gel's manufacturer was . asked for studies on the safety of the filler, it said it did not have . any – because it believed it was to be used in the manufacture of . mattresses. It also emerged that many of the implants were missing a . protective coating designed to stop them from splitting and prevent any . gel that leaked from spreading through the body. Tests failed to find any firm evidence . the implants could trigger cancer. But earlier this month the death of a . French woman who had breast augmentation in 2005 raised fresh concerns. Edwige Ligoneche died from a rare form . of cancer and the French Society of Plastic, Reconstructive and . Aesthetic Surgery said the gel could have been an 'aggravating factor'. Threat: The'low quality' implants contain industrial silicone - designed for computers and electronic devices - instead of medical-grade fillers . Yesterday French government spokesman . Valerie Pecresse said: 'It is a matter of urgency that all women who . have had these PIP implants are identified and the implants removed.' 'The profession has no choice,' said . Laurent Lantieri, a leading plastic surgeon based in Paris, adding that . the removal of the implants was a 'simple operation'. Meanwhile, 27 British women are suing . their clinics to pay for the operation and for compensation for scarring . and emotional trauma. Kevin Timms, of Hertford-based Garden . House Solicitors, said those worst affected could be in line for tens of . thousands of pounds. The firm is also trying to compile a national . register containing details of all those who have the implants.","'Low quality' implants contain industrial silicone designed for computers and electronic devices .

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 3:12 PM on 22nd December 2011 . Scientists still have only seen glimpses of the 'cosmic dawn', when stars were forming in the calm, dark cosmos. An international team lead by Masami Ouchi of the University of Tokyo has found the most vigorous star-forming galaxy yet seen from the period - a huge mass of gas forming stars at a rate of around a hundred suns per year. It's one of the most distant galaxies ever seen by mankind - and it's also unique. Although nine galaxies have been detected from the period just after Big Bang, the 750-million-year-old GN-108036 was forming stars far faster than the others, when most of the universe was still cold and dark. A researcher at the University of Tokyo has found the most vigorous star-forming galaxy yet seen from the cold, dark period just after the Big Bang - a large mass of gas forming stars at a rate of around a hundred suns per year . The team obtained calculated the galaxy's distance from Earth to confirm that it is one of the most distant galaxies ever discovered. Analysis of Hubble images showed intense brightness that made it clear stars were forming rapidly. The astronomers found a large mass of gas, equivalent to about a hundred Suns per year, was forming stars. Team leader Ouchi said, 'The significant finding about GN-108036 is that it demonstrates the existence of a vigorous star-forming galaxy when the universe was still very cold and dark.' The star was discovered by the Subaru Prime Focus Camera in Hawaii - then astronomers observed it with a spectrograph from the Keck Observatory, also on Hawaii, to confirm its distance from earth. Astronomers have so far detected nine galaxies from the period 600 to 800 million years after the Big Bang - the 'cosmic dawn' - but GN-108036 the most active star-forming region detected to date . Yoshiaki Ono at the University of Tokyo, a team member and the leading author of the article, said, 'We went back and repeated our observations on three different occasions over two years. We observed the feature at the same wavelength on each occasion. It is undisputed evidence for the huge distance to the galaxy.' The astronomers searched for a sign of detection by using recent observations of the GOODS field with the Hubble Space Telescope's newly-installed camera, WFC3. They confirmed detection of GN-108036 in the WFC3 image; the galaxy's intense brightness in the intrinsic ultraviolet indicated that it contained many young, massive stars. 'The amount of stars born every year was more than ten times higher than those in the other galaxies at a comparable distance,'explained Ono. 'We're surprised to know that such a vigorous galaxy existed at a time when the universe was only five percent of its present age.'","Image from 750 million years after Big Bang .

Lomer, 71, and Pauline Johnson, 69, perished with their . grandchildren Lily, 10, and Sarah and Grace, both 7. Mr . Johnson worked as 'Happy Santa' Rubble: The house has been demolished by firefighters after the fatal blaze . Mrs Badger and boyfriend Michael Borcina survived the horrific Christmas day fire at her Stamford, Connecticut home. The couple had stayed up late wrapping gifts in front of the fireplace before loading the smouldering embers into a bucket and going to bed, emergency workers told the New York Daily News. This was thought to have been the cause of the fire. Mrs Badger's elderly father Lomer Johnson had played Santa . Claus right up until Christmas Eve because it was 'all he ever wanted to . be'. The grandfather played Father Christmas at the Saks Fifth Avenue . flagship store in Manhattan, New York. His wife Pauline . Johnson, 69, watched on as he handed out candy canes and posed for . pictures with delighted children. The Johnsons were to celebrate their 49th wedding anniversary today. They moved to the New York area . from Kentucky five years ago to be near their grandchildren, according . to the New York Times and Mr Johnson landed his dream job. Survivors: Mother-of-three and former Calvin Klein art director Madonna Badger, left, and boyfriend Michael Borcina, right, were seen being led away by fire officials from the destroyed property on Christmas morning . 'That’s all he ever wanted to be,' a family member told the New York Times. 'He stopped shaving the day he retired.' A store spokeswoman added: 'Mr Johnson was Saks Fifth Avenue's beloved Santa, and we are heartbroken about this terrible tragedy.' Loved: Lomer Johnson, pictured as his character Happy Santa, worked his 'dream job' at Saks in Manhattan, New York on the day before he died . Prior to becoming Father Christmas, Mr Johnson had a long career as a safety chief at a liquor company in Kentucky. Lomer Johnson was remembered fondly as a stickler for safety by a former boss at Louisville based liquor maker Brown-Forman Corporation. 'He spent his career trying to keep others safe,' retired Brown-Forman executive Robert Holmes Jr said in a telephone interview. 'And the irony is that he dies in a fire.' During Johnson's long career with Brown-Forman, whose many brands include Jack Daniel's and Southern Comfort, he was responsible for security and safety at the company's headquarters and production plants. His responsibilities included helping plan fire drills, his colleague said. Mr Holmes, who worked with Mr Johnson for more than a decade at Brown-Forman, remembered his co-worker as a big man with white hair and a commanding presence. 'He was a man of not a lot of words, but when Lomer spoke or gave his opinion, it was always well thought out,' Holmes said. He said he was a bit surprised that the longtime security chief had become a department store Santa but added: 'I could see Lomer doing something like that because Lomer had a passion for people.' Firefighters desperately tried to reach the family members who were trapped on the second floor of the $1,725,000 house by the raging flames. Witnesses said Mrs Badger, who runs Badger and Winters . fashion branding consulting firm and created the Mark Wahlberg underwear adverts for Calvin Klein, was dazed as rescue workers helped her. She was heard saying: 'My whole life is in there.' She was seen being led away from the . flames with Mr Borcina, who was barefoot and wearing . boxers and a t-shirt. Mr . Borcina is the president of New York City construction firm Tiberias . Construction Inc., believed to be the company renovating the . five-bedroom home. This is thought to be unrelated to the fire. Mr Johnson was known as 'Happy Santa' and started the festive career after his granddaughter asked him to . pretend to be Santa Claus. On site Gigmasters.com, the former security director writes: 'I've enjoyed it more than any job I've ever had.' Along with his wife and grandchildren, Mr Johnson was unable to escape the flames at the Connecticut home. What remained of the home was torn down today after it was deemed unsafe by authorities. Neighbours came to the tragic scene to leave flowers, candles and soft toys by the family's mailbox. Witness Charles Mangano, who lives near the . scene, said: 'My wife woke me up and said there was a huge fire that she could see out the window. 'I ran outside and heard someone . yelling ''Help, help, help me''...I ran up the driveway and saw there . were tons and tons of fire apparatus here. Tragic: . The three young children and their grandparents were killed in the . blaze which completely destroyed their $1.7 million home (pictured) early Christmas morning. The children's mother and boyfriend survived . Destroyed: The five bodies were recovered from the property's second floor on Christmas day . 'There was nothing I could do.' The neighbour added that he didn't know the family who lived in the home. 'They moved in this summer, there was a whole construction job going on there... it was new people.' Madonna Badger were reported to be a 'fair condition' at Stamford Hospital on Sunday afternoon. A supervisor at the hospital said she was treated and discharged by the evening. Her whereabouts are unknown, . Mr Borcina was also hospitalised but his condition was not released. Police officers drove Mrs Badger's husband, Matthew Badger, from New York City to Stamford on Sunday morning. Happier times: Michael Borcina (left) who runs a renovation company . was working on the five-bedroom home owned by Madonna Badger . Mrs Badger's former super, Trifu Penca, . told the New York Post the couple had separated three years ago. She . filed for divorce in October. A relative told the paper that Mr Badger was 'absolutely distraught' on hearing of his daughters' deaths. 'It . is a terrible, terrible day for the city of Stamford,' Mayor Michael . Pavia told reporters at a news briefing at the scene of the fire. 'Her loss defies explanation.' Governor Dannel P Malloy . 'There probably has not been a worse Christmas day in the city of Stamford.' Governor Dannel P. Malloy, a former mayor of Stamford, offered his condolences to Mrs Badger and her family in a statement and said her loss 'defies explanation'. Acting Fire Chief Antonio Conte said . desperate attempts by firefighters to rescue the family were thwarted by the intense flames and heat. 'We just couldn't get to them,' Conte . told reporters clearly emotional having witnesses the horrific scenes . faced by all of the emergency crews. A total of 46 firefighters attended the scene.

Aftermath: Investigators examine the roof of the house which collapsed during the deadly fire in Stamford . 'It's never easy, that's for sure. I've been doing this job for 38 years. It's not easy.' All five victims were removed from the second floor of the burnt-out building. Deadly blaze: Madonna Badger, who is estranged from her husband, was a Calvin Klein art director . The house was being renovated but fire officials do not believe that was the cause of the blaze. Neighbor, Sam Cingari Jr., said he was woken by the sound of screaming and saw that the house was entirely engulfed by flames. 'We heard this screaming at five in the morning,' he said. 'The whole house was ablaze and I mean ablaze.' Cingari said he did not know his . neighbours, who only bought the house last year and were renovating . it. Power had also gone out in the neighbourhood, he said. Property records show Mrs Badger bought the five-bedroom, waterfront Victorian home for $1.7 million last year. The house is situated in Shippan Point, a wealthy neighborhood that juts into Long Island Sound. Tony Low-Beer, another neighbour, said he was awakened by a neighbor after 4am who told him about a 'raging fire' next door. 'Cinders were flying all over the place,' he told The Associated Press.

She did not exactly spread festive happiness in December 2008 when she claimed she had had a seven-year affair with Gordon Ramsay. But former ‘professional mistress’ Sarah Symonds – who now claims to be ‘clean’ – has admitted the  loneliness of being ‘the other woman’ at Christmas has in the past made her suicidal. Miss Symonds said the fiery Scottish chef had been her long-term lover, although he denied the claims, saying  he was ‘more likely to have an affair with Delia’. The 40-year-old also said she had an affair with shamed Tory peer and bestselling author Jeffrey Archer, and says she has lived as a mistress for 15 years. In a piece for a downmarket tabloid newspaper, she said: ‘I’ve been clean for three years now. ‘I’ve been with no married men since Gordon Ramsay and never will be. I wouldn’t want to be in that situation again.’ Miss Symonds added: ‘I take full responsibility for my past. But having affairs is like a drug – you’re always desperate for your next fix of the guy. ‘It can destroy you. I’ve felt so low I’ve been suicidal. ‘You end up imagining what your lover is doing on Christmas Day and you can’t wait until the New Year because you fool yourself into believing the following year will be your time. ‘If you’re in love with a married man you want a life with him. The fact that he’s having Christmas with someone else eats to your core.’ Miss Symonds hit the headlines in late 2008 when she went public with claims she had been in a long-term relationship with Renfrewshire-born Ramsay. Miss Symonds also claimed Ramsay had been having affairs with two other women. The chef, who is married to wife Tana, denied anything had happened. Now Miss Symonds has spoken about how having an affair with a married man leaves the other woman the odd one out at Christmas when he goes back to his wife and family for the holidays. She warned women to avoid the trap – but gave some money-minded tips for those who do it – and offered a glimpse into how some of her lovers have treated her in the past. Miss Symonds said: ‘My advice is, don’t have an affair. But if you’re going to, know that he’s using you and use him back. Mistresses should get something nice for Christmas – after all, he’s buying his wife something. Celebrity chef: Gordon Ramsay, with his wife Tana, has denied having affairs . ‘Mr X was wealthy and he’d always try to buy me off. One Christmas Eve he gave me  a Cartier bracelet with  diamonds in it. ‘He said: “Each year we’ll put another diamond on it for the amount of time we’re together”. Another man phoned to say he had a Christmas present for me, which he was very excited about. ‘When he turned up he gave me £1,000 in an envelope. It was a sweet gesture, but as we’d just spent a night together his timing made me feel cheap – then he asked me to leave the hotel in disguise so no one would see me. ‘In the end, I used the money to clean a carpet he’d spilled red wine over. ‘At least he spent some money, though. Jeffrey Archer, who was one of the tightest people I’ve ever met, bought me a tin of humbugs for my Christmas present.’ As a poacher-turned-gamekeeper, Miss Symonds also had some tips for suspicious wives. She wrote: ‘Christmas is a good time for finding out if your other half is cheating. ‘Remember, if you think  that something is up, it  probably is. ‘Does he go to bed after you because he doesn’t want the intimacy? Does he take his mobile phone to the toilet because you might check it or perhaps because he’s secretly texting his mistress? ‘Does he have a second phone you don’t have the number for? Look for clues, such as receipts for hotels or presents you know nothing about. ‘I wasted years being a mistress but I’ve finally emerged as a much stronger person.’ s.bruce@dailymail.co.uk .",Sarah Symonds: 'Being in love with married man can eat you to the core'
"By . Anna Edwards . Last updated at 1:23 PM on 27th December 2011 . A mother has been reunited with her long-lost daughter who turned up on her doorstep as a man. Ashley Hughes, 48, was delighted when estranged daughter Toni, 26, suddenly made contact after they spent 14 years apart. But she was stunned to discover that Toni is now a pre-op transsexual taking male hormones and living as a man called ‘Alex'. Together at last: Ashely Hughes was stunned when her daughter, now living as Alex, told her she was going to undergo a sex-change operation . Alex, who has a daughter, revealed to her shocked mother she is about to undergo a full sex change operation to fulfil her dream of physically becoming a man. Despite being a mother Alex, who says her pregnancy in 2006 only confirmed to her that she did not like her body, is determined to change her sex. She was born a girl but suffered from gender dysphoria all her life and said: 'I knew I was different from an early age. 'I felt better when I was dressed in boys clothes but didn't have a clue why I was feeling this. 'Because of this I was the child from hell and it put a huge strain on my relationship with my family - especially my mum.' Unhappy: Toni Hughes, who was born a girl, hated her body and shunned girlish toys . Alex was sent to counsellors, social workers, youth groups and doctors but her erratic behaviour continued. Her mother Ashley said that even as a child Alex shunned girlish dolls and was perpetually upset: 'I remember when Alex ripped the wrapping paper off a present one Christmas to reveal a new Barbie doll and said ""Don't like it"". 'My little girl tossed it aside and turned back to her old building toys. 'Alex - when he was Toni - always seemed desperately unhappy and was constantly moody. 'It was like living with a stroppy teenager but she wasn't even ten years old. 'She wasn't the girl I'd dreamed of - she became a nightmare child.' The pair drifted apart after Alex went to live with her grandmother in Limerick, Ireland, aged 12. In 2006 Alex decided to become pregnant with a male friend as she wanted to be a mother, and gave birth to her daughter Molly. Big change: Alex, far right, gave birth to a daughter but is determined to become a man . Alex added: 'One thing I was clear on was that I wanted to be a mother and I was keen for my child to be biologically mine. 'I agreed with a male friend to have a baby and was over the moon when my daughter, Molly, was born in 2006. 'I hated being pregnant though. I was just so embarrassed to walk around with this huge pregnant belly. 'It was so feminine, so not ""me"" - if anything, having Molly just reinforced my feelings that I somehow didn't quite fit in my own body. 'But the end result - being a mother to Molly - was amazing, and completely worth it.' After the birth Alex was resolved to live like a man and started taking male hormone drugs. Alex phoned her mother without warning in July 2010 to break the news about the drastic sex change, before visiting her at home. She said: 'I was really nervous when I called - I had already undergone numerous psychological tests and hormone therapy and would soon be starting testosterone injections followed by surgery. 'I said, ""Mum, I've got something to tell you. I've been seeing doctors and psychiatrists in Dublin and they agree with me - I'm in the wrong body. I'm becoming a man.' 'There was a long pause on the end of the line - I guess mum was trying to take it all in. 'I snapped and said, ""Say something then. Why aren't you shouting and screaming at me?"".' But far from being angry, Ashley was delighted that they had 'found the final piece of the jigsaw'. She said: 'After the shock subsided it was like a big penny had dropped. 'Suddenly all the awkwardness, the tantrums and depression made sense - I felt like we'd found the final piece of the jigsaw. 'I remember saying, ""Good for you. If it's going to make you happy then for God's sake do it. That's all I want - for you to be happy. Just smile"".' A couple of weeks later, Alex and Molly came over from Ireland to visit Ashley at her home in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear. Ashley added: 'Finally we were able to communicate - Alex and I didn't waste any time getting to know each other and we had a huge heart to heart. 'We even went on the internet to research gender reassignment surgery together. 'Our relationship is brilliant now - I've lost my daughter for ever but it's worth it for the wonderful son I have instead.'","Daughter Toni - now living as Alex - gave birth to a girl .

Snow - The Double Life Of A World War II Spy tells how the journey of Arthur Owens (pictured) into the world of spying began when he walked into the Germany embassy in Belgium in 1935 . When MI5 first set eyes upon him, Arthur Owens was breezily described as 'an underfed Cardiff type'. But the Welsh electrical engineer was a complex man who led an extraordinary life during World War II becoming Britain's first double agent and helping to crack Germany's Enigma military codes, a new book reveals. Given the codename Johnny O'Brien by his paymasters in Berlin, he helped MI5 capture numerous Nazi spies, including all those dropped by parachute or boat in England in 1940. Snow - The Double Life Of A World War II Spy by Nigel West and Madoc Roberts - tells how his journey into the world of spying began when he walked into the Germany embassy in Belgium in 1935. Mired in debt after failing to sell a method for improving batteries he went there in the hope they would be interested in his invention. 'He walked into the German Embassy as an inventor but he came out as the German spy ""Johnny O'Brien"",' co-author Madoc Roberts told thisissouthwales. 'As they secretly rearmed themselves in preparation for war, the Germans were keen to know how prepared Britain was against attack. With his contacts in the military in Britain and his cover as a battery inventor, Arthur Owens was exactly what the Germans were looking for.' But his activities eventually became known to MI5 and it was then that he agreed to work for them thereby becoming their first double agent. His codename became Snow, a partial anagram of his surname Owens. Scroll down for video . Patricia Owens, his daughter from his first marriage, went on to become a Hollywood actress who starred in the 1958 sci-fi classic The Fly. She also appeared in films alongside Marlon Brando and James Mason . Interviewed about his father, Graham White said: 'I would say the only side he was on was his own side. He was very much for himself.' The Welsh nationalist was seen by Berlin as being a key part of building up their spy network in Britain and furthermore the Germans saw nationalists as useful in organising a future invasion. As a result, all agents sent to the UK were ordered to get in touch with 'Johnny'. This then gave MI5 the edge in the espionage war and enabled them to give those they captured a stark choice of either working as double agents or facing the firing squad. These agents were then used to feed false information back to Berlin. Owens became wealthy with his activities but MI5 were never wholly convinced by his loyalty. The book reveals how they also knew that after drinking he would say he loathed the English establishment because his father had been cheated out of money for ordnance he invented in the Great War. To this end they sent a minder - a Swansea policeman - with him when he went on a daring mission to Hamburg to meet the city's head of the secret service known as Dr Rantzau. The Germans were keen to find a drop-off point for weapons along the South Wales coast and MI5, keen to keep their cover as real as possible, sent the men to the Gower peninsula where they found a beach for U-Boots to deliver arms. The book also reveals the men were told by their German handlers that anyone prepared to fly a Spitfire back to Occupied Europe would be richly rewarded. The end to his spying activities came in 1941 when Owens was ordered to go to Lisbon, in Portugal, by Dr Rantzau where he was immediately accused of being a double agent. The book says he admitted it but then, mysteriously, was allowed to return to England where he told MI5 what had happened. The book reveals how MI5 knew that Owens loathed the English establishment because he claimed his father had been cheated out of money for ordnance he invented in World War I . Already suspicious of him, they became wary of whose side he was really on and interned him for the rest of the war. Interviewed about his father, Graham White said: 'I would say the only side he was on was his own side. It looked like he just changed sides with the prevailing wind. He was very much for himself.' He said he had no idea about his father's extraordinary past until after he died and his mother told him. Furthermore, he found out that his step-sister Patricia Owens was the Hollywood actress who starred in the 1958 sci-fi classic The Fly. She would also go on to star alongside Marlon Brando and James Mason. Fearful that her father would still be seen as a traitor she kept their relationship quiet. Mr White said he should have realised there was something odd about his father when as a youngster he walked through his father's shop with a friend carrying a flag which had a swastika on it. 'He went ballistic when he saw this. He said ""Are you trying to get me locked up?!"". We did not understand what he meant at the time but looking back on it now I see the significance.' His father died in 1957 and is buried in an unmarked grave outside Wexford in southern Ireland. When asked what kind of a man his father was, he replied: 'A very interesting person, whatever your loyalties or politics are. He wasn't your average Joe.'","Given the codename Johnny O'Brien by his Nazi paymasters, to MI5 he was known as Agent Snow .

Sometimes they evolve into production vehicles, sometimes they don't - but very occasionally, they offer a vision of the future. Holden's Hurricane - unveiled 42 years ago in Melbourne - was packed with decades-worth of technologies that have become standard in cars. The Hurricane not only had digital displays, it also had a primitive magnetic GPS system, a rear-view CCTV camera, and a hydraulic entry system that would have made the Dukes of Hazzard jealous - the entire roof lifted off on hydraulic plates. Now the concept car has been brought back to life at a motor show in Melbourne. The Hurricane was armed with a rear-view camera, a route guidance system, and hydraulically powered doors . Holden was a subdivision of General Motors, and this 1969 model was a showcase for then far-out technologies such as digital instrument displays . Other 'extras' that would then have smacked of science fiction included a 'Comfortron' air-conditioning system, and a radio with auto-seek, rather than a tuning knob. Even the engine was futuristic - a 4.2-litre Holden V8, turning out 259hp. 'At Holden we have always prided ourselves on our ability to look into the future through our concept cars,' said Michael Simcoe, executive director of General Motors International Operations. 'It's amazing to think that the features we take for granted today were born out of creative minds over 40 years ago.' The 'Pathfinder' GPS system was perhaps the most out-there idea - showing a glowing arrow that told drivers which way to turn, and a buzzer that warned of an upcoming junction. The 1969 Holden Hurricane was a mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive two-seater which showcased technologies such as air con and a radio with auto-seek, rather than a fiddly tuning knob . The restored car was shown off at Melbourne's Motorclassica show this year - the project to rebuild the car had been ongoing since 2006 . The mid-engine, rear-wheel drive . two-seater relied on a pre-GPS system called Pathfinder - which relied . on magnets embedded at every intersection. Although . Sputnik had launched in 1957 - and scientists realised that GPS systems . could be possible quite quickly after the launch - global positioning . was still a long way off. Pathfinder, of course, never took off.","Restored in process lasting since 2006 .

The washing-machine-sized Grail craft are to 'map' the interior of the moon by scanning its gravity field - measured by its effects on the flight paths of the the two craft. It's a mission that Nasa described as a 'journey to the centre of the moon', and will map the moon's interior 100 to 1000 times more accurately than any previous moon mission. Nasa's Grail spacecraft will fire their engines to move into orbit on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day - the twin probes will eventually orbit at just 35 miles up and will 'map' the moon's gravity by measuring its effects on their flight paths . The twin spacecraft have been travelling to the moon since launching from the Florida coast in September - a leisurely journey over a distance that took the Apollo astronauts just three days. 'Both spacecraft have performed essentially flawlessly since launch, but one can never take anything for granted in this business,' said mission chief scientist Maria Zuber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. On New Year’s Eve, one of the Grail probes - short for Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory - will fire its engine to slow down so that it can be captured into orbit. This move will be repeated by the other the following day. Engineers said the chances of the probes overshooting are slim since their trajectories have been precise. But things could still go wrong. Cosmic rays might interfere with the probes' engine burn and they won’t get boosted into the right orbit. 'I know I’m going to be nervous,' said project manager David Lehman of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the $496 million, three-month mission. The twin Grail probes have been travelling to the moon since September - a journey that took the Apollo astronauts just three days. The probes launched on a smaller rocket to keep costs down . Once in orbit, the spacecraft will spend the next two months flying in formation and chasing one another around the moon until they are about 35 miles above the surface with an average separation of 124 miles. Data collection will begin in March. Previous missions have attempted to measure lunar gravity with mixed success. Grail is the first mission dedicated to this goal. As the probes circle the moon, regional changes in the lunar gravity field will cause them to speed up or slow down. This in turn will change the distance between them. Radio signals transmitted by the spacecraft will measure the slight distance gaps, allowing researchers to map the underlying gravity field. Once in orbit, the spacecraft will spend the next two months flying in formation and chasing one another around the moon until they are about 35 miles (56 kilometers) above the surface with an average separation of 124 miles (200 kilometers). Data collection won¿t begin until March . Using the gravity information, scientists can deduce what’s below or at the lunar surface such as mountains and craters and may help explain why the far side of the moon is more rugged than the side that faces Earth. Spectators on the north coast of Cocoa Beach Pier observing in awe as the Delta II rocket launches towards space . The probes are officially known as . Grail-A and Grail-B. Several months ago, NASA hosted a contest inviting . schools and students to submit new names. The probes will be christened . with the winning names after the second orbit insertion, Zuber said. 'Grail, simply put, is a journey to the centre of the moon' said Ed Weiler, head of Nasa's science mission. Spectacular: A huge moon-shaped ball of smoke is produced as the Delta II rocket lifts off . Lead scientist, Maria Zuber said of the mission, 'It . will probe the interior of the moon and map its gravity field 100 to . 1,000 times better than ever before. We will learn more about the . interior of the moon with Grail than all previous lunar missions . combined,' Weiler said. Zuber, . the Grail mission's principal investigator and a planetary scientist at . the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the precise lunar . gravity measurements will help her and other planetary scientists better . understand how the moon evolved over the past 4 billion years. The findings also . should help identify the composition of the moon's core: whether it's . made of solid iron or possibly titanium oxide. Another . puzzle that Grail may help solve, Zuber said, is whether Earth once had . a smaller second moon. Astronomers have speculated that some of the 'landmarks' on the moon's surface are a result of a collision with a second, smaller moon. Knowing . where the moon's gravity is stronger will enable the United States and . other countries to better pinpoint landing locations for future . explorers, whether robot or human. The gravity on the moon is uneven and . about one-sixth Earth's pull. 'If . you want to land right next to a particular outcrop (of rock), you're . going to be able to do it. There will be no reason to do another gravity . experiment of the moon in any of our lifetimes.' Sparks fly as the Delta II begins its take-off (left) before catapulting into the sky ahead of its four-month journey . Zuber . said the Grail findings should eliminate cliffhangers like the Apollo . 11 landing in 1969 by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

An 88-year-old pensioner died after she was left lying on a freezing cold pavement for three hours while waiting for an ambulance, it has been alleged. It is thought Doreen Wignall fell on black ice causing a head injury as she crossed a bridge in Ludgershall, Wiltshire. An investigation is underway into why it took Great Western Ambulance Service allegedly three hours to send an ambulance to a critically-ill pensioner . Repeated calls were made for an ambulance without success while members of the public gave her first aid - including stemming the blood with kitchen towels. People even supplied duvets to protect her from the rain. Eyewitnesses say a paramedic turned up after 65 minutes - followed nearly two hours later by an ambulance. However, the pensioner died two days later in Salisbury District Hospital. It is understood the family think she may have lived if the ambulance had got there sooner. Yesterday top Wiltshire County Councillor Chris Williams and the statutory patient watchdog The Wiltshire Involvement Network demanded the Great Western Ambulance Service conducts an urgent inquiry into the ‘unacceptable’ three hour wait. Mr Williams - who represents Ludgershall on the council - fumed: 'The ambulance took three hours to get there which is a dreadful situation. 'I have been in contact with the Great Western Ambulance Service and there must be an inquiry into this. This must not happen again. 'We have had problems with the ambulance service before in this area. It is unacceptable. The family is very upset by what happened.' Doreen Wignall was taken to Salisbury District Hospital but died two days later . Phil Matthews - who is chairman of the Involvement Network - added: 'I am very concerned about the information forwarded to me about the three hour wait to get to this lady. There should be an inquiry and it must be done very quickly.' Grandfather John Binsley, 71 - who gave first aid to Doreen - said: 'I revived her after she fell unconscious. 'She fell on the black ice. It had been raining. It was an hour and five minutes before a paramedic turned up. I used my kitchen towels to stem the blood from the wound.

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 9:56 AM on 27th December 2011 . A tiny clay seal found under Jerusalem’s Old City is the first relic of religious life inside Jerusalem's Temple Mount 2,000 years ago. The coin-sized seal found near the Jewish holy site at the Western Wall bears two Aramaic words meaning 'pure for God.' Archaeologist Ronny Reich of Haifa University said it dates from between the 1st century B.C. to 70 A.D. - the year Roman forces put down a Jewish revolt and destroyed the biblical Second Temple in Jerusalem. It's the first discovery of a written seal from the period - and the first time archaeology has offered confirmation of religious rituals in the Temple. Israeli archaeologists said on Sunday they had found the 2,000-year-old clay seal near Jerusalem's Western Wall, confirming written accounts of ritual practices in the biblical Jewish Temple . The find marks the first discovery of a written seal from that period of Jerusalem’s history, and appeared to be a unique physical artifact from ritual practice in the Temple, said Reich, co-director of the excavation. Very few artifacts linked to the Temples have been discovered so far. The site of the Temple itself - the enclosure known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary - remains off-limits to archaeologists because of its religious and political sensitivity. Archaeologists say the seal was likely used by Temple officials approving an object for ritual use - oil, perhaps, or an animal intended for sacrifice. Materials used by Temple priests had to meet stringent purity guidelines stipulated in detail in the Jewish legal text known as the Mishna, which also mention the use of seals as tokens by pilgrims. The find, Reich said, is 'the first time an indication was brought by archaeology about activities in the Temple Mount - the religious activities of buying and offering and giving to the Temple itself' The find, Reich said, is 'the first time an indication was brought by archaeology about activities in the Temple Mount - the religious activities of buying and offering and giving to the Temple itself.' The site where the seal was found is on the route of a main street that ran through ancient Jerusalem just outside the Temple compound. Aren Maeir of Bar-Ilan University, a biblical archaeologist not connected to the dig, said the seal was special because it 'was found right next to the Temple and is similar to what we see described in the Mishna.' 'It’s nice when we can connect an activity recorded in ancient sources with archaeological finds,' he said. The seal was found in an excavation run by archaeologists from the government’s Israel Antiquities Authority. The dig is under the auspices of a broader dig nearby known as the City of David, where archaeologists are investigating the oldest part of Jerusalem. The City of David dig, located inside the nearby Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan and funded by a Jewish group affiliated with the settlement movement, is the Holy Land’s highest-profile and most politically controversial excavation.","Dates from between 1st century BC to 70AD - period of Second Temple .

It was revealed that the French Poly Implant Prothese, or PIP, implants at the centre of the scare, which has affected 40,000 British women and 300,000 worldwide, had been sold under a different name in Holland. Dutch healthcare authority spokesman Diana Bouhys said:  ‘We estimate that some 1,000 women in the Netherlands have those implants.’ Burst: Plastic surgeon Denis Boucq holding defective silicone gel breast implants, which were removed from a patient . PIP – once the third-largest maker of breast implants in the world – stands accused of using industrial-grade silicone in some of its implants. There are fears that the implants, which were sold around the world, could cause health problems if they burst or leak. In Holland, the PIP implants were sold under the name M-implants, and the fact that they were rebranded has sparked fears that more women could be affected than originally thought. M-implants and PIP-labelled implants were banned in Holland in March 2010. While the French government has urged the 30,000 women in France with PIP implants to have them removed – and offered to pay for the surgery – other countries, including Britain, have only gone as far as saying that women should visit their surgeons for checks. Israel's . Health Ministry have now opened a special hotline to provide medical . advice after it was believed that products made by the defunct company Poly Implant Prostheses could be linked to increased cancer risk. It is estimated that 850 women in Israel have the PIP implants, some of the cheapest available, representing 5 per cent of the total number who . have undergone the cosmetic procedure. Concerns about their safety first surfaced 18 months ago, when surgeons noticed . they were rupturing much more quickly than other brands. The French health watchdog ordered an inquiry, which subsequently reported ‘serious irregularities’ in the implants and they were pulled off the market. Manufacturers were accused . of fraudulently using a non-approved silicone gel for almost 10 years which believed to have been originally designed for mattresses. Threat: The'low quality' implants contain industrial silicone - designed for computers and electronic devices - instead of medical-grade fillers . They . have a higher than normal rupture rate – up to five per cent among . French women – and have been linked to the death of a French woman from a . rare form of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and . implicated in at least seven other cancer cases. It . has also emerged many of the implants were missing a protective coating . designed to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked . from spreading through the body. It was feared that leaked gel could trigger cancer but to date tests have remained inconclusive. The Israeli Health . Ministry hotline has already dealt with around 1,000 concerned patients over the weekend. The hotline information . indicates that PIP implant procedures were not conducted in public . hospitals but more common at private . medical centers. About 300,000 PIP implants, which are used in cosmetic surgery to enhance breast size or replace lost breast tissue, were sold worldwide before the company went into administration last year. PIP implant procedures have now been banned in Israel. Up to now, there have . been very few reported cases of the removal of ruptured implants in the Middle East, and no reports have circulated about new cases of leakage in . recent weeks. Sally Taber, director of the . Independent Healthcare Advisory Services (IHAS) supported moves to reassure women. She . said ‘We are pleased to see that health and regulatory experts from the . Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Denmark, Malta . and Australia have all confirmed no evidence of any increase in . incidents of cancer associated with PIP breast implants and no evidence . of any disproportionate rupture rates. ‘France are looking increasingly isolated in their stance and their pre-emptive statements have caused unnecessary alarm. ‘Our advice is that anyone concerned about their breast implants should contact their GP or implanting surgeon.'","Implant scandal spread to Holland with 1,000 warned to see their GPs .

"By . David Gerges . Last updated at 3:55 PM on 23rd December 2011 . Motorists were attacked with rocks along a busy A-road after a group of yobs smashed through several car windows. Police are searching for the culprits who damaged 12 vehicles, with a helicopter flying over the motorway were the crimes took place. The group carried out the attack as cars were driving along the a road near Rawreth in Essex, just weeks after a similar incident on the A14 in Suffolk. Through the looking glass: Paul Harvey's car window was smashed by yobs throwing rocks along the A1245 . Paul Harvey, 41, who was driving along the A1245 - formerly the A130, had the passenger window of his Land Rover caved in, believes it was sheer luck no-one was killed or seriously injured. He said: 'I just can’t believe anyone would do something like this. I was lucky it wasn’t my front windscreen. 'There were cars travelling at 60 or 70 mph and it was a busy time of night, this could have easily caused a major accident.' Mr Harvey believes the culprits may have been hiding in the trees by the side of the road on Wednesday when the incident took place. He added: 'It was lucky I was in the car on my own, if someone had been in the passenger seat I dread to think what would have happened. 'The window imploded all the way over to my side of the car. Whatever hit it must have been quite large.' In fact the impact was so that it also dented a rear door of his car. Fatal: Youngsters targeted drivers along the A1245, (the old A130) near Rawreth, Essex . Mr Harvey, who lives in Rawreth, said: 'I was just on the way to see my brother when it happened, on the way back I saw police had pulled over a lot of cars outside the Gables car showroom and the police helicopter was out too. 'They were taking statements and all the cars looked like they’d had something thrown at them. There was one guy taping up his van and there were piles of glass on the road.' Police had to comfort and interview shaken-up victims who pulled into a car park of Gables Cars, near the Carpenters Arms. Meanwhile the police helicopter searched in vain for the culprits. Dangerous: Four vehicles including an ambulance were damaged when youth hurled concrete rubble and stones from a flyover on the A14 in Suffolk (file picture) Police believe a young gang was responsible - and want parents to help them bring these young offenders to justice. Officers are also keen to prevent it happening again and leading to another high profile incident like the one on the A12 where a woman was left seriously injured by a falling concrete block. Sgt Chris Bramhill, of Rayleigh police, believes there must be parents out there who suspect their youngsters may have been involved. He said: 'We would urge parents to know where their children are and who they are with, especially at night. 'Even more so if they are on the side of a busy road where they could be at risk, or in this case, posing a risk to others.' Police have so far received 12 official reports of damaged cars on the old A130 - and are yet to get full details of all the damage caused. Horror: Carol Manley with the injuries she sustained in a near-fatal crash when a concrete block was dropped onto her car on the A12 earlier this month . But they are prepared for more motorists to come forward, wondering how their car has been damaged. Others may have heard a bump, but did not realise that it was due to louts playing a very dangerous game. Chris Black, Rochford district councillor for the Rawreth ward, added: 'Words almost fail me. It’s a stupid, dangerous thing to do. It’s important for parents to know what their children are doing. 'I can’t understand the mentality of somebody who wants to throw rocks at cars at Christmas time or any other time of the year. 'I just hope everybody’s okay and I hope the police will be patrolling the area very carefully.'",Comes one week after yobs threw missiles on the A14 flyover in Suffolk .
"By . Tim Shipman . Last updated at 12:58 AM on 27th December 2011 . Convicted criminals will be banned from claiming compensation for their injuries under plans to be unveiled next month. Justice Secretary Ken Clarke will announce plans to ensure the money goes to victims of crime rather than criminals. Every year criminals claim around £5million from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. Justice Secretary Ken Clarke, left will announce plans that prevent criminals making claims. Soham Killer Ian Huntley, right is currently trying to claim £15,000 for injuries sustained in prison . It has given rise to controversial . claims in which burglars have demanded money for injuries sustained when . escaping the scene of the crime. Thousands is also paid out every year to criminals who sustain injuries in prison as a result of feuds and drug-fuelled violence. Soham murderer Ian Huntley is trying to claim £15,000 from CICA as a result of injuries  sustained in prison from having his throat slit – in addition to a much higher sum in civil damages. In total, 340 inmates made successful claims for injuries resulting in payouts and costs of £3.1million last year. More than 3,000 prisoners made claims. Official figures show that three prisoners got payouts of more than £100,000 while one inmate received £500,000. Another £2million was claimed by convicted criminals who are not jailed. Most of the payouts for jailbirds are for injuries caused by trips, falls or slips as well as accidents while playing sport. Ministers decided to step in because the Criminal Injuries Fund is chronically short of cash. The new plans will also help cut the legal aid budget, which is being trimmed under coalition austerity measures . Almost 50,000 victims of violent crime have been kept waiting for compensation worth in excess of £600million because the compensation authority has run out of funds. They include the children of murder victims and others who need the money to cover medical bills and compensate them for their disabilities and lost wages. Some are owed up to £500,000 after being left crippled by vicious thugs. When the changes are introduced, inmates will still be able to sue prison authorities for damages or negligence if they are attacked. But they will no longer be allowed to claim money from the compensation authority. A senior source close to Mr Clarke told the Mail: ‘It is ridiculous that we are continuing to spend so much money on the injuries sustained by convicted criminals when so many victims of crime are still waiting for funds. ‘There is around £5million a year paid out to convicted criminals and we intend to bring that to an end. That will allow us to save around £20million during the lifetime of this Parliament.’ The plans will also help cut the legal aid budget, which is being trimmed under coalition austerity measures. Hundreds of criminals use legal aid each year to claim compensation for their injuries. The legal aid bill for convicts has doubled in two years to £21million – although that sum also covers those demanding release from jail and softer punishments. The crackdown on compensation payments was originally due to be unveiled in December, but senior government sources say it will now come in January. Government sources described the current system as ‘a shambles’ and said they inherited a compensation authority from Labour which was overspending by £50million a year. The plans will be published as part of a review of the organisation, which was previously criticised for huge delays in paying the victims of the July 7 terror attacks in 2005. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘It is an outrage and a scandal that so much taxpayers’ money is being wasted on compensating criminals, who most people would think lost the right to make these claims.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘CICA receives a budget at the beginning of the year. As the scheme is demand-led the amounts due to victims in any one year can exceed the available budget for any year.’","Every year criminals claim around £5million from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority .

YouTube's recent 'new look' changed the focus of the video-clip site from individual videos to 'channels' similar to ones on television. The site's transformation into a rival to TV services seems set to continue. The latest service from the video giant, YouTube Slam, is a weekly talent show where users vote on their favourite comedy, music and viral clips. YouTube bills it as a 'video discovery experiment' - it also has videogame-like elements, where users earn points for accurately predicting favourites. YouTube's Slam lets users vote for their favourite comedy, music and viral videos of the week - another TV-like element which will help YouTube compete with other TV providers . 'Have some free time this week? Think you can find the next singing sensation, viral video like Charlie bit my finger or Surprised Kitty?' said the official YouTube blog this week.'Each week a new crop of videos battles head-to-head in Comedy, Cute, Music, Bizarre and Dance Slams, where your votes determine who wins the Slam and gets featured on the leaderboard.'Earn points for predicting the crowd favorites, and see how you stack up against other players at the end of each week.' The move is another unusual shift for YouTube, which remained broadly the same for years until Google started offering 'channels' with professional content earlier this year, then rolled this into the site's 'new look'  in early December. The 'competition' is a new, unfamiliar element - more akin to the apps and games on Facebook. 'YouTube is in a process of reinvention at the moment - a rival site, Vevo, is basically taking all of the music videos away from them,' Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst at the Music Industry blog told the BBC.'YouTube desperately need to create a new relevancy for themselves and that's why with the recent site relaunch - making it look more like a rich interactive TV-like experience - and features like Slam are all about trying to give YouTube a unique place in the online video landscape.'","Users earn points for voting for favourite videos .

"By CLAIRE ELLIOT . Last updated at 7:56 AM on 20th December 2011 . Miracle triplets Holly, Cara and Kate Thirkell share a loving hug - after defying doctors who said they would never live. The outlook for the trio was bleak from the moment they were conceived, with medics giving little hope of all three surviving until the end of their mother’ s pregnancy. At one point their devastated parents, Anne and Lawrence, who live near Aberdeen, were warned that even if the girls did survive they would likely be blind or brain damaged. Flower girls: The cheery little girls share a group hug in the snow while wrapped up in fleece tops against the cold . It was a living nightmare for the couple, who feared they might never have a family after six years of trying unsuccessfully. They then faced further agony when the triplets were three weeks old and still in intensive care, when Kate fell seriously ill with an infection and was given less than a day to live. But against all odds, the IVF babies, who were delivered 10 weeks premature, never gave up their battle for life. Now, just weeks after celebrating their fourth birthdays, they are like any other healthy youngsters who love going to nursery, playing games and getting up to mischief. Mrs Thirkell, a 38-year-old teaching fellow, said: 'When I look at them now I can barely believe they are the same babies who were born so tiny. 'The doctors were so negative about the chances of us having all three babies at the end of the pregnancy, we couldn’t think that we’d end up with them all. 'They were worried how the babies were lying because they were too close to the neck of the fallopian tube. 'But they persisted and we are just so grateful that we have all three. There were times I really didn’t think it was going to happen.' Now even a trip to the shops and getting the girls ready for nursery can be an exhausting experience for Mrs Thirkell and her husband, a 43-year-old computer systems engineer. They even have three bedtime stories - . one chosen by each triplet - to read every night as they strive to . treat the girls as individuals. Mrs Thirkell said: 'It’s hard but it’s absolutely worth it. 'We got our family in a oner and we are so grateful we don’t have to go back for more IVF' Miracle sisters: Holly, Cara and Kate Thirkell, all aged four defied doctors who thought they would not survive . The triplets were born at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital on October 2, 2007, by emergency caeserian section. Holly was first to arrive, weighing just 2lb 12oz, followed by her sisters Cara and Kate, at 3lb 2oz and 3lb 3oz, with all three born less than two minutes apart. There were fears the triplets would be born nearly four months premature when Mrs Thirkell’s cervix showed signs of opening just 24 weeks into the pregnancy. As a result she needed a cervical stitch - a risky procedure that can trigger contractions to start. But the babies managed to stay put for another six weeks. Mrs Thirkell said: 'The statistics of any of them surviving was low and if they did survive we were told that there was a high chance they could be born blind. 'That was a real concern but they got over that hurdle and we got to 30 weeks.' Thankfully, despite being so tiny at . birth, they were all breathing on their own and before being whisked . away to the neonatal intensive care unit, they were placed on their . mother’s stomach for a quick cuddle. They were then placed in separate incubators, where they spent the next six weeks fighting for life. An infection three weeks after they were born, however, left Kate so ill doctors feared she would not last another day. She needed several blood transfusions, her liver was enlarged and she was put on a ventilator. Little fighter: Baby Kate fell seriously ill with an infection and was given less than a day to live after the trio were born 10 weeks premature . Doctors spent a week battling to save the tot and her only hope in the end was a cocktail of antibiotics, not normally used on babies, and there were no guarantees there would be no long-term side affects. Mrs Thirkell said: 'They took us into a room and said they didn’t know if she was going to last the day. 'It was horrendous. The fact that we had two others who were doing OK was no comfort. 'We just couldn’t see how we could ever celebrate having the other two if we lost Kate. I just cried and cried, it was absolute desolation. 'It almost felt like she was a part of me. We were then worried that one of the others would catch it and we wouldn’t be so lucky.' But after seven days Kate started to show signs of recovery and following six weeks in hospital, she and her sisters were allowed home. One of the biggest challenges the couple faced was when the triplets turned two and switched from their cots into beds, as they had to rearrange the entire room to stop them from climbing on the furniture. They even thought about installing cameras to keep a close eye on them at all times. But Mrs Thirkell said: 'Fortunately, when you have triplets, it starts off being as hard as it possibly can be and so every year life has got easier and little things like being able to take the girls out on my own and know that they won’t run off makes a huge difference. 'They’re not overly competitive with each other, which makes life easier. They have the odd spat but on the whole they get on really well.'
