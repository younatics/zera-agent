"Washington (CNN) -- Three African men suspected of ties to al Qaeda in North Africa have been arrested in Ghana and flown to New York to face charges that they engaged in drug trafficking and supported terrorism, federal officials said Friday. The three Mali natives will stand trial for an alleged drug conspiracy and conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, authorities said. The Drug Enforcement Administration, which announced the criminal complaint, said the suspects will appear Friday in federal court in New York. Court documents released in Washington reveal a DEA undercover operation that included agents claiming to have ties to FARC, the guerilla army in Colombia that the United States has designated as a terrorist organization. The alleged plot involved shipment of cocaine from Africa to Europe, with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb helping facilitate the trafficking. The suspects are identified as Oumar Issa, Idriss Abdelrahman and Harouna Toure. Authorities said the apparent ties between the suspected African terror group members and the cocaine traffickers appear to represent an increasingly global effort to use the drug trade to support terrorism. While such a relationship is long-standing in Afghanistan, it has not been common in Africa, officials said.","Authorities say Mali men conspired to to provide material support to foreign terrorist group .

"(CNN) -- Federal officials announced indictments Tuesday against four police officers and two supervisors in the investigation surrounding the post-Katrina deaths of civilians on New Orleans' Danziger Bridge. At least three New Orleans police officers were in FBI custody Tuesday afternoon, an attorney for one of them confirmed. Kenneth Bowen, Anthony Villavaso and Robert Gisevius surrendered to authorities. Announcement of the charges stemming from a federal civil rights investigation was made by Attorney General Eric Holder in New Orleans. ""Put simply, we will not tolerate wrongdoing by those who have sworn to protect the public,"" Holder told reporters. Holder promised the Justice Department will help restore the troubled New Orleans police department. ""Today marks an important step forward in administering justice, in healing community wounds, in improving public safety and in restoring public trust in this city's police department,"" Holder said. He was joined by the Justice Department's civil rights chief, Thomas E. Perez, and U.S. Attorney Jim Letten, the top federal prosecutor in New Orleans. The shootings occurred at the bridge on September 4, 2005, six days after Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast. The indictment allegesthat two separate shootings at the bridge resulted in the deaths of a teenager and a 40-year-old disabled man. The indictment contends four officers -- Bowen, Gisevius, Robert Faulcon and Villavaso -- opened fire, killing 19-year-old James Brissette. Minutes later, Faulcon allegedly shot and killed 40-year-old Ronald Madison. The indictment says the officers violated the victims' civil rights. The indictment says police supervisors Arthur Kaufman and Gerard Dugue helped the other officers to obstruct justice during the subsequent investigations. An earlier investigation launched by the local district attorney resulted in charges but no convictions. Federal prosecutors then moved in and launched a new investigation which led to the newly announced charges. Letten said the federal case took so long because prosecutors waited for the local investigation to conclude, so as not to interfere or duplicate that probe. Although the charges announced Tuesday carry a maximum sentence of the death penalty, Letten played down that likelihood, saying an extended process will eventually be followed and any final decision on seeking the death penalty would be made by Holder. Attorney Frank DeSalvo, who represents Bowen, said of the indictment, ""We expected it and are ready to deal with it."" The two shootings occurred on opposite sides of the bridge. In the first shooting, on the east side of the bridge, one person -- later identified as Brissette -- was killed and four people were wounded, prosecutors have said. In the second shooting, on the bridge's west side, Madison, a severely disabled man, was killed. Madison's brother was arrested but later released without indictment, authorities said. A witness to the shooting of Madison told CNN in 2006 that New Orleans police lined up ""like at a firing range"" and fatally shot the man in the back as he fled from them in the days after Hurricane Katrina swept ashore. ""He just fell like he was collapsing,"" Kasimir Gaston told CNN. ""Like something just wiped him out."" Gaston was one of many flood refugees living on the second floor of the Friendly Inn, a low-income motel on the city's east side. He said on Sunday, September 4, 2005, he woke up and stepped onto the balcony of the motel and saw a man running, hands outstretched and being fired upon. Initial police accounts said that Madison, 40, reached for his waistband and turned on police, but Gaston said Madison did not appear to have a weapon and that he was running away from police ""hands out, full speed"" when he was shot. Police declined CNN's request for an interview in response to Gaston's remarks. After the shooting, police said officers had responded to reported gunshots on the Danziger Bridge and that a running gunbattle ensued with six suspects. A police department press release from October 4, 2005, said Madison, described as an unidentified gunman, was ""confronted by a New Orleans Police officer. The suspect reached into his waist and turned toward the officer who fired one shot, fatally wounding him."" When asked if Madison had a gun, Gaston said, ""I didn't see any on him."" No gun was found on Madison's body. An autopsy report obtained previously by CNN and verified by the Orleans Parish Coroner said Madison suffered five gunshot wounds to his back and two in his shoulder.

"Washington (CNN) -- The company that made 44,000 helmets recalled by the Army has stopped all helmet manufacturing. Federal Prison Industries, the company that made the potentially defective combat helmets, was subcontracted to make the helmets by ArmorSource, the company named in the recall. Federal Prison Industries, also known as UNICOR, has also agreed to waive preferential status that gives it right of first refusal on U.S. government contracts. The Army recalled the helmets two weeks ago, when officials said the advanced combat helmets failed ballistic testing standards. Many were used by troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Troops have been instructed to exchange the helmets for ones made by another company, but the Army is still trying to find all the recalled helmets. The company's decision comes after the Justice Department launched an investigation into its helmet manufacturing and an amendment was proposed to the Defense Authorization Bill. That amendment would have forced the company to submit to competitive bidding. The author of the amendment, Rep. Chris Carney, D-Pennsylvania, said, ""Our military men and women deserve only the best equipment and it has become clear that Federal Prison Industries cannot meet the standards required in manufacturing helmets."" The Federal Bureau of Prisons overseas Federal Prison Industries, which uses prisoners in some of its work. Traci Billingsley, the bureau's chief public information officer, said, ""Federal Prison Industries has always strived to make a quality product that meets or exceeds the needs and expectations of our customers."" She said if the company resumes helmet production, it will voluntarily submit to competitive bidding. The company is one of several major manufacturers of combat helmets. A competitor, BAE, laid off some of its staff earlier this year. Josh Drobnyk, a spokesman for Carney, said, ""Absolutely there's a jobs element to it. I don't think it's widely known that prisoners are making the most basic part of a soldier's gear. And this company has quit making helmets right in the midst of an investigation by the Department of Justice."" Army officials said the Justice investigation helped trigger the testing on the helmets that determined they did not meet standards. In addition to the 44,000-helmet contract, Federal Prison Industries had an Army contract to produce 600,000 helmets and a contract to deliver 100,000 lightweight helmets to the U.S. Marine Corps. Rep Carney said, ""FPI has not met protective standards, nor has it met required deadlines in its production of these crucial helmets ... and we can't wait any longer to protect our troops."" Carney is a U.S. Navy Reserve commander, who also served in the Pentagon as an intelligence analyst.","Federal Prison Industries uses prisoners in some of its work .

"(CNN) -- Summer is a great time to barbecue, hit the beach or get out and explore the town. But for gamers it's often a huge disappointment, as the flow of new releases generally slows to a trickle. Mercifully, software publishers are beginning to wise up and use the slower months to issue an increasing number of promising but less high-profile releases that may otherwise have slipped beneath the radar. The following are among my top picks for the season -- sure to keep you happy while others fret about trivialities like fresh air and exercise. Xbox 360 owners can spare themselves the trouble of getting off the couch and download selections, like these three, from Xbox Live Arcade. Due out July 28, Konami's ""Castlevania: Harmony of Despair"" is a classic, 2-D monster mash that combines elements of platform-hopping and adventure to atmospheric effect. ""Hydro Thunder Hurricane,"" is a sequel to the blistering arcade speedboat racer that sees multiple wheelmen competing to cross the finish line. It even allows multiple players to tag-team the adventure. Completing a trifecta of notable, multiplayer-ready sequels, ""Tomb Raider"" spin-off ""Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light"" (PC and PlayStation Network versions are available, too.) also lets you explore, do battle and solve puzzles in the company of friends -- no sleepovers required. On the retail front, be sure to check out ""Madden NFL 11"" for PS2, PS3, PSP, Xbox 360 and Wii. The latest installment in the football franchise streamlines decision-making and play-calling, making for a faster, more engaging virtual gridiron experience. Spy thriller ""Alpha Protocol"" will also satisfy PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 fans' inner Jack Bauer, combining exotic settings, in-depth character customization and detailed stat-crunching with atmospheric espionage. Sci-fi fans should also have a look at ""Transformers: War for Cybertron"" on the PC and all major console platforms. It's predictable, but delves deeper into the Autobots' and Decepticons' origins. Freeform blaster ""Crackdown 2"" for the Xbox 360 is sure to make you feel positively superhuman, too, leaping tall buildings and annihilating adversaries as a futuristic lawman. Golden age mob yarn ""Mafia II"" for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 further makes an offer you can't refuse, offering open-ended adventures in the vein of underworld classics like ""Goodfellas."" Handheld gaming enthusiasts also have it good thanks to titles like ""Puzzle Quest 2"" for the Nintendo DS and DSi, which blends fantasy role-playing and casual mindbenders together in a surprisingly addictive medieval epic. Creepy DS first-person survival horror outing ""Dementium II"" will additionally have you on the edge of your car or plane seat as well. While the PlayStation Portable's lineup is noticeably more anemic, military-themed stealth action offering ""Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker"" successfully shoots to thrill. Demonic role-player ""Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 Portable"" should be on every fan of Japanese imports' list to boot. So, maybe summer can't compete with the holidays in terms of sheer volume of games. But never fear -- the gaming season is still bound to be hot.","""Madden NFL 11"" streamlines decision-making for a faster virtual gridiron experience .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Six months after an earthquake devastated Haiti, a United Nations representative on the ground there says many challenges still lie ahead in the aftermath of the ""worst living disaster."" Nigel Fisher, the deputy special representative for the stabilization mission in Haiti, told the U.N. press via video-conference Monday that progress has been made in rehabilitating the country, but that the nation still faces many problems. The January 12 quake left over 220,000 dead, over 300,000 injured, and over a million homeless. According to recent U.N. reports, the quake destroyed 60 percent of government infrastructure, and left more than 180,000 homes uninhabitable. Six months later, more than 1.5 million remain in overcrowded displacement camps, and Fisher does not anticipate the number in camps to reduce soon. According to the United Nations, 1,300 camping sites and 11,000 latrines have been built, and thousands of kilos of food and humanitarian resources have been delivered to those in need. Fisher said that despite a lack of communication, destroyed roads and lack of transportation and railway systems, food was delivered relatively quickly to displaced Haitians. The response from the international community, Fisher said, was ""quite significant."" Houses that were not structurally damaged are being rebuilt at a relatively low cost, though tents and camps are undergoing their second ""phase of replacement."" An unforeseen difficulty of ""land tenure,"" especially in a ""place where land ownership has been disputed for years,"" has significantly slowed down the process of building more permanent houses in preparation for the hurricane season. ""It is important to remember what Haiti was and what Port-au-Prince was before the earthquake: two-thirds of the population was living in poverty, many lacked access to clean water and were living in slums,"" Fisher said. According to 2009 U.N. reports, 55 percent of Haitians lived on less than $1.25 a day, and per capita annual income was US $660. Fifty-eight percent of children were under-nourished and 58 percent of the population lacked access to clean water. The earthquake followed the devastating 2008 hurricanes that affected 800,000 Haitians, and deforestation left the country with less than 2 percent forest cover. ""Then, the catastrophic earthquake left 230,000 dead, 300,000 injured and an estimated one million homeless. In addition, 17 million cubic meters of debris were scattered on the streets,"" Fisher explained. Fisher said the relocation of displaced families from the camps to newly built homes has posed a problem because of two main concerns on the part of family members: the need for a job and for a nearby school where their children could receive an education. Furthermore, the private sector, which has been damaged by the ""overwhelming response from the international community,"" has experienced a loss of clients and ""extremely high interest rates"" that Fisher said can be solved only through recapitalization of the private sector by the country itself. But with a focus more on urban reconstruction and the development of a closer link between government and education, Fisher said Haiti could become a better nation than it was before the earthquake. ""We have a long way to go, but things could have been much worse."" Nutritional status and general health ""has not worsened in the months since the earthquake,"" he said. ""There has been no epidemic of cholera or measles,"" Fisher stated, because access to clean water and free medical facilities have reduced chances of an outbreak. He asserted even that the U.N. mission has seen improvement in some of the camps.","U.N. rep in Haiti says progress has been made but many problems still ahead .

"(CNN) -- Like many voters on Election Day, Nurul Aman and his family dutifully rose before sunrise and headed to the polls in Andover, Massachusetts, to cast their votes. Nurul, Nilufur and Samuel Aman voted as a family for Barack Obama in their first presidential election this year. But this election was especially significant for Aman, wife Nilufur and son Samuel, who were all voting for the first time. ""As the first-time voter, it was emotionally remarkable to perform my civic duty,"" said Aman, a Bangladeshi native who became a U.S. citizen in 2005. ""I felt great taking the ownership of this voting process that created a historic moment for the nation and the world."" As a family, the Amans represented two major groups from the bloc of first-time voters, which accounted for roughly 11 percent of this year's electorate. Samuel Aman is a college student, and his parents, both in their 50s, are recent citizens. An overwhelming majority of first-time voters, including the Amans, voted for Sen. Barack Obama over Sen. John McCain by a margin of 69 to 31 percent, CNN exit polls show. For Aman, a business and economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, it was an easy choice. He felt that Obama's campaign reflected a ""paradigm shift"" that would restore the American dream that had drawn Aman to the United States as a post-graduate student in the 1980s. ""I expect Obama will restore the American dream and create economic security by creating new jobs in new fields like alternative energy, science and math, global warming and health care. That is the only way economy can get back on track,"" Aman said. Aman's views reflect those of first-time voters who were drawn to Obama for his pledges to restore the America dream. Now, with Obama headed for the White House, first-time voters are hoping he will stick to his campaign promises. Alex Patel became a citizen in 1995, but he wasn't inspired to vote until now because of America's deteriorating image abroad. ""This time, I felt it was very important to vote, because I saw where the country was heading, in a very opposite direction from the rest of world,"" said Patel, who moved to the Houston, Texas, area from India with his parents in 1990. Patel said Obama campaigned on issues that were important to him: working with allies on security issues, energy concerns, civil rights issues like closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and withdrawing troops from Iraq. For young voters, discontent over the Iraq war emerged as a key issue, according to CNN exit polls. ""The first thing I want Obama to do is to get our men out of Iraq; that's all that really matters to me right now,"" Clara Baldwin, a sophomore majoring in secondary education in English at Gallaudet University in Washington, wrote in an e-mail. ""We have really spent a lot on war; why not focus on our own economy?"" Like many college students, Baldwin also considered the candidates' positions on issues that affect her directly. As a deaf person, she looked for the candidates' disability plans and could find one only for Democrats. Gillian McGrath, a Temple University senior who is studying social work, hopes Obama will make good on his promise to implement funding for social services so that she can do her job -- if she finds one. ""A lot of families can't afford food and need food stamps and health care, even just child care so they can finish school or go to work,"" said McGrath, who volunteers with children at her local Police Athletic League. ""I'm hoping he'll start taking out troops and create more jobs, especially within social service agencies, because I'm going to need a job when I get out of school."" About 66 percent of voters between the ages of 18 to 29 cast ballots for Obama, a number attributed to his campaign's use of new media, including the Internet and mobile media. But equally inviting among young voters was his fresh perspective and direct appeals to them to become engaged in the process. ""The fact that Obama appealed so much to the youth to make us feel like our voices count, they've grown to idolize him. That's what kind of sparked my interest. He really mobilized youth,"" said Sophia Le Fraga, a freshman at New York University. For many new citizens struggling with English, the act of casting a vote was their own form of civic commitment. ""When you don't speak English, it's difficult to be heard, but the person who votes speaks for himself and the community,"" said Ysidra Frias, a Dominican living in Lynn, Massachusetts, who became a U.S. citizen in January 2007. After becoming a citizen, Frias became active in the Massachusetts-based community organization Neighbor 2 Neighbor, which helped register 1,111 voters in low-income neighborhoods throughout the state. Frias said that for minorities like her, Obama was a sympathetic voice who understood the pervasive effect of poverty, unemployment and lack of social services in their communities. ""He talks about creating sources of employment and social programs, but he also talks about how the communities must help themselves,""said Frias, who plans to continue working for Neighbor 2 Neighbor to help bring about the changes Obama has promised. ""To give a plate of food to the hungry doesn't help, because where does the next meal come from? Obama gives us hope for finding the tools to help ourselves."" Then there were others who were dislodged from political apathy by the prospect of casting a historic ballot for the first African-American president. ""I actually started paying attention because Obama was a black man running, but once I started listening, he started making sense to me, and I decided to get out there and vote,"" said Michael Fogle, an African-American grocery store stocker and father of five from Lexington, Kentucky. Those who voted for McCain are less optimistic about what an Obama presidency will do for them. ""I hope he succeeds, simply because I care for our country too much, but I don't really expect him to,"" said Keith Neely, a senior at Brentwood High School in Brentwood, Tennessee. ""More specifically, I'm unsure as to which Obama will be inaugurated in January. Will it be the more liberal Democratic primary Obama, or will it be the more moderate general election Obama?"" Neely said in an e-mail to CNN.com. ""I firmly believe that Barack Obama has the ability to be a successful president, but that depends entirely on his willingness to stick to his campaign promises and avoid the temptation that an extremely liberal congress will provide.""","First-time voters such as students, new citizens made up 11 percent of electorate .

"(CNN) -- On January 12, I went to basketball practice and then spent time with a kids' basketball league. The whole time my phone was in the car. When I finally looked at it, I had about 50 messages saying, ""Have you been watching the news about Haiti?"" It still haunts me to think that, as I went about my business that day, my homeland shuddered, crashed, and crumbled. More than 220,000 of my fellow Haitians died. Another 1.6 million were instantly left homeless -- most with nothing but the clothes on their backs. About 800,000 of them are children. Haiti has never been an easy place to be a kid. When I was growing up in Port-au-Prince, I felt lucky because I always had at least one meal a day. Some of my friends were starving. But we all shared what we had with each other. We figured out ways to have fun with nothing but a small patch of dirt to play in. We got along with very little, and we told ourselves that -- if we got just the slightest opportunity -- we would grab onto it and use it to do great things. That is what Haiti's children need now. They need opportunity. They need our help. It is amazing what kids can endure. Haiti's children have held the hands of parents as they lay crushed and dying beneath rubble. They've lost families, best friends, homes, schools. They can survive all that. But they can't thrive without us stepping up. Right after the earthquake, the immediate and enormous generosity from people in the U.S. made such a difference in Haiti -- and it made me very proud to be part of this huge-hearted nation. Organizations like UNICEF, which I have partnered with for years through my Samuel Dalembert Foundation, were able to provide emergency relief that stopped another wave of disaster in the form of disease and starvation. In the last six months, UNICEF has been providing water, food, shelter, immunizations, medicines, child protection, and education supplies to hundreds of thousands of Haitian children and their families. But in many ways, the hard work is just beginning. And the need remains huge. Those 1.6 million people left homeless are still living in tents and makeshift shelters -- and hurricane season is fast approaching. More than one third of the spontaneous settlements that have been created lack adequate sanitation, and this can make kids ill and lead to major disease outbreaks. People in settlements still rely on water being trucked in every day, and many don't get enough considering the near 100-degree heat. Learn more about helping Haiti at Impact Your World . Education is going to make all the difference to Haiti's future. Given the opportunity to learn, the children who survived the earthquake will grow up to transform their nation and lead it towards prosperity. But before the earthquake, only four in ten kids went to school, and that number is even lower now. Teachers are also absent because so many lost their homes and are now displaced. I was lucky enough to get the opportunity I dreamed of as a child in Haiti. And I started my foundation because I wanted to give other kids that chance, too. It's my deep belief that those who are lucky enough to have success in this life should do something -- anything -- to help others. So I ask: Even if you've already been generous, don't forget Haiti now that it's dropped from the news headlines. Organizations like UNICEF are there for kids, but they need funds to rebuild schools, train teachers, set up feeding centers, immunize against disease, dig wells, install water pumps... There are hundreds of thousands of very resilient kids in Haiti who are surviving despite all they've been through. They can endure a lot. Parents dying. Living in tents in 100-degree weather and rainstorms. Hungry bellies. But we don't want a nation of kids just barely surviving -- we want a nation of leaders. Haiti's children can't become leaders if they don't go to school. They can't become leaders if they're so hungry they can't concentrate. Or if they have to spend their days selling sodas in the street to make a few pennies. They can't become leaders if the water they drink makes them chronically sick. Or if they never get the vaccines that will keep deadly diseases away. If you join me in giving Haiti's kids the opportunities they deserve, I can promise they will do great things. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Samuel Dalembert.","As Haiti recovers from January quake, children bear a heavy burden, says Samuel Dalembert .

"(CNN) -- The mother and father of missing Oregon boy Kyron Horman repeatedly urged stepmother Terri Horman to co-operate with police during a news conference Thursday. ""I really want her to do the right thing,"" said Kyron's mother, Desiree Young. ""Kyron is still out there and needs to be home."" Court records released Thursday revealed that Kaine Horman, the boy's father, believes the stepmother is involved in Kyron's disappearance. The revelation was made public after a restraining order against Terri Horman was unsealed by Multnomah County court authorities in Portland. The father alleges his wife knows what happened to Kyron, who was last seen at school more than one month ago. ""I believe respondent is involved in the disappearance of my son Kyron who has been missing since June 4,"" Horman wrote in his request for the restraining order. ""I also recently learned that respondent attempted to hire someone to murder me. The police have provided me with probable cause to believe the above two statements to be true."" The restraining order bars Terri Horman from having any contact with Kaine Horman or the couple's 20-month-old daughter. When asked by reporters at the Thursday news conference in Beaverton, Oregon, how he processed the information discovered in the restraining order he said, ""I didn't process it. It's not important right now. Kyron is still missing. He's still missing."" This is the second time in a week that the boy's biological parents pleaded with the stepmother to work with investigators. But there have not been any changes since the earlier request, said Young. ""She is still not co-operating."" ""I'm so angry, I don't have the words,"" said Young. ""She is not taking an active role in trying to find Kyron. She is not telling the truth."" ""I've known her for a long time, said Young, ""I know she's lying."" All three adults have taken polygraph tests as the investigation into Kyron's disappearance continues, said Kaine. Terri Horman was subjected to two, but did not pass either, he said. Young and Kaine Horman said they have been totally blindsided by the disappearance of their son and by the events that followed. Terri Horman's lawyer could not be reached for comment later Thursday. Lt. Mary Lindstrand said the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office had no comment on the allegations made by Kaine Horman. Authorities have not named any suspect or person of interest in connection with Kyron's disappearance. Asked if the department believes Kyron is alive, Lindstrand said, ""We are going with the premise, that, yes, Kyron is alive and we are going to bring him home."" Relatives of Kyron have said they are trying to keep the focus on finding the boy and not suspicions about the boy's stepmother. Kyron went missing after Terri Horman dropped him off at school on June 4. The stepmother said she last saw Kyron walking down a hallway toward his second-grade classroom at Skyline Elementary School in Portland, according to police. Sources told CNN affiliates that investigators believe that Terri Horman has lied to them, and cell phone records could show she wasn't where she claimed to be. Kyron's family members said they hope people will focus more on the missing boy. ""Our main goal is to keep Kyron in the front of everyone's mind because we have a better chance of finding him. So we are constantly working to keep him the focus of the story and not Terri,"" the family members said in an e-mail. Terri Horman was in the headlines Monday when CNN affiliates KGW and KATU reported that she had attempted to hire a landscaper to kill her husband several months ago. KGW reported that sources believe Terri Horman approached the landscaper, who had been working on the family's property in northwest Portland, and offered the man ""a large sum of money"" to kill Kaine Horman. Repeated efforts by CNN to reach Terri Horman have been unsuccessful. CNN's Gabriel Falcon contributed to this report.","NEW: Kyron Horman's parents urge stepmother to co-operate with police .

"(CNN) -- Two of three American hikers who have been detained in Iran for nearly 10 months -- Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd -- have gotten engaged in prison and plan to get married after their release, their relatives said Monday. The third hiker, Josh Fattal, plans to be best man at the wedding, the relatives said in a statement. The three hikers' mothers learned of the engagement when they visited Bauer, Shourd and Fattal in Iran last week. ""Shane told me that he proposed to Sarah in the yard of Evin prison on January 6, the very same day that we applied for our visas to go visit them,"" Bauer's mother, Cindy Hickey, said in the written statement. ""We're all so overjoyed at the news but it's obviously impossible to know when the wedding will take place."" The couple wears engagement rings that Bauer made from threads he pulled from his shirt, the statement said. ""Sarah couldn't wait to show me her ring,"" said Shourd's mother, Nora Shourd. ""It's one of the things that keeps her going -- knowing that she and Shane have this unbreakable bond and a friend in Josh who will always be there for them."" Iranian authorities detained the three after they reportedly crossed the border into Iran by accident while hiking in Iraqi Kurdistan. On Sunday, Iran's intelligence minister said the three Americans are spies, but he hinted that Iran may consider releasing them in exchange for the release of Iranian prisoners, state media reported. ""We expect the Americans, who claim to be advocates of human rights, to also commit humanitarian acts, because only after this can we decide on whether or not to have a swap,"" Iranian Intelligence Minister Heydar Moslehi said, according to the IRNA news agency. Speaking on the sidelines of a Cabinet meeting, Moslehi said there had been no official talks about a swap, Iranian state television reported. The trio made a brief phone call home March 9 and have had access to a few letters and messages sent by relatives, friends and supporters. They have not been formally charged, although Iranian officials have said they will face trial on espionage charges. Before their trip, the mothers had requested meetings with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but those meetings did not take place, according to the hikers' attorney.","Relatives: Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd to marry after release .

"(CNN) -- Day-long clashes between police and rioters marked a controversial holiday march in Northern Ireland, leaving dozens of officers injured and widespread damage in Belfast. The violence began overnight, on the eve of July 12, known as ""The Twelfth"" by Protestants who march to celebrate the victory of English king William III over his ousted Catholic predecessor James II in 1689. More than 100 riot police removed Catholic protesters from a road in north Belfast to allow the march to take place, journalist Peter Taggart told CNN Monday. Rioters pelted police with Molotov cocktails and other explosives, and officers fired baton rounds and used water cannon in attempts to break up the crowds, police said. A policewoman was struck in the head by an object thrown at her, and ambulance crews who rushed to the scene were confronted by rioters, police said. Her condition was unknown. Several vehicles were carjacked and set afire, police said. Police have not yet released details of the number of arrests made, or the number of people injured. However, authorities earlier in the day reported that at least 27 police officers were injured in the clashes. The injuries are not thought to be serious, police spokesman John Anderson had said. The violence took place in two different parts of the city on the eve of a holiday often marked by tension between Catholics and Protestants. Tensions in Northern Ireland as marching season begins . The disruption began minutes before the start of the holiday -- also known as ""Orangeman's Day."" Because of the sectarian nature of the holiday, celebrations have sometimes been marred by violence in the past. ""This is utterly wrong and I condemn it in the strongest possible terms,"" police district Chief Superintendent Mark Hamilton said in a statement early Monday. ""Those involved in tonight's violence were intent on causing mayhem and destruction."" Hamilton said police were investigating the incident. ""We have appealed for calm in the run up to the Twelfth of July and we continue to do so,"" he said. ""We would appeal to anyone with influence in the community to exert it to ensure that the next few days pass off without incident."" On Saturday, police in Northern Ireland said a roadside bomb that exploded in a border caused significant damage to both a road and a nearby bridge. District Cmdr. Chief Alasdair Robinson said he believed that police officers were the target, and that the bomb was placed in the area in an attempt to injure or kill them.","Rioters attack police on historic Protestant holiday .

"(CNN) -- A United States soldier captured by the Taliban says in a video posted on the Internet he is ""scared I won't be able to go home."" Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl shown here in a video made by his captors, members of the Taliban. The soldier was identified Sunday by the Pentagon as Pfc. Bowe R. Bergdahl, 23, of Ketchum, Idaho. He was captured June 30 from Paktika province in southeastern Afghanistan. The Taliban has threatened to kill Bergdahl if foreign troops continue targeting civilians in the name of search operations in Ghazni and Paktika province, Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said by telephone Friday after being contacted by CNN at an undisclosed location. NATO-led forces in Afghanistan and the U.S. military have repeatedly denied targeting civilians. In the 28-minute video, Bergdahl becomes emotional when he speaks of his family -- his parents, siblings, nieces and nephew -- and the girlfriend he hopes to marry. ""I have a very, very good family that I love back home in America, and I miss them every day that I'm gone,"" he says. ""I miss them and I'm afraid I might never see them again and that I'll never be able to tell them I love them again. I'll never be able to hug them."" He adds that he is ""scared. I'm scared I won't be able to go home. It is very unnerving to be a prisoner."" However, he says his captors are treating him ""like a guest."" It was not clear whether some or all of Bergdahl's remarks were scripted by his captors.  Watch excerpt from the video » . The last few minutes of the video show him eating a meal. In a statement released Sunday through the Idaho National Guard, Bergdahl's family said, ""We hope and pray for our son's safe return to his comrades and then to our family, and we appreciate all the support and expressions of sympathy shown to us by our family members, our friends and others across the nation. Thank you, and please continue to keep Bowe in your thoughts and prayers."" Asked by his captors if he had any message for Americans, the soldier says, ""To my fellow Americans who have loved ones over here, who know what it's like to miss them, you have the power to make our government bring them home. Please, please bring us home so we can be back where we belong and not over here."" The Taliban earlier claimed responsibility for Bergdahl's kidnapping, the military said. Last week, the U.S. military distributed pamphlets in eastern Afghanistan in an effort to locate him. ""As you can see, the American soldier is in good shape and good health, and he is being treated well based on the guidelines of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan regarding war prisoners,"" said a statement on Islamist Web sites accompanying the video. ""Any decision regarding the American soldier will be the specialty of the high order of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, may God protect him."" The U.S. military said it believed Bergdahl may have been moved to various locations. In the video, Bergdahl's captor makes reference to his being moved from Paktika to Khandahar. He acknowledges it, saying the move was accomplished ""very easily."" The claim could not be independently verified. Asked the date by his captor, Bergdahl says it is July 14. Two versions of the pamphlets were distributed in Afghanistan, written in the Pashto language. They were made available to CNN by U.S. Forces Afghanistan. One shows the image of an American soldier shaking hands in a group of kids with the message, ""One of our American guests is missing. Return the guest to his home. Call us at"" -- and lists a phone number. The other shows a U.S. soldier kicking down a door, and then an outstretched hand with the superimposed image of a soldier, his head and arms drooping, and the words, ""If you do not release the U.S. soldier then ... you will be hunted,"" the pamphlet says. Days after Bergdahl went missing, a senior U.S. military official said Bergdahl and the Afghan soldiers were captured by low-level militants and then quickly ""sold"" to the clan and network led by warlord Siraj Haqqani -- believed to be deeply involved in the action. The Haqqani clan operates on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistani border and is well known to the U.S. military. Bergdahl apparently left his small outpost on his own on June 30 with no apparent means of defending himself, the official said. Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said he visited a military post in the Yousaf Khel district in the Paktika province, got drunk, and was ambushed while returning to his car. Sangeen said the soldier was taken to a safe place. CNN could not independently verify Sangeen's claims. A source with the U.S. military denied the claim that Bergdahl was drunk. ""The Taliban are known for lying and what they are claiming (is) not true,"" the source said. In the video, Bergdahl says he was captured as he was lagging behind a patrol. Ketchum Mayor Randy Hall told CNN Sunday, ""Right now, the news is still breaking through town, and as the mayor, I can say this is a community situation."" But, he said, ""I trust the leadership of this country, the wisdom of the people who are serving and the decisions that led up to the situation."" Bergdahl is not a National Guardsman, according to the Idaho National Guard statement, but the organization said it was coordinating with the Department of Defense to provide public affairs duties and other assistance to the Bergdahl family. The family has requested privacy, the statement said. CNN's Barbara Starr and journalist Janullah Hashimzada contributed to this report.","Soldier from Idaho says he's frightened he won't be able to see family again .

"(CNN) -- A man arrested in connection with the 1990 abduction, rape and attempted murder of an 8-year-old girl appeared before a judge Thursday on an attempted capital murder charge, according to CNN affiliate KTRK. Dennis Earl Bradford, a 40-year-old welder, was arrested after DNA tied him to the crime, police say. Dennis Earl Bradford waived his right to a court-appointed attorney when he appeared Thursday, saying he would retain his own. For security reasons, the hearing was held at the Galveston (Texas) County Jail and not in a courtroom, the station reported. The judge ordered Bradford to undergo a physical and mental evaluation and set bail at $1 million. His next court appearance was set for Wednesday, according to KTRK. Upon conviction, an attempted capital murder charge could result in a sentence of life in prison. Bradford, a 40-year-old welder, was arrested early Tuesday in Little Rock, Arkansas, in connection with the 1990 incident involving Jennifer Schuett, who was abducted from her bedroom, raped and left for dead in Dickinson, Texas. Schuett shared her story with CNN two weeks ago in hope of someday bringing her attacker to justice. CNN normally does not identify victims of sexual assault, but Schuett decided to go public with her story to increase the chances of finding and prosecuting her attacker. ""It's not about me anymore,"" she told CNN in September. ""It's about all the little girls that go to sleep at night. I know there are so many girls out there who have been raped and hurt. You have to fight back."" Bradford's arrest came after DNA and other forensic tests led police to him, authorities said. ""This is a huge day for me,"" Schuett told CNN on Tuesday. ""And I want to see this through the end. The rest will come out during the trial."" Schuett said she was alone in her bed August 10, 1990, when a man crept in through a window. She remembers waking up in a stranger's arms as he carried her across a dark parking lot. She said he told her he was an undercover cop and knew her family. He drove her through the streets of Dickinson, pulling into a mechanic's shop next to her elementary school. ""Watch the moon. The moon will change colors, and that is when your mom will come to get you,"" she recalled him saying. ""Oh, it looks like she is not coming."" Schuett said he drove her to an overgrown field next to the school and sexually assaulted her. She passed out. When she regained consciousness, she was lying naked on top of an ant hill with her throat slashed from ear to ear and her voice box torn. She was found at 6 p.m. on a hot August day after lying in the field for nearly 12 hours. She was rushed to a hospital in critical condition. ""Three days after the attack, I started giving a description. The doctors told me I would never be able to talk again, but I proved them all wrong,"" Schuett said. She believes that she got her voice back so she could tell her story. Houston FBI Special Agent Richard Rennison is one of the lead investigators in the case, along with Dickinson Police Detective Tim Cromie. Both men were discussing the case when Rennison received a memo from the FBI's Child Abduction Rapid Deployment (CARD) team, seeking child abduction cases that had gone cold and could be retested for DNA evidence. Schuett's was one of the cases selected. ""This is the only one that I can think of that the victim has suffered some traumatic injuries and survived,"" Rennison said. ""The main reason the CARD team picked this case was because she was alive. In cases of child abduction, it is rare that the child is recovered alive. Frequently, you recover a body. And most times, you never find them."" The investigators found evidence collected 19 years ago, which was retested. It included the underwear and pajamas Schuett was wearing, as well as a man's underwear and T-shirt, which were found in the field where Schuett was found. The clothes were tested in 1990, but the sample wasn't large enough for conclusive results. But now, modern techniques allow DNA to be isolated from a single human cell. They were still awaiting the results when CNN featured Schuett's story in late September. CNN's Mayra Cuevas-Nazario contributed to this report.","40-year-old held on $1 million bail in girl's abduction, rape, attempted killing .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. reinforced its close ties with Jordan this week by increasing aid to the Kingdom by 48 percent. MME spoke with Dr. Bassem I. Awadallah, Chief of the Royal Hashemite Court, about Jordan's relationship with the U.S. Washington says the increase in aid to $663 million this year shows ""the bipartisan support in America for the difficult choices Jordan has made in its homegrown reform efforts."" Jordan has been a close political ally of the U.S. for decades. The strength of their relationship was recognised in 2000 when Jordan became the first Arab country to sign a free trade deal with the U.S. When Jordan's King Abdullah bin al-Hussein II came to power in 1999, he put economic reform at the top of his agenda. Since then, the Kingdom has moved to liberalize trade, eliminate fuel subsidies, crack down on corruption and reform the tax system. Dr. Bassem I. Awadallah is a former economic advisor to the Prime Minister of Jordan. He's now Chief of the Royal Hashemite Court, and Vice Chairman of the King Abdullah II Fund for Development. John Defterios spoke with Bassem Awadallah and asked him whether the increase in U.S. aid to Jordan is recognition of the role that Jordan's been playing in the Middle East, both economically and politically. Bassem Awadallah (BA): There is a definite recognition of what Jordan has been doing over the last two years. Particularly the efforts that have been conducted by His Majesty the King over the last two years in helping to bring the peace process on track again. But equally, there is recognition in Washington, as elsewhere in the world, of the reforms that are taking place in Jordan. (Recognition) of what we are trying to do with fiscal management, enabling the investment environment to become much better, and to attract private capital to come in and invest in key sectors of our economy. As a result of this, we have witnessed an increase in the assistance levels from the United States and we hope that this will continue over the next couple of years. (JD): One could say that U.S. relations in the Middle East specifically in the Gulf are at a historic low. Does this one-week tour by President Bush really alter the outlook between U.S. and Middle East relations? (BA): To the extent that the Arab countries and the Arab people feel that the United States is committed to play an honest broker and bring about a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian issue, which we feel to be the core issue in the Arab Israeli conflict. To the extent that we see a deliverable on the ground, which means a real improvement in the lives of Palestinians and a real commitment to the peace process. I think you will have a substantial increase in the credibility that the United States commands on the Arab Street. This is the major factor in our opinion that really provides for the U.S. image to be improved in the Arab countries. (JD): It was a historic week if you look at the big picture: an arms and missile deal worth $20 billion with Saudi Arabia; and at the same time, Gulf investment funds investing in Merrill Lynch and Citigroup. Do you think eventually this will lead to investment protectionism where there's resistance to this money coming from the Gulf and into U.S. and European Markets? (BA): I think you're going to see a real financial power in the Gulf countries. Obviously, they will be able to afford to develop their economies more. I think they are going to feel that the regional threats are of such magnitude that they would be required to arm themselves more, and this explains why there have been big contracts, not only with the United States, but other countries as well in Europe. You are going to have some kind of recycling going on which is clearly manifested in the Merrill Lynch and Citigroup investments by Sovereign Wealth Funds. We do hope that these big funds in the Gulf will find some attractive opportunities in the Arab World as well -- in Jordan, in other countries which do require this huge capital investments to improve the infrastructure and to be invested in key sectors of our economies.

"(CNN) -- Bristol Palin and the father of her child, Levi Johnston, are engaged again. The couple reconciled three months ago during custody discussions about their 18-month-old son, Tripp, Us Weekly magazine reported Wednesday. According to the magazine, the couple said Bristol Palin's mother, former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, did not know about their plans until now. ""We got engaged two weeks ago,"" the magazine quoted Bristol Palin as saying. ""It felt right, even though we don't have the approval of our parents."" She acknowledged in the article that ""it is intimidating and scary just to think about what her reaction is going to be,"" adding: ""Hopefully she will jump on board."" The Palin family issued a statement later Wednesday that stopped short of a full-throated endorsement. ""Bristol, at 19, is now a young adult,"" said the statement attributed to the Palin family. ""As parents we obviously want what is best for our children, but Bristol is ultimately in charge of determining what is best for her and her beautiful son."" The family statement added that ""Bristol believes in redemption and forgiveness to a degree most of us struggle to put in practice in our daily lives."" ""We pray that, as a couple, Bristol and Levi's relationship matures into one that will allow Tripp to grow up graced with two loving parents in his life,"" the statement said. According to the magazine, Johnston, 20, had no expectations of a reconciliation when he and Bristol Palin got together to discuss custody arrangements involving their son. ""I really thought we were over. So when I went, I had no hope,"" the magazine quoted Johnston as saying. ""I think we both just started talking -- and then we took Tripp for a walk."" Us Weekly Senior Editor Lindsey Powers told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Wednesday that ""they opened up to us about how they had the baby so young and it was really hard for them to work together to raise Tripp."" ""But as they got a little bit closer, Bristol moved out of her parents' home to a condo in Anchorage, they got accustomed to parenting and as they worked out a custody plan, they started spending a lot more time together then started realizing they wanted to reunite,"" Powers said. The engagement ""would fit in with (Sarah Palin's) 'family values' platform,"" Powers said. ""What better than to have your daughter reuniting with the father of the baby and reuniting the family?"" Johnston sent Bristol Palin a text that said, ""I miss you. I love you. I want to be with you again"" and she was in shock, Powers confirmed to CNN. ""They realized that they're really in love and they're together. And she was thrilled when he popped the question with a one-carat diamond ring,"" Powers said. ""They say they want it to be quick so, certainly, we'll see them walking down the aisle shortly,"" Powers added. Their teenage relationship fell under an intense public spotlight after Sen. John McCain picked Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate in August 2008. The couple broke off their first engagement about two months after their son's birth in December 2008. After they broke up, Johnston posed in Playgirl Magazine and said on ""The Tyra Banks Show"" that they had been allowed to live together, a charge the Palin camp denied. Johnston irked Sarah Palin last fall by claiming that she referred to her infant son Trig, who has Down syndrome, as ""retarded."" According to Us Weekly, she fired back, telling reporters that anyone who posed for Playgirl would ""say and do anything for even more attention."" Later, during an interview with Oprah Winfrey, she called his ""aspiring porn"" career ""heartbreaking."" During a nasty custody battle last year, Johnston asked that the case be conducted in public to protect him from Sarah Palin, whom he said was ""powerful, politically ambitious and has a reputation for being extremely vindictive."" Bristol Palin said in the custody hearing that Johnston wanted a public case so he could ""continue to make a spectacle of this custody dispute for his own self-promotion."" Bristol Palin noted in the court case that Johnston's mother, Sherry Johnston, pleaded guilty to a felony drug charge this year. Bristol Palin asked that the paternal grandmother be barred from having any unsupervised visitation with Tripp. Her petition said she ""may re-offend, keep medications around the house which could be accessible to the baby, have illegal drug users come to the house (or she could take the baby in her car during a drug sale)."" Johnston's response said his mother's ""chronic pain condition is currently being managed in coordination with the Department of Corrections."" On July 7, Johnston publicly apologized to the Palin family in a statement to People Magazine, saying some of his comments about the family were not totally true. ""Last year, after Bristol and I broke up, I was unhappy and a little angry. Unfortunately, against my better judgment, I publicly said things about the Palins that were not completely true,"" Johnston told People. ""I have already privately apologized to Todd and Sarah. Since my statements were public, I owe it to the Palins to publicly apologize.""","NEW: The Palin family issues a statement wishing the couple well .

"Washington (CNN) -- The tale contains elements of a spy thriller: a soldier in Iran's feared Revolutionary Guard turns spy for the CIA after concluding that the government that had promised democracy had instead ushered in oppression, violence and death. But, Reza Kahlili says, this is no novel. In his new book, ""A Time to Betray: The Astonishing Double Life of a CIA Agent Inside the Revolutionary Guards of Iran,"" Kahlili offers a firsthand account of how he turned against the Islamic regime that he said has oppressed its people for three decades. In one of his first public appearances, Kahlili addressed a packed hall Friday at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Flanked by a bodyguard and disguised in a hat, mask and glasses, he spoke through a modulator that led Washington Post columnist David Ignatius to liken his voice to Darth Vader's. Even his name is a pseudonym, all in an effort to protect his family, friends and contacts, he said. The author said that, after a peaceful childhood in Iran, he came to the United States in the 1970s for college, studying computer science at the University of Southern California, where he enjoyed a carefree life of parties, watching football and listening to Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull. He returned home after the sudden death of his father to find a country embroiled in change. Kahlili describes the immediate aftermath of the 1979 revolution against Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi as a special time in Iran. Iranians had been led to believe democracy was theirs, the clergy wouldn't interfere in their lives and the people would have freedom of speech, assembly and political affiliation, he said. Everyone was excited about the direction of the country, he said. It was then that Khalili's friend told him about an opportunity with the newly formed, elite Revolutionary Guard, which hired him immediately. Reza said he quickly became disillusioned when he saw people being tortured and murdered and women raped in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison. Repressing his countrymen, he said, was not what he had signed up for. But rather than quit the Guard and endanger his family, he contacted the CIA and began work as an American agent under the code name ""Wally,"" he said. There was no magic watch or pen or fancy car like James Bond, he said, just a pencil and a notebook. He was trained in communications and deciphering codes. Kahlili said his role ""was to look and act the part of a devout Muslim enforcing all the new rules laid down by the mullahs."" ""A full black beard was a mandatory accessory to the Guard's uniform, and I sported one along with every other member of the Guards. The image of a scowling, black-bearded Guard in uniform mustered fear and garnered respect. Playing the part of a zealot did not come naturally to me, and there were times I had to do things I dreaded: cautioning young girls to cover up, barking at kids for not displaying proper Islamic behavior, taking on the persona of a fanatic. I knew I would have to try to convince myself that doing these things allowed me to maintain my role -- and maintaining my role allowed me to contribute to the downfall of the organization to which I so fervently imitated allegiance."" He said he provided critical information to his CIA handlers about Iran's role in the Iran-Iraq war, the Iran-contra affair, the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut and the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which he said was masterminded by Tehran. Kahlili described a CIA that knew little about what was going on inside Iran and was complacent about finding out the truth about the regime. He said he warned his case officers in the mid-1980s about the growing danger of the Guard, but said U.S. officials sat idly by, alternating indifference and negotiation with the regime he was working to take down. This ""misconception"" of Iran, he said, has plagued America's decisionmaking for three decades. After a few scares in which he thought his cover was blown, Kahlili left Iran, was granted asylum in the United States and moved to California. He said he no longer works for the CIA, but still provides the agency with information from his contacts in Iran about the regime, its nuclear program, its terrorist activities in the region and its continued oppression of the Iranian people. He said that, after the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2005 election of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadenijad, he decided to speak out publicly to raise awareness of the brutality of the regime. He predicted that Iran will eventually attack Israel, Europe and the Gulf and advocated a preemptive military strike against the regime but not against the Iranian people or infrastructure. Kahlili accused the Obama administration of naivete and betrayal for seeking to engage Iran. Not only does the regime see this as weakness on the part of the United States, he said, but the Iranian people view it as a betrayal of the highest order as they fight for freedom. ""Stop dreaming, please,"" he said Friday. ""You are not dealing with rational people. Every time you extend a hand, it is not seen as sincerity, but stupidity."" The CIA's public affairs office in Washington was not open Friday night and its telephone number would not accept messages; its e-mail account rejected two attempts to send it a message.","Ex-member of Iran's Revolutionary Guards describes life as a CIA spy .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Like most college students, Jake McCoy had to apply for several loans to pay for his education. After a rigorous check of his credit, he secured the loans and has been paying them back since graduating from Baylor University in May 2006. Then, in October 2008, he received a letter from Baylor with bad news: A laptop computer with his account information had either been stolen or misplaced. ""They told me my information was on it, and that's pretty much it,"" McCoy said. ""I assumed that my information was in good hands; it was so hard to get the loans that I figured surely they'd protect it very well."" The university set up a credit monitoring service for McCoy, now a first-year medical student at Baylor. The service expired in a year, and McCoy worries that he's still at risk for being on the hook for thousands of dollars that someone using his identity could spend. ""The biggest concern is always that you don't know what someone is going to do with your financial information,"" said McCoy. ""I was really worried that someone out there was going to be ruining my credit and how big of a headache it would be to resolve it."" And McCoy is not alone. In March, a portable media device with personal data for more than 3 million people was stolen from Minnesota-based Educational Credit Management Corp. It is believed to be the largest breach of its kind. The thieves who stole the USB drive, like in other cases, may not commit identity thefts themselves, according to Jonathon Giffin, a system and software security researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ""They may sell the information to others who have the knowledge of making money from those identities,"" Giffin said. Most credit card companies and banks offer some recourse if a customer becomes the victim of internet fraud. But when personal information is lost because a company is the victim of crime, it is often unclear who is ultimately responsible. There are U.S. laws that hold companies accountable when major breaches occur, and new legislation is being considered. The Personal Data Privacy Act of 2009 would require companies to notify, in writing, anyone affected by a security breach. Under the act, which is still pending a vote in Congress, companies would also be required to notify major media outlets if there are more than 5,000 people affected by a security breach. The company that carried McCoy's loans simply provided him with a basic $15 credit monitoring service that lasted for one year. ""For me, it's not a one-year ordeal,"" said McCoy. ""If I had ruined my credit, it would have taken me forever to get back on track. One year was a nice gesture, but I definitely wish it would have been more than just a year."" More than 350 million personal records at hundreds of universities, government agencies and businesses have been at risk because of data privacy breaches since 2005, according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit group that publishes reports on cybercrimes. Sometimes, that's a result of simple mistakes, and other times, it's the result of a criminal act. Either way, Giffin says everyone needs to protect their personal identity. ""We can encourage organizations to try to protect our data using mechanisms such as data encryption, so that if a USB drive or a laptop is stolen, the data is encrypted and cannot be retrieved,"" he said. ""But we would be relying on companies to do that for us."" Encryption causes a slowdown for companies. System users would have to encrypt and decrypt the data every time they access it, which creates extra work, and companies may not have an incentive to pay for safer data. New legislation could change the way companies look at data safety costs. The Data Accountability and Trust Act, which has been passed by the House and awaits a vote in the Senate, would protect consumers by requiring companies to take reasonable measures to protect data containing personal information. If a security breach occurs, companies would be required to provide nationwide notice. But even if the bill is enacted, it may not be enough. Many laws dealing with internet protection haven't always been able to catch up to evolving cybercrimes. But that doesn't mean there hasn't been any progress in the ongoing battle to protect personal data, according to Adam Palmer, the lead adviser on cybersecurity issues for Norton. ""There are some very good, tough laws right now on both the state and federal level, and there's a lot of legislation in the pipeline to try to address some of these crimes,"" said Palmer, a former cyber-crime prosecutor. But new challenges exist for fighting crime in a virtual world. Palmer says cybercriminals often use sophisticated technology to launch attacks. ""You can't go to a crime scene and take pictures and interview witnesses, so it's in some ways a very old crime that still relates to stealing money, stealing people's identities,"" he said. ""It's done with such complexities, that makes it very difficult for prosecutors."" Giffin says there has been a significant shift in cybercrime over the last decade, including new techniques such as ""botnets,"" which are computers that can transmit viruses to other computers without the knowledge of the owner. Although cybercriminals continue to develop new methods of attack, there are no new ways for users to protect themselves other than what experts have advised for years: . • Maintain good security practices . • Exercise greater awareness of how your information could be used . • Check credit reports . • Tell your financial institutions to track your accounts . • Report any cybercrimes to law enforcement . But even in doing so, consumers -- like McCoy -- still face a potential risk when their personal information is in the hands of others. McCoy says he is more careful with his information, and he hopes that businesses take more precautions with their customers' personal data. ""It still put that doubt in my mind about how easy it could be for businesses that I trust to lose my information or have it stolen,"" McCoy said. ""I don't know why they were carrying around information on a laptop. I feel like they should be a little more protective with information than that.""","Most credit card companies and banks offer help to victims of internet fraud .

"(CNN) -- A 14-year-old cruise passenger was killed in a crossfire Monday as she rode on a tour bus on the U.S. Virgin Islands, police said. Authorities said the shooting happened just before noon in the Coki Point area of St. Thomas. They found the girl wounded on the bus and a man who had been fatally shot in the street, police said in a statement. She was identified as Liz Marie Perez Chapparro of Puerto Rico by the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Tourism. Chapparro was taken to a hospital, where she died from her injuries, police said. The shootout between the unidentified man and the driver of a red Honda occurred at the funeral of Joseph Ferrari, who was shot to death at a mall parking lot on June 29. The driver in Monday's shooting ran away from the scene, police said. Three others were arrested as police searched the area. Police said they found ammunition on the dead man's body. Chapparro's family immediately flew home to Puerto Rico, the tourism department said.","Teen tourist killed in crossfire on St. Thomas .

"(CNN) -- A man who shot and killed two people at a fiber optics company in New Mexico Monday before turning the gun on himself has been identified as 37-year-old Robert Reza, a police spokesman told CNN Tuesday. Police responded to a 911 call Monday morning from Emcore Company that multiple shots had been fired. When officers entered the building, they found a total of seven people shot. Three were dead, including the shooter, said Nadine Hamby with the Albuquerque Police Department. Among the wounded victims was a woman who has been identified by police as the shooter's estranged girlfriend. Adrienne Basciano, 49, was in guarded condition Tuesday at the University of New Mexico Hospital, said Hamby. Michele Turner, 36, died at the scene and Sharon Cunningham, 47, died at the University of New Mexico Hospital, Hamby said. A woman and man, both 58, and a 54-year-old woman were released from the hospital. Conflicting information emerged in the hours after the shooting.  Authorities first reported that six people had died, and later said three people were killed.  Earlier reports also mistakenly identified the shooter as a woman.  Police said miscommunication among officers and emergency personnel was to blame for the erroneous reports. ""We believe this incident to be a domestic violence workplace situation,"" Albuquerque Police Chief Ray Schultz said Monday. Police also said that they have located the children of the gunman and his estranged girlfriend.  Schultz would only say that the children are ""OK."" The roughly 85 Emcore employees who were inside the building at the time of the shooting were later interviewed at a community center near the building, authorities said.","NEW: Police identify a gunman in New Mexico as Robert Reza, 37 .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Kenneth Slayton wants to get a message to Jaycee Dugard, the California woman kidnapped as a child and held captive for 18 years. Slayton would like to get together with Dugard and her two children on Father's Day, but he said he is being blocked from communicating with the 29-year-old he believes is his daughter. When Dugard went missing in 1991, FBI agents investigating the 11-year-old's disappearance knocked on Slayton's door because the truck driver had been identified as her biological father. Slayton said he was shocked by the FBI visit because until then he didn't know about Jaycee was his daughter. The 64-year-old truck driver said he was shocked again last August when he heard a radio report his long-lost daughter had been found alive. ""I almost wrecked my truck,"" Slayton said. But Dugard's return to her family did not include Slayton. He said he is desperately trying to change that. ""Since she has been found, I have done everything I could to make contact with Jaycee, but to no avail,"" Slayton said at a news conference Friday. Doing everything included hiring celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred. ""Sunday is Father's Day,"" Allred said. ""Our client has missed celebrating Father's Day for 29 years. He is thrilled that his daughter has been found alive and that he has two grandchildren he never even knew he had."" Several letters from Slayton sent to Dugard through her lawyer were returned unopened, he said. They included photos of his other children who would like to meet their sister, he said. Allred would not speculate on who decided not to open them. ""They only thing she knows about me is something that maybe somebody said that maybe didn't like me too well,"" Slayton said. ""That's wrong."" A spokeswoman for the Dugard family issued a statement recently which acknowledged Slayton as the father but questioned his motives for wanting into Dugard's life after many years. ""I was very upset by the verbal missiles that the spokesperson fired at me when she targeted me,"" Slayton said. ""I guess they're trying to kill my spirit, reputation issuing totally false statements. I mean, these things are over the hill."" ""The statement that I had no interest in Jaycee is a completely false statement,"" he said. ""Ever since I learned certainly that I had a daughter I wanted to see her, protect her and love her."" He said he never would have abandoned a daughter if he had known she existed. ""I'm not a runner."" ""I would have been there,"" Slayton said. ""I would have been a good loving father, and involved in supporting her and helping in any way that I could."" He filed a paternity suit last month. Legally establishing that he is her father would guarantee Slayton a courtroom seat when the couple charged with kidnapping Dugard are tried, Allred said. Phillip Garrido, 58, and his wife, Nancy, 54, are charged with 29 felony counts in the kidnapping of Dugard, who was 11 when she was snatched in 1991 from the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe, California. ""I am also a victim of Phillip Garrido because he kept me separated from my daughter and because he inflicted terrible pain on her,"" he said.","Slayton wants to legally prove he's Dugard's dad .

"(CNN) -- Leszek Balcerowicz, Poland's former finance minister, recently said his country is enjoying ""its best period in 300 years."" CNN looks at how the country emerged from communism to become one of eastern Europe's most stable and thriving democracies. Solidarity leader Lech Walesa addresses striking workers in Gdansk, Poland in 1989. Modern Poland gained independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union during the Second World War. Almost six million Poles, including the majority of the country's large Jewish population, died during the devastating six-year conflict. The shadow of Stalin continued to loom large over Poland after the war, when the communist-dominated government ensured that Poland would become a Soviet satellite state for the next 40 years. The following decades were punctuated by revolts against the repressive authoritarian regime in Warsaw, but none had a greater impact on Poland's political future than events in 1980 at a shipyard in western Poland. With a struggling economy and rumors of corruption and mismanagement within the state causing widespread discontent, a series of strikes by workers paralyzed the country. Eventually the government was forced to negotiate and on August 31, 1980, workers at the massive Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, led by an electrician named Lech Walesa, signed a deal giving workers the right to strike and form trade unions. This heralded the creation of the Solidarity movement, which would ultimately be instrumental in bringing Poland's communist era to an end. The presence in the Vatican at the time of Polish-born Pope John-Paul II was also a significant influence on the movement throughout the 1980s, as the Catholic church had remained a very potent force in Polish life. The Pope even made a visit to the country in 1979. Despite Soviet-endorsed attempts to slow the erosion of the regime's grip on power -- including the declaration of martial law by General Wojciech Jaruzelski in 1981 which outlawed Solidarity -- Poland's worsening economic situation, compounded by further nationwide strikes, meant that the government had no alternative but to negotiate a date for free elections with Walesa and the Solidarity movement. Solidarity members won a stunning victory in the election of 1989, taking almost all the seats in the Senate and all of the 169 seats they were allowed to contest in the Sejm or parliament. This gave them substantial influence in the new government. Activist and journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki was appointed prime minister, while Lech Walesa was elected as president the following year. After years of economic mismanagement under the communists, Poland embarked on a painful reform program under finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz -- especially in traditional heavy industries such as coal and steel -- which moved away from the inefficient state-controlled system of economic planning. Despite growing unemployment and a dilapidated infrastructure, Poland was slowly transformed into an investment-friendly, market economy. Banking and lending policies were reformed, while newly reshaped ownership relations, independent enterprises and strengthened domestic competition all had a massive impact. Over a relatively short period of time, Poland had become one of the most dynamically developing economies in Europe and by the mid-1990s, it became known as the ""Tiger of Europe."" Poland also liberalized its international trade during this period. The national currency -- the zloty -- became convertible to other currencies and internal convertibility was also established, providing another platform for dynamic economic growth. New markets in countries that had been treated not so long before as ideological as well as economic enemies were opened up to Polish companies. The EU and U.S. were now the key markets for Polish goods. This realignment of policy was emphasized by its accession into the European Union in 2004. It had also joined NATO in 1999. Unfortunately the continuing problem of high unemployment and the promise of better salaries encouraged many Poles to work in other EU countries after 2004. However this trend started to reverse in 2008 as the Polish economy enjoyed a boom period. Politically, Poland has also successfully transformed itself into a fully democratic country. Since 1991 the Polish people have voted in parliamentary elections and four presidential elections -- all free and fair. Incumbent governments have transferred power smoothly and constitutionally in every instance to their successors.","Poland was ruled by Soviet-backed regime after the Second World War .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The oldest known surviving copy of the New Testament gets the modern touch Thursday when parts of it go online for the first time. The full manuscript of the Codex Sinaiticus will be online a year from now. The British Library plans to begin publishing the Codex Sinaiticus, a 4th century text handwritten in Greek, on its Web site. The Gospel of Mark and the Book of Psalms go online Thursday. The full manuscript is to be online in a year. Translations of the Codex Sinaiticus have long been widely available, but publishing images of the manuscript online will let anyone see pages that, until now, have been viewed in detail mainly by academia. As the Web site becomes operational, it will show photographs of each page of the text, with links to translations in English and German. There will also be a search function. ""It contains the earliest complete copy of the New Testament,"" said Scot McKendrick, the head of Western Manuscripts at the British Library. While the Codex contains all of the New Testament, it also includes part of the Old Testament and originally contained the entire text of the Christian Bible. The manuscript also includes the Apocrypha, 14 disputed books of the Old Testament that are usually omitted from the Protestant Bible. It also includes two early Christian texts: the ""Epistle of Barnabas"" and the ""Shepherd of Hermas."" The library announced plans three years ago to digitize the 1,600-year-old book, a tough job since pieces of the manuscript reside in four countries. ""It was a challenge, but it was ... also very exciting,"" said Juan Garces, the curator of the project. Photographers took digital pictures of the text in United Kingdom, Russia, Germany and Egypt to put the entire manuscript online. ""It unites something that belongs together,"" he said. The complete text once was housed at the Monastery of St. Catherine in Sinai, Egypt, before it came to the attention of a German scholar, Constantine Tischendorf, in the 19th century. He took parts of it to Germany and Russia. The British Library later bought several hundred pages from the Russians. Digitizing the text is a windfall for scholars, but the main goal was to make the Codex available to everyone. ""It makes it accessible, and it opens up to anyone who can access it via the Internet,"" Garces added. Eventually, the manuscript will be translated into Russian and modern Greek. ""The user will come to the Web site and will be able to look at images of each page of Codex Sinaiticus, will be able to zoom in and out and look around the page and see the page lit in standard light."" Garces said.","British Library plans to publish world's oldest surviving Bible online .

"Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, Anderson Cooper goes to the Congo where he covered the killings of endangered mountain gorillas. Ten mountain gorillas reportedly have been killed in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the last year. NEW YORK (CNN) -- You hear them before you actually see them. Some branches snap just ahead of you. The adult male silverback grunts somewhere off to the side of you. He even pounds his chest. You approach slowly. Mountain gorillas have been used to seeing scientists for decades,  but these are wild animals, and you have to be respectful. When you see them, it is shocking. I've been visiting mountain gorillas since I was 17 -- I've probably been about six or seven times -- but each visit is extraordinary. They are among our closest animal relatives, and when you stare into their eyes, you see the spark of intelligence. You know these are individuals, with personalities, thoughts and feelings. Each gorilla group or family is headed by an adult male silverback. They are massive creatures, weighing up to 500 pounds, and are fiercely protective of their brood. Around them baby mountain gorillas tumble and play. They beat their chests just like their father, though the display is far less impressive. If you look closely, you may notice some of the mountain gorillas have lost a hand or a foot. Poachers' snares are a problem, even in a well-protected park in Rwanda I visited. There are about 700 mountain gorillas left in the world, according to Flora and Fauna International, an organization that acts to conserve threatened species and ecosystems, and they live in a lush forest that straddles Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Watch a close-up view of a mountain gorilla » . In Rwanda and Uganda, where they're well-protected, the mountain gorilla populations are thriving. They are major tourist attractions that bring millions of dollars each year to both countries. The real problem right now is in the Democratic Republic of Congo. For the last 10 years, there has been fighting in that country, and in the last year, according to the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 10 mountain gorillas have been killed, shot to death. We went to the Congo to find out why those mountain gorillas were murdered. And the answer is we just don't know. Because of the fighting, the mountain gorillas are completely cut off. The rangers who protect them have had to flee the park, and no one's been able to check up on the gorillas. What we do know, and what is so sad, is that these gentle giants trust us.

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A Miami, Florida, court appearance for Colton Harris-Moore, the so-called ""barefoot bandit,"" has been postponed until Friday, as he did not have a U.S.-based attorney to represent him Wednesday. Wearing government-issued socks, sandals and shackles, the 19-year-old Harris-Moore told the judge his mother hired an attorney whose name he did not know. Public defender Hector Topico offered to assist Harris-Moore in contacting the attorney in Washington state. Harris-Moore was taken into custody on Harbour Island in the Bahamas early Sunday. He was sought in a string of home and airport break-ins in various U.S. locations along with thefts of vehicles. In the Bahamas, Harris-Moore pleaded guilty to a charge of illegally landing a plane, paid a $300 fine and was ordered deported, his lawyer said. He was then flown to Miami on Tuesday, the FBI said. Typically in extradition cases, the accused makes a first appearance in the federal court closest to where he was arrested, said Emily Langlie, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Western District of Washington. The Southern District of Florida, in Miami, is the closest jurisdiction to the Bahamas, said Langlie. In his initial U.S. appearance, he will be told of his rights and read an initial charge of interstate transportation of stolen property, Langlie said. The complaint, which was sealed until last week, was filed last December and stems from his allegedly stealing a plane in Bonner's Ferry, Idaho, and crashing it outside Granite Falls, Washington, she said. After his initial appearance, U.S. marshals will take him to the Western District of Washington in Seattle. Under the federal system, the case will then go to a grand jury. If an indictment is returned, more charges could be filed. The federal charge of interstate transportation of stolen goods carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. Federal prosecutors are working with other states to determine the best way to go forward in this case, but the Washington courts will get him first since he was arrested on their warrant, Langlie said. ""He seems to be very remorseful,"" attorney Monique Gomez, a Bahamian lawyer who represented Harris-Moore in Nassau,  told CNN in a telephone interview. Asked whether he acknowledges guilt in the other cases, Gomez said, ""Let me put it this way -- he wishes he had done things a little differently in his life."" Still, she added, he appeared ""in good spirits."" Authorities in Madison County, Nebraska, issued an arrest warrant for Harris-Moore last month on charges of burglary and theft by unlawful taking or deception. The affidavit supporting the warrant alleges the youth waged a crime spree. He faces charges in Washington state in the theft of an aircraft, and police have said they believe he stole a Cessna in Indiana and flew it to the Bahamas, where it was found in the shallows off Abaco Island. The teen had been on the run since he escaped from a juvenile halfway house in Renton, Washington, in 2008. The FBI had offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Harris-Moore is called the ""barefoot bandit"" because he was without shoes when he allegedly broke into houses. He also was barefoot when apprehended in the Bahamas at the Romora Bay Resort and Marina by police responding to a reported sighting Sunday. The youth has amassed more than 80,000 Facebook fans. In December, Time magazine dubbed him ""America's Most Wanted Teenage Bandit."" Also, 20th Century Fox has purchased the rights for a film based on his exploits. CNN's Ashley Hayes, John Couwels, Patrick Oppmann, Susan Candiotti, Tom Watkins and InSession Correspondent Jean Casarez contributed to this report.","NEW: The hearing for Colton Harris-Moore will be held Friday .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A trio of wildfires burned through Southern California on Tuesday, threatening homes, shutting down roads and prompting some residents to evacuate, officials said. There were no reports of injuries from the three fires in Camarillo, Walnut and at Camp Pendleton. Capt. Ron Oatman of the Ventura County Fire Department estimated the fire in Camarillo -- about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles -- to be about 15-20 acres. Oatman said some homes were threatened, but residents were not yet evacuating. In Walnut, 25 miles east of Los Angeles, a 5-acre wildfire prompted residents in 24 homes to evacuate, though the fire was later extinguished without burning any structures, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Meanwhile, fire officials at Camp Pendleton -- home to a U.S. Marine Corps base north of San Diego -- had that blaze 60 percent contained Tuesday evening after it burned 2,700 acres. Firefighters expect to have it fully controlled Wednesday, according to a statement from the base. The Camp Pendleton fire, which started Tuesday morning during a training exercise, forced the closure of at least one road that will remain closed through the night, the statement said.

"(CNN) -- Break out your D20s and your ""New Mutants"" collection! It's ""Embrace Your Geekness Day,"" and Wall Street embraced geeks by letting them ring the starting bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday morning. Those bellringers are also known as members of Best Buy's Geek Squad, who drive to the rescue of people trying to master the computers they bought from the store. This embracing holiday is just one of a handful of geeky observances: ""Darwin Day,"" ""Pi Day,"" ""Towel Day"" (think ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy""), ""Geek Pride Day."" There's even a ""Take Your Webmaster to Lunch Day."" But this particular day -- ""Embrace Your Geekness Day"" -- is copyrighted by Wellcat Holidays, and meant for people who are ""into dungeon games, comic books and doing vampire dress-up,"" as well as those who ""spend endless hours going strange places on the internet."" According to Wellcat Holidays, ""this is your day to roar!"" So why do Americans celebrate people who are defined by Webster's dictionary as, ""any person considered to be different from others in a negative or bizarre way, as a teenager seen as being socially or physically awkward""? According to Benjamin Nugent, author of ""American Nerd: The story of my people,"" a geek is ""a nerd who is defined by his knowledge on a certain subject."" (Nugent points out that this is a far cry from what the word ""geek"" used to mean -- a carnie who was so unskilled that all he or she could do was bite the heads off live animals.) Thanks to Silicon Valley and the charismatic representation of geekdom by people like Apple's Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak and Microsoft's Bill Gates, geeks are fashionable and associated with economic power, Nugent said. Even their interests, like video games and computer technology, ""have become so refined that they're irresistible to a huge percentage of the population,"" said Nugent. Genevieve Bell, a cultural anthropologist with Intel Labs, agrees. ""There are far more products, programs, services and applications than there's ever been before,"" she said. ""And they speak to a wider market than ever before."" Since geeks are strongly inclined to master technology, said Bell, they now represent dominance over a domain the general and less geeky members of the public would like to conquer. Geek holidays, while probably not necessary for true geeks to accept their quirks and interests, give others ample opportunity to celebrate and nurture their inner geek. Along with the mainstreaming of geek interests comes a bittersweet trade-off for geeks who had been marginalized in the past. Nugent said that when geeks and nerds were not as readily accepted in American culture, they had a thriving, fraternal community spirit. Now that technology, sci-fi, comics and gaming are mass consumer experiences, Nugent said, geek communities are fracturing. But in 2010, letting your geek flag fly has become a source of pride for many Americans. Bell said it's a natural fit for a country that's known as a nation of individuals. Scott Kauffman, CEO of Geeknet, the company that runs popular sites Slashdot.org, SourceForge.net and ThinkGeek.com, said that geeks will define the 2010s much as the GenXers defined the 1990s. Read Techland's interview: Hey, Wil Wheaton, what's the geekiest thing you've ever done? Kauffman likens geek obsession to the fan in everyone. ""People are getting in touch with their inner geekdom and that can take the form of many different kinds of passions or obsessions. It used to be a 'sports fan' or a 'sports nut,' now it's a geek,"" he said. Geek mainstreaming began decades ago, said Nugent, when ""Star Wars"" and the ""Lord of the Rings"" books burst on the scene to unprecedented popularity. Science fiction and fantasy, once the bastions of geek and nerd culture, became huge entertainment moneymakers thereafter, he said. ""More recently, our pop culture has become generous towards nerdy characters,"" said Nugent. Through TV shows like ""The OC"" and Judd Apatow's movies, geeks have become protagonists -- leading men, even -- and not just comic relief, he said. Bell goes so far as to say being geeky is downright American. ""Think about the railways or the electrification of America or the moon shot, even the Manhattan Project,"" she said. ""There's always a strong sense that to have technical prowess is a quintessential piece of what it is to be American ... and what it means to be successfully American."" The mainstreaming of geek interests naturally leads to another American pursuit: capitalism. Wellcat Holidays does, after all, make money on its copyrights. In the last year, Geeknet, a company that harnesses the natural talents of geeks and caters to their interests, saw an explosion of sales. Geeknet offers geeks a one-stop shop: geek-written content, free open source code and all the niche tchotchkes a geek could want. Companies appealing to a broader audience are ready to use images of geeks in order to see that same kind of success. Apple's PC and Mac commercials showcase two geeks -- old school and new -- while Intel's ""rock star"" commercials show off how geeky the company is (because their rock stars are inventors.) ""Communications technology, especially, has such a patina,"" said Bell, ""and geek culture puts a face on all this technology."" Geeks evoke the ideas of diversity and innovation, she said, and it's valuable for companies to commodify that. Nugent agrees. ""I think what those companies are exploiting is a desire for the reassurance of technical expertise,"" he said. ""This sort of cuddly nerd character who fixes your computer and makes everything right is reassuring,"" said Nugent. ""This isn't an intimidating expert who will say things you don't understand and condescend to you."" Best Buy's Geek Squad, for example, uses the image of geeks to appeal to a large audience. Kauffman said this kind of marketing says to customers, ""If you're not a geek and you want what geeks have, because geeks are cool and have cutting edge -- bleeding edge -- technology, we can bring that to you."" Nick Devita, a member of the bell-ringing Geek Squad team, thinks Best Buy has plenty of geek. ""We are a group of people ... that take the passion we have for technology and help other people embrace it, so they can have passion about it as well,"" he said. Ironically, geeks need little marketing and even less convincing. ""I think what's interesting about geek culture is that it doesn't need to be marketed to, much,"" said Nugent. ""If you have a new product, they will embrace it on its own merit, because they're geeks. They read the trade magazines, and they read articles in Wired and they obsess about these things in chat rooms. ""","The Geek Squad rang the NYSE bell Tuesday for ""Embrace Your Geekness Day""

"Washington (CNN) -- A missing Iranian researcher, who Tehran claimed the CIA abducted, has sought sanctuary in the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, a senior U.S. official and two senior Pakistani diplomatic sources told CNN on Tuesday. ""Iranian scientist Shahram Amiri, who was kidnapped by the Americans, had gone to the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C. and taken refuge at Iran's Interest Section. He has requested to be sent back to Iran quickly,"" Iran's semi-official news agency Mehr said Tuesday. Since he is an Iranian national, the Interest Section will prepare his papers, buy him a ticket and send him home, the Pakistani sources said. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that Amiri is in the United States ""of his own free will"" and is ""free to go"" back to Iran. She also repeated the U.S. request that Iran release three American hikers jailed there. Amiri told the United States of his plans to return to Iran, and he was scheduled to travel Monday but was unable to make the appropriate travel arrangements in time, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. Responding to a question about a potential ""prisoner swap,"" Crowley said the United States remains concerned about three American hikers being held against their will in Iran and Robert Levinson, the former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran two years ago. But he denied any suggestion of a swap. Last week, the United States returned 10 alleged spies to Russia in exchange for four people who had been jailed in Russia. Abdul Basit, a spokesman for the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Amiri came to the embassy at 6:30 p.m. Monday. The Pakistani diplomatic sources said no one in Iran was aware of Amiri's whereabouts until his arrival at the embassy. Because Iran and the United States do not maintain diplomatic ties, the Pakistani Embassy looks after Iran's interest in Washington. Iran's Interest Section is in a separate building on the grounds of the embassy. Basit said it is controlled and staffed by Iran -- with about 70 to 80 Iranian diplomats. Pakistan has no control over the section, Basit said, adding that Amiri was not a guest of, nor was he in the custody or protection of the Pakistani government. Amiri, a researcher at Tehran's Malek Ashtar University, mysteriously disappeared in June 2009 while on a religious pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, according to Iranian media reports. Iran has accused the United States of involvement in Amiri's disappearance, saying the researcher was taken to force him to give up data about Tehran's nuclear program. But the Pakistani sources said Amiri is not considered a top scientist in Iran and would not be privy to highly sensitive information, so his alleged captors apparently concluded he offered little use to them. The U.S. State Department has denied involvement but has been tight-lipped on whether Amiri defected and per policy, the CIA does not comment on defections. But a U.S. official who is not authorized to speak publicly said Amiri's actions show the reality of the situation. ""His multiple videos and now his trip to the Iranian Interests section -- clearly prove he was not held in the United States against his will,"" said the U.S. official. ""He came to this country freely, he lived here freely, and he has chosen freely to return to Iran. The United States, to be sure, isn't standing in his way. He himself gives the lie to the idea he was tortured or imprisoned. He can tell any story he wants -- but that won't make it true."" The U.S. official also said that Amiri ""may well be feeling some pressure from back home. ... That could be one explanation for his contradictory messages. That said, he's decided of his own volition to go back, and the U.S. won't stop him. He's been a free man here, and that includes the freedom to make his own choices."" On Sunday, Iranian media quoted a top Iranian lawmaker as saying that newly found documents back up Tehran's claims that the CIA is responsible. ""The U.S. move to kidnap Amiri runs counter to international regulations,"" said Javad Jahangirzadeh, a member of Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. He said Iranian officials had turned over the documents to the Swiss ambassador in Tehran. Last month, two videos surfaced on the internet of a man claiming to be Amiri in which he said he had escaped from U.S. agents and was hiding in Virginia. That was the third time that videos allegedly showing Amiri had circulated on the internet. In one, he said he had been kidnapped by U.S. agents. Another contradicted that claim and said he was living freely and studying in Arizona. In one of the videos posted June 30 on YouTube and dated June 14, the man again said that he was brought against his will to the United States and fears he will be discovered and re-arrested. ""I am Shahram Amiri, the son of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who with God's help succeeded in running away from the U.S. security agents in the state of Virginia. I am [temporarily] at a safe place and I am trying to do this video but it is quite possible that I may shortly be again arrested by American security agents."" He went on to say: ""I am not free here and not allowed to contact my family or other people. If I face any problems or if I do not return to my country soon, the government of the U.S. would be directly responsible for it."" CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos nor the identity of the man in them. ""If he is who people think he is, the U.S. would be in contact with the person,"" a CIA official said last month. And if he were being held against his will, ""how would he have been able to produce any of the videos?"" the official asked. In the second video that surfaced June 30 and dated June 23, the man claiming to be Amiri reassures his family about his well-being. ""I want to let my beloved family know that I am OK and they should not worry about my health,"" he says. ""With God's help I shall return to my beloved country in the next few days. I want them to be, as always, strong and patient and to pray for my safe return. I hope to see you in our beloved country."" Tehran blamed Washington for Amiri's disappearance shortly after revelations surfaced that Iran has been building a second uranium enrichment facility near the city of Qom. After that, tensions over Iran's nuclear program mounted. Iran says its nuclear energy is solely for civilian purposes. But the United States pushed the United Nations to punish Tehran for its nuclear ambitions. The Security Council recently slapped a fourth round of tough sanctions on the Islamic republic.

"(CNN) -- Michele Witte woke up about 1 a.m. on December 12, 1997, and went to change her son's diaper. Then she rocked him and laid her 10-month-old back in his crib. Later that morning, she went into his bedroom to wake him and found his lifeless body. She immediately fell to her knees screaming. Witte's son, Tyler, had gotten his neck stuck in a gap between the side rail and headboard created when a single screw had become loose. She called 911, but her baby boy was cold, and she knew in her heart he was already dead. As her 2-year-old daughter came bounding into the bedroom, she grabbed her so she wouldn't see her brother. Witte, an English teacher in Bellmore, New York, said the coroner ruled the death an accident, but she and her family notified the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Thirteen years later, the commission voted Wednesday in favor of new proposed mandatory standards for cribs. The new rules, likely to go into effect next year after a final vote by the federal commission, would render many cribs in the country as not up to code, regardless of whether the crib style and model was ever considered unsafe, and essentially would ban the manufacture and sale of drop-side cribs. In addition to eliminating drop-side cribs, the new rules will mandate better mattress support, sturdier hardware and better quality wood for crib construction. Between November 2007 and April of this year, there were 36 deaths associated with crib structural problems, according to Commission Chairwoman Inez Tenenbaum. Hazards in cribs include faulty hardware, dangerous gaps created from mattress support failures, and poor wood quality with crib slats that can be broken easily. The new standards aim to eliminate gaps where babies could become entrapped and suffocate, and to prevent babies from falling out of the crib. After Tyler's death, Witte, now 36, began to believe it was an isolated incident after a series of frustrating conversations and research. But in 2004, Witte heard about another couple whose baby had died in a drop-side crib just miles from her Bellmore home. She was outraged that the accidents continued to happen and ramped up her advocacy efforts. ""The coroner said it would take 15 seconds for him to asphyxiate,"" she said, her voice quivering with the memory of Tyler's death. ""My bedroom was close. I had the baby monitor on, but it's the silent killer. If you can't breathe, you can't scream out."" While Witte said she is happy about the latest developments, she is still worried about parents who have drop-side cribs. Since the accidents first started getting attention years ago, Witte said she's heard of some parents who let their babies sleep in beds with them, which the American Academy of Pediatrics discourages. Others have used duct tape or lodged their cribs against a wall. ""What does that mean for cribs already out there?"" she said. ""We need to have new safe cribs for people who can't afford it."" Witte's oldest daughter, now 14, slept in the oak crib with steel hardware that kiled her baby brother. Since then, Witte has had two more children, a girl, now 6, and a boy, 1. Both have slept in a new stationary crib with no movable parts. In fact Witte said the current crib will only come apart now with a sledgehammer. ""The problem is of hardware. Whenever you have something you are moving, the hardware is bound to fail,"" she said. When Witte puts her son down to sleep tonight, she will face the same stress she has dealt with for years. ""The safest places for a baby is safe, securely built, stationary crib,"" she said, adding that she has a video monitor in her son's room and gets up ""about 14 times a night checking on him."" ""I'm happy for the day when he's out and in the bed, and we're done with cribs.""","Michele Witte's 10-month-old son suffocated in a drop-side crib in 1997 .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- France's lower house of parliament Tuesday overwhelmingly passed a ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women. The vote was 335 to 1. The measure must still go to the French Senate before it becomes law.  The Senate is expected to vote on it in the week of September 20. Amnesty International immediately condemned the vote. ""A complete ban on the covering of the face would violate the rights to freedom of expression and religion of those women who wear the burqa or the niqab in public as an expression of their identity or beliefs,"" said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's expert on discrimination in Europe. French people back the ban by a margin of more than four to one, the Pew Global Attitudes Project found in a survey this spring. Some 82 percent of people polled approved of a ban, while 17 percent disapproved. That was the widest support the Washington-based think tank found in any of the five countries it surveyed. Clear majorities also backed burqa bans in Germany, Britain and Spain, while two out of three Americans opposed it, the survey found. The French Council of Ministers approved the measure in May, saying veils that cover the face ""cannot be tolerated in any public place."" Their approval sent the bill to parliament. The parliamentary vote is the latest step in France's efforts to ban the burqa, niqab and other Muslim garments that cover a woman's face. A panel of French lawmakers recommended a ban last year, and lawmakers unanimously passed a non-binding resolution in May calling the full-face veil contrary to the laws of the nation. ""Given the damage it produces on those rules which allow the life in community, ensure the dignity of the person and equality between sexes, this practice, even if it is voluntary, cannot be tolerated in any public place,"" the French government said when it sent the measure to parliament in May. The bill envisions a fine of 150 euros ($190) and/or a citizenship course as punishment for wearing a face-covering veil. Forcing a woman to wear a niqab or a burqa would be punishable by a year in prison or a 15,000-euro ($19,000) fine, the government said, calling it ""a new form of enslavement that the republic cannot accept on its soil."" The measure would take effect six months after passage, giving authorities time to try to persuade women who veil themselves voluntarily to stop. The French Council of State has warned that the ban could be incompatible with international human rights laws and the country's own constitution. The council advises on laws, but the government is not required to follow its recommendations. If the French bill is approved by the upper house and signed into law, it will be the first national ban in Europe on the burqa, a full-body covering that includes a mesh over the face, and the niqab, a full-face veil that leaves an opening only for the eyes. The hijab, which tightly covers the hair and neck but not the face, and the chador, which covers the body but not the face, apparently would not be banned by either law.  However, a 2004 law in France bans the wearing or displaying of overt religious symbols in schools -- including the wearing of headscarves by schoolgirls. The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life estimates that France has about 3.5 million Muslims, or about 6 percent of the population. France does not keep its own statistics on religious affiliation of the population, in keeping with its laws requiring the state to be strictly secular. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","NEW: Amnesty International condemns the vote, saying the ban violates religious freedom .

"(CNN) -- Andres Iniesta could miss Spain's opening game at the World Cup after suffering a thigh injury in a warm-up match. The Barcelona midfielder set up two goals for Spain in their emphatic 6-0 win over Poland in Murcia on Monday, but was substituted after just 39 minutes. Iniesta missed a large chunk of Barcelona's season with a thigh complaint, but team doctors insisted the injury was only minor. ""We substituted him because he had some discomfort in the back part of the thigh,"" Spain's team doctor Dr Oscar Celada was quoted as saying by the UK Press Association. ""He didn't notice any tear and it has not got any worse. It was at the start of the match and as he wasn't comfortable, we made the change - it's a minor muscle injury. ""We will calmly carry out tests on Wednesday, but we can initially rule out any muscle tear. It's a minor injury, but we have to take precautions,"" he added. Two of Spain's other injury doubts, Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas and Liverpool striker Fernando Torres, both came on a substitutes against Poland -- and scored -- as they look to step up their fitness. It was Torres' first action since playing for Liverpool against Portuguese side Benfica back in April. ""It was almost two months without playing since the Benfica game and I was really keen to come back,"" he said after the match. ""They have let me play for a while today and it was great to go out there and score."" As for Iniesta, it remains to be seen whether he will play any part in Spain's opening Group H game against Switzerland on June 16.","Andres Iniesta is a doubt for Spain's opening match of the World Cup .

"LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- The tears begin and her voice trembles as Ruth Martinez remembers the first few days of her new world. CNN's John King talks to Ruth Martinez and her son Jacob. She would leave work, pick up her son Jacob at school and drive aimlessly, sometimes sneaking back to the office, ""to watch TV there without my boss knowing."" Her husband had lost his job, and the stress drove them apart. Then Martinez was evicted. Suddenly, her car was her home. And she was afraid to ask for help. ""We just prayed,"" Martinez told us. ""And I was embarrassed because a Hispanic Latina does not ask for help. The way I was raised, you put your pride to the side and did what you had to do."" Rudy Salinas finds them in cars, under bridges, in abandoned homes, and even in protected trenches artfully dug by the military veterans who put survival skills learned in Iraq and Afghanistan to use in America's inner cities. Salinas has been working to help the homeless here for eight years now, driving the streets every day looking for people hiding under bridges and in abandoned properties. More and more of late, there are people in business clothes, heading off to work. More and more, they are women with young children. ""In my eight years of doing this I have never come across as many people who've told us they have never been homeless before,"" said Salinas, the director of community outreach for People Assisting the Homeless. ""It's quite different from what I have seen in the past."" Estimates of the problem vary widely. A 2007 survey by the Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority estimated there were more than 73,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County. Activists like Salinas who walk the streets say the number has grown in the past year as the recession has deepened, and that more and more they encounter families. The ingredients for this growing problem are a troubling mix: double-digit employment, in the 20 percent or higher range in poorer African-American and Latino communities, high foreclosure rates and budget cuts to social service programs including homeless assistance. ""A lot of folks who just recently lost their job, and a few folks that were telling us they were living and paying the rent -- following everything they had to do -- but the owner of the property was foreclosed and they had to be moved out,"" Salinas said. ""So we've seen a combination and it's pretty much balanced between the two right now. But we're seeing more now than I have seen in the past eight years."" Martinez is one of the new faces among the homeless. The government told her it couldn't help because she had a job and didn't qualify. Finally, LAHSA, a homeless advocacy group, offered a voucher for a hotel. It was, in Martinez's words, ""very, very low class."" Her purse was stolen. Then her car. Drug dealers roamed the grounds. But it was a roof over Jacob's head. ""I was willing to deal with it because I had nowhere else to go."" The agency that gave her the voucher then referred her to People Assisting the Homeless and before too long Martinez and Jacob were assigned a room at a Los Angeles shelter. It is cramped; bunk beds against the wall and a thin mattress on the floor where Jacob prefers to sleep. No chairs. No windows. No TV. No complaints. ""PATH is an awesome place,"" Martinez tells us after giving us a tour of the shelter, which has a common kitchen area and family room with a single TV, and a small outdoor play area for the children. Families are in one section, single women another across the hall. Men are sheltered upstairs. She has been here six weeks and can stay six months. Those given rooms must agree to set aside some of their earnings in a savings account to help build enough money to rent an apartment, and there are strict curfews and rules of conduct. Martinez still goes to work every day. She still picks up her son at school, and makes sure he keeps his grades up. It wouldn't dawn on any passerby outside that she is homeless -- and she sees a powerful lesson in that. ""The person next to you at times could be homeless and little do you know that they are. So when people see homeless, I wish society would try to help ... I wish society would be more gentle with words sometimes."" Across town, in a motel whose better days were long ago, Dina Acevedo huddles on one of two twin beds lined against the walls. Her three daughters sit closely at her side, though the youngest, 3-year-old Citially, from time to time gets up to wander the small room or play with a small stuffed Dalmatian. ""I am homeless because we cannot afford an apartment,"" Acevedo says. ""Renting is very expensive here."" She is divorcing a husband she said was abusive. After taking off, he is now paying some child support because of the efforts of the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office. The girls were born in the United States and are citizens, but Dina cannot work because she is here illegally, applying now for legal status after being told a nonprofit she believed was helping her for years had lost her paperwork. At times in the past, she has worked in the underground economy, cleaning homes and doing other odd jobs. But a back injury makes that work more difficult, and she says there are fewer jobs because of the economy and more and more prospective employers who demand to see immigration documents. ""They request all the time for papers to work,"" she said. ""I have been waiting for my immigration papers since 2000,"" she said. She could afford a small studio or one-bedroom, but no one will rent such a small place to a family of four, so she lives in a tiny motel room. Her church is part of her lifeline. ""They support us spiritually and with pantries for food,"" Acevedo said. ""The church is like our second home and we are so happy there."" In June it will be one year in these cramped quarters. To cook, the family goes down the hall to a shared kitchen. There is just one bathroom for the four of them. To bathe or shower, there is an additional, though welcome, complication: two tiny turtles, who spend most of their day wandering the bathtub. Acevedo said she will stay here until her immigration status is resolved, and then plans to move to Louisiana where she has friends and relatives, and where she said there are more jobs and a lower cost of living. For Martinez, Los Angeles is home, and she hopes by the end of her six months in the People Assisting the Homeless shelter to have set aside enough money to get an apartment. Still, as urgent as her need to save, she often gives a few dollars away on the ride back to the shelter at night. ""When I get off the freeway I see a gentleman there all the time,"" she said. ""If I have a couple of dollars I give it to him. Even though I am homeless, I would rather give the last dollar I have to the person who I see needs it more than me.""","Ruth Martinez worked in an office, but lived in her car .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- The ""barefoot bandit,"" teenager Colton Harris-Moore, was taken Tuesday from the Bahamas to Miami to face charges, the FBI said. Special Agent Judith Orihuela said he landed at 6:23 p.m. aboard an American Eagle flight on which the FBI was aboard, and will appear Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. in federal court in Miami. The 19-year-old's arrival occurred a few hours after he pleaded guilty in a Bahamian court to a charge of illegally landing a plane, paid a $300 fine and was ordered deported, his lawyer said. A federal law enforcement official said the $300 came from a program for U.S. citizens abroad who are strapped for cash. Harris-Moore's lawyer, Monique Gomez, said her fee was being paid not by her client but by ""an anonymous donor."" ""He seems to be very remorseful,"" the lawyer told CNN in a telephone interview from Nassau about her client, who attended the court hearing wearing white sneakers, shorts and a T-shirt bearing the word ""Bahamas."" Harris-Moore was taken into custody on Harbour Island in the Bahamas early Sunday. He is sought in a string of home and airport break-ins in various U.S. locations along with thefts of vehicles. Asked whether he acknowledges guilt in the other cases, his lawyer said, ""Let me put it this way -- he wishes he had done things a little differently in his life."" Still, she added, he appeared ""in good spirits."" Authorities in Madison County, Nebraska, issued an arrest warrant for Harris-Moore last month on charges of burglary and theft by unlawful taking or deception. The affidavit supporting the warrant alleges the youth waged a crime spree. He faces charges in Washington state in the theft of an aircraft, and police have said they believe he stole a Cessna in Indiana and flew it to the Bahamas, where it was found in the shallows off Abaco Island. The teen had been on the run since he escaped from a juvenile halfway house in Renton, Washington, in 2008. The FBI had offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Typically in extradition cases, the accused makes a first appearance in the federal court closest to where he was arrested, said Emily Langlie, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Western District of Washington. The Southern District of Florida, in Miami, is the closest jurisdiction to the Bahamas, said Langlie. In his initial U.S. appearance, he will be told of his rights and read an initial charge of interstate transportation of stolen property, Langlie said. The complaint, which was sealed until last week, was filed last December and stems from his allegedly stealing a plane in Bonner's Ferry, Idaho, and crashing it outside Granite Falls, Washington, she said. U.S. marshals will then take him to the Western District of Washington in Seattle. Under the federal system, the case will then go to a grand jury. If an indictment is returned, more charges could be filed. The federal charge of interstate transportation of stolen goods carries a penalty of up to 10 years. Federal prosecutors are working with other states to determine the best way to go forward in this case, but the Washington courts will get him first since he was arrested on their warrant, she said. Harris-Moore is called the ""barefoot bandit"" because he was without shoes when he allegedly broke into houses. He also was barefoot when apprehended in the Bahamas at the Romora Bay Resort and Marina by police responding to a reported sighting Sunday. The youth has amassed more than 80,000 Facebook fans. In December, Time magazine dubbed him ""America's Most Wanted Teenage Bandit."" Also, 20th Century Fox has purchased the rights for a film based on his exploits. Romora Bay officials said in a statement Harris-Moore arrived on Harbour Island from the nearby island of Eleuthera in a 15-foot skiff. The marina's security director, Kenneth Strachan, reported seeing him running down the dock about 2 a.m. Sunday, carrying a gun. The young man told him, ""They're going to kill me,"" Strachan reported. He put out a call for help. Guards disabled the skiff's engine, but the young man attempted to steal a second boat, according to resort manager Anne Ward. However, he ran aground in the shallow water. Authorities surrounded him and shot out the boat's engines, Ward said. ""At one point, the boy threw his computer in the water and put a gun to his head,"" she said in the statement. ""He was going to kill himself. Police talked him out of it."" Authorities loaded him into a resort work truck and took him to a police station, the statement said. Police said a gun and other items were seized from him.

"(CNN) -- Celebrity chef Kathy Casey predicts two flavor trends in cocktails for 2010 will be fresh ginger and hibiscus. Casey is known around the world for her expertise in mixing food and drinks. Her company, Kathy Casey Food Studios®-Liquid Kitchen, has been consulting with a new nightclub at the Fairmont Abu Dhabi about its food and beverage menu. While creating bubbly drinks in the Middle East, Casey substitutes sparkling date cider for apple cider. This mixologist, who knows how to stir up liquid fun, shares these two recipes from her latest book, ""Sips & Apps."" Green-Eye Daiquiri . This special holiday variation of my Green-Eye Daiquiri gets a flavor boost from quickly flamed fresh thyme, which releases the herbal aromatics and adds a little holiday theatrics! The recipe makes one drink. The ""flaming agent"" is green Chartreuse. With its extracts of 130 plants, it adds a sophisticated and unusual flavor. Please use caution and good judgment when crafting any flaming drink. 2 sprigs fresh thyme . 1/8 ounce green Chartreuse . 3/4 ounce simple syrup * (see recipe) 3/4 ounce fresh lime juice . 1 1/2 - 2 ounces white rum . Garnish: fresh thyme sprig . Bend the thyme sprigs and curl into the bottom of a heavy heat-proof double old-fashioned glass. Drizzle or ""spritz"" the thyme with the green Chartreuse. Carefully using a long match or lighter, ignite the green chartreuse. Let it flame just for a few seconds until thyme gets a tiny singe on it. Be careful glass does not get too hot -- have something available to smother the fire if it gets too big. Then quickly add the simple syrup to extinguish the flames. It is important to make it in this order as the simple syrup will put out the flames. Then measure in the lime juice and rum. Fill the glass with ice and stir well. Garnish with a thyme sprig. *Simple Syrup: Bring 1 cup water and 1 cup sugar to a boil. Immediately remove from heat. Cool. Store refrigerated for up to two weeks.

"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- For years, Kathy Broussard flew her single-engine Piper Cherokee across Texas, bringing critically ill patients to Houston for life-saving medical treatments. ""I would pick up patients and drop them off ... and they would call a cab, and that was how it was done,"" said Broussard, who was part of a group of volunteer pilots who flew in patients from all over Texas. In 1999, one of her frequent-flyer patients, Eva, called Broussard and said she wouldn't be coming in. ""She started crying and says, 'Kathy, I don't have cab fare.' "" Houston, Texas, is home to many medical centers, including MD Anderson Cancer Center, one of the world's premier cancer treatment facilities. But cab fare from Houston's main airports to the treatment centers can range from $50 to more than $100 each way. For patients struggling financially, that expense alone can keep them from getting the treatments they need to stay alive. ""People lose everything. They lose their cars; they lose their homes. They're living with relatives. They wouldn't have cab fare. A lot of people would just stay home and die,"" said Broussard, 60. ""And that's just not acceptable."" So Broussard started a group she called Houston Ground Angels, organizing volunteers to drive patients to and from Houston's airports and treatment centers for free. Today, driving her red pickup along Texas highways, Broussard credits Eva -- who passed away in 2001 from colon cancer -- as the inspiration for the program. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . ""I said, 'Eva, I'll drive you down.' I put her in my truck and went downtown. And then, all of the sudden, it just popped in my head, 'I wonder if [other people in] Houston would be interested in this?' "" Broussard placed an ad in the Houston Chronicle calling for volunteer drivers, and the response was overwhelming. About 300 people called to sign up. At the time, Broussard was a single mother of five working full-time at an oil refinery. She spent her spare time coordinating the drivers, or ""ground angels."" When pilots alerted Broussard that they were flying in a patient, she would arrange for a ground angel to meet them. ""I was on the phone all the time. I carried a spiral notebook with all the volunteers' names and numbers in it,"" Broussard said. Ultimately, the pilots liked the program so much that they asked to join, and the organization became the Houston Ground Angels and Pilots. Today, the group includes nearly 50 pilots and 300 drivers. Patients contact the organization to request ground transportation from a Houston airport or a flight from their regional airport. Requests are posted on the group's website, and volunteers sign up for each ""mission."" Missions take place seven days a week. Rides are provided to patients who arrive into the Houston area on a commercial flight or who've been flown in to a regional airport by one of the program's pilots. The group also helps fly in patients from the Gulf Coast, Oklahoma and Arkansas by working with other volunteer flying organizations whose pilots cover part of the distance. Since 2001, the group has completed about 6,000 missions -- most of them rides, along with hundreds of flights. Broussard says many volunteers are drawn to the group because they have lost loved ones to cancer. Cathy Laflen, 62, has been relying on the group for eight years. After she was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2001, the cost of treatment crippled her financially. Unable to work, she lost her home and her car. Laflen, who lives about 4½ hours from Houston by car, was referred to MD Anderson Cancer Center but lacked the funds or transportation to get there. With the help of Broussard's team, Laflen has been able to fly into Houston and get treated. She credits the volunteers with giving her hope. ""They've saved my life,"" Laflen said. ""Anytime that I need to come up here, they do it. The ground angels have everything set up. I don't have to worry. I would have died a long time ago, because they have nothing like this down where I live."" Patients receiving transportation from Broussard's group must submit proof of their medical need. Those requesting flights also must have a letter from their doctor saying that they need air transport and that they are well enough for it. Recently retired, Broussard is now a full-time volunteer. She and her team aim to make sure that patients coming into town for treatment travel without stress. ""There's no worry, because there is going to be somebody that's going to fly them,"" she said. ""There will be somebody that will pick them up. They're not thrown to the wolves in the big Houston metropolis, of being afraid of where to go."" Broussard -- who has also opened her house to patients who can't afford a place to stay -- said the program hits home the most when she sees patients thriving despite being told they had a limited life expectancy. ""They tell us all the time that they get their strength through us,"" she said. ""If they only knew it's the other way around."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Shahram Amiri -- a nuclear scientist Tehran claimed was kidnapped by U.S. agents -- told a state-run television station in Iran that he was abducted by U.S. intelligence officials and faced ""psychological warfare and pressure that are much worse than being in prison."" State-run Press TV said Wednesday that Amiri spoke in an interview after his escape, telling the channel, ""I think I will be unable to get into details during this limited period of time and I will postpone it to when I am hopefully in my dear country Iran, so I can speak to the media and my own people with ease of mind and tell them about my ordeal over the past 14 months."" Amiri has left the United States and is headed back to Iran, the country's state-run media said Wednesday morning. ""Following the Islamic Republic's efforts and with the effective cooperation of the embassy of Pakistan in Washington ... Shahram Amiri left the United States and will arrive in Tehran via a third country,"" the news agency, IRNA, reported -- quoting a foreign ministry spokesman. Amiri, who is a researcher from Tehran's Malek Ashtar University, mysteriously disappeared in June 2009 while on a religious pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, according to Iranian media reports. On Monday, Amiri went to Iran's Interest Section at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington and asked to be sent home. The Iranian government has accused the United States of involvement in Amiri's disappearance, with Iran saying the researcher was taken to force him to give up data about Tehran's nuclear program. In the Press TV interview, Amiri said he was kidnapped in Medina, Saudi Arabia, by three men in a van. ""Once I got into the van, the man who was inside said to me, 'Don't make any noise.' I was confused at the moment and had no idea what was happening,"" Amiri said Wednesday. According to Amiri, he was later drugged and transported to the United States in a plane. ""I was under very special circumstances for 14 months in the United States. I was not completely free, nor was I like a prisoner, that is, in shackles as viewers might think,"" Amiri added. ""I was in a completely unique situation which is very difficult to describe."" Press TV reported that Amiri was offered $10 million in bribes to cooperate with the United States. A top Iranian lawmaker recently claimed that newly found documents back up Tehran's claims that the CIA is responsible for Amiri's disappearance, Iranian media reported Sunday. Javad Jahangirzadeh, a member of Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, said Iranian officials had turned over the documents to the Swiss ambassador in Tehran. The U.S. State Department has denied that charge. A U.S. official, who is not authorized to talk to the media about such issues, told CNN last month that it would be ""ludicrous, absurd and even preposterous"" to claim an individual was kidnapped by the United States and held against his will. Last month, two videos surfaced on the Internet of a man claiming to Amiri, in which he said he had escaped from U.S. agents and was hiding in Virginia. That was the third time that videos allegedly showing Amiri had been circulated on the Internet. In one, he said he had been kidnapped by U.S. agents. Another contradicted that claim and said he was living freely and studying in Arizona. In one of the videos posted June 30 on YouTube and dated June 14, the man again said that he was brought against his will to the United States and fears he will be discovered and re-arrested. ""I am Shahram Amiri, the son of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who with God's help succeeded in running away from the U.S. security agents in the state of Virginia. I am [temporarily] at a safe place and I am trying to do this video but it is quite possible that I may shortly be again arrested by American security agents."" He went on to say: ""I am not free here and not allowed to contact my family or other people. If I face any problems or if I do not return to my country soon, the government of the U.S. would be directly responsible for it."" CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos, nor the identity of the man in them. ""If he is who people think he is, the U.S. would be in contact with the person,"" a CIA official said last month. And if he were being held against his will, ""how would he have been able to produce any of the videos?"" the official said. In the second video that surfaced June 30 and dated June 23, the man claiming to be Amiri reassures his family about his well-being. ""I want to let my beloved family know that I am OK and they should not worry about my health,"" he says. ""With God's help I shall return to my beloved country in the next few days. I want them to be, as always, strong and patient and to pray for my safe return. I hope to see you in our beloved country."" Tehran blamed Washington for Amiri's disappearance shortly after revelations surfaced that Iran has been building a second uranium enrichment facility near the city of Qom. After that, tensions over Iran's nuclear program mounted. Iran claims its nuclear energy is solely for civilian purposes. But the United States has pushed the United Nations to punish Tehran for its nuclear ambitions. The Security Council recently slapped a fourth round of tough sanctions on the Islamic republic. It is unclear how much information Amiri was privy to in Iran. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","The Iranian scientist is en route to his homeland .

"(CNN) -- Editor's note: Amy Gahran writes about mobile tech for CNN.com. She is a San Francisco Bay Area writer and media consultant whose blog, contentious.com, explores how people communicate in the online age. As AT&T and other wireless providers move away from offering unlimited data plans, many smartphone owners want to better understand their own wireless data usage to avoid racking up surprise charges. While you can log on to your wireless carrier account to check how much data you've used so far during the current billing period, you often can't tell how much data each type of mobile activity consumes. Recently in Fierce Broadband Wireless, Cintia Garza of Maravedis (a wireless market research and analysis firm) offered a table of smartphone data usage by mobile activity. She estimates that if you generally send or receive 20 e-mails on your smartphone daily (no attachments), that's probably about 0.01 GB of data usage over the course of one month. Bumping that up to about 70 no-attachment e-mails sent or received daily uses about 0.04 GB per month. Viewing an average of 20 web pages on your smartphone per a day would consume about 0.11 GB in a month, according to Garza. Watching 20 minutes of mobile video per day uses about 1.14 GB per month. An hour of streaming mobile music per day uses about 0.86 GB per month. Garza's benchmarks can help you plan a mobile ""diet"" that won't bust your budget. She based these estimates on data from AT&T smartphone users, and not all smartphones and carrier networks are created equally. But it helps to know which mobile activities generally are more data-heavy, so you know what to cut back on to keep your wireless bill under control. What's a ""normal"" level of mobile data usage? According to Garza, an average residential (non-business) smartphone user consumes about this much data per day: . • Fewer than 10 e-mails sent/received (no attachments) = 2.5 MB . • 1 e-mail with photo attachment = 10 MB . • 3 e-mails sent/received (with other attachment) = 12 MB . • 5 minutes of streaming music per day (about 2.5 hours per month) = 72 MB . • 5 web pages visited = 25 MB . • 0-1 applications downloaded (games/songs) = 60 MB . • 10 social media posts per day = 14 MB . • 1 minute of streaming video per day (about 30 minutes per month) = 60 MB . Over the course of a month, that adds up to 255.5 MB (about a quarter of a gigabyte) on average -- but that's just for mobile content. Mobile access to data also entails considerable overhead, and consumers pay for that, too. The smallest of AT&T's new data plans gives mobile users 200 MB of data per month for $15. The ""DataPro"" plan gives people 2 gigabytes of data -- about 10 times more -- for $25 per month. ""Signaling traffic"" is how smartphones keep in touch with wireless data networks and move between cells. Garza explains that the growing problem of wireless network congestion comes mostly from smartphones constantly querying the network as they move among cell sites. This means that you're racking up some data usage anytime your smartphone is on. According to Garza, ""While data traffic is also growing, signaling traffic is outpacing actual mobile data traffic by 30 percent to 50 percent, if not more."" There's not much that consumers can do to control the amount of signaling traffic from their smartphones -- aside from simply turning your phone off or operating it in ""airplane mode"" when you don't need online access or incoming calls. However, mobile content usage is something that you can control.","One expert's benchmarks can help you plan a mobile ""diet"" that won't bust your budget .

"(InStyle.com) -- From the humanitarian crisis in Darfur to art therapy and literacy programs, find out about the favorite charitable organizations and causes of some of Hollywood's biggest names. ""There is more hope and love on the cancer floor of the hospital than anywhere else in life,"" says Eva Longoria. Intensive care . When Eva Longoria visited Annie Martinez, their to-do list was simple: playing, reading books and talking. ""I told her to come live with me,"" says Annie, 6, who spent last year at Children's Hospital Los Angeles undergoing leukemia treatments that made her lose weight and her curls. Annie now returns monthly for ""pokies"" -- 6-year-old-speak for chemotherapy -- but she is considered lucky. She survived. ""There are reasons our children are dying at a faster rate,"" says Longoria, 32, who notes that Latino children have a significantly higher cancer-mortality rate owing to factors like delayed diagnosis and the language barrier. To combat those odds, the Desperate Housewives actress teamed up with Padres Contra El Cáncer (Parents Against Cancer), an L.A.-based organization that works with area hospitals to provide counseling, support and information for children with cancer. It assists about 750 families each year. Since stepping up as national spokeswoman in 2005, Longoria has helped raise funds for children like Annie and their loved ones. ""It is too difficult,"" admits Annie's mother, Elizabeth, who turned to Padres for assistance. Longoria has already recruited celebrity friends, including Mario Lopez, Wilmer Valderrama and her husband, Tony Parker, to bolster her efforts. Her next goal is to help the organization go national and hire hospital interpreters. Until then, she'll continue her visits, bringing along toys, chocolates and the message that there is someone to listen -- in English or in Spanish. ""I am there to hear their story, to comfort them,"" says Longoria, ""to let them know that they are remembered and important."" Hearts and crafts . A worn homemade Playbill hangs on the wall of the All Saints Health Care hospital room that David Anguiano, 17, shares with his pet turtle and another patient. On the announcement Anguiano's name is more prominent than that of his famous collaborator, Kirsten Dunst, and a fan letter from the actress hangs nearby. ""My dear David,"" it reads, ""I will always love you. Marry me, please (or at least consider it!). All my love. Your girl, Kirsten XOXO."" ""He's a witty little flirt,"" says a laughing Dunst, who met Anguiano last year during her first hospital visit for the Art of Elysium, an L.A. charity that pairs artists with young people battling serious medical conditions, like cancer and AIDS. The actress regularly does artistic projects with kids in the program, some of whom are limited by conditions requiring ventilators or tracheotomies. ""A lot of the kids can't communicate, but it's amazing how much they say to you with their eyes,"" says Dunst. ""Their faces light up when they hear music or see dancing."" The Art of Elysium offers many projects, from sculpture to jewelry making and sand art, to foster creativity in patients, no matter what their challenges. ""We bring the paint to their beds and finger-paint,"" says Dunst, who helps by opening their fingers and guiding them on the page. ""It is great for them to feel the paint on their hands,"" she says. ""It's all sensorial."" Last year she worked with more than 20 children to create a mural-size painting from overlapping handprints, which was then auctioned off at a fund-raiser. Dunst, who plans to contribute her own paintings to help raise money, has seen the group gain momentum during her weekly hospital visits. In 2005 the charity worked with 5,000 children; last year it was 25,000. ""It's nice to be there to watch it grow,"" says Dunst, ""and to grow with it."" Hope for Darfur . When Don Cheadle packed his bags for a January 2005 trip to Darfur, Sudan, where government-sponsored militia have killed 400,000 and displaced 2.5 million people, the last thing on his mind was personal safety. ""I wasn't nervous about going,"" says Cheadle, 42. ""I was nervous about what I would see."" What he observed has stayed with him to this day. The villages he visited were deserted after attacks by the Janjaweed militia (whose tactics include fire, rape, murder and starvation); the shelters at refugee camps in neighboring Chad turned out to be little more than temporary tarps. ""People are living in dust, surrounded on all sides by terror,"" says Cheadle. He did his best to connect with the children in Darfur --like juggling rocks to encourage them to play -- but ""the kids were drawing pictures depicting bombers,"" he says. ""It was heartbreaking because you could see their future, and it was bleak."" He saw similar circumstances six months later, when he visited war-torn Uganda, where more than 30,000 children have been abducted and forced into a rebel army. ""My daughter listened to a 12-year-old talk about having to kill his best friend,"" says the actor, who visited shelters where children sleep for protection. ""It opened my eyes. What hope do people in Darfur have? What hope do people in Uganda have?"" Cheadle believes things will get better only when the international community demands change from elected officials. John Prendergast, senior adviser of the International Crisis Group, who traveled with Cheadle, says, ""Nothing is as powerful as citizens writing letters saying, 'This issue matters. If you don't do anything, I'm going to take that into consideration when I cast my vote.'"" Until then the only assistance comes in the form of rescue workers. ""But they are down there with only courage and conviction,"" says Cheadle. ""And that doesn't stop bullets."" For more information go to Save Darfur Coalition. By the book . ""Who wants to hear a story?"" Joan Allen asks a scrum of eager tykes all under the age of 5 as she plops down with them on the floor to read a classic tale. ""Then came the big Billy Goat Gruff. 'Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap' went the bridge, and the bridge creaked and groaned under him,"" she reads in a low, ominous voice. ""Who's that tramping over my bridge?"" Allen demands loudly, now sounding decidedly troll-like, as her listeners at Round-the-Clock Nursery, a Manhattan preschool, giggle and lean in closer. Several stories later, at the end of the reading hour, each child will go home with a new book of his or her own, courtesy of First Book, an organization that provides disadvantaged children with books. Allen, who has been a spokeswoman for them for the last five years, ""is someone who understands how powerful books can be for a child,"" says the group's president, Kyle Zimmer. Allen became involved with First Book through her friendship with a children's book publisher. In addition to raising awareness of the group's work, she frequently visits schools to read to the students and willingly participates in First Book fund-raisers. But, says Zimmer, her commitment goes beyond using her celebrity to help the cause. ""She has even been to our dirty, dusty warehouse, carting out books and loading them into the trunks of people's cars."" For Allen, it's simply part of fulfilling the group's mission: getting books into the hands of children. ""These kids are in a situation where they always get secondhand things, but here they get new books to bring home and share,"" she said. ""It's an esteem-building thing."" Which certainly has been constructive. With the help of supporters like Allen, the organization has just given away its 50 millionth book, and that speaks volumes. A world of hope . When Lucy Liu visited the African nation of Lesotho in 2005, the Unicef ambassador left her mark on the landscape. ""I planted a peach tree there,"" says the actress. ""The fruit is supposed to bring good luck and blessings."" In truth, blessings are in short supply in many of the regions she has visited through Unicef, which offers global health and educational support for children. Taking inspiration from past ambassadors like Audrey Hepburn, Liu offered her services three years ago. Since then she has been on call for humanitarian trips to places in Africa and Asia and has made a habit of keeping her passport with her and her immunizations up-to-date. Last year she visited Balakot, Pakistan, after an earthquake left more than 70,000 dead. She arrived to find rubble and camps with ""13 people sleeping in one very small tent,"" says Liu, who helped distribute warm clothes. ""The line kept going on for miles; people were desperately trying to get shoes and socks for their young ones."" More disturbing was the makeshift outdoor ""school"" next to a mass grave for children who had died in the quake. ""Everyone was sitting in a circle on the dirt for the class,"" says Liu. ""There was a grave a foot away."" The message was clear to her: Life continues. Another unforgettable moment came when a student in a Lesotho school offered up her tight little fist. ""She opened it, and there was a nub of a pencil that she was holding on to for dear life,"" recalls Liu. ""It's amazing how much they want to be educated."" Schooling is just one step for the organization, which uses even the smallest donations to address needs like immunizations and basic health care that help to save more than two million children each year. ""Contribute 50 cents, a dollar or 10 cents,"" says Liu. ""It all adds up, and we know exactly where every penny is going."" For more information go to UNICEF.

"(CNN) -- Police were watching for any further violence Wednesday after a third night of rioting in Belfast, Northern Ireland, that left one officer hurt, officials said. About 150 nationalist youths fired shots and threw petrol bombs and a pipe bomb at officers. They also shone high-powered laser pens into officers' eyes. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said it was now investigating and hoping to identify those involved in Tuesday night's violence. Burning barricades were set up in the Ardoyne area of the city, which has been a flashpoint of the recent violence. One vehicle was hijacked and set on fire, police said. Police used water cannons to disperse the rioters and the violence was over by 2 a.m. (9 p.m. ET Tuesday), police said. One officer was hurt, but not seriously, police said. Earlier there were reports that several had been injured. Trouble also flared in other parts of Belfast. The latest violence began after a decision to allow a Protestant parade to pass through a mainly Catholic neighborhood on July 12, a day when Protestants march to celebrate the victory of England's King William III over his ousted Catholic predecessor, James II, in 1689. Known as The Twelfth, the holiday has previously been marred by violence and has been a source of tension between Catholics and Protestants for years. Police had to remove demonstrators who staged a sit-down protest to block this year's march. Rioting erupted a short time later and more than 50 officers were hurt. The previous night, 27 officers were hurt, including three who were shot at close range by a masked man armed with a shotgun. Speaking at the House of Commons on Wednesday, British Prime Minister David Cameron condemned the ""completely unacceptable behavior"" of the protesters and praised the police as ""brave"" and ""restrained."" ""Over 80 police officers have been injured after being attacked, including by petrol bombs, pipe bombs, and bricks,"" Cameron said. ""The police came under fire on Sunday night, and shots were again fired last night. The police have been forced to retaliate with baton rounds and with water cannons."" Cameron said Northern Ireland's police force is under local control, no longer governed by London, so ""there is no excuse for anyone not to cooperate with that police force."" Journalist Peter Taggart in Belfast, Northern Ireland, contributed to this report.","NEW: One officer was hurt in a third night of violence in Belfast .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration aims to cut the annual number of new HIV infections in the United States by 25 percent over the next five years, according to a nationwide HIV/AIDS strategy unveiled Tuesday. Federal officials are also seeking to combat a growing sense of complacency about the disease, partly by reducing the percentage of infected Americans who are unaware of their status. Specifically, the strategy focuses on three key areas: reducing the number of people who become infected, increasing access to care, and decreasing HIV-related health disparities. ""The actions we take now will build upon a legacy of global leadership, national commitment, and sustained efforts on the part of Americans from all parts of the country and all walks of life to end the HIV epidemic in the United States and around the world,"" President Barack Obama said in a memorandum sent to a number of federal departments and agencies. ""The question is not whether we know what to do, but whether we will do it,"" the president said Tuesday evening at a White House reception. ""Whether we will fulfill those obligations .... to prevent a tragedy."" The White House's goal, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius noted, is to make new infections rare while ensuring that those who are infected have an ""unfettered access to high quality life-extending care free from stigma and discrimination."" Among other things, the strategy calls for an intensification of HIV prevention efforts among communities where the disease is most heavily concentrated. It highlights the need to steer federal grant money toward organizations dealing with high-risk groups such as gay and bisexual men and illegal substance users. It also cites the importance of greater education and ""scientifically proven biomedical and behavioral approaches"" to reduce the spread of the disease, including the use of condoms, abstinence, HIV testing, and access to sterile needles and syringes. While the spread of the disease has slowed since the 1980s, an estimated 56,000 Americans still contract HIV each year, according to White House Domestic Policy Council Director Melody Barnes. Roughly 1.1 million Americans are currently living with HIV. Approximately 1 in 5 infected Americans is unaware of his or her status, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The plan does not call for a major increase in the roughly $19 billion the federal government spends on HIV/AIDS programs, though administration officials on Tuesday cited new benefits provided by the recently passed health care reform law. One leading HIV/AIDS activist, however, was sharply critical of the administration's strategy. Michael Weinstein, president of the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, told CNN in an interview that ""when you see what this administration has done on AIDS, you have to give them very low grades."" Obama has ""consistently underfunded AIDS"" programs, Weinstein said. The president ""did not mention the word AIDS for the first five months of his administration. This national AIDS strategy has been worked on for 15 months, [and] I think it could have been done in 15 minutes. There's nothing new in it."" Weinstein criticized the administration's intention to redirect money to those groups at greatest risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. ""It's not good to pit one group against another and it's unnecessary,"" he said. ""The bottom line is that we should be seeking to get all sexually active people to get an HIV test."" The White House announcement came less than a week after a group of scientists published a study saying they had made a key discovery that could help in the development of an HIV vaccine. Scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said last week that they had found three human antibodies that neutralize more than 90 percent of the current circulating HIV-1 strains. ""This is significant because we've now found antibodies that are good templates for HIV vaccine development,"" said Peter Kwong, co-author of the study published last Thursday in the journal Science. More than 18,000 people with AIDS die each year in the United States, according to the CDC. More than 576,000 people with AIDS have died in the United States since the epidemic began. The World Health Organization says AIDS accounted for an estimated 2 million deaths in 2008, and more than 33 million people are living with HIV worldwide. CNN's Alan Silverleib and Dick Uliano contributed to this report .","A leading AIDS activist criticizes the White House for underfunding HIV/AIDS efforts .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India successfully launched five satellites into orbit Monday, one of them a mini-spacecraft built by students, space officials said. The main payload was a remote-sensing satellite -- CARTOSAT-2B -- which the country's space agency said would be used in infrastructure programs because of its capability to take high-resolution images of the Earth. Other smaller devices comprised satellites from a Canadian university, Algeria and STUDSAT, a light-weight rocket made by Indian engineering students, the Indian Space Research Organization said. Monday's launch came two months after an Indian satellite powered for the first time by a home-made cryogenic engine failed in what was seen as a setback to the country's space ambitions. ISRO spokesman S. Satish told CNN that scientists have identified the causes behind April's misfire. India now aims to test the same domestically built technology within a year, he said. The South Asian nation has an expansive space program. In 2008, India sent its first unmanned mission to the moon, called Chandrayaan-I. Chandrayaan-1, meaning moon craft, dropped a TV-sized probe on the lunar surface, completed more than 3,400 orbits and met most of its scientific objectives in 312 days before vanishing off radars abruptly last year, according to the space agency. The satellite carried payloads from the United States, the European Union and Bulgaria. One of its aims was to search for evidence of water or ice and identify the chemical composition of certain lunar rocks. The Chandrayaan-1 mission came to be seen in India as the 21st century Asian version of the space race between the United States and the former Soviet Union -- but this time involving India and China. China launched a manned space flight in October 2003, becoming the third nation in the world to put a person into orbit. India has not launched any manned space flights. Satish said the Indian agency also was planning to launch a second version of Chandrayaan in 2013. India held its first rocket launch from a fishing village in southern India in 1963. Now, the South Asian nation lists more than 60 events as ""milestones"" in its space program, which includes the successful use of polar and geosynchronous satellite launch vehicles. Indian scientists say their country has the world's largest constellation of remote-sensing satellites.These satellites, according to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center, capture images of the Earth used in a range of applications -- agriculture, water resources, urban development, mineral prospecting, environment, forestry, drought and flood forecasting, ocean resources and disaster management. Another major system, or INSAT, is used for communication, television and meteorology.","The payload ranged from a remote-sensing satellite to a student-built mini-spacecraft.

"(CNN) -- An explosion and fire at a U.S. Steel plant in Clairton, Pennsylvania, Wednesday injured at least 15 people, an Allegheny County Emergency Management spokesman told CNN. Kevin Evanto said authorities got a 911 call shortly after 9:30 a.m. reporting the blast at the United States Steel Corporation's Clairton Plant, which the company says is the largest coke manufacturing facility in the United States. ""It appears one of the coke ovens at the plant exploded,"" Evanto said. Most of the injuries are burn-related, he said, although one person was taken to the hospital with chest pains. Victims are being treated at various hospitals in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area, Evanto added, with one person being transported by helicopter. ""At this point, we believe everybody is accounted for,"" the spokesman said. The United States Steel Corporation told CNN in an e-mail Wednesday it is investigating the incident. ""U. S. Steel's Security & Fire Protection Services personnel are working with local emergency responders,"" wrote company spokeswoman Erin DiPietro. ""We will assess the extent of repairs and impact on operations at a later time."" The plant has 12 coke oven batteries that produce approximately 4.7 million tons of coke annually, according to the United States Steel Corporation website. The ovens heat coal at extremely high temperatures to carbonize it so it becomes coke -- a fuel used for producing steel. Fire crews were still on the scene at midday, extinguishing remaining flames, Evanto said. Video from CNN affiliate WPXI showed ambulances and emergency crews in front of the coke plant. It also showed a side of the facility that was missing an entire wall, with cinder blocks strewn across a wide area. The plant is located about 15 miles south of Pittsburgh. CNN's Mark Bixler, Stephanie Gallman & Mythili Rao contributed to this report.","15 people were hurt in a coke plant explosion, an emergency spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- The stepmother of missing Oregon boy Kyron Horman attempted to hire a landscaper to kill her husband several months ago, CNN affiliates KGW and KATU reported Monday, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. KGW reported that sources believe the woman, Terri Horman, approached the landscaper, who had been working on the family's property in northwest Portland, Oregon, and offered the man ""a large sum of money"" to kill her husband, Kaine Horman. Investigators informed Kaine Horman of the murder-for-hire plot and said his wife may have tried to hire others as well, KGW reported, citing sources familiar with the conversation. Terri Horman said she was in a bad marriage and claimed that her husband had ""hurt"" her, according to the sources. The Oregonian newspaper, citing anonymous sources, reported that when detectives confronted her with the allegations, she denied the plot. KATU's sources confirmed that report. News about the plot could explain why Kaine Horman abruptly moved out of the family home in late June, taking the couple's toddler daughter with him. He then filed for divorce and was granted a restraining order. A few days later, Terri Horman hired a high-profile defense attorney, Stephen Houze. Calls to Houze by CNN Monday were not immediately returned. Terri Horman has been the subject of intense scrutiny during the investigation into Kyron's disappearance because she was the last person with him before he vanished on June 4. However, police have not called her a suspect in the case. She said she last saw the 7-year-old walking down a hallway toward his second-grade classroom at Skyline Elementary School in Portland, according to the police. Kyron's family has publicly pleaded with his stepmother to provide the police with more information about the boy.","Terri Horman attempted to hire a man to kill her husband, affiliate sources say .

"New York (CNN) -- Four hundred Canada geese from Brooklyn's Prospect Park were herded into crates and euthanized last week in an effort to reduce their number near New York's airports, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture. Measures to lower the number of Canada geese close to John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia international airports have been in place since last summer, said Carol Bannerman, spokeswoman for the USDA's Wildlife Services. New York City officials asked for federal assistance with solving the goose problem after US Airways flight 1549 was cripped by a bird strike and narrowly avoided crashing by successfully landing in the Hudson River in January 2009. ""Our responsibility is to look at safety hazards and the Canada geese can represent a significant aviation hazard,"" Bannerman said. The round-up last week came to light in New York media on Tuesday. The group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) issued a statement criticizing the euthanization and calling on authorities to use other methods to keep birds away from airports. ""Killing every goose within a seven-mile radius of an airport doesn't fly -- it isn't humane, and it isn't a viable solution for either people or birds,"" PETA said in the statement. ""When geese are killed, more birds simply move in to use available resources, and the temporary spike in the food supply results in accelerated breeding. What follows is a vicious killing cycle that is cruel, expensive, and pointless."" The group cited other methods including a radar system at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to detect flocks of birds, as well as lasers and pyrotechnics, as being better ways to change birds' flight paths. The Brooklyn geese, which are molting at this time of year and cannot fly, were herded into a fenced area, put in poultry crates and taken to a facility where they were euthanized with carbon dioxide, said Bannerman. The geese were later bagged and buried in a landfill, she said. Last month the radius from JFK and LaGuardia airports where Canada geese would be removed and euthanized was increased from five to seven miles and Bannerman said the new radius included Brooklyn's Prospect Park. ""JFK and LaGuardia are between six and seven miles from Prospect Park border-to-border,"" she said adding that she understood that attachment that people in the area have to the geese. ""We made the process as least stressful as possible for the geese,"" she said. Ed Bahlman, who said he is 60 years old and has been going to Prospect Park most of his life, called the removal of the geese ""unnecessary."" He said that he and his companion go to the park most mornings at around 7 a.m, and had started feeding a goose they called ""Beaky"" early last year. The goose had lost it's upper beak to a fishing hook. ""On Wednesday all the geese were there, we fed Beaky and on Thursday they were gone. Beaky was gone, too,"" he said. Bahlman who said he found zip ties and rope in the park said that the authorities had accomplished nothing by killing the geese. ""They have done a lot of harm and we don't believe they have done anything to help the public, they've done more harm than good,"" he said. Peter Brown, who said he was a fireman who has lived in the area all his life and goes to the park regularly with his 10 year old son said that although he thought the geese were beautiful and understood that it had upset the neighborhood, he agreed with the decision to remove them. ""What's more important, 200 geese or 200 people? That's the choice that has to be made,"" he said adding that he flies frequently. Bannerman said Canada geese were responsible for over 600 damaging airstrikes to U.S. planes between 1990 and 2008, and that their population was rapidly increasing. ""The Canada goose population increased from 19,000 in 1981 to 250,000 in 2008, making it a 12-fold increases in almost 30 years,"" she said. Bannerman said that 1,200 Canada geese were euthanized in 2009 in 17 New York locations.","The geese were euthanized by carbon dioxide .

"(CNN) -- A European space probe headed toward its next target Sunday after sending back detailed images of an asteroid that scientists hope will increase understanding of how the solar system evolved. Pictures of the asteroid Lutetia from the Rosetta probe's deep space fly-by Saturday are some of the most detailed ever taken, the European Space Agency said. The images, taken while the probe raced by at 15 kilometers (9 miles) per second, show a deeply pockmarked, irregular rock -- possibly left over from the birth of the solar system. Holger Sierks with the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research described the asteroid as ""a very old object"" in a statement Saturday. ""Tonight we have seen a remnant of the solar system's creation,"" he said. The surface of the asteroid, shaped like a big potato, has deep craters covering its 130-kilometer length. The Rosetta craft came within 3,162 km (1,965 miles) of Lutetia, orbiting just beyond Mars. The probe spent several hours shooting images of the irregular shaped space rock, circling more than 450 million km (280 million miles) out from the sun. The space agency says its OSIRIS camera was able to capture detail down to just a few dozen meters. The next stop for the Rosetta spacecraft -- named for the stone that helped decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics -- is comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko. If all goes according to plan, the probe will intercept the comet in 2014. The two will travel in tandem for several months as the comet hurtles from near Jupiter's orbit toward the Sun, with Rosetta finally touching down on the surface to take samples. CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report.","Scientists say the asteroid Lutetia is a remnant of the solar system's creation .

"Washington (CNN) -- While the BP oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico has put accidental spills squarely in the national spotlight, one U.S. senator is warning of another possible threat: deliberate sabotage. Democrat Jim Webb of Virginia is calling on the Obama administration to develop plans to safeguard offshore platforms from attack by terrorists. The senator, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made his case in a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. ""While Congress will continue to scrutinize BP and regulatory agencies, I write to urge you to also be vigilant against deliberate acts, such as an attack or sabotage, that could similarly devastate the region,"" Webb said in the letter, referring to the Gulf Coast. But he wants the security plans adopted for all U.S. coastal areas. While there are no oil derricks off Virginia's coast, Webb, the state's senior senator, favors oil and gas exploration in Virginia waters. He also backs a controversial moratorium in deepwater drilling ordered by the Interior Department, until risks and safeguards can be better assessed. Webb notes in the letter that the BP oil spill is the worst environmental disaster in the country's history. He said that, ""With dozens of wells operating in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, we must employ policies that mitigate all types of risk."" The senator said that a lack of vigilance on security issues ""could leave the marine ecosystem, as well as certain areas of our national security, at great risk."" He's asking the federal agencies to assess how vulnerable offshore oil rigs are to attack and make recommendations to Congress for safeguarding them. The senator points out in his letter that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires that nuclear reactors be able to withstand plane crashes and said similar standards should be considered for the oil and gas industry. Webb's request for security measures comes as he prepares for a possible rematch in 2012 with Republican George Allen, the incumbent he narrowly defeated in 2006. Allen, a former governor, also supports oil and gas exploration off Virginia's coast.","Senator Webb of Virginia warns of terror threat to offshore oil rigs .

"(CNN) -- When Youssef Boutros Ghali slipped into the role of Egypt's finance minister in 2004, the country's economy was poised for rapid growth. Youssef Boutros Ghali is a strong advocate of economic reform in Egypt . After spending the previous ten years hovering around the four percent mark, gross domestic product (GDP) jumped to 5.6 percent (2004/2005). By the end of 2007, it had shot up to 7.1 percent. According to the International Monetary Fund, the end of 2004 marked the start of Egypt's ""growth spurt."" Between then and March 2007, 2.4 million jobs were created, reducing unemployment to nine percent. Money from the Gulf flowed in, pushing up land prices and driving Egypt's stock market to a record high. The benchmark index, the CASE 30, rose 51 percent in 2007 and continued to climb in the first few weeks of 2008. This year, Egypt topped the World Bank's list of ""reformers"": countries where it has become easier to do business. However, with growth has come inflation. In March 2007, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) peaked at 12.8 percent. The government says it's since fallen to around eight percent, but some analysts are skeptical of official figures, saying the real number could be much higher. Egypt's also facing a groundswell of criticism from poorer members of society who say they're not seeing any benefits from the economic boom. According to the World Bank, 17 percent of the population is living in poverty, surviving on less than one dollar a day. In the past few years, Egypt has started selling off state assets, partly to raise money for social programs. One of the biggest sales came in 2006 with the $1.6 billion auction of 80 percent of the Bank of Alexandria to Italian bank San Paolo. Charles Hodson spoke with Egyptian Finance Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali in London, and asked him whether there was still the political will within Egypt to continue with such large-scale privatizations. (YBG): The political will is there. The question is, do we still have such large-scale privatizations? What we have created is the momentum for a private sector presence in Egypt; a significant, important dominant private sector in Egypt. We would like them to lead but we can't flood them with all sorts of assets that they may or may not want to buy. So we as the private sector is willing and we will provide them with the assets. But we're pretty soon going to be running out of private assets to privatize. (CH): The proportion of people who are living in absolute poverty in Egypt is approaching 20 percent. What kind of pressure does that impose on you as you formulate this kind of policy? (YBG): We are deeply concerned about those in Egyptian society that are not touched by the reform directly, and as you say there are people who are below the poverty line, reaching almost 20 percent. These reform programs will trickle down, but they will not trickle down overnight. We have complaints in Egypt. A lot of those who are less privileged are complaining. They are complaining very loudly. What makes it worse is that we feel for them. We know that they are right to complain, and we know that they deserve some of the fruits of the reform. (CH): Take something like opening up markets, which is something you've done. You've earned praise from UNCTAD, the relevant UN body, and of course from the World Bank. But that isn't going to help the average Egyptian living in absolute poverty, or certainly not for a while. (YBG): In Egypt, we have been blessed with an economy that is flexible, that responded quickly. As soon as we took the basic structure of measure of tax and tariff reforms the economy responded right away. Our investment, our foreign direct investment went from $450 million dollars a year to $11 billion in under three years. This is a quick response. Now we're hoping that we will have an equally quick response in reaching to the underprivileged. (CH): So reform is clearly a good word in Egypt, but so far only on the economic scale. Is there a feeling that it has to flow over into the political sphere, that there has to be political reform? (YBG): It already has spilled over into the political sphere. It has been spilling over in the political sphere for the past five, six, seven years. The dynamics are different in the political sphere. It's a lot more difficult to get the political reforms we want than it is to get the economic ones. Both -- and I can state this with confidence -- both are equally important; they just happen to move with different dynamics.

""We want someone who can get in and relay to our readers what it is like inside these dispensaries."" It's not exactly like a food critic job. The online-only reviewer won't be showing up anonymously and sampling the wares. ""They are to review the places, not the weed,"" Tone said. ""We can't have our reviewer be stoned all the time,"" he quipped. But, he said, the ideal applicant should have ""the ability to write and be in the position of holding a state medical marijuana card."" The reviewer, he said, should know his or her way around dispensaries and be ""passionate about the issue of medical marijuana."" Colorado is one of 14 states where medical marijuana is legal by state law -- federal law still bans its use. But this week, the Obama administration announced a new policy loosening the rules regarding prosecuting criminal activity associated with medical marijuana. The Justice Department now says that prosecutors can go after traffickers but not medical marijuana patients and their caregivers. Though Westword is no longer accepting applicants for its dispensary reviewer position, they are actively working through the 120 they received and have culled the list down to under 20. The applicants run the gamut of 20-something stoners to well-educated engineers in their 50s. Some have even offered to work for free, Tone said, adding ""We won't accept that.""

"(CNN) -- It's been almost six months since the January 12 earthquake that devastated my beloved Haiti. Speaking for myself -- not for my organization Yéle Haiti -- I will say it: Speed is of the essence. I feel that progress is being made at the speed of a turtle. With the amount of money that has been raised to help our country, I was expecting to see construction projects. I was expecting to see thousands of heavy tractors and loaders lifting up rubble. I was expecting to see people relocated from tents and starting to get into temporary housing. And yet, during my last visit, just a few weeks ago, I saw very few, or none, of these. We need to work together -- no one organization or government can succeed without the help and cooperation of others. We need to work together for the people there who so badly need our help. The country needs to grow in all areas, from agriculture to health care. Many people have been working very hard with the recovery efforts since that terrible day. Many of us were there the day after the quake, and we've gone back many times since, to deliver much-needed supplies and plan ways to rebuild -- and really just to try to help the people. Unless you've been there yourself, you can't imagine the terrible conditions that still exist for so many. Impact your world: How you can help Haiti . At last count, about 1.6 million Haitians are still living in the tent camps, without enough food, or a sufficient supply of water, and certainly without any feeling of safety or security. All of these refugees are dependent on donations and have no means to support or sustain themselves. And this doesn't even include the countless people who have been reluctant to leave their land and their destroyed homes, so they are living with very little shelter on their property, in tents they've fashioned from whatever materials they could find. The unemployment rate of the country is tragic -- it's between 70 and 80 percent. At Yéle Haiti, my wife, Claudinette, and I and the staff have been doing what we can. We recently met with Leslie Voltaire, Haiti's special envoy to the United Nations, who is charged by President René Préval with facilitating the international community's efforts to make sure there's effective aid management and delivery through the offices of Bill Clinton, the U.N.'s special envoy to Haiti. So we brought Leslie to a property where we are working to show him what we're doing. We showed him how we've been serving water. We reviewed with him our plans for Yéle Kitchen, the sustainable kitchen project we are funding, which will provide hot meals for children in schools and orphanages, and which will also provide vocational training for its workers, who will be able to sell some of the food they cook. Then we showed him the most important project we're working on: the temporary housing that we want to create that would become permanent homes. We're proposing a city called Exodus. We could then start to relocate families who don't have homes into this new place. We want to work with the government to rebuild, and we want to help get families into new homes. We suggest starting with a model; the goal for Exodus is to eventually build 1,000 homes, which translates to housing for 5,000 people. We are working with the government on agreeing to a site in the area of Croix-des-Bouquets for building our first hundred units. If the government works with us in identifying people to relocate, Yéle would start with that piece of land, which has a great agricultural component to it. People will be able not only to live in the housing we're planning to build, but also to plant on that land, grow on that land, then sell their crops from stands on the streets or to commercial markets. In this way, we won't just be giving these families shelter, we'll be giving them a way to sustain themselves, either by growing their own food or -- ultimately, this is our wish -- growing enough so that they'd be able to sell some of the produce and have an income. We need to bring business back to Haiti, we need to focus on jobs -- and, of course, education. As we reach the six-month mark, let's make a renewed commitment to cooperate, collaborate, do whatever it takes to make sure the next six months are eventful in terms of real progress. Let's do what we have to do to see things start to move more quickly. No more turtle speed; let's try to pick up the pace of Haiti's rebirth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wyclef Jean.","Haiti's devastating earthquake happened six months ago .

"(CNN) -- U.S. National Guard forces will begin deploying along the U.S. border with Mexico beginning in August and will be fully trained and deployed by the end of the month, government officials announced Monday. Some 1,200 Army and Air National Guard troops will be in place for a year to assist the Border Patrol in monitoring and capturing illegal immigrants crossing the border into the United States. They will served as a ""gap-filler"" while the Customs and Border Patrol agency hires additional staff to fill the demand in protection along the almost 2,000-mile long southern border with Mexico. The troops, from the four border states, will be fully trained and in place in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas by September 1, according to Gen. Craig McKinley, commander of the National Guard. The Guard troops will not be involved in law enforcement activities such as arrests of illegal immigrants, but will assist the Border Patrol in looking for the illegal border crossers and smugglers as well as in intelligence gathering. The airmen and soldiers will be armed, but they will be limited by rules of engagement that allow them to shoot only to defend themselves, McKinley said. The deployment is part of President Barak Obama's border plan announced in late May, when he also requested $500 million in supplemental funds to try to reduce the number of immigrants and smugglers crossing the border daily. Additionally, Customs and Border Patrol will move more aircraft to the Tucson sector of the border, where an increase in human smuggling and illegal border crossings have been occurring, Federal officials said Monday. Under President George W. Bush, a border deployment of the National Guard, called Operation Jump Start, ended in 2008. The operation sent more than 6,000 troops to the four border states to repair secondary border fence, construct nearly 1,000 metal barriers and fly Border Patrol agents by helicopter to intercept illegal immigrants.","1,200 National Guard troops will help patrol Southwest border .

"Venice, Louisiana (CNN)  -- President Obama on Wednesday proposed a package of measures that would provide at least $58 million in additional funding for oil spill relief efforts and raise the tax that oil companies pay to maintain an emergency fund. In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi requesting congressional approval of the package, Obama said oil giant BP -- which owns the leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico -- was responsible for all cleanup costs. In addition, Obama said, the government would seek full compensation for all damages from BP. ""We cannot allow the potentially protracted pursuit of claims to prevent us from swift action to help those harmed by this spill,"" Obama said in the letter. The proposals would increase by 1 cent the current tax of 8 cents a barrel that oil companies pay into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, and also increase the amounts that could be spent from that fund on single incidents. Efforts to staunch the gusher continued Wednesday. The ""top-hat"" oil containment device has reached the sea floor and should be in position over the wellhead and operational by the end of the week, BP said. A larger containment vessel was unsuccessful in stopping the flow of oil from the gusher about 5,000 feet underwater. The spill is sending 210,000 gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico each day. The ""top-hat"" cofferdam, a 5-foot-tall, 4-foot-diameter structure, weighs less than 2 tons. The structure was deployed by the drill ship Enterprise. BP built the smaller dome after a much larger, four-story containment vessel, designed to cap the larger of two leaks in the well, developed glitches Saturday. Ice-like hydrate crystals formed when gas combined with water and blocked the top of the dome, making it buoyant. The new device would keep most of the water out at the beginning of the capping process and would allow engineers to pump in methanol to keep the hydrates from forming, said Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer for exploration and production. Methanol is a simple alcohol that can be used as an antifreeze. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said the success of this latest attempt to cap the well could be known in the next few days. ""On this Thursday, we should know whether or not this alternative top-hat cofferdam is going to work,"" Salazar said on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""And then the next key date is Saturday, because by Saturday they will have the diagnostics completed through X-rays and gamma rays and pressure ratings to be able to make decisions about what the next steps are."" If attempts to cap the well fail, BP may try to plug the leak by shooting debris -- shredded tires, golf balls and similar objects -- under extremely high pressure into the well's blowout preventer in an attempt to clog it and stop the leak. The blowout preventer has been partially successful in sealing the well, but did not fully close when the rig exploded and sank. Suttles said BP also is drilling a relief well to try to divert the flow to another pipe. ""That started about a week ago,"" Suttles said. ""That work continues. The well is at about 9,000 feet."" It may take up to three months to reach the target area, and progress will slow the deeper the drill bit goes, said David Nagel, executive vice president of BP America. Federal investigators are still trying to determine what caused the explosion that sank the Deepwater Horizon, which was owned by BP contractor Transocean Ltd. The oil rig exploded April 20 and sank two days later, about 50 miles off the southeast coast of Louisiana. BP is legally required to cover economic damages from the spill up to $75 million. But Florida Sen. Bill Nelson has introduced legislation that would raise the liability cap to $10 billion. iReport: Share images from the Gulf . ""If this gusher continues for several months, it's going to cover up the Gulf Coast and it's going to get down into the loop current, and that's going to take it down the Florida Keys and up the east coast of Florida,"" Nelson said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union. ""And you are talking about massive economic loss to our tourism, our beaches, to our fisheries, very possibly disruption of our military testing and training,"" he said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Vernon Baker earned a Medal of Honor for his actions during World War II. But because of what the U.S. government acknowledges was racism against African-Americans who performed heroically in the war, it took more than 50 years for him to get what he had earned. Baker, one of only seven African-Americans to receive the nation's highest military honor from World War II, died Tuesday at his home in Idaho, according to his hometown police and coroner's offices. He passed away after a long battle with cancer. His wife and members of his family were by his side. He was 90 years old. Baker was orphaned at the age of 4, and was raised first by his grandparents and later at Father Flanagan's Boys Town in Nebraska. He joined the Army six months before the Pearl Harbor attack and was part of the 92nd Infantry Division, the first unit of ""colored"" soldiers to see combat in World War II. He eventually rose to the rank of lieutenant and was leading a platoon against entrenched German machine gun nests near Viareggio, Italy, on April 5, 1945. His official Medal of Honor citation describes what he did: . ""When his company was stopped by the concentration of fire from several machine gun emplacements, he crawled to one position and destroyed it, killing three Germans. Continuing forward, he attacked and enemy observation post and killed two occupants. With the aid of one of his men, Lieutenant Baker attacked two more machine gun nests, killing or wounding the four enemy soldiers occupying these positions. He then covered the evacuation of the wounded personnel of his company by occupying an exposed position and drawing the enemy's fire."" After spending the better part of a day putting his life at risk to lead his unit, Baker was back in action the next evening: . ""On the following night Lieutenant Baker voluntarily led a battalion advance through enemy mine fields and heavy fire toward the division objective."" Baker was originally awarded the Army's Distinguished Service Cross for his action. But in the early 1990s, a study was done to find why none of the more than 400 World War II Medal of Honor recipients was black. The study found ""a racial disparity in the way Medal of Honor recipients were selected."" Seven African American heroes from World War II were chosen to receive the Medal of Honor from President Bill Clinton. Four of them had died in the war, and two others had died in the time since the war. Only Baker was at the White House to have the iconic star and pale blue ribbon draped around his neck. During an interview with CNN before the White House ceremony on January 13, 1997, Baker spoke about the racism that delayed recognition of him and his fellow Medal of Honor recipients: ""As I look back on it, it really makes me feel sad that we did our job, we fought, but we weren't appreciated"" After the White House ceremony, Baker told CNN, ""I still don't feel like a hero. I just feel I was a soldier and I did my job, and I think I was rewarded for it."" Baker is survived by his wife, Heidy, and five children. He is expected to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.","Baker, who received the Medal of Honor more than 50 years after his heroic acts, dies at 90 .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama's choice for running mate will be announced to supporters in a text message Saturday morning, senior Obama campaign officials told CNN on Friday night, and a senior party official said it won't be Sen. Hillary Clinton. Sen. Barack Obama says he has decided on his running mate but is not yet ready to reveal the name. Obama called some people on his short list for the vice presidential slot Thursday night to tell them he had not selected them as a running mate, a highly placed Democratic Party source said. A senior Democratic official who had spoken with Clinton told CNN late Friday that the Obama campaign has communicated to her through private channels that she will not be Obama's vice presidential pick. Also, sources close to Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine said he has been informed he was not selected. One source told CNN that Obama personally made the call to Kaine. Another source said Kaine has flown to Denver, Colorado, for the Democratic National Convention. See who's in the running . It is not known who else may have gotten calls. However, late Friday two Democratic sources confirmed that Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh is also out of the running. Most of this week's buzz had been around Bayh of Indiana, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware and Kaine. The contenders kept a low profile and Biden has avoided any lengthy interviews. Rep. Chet Edwards said Friday that the campaign had vetted him but that he hasn't talked to Obama.  Watch panelists weigh in on top VP contenders » . Edwards, 56, is a nine-term congressman representing the Central Texas district that includes President Bush's ranch near Crawford. This month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi touted Edwards as a dark horse contender for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. The presumptive Democratic nominee was working Friday in Chicago, Illinois, on his address for the convention. He will launch a string of rallies with his running mate on Saturday in Springfield, Illinois. Obama said Thursday that he had made his decision but declined to give further details. ""I won't comment on anything else until I introduce our running mate to the world,"" Obama said in Emporia, Virginia. ""That's all you're going to get out of me."" Watch Obama say he's made his choice » . Clinton re-entered the running mate conversation this week after a poll indicating that nearly half of her supporters have yet to embrace Obama. The Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll out Wednesday night said 52 percent of Clinton supporters said they will vote for Obama. Twenty-one percent favor Republican Sen. John McCain, while 27 percent are undecided or say they will vote for ""someone else.'' The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. The former first lady was considered one of the top VP contenders shortly after she ended her White House run in June, but rumors of lingering tension between the former rivals and word that her name would be placed in nomination at the convention are partially to blame for political observers kicking her out of the top tier. Other big names thought to be in the running included retired Gen. Wesley Clark, Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, former Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.

Manchin, a popular two-term Democratic governor, told reporters this month that he ""would highly consider"" seeking the seat himself -- not surprising given Manchin was thought to be interested in running for the Senate in 2012, when the election is currently scheduled. West Virginia law dictates that the governor has the power to name an immediate replacement for Byrd. Manchin says he doesn't want to appoint someone who would serve for two-and-a-half years without the people's consent. ""I believe in the power of the vote,"" Manchin told reporters. If the contest is held this November, it would add another possible Senate pick up potential for the Republicans and would help their odds at possibly retaking control of the chamber. The GOP needs to re-take 10 Senate seats to regain the majority. The state's largest union, the West Virginia chapter of the AFL-CIO, has urged Manchin to name himself to the seat, but the governor has said he will not do so. Byrd was the longest serving member ever in Congressional history.","Gov. Joe Machin will name a temporary replacement for the late Sen. Robert Byrd .

"(CNN)  -- Anne Frank, the young Jewish girl who detailed her thoughts and her family's life while hiding in an attic from the Nazis in Amsterdam, can now be seen in rare video that has been posted on the Internet. Anne Frank got a diary as a gift shortly before her family went into hiding from the Nazis. The only known footage of Frank, who died in a concentration camp weeks before World War II ended, can be seen on a special YouTube channel run by the Anne Frank Museum. The channel manager, Ita Amahorseija, said the virtual museum was created ""to not only give back to the people who know the story of Anne Frank, but to trigger people to want to know more about her story."" In the silent black-and-white footage, the 12-year-old diarist can be seen as she leans out the window of her home to watch her newly married neighbor leave the apartment building on July 22, 1941.  Watch the video » . That newlywed couple gave the film to Anne's father after the war. Other videos show the chestnut tree that Anne saw every day from her window and the church bells that rang while she was in hiding. She mentions both of these in her diary. Otto Frank can be heard on the site, talking about his daughter's diaries in a video excerpt made in the late 1960s before his death. He said she talked about and criticized many things, but he learned her real feelings only by reading her diary. ""I was very much surprised about deep thoughts Anne had, a seriousness, especially her self-criticism. It was quite a different Anne I had known as my daughter. She never really showed this kind of inner feeling,"" Otto Frank said. The video of the happy young Anne has had more than 2 million page views since its posting a week ago. That expansive reach has led other museums to use YouTube to reach a broader audience and to offer a taste of what's available on their Web sites. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, England, has one of the largest art and design collections in the world. On the V&A YouTube channel, you can see a master hat maker craft a haute-couture hat by hand, from start to finish, for designer Stephen Jones.

"(CNN) -- A car bomb killed at least four people in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, authorities said. It was the first time a car bomb has been used to attack federal police, said the city's mayor, Jose Reyes Ferriz. The incident happened about 8 p.m. Thursday in the city's most violent zone. Juarez municipal police spokesman Jacinto Seguro said Friday that federal police were responding to a call that a police officer had been killed. ""When they went to check the car, there was a dead body in there, dressed up like a police officer, but it wasn't one of ours,"" Seguro said. ""They put him in a civilian car but dressed him up in a municipal police uniform. That's when the bomb went off. It's like an act of terrorism."" Two police officers, a paramedic and a civilian were killed, federal police spokesman Ramon Salinas said. Six people, including a local news cameraman, were injured in the blast, authorities said. Four people -- three paramedics and a civilian -- were still being treated for injuries, police said. It was unclear how severe the injuries are. Canal 5 video footage from moments after the blast captures seconds of confusion, followed by fires and debris scattered across the street. At one point, the cameraman shooting the video reaches for an injured civilian, and a police officer says, ""Grab onto my arm. Grab onto my arm."" Although Mexican authorities say the attack was the result of a car bomb, a counterterrorism expert said there is ""some confusion"" about exactly what caused the car to explode. ""For this to be an improvised grenade attack, in some capacity, it doesn't surprise me,"" said Fred Burton, vice president of intelligence at Stratfor, a privately owned global Intelligence service. But if this particular car bomb was manufactured to the level of sophistication similar to those used by terrorist groups like Hezbollah, then this is a significant event, Burton said. ""The devil is in the details,"" he added. Jose Marulanda, a security analyst based in Bogota, Colombia, called Friday's bombing a ""turning point"" in Mexico's drug war and found it remniscent of Colombia's own battle with cartels and car bombs in the 1990s. ""Because if they decide to start using car bombs one against the other ... then the whole society, bystanders, innocent people could be affected,"" he told CNN. He said that while Friday's car bombing did not appear very sophisticated, he noted that Mexican drug cartels are often advised by former members of Colombian cartels. He said the Colombian cartels are influenced by FARC, the guerrilla group which has waged war against the Colombian government for decades and ""has a lot of experience with explosives."" ""We could expect more sophistication day after day if they decided to go on with these car bombs,"" he said. According to Seguro, the Juarez cartel claimed the deadly incident in a graffiti message found in downtown Juarez. In what appears to be black spray paint, the violent drug cartel wrote, ""what happened on September avenue will keep happening to all the authorities who keep supporting El Chapo. Sincerely - the Juarez cartel."" The threatening message concluded: ""We still have car bombs."" ""This is significant because usually it's La Linea, the Juarez cartel's operatives, that sign the messages,"" Reyes said. ""It's as if to say, 'Now, it's the big guys in charge, not the operatives.'"" Salinas said the blast in the Mexican border city took place as authorities were responding to ""some sort of emergency."" Earlier in the day, police announced the arrest of Jesus Armando Acosta Guerrero, believed to be a leader in the Juarez cartel -- one of two drug trafficking organizations operating in the area. There had been relative calm in the city since elections were held there July 4. But Thursday's explosion and an attack Sunday against Mexican federal police mark the third and fourth major incidents in recent weeks. On June 29, a shooting between suspected drug traffickers and Mexican federal police left one officer dead. The shooting was seen as a watershed moment in the ongoing border drug war: Several bullets from that gunfight strayed across the border into Texas, hitting El Paso City Hall. There were no injuries reported on the U.S. side. On April 24, six federal police officers were killed in a daylight shooting in Juarez. Hours later, a painted message found in the city, allegedly from members of La Linea, claimed responsibility for the attack. La Linea is an extension of the Juarez cartel, made up in part of former Juarez police officers, according to authorities. Assaults against federal police have increased since they took full control of security in the city from the Mexican military on April 9. ""There have been at least a dozen, maybe 15, attacks against the federal police since we took over"" security, Salinas said. The Juarez cartel and the Sinaloa cartel have been in a bloody turf war since 2008. More than 5,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence in Juarez during the turf war, according to local authorities. CNN's Nick Valencia and CNN en Espanol's Gustavo Valdes contributed to this story.","NEW: Analyst: Bombing could be a ""turning point"" in Mexico's drug war .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- The verdict so far: generally good news but still some uncertainty about whether there's a leak in BP's well in the Gulf of Mexico, now fitted with a containment cap. That's the assessment of the retired Coast Guard admiral overseeing the government's response to the oil spill, more than 24 hours into a critical test checking the well's ability to hold up under pressure. Thad Allen reported Friday afternoon that pressure is rising in the well, a sign that the well is holding and that the leak that had been spewing oil into the Gulf for nearly three months can be contained. But pressure readings have not reached the optimal level. Pressure was up to 6,700 pounds per square inch inside the well's capping stack, he said. More than a day into the ""well integrity"" test, pressure above 7,500 pounds per square inch would indicate ""high integrity and low potential for a leak,"" according to Allen. What does 6,700 pounds per square inch mean? Government scientists and BP experts aren't quite sure. It could be a leak, or it could simply be that so much oil has spilled out already, it's taking a while to build up pressure. ""In general, as the president noted today, this is generally good news,"" Allen said. But he added, ""I think we're at a point where there's enough uncertainty about the meaning of the pressure that we're seeing that we have to use due diligence moving forward. We don't want to do harm or create a situation that cannot be reversed."" Allen said the government has told BP to proceed with the test but intensify monitoring of the well, by conducting seismic and acoustic tests and visual inspections of the sea floor using robots. In addition, a government ship is in the area, fitted with equipment for detecting methane gas, which would be an indication of a leak. The ""well integrity test"" began Thursday after two days of delays, first as government scientists scrutinized testing procedures and then as BP replaced a leaking piece of equipment known as a choke line. The oil stopped gushing out Thursday afternoon, the first time BP has been able to gain control since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 and triggered the catastrophe. All that was made possible by a new, tightly fitting containment cap. BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said later in a telephone conference following Allen's that two robots trolling the sea floor in the area of the well bore and two others capturing sonar data have not detected any breaching. ""At this point, there is no evidence the well bore has been breached, so that's good news,"" he said. ""The current monitoring that we do shows no negative evidence."" He said the well integrity test is proceeding as planned, and the pressure readings so far, while not optimal, are ""consistent with BP's engineering analysis"" and ""do not give us any indication that we do not have well integrity."" Wells said also said that work restarted Friday on the drilling of the first of two relief wells, seen as a more permanent way to plug and seal the breached well. They're expected to be completed in August. One serves as a backup to the other. When they are ready, mud and cement will be pumped into one of the relief wells to permanently seal BP's crippled well. Allen and BP officials initially had said that the test results would be closely scrutinized at six-hour intervals and that the integrity test could go on for 48 hours. But at this point, they're focusing on each six hours, with no guarantee the test will last two days. When the test is wrapped up, valves are expected to be reopened to resume siphoning oil to two ships on the surface, the Q4000 and Helix Producer, as government and BP officials assess the data and decide what to do next. Two more ships are due to join them in coming weeks, bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels (about 3.4 million gallons) of oil a day, more than high-end estimates of how much oil had been leaking. But it's possible some oil may be released into the Gulf again, before all the ships are ready. As results came in Friday morning, President Barack Obama spoke about the developments with a note of caution. ""I think it's important that we don't get ahead of ourselves here,"" he said. ""You know, one of the problems with having this camera down there is that when the oil stops gushing, everybody feels like we're done, and we're not. We won't be done until we actually know that we killed the well and have a permanent solution in place."" The president expects to return to the Gulf Coast in the next few weeks. The White House announced that first lady Michelle Obama will return to the Gulf region next week to meet with Coast Guard personnel who've been responding to the oil spill and to christen a Coast Guard cutter named in honor of Dorothy Stratton, the service branch's first female commissioned officer. The visit will take place in Mississippi on Friday. Meanwhile, Gulf residents are happy simply that no oil is being released now. ""See the smile? That's my reaction,"" Jamie Munoz said. ""But it's cautious optimism. Obviously, I'm very happy. It's been our goal for 88 days now. It's been a long run. But, hopefully, we get it done right and begin the cleaning. That's the most important part. Let's clean up and get our fishermen back to work."" BP also reported that it has paid more than $200 million in claims to 32,000 Gulf Coast residents. The largest groups of claimants include fishermen, who have received $32 million, and shrimpers, who have received $18 million, the company said in a news release. It said that about $77 million has been paid for loss of income to workers on ships, at seafood processing plants and other businesses. .","NEW: BP official: No indication we don't have well integrity .

"(Mashable) -- It'd be an understatement to say that this has been a terrible week for Apple, and we haven't even reached the halfway point. On Monday, Consumer Reports dealt a devastating blow to the iPhone 4 when it declined to recommend the device to consumers due to the antenna reception problem. Consumer Reports concluded from its tests that cell reception is indeed lost if you cover up the small gap between the two metal bands on the bottom left corner (as it's facing you) of the phone. The media quickly picked up the story. Tuesday wasn't any better for the tech giant. Consumer Reports slammed Apple for not providing a fix to customers at no extra cost. Some have even suggested that a recall was imminent -- an endeavor that would cost the company $1.5 billion. All of this news resulted in a sharp dive in Apple's stock price, although it has since made a partial recovery. There are even class action lawsuits waiting in the wings. Apple has a nightmare on its hands, and no software fix will make the problem go away. The issue has taken on a life of its own. The situation isn't impossible for Apple to recover from, though. However, the company needs to take action, and it needs to do it quick. Here are what my top five priorities would be if I were in Steve Jobs' shoes: . 1. Acknowledge that the antenna problem is real . While you can't call the data conclusive, you can say that the data overwhelmingly points to one conclusion: the iPhone has an antenna problem. The iPhone antenna issue has been replicated in countless YouTube videos and by multiple media organizations, including us. Apple's internal documents show that they know the issue is real. This is almost certainly a hardware issue, and it's time that Apple stopped being coy and just admit that the phone does have an issue with its reception. The current string of denials and half-truths won't have any legs as the pressure mounts and the lawyers come knocking. The best thing the company can do is issue an open letter on the antenna issue, ideally from Steve Jobs himself. The key to making this go away is transparency. 2. Go into the technical details . Once Apple acknowledges the problem, it needs to give up details, such as the science behind the antenna issue, why the company didn't catch it during testing, and different potential fixes. Don't spare the public the complicated and scientific issues behind the iPhone's design and how different grips affect reception -- anything less won't appease a critical public. 3. Roll out the software update . Apple has promised a software update earlier this month to ""fix"" the formula used to calculate signal bar strength display, which the company pointed to as the root of the iPhone antenna problem. While we believe that the software fix was meant to be a decoy to the real hardware issue, the company has already committed to the software update, and it should roll it out as promised. Don't keep trying to point to software as the problem, though: most people are aware that it's not a software bug causing the antenna issue and treating it as such is just demeaning and condescending to iPhone users everywhere. 4. Make the bumpers free . Out of all of my suggestions, this one is the key. Those iPhone bumpers may cost $29.00 in the Apple Store, but in reality the rubber and plastic mold only costs a fraction of that price (possibly around $1 per bumper). Providing that accessory to customers for free solves the antenna issue, as bare skin has to touch the iPhone 4's metal casing in order to drop signal. It's not an ideal fix, but it's far better than the other option: a recall. 5. No matter what, don't issue an iPhone 4 recall . Some have suggested that Apple should recall the iPhone 4. That isn't a simple affair. In fact, most users would be more annoyed and upset than pleased with the Cuptertino-based company. Let's play out the scenario. Apple performs a recall of its devices. Millions of people are annoyed as they either have to give up their device or keep a clearly defective one. Apple, already at peak production capacity, would take weeks -- if not months -- to replace the phones. Estimates place the cost of a recall in the billions. Here's the truth: The iPhone 4 antenna issue isn't a hazardous one. It isn't exploding in people's hands, it isn't cutting anyone's palms randomly, and it isn't suddenly bursting into flames. Those are critical issues that would require a recall. The antenna issue, while important and a problem that Apple should have found and addressed before the product's launch last month, doesn't rise to that level. Recalls are meant only as a last resort. Do you think Ford is going to recall all of its cars for a faulty radio? Apple, while it may be feeling the pressure, can't cave to it. There is a balance here. It has to be truthful with what's actually wrong with the iPhone antenna and what is not. It has to keep its emotions in check as it discusses the antenna independent of the iPhone 4's many other amazing features. And finally, the company has to give customers something to solve the issue. Free bumpers seem like the appropriate middle ground. A recall is over-the-top extreme and hurts rather than helps consumers in the end. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama told reporters Friday he did not feel the earthquake that rattled parts of suburban Washington early in the morning. The rare quake, which struck about 5 a.m., was centered about 20 miles northwest of the capital, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It had a magnitude of 3.6 -- relatively mild by earthquake standards but stronger than any other quake to shake the region in the past 35 years, the agency said. Steve Dolce, a CNN technical manager, said his house in Germantown, Maryland, ""vibrated slightly"" for about 10 seconds. ""I looked out the window ... wondered if it was a plane or something, then I checked my BlackBerry and saw a dozen e-mails alerting the small quake,"" he added. The earthquake was the first with a magnitude of more than 3 near Washington since 1974, said Amy Vaughan, a geophysicist at the USGS National Earthquake Information Center. ""This is a significant event for the region,"" she said. About an hour after the quake, Vaughan said, more than 5,500 people had reported feeling it across Maryland, in nearby Washington, and in states including West Virginia, Virginia and Delaware. ""It was really loud, like a plane flying really low. I had never felt anything like it,"" said Anne Ngunjiri, 30, of Gaithersburg, Maryland. ""I was jolted out of bed. All my neighbors woke up. After it passed, I thought it could be an earthquake, and lay in bed hoping there were no aftershocks."" Judy Rudolph, 64, said she was writing e-mails in bed in Rockville, Maryland, when her house started to shake. ""My first reaction was the noise ... I thought it was an explosion,"" she said. She said she'd never felt anything like it in her 31 years living there. Until Friday, the largest earthquake recorded within about 50 miles of Gaithersberg since 1974 was a 2.7-magnitude quake in 1993, Vaughan said. But geologically speaking, she said it was ""not completely unexpected"" for a 3.6-magnitude quake to hit there. ""Occasionally these things do happen even east of the Rockies, even though it's not really on a plate boundary where we expect earthquakes. ... Faults do exist from when the continent was forming. There are small faults that do exist within this area,"" she said. Vaughan said major structural damage was unlikely, but people may experience aftershocks for the next day, or even a week or two after the quake. Washington's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency said no injuries or property damage had been reported. The last earthquake in Maryland occurred on October 8, 2007, according to the USGS website. It was a 1.7-magnitude quake centered about 5 miles northwest of Baltimore. CNN's Bob Kovach contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama says he did not feel the 3.6-magnitude earthquake Friday morning .

"(CNN) -- Actor and director Mel Gibson appears to be at it again. This time the issue is not a tirade berating Jews and women in front of police officers. Instead, it's an outrageous message that was apparently left on his girlfriend's answering machine and likely was never supposed to come under public scrutiny. The despicable message ended with the voice of someone purported to be Gibson telling his girlfriend that her dress was so provocative, she was likely to be ""gang-raped by a bunch of n*****s."" The audio recording, one of several, appeared on the website RadarOnline. (CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the tapes.) Let's set aside for the moment whatever Gibson's psychological issues may be. Of even more concern are what such ""behind the scenes"" remarks can tell us about ourselves and our culture. Americans, so anxious to believe that we have entered into a ""post-racial era,"" tend to ignore the one element needed to corroborate such a conclusion: a lack of racial animus. Clearly over the last 40 years, our laws have greatly mitigated once commonplace displays of racism. It is rare that the N-word gets dropped publicly in a racially charged situation; again Gibson's conversation was meant to be private. In America's institutions, where there is great awareness of the legal implications, overt forms of discrimination are far less frequently seen than before. The country has made real progress. But it would be naive to imagine that racism has disappeared with the ascent of an African-American to the White House. The reality is that racism is very alive today. It has simply morphed into a more dangerous, odious and insidious form. In fact, 21st-century American racism looks and sounds precisely like the alleged Mel Gibson recording. Once upon a time a man with such evident racial prejudices would probably have owned slaves and used racial epithets publicly, with complete impunity. Moved by a combination of fear of legal action, political correctness and pure cowardice, the prejudiced have gone behind closed doors. In place of public promulgations and actions that would clearly identify someone like Gibson as the person he really is, a man like this conveys his  innermost beliefs to his girlfriend. Instead of negative sentiments about African-Americans being expressed directly to a black man's face, they're expressed in private and taught to children, family and others who can be influenced to hate. This 21st-century form of racism is running rampant in our society and it is more difficult to combat than its 20th-century cousin. By day, the prejudiced cordially converse and interact with people of all backgrounds and ethnicities. But by night, they espouse racial hatred in closeted, private circles. In the past there was something liberating in at least being able to identify those who were the real racists. Please do not misunderstand. I am not longing for a return to the days of old America when African-Americans like Emmett Till died because they looked at another person on the street. However, today there are many of us who might rather have someone call us the N-word out loud than have them smile in our faces. So what am I looking for? First, an acknowledgement that racism is still all around us. We cannot fight a problem that we do not even believe exists. Second, and even more importantly, we must quickly acknowledge the modern era of race relations in America and build a new, comprehensive set of strategies and approaches to combat this different manifestation of prejudice. There are many in the military who acknowledge that the tactics used for 20th-century warfare are not effective against the threats in this century. Conventional weaponry cannot succeed against determined terrorists who successfully melt into the civilian population. By analogy, we need to understand the profound metamorphosis of American racism and construct new ""weaponry"" to combat it. This reality has practical and policy implications. Just as we must convince people in Afghanistan of the virtues of a free society to stanch the spread of terrorism, we must focus on convincing the next generation of Americans that diversity is a great asset to be embraced, not a liability to be feared. Open discussions and dialogues about race are required. They must be built more frequently into the curriculums of our schools and promoted by reasonable minds and organizations. Leveraging the incredible strength of our nation's diversity--or failing to do so--will not only have implications for our social justice and peace internally, it will also be the single most important element defining the United States' global stature. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Blair Taylor.","Blair Taylor says in recordings released, Mel Gibson purportedly had racially offensive tirade .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- BP has put off crucial ""integrity tests"" on the new stacking cap on its ruptured Gulf oil well so it can review testing procedures, a review expected to take place through the night and into Wednesday. The oil giant had expected the tests -- to check pressure in the well and determine if it can be sealed once and for all -- to get under way Tuesday afternoon. But late Tuesday night, BP announced that additional analysis of the well testing procedure was needed. The move following a meeting with Energy Secretary Steven Chu and his team of advisers. A source informed about BP operations told CNN's John King that, ""There were some potential complications that might cause a delay -- some bad, some in the better to be safe than sorry category."" It had been hoped that the integrity tests would show whether an end is in sight to the environmental disaster that has been unfolding for the last 12 weeks. But throughout the evening, cameras some 5,000 feet below the surface showed oil gushing from the well's capping stack, indicating that valves had not been closed to begin the pressure tests. The massive custom-designed cap, which has a better seal than the last cap placed on the well, is some 30 feet high and weighs 160,000 pounds. It's hoped that it might seal the well completely. But if it's unable to contain all the oil, some could be diverted through riser pipes to ships on the surface. Under a worst-case scenario, however, tests might show there's more damage to the well's casing, meaning that capping the well would not stop the oil from flowing. Retired Adm. Thad Allen, who is leading the federal response to the oil disaster, says the well cap placement is part a ""very complex, nuanced and broad-based response"" to the rupture of the underwater well in April, an accident that killed 11 oil workers and caused worst environmental disaster in U.S. history. When they do take place, the integrity tests will measure pressure inside the well and will last anywhere from six to 48 hours. They will involve incrementally closing three valves on the new cap, a process that would allow BP to do its pressure measurements. Higher pressure readings would mean the leak is being stopped, while lower pressure indications would mean oil is escaping from other parts of the well. ""In this exercise, high pressure is good,"" Allen said. ""We are looking for somewhere between eight and nine thousand psi (pounds per square inch) inside the capping stack, which would indicate to us that the hydrocarbons are being forced up and the well bore's being able to withstand that pressure."" Allen was asked what he thought the odds were to the success of being able to shut the well with the new cap. ""I think we are very confident we can take control of this hydrocarbon stream and then slowly close all these valves and stop the emission of hydrocarbons. What we can't tell is the current condition of the well bore below the sea floor and the implication of the pressure readings,"" he said. ""That is in fact why we're doing a well integrity test."" The latest containment cap, while seeming to offer the best odds of success, wasn't ready earlier. In addition, BP has learned from previous, unsuccessful containment efforts, CNN's Ed Lavandera reported on ""The Situation Room."" Allen said that if low pressure readings persist for around a six-hour time frame, that could signal problems with the new cap . If it's determined that the cap can't seal the well completely, and some crude must be sent to the surface, the oil-gathering ship, the Helix Producer, in now in place. On Monday it joined the Q4000, which was already active. And more vessels are planned. Allen said a four-vessel system that could recover 80,000 barrels a day could be ready by the end of the month. Meanwhile, in another development Tuesday, the Obama administration sent BP and other responsible parties a fourth bill relating to the oil spill. The new bill is for $99.7 million. It comes on top of a total of $122.3 million in the first three bills. The government says the parties are responsible for all costs associated with the spill, including stopping the leak, protecting the shoreline and long-term recovery efforts. The money will help replenish a $1.5 billion federal trust fund established to pay for damages associated with oil spills. Among those costs is skimming oil on the surface of the Gulf. Allen said authorities are on pace to have around 1,000 skimmers available by the end of the month. At this point, there are fewer than 600. Work also has been continuing on the ultimate solution to fixing the problem, drilling two relief wells. But BP doesn't expect the first relief well work to be completed until August. Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil have spewed daily from BP's breached well and Allen cautions that even if the engineering containment efforts work, there is still a lot to be done in a disaster that has affected the environment and the livelihoods of people from Louisiana to Florida. ""There's still a significant amount of oil out there, and the oil recovery and the impacts of this oil will probably extend well into the fall in terms of oil coming ashore, tar balls, beach cleanup, and then we will be moving of course at that point of the natural resources damage assessment trying to understand the long-term environmental ecological impact of the event,"" Allen said. And the presidential commission tasked with investigating the Gulf oil gusher and making recommendations about the future of offshore drilling continued its public meetings Tuesday. The National Oil Spill Commission has six months to determine what happened when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded April 20 -- and how to prevent something similar from ever happening again. A new moratorium on deepwater drilling issued by the U.S. Interior Department Monday has already played a prominent role in the hearings.

"(CNN) -- The three friends pointed the nose of their 31-foot boat in the direction of the best fishing, near the oil rigs off the Louisiana coast. It was April 20, a beautiful, calm morning. They caught a netfull. Hours passed into darkness. At around 9:45 p.m., they looked out and saw what appeared, at first, like a flare. Bradley Shivers grabbed his binoculars. ""Man, this doesn't look right,"" he said to his buddies Scott Russell and Mark Mead. Shivers then reached for the boat's radio to phone another rig. But then, over the airwaves: ""Mayday, Mayday, Mayday! This is the Deepwater Horizon! We are on fire! We are abandoning the rig!"" Then a boom, an explosion. The fishermen were 18 miles away. ""It hit your chest,"" Mead recalled. ""It was like a plane flying real low, really fast,"" said Russell. ""It shook the boat. I mean, we knew it was bad."" Shivers radioed the Coast Guard. ""'Please, how many people can you hold on [your] boat?'"" he was asked. ""'We don't know, you know, maybe 20-25, we've never, basically ... this is a fishing boat. I mean, we've never put that many people on it...They're like 'Please, please help!' Shivers threw the throttle down. As the Rambling Wreck sped toward the flames, they stowed their fishing gear and pulled out life jackets, floating pillows and rope. They put on life jackets. ""We knew people were in the water,"" Russell recalled. ""We had to be ready to jump."" Mayday calls crackled on the radio. The 20 minutes it took the fishermen get to the rig felt like forever. What are we going to see when we get there? Shivers thought. The men kept communicating with the Coast Guard, describing their coordinates and what they were hearing over their radio as they closed in on Deepwater Horizon. For a second, just a second, disbelief gripped them. Flames blazed across the water's surface, jumping 500 feet. And the heat.... People were flailing in the current, hurt, screaming. Others clung to life boats. ""We've got friends that are missing,"" someone shouted. ""Please go search!"" The Deepwater Horizon was enormous, its destruction so vast that the friends had to keep using their binoculars. ""You'd see something floating in the water and we'd go up and try to find out what it was. You know, is it a person?"" Shivers recalled. It would turn out to be debris. The fire was so loud. They worried there was something under the boat. Shivers thought: Is the rig gonna explode some more and send debris our way? Russell stood on the bow, and shouted to a man in a life boat. ""Who's in charge? What do we need to do? We're trying to help. We've got to have some direction."" He got no answer. There was only chaos. The Coast Guard was still not there. Time was compressed. Was it hours later? It was. Crew and supply boats eventually arrived. When their job was done, the fishermen, wordless, exhausted, returned to shore. Months after the explosion, Mead is haunted by what he saw. A veteran deck hand, he had once experienced a fire on a charter boat. By comparison, Deeper Horizon's was like an inferno. ""You don't know the chills that went through me when I heard a Mayday ... a vessel in distress working on the water is bad enough, a Mayday -- that's life and death,"" he said. ""Could we have done more?"" Mead asks himself. ""There's a sense of guilt even though we did all we could."" When he got home after that night -- some 36 or 40 hours later -- he said he needed his wife. She's all he wanted. He fell asleep crying in her arms. Mead, who is now working to clean up the oil, constantly thinks about those frantic hours. He wonders, What if they had chosen to fish closer to the Deepwater Horizon? ""We could have been sitting under that rig,"" Mead said. ""We could have been on the victims' list."" He said he's taking anti-anxiety medications and though he rarely fought with his wife, he says he's gotten short with her lately. Only adding to the stress, Mead said, the BP oil spill has destroyed his charter ship business. All the friends are weary, just as anyone in the Gulf, added Shivers. ""We've gone through Hurricane Ivan, Hurricane Katrina and failing economies, from collapsing real estate markets, and, you know, you've got to deal with this?"" he said. ""How much more do you have to put up with?...It really angers you, it really makes you just sick to your damn stomach."" Even more insulting, the friends say, is that they have not received a reply from BP or Transocean after numerous attempts -- as early as three days after their heroic efforts -- to share what they witnessed with the companies. They have left messages with BP and Transocean's hot lines and claims departments and sent e-mails to the companies, Shivers said. ""'Hey guys, we were there. Can we tell ya what we saw? Can we, you know ... I may have information that can help ya'll out,'"" Shivers said, describing his messages. ""Zero calls. Nothin'. No one's ever called us back."" The men say they plan to sue BP for emotional distress.  BP did not respond to attempts by ""AC360°"" to get a comment for this story. ""You know, those guys out there that night on the ... on the rig...,"" said Russell. ""They thanked us,"" Mead said. The three men who have made their life in the Gulf, who know rig workers, want this: No one should forget the men who were killed that day. ""There's 11 families that I assume don't have a father, don't have a husband..."" said Mead. ""[That's] not supposed to happen when you go to work.""

"(CNN) -- The French National Assembly has just done a huge favor to those elements in the Muslim world that thrive on anti-Westernism. By voting to ban the veil in public places -- a move that brings a draft bill closer to becoming law -- it has transformed a minor social irritant for a section of the French public into a major political issue. In doing so, it is feeding worldwide Muslim resentment against the West almost on par with the occupation of the Palestinian territories and the invasion of Iraq. This act is seen throughout the Muslim world as a deliberate provocation and may bring about equally provocative responses. It is also seen as a clear signal that most French and indeed most Europeans believe that some Islamic social mores, even if practiced only by a very small fringe element of Muslim women, as in this case, are incompatible with European ""values."" It also makes European advocacy of human rights, especially women's rights, ring hollow by making it clear that in this instance it is used in the service of racism. In short, it bears out the ""clash of civilizations"" thesis propagated by the likes of Islamic scholar Bernard Lewis and political scientist Samuel Huntington on the one hand and Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri on the other. The symbolic value of the banning of the veil in France and related attempts to do so in Belgium, Spain, Italy and elsewhere in Europe goes far beyond the immediate impact of such legislation on the lives of a very tiny minority of Muslim women in Europe who choose to cover their faces in public. It comes at a time of increased European antagonism toward Muslim immigrants in their midst, as demonstrated by the increase in popularity of right wing anti-immigrant parties in countries such as the Netherlands and Austria. It also comes in the context of increasing resistance, especially by Germany and France, to Turkey's membership in the European Union. Turkey is predominantly Muslim. Before the French ban proposal, nothing signified Europe's fear of ""Islamic contamination"" more than the obstacles put in the way of Turkey's progress to EU membership, especially when contrasted with the incorporation into the EU of former Soviet satellites with questionable democratic traditions and fragile economies. For most politically conscious Muslims, the ban on the veil and the snail's pace on Turkey's bid for EU membership, have merged into one mammoth display of European bigotry. It is now clear that many, if not most, European elites, especially the leadership in France and Germany, are engaged -- despite their secular protestations -- in protecting ""Christendom"" from both the enemy without (Turkey) and the enemy within (the Muslim immigrants). Everything else, including talk about the rights of Muslim women, is just rhetoric that nobody in the Muslim world takes seriously. I would like to add to this discussion a post-script in the words of the well-known legal philosopher Martha Nussbaum. According to Nussbaum, a prominent argument in favor of banning the veil or the burqa is that it ""symbolizes the objectification of women (that they are being seen as mere objects)."" The ""glaring flaw in the argument is that society is suffused with symbols of male supremacy that treat women as objects. Sex magazines, nude photos, tight jeans -- all these products, arguably, treat women as objects, as do so many aspects of our media culture. And what about the 'degrading prison' of plastic surgery?... Isn't much of this done in order to conform to a male norm of female beauty that casts women as sex objects? Proponents of the burqa-ban do not propose to ban all these objectifying practices."" The obvious answer to Nussbaum's rhetorical question is that none of these latter practices that she lists are remotely connected with Islam. The target of the veil ban is not female objectification and male domination; it is a product of an irrational but visceral fear of Islam and Muslims in Europe: The Muslims are coming, therefore ban the veil and prevent Turkey from entering the EU. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mohammed Ayoob.","Mohammed Ayoob says French plan to ban veils is gift to those that push anti-Westernism .

"(CNN) -- A man and woman suspected of kidnapping a 5-year-old boy from Missouri were arrested Tuesday afternoon in Phoenix, Arizona, an FBI spokesman said. The boy -- Devon Denman -- was found unharmed Monday in the back seat of a stolen vehicle after a high-speed police pursuit in New Mexico ended with Elizabeth Denman and Mark Cochran fleeing when the vehicle's tires were punctured by police stop sticks, according to Lt. Eric Garcia of the New Mexico State Police. Authorities had been searching a 200-mile area around Gallup, New Mexico, west of Albuquerque, for Elizabeth Denman, believed to be the boy's mother, and Cochran, a registered sex offender, Garcia said. The couple were arrested Tuesday without incident at Indian Bend Wash Park in the Phoenix metro area at 12:50 p.m. (3:50 p.m. ET), according to Manuel Johnson, an FBI spokesman in Phoenix. A handgun was also found at the scene of their arrest, Johnson said. During Monday's car chase, several shots were fired at police, according to Garcia. It was not immediately clear how Denman and Cochran traveled to Phoenix -- about 300 miles southwest of Gallup, Johnson said. The couple are being held at the Maricopa County jail pending a court appearance, Johnson said.

"(CNN) -- More than 5,000 people have been arrested and nearly $10 million seized in an operation targeting alleged illegal soccer gambling in Asia during the World Cup, Interpol reported Friday. The international police agency said it coordinated a month-long operation codenamed SOGA III, targeting activities linked to organized crime. Police raided ""800 illegal gambling dens in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The agency said the dens handled more than $155 million worth of bets. ""The results we have seen are impressive, not only in the number of arrests and seizures made across the region in just one month, but in terms of the police cooperation which made this possible,"" said Jean-Michel Louboutin, Interpol's executive director of police services. ""As well as having clear connections to organized crime gangs, illegal soccer gambling is also linked with corruption, money laundering and prostitution, and Operation SOGA III will also have a significant long term impact on these serious offenses as well,"" Louboutin said. The operation ran during the World Cup period from June 11 to July 11. Cars, bank cards, computers and mobile phones were seized, and the information will be reviewed to see whether other people or entities are involved. ""The experience and expertise developed in each of these types of operations provides an even stronger base from which police can work, not only in targeting the organized crime networks behind illegal soccer gambling, but in combating all types of criminal activity which require a regional or international response,"" Louboutin said. Interpol, based in Lyon, France, coordinated the operation with its office in Bangkok, Thailand. Interpol said it was the third of its kind. All totaled, the three separate operations resulted in 7,000 people arrested, $26 million seized and illegal gambling dens that handled more than $2 billion closed. Governments have released details of these latest busts in their respective countries over the month, such as Hong Kong in China. Hong Kong police, which dubbed its local operation ""Crowbeak,"" said on Friday it arrested 235 people, seized $361 million in betting slips, and arrested males and females ranging in age from 16 to 79 years. Hong Kong police worked with their counterparts in Shenzhen and Guangdong to bust two ""significant cross-boundary"" operations. ""Officers of the Police Technology Crime Division are currently examining the computers and server seized during the operations to investigate the identities of bookmakers, agents and punters,"" police said. Punters are people placing bets. Police engaged in an anti-illegal bookmaking efforts and created an anti-illegal bookmaking webpage. ""Illegal bookmakers had used mobile phones and the Internet as platforms for receiving bets. With wider use of the internet and the increasing number of internet users, police believe that more criminals will take advantage of this platform to commit crimes and police will adopt appropriate measures in combating such crimes."" Hong Kong police have started financial probes in order to recover money and cut the incomes of ""criminal gangs."" ""Police also discovered that bookmakers and agents had continued to operate on a number of levels. Agents at lower levels, after receiving bets from punters, had referred bets to bookmakers at higher levels or even official betting companies, so as to reduce their risks or gain commission. Some bookmakers even used others' bank accounts to receive bets and handle crime proceeds in order to cover up their own identities,"" police said. Last month, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported that police in the northeastern city of Shenyang broke an illegal soccer gambling ring ahead of the World Cup.","More than 5,000 people were arrested in Asia .

"Washington (CNN) -- A former State Department analyst was sentenced to life in prison Friday for spying for Cuba for almost 30 years. His wife and partner in spying received a sentence of six years and nine months, but will get credit for more than a year already served. Kendall Myers, 73, pleaded guilty last November to conspiracy to commit espionage and wire fraud. His wife, Gwendolyn Steingraber Myers, 72, admitted to one count of conspiracy to gather and transmit national defense information. Kendall Myers' life sentence does not include the possibility of parole. In a prepared statement, Myers said he and his wife never wanted to harm Americans. ""We wish to add at this time that we acted as we did for 30 years because of our ideals and beliefs,"" he said. ""We did not seek nor receive payment for our work. We did not act out of anger at the United States or from a feeling of anti-Americanism. Nor did we ever intend to hurt any individual Americans. Our overriding objective was to help the Cuban people defend their revolution. We also hoped to forestall conflict between the two countries."" ""We share the dreams and ideals of the Cuban revolution,"" he added. ""We are equally committed to helping the struggling people of the world, whether they are here at home or abroad."" As part of their sentences, the couple also agreed to pay the government more than $1.7 million, a figure matching Kendall Myers' estimated salary over the years while working for the U.S. government and secretly spying for Cuba. The two were arrested in June 2009 after meeting several times with an undercover FBI agent to whom they admitted their activities on behalf of Cuba. Those meetings were captured on video and audio tape. Court documents painted an intriguing picture of a couple motivated by admiration for Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution. They used code names. Kendall Myers was known as Agent 202. Gwendolyn Myers used the names Agent 123 and Agent E-634. They used a shortwave radio to communicate from their District of Columbia home with their Cuban handlers. The couple also admitted they met Cuban agents on overseas trips to various places, including Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador and Argentina. Kendall Myers worked at the State Department's Foreign Service Institute and later at the department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research. He received a ""top secret"" security clearance in 1985. According to court documents, Myers told the undercover FBI agent he usually took information from the State Department by memorizing it or taking notes, and upon occasion he actually took classified documents home. Gwendolyn Myers said she would process the information to be delivered to their Cuban intelligence handlers. At the request of the defense, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton agreed to recommend the Myerses serve their time in facilities near one another to make it easier for family members to visit them. The Bureau of Prisons will make the ultimate decision on that.","Kendall Myers says he never wanted to ""hurt any individual Americans""

"NEW YORK (CNN) --  There is an industry in this country that is making billions in profit while average Americans are struggling to fill up their gas tanks. Glenn Beck says universities should share the wealth from the tax break on their endowments. It's an industry that made an average profit of nearly 17 percent in 2007 while most Americans could barely keep up with inflation. It's an industry whose members paid a grand total of zero dollars in tax on their endowments last year. Are you outraged? Are you ready to call on Congress to investigate or demand that a ""windfall"" tax be placed on these egregious profits? Well put down the phone because the industry I'm talking about is Higher Education. And make no mistake, it is an industry. The top five college and university endowments reported a combined value of over $100 billion at the end of 2007. That's five funds, a hundred billion in cash. Not a nickel in tax. Not an ounce of outrage. Harvard University, which has the largest endowment in the country, has a total of $34.6 billion. To put into perspective just how much money that is, consider that the largest charitable foundation in the world, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has a total endowment of $37.3 billion. But while their financial statements may look similar, their missions aren't. The Gates Foundation is working to cure malaria, develop new tuberculosis vaccines, and stop the spread of AIDS. Most of our colleges and universities are only working to spread the radical political views of some of their professors. Let me be clear: I have absolutely no problem with Harvard or any other school having billions in cash. In fact, good for them! I have no problem with Harvard posting an unbelievable 23 percent rate of return on their money last year. The truth is, I'm jealous of it. I have no problem with the fact that if you project Harvard's endowment out using their historical rate of return they would have over half a TRILLION dollars in 20 years. I don't even have a problem with Harvard not paying one dime of tax on any of that money. What I do have a problem with -- and it's a big one -- is how Harvard spends that money. Or, maybe it would be more accurate to say how Harvard, doesn't spend that money. Schools with large endowments (at least $500 million) reported spending an average of 4.4 percent of their stockpiles in 2007. Meanwhile, those same schools made an average of over 19 percent on their money. But I also have another problem, and that is how these sanctimonious institutions who are so good at complaining about the injustices of our government are nothing but really highly educated hypocrites. For what's been estimated to be about $300 million a year (less than 1 percent of their endowment's value) Harvard could completely waive tuition, room and board for every single one of their students. Instead, they announced an increase in those fees of about 3.5 percent for next year. Being a student at Harvard will now cost a staggering $47,215 a year. Doesn't Harvard know how many millions of Americans are struggling to afford college? Don't they want to pay their fair share and help those who are less fortunate? Some politicians in Massachusetts who can't stand to see so many billions dangling just out of their reach, have proposed a new tax on large university endowments. They don't have a cute name for it yet, so let's call it an ""endowment windfall tax."" Under their proposal, all endowments over a billion dollars would be taxed at 2.5 percent, a rate any wealthy individual or corporation would salivate over. The tax would net the state over $1.4 billion a year, which is a lot of money considering that Boston currently receives about $1.8 million a year from the school. So how did Harvard, which is basically the Exxon-Mobil of higher education (minus the accusations of price-gouging), react to that proposal? In a word, conservatively. ""You'd be taxing success here,"" Kevin Casey, Harvard's associate vice president for government, community and public affairs complained in a quote that will soon be framed and hung in my office. ""Over time, this would put us at a real competitive disadvantage, which would drastically hurt the Commonwealth."" No Kevin, you're looking at it the wrong way. These politicians aren't trying to hurt you, they're just trying to level the playing field. Greater Shrewsbury Liberal Arts Community Technical College for Women down the road is struggling and here you are making billions. If they could just redistribute some of your profits to GSLACTCFW then everybody would be happy. Does anyone else find it ironic that universities overflowing with liberal professors (a 2005 study revealed that 72 percent of professors view themselves that way) embrace conservative values only when it suits them? As a conservative, I don't believe in taxing anyone just because they have a lot of money or are an easy target. That applies to individuals, businesses and universities. I believe that taxing success discourages success, and that's not what America stands for. But I also believe in something else: consistency and accountability. And that's where most of our colleges and universities fail miserably. Besides, Harvard, you're in the wealthiest 1 percent. Isn't it time to help those who are less fortunate? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Beck says he has a problem with how Harvard doesn't spend its money .

"LA CROSSE, Wisconsin (CNN) -- Give Brad Williams a date, and he can usually tell you not only what he was doing but what world events happened that day. He can do this for almost every day of his life. Brad Williams has hyperthymestic syndrome, experts say, and remembers what he did on allmost every day of his life. Williams is one of only three people in the world identified with this off-the-charts autobiographical memory, according to researchers at the University of California-Irvine who gave the condition its name: hyperthymestic syndrome, from the Greek words for excessive (hyper) and remembering (thymesis). Unlike most people whose memories fade with time, much of Williams' life is etched indelibly in his mind. ""It's just there,"" said Williams, 51, who reports the news for a family of radio stations in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The California researchers are studying Williams and the two others with hyperthymestic syndrome, a man in Ohio and woman in California, hoping to gain new insights into how a superior memory works. The goal of the study is to find a way to help people with failing memory. Williams didn't realize how exceptional his memory was until his brother Eric told him about an article published two years ago in the journal Neurocase, describing a woman referred to by the initials, A.J. ""My brother in California saw this and said, 'She sounds like you. Why don't we talk to the folks at Irvine?'"" Williams said. At Irvine, researchers quizzed Williams, as they have the two other hyperthymestics, about a series of dates, asking for the corresponding event, and vice-versa. ""The speed with which they do this is part of why I find this so amazing because it seems to indicate there's no -- or not much -- intentional calculation going on. It's boom, boom, boom, there's the answer,"" said Larry Cahill, a fellow at the university's Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. ""Remember, these are questions they had no idea what we're going to ask them."" Now researchers are using an MRI to create three-dimensional pictures of the hyperthymestic brain. They want to see whether any brain structures differ in size, compared with the average brain. Cahill and his colleagues are still going over the results but it appears some structures in the prefrontal cortex are substantially larger in hyperthymestics. The prefrontal cortex sits at the front of the brain and has been associated with complex thinking, not learning or memory. Cahill said he hoped others with this extraordinary ability will come forward. ""I hope that we can identify as many of these people as possible because the more we identify and the more we study the greater the likelihood that we are going to really figure out fundamental new things about brains and memory that we would have never figured out without them,"" Cahill said. Flipping through a family photo album with him it was astonishing how much Williams recalled, going back decades. Asked about one black and white picture taken in the Badlands of South Dakota, he remembered exactly when it was taken: Tuesday, July 28, 1964, the same day as a trip to Mount Rushmore. He also remembered that the temperature reached 100 degrees and that they tried to keep Funny Face drinks cool in a Thermos in the back of the car. Cahill said Williams and the other hyperthymestics don't do any better than average on standard memory tests, nor are they savants, a condition where one extraordinary mental ability is accompanied by deficits in other areas. In this age of instant information, what can you do with phenomenal recall? ""I don't really know. I've thought about it for years,"" said Williams, the 1969 Wisconsin Spelling Bee champion. Williams appeared on ""Jeopardy!"" but finished second. For now, Williams said he is content knowing research into his memory might help others. ""That would be the ultimate goal."" David S. Martin is a senior producer with CNN Medical News.","Wisconsin man has extraordinary memory known as hyperthymestic syndrome .

"Washington (CNN) --  Some people lose their homes because they have lost their jobs. John Gowan, a Federal air marshal, says he's losing his job because he is losing his home. The Transportation Security Administration this month notified Gowan, 43, that it is firing him because his security clearance was revoked, a direct result of bank foreclosures on his home and two investment properties, and related debts. Federal rules require employees with security clearances to remain solvent -- or to disclose their debts -- so they will be free from the ""potential for coercion,"" or bribes. Aware of the rules, Gowan notified his boss in the spring of 2008 of his financial problems brought on by the real estate collapse and a divorce, he said. He again disclosed his money woes several months later during a routine five-year review of his security clearance, listing the pending foreclosures and other debts. His boss vouched for him, telling investigators that Gowan's disclosure of his money problems would prevent someone from blackmailing him, records show. Gowan and his attorney say they believe the TSA is firing Gowan not because of concerns about his finances, as stated in government documents, but because of lingering doubts or anger agency officials may have about accusations from a former girlfriend, who accused Gowan of breaking into her home and of domestic violence. In February of 2009, Gowan, a supervisor in the air marshal's Orlando field office, went to his former girlfriend's home to retrieve his possessions. He was accompanied by local sheriffs who he had requested to accompany him to serve as witnesses. The girlfriend accused him of unlawfully entering her home and violating an injunction for protection against domestic abuse. The injunction was later dismissed, a judge ruling that there was insufficient evidence against Gowan. Subsequently, the TSA said the allegations were not a factor in the decision to revoke Gowan's security clearance. ""You provided documentation that mitigated the (ex-girlfriend's allegations) to a level that does not adversely affect national security,"" the TSA's Office of Security wrote. But financial concerns did merit the revocation of Gowan's security clearance, the TSA wrote. ""I really think that John's firing comes from a combination of things, and I do believe that a lot initially hinged on the domestic violence allegation that ultimately wasn't proved truthful,"" said John Zielinski, Gowan's attorney. ""Because that (domestic violence) has such a stigma on it, even if it wasn't true, it put John in a negative light. And that has conveyed ever after."" Zielinski said the reason cited by the TSA for Gowan's pending dismissal -- financial concerns -- are meritless, saying they were known by the TSA long ago, but were invoked only after the February 2009 allegations from his ex-girlfriend. Zielinski and Gowan say they are particularly riled by the TSA's findings that Gowan had failed to take actions to mitigate his debts, had taken on new debts, and had increased his mortgage delinquencies. The first two allegations are false, he said. Gowan said he lost $172,000 of his own money on the three properties, spending $70,000 to $80,000 trying to save the two investment properties from foreclosure. He said ""new delinquencies"" cited by TSA had actually been disclosed in 2008, and did not result in his dismissal at the time. As for the ""increased in delinquencies"" cited by the TSA, Gowan said the increase is a direct result of his being placed on unpaid administrative leave. The TSA created a ""Catch-22"" scenario, attorney Zielinski said. As long as Gowan remains suspended without pay, the TSA will be able to show that his delinquent mortgage payments are increasing, he wrote in court documents. ""The agency has helped to create additional delinquencies that now form the basis for its continued revocation of (Gowan's) security status,"" Zielinski wrote. Gowan apparently isn't the only air marshal whose financial problems threatened their jobs, records show. In March of 2009, the TSA issued a policy statement saying that in consideration of the ""current economic climate,"" foreclosures and bankruptcies would not automatically disqualify individuals from working with the TSA. Indeed, Gowan says he has records of seven other air marshals at the Orlando field office who have had their homes foreclosed or have suffered short sales of homes, some after voluntarily taking transfers to or from other TSA offices. But Gowan evidently is the only air marshal who lost his clearance, and is losing his job, because of financial concerns, he said. The TSA declined to discuss Gowan's case, saying it does not comment on personnel matters. Nor would it release information about the number of air marshals who lost their security clearance or jobs for financial reasons. Gowan said he also believes the TSA pressed the case against him because of a confrontation he had with an Orange County sheriff while removing furniture from his girlfriend's house. According to a TSA incident report, Gowan became ""unprofessional"" when told he could not remove any more furniture, twice sticking his hands out toward the deputies and stating ""Go ahead and arrest me, take me to jail!"" Gowan acknowledges that he confronted the sheriff and made the statement, but denied being unprofessional, saying he was ""challenging the position he was taking with regards to the statute or the law."" Gowan says he is appealing his firing, and his attorney said they are contemplating a lawsuit.","An air marshal says he's losing job because of financial problems .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Equipment that the oil company BP was using to help stop the massive oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico is leaking -- another setback for the beleaguered company in its hope of stopping this disaster. The company will need to fix the leak before it can run crucial tests that could show whether an end finally is in sight to the environmental disaster, the company said. There was no timetable for when the leak was to be fixed, a company spokesman said early Thursday morning. Earlier, BP was proceeding with the critical test of its crippled well in the Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. government had told BP Tuesday to proceed with the ""integrity"" test on the well in the Gulf of Mexico, and BP had begun the process of shutting off valves on its new capping stack, to see whether the well can hold the pressure. It's hoped the tests, whenever they begin, will show whether the well can be contained -- either by closing the 30-foot, 75-ton cap stack or siphoning off oil to the surface. That could signal a beginning of an end to the catastrophe that began when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded April 20, killing 11 workers and launching the relentless oil spill. But even if the well is contained, the cleanup could take years. Retired Adm. Thad Allen, who is heading the government's response to the oil spill, announced Wednesday the test had been given a green light, after it was delayed for a day so that procedures could be scrutinized. He said that after intense consultations with Energy Secretary Steven Chu and other scientists involved, ""At this time we'll be releasing an order to BP to proceed with the well integrity test. But we gave them some additional direction to make sure we were are taking due care and in some cases an overabundance of caution, to make sure we didn't do any irreversible harm to the well as we proceed."" Allen said the officials ""sat long and hard about delaying the test"" and it was ""not easy"" to decide to delay. He said they wanted to make sure they're ""getting this right"" for this ""significant event."" Allen added the earlier delay was not prompted by the White House. ""We advised the White House that we decided to take a 24-hour break. It was us advising them that we thought it was the right thing to do. We briefed them,"" he said. BP's Senior Vice President Kent Wells reported shortly after Allen spoke that the middle valve of the three-valve stack had been closed. That's an initial step in the complicated process of closing off the well and checking pressure to see how it's holding. A key question was whether shutting the well was worth the risk, or whether it might damage the well bore. Allen said the test would be a stop-and-go process. It involves incrementally closing three valves on the new cap while testing pressure, a process that could unfold could over two days. Higher pressure readings would mean the leak is being stopped, while lower pressure indications would mean oil is escaping from other parts of the well. It was not clear early Thursday if the new leak was discovered by a lower pressure reading. The massive cap, which has a better seal than the last cap placed on the well, is about three stories high and weighs 160,000 pounds. If the well can't be shut off completely, oil could be diverted through riser pipes to ships on the surface. The Helix Producer and Q4000 currently are at the surface, but it might take several weeks before two more ships can be brought in to contain all the flow. Allen said a four-vessel system could recover up to 80,000 barrels (3.3 million gallons) a day, more than the high-end estimates of the well's flow rate. Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels (1.4 to 2.5 million gallons) of oil have spewed daily from BP's breached well. Wells said the Helix Producer is ramping up production and recovered about 9,200 barrels (386,400 gallons) on Tuesday. The test is called an integrity test because it is aimed at ensuring the well bore has enough integrity to hold the pressure in the well when it is closed. ""In this exercise, high pressure is good,"" Allen said. ""We are looking for somewhere between 8- and 9,000 [pounds per square inch] inside the capping stack, which would indicate to us that the hydrocarbons are being forced up and the well bore's being able to withstand that pressure."" Allen said that if low pressure readings persist for around a six-hour time frame, that could signal problems with the new cap. Meanwhile, two relief wells are seen as the ultimate solution to the oil disaster. They're expected to be completed in August. Wells had said Tuesday that work on the relief wells was being delayed while officials prepared for the integrity test, noting that ""it's a good precaution to take."" But Allen said Wednesday in his briefing the government hasn't ordered BP to halt work on the relief wells. ""They are going very slowly. They haven't stopped,"" he said. He did say that operations on the second relief well were temporarily suspended at a depth of 15,963 feet to ensure there is no interference with the first relief well. The second relief well is a backup to the first. When the relief well does intercept the crippled well, heavy mud and then cement would be pumped in to seal it permanently. Allen cautions that even if the engineering containment efforts work, there is still a lot to be done in a disaster that has affected the environment and the livelihoods of people from Louisiana to Florida. ""There's still a significant amount of oil out there, and the oil recovery and the impacts of this oil will probably extend well into the fall in terms of oil coming ashore, tar balls, beach cleanup, and then we will be ... trying to understand the long-term environmental/ecological impact of the event,"" he said.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Fertility issues were at the center of former TV chef Juan-Carlos Cruz's motivation in the alleged murder-for-hire plot to kill his wife, according to sources close to the couple. The former host of the Food Network's ""Calorie Commando"" was charged Monday with attempted murder and solicitation of murder for allegedly trying to hire homeless men to kill his wife. Two sources close the couple, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, said their 20-year struggle to have a child overwhelmed them. After spending a lot of money on unsuccessful fertility treatments, Cruz's wife, Jennifer Campbell, was ""very depressed and talked about suicide,"" one source said. The sources suggested she may have wanted to end her life but that as a devout Roman Catholic, she believed suicide was a sin. The failure to have a successful pregnancy was ""pretty overwhelming thing in their lives,"" the second source said. The source closest to Campbell said she still loves her husband despite his arrest. The source would not comment on whether she was aware of the alleged planning before his arrest. The source closest to Cruz, 48, said he was ""nothing but a loving and devoted husband."" CNN was unable to talk Cruz or Campbell directly. The prosecution and police would not comment on the case. Cruz, arrested a week ago, remained behind bars pending a $2 million bond payment. A preliminary hearing was set for June 23. The criminal complaint filed Monday accused Cruz of trying to hire David Carrington and David Walters -- homeless men who go by the street names Little Dave and Big Dave -- to murder Campbell. It was not immediately clear who was Little Dave and who was Big Dave. If convicted, Cruz could get life in prison, a prosecution spokeswoman said. Assistant Deputy District Attorney Joseph Marcus would not talk about the case, but the homeless men allegedly solicited to carry out the hit spoke with celebrity news and gossip website TMZ on Saturday. One of them called Cruz ""very meticulous"" but ""very cheap"" in his planning. The plan fell apart when one of the men whom Cruz allegedly recruited told Santa Monica police, Sgt. Jay Trisler said. Trisler confirmed that the men interviewed by TMZ are the chief witnesses against Cruz. Little Dave told TMZ that he was approached first by Cruz, who asked him to kill his wife for cash, and he told his friend Big Dave. Big Dave said he told a Santa Monica police officer about the plot after he was arrested for loitering. ""We're very fortunate that we have a relationship and rapport with some of the homeless and that they were able to give us information,"" Trisler said. Santa Monica police began their undercover investigation of Cruz on May 7, Trisler said. Cruz was arrested at a dog park in the Cheviot Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles on Thursday afternoon, he said. Big Dave and Little Dave got a place to stay while the investigation was under way. Santa Monica police put them in a hotel room to keep them out of sight, Big Dave said. ""They gave us two pizzas, a 12-pack of beer and a bottle of San Jose,"" he said. ""I love them."" Cruz, a Los Angeles resident, was an overweight pastry chef at the Hotel Bel Air until he changed his focus to promote low-calorie recipes. He wrote ""The Juan-Carlos Cruz Calorie Countdown Cookbook: A 5-Week Eating Strategy for Sustainable Weight Loss,"" published in 2007. The Food Network issued a short statement Monday saying Cruz ""has not been under contract or associated with Food Network for a number of years.""","Sources say inability to have child motivated alleged murder plot .

"London, England (CNN) -- Fugitive Raoul Moat, wanted for the shootings of three people in northern England last weekend, died early Saturday after shooting himself, police said. Moat, 37, shot himself around 1:15 a.m. (8:15 p.m. ET Friday), Northumbria Police said. No gunshots were fired by police, and Moat was pronounced dead around 2:20 a.m., they said. A spokeswoman at Newcastle General Hospital confirmed Moat died shortly after arriving there. His death brought to an end a week-long manhunt that had the small northern English town of Rothbury on lockdown and dominated national news headlines. Moat, released from prison last Thursday after serving time for assault, allegedly shot and wounded his former girlfriend and killed her new partner last Saturday. He allegedly shot and wounded a police officer the next day. Convinced Moat was hiding in the area, police launched a manhunt focused around Rothbury and found several sites where they believed he had been sleeping. British news outlets reported police found letters at those sites in which he made rambling threats to police. The large-scale search involved a number of police units across Northumbria in northern England, including specialist search teams, armed response units, helicopters and dog handlers, according to police officials. It came to a head Friday evening when police discovered a man fitting Moat's description near a riverbank around Rothbury, said Chief Superintendent Mark Dennett of the Northumbria police. ""When he was discovered, he was armed,"" Dennett said. ""Expert negotiators were brought in to speak to him, and spoke to him extensively for several hours."" Speaking at a  press conference Saturday, Temporary Chief Constable Sue Sim confirmed Moat had  died after a single gunshot. She said no  shots had been fired by police, but that officers had fired a  taser. ""Right up  until that time police officers were striving to persuade Mr. Moat to give  himself up peacefully. During  this time, officers discharged  a taser. However, this did not prevent his  death,"" she  said. Witnesses described seeing the man, believed to be Moat, with a shotgun-like weapon aimed at his neck while armed police gathered feet away to speak to him. Because police had contact with Moat before he died, the incident has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is standard in such cases, Northumbria Police said. ""While the incident has been brought to a close, we must be mindful of the impact it has had on many lives,"" Sim said. ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those affected."" British news outlets reported Saturday that police had asked for a media blackout during the investigation because Moat had threatened the public. Among the details they were asked to keep secret was the discovery of a four-hour dictaphone recording in which Moat complained about media coverage of the manhunt, shootings, and his private life. He threatened to harm a member of the public -- perhaps journalists -- for every piece of information he perceived to be inaccurate, CNN affiliate ITN reported. Police were concerned that reports could anger Moat and trigger further violence, the Press Association reported. Police also asked for stories already published about his personal life to be removed from news websites, the PA said. They included stories about Moat's mother, Josephine Healey -- who hadn't seen her son in years -- saying he would be ""better off dead,"" the PA said. In messages posted on his Facebook page after his release from prison, Moat said he was upset that his girlfriend was with a new partner, according to British news outlets. ""Just got out the slammer,"" Moat wrote Friday morning, according to Channel 4 News, which said it had been given access to Moat's page. Eleven minutes later, Moat wrote, ""Lost my business. Kids to (social) services. Gonna lose my home and lost my mrs of nearly 6 years to a copper. How did a guy who had it all end up in this situation."" Police later said the man Moat killed -- his ex-girlfriend's partner -- was not a police officer. The most recent pictures police had of Moat were taken on surveillance cameras as he shopped at a building supply store on Friday evening. Moat's ex-girlfriend and the wounded police officer remain in the hospital.","Raoul Moat was wanted in the shooting of three people last weekend .

"(CNN) -- The Utah Department of Workforce Services said Friday it has identified at least two employees believed to be involved in creating a list containing the personal information of a purported 1,300 alleged illegal immigrants. ""At this point we don't think it was a very large conspiracy. We think it was two, maybe. We have suspicion of a couple of more people, a very small group,"" said Kristen Cox, the executive director of the Department of Workforce Services. ""Release of such private, sensitive information is deplorable,"" Gov. Gary Herbert said in a news release. ""We immediately took action to discover the origins of this list, and I'm pleased with the hard work of the Department of Workforce Services. When someone does business with the state of Utah, they deserve to know that their private information will be kept private."" Herbert told CNN's John King on Friday night that the 1,300 people have Hispanic names and not all of them are in the state illegally. The two employees have been placed on administrative leave pending completion of the full investigation and other employees may be identified as the review continues, the news release said. The Utah attorney general's office will review data from the investigation for possible further action. ""The people we've identified certainly have some strong political opinions and seem to be frustrated with some of the issues around immigration,"" Cox said. ""Regardless of what their frustration is, they work for the Department of Workforce Services and for state government. They understand what the rules are. They understand the protocols. And if they want to go rogue, they need to quit the department. I think it's immense hypocrisy to take someone to task for being illegal and doing so by breaking the law."" The state focused on the Utah Department of Workforce Services, Herbert's office said Thursday, because all of the information on the 29-page list -- including contact information, Social Security numbers and pregnancy due dates -- is contained within that agency's database. Information from the investigation may be turned over to state prosecutors, a statement from the office said. The list was anonymously distributed to media and government offices across the state, CNN affiliate KSTU-TV reported. An accompanying letter from ""Concerned Citizens of the United States"" insisted that those on the list should be deported immediately. Thursday, a group of Latino activists told reporters that the list had sparked widespread fear. ""Our community is very concerned, very worried about it,"" said Tony Yapias with Proyecto Latino de Utah. ""I would say they have been terrorized, many of them. People are just afraid of what's happening."" Those named on the list are even more frightened, said Jesus Ramos with the Utah Coalition of La Raza. ""For these 1,300 people, unfortunately that fear has escalated,"" he said. ""There's an arrest warrant out, essentially. That fear never goes away."" Herbert said Friday, ""Some are scared and apprehensive. I understand that. I expect that comes with the status of being illegal. If I was in the country illegally, I would probably have fear and apprehension, too."" Utah Minuteman Project co-chairman Eli Cawley told CNN affiliate KSL-TV that he had some concerns about privacy and how the names were procured, but he would have released a similar list if he could have. ""If it were a reliable list and it had come from a source that was acknowledged and vetted, then yes, I would absolutely support something like that,"" he said. But Herbert said Friday the information shouldn't have gone out to anyone, even the government agency charged with enforcing immigration law. ""It's a violation of federal law to take this information and give it to ICE, whether it's out there or not,"" the governor said, referring to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. ""If we have laws on the books, they need to be enforced and we're enforcing it here on this breach of the law as it appears on disclosing confidential information,"" Herbert said. ""But I also believe the issue at hand, the underlying issue of illegal immigration, is something that needs to be addressed also. We know the frustration of the people out there because of the inaction of the federal government, in particular, in enforcing the law."" Herbert has plans to bring together a ""spectrum"" of viewpoints, some ""diametrically opposed,"" for a roundtable discussion on immigration reform in Utah on Tuesday. ""We see what's happened in Arizona. So Utah, like other states right now, are saying if the federal government is not going to do something, we will take steps to do something ourselves within the parameters of the law. It may mean creating new law,"" he said.","NEW: Governor says some on list may have legal status .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Four thousand women are running for office in Iraq's provincial elections Saturday, and many of them will be guaranteed seats under an electoral quota system. Iraqi women show off their ink-stained fingers after voting Saturday in Baghdad. Regardless of the votes their candidates receive, parties are required to give every third seat to a woman,  according to a report this week from the International Crisis Group. The ultimate share of seats held by women will depend on the distribution of votes among parties, the report said. Some women candidates say these elections -- only the second provincial elections since the fall of Saddam Hussein -- are a chance to improve their standing in Iraqi society. Nibras al-Mamuri is a secular female candidate who argues that fundamentalists have taken over the country. She says it was the 2005 elections that brought them into power and tarnished Islam's image in Iraq. Al-Mamuri, who is running for the Baghdad provincial council, says it's time for a change.  Watch how women are trying to bring change to Iraq » . ""Although a woman's role in the Arab world is mainly that of a mother and child bearer,"" she said, ""I want to prove that women are just as capable as men when it comes to challenging arenas."" At first, al-Mamuri said, she thought just participating in the elections as a woman was enough. But now, she says she is running to win in order to defy men who believe a woman's place is in the home. ""I've entered a battlefield where women have to prove they are competent,"" she said. ""I have to forget about fear."" In recent years, Iraqi women have been targeted by extremists for a variety of reasons -- from not covering their hair to entering the political arena. Under Hussein, Iraq was one of the more secular Arab countries, but the 2003 U.S. invasion unleashed extremist militias. Now, many activists say women have been forced back to the Dark Ages, forced to be submissive, anonymous and fully veiled. Al-Mamuri said she believes Saturday's vote can help women improve their position in society. ""An Iraqi woman can be an equal. She can participate in change,"" she told CNN. The image of a woman posing a public and direct challenge to fundamentalists and their beliefs was not seen in the 2005 vote. ""Iraqi women form the core of society,"" said Rissala Khalid, another female candidate in Baghdad. Passing out her campaign card, Khalid told young women that she will fight for their rights, and told young men that she will try to provide jobs for Iraq's largely unemployed youth.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Encouraged by results so far, BP and the government agreed Saturday to another 24 hours of testing of the recently recapped Gulf well. BP's 48-hour window for pressure testing expired Saturday afternoon with no reports of flowing oil or evidence that the giant sealing cap caused further damage. The testing will now go into Sunday afternoon. Retired Adm. Thad Allen, the government's response manager, said once testing is eventually stopped ""we will immediately return to containment, using the new, tighter sealing cap with both the [vessels] Helix Producer and the Q4000."" Pressure was still rising Saturday though it had slowed considerably as expected, BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said earlier in the day. Officials are looking at the testing in six-hour windows. ""The longer the test goes the more confidence we have in it,"" Wells told reporters in a conference call Saturday. ""There's no evidence we don't have integrity."" Higher pressure means oil is not leaking out from another source in the well. Lower pressure would indicate otherwise. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration sonar ship has been brought in to monitor the sea floor around the well, Allen said in a statement. ""The pressure in the capping stack continues to increase very slowly and we want to continue to monitor this progress."" The latest pressure reading inside the well was 6,745 psi (pounds per square inch), Wells said. That falls short of the optimal 8,000 to 9,000 psi needed in order to conclude without doubt the well is not leaking. ""Based on the data and pressure readings compiled to date, the test has provided us with valuable information which will inform the procedure to kill the well and a better understanding of options for temporary shut-in during a hurricane,"" Allen said. Allen said Friday that the rising pressure readings were generally good news. But he added, ""I think we're at a point where there's enough uncertainty about the meaning of the pressure that we're seeing that we have to use due diligence moving forward. We don't want to do harm or create a situation that cannot be reversed."" Reopening the valves would allow oil to once again flow into the Gulf and recovery operations from the surface to resume. No oil has gushed out since Thursday when BP closed all the valves in a new custom-made cap that was lowered into place earlier in the week. The undersea video images of a quiet ocean sprouted new hope in the hearts of Gulf Coast residents devastated by three months of disaster. Still, they remained cautiously optimistic, as did officials including Allen and President Barack Obama, until BP is able to announce conclusive test results. Engineers and scientists intensified monitoring of the well, pouring over images and data collected by robots, sonar scans and seismic and acoustic examinations. A government ship is in the area, fitted with equipment for detecting methane gas, which would be an indication of a leak. The well integrity test began Thursday after two days of delays, first as government scientists scrutinized testing procedures and then as BP replaced a leaking piece of equipment known as a choke line. The oil stopped gushing out Thursday afternoon, the first time the energy giant has been able to gain control since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded April 20 and triggered the catastrophe. All that was made possible by a new, tightly fitting containment cap. Meanwhile, BP restarted work on drilling two relief wells. Wells said Saturday that the first relief well is now about five feet away from the ruptured Macondo well and an intersection will occur by the end of July. BP then plans to pump mud and cement down to kill the ruptured well. ""We are feeling very good at this point on how the well is lining up,"" Wells said. When they are ready, mud and cement will be pumped into one of the relief wells to permanently seal BP's crippled well. In the coming weeks, BP also plans to bring in two more oil collection ships in addition to the two already in the Gulf, bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels (about 3.4 million gallons) of oil a day, more than high-end estimates of how much oil had been leaking. But it's possible some oil may be released into the Gulf again, before all the ships are ready. The skimming vessel ""A Whale,"" which underwent extensive testing, was found unsuited for the task and will not be deployed, Adm. Paul Zukunft said. President Obama spoke about the developments with a note of caution. ""I think it's important that we don't get ahead of ourselves here,"" he said. ""You know, one of the problems with having this camera down there is that when the oil stops gushing, everybody feels like we're done, and we're not. We won't be done until we actually know that we killed the well and have a permanent solution in place."" The president expects to return to the Gulf Coast in the next few weeks. He took some heat from some corners on Saturday for taking a vacation in Maine instead of heading to revisit oil-affected areas. First Lady Michelle Obama is slated to return to the region Friday to meet with Coast Guard personnel who've been responding to the oil spill and to christen a Coast Guard cutter named in honor of Dorothy Stratton, the service branch's first female commissioned officer.","NEW: Government, BP encouraged by well pressure testing .

"(CNN) -- A Lumpkin, Georgia police officer who repeatedly tasered a 57-year-old woman violated police policy but resigned before he could be fired, a city attorney said Thursday. Lumpkin City Attorney William Nesmith said an internal police investigation revealed former officer Ryan Smith inappropriately tasered Janice Wells earlier this year. The incident, caught on a patrol-car dash-camera tape that was released this week by Wells' attorney, cost Smith and another officer involved their jobs. Wells called police on April 26 because she thought there was a prowler on her property in west Georgia, her attorney, Gary Parker said. Police officer Tim Murphy of the Richland Police Department arrived and found Wells at her home with a guest who had been visiting but was leaving, Parker said. The officer asked for the guest's name, and when Wells declined to give it to the officer, he threatened to arrest her for obstruction of justice, Parker said. The police report of the incident has a slightly different take on the situation. According to the report, officer Murphy was responding to a call regarding an ""unwanted guest"" at Wells' home. When the officer arrived, Wells said that she wanted the guest, a man, to leave her property, according to the report. The cop asked the man to leave, and then asked Wells what his full name was. She declined and he said he would arrest her. What ensued was that Murphy tried unsuccessfully to arrest Wells and called for backup. Smith, of the Lumpkin Police Department, responded and tasered the woman during the incident. Wells was ""peppered sprayed about four times and Tasered 11 to 12 times,"" Parker said. ""You can hear the (stun) gun going off, you can hear her screaming."" ""Don't do that, don't do it!"" Wells can be heard shouting on the dashcam video. On the video, it sounds as though she was stunned about four times. Despite the different versions of what led to the use of the stun gun, the police departments of Richland and Lumpkin were quick to move to discipline both officers. Murphy was fired, Richland County Attorney Tommy Coleman said. Smith, the officer who used the stun gun, resigned and went to another police department before receiving a termination letter written by Lumpkin Police Chief Steven Ogle, authorities said. ""She was a school teacher; she had to teach the next day. She couldn't make bond and she had to spend the night in jail,"" said Stewart County Sheriff Larry Jones. Jones, who knows Wells, arrived at the scene just after the stun gun incident concluded. ""When I arrived, Mrs. Wells was screaming 'I didn't do anything, I didn't do anything.' She was seated in the car and she was screaming 'Larry help me, I hadn't done anything.'"" On the dashcam tape, Wells can be heard yelling as the sheriff described. ""When I saw the tape, I thought, 'This can't be true.' You don't do an animal like this. One time, maybe (with the Taser).

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Another player has entered the immigration battle as the Justice Department sues Arizona over its new immigration law. And the reason the fight is centered in Arizona is that reform has failed in Washington. Like the characters in ""Hot Tub Time Machine,"" reformers are stuck in 1986. That's when Congress passed, and President Reagan signed into law, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which married border control and the legalization of millions of illegal immigrants. Reformers today are misguided to seek a similar ""grand bargain"" on immigration. History shows 1986 was an anomaly, and the desire to get everything for a controversial group typically gets nothing. But there's hope: A few in the movement have begun to see that getting meaningful action will require small steps and ""mini-bargains."" How did we get here? The Immigration Reform and Control Act, the bill resulting from the 1986 grand bargain, proved to be a spectacular failure. Although it legalized 3 million people, the border and enforcement provisions were toothless. By 2009, the  Department of Homeland Security said there were 10.8 million illegal immigrants  in the United States  -- nearly matching the population of Ohio. Reformers today still try to link legalization of the vast majority of resident illegals with stronger enforcement mechanisms -- just as they did in 1986. But the 1986 grand bargain taught today's immigration restrictionists a simple lesson: Don't make any more grand bargains. Many in Congress will not support mass legalization unless the enforcement mechanisms are proven to work. That could take years. Nearly all Republicans and many Democrats will vote against legalization because their most vocal constituents oppose benefits to those they see as morally unworthy. Illegals, they say, violated the law and American sovereignty, put American security at risk and then took American jobs. The way forward out of the stalemate should start the way all policy starts that benefits unpopular groups: Target the most deserving. Modern civil rights policy started small in a 1941 Roosevelt executive order: No discrimination against African-Americans working in defense industries. Big changes start with small steps. Similarly, immigration reformers must start with the strongest claims to legalization: students and soldiers. Hundreds of thousands of kids are undocumented because their parents brought them here. The best students in cities such as Los Angeles, California -- high achieving, polite and outgoing, and as accent-free as any suburban kid -- often turn out to be illegal immigrants. They didn't choose to break any law, but their legal status leaves them with no opportunities. Thousands more young people are willing to fight with the United States military, but cannot. Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, introduced the ""DREAM"" act in 2009 to offer legal status to these young people who were brought here as children and finished college or two years of military service. Starting reform with DREAM would target the most deserving of the undocumented. Supporters of comprehensive reform and legalization worry that the DREAM act will take away the impetus for further reform and benefit only a fraction of the illegal immigrants in the United States. Yet the current strategy has benefited no one. Although it is true that the DREAM act will initially help only a few hundred-thousand, pro-Latino reformers should not forget the lesson of minority rights since the 1940s: Rights expand over time, covering more groups and more issues. After the students and veterans gain legalization, the next step would be their families. Family unification may be another sympathetic cause and political winner. Restrictionists point out that these students and soldiers will always be lawbreakers and should remain excluded. But they need to be reminded that 2006's enforcement-only bill not only failed, but also provoked a firestorm of protest that makes the current demonstrations regarding Arizona's new immigration law look like picnics. Border control and enforcement, like legalization, needs to move forward incrementally and be paired with a scaled-down sweetener: DREAM. Here, then, is the mini-bargain. Supporting the DREAM act is good politics for Republican restrictionists, who need to avoid appearing mean-spirited (which turns off independents) and anti-Latino for their electoral future. Legalization forces can get DREAM, but they must also support increased border enforcement. It is time to try something new. The pursuit of a 1986-style grand bargain is blocking the path of potential patriotic soldiers and is failing good kids -- as well as America's future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John D. Skrentny.","John Skrentny: Immigration reformers must scale back; they can't get everything at once .

"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (CNN) -- Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's boast to have opposed the infamous ""bridge to nowhere"" is a staple of the Alaska governor's stump speech, but her record is more complicated than the one-liner. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin canceled work on the Gravina Island bridge in 2007 after initially supporting the project. She repeated the line Tuesday in Lebanon, Ohio, telling supporters, ""I told Congress, 'Thanks, but no thanks' for that bridge to nowhere up in Alaska. If our state wanted a bridge, we were going to build it ourselves."" But Palin originally supported construction of the bridge, which would have linked the city of Ketchikan with its airport on sparsely populated Gravina Island. ""I'm not going to stand in the way of progress that our congressional delegation -- in the position of strength that they have right now -- they're making those efforts for the state of Alaska to build up our infrastructure,"" Palin said during a debate shortly before her 2006 election as governor. ""I would not get in the way of progress of this project or other projects they're working so hard on."" Her office canceled work on the span in 2007 after it became a symbol of congressional ""pork-barrel"" excess, but kept money that Congress had appropriated for the project, using the funds instead for state transportation projects. Palin hasn't faced reporters since Sen. John McCain tapped her as his running mate. A former aide said Palin turned against the $223 million Gravina Island bridge when the original price nearly doubled.  Watch an ex-aide defend Palin's position on the bridge » . ""It was a different bridge when she was a candidate than the bridge when she became governor,"" Meg Stapleton said. Stapleton said Palin ""knows that we can do it for far less, and she knows the state can handle it."" In a statement announcing the cancellation of the Gravina Island project, Palin complained that public opposition to the bridge ""is based on inaccurate portrayals of the projects here."" ""But we need to focus on what we can do, rather than fight over what has happened,"" she said in the statement. Campaign aides also have had to explain the fine print on another applause line from Palin's stump speech -- that she put the luxury jet her predecessor purchased for state travel up for sale on eBay. Although the jet was for sale on the online auction site, it failed to draw sufficient bids and was later sold at a loss through an ordinary aircraft brokerage. Democrats also are trying to exploit a gap between McCain's famous opposition to congressional earmarks and Palin's efforts to obtain those appropriations for Alaska during her time as governor and as mayor of the Alaskan town of Wasilla. Palin has sought about $450 million in earmarks from the state's congressional delegation since becoming governor, and about $27 million for Wasilla during her second term as mayor from 1998 to 2002, according to state records and documents from the Washington-based watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""All the things that John McCain says [are] bad, she lobbied to get,"" Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential candidate, said Monday. ""When it came to the bridge to nowhere, she was for it until everybody started raising a fuss about it."" Obama added, ""You can't just make stuff up. You can't just recreate yourself, you can't just reinvent yourself. The American people aren't stupid."" The bridge was backed by the senior members of Alaska's congressional delegation -- Rep. Don Young, the former chairman of the House Transportation Committee, and Sen. Ted Stevens. Tom Schatz of Citizens Against Government Waste said Palin gets credit for taking on her fellow Republicans over the issue. ""Anyone who takes on Ted Stevens and Don Young when it comes to transportation is taking on two very powerful interests in Washington,"" Schatz said. Young is fighting to hold the seat he has occupied for more than three decades against Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican challenger Palin supported against the veteran congressman. Stevens, who also is trying to be re-elected this year, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of lying on his Senate ethics disclosure forms and is pushing for a trial before November's election. While Democrats have questioned her campaign claims, some Alaskans see Palin as a modern-day Robin Hood who has returned money to taxpayers. The rising price of oil has bolstered the state's balance sheets, allowing Alaska to sock away $5 billion in savings -- in large part because of an increase in the tax on oil companies that Palin supported. The state's Permanent Fund is now worth more than $35 billion, and Palin approved payments of $3,269 to every Alaska resident this year -- a $1,200 increase in the annual dividend each resident receives. ""She has helped to balance our budget. She has done a very good job,"" Alaskan Kim Brink said. ""She gave, she fought to get us a little bit of extra money in these hard economic times.""  Watch a look at Palin's fiscal priorities » . But state spending has increased under her tenure. And while she has used her line-item veto to cut funds for some government programs, her critics in Alaska complain she has the wrong priorities. ""For a drop in the bucket, every single kid in the state could have health insurance,"" said state Rep. Les Gara, a Democrat from Anchorage. ""For a drop in the bucket, we don't have to be one of the worst states in terms of high school graduation rates."" CNN's Jessica Yellin, Brian Todd and Peter Hamby contributed to this report.","Gov.

"(Mashable.com) -- Microsoft is announcing today that it has integrated Facebook and Windows Live Messenger into Outlook, bringing the streams of millions of Facebook users into inboxes across the world. Last year, Microsoft launched Outlook Social Connector, a plugin that syncs social networking feeds with your Outlook contacts, giving you immediate data on what they are doing and thinking. It started last year with LinkedIn integration, but soon the company announced MySpace and Facebook were coming. Today, Outlook completes the cycle with not only Facebook integration, but support for Windows Live Messenger as well. Not only that, but the company is releasing the plugin for Outlook 2003 and 2007 users as well, bringing Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn and Windows Live Messenger to millions of business and personal inboxes worldwide. Last week, we got a sneak peek at the new Outlook at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Here's what you can expect from the new Facebook integration, as well some features that you can expect in the near future: . Facebook + Outlook = Realtime Contact Data . Facebook and Microsoft worked together to get the launch of Facebook's integration in Outlook Social Connector right. Facebook's Strategic Partner Manager Rick Armbrust told us that they worked closely with the Office team to make the experience more social. One of the things he immediately highlighted was the pulling of Facebook profile pictures into Outlook. The entire experience is a step above the Outlook-LinkedIn integration, which itself was pretty strong. Not only does it pull Facebook profile photos so that you can associate a name to a face, but it pulls the news feeds of your contacts into your inbox. When you're looking at someone's e-mail, you'll also get a glance at their status updates, picture uploads and wall posts, among other activities. When you combine that with LinkedIn, MySpace, Windows Live Messenger, and Outlook data, you get a very detailed history of your interaction with your contacts, as well as an at-a-glance look at their activities and interests. Knowing that a potential client just returned from a trip to Hawaii can be all that you need to have the upper hand against your competition. Microsoft Group Product Manager Paco Contreras told us that there's another new feature to the Facebook integration: realtime updates. Thanks to a new update to the social connector platform, also being released today, updates from your contacts will automatically be pushed to your inbox. There's no need to refresh anything: new Facebook status updates will pop up in realtime within Outlook. The Facebook integration does have limitations, though: except for friend requests, Outlook can only pull data from Facebook. There is no ""liking"" posts or updating your status via Outlook, at least right now. Microsoft says that the next step is to provide a richer social experience by integrating the ability to push data to other social networks, improving the look and feel of Outlook Social Connector, and adding other social networks from other regions. The Social Inbox . Microsoft has known for a while that social technologies are going to dominate the web. That was made evident by its $240 million stake in Facebook and its many partnerships and attempts at social media (some of which have bombed). However, Outlook Social Connector has always felt like one of the company's smarter social media plays. Facebook's Rich Armbrust probably put it best: . ""What's unique is that it's bringing social elements and context from Facebook form your colleagues and your friends into the Outlook experience, which is pretty unique given that there are so many that use Outlook as their primary communiction tool."" E-mail isn't inherently a ""social"" experience (it's not a one-to-many platform), and attempts at integrating social into the inbox (think Google Buzz) have mostly fallen flat. However, social data can be incredibly useful in the business world, especially when you need to understand what your client or colleague is thinking or doing right now. While we'd still love to see Twitter integration in Outlook, Facebook is far larger and, in most cases, has far more useful information. Microsoft's also learned a few lessons from the privacy fiascos Facebook and Google have undergone in recent months. Outlook will only pull data from e-mails connected to Facebook accounts. If your business e-mail isn't linked to your Facebook, your data stream won't appear in Outlook Social Connector. It gives users a choice, although most people do choose to add their work e-mails to Facebook in order to join their company's Facebook network. If you want to learn more about the announcement, Microsoft has also released a short video articulating Outlook's new features. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro appeared on the island's state-run television for the second time in less than a week on Friday, using the forum to again blast U.S. arms policy. ""The Yankees want to offer a world without nuclear arms,"" he said, adding that the United States wants to substitute conventional arms instead. But a world limited to conventional arms would leave the United States in a position of power, he said. The 83-year-old former Cuban leader cited as an example the power of a Trident submarine to launch ""in two minutes"" a missile made of a material stronger than steel that could travel at speeds up to 25,000 kmh (15,000 mph). Once it hits, ""nothing remains,"" he said. ""Everything disappears."" He added, ""These are the conventional arms that remain -- what focus of resistance [could withstand them]? If they use them on strategic locations, nothing remains! That is the world without nuclear arms that they are offering."" Asked about the possibility of a war against Iran, Castro grabbed a sheaf of newspapers from a pile and read aloud headlines warning of dire regional and global consequences. As he sat beside Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, Castro took questions from the dozens of people who had crowded into a room at Cuba's Foreign Ministry in Havana and answered them in the long-winded fashion that is familiar to any Cubans who remember his talks from before an illness sidelined him in 2006. After largely staying away from the cameras for years, former Cuban President Fidel Castro has made five public appearances in less than a week. The elderly Castro attended a dolphin show at Havana's aquarium on Thursday, according to the island's evening newscast and daily state-run newspaper. The state-run newspaper, Granma, showed images of the aging Cuban revolutionary greeting aquarium employees and watching scuba divers interact with dolphins. Photos of the octogenarian at a scientific center were published last Saturday showing his first public appearance since his illness in 2006 forced him to hand the reins of power to his younger brother Raul. Fidel Castro was interviewed on Cuba's evening television newscast on Monday, when he slammed U.S. foreign policy with North Korea and in the Middle East and warned of a potential nuclear war with Iran. He also appeared Tuesday at an economics institute. Friday's latest appearance by the former Cuban leader comes on the heels of the first release of political prisoners to Spain. The group of seven dissidents railed against the Castro brothers and the condition of their imprisonment during a news conference in the Spanish capital on Thursday. The group is among 52 political prisoners expected to be released in coming months, in what would be the largest Cuban prisoner release in more than a decade. They represent roughly one-third of all known political prisoners left on the island and are the remainder of a group of 75 dissidents arrested in March 2003 during a crackdown on government opposition under then-president Fidel Castro. CNN's David Ariosto contributed to this report.","NEW: Fidel Castro accuses U.S. of wanting to replace nukes with super conventional weapons .

"(CNN) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ordered a temporary deployment Friday of National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. The order reflects President Barack Obama's efforts to secure the border, Schwarzenegger's office said. Last month, the governor praised Obama's proposal to deploy 1,200 National Guard personnel along the southwest border of the U.S. Of those troops, 224 would be deployed in California for up to one year. ""The military forces deployed in support of this request will not be employed in a direct law enforcement role,"" Schwarzenegger's order said. The mission is scheduled to end on June 30, 2011. It's not the first time Schwarzenegger issued a general order directing California National Guard personnel to the border. In June 2006, the governor sent troops temporarily to support federal efforts to secure the border. Schwarzenegger's office has said the governor believes more Border Patrol agents are needed to reduce illegal border crossings, human trafficking and the influx of narcotics.","Governor responds to Obama's call for more troops to U.S.-Mexico border .

"(Mental Floss) -- As you will be reminded countless times, when you cast your vote in Tuesday's presidential election, you're not taking part in a nationwide popular vote, but rather helping decide who your state's Electoral College delegates support. Despite its name, the Electoral College never actually convenes as a unified group. There are all sorts of arguments for and against using this system rather than picking a winner based solely on the national popular vote, but for the moment, it looks like the Electoral College will be sticking around for a while. So what do you need to know about the least-fun college this side of the Catholic Church's College of Cardinals? What are the Electoral College's admissions policies? Different states choose their electors in different ways. Some states have nominations for electors during party conventions, while others choose their electors in primaries. In Pennsylvania, the campaigns choose their own electors. The only real things that can disqualify you from being an elector are holding a federal office or having engaged in some sort of insurrection against the U.S. government. Chosen electors are generally loyal party members who can be counted on to cast a ballot that's in line with their state's popular vote. Where's the Electoral College's campus? It doesn't have one. Although the name might make you think that all the electors meet in a centralized location to cast their ballots, the Electoral College never actually convenes as a unified group. Instead, the chosen electors all meet at their respective state capitals on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December to cast their votes. The votes are then counted in a joint session of Congress on January 6. What if no one gets a majority of the Electoral College's votes? If no candidate can grab a majority (currently 270) of the Electoral College's votes, the House of Representatives meets immediately to pick the new president. In this situation, each state's Congressmen get together and pick a candidate among the top three vote getters in the Electoral College balloting. Each state's delegation then casts one vote. This process keeps going on indefinitely until a single candidate receives a majority of the states' votes. The House of Representatives has picked two presidents: Thomas Jefferson in 1800 and John Quincy Adams in 1824. Mental Floss: Adams vs. Jefferson: Birth of negative campaigns . Since electors also ballots for Vice President, the same situation can arise with that office. In these cases, the Senate immediately goes into session to pick a Vice President, although each Senator has his own vote. The Senate votes until a candidate receives a majority of the cast votes. This sort of contingent election has happened just once. In 1836 Martin Van Buren's running mate, Richard M. Johnson needed 148 votes to win the Vice Presidency, but Virginia's electors refused to vote for him. As a result, he ended up stuck with 147 votes, and the Senate had to hold a contingent election, where Johnson cruised by Whig candidate Francis P. Granger. Can the electors change their mind? They can, but they then become what are known as ""faithless electors."" Technically, states make their electors pledge to vote in a certain way, and 24 states have laws that punish electors who decide to get cute and switch things up. However, with a few exceptions like Michigan and Minnesota, votes cast by faithless electors still count in the final tally. Yeah, but that never happens, does it? Faithless electors have actually popped up fairly frequently in American electoral history. One notable instance of faithless electors rearing their head occurred in 1972. Roger MacBride, the treasurer of the Republican Party of Virginia, was a pledged elector for Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew. Instead, he cast his ballot for the Libertarian ticket. While this vote put him firmly on the outs with the state GOP, he became something of a Libertarian folk hero. In fact, Libertarians were so enthused by his vote that he won the party's presidential nomination in the 1976 election. Although most switcheroos don't benefit small-party candidates like this one did, they're not all that uncommon, and not a recent trend, either; Abraham Lincoln's winning total in the 1860 election included four electors who were pledged to Stephen Douglas. Although Ronald Reagan won sound victories in 1980 and 1984, he also received a single electoral vote in 1976. Mike Padden, a faithless elector from Spokane, cast his vote for Reagan instead of Gerald Ford, as he'd pledged. Mental Floss: Brief history of endorsements . It's winner-take-all for each state, right? Yes, for most states, the winner of the popular vote gets all of the state's electors. However, Maine and Nebraska allocate their electors a little differently. Because each seat in Congress is roughly analogous to one vote in the Electoral College, these states let each congressional district pick its own candidate. The state's remaining two electoral votes, which correspond to the state's two Senators, go to whichever candidate wins the popular vote within the state. Technically, this system could result in a state's electoral votes being split between two candidates. In practice, though, all of the districts tend to vote the same way. Although Maine and Nebraska have been using this system since 1972 and 1992, respectively, neither state has ever split its presidential votes. What happens if a president-elect dies? The national election takes place Tuesday, but the Electoral College won't formally meet to cast their votes until December 15. If a candidate dies or becomes otherwise unfit to take office in the interim, a thorny issue pops up. Some states, like Virginia, legally bind their electors to vote for the candidate whose name was on the general election ballot. Other states, though, are more flexible and would allow their electors to vote for the ticket's vice-presidential candidate or other agreed-upon candidate. Luckily, this scenario has never happened with an election winner. In 1872, though, Democrat Horace Greeley died just over three weeks after Ulysses S. Grant thumped him in the election. Because the Electoral College still had to meet to elect Grant, electors who would have voted for Greeley simply spread their 66 votes among other Democratic candidates. As a result, Thomas Andrews Hendricks actually came in second in the election with 42 electoral votes despite not campaigning for the presidency; he was busy successfully running for Governor of Indiana. Three electors actually voted for Greeley even though he was dead, which probably tells you all you need to know about the health of the Democratic Party during Reconstruction.

"(CNN) -- Power outages in Connecticut, rail service disruptions in Washington and warnings to conserve electricity in New York City mark the second day of the Northeast heat wave. As many as 9,000 customers of Connecticut Light and Power in Stamford were without electrical service Tuesday, according to the power company's website. A heat-related transformer failure at a substation in Stamford caused the outage, according to a spokeswoman for the utility company. Temperatures reached 100 Tuesday in Stamford, according to the National Weather Service. In Washington, at least one rail line was delayed when Metrorail officials found a ""heat kink"" on the Red Line. A kink occurs in extremely hot weather when overheated tracks expand but can't be constrained by cross ties or ballast, and when a kink is found, train speed is reduced to ensure passenger safety, Metro said. Track inspectors will continue to monitor all conditions should other tracks become affected. New York  residents -- advised by Con Ed Power to conserve electricity during the heat wave -- did just that, company spokeswoman Joy Faber said. ""No usage records  were broken in the city or  the state,"" she said Tuesday. Earlier in the day at  a media briefing with reporters, a Con Ed official had feared that  Tuesday's usage rate would surpass  the record of 13,141 megawatts set in August of  2006. Faber said later that usage peaked Tuesday -- as New York temperatures hit 103 degrees in some places, according to the National Weather Service -- at 12, 963 megawatts. Even without a record-setting day, residents were still being encouraged to cut back  on electricity consumption, officials said. ""Postpone using  large appliances, turn out lights, use fans instead of air conditioners, or  if you have to use an air  conditioner, set it at 78 (degrees),"" said Con Ed spokesman John Miksad. ""This is a team effort,"" he said. ""We will get through this."" As many as 400 cooling stations have opened in New York's five boroughs, according to the Office of Emergency Management. OEM Commissioner Joe Bruno urged people to utilize the center, and advised neighbors to check on neighbors to make sure they are well. ""This is a significant health emergency as well as a heat emergency,"" Bruno said. The heat wave has claimed one life. A 92-year-old woman was found dead in her home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to the medical examiner's office. The woman, who was found by a neighbor, had opened a few windows in her home but did not have air conditioning, said a medical examiner's spokesman. Heat advisories remain in effect through Wednesday evening for much of the Northeast, according to the National Weather Service, which also issued an additional ""excessive heat warning"" to be in effect until 8 p.m. Wednesday for Philadelphia; Trenton, New Jersey; and parts of Delaware. Weather service officials are advising people to stay indoors as the prolonged heat and humidity creates a ""dangerous situation."" ""Be sure to check on your elderly relatives and neighbors. Coaches, trainers, camp counselors should remain alert for signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke,"" the weather service warned.","NEW: Conservation calls being heeded in New York, Con Ed says .

"(CNN) -- Herb Brooks: On this day in 1980, the former University of Minnesota coach led a hockey team of college kids in a 4-3 victory over the best national team the Soviet Union had ever sent to the Olympics. The squad from the USSR practiced 11 months a year. Brooks was coaching amateurs. According to the International Ice Hockey Federation, ""The Olympic Fieldhouse in Lake Placid, New York, hardly seemed like the place where hockey history could be made, but on one afternoon in 1980, the greatest moment in international hockey took place. It was a moment that transformed the game in one country and, over time, around the world. It was a moment that came to define Olympic success. It was a moment that came to inspire dreams. After February 22, 1980, anything was possible."" On this day 30 years ago, the ""Miracle on Ice"" stunned Olympic fans. In his famous pre-game speech, Brooks inspired his team by saying, ""If we played 'em ten times, they might win nine. But not this game. Not tonight. Tonight, we skate with them. Tonight, we stay with them. And we shut them down because we can! Tonight, WE are the greatest hockey team in the world!"" Two days later, the U.S. team beat Finland and won the gold medal. Brooks died in August 2003, in a car accident in Minnesota. He was 66. In 2004, Kurt Russell portrayed Brooks in ""Miracle,"" the movie based on the victory. And on the 25th anniversary of the showdown, the arena in Lake Placid was named after Herb Brooks. Sunday in Vancouver, Team USA pulled off its biggest Olympic hockey upset since the Miracle on Ice, stunning Canada 5-3 to advance to the quarterfinals. International Ice Hockey Federation: 'Miracle on Ice' is No. 1 story . Ron Paul: The Republican Texas congressman, a stalwart foe of government spending, won a blowout victory Saturday in the annual Conservative Political Action Conference presidential straw poll. With participants naming ""reducing the size of federal government"" as their top issue, the 74-year old libertarian hero captured 31 percent of the 2,400 votes cast in the annual contest. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney finished second with 22 percent of the vote, ending a three-year winning streak at the annual CPAC gathering. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin finished third with 7 percent of the vote, followed by Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty at 6 percent and Indiana Rep. Mike Pence at 5 percent. The announcement of Paul's win, a surprise victory unlikely to have a major impact on the 2012 presidential contest, drew a volley of loud boos from the CPAC audience. According to his official biography, Paul was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, graduated from Duke University School of Medicine, and served as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force during the 1960s. Paul ran for president in 1988 as a Libertarian and in 2008 as a Republican. CNN: Paul surprise winner of CPAC straw poll . Office of Rep. Ron Paul: Biography . Henry Cuellar: The Democratic congressman representing Laredo, Texas, has asked federal officials for a Predator drone aircraft to help protect the border between the United States and Mexico, from Brownsville to El Paso, Texas. The San Antonio Express reports that Cuellar, chair of the House Homeland Security subcommittee, has requested a meeting in April with officials from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Federal Aviation Administration to discuss the possibility of using a drone to fight drug trafficking and possible terrorism threats. Predators are remotely piloted aircraft used for reconnaissance and target acquisition. The Predators used by the U.S. military are armed with Hellfire missiles. The Congressional Research Service says that drones are twice as likely to crash as manned aircraft, the Express reports. Drones have already been approved by Congress for border protection. Each Predator drone costs around $4.5 million. Rep. Cuellar, a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, was elected to Congress in 2005 and is now serving his third term.

Mary Robbins: The 71-year-old retired military nurse from Colorado Springs, Colorado, died of cancer on February 9. KKTV in southern Colorado reports that Robbins had signed a contract in 2006 with a cryonics company to have her head and brain preserved and frozen when she died. She agreed that $50,000 would be paid to Alcor Life Extension Foundation of Scottsdale, Arizona, for the procedure. Her daughter, Darlene Robbins, recently hired an attorney, because she says her mother changed her mind before she died. Attorney Robert Scranton told CNN on Sunday that Mary Robbins ""had a great interest in science and was very forward-thinking."" She thought that she might be brought back to life one day, he said. But in December, the lump she had discovered turned out to be cancer, which had metastasized all over her body. Scranton said she did not want to be revived in that condition. KKTV reports that Eric Bentley, an attorney representing Alcor, says the nonprofit foundation wants to carry out Mary Robbins' wishes. An all-day court hearing is scheduled Friday to decide in what condition Mary Robbins will be buried. Her body is at a funeral home.

There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story. But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in. They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did.

"(CNN) -- A 109,305-acre fire, mostly on the grounds of a U.S. Energy Department facility containing a nuclear fuel development complex, has been fully contained, according to the government's InciWeb fire incident information website. The so-called Jefferson Fire, at the Idaho National Laboratory, about 40 miles west of Idaho Falls, had been burning since Tuesday afternoon, driven by winds up to 45 mph. The cause is still unknown. InciWeb had said as of early Thursday afternoon, the fire was 60 percent contained. Sarah Wheeler, a Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman, confirmed the fire had burned a few hundred acres more while crews contained the final 40 percent of the blaze. ""That's hard to do working 10 miles of fire line,"" she said. The 142 personnel on site planned on patrolling, mopping up and monitoring the situation Friday, the InciWeb site said. About 80 percent of the charred land belongs to the Idaho National Laboratory, an applied engineering lab supporting the Energy Department's missions in nuclear and energy research, science and national defense. During the fire, as a precautionary measure, the lab shut down power to the Materials and Fuels Complex, a nuclear research center, Wheeler said. That power has since been restored, she said.

"(CNN) -- A man was shot and killed Saturday in Oakland, California, during a confrontation with Bay Area Rapid Transit officers and Oakland police, police spokesman Jeff Thomason said. The incident occurred after Oakland police received a call about 8:15 a.m. (11:15 a.m. ET) of an armed man walking toward the Fruitvale BART station, according to Thomason. Police notified BART officers, who also responded. BART officers were the first to reach the suspect, described as a Hispanic male between 30 and 40 years old, Thomason said. The BART officers chased the man from the station to the street, where Oakland police joined in the pursuit over four blocks in the Fruitvale area. Thomason said Oakland police tried to Taser the man twice, but to no effect. The man, armed with two knives, then attempted to charge at one of the officers, a police statement said. Multiple officers opened fire, killing him, the statement said. The man has not yet been identified, Thomason said. The shooting is under investigation by the Oakland police homicide unit, internal affairs and the Alameda County district attorney. ""Anytime there is a loss of life, it is a matter of great concern and sadness for us all,"" Oakland Mayor Ronald Dellums said in a statement. ""It is extremely important that we as a community continue to work together in order to provide a safe and secure environment. Therefore, a thorough investigation of the circumstances surrounding this death has begun."" BART police have also opened a separate, parallel investigation. The incident comes more than a week after a former BART police officer was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the 2009 shooting death of an unarmed black man on a train platform at the Fruitvale station. The January 1, 2009, shooting of 22-year-old Oscar Grant was captured on a bystander's cell-phone video camera. The video was widely circulated on the Internet and on news broadcasts, and it spurred several protests in and around Oakland. The video showed former officer Johannes Mehserle pulling his gun and fatally shooting Grant in the back as another officer knelt on the unarmed man. Mehserle and other Bay Area Rapid Transit police had been called to the Fruitvale station after passengers complained about fights on a train. Officers pulled several men, including Grant, off the train when it arrived at Fruitvale.","Officers were responding to a report of an armed man near the Fruitvale BART station .

"(CNN) -- Police say a Camden, New Jersey, man had the audacity to return to the jail where he posted a $400 bond with counterfeit bills, demanding a refund. Ronald T. White was charged with shoplifting July 7, but his bail was incorrectly written up. When he found out, authorities say, he returned to the Cinnaminson, New Jersey, jail the following week to demand his money back. White appeared in Burlington County Superior Court on Thursday, and this time his bail was set far higher. According to Cinnaminson Police Chief Steven Fowler, the department issued a warrant for White's arrest after his counterfeit bail posting of $400, but because he was a Camden resident, it was out of jurisdiction. Though Camden police were alerted to the claims, they weren't exactly banging down his door. ""Even though it was a $5,000 warrant for his arrest, they have bigger issues over in Camden, being the murder capital of the world,"" Fowler said. White had posted bail using at least two bills bearing identical serial numbers, police say, and the serial numbers also matched those on one of the bills found on him when he returned to the Cinnaminson jail to reclaim his extra $200. Upon further inspection, Fowler said, the counterfeit bills White used to post bail were of poor paper quality, although the printing appeared very accurate. The duplicate serial numbers were the giveaway, he said. ""He was surprised that he was discovered,"" Fowler said. Burlington County prosecutor's office representative Joel Bewley said that because White did not produce the counterfeit bills but merely attempted to purchase goods with them, the official charge was theft by unlawful taking. On Thursday, at White's first appearance in Superior Court, his bail was set at $7,500, because of outstanding charges from Camden County added on to the Burlington County charges. White's case will be presented before a grand jury within six weeks. In the meantime, until he can post bail with legitimate bills, he will be held at Burlington County Jail.","New Jersey police say man used counterfeit money to post $400 bail .

"(CNN) -- Waters were receding Sunday as rescue crews conducted searches in the aftermath of flash flooding in eastern Kentucky that killed at least two people, a top county official said. Pike County Judge-Executive Wayne Rutherford confirmed the two fatalities Sunday, and estimated that 200 homes in the area were damaged or destroyed. Earlier in the day, another Pike County official, Charles Maynard, told CNN that there were three fatalities -- two males and one female. The names and details of the incidents were not immediately released, pending notification of family members. Rutherford said the county will send nine assessment teams Monday to gauge damage so a report could be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for assistance. Several major roads and bridges in in the area were damaged, he said. Crews in Pike County worked throughout the night in boats to rescue people from homes after flash flooding in the area, officials said. ""Raccoon Creek in Pike County is probably the hardest hit,"" Emergency Management Director Doug Tackett said. ""It's pretty much all devastation in that area and I think most of the mobile homes aren't there anymore, and some homes were completely washed away."" Crews started door-to-door searches and welfare checks in the Appalachian county to look for anyone that may be injured or needs to be evacuated, and to make sure families are accounted for, Tackett said. There was no specific number of missing people, Maynard said, but searches in the Raccoon Creek area continued. About 5,000 people were affected, and there were a number of high water rescues and several evacuations, Tackett said. ""I know there were some people taken from cars in swift water, and a few folks were taken from roofs of their homes or from windows to be removed from their homes,"" Tackett said. As the water began to recede, the county faced another problem: One of the major water intake plants in the county was damaged and unusable. ""It looks like about 4,000 customers will be without water for about a week, so we're setting up distribution centers for folk to make sure they have drinking water,"" Tackett said.

"(CNN) -- President Obama and his family leave Friday for a weekend getaway to Maine, but along with a little rest and relaxation comes criticism that the president is taking it easy while oil continues to gush in the Gulf of Mexico. The Obamas plan to spend the weekend on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia National Park. The trip marks the president's third vacation since the oil disaster began in April. The Republican National Convention launched a website blasting what it considers Obama's ""leisure activities or missteps"" during the oil disaster, like playing golf, attending concerts and vacationing in Asheville, North Carolina; Chicago, Illinois; and now Maine. Obama has also faced criticism for scheduling a trip up north, instead of vacationing in the Gulf, as he advised other Americans to do. ""Presidents are certainly entitled to vacation, just like everybody else, but there is a fine line as to when presidents should do it, what they should and where they should do it,"" said Brad Blakeman, a former member of President George W. Bush's senior staff and the deputy assistant for appointments and scheduling. ""Presidents have to be cognizant of the fact that everything they do is going to be scrutinized,"" said Blakeman, who also is a professor for Georgetown University's Semester in Washington program. Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons said the Republican criticism is ""galling,"" considering Bush's frequent trips to Camp David and his home in Crawford, Texas. ""Barack Obama is working as hard as any president that we've had in recent history and certainly harder than the most immediate previous president,"" he said. CBS's Mark Knoller, who keeps track of presidents' comings and goings, calculated that Bush spent all or part of 977 days at Camp David or in Texas during his two terms. Blakeman noted that visits to those locations were working trips and not getaways. Bush's staff would travel with him, and work would continue as usual. The Crawford ranch was known as the ""Western White House"" because of the infrastructure there. As for calls that Obama should vacation in the Gulf, Simmons said, ""Where he chooses to take his days off should really be up to him. We don't want to get into a situation where the president is making familial vacation decisions based upon polling or political maneuvers."" Scott Stanzel, Bush's deputy press secretary who often traveled with the president when he was away from the White House, said that changing locations provided a good opportunity to escape the hustle and bustle of Washington. ""President Bush, on the weekends, would often go to Camp David because the size of the bubble you are in expands, so you can go out for a walk or bike ride without having to arrange security detail,"" he said. Stanzel was in Crawford with Bush for a number of crises that could not have been planned for, like the conviction of Saddam Hussein, the death of President Ford and the assassination of Pakistani politician Benazir Bhutto. Bush was notified of Bhutto's death immediately and delivered a statement to the press pool. ""It would have almost been like we were at the White House in terms of the teams that would convene and talk about the issues surrounding that assassination,"" Stanzel said. The problem for Obama, Stanzel said, is the visuals that could come out of his trip. A picture of Obama playing golf alongside images from the Gulf could send a negative message. Paul Begala, a CNN contributor and former adviser to President Clinton, said that vacationing or not, ""The president is the president wherever he is. ""I thought it was silly when people attacked Bush for going on vacation, so I'll be consistent and say it's silly when people attack President Obama for going on vacation,"" he said. ""Of all of the concerns that Americans may have, they do not need to worry whether President Obama is a hard-working man. They may agree or disagree with his policies, but there is just no doubt that the guy is busting his rear end.""","Obama and family going to Mount Desert Island, Maine, for the weekend .

"(CNN) -- A day after the Federal Elections Commission slapped Joe Biden with a $219,000 fine for spending violations during his failed presidential bid, a spokeswoman for the vice president is calling the ruling ""commonplace."" ""Some repayment is commonplace after presidential campaign audits and the repayment ordered here is relatively small,"" said Biden spokeswoman Elizabeth Alexander. ""Payment is due to the Treasury 30 days after the FEC issues its formal ruling and 'Biden for President' will comply with that."" In a report released Friday, the FEC said a mandatory audit showed the campaign had accepted contributions above the legal limit, failed to adequately pay for rides on a private jet, and issued several checks that had never been cashed. Specifically, the FEC found Biden had not returned more than $106,000 in contributions that exceeded the legal limit of $2,300 per-person for a presidential candidate.The FEC also found the committee had not returned more than $1 million in over-the-limit contributions in ""a timely manner."" The commission report also said the campaign failed to adequately pay for a ride three people received on a private jet between New Hampshire and Iowa in June of 2007 because the campaign reimbursed the owner of the aircraft at a significantly below-market rate. The reimbursement for the flight was based on comparable commercial first-class tickets. But because the plane was designated by the Federal Aviation Administration as a charter aircraft, the campaign underpaid by close to $27,000, the FEC report says. The FEC report also found Biden owes $86,000 as a result of stale-dated checks -- that is, checks that the payees have not cashed. According to the FEC, if the campaign has issued checks that the payees have not cashed within a reasonable time frame, the campaign must reimburse the Treasury for the amount of the outstanding checks. ""Stale dated checks are where someone contributes over the allowed max and campaign sends back refund of overage, but the check is never cashed,"" said a senior administration official in the vice president's office. ""This is common and obviously not in the campaign's control. The excess contributions were less than 1 percent of the money raised; the vendor errors were well under 1 percent -- one half of one percent."" The findings are the result of a mandatory audit because Biden accepted taxpayer money as a result of opting into the public financing system. In all, Biden received $857,189 in taxpayer funds to run his campaign. Biden dropped his bid for president in January 2008 after a fifth place finish in the Iowa caucuses. CNN's Suzanne Malveaux contributed to this report.","Federal Election Commission hits Vice President Biden with $219,000 fine .

"Washington (CNN) -- Unmanned aircraft patrolling the nation's borders have an accident rate seven times greater than general aviation aircraft, and hundreds of times greater than the rate of jetliners, federal officials said Thursday in urging caution in expanding the use of pilotless planes. Unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, have proven remarkably useful in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan, but are difficult to integrate into U.S. skies, the most complex airspace in the world, FAA official Nancy Kalinowski said in testimony before a House Homeland Security subcommittee. Kalinowski said the accident rates for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) aircraft are based on a relatively limited use of the planes -- only 5,688 flight hours. But because of the limited data, ""the FAA must make conservative decisions"" concerning integrating UAVs into U.S. skies, Kalinowski said. It is the FAA's responsibility to ensure the safety of other planes in the sky as well as people on the ground, she said. Increasingly, government agencies, police departments and private businesses have pushed the FAA for expanded use of UAVs. CBP currently operates six UAVs and will get a seventh by the end of the year. The CBP accident rate is 52.7 accidents per 100,000 flight hours, Kalinowski said. The accident rate for general aviation aircraft is 7.11 accidents per 100,000 flight hours, and 0.149 accidents for commercial aircraft. Public operators of UAVs such as the government and universities must obtain a special FAA certificate of waiver or authorization before operating in U.S. civil airspace. Civil users can get permits for research and development, demonstrations and crew training, but commercial UAV operations are not permitted at this time.","Unmanned aircraft have higher accident rates than regular aircraft .

"(CNN) -- Two Minnesota state lawmakers said Friday that they have reached a deal to compensate victims of the Interstate 35 bridge collapse that killed 13 people in Minneapolis last year. Thirteen people were killed and dozens were injured in last year's collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota. State Sen. Ron Latz and state Rep. Ryan Winkler told CNN Radio that the deal totals $38 million and will be presented to the Legislature for approval. Latz said the deal would expedite compensation to victims who chose to take their portion of the settlement and waive their right to sue the state. The plan addresses a key sticking point in negotiations: preserving a state liability cap on awards to individual victims, Latz said. Winkler said victims will be able to collect up to $400,000 and people whose damages exceed $400,000 will be able to pull from a supplemental pool of more than $12 million. ""There are a 182 potential claimants out there,"" Winkler said. ""There were 13 dead, and there were 12 catastrophic injury cases."" Gov. Tim Pawlenty said he would welcome the deal for survivors and relatives if the Legislature approves it. ""I look forward to signing this legislation into law,"" Pawlenty said in a statement. ""It provides needed relief and support for victims and family members directly impacted by the I-35W bridge tragedy. I'm pleased that Senator Latz, Representative Winkler, my office and others were able to work together to craft this legislation."" The bridge collapsed during afternoon rush hour August 1, sending dozens of cars tumbling into the Mississippi River. Photos of the scene showed cars, trucks and a school bus lingering on the bridge's uneven remnants. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating why the bridge collapsed. In January, NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said investigators studying the bridge found that 16 gusset plates, which strengthen the junctions of steel beams, were fractured. The bad gussets were found at eight joints in the main center span. ""When one element began to fail, it's like dominoes falling down,"" Rosenker said. But he emphasized, ""We have not yet determined the probable cause of this accident."" The final report should be ready by the end of the year, he said.

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN)  -- I sat on my friend's couch trying my best not to laugh. He was an associate pastor of the church I was attending, and he had taken it upon himself to introduce me to the ex-gay movement. I was in the early stages of coming out, and let's just say he wasn't very happy for me. On this particular night, my friend and spiritual adviser decided to show me a video featuring the keynote speaker at an ex-gay conference in one final attempt to ""save my soul."" Mission accomplished -- just not in the way he had hoped. That's because when the guy on the tape opened his mouth, I thought Big Gay Al from ""South Park"" had taken the stage. Now normally, I'm not one who generally buys into stereotypes, but when he said he couldn't wait to get home to make love to his wife, I had a difficult time keeping a straight face. Pun intended. It was then I knew it was better for me to join my brethren outside of the closet than soullessly antagonize them from inside, like the dude on TV. Seems like there's always a dude on TV, doesn't it? You know, the anti-gay activist who is secretly involved in an apparent pro-gay activity? Last week, it was discovered a  former board member of the Family Research Council , George Rekers, recently hired a gay male escort to carry his luggage around Europe. The escort says Rekers wanted him to give him erotic massages. (Rekers denies he is gay). But Rekers' story is very similar to that of pastor Ted Haggard, whose story was like Sen. Mark Foley's, whose story was like Gov. Jim McGreevy's, whose story was like ... well, you get the picture. It's as if being anti-gay is the new coming out. When I was younger, I used to jokingly dismiss the salacious ""gotcha"" moments Rekers, who recently resigned from the board of the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, now finds himself in.  But when you consider the political, judicial and economic influence that he and those of his ilk have, and how they use that influence to selfishly impede social progress, derail justice and vilify an entire group of people, you understand why Kirby Dick named his documentary chronicling the double lives of folks like Haggard and Foley ""Outrage."" When you really think about it, anger -- not laughter -- should be the reaction. In the black community, one of the worst things another black person can call you is an Uncle Tom. Based on the 1852 novel ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" the name is given to black people who consciously turn their back on or undermine their own community in an attempt to appease and gain acceptance from the white community. One of my favorite rap groups, Public Enemy, summed it up on their 1991 song ""Nighttrain"" this way: ""Disgracin' the race/ Blowin' up the whole crew /Wit' some of them lookin' /Just like you."" The gay and lesbian community has plenty of Uncle Toms trying to blow us up from inside, but what we don't have is our own word or phrase to identify them. Some call them ""closet cases,"" but there is a difference between someone who is unwilling to live openly and honestly, and someone who takes that a step further and hurts those who do. People in the closet warrant a level of sympathy because we all know how difficult it can be to embrace one's truth. And I do not believe in outing people who are simply living in hiding. But I do believe in revealing the identities of these gay Uncle Toms. People like Rekers, a Baptist minister who was paid to testify against gay adoption and travel the globe preaching that therapy can ""cure"" gay people, do not deserve the same sympathy given to those  who are afraid of losing their jobs. Not when they consciously morph from being victims of homophobia to attack dogs eating their young. Some of my Facebook friends suggested calling folks like Rekers and Foley ""Aunt Anita,"" a play on infamous 1970s anti-gay figurehead Anita Bryant. But she was never accused of soliciting sex from a same-sex police officer in an airport bathroom like Sen. Larry Craig was. A few on Twitter thought ""Uncle Roy"" could work. Roy Cohn was a prominent lawyer who joined Sen. Joseph McCarthy in targeting gays during the Communist scare of the 1950s. Despite being gay himself, he continued to oppose gay rights until his AIDS-related death in 1986. That's a good option, but the truth is, I really do not like linking this viral form of self-hate to warm and fuzzy names like ""Aunt Anita"" and ""Uncle Roy."" I don't want to call them anything that appears cute and harmless, because they are not. And they are more than just late-night punch lines. They are extremely dangerous individuals who are instrumental in the manipulation of religion, the legislating of discrimination and the overturning of equality. Sorry if I don't sound very forgiving, but I've never been big on coddling those who wish to use my neck as a stepladder. I prefer to see them as they are: the enemy within. I hope we all stop laughing at (and covering for) them--and start calling them all out for what they truly are.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, may have killed as many as 17,000 Americans, according to new estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. Though 2,498 confirmed deaths linked to the H1N1 virus had been reported to the CDC as of January 30, the agency estimates that between 8,330 and 17,160 people actually have died from H1N1. The overwhelming majority of the people who died -- between 6,390 and 13,170 -- were 18 to 64 years old, the CDC estimates. Between 880 and 1,810 children 17 years old and younger also died from this flu, according to CDC estimates. In comparison, the CDC says that in a regular flu season, about 36,000 people in the United States die from seasonal flu, with 90 percent of the deaths usually occurring in people age 65 and older. Since this new flu virus emerged in April 2009, health officials have recognized that the reported numbers of people who have been hospitalized and died provide only a partial picture of the full outbreak. Underreporting of influenza cases and deaths is common, especially in the early weeks or months of an outbreak. By mid-July last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) no longer recommended that countries with known H1N1 transmission test everybody who had flulike symptoms, as laboratories were being overwhelmed. Patients were to be diagnosed based on symptoms alone, since nearly all of the circulating flu strains were H1N1. Only severe cases of flu, which lead to hospitalization or death, were to be tested. The CDC adopted these recommendations for the United States, also. Despite the recommendation that deaths suspected to be from H1N1 be tested, the CDC is aware that many are not, and in many cases H1N1 might not have been suspected. The new CDC estimates are based on laboratory-confirmed cases, flu surveillance data and mathematical modeling, CDC spokesman Richard Quartarone told CNN. According to the report released Friday, the CDC estimates an average of 57 million people have been infected with H1N1 and an average 257,000 cases resulted in hospitalizations. Health officials continue to urge people who haven't received a vaccination to do so. ""The real tragedy is that people are still getting sick and we have a vaccine that will help prevent illness,"" Quartarone said.","CDC estimates between 8,330 and 17,160 people have died from H1N1 .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Families of three U.S. hikers detained by Iran submitted a 2,500-signature petition to Tehran's U.N. mission Thursday, appealing for their release ""as soon as possible."" An undated family photo shows Sarah Shourd, one of three U.S. hikers detained in Iran since July 31. Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd and Josh Fattal were detained July 31 after reportedly straying into Iran while hiking in northern Iraq. ""The families, friends and supporters of Shane, Sarah and Josh share the deep hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran will show compassion in this unfortunate case and release them as soon as possible,"" the petition says. It was signed online at freethehikers.org and at vigils held across the nation. Switzerland's ambassador to Iran paid the three a consular visit last month and said they were in good condition, but they have had no direct contact with relatives, the families said in a news release. Switzerland handles U.S. consular matters in Tehran, as the United States and Iran have no diplomatic relations. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran said last month that the Americans entered his country illegally, ""an act that is considered a crime everywhere."" He insisted that he had no control over the case. ""The judiciary handles these cases. The judiciary in Iran is completely independent and no one can interfere with the process of the law and work of the judge,"" he told The Associated Press. However, he added, ""what I can ask is that the judiciary expedite the process and give it its full attention ... and basically look at the case with maximum leniency."" Relatives of the hikers expressed gratitude for those comments. ""President Ahmadinejad said he sympathizes with our plight, and we appreciate that,"" said Cindy Hickey, the mother of Shane Bauer and a spokeswoman for the families.

"(CNN) -- Han Han is China's rebel writer who has become the unofficial voice for his generation. As a teenager the 27-year-old began writing novels about angst-ridden characters that proved tremendously popular with China's angsty youth. But it is his blog that has propelled him to celebrity status in China and earned him the accolade as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people of 2009. He's been touted as mouthpiece for the ""post-80's generation""; China's youth who have grown up during the country's economic boom and are often characterized as apolitical and consumer-obsessed. Blogging about issues such as the Chinese government's handling of the Sichuan earthquake of 2008 and recent spate of school stabbings, Han Han is savvy enough to know the limits of what he can and can't write about. ""Even though the Chinese government has improved on the freedom of speech front in recent years, writing is still rather dangerous, so it's quite difficult to strike this balance,"" he told CNN. ""But I believe you still need to try despite these difficulties. The situation only improves when there are more people trying; if no one is trying, it only gets more and more difficult."" With boyish good-looks and a rebel's cred (he dropped out of high-school and races rally cars) he's become one of China's more popular and recognizable bloggers, where the Internet is an increasingly popular forum for self-expression. For Jeremy Goldkorn, a China media commentator, Han's attitude combined with his writing helps strike a chord with millions of China's disaffected youth. ""What separates Han Han from the other popular bloggers is, I think... he's got attitude. He is provocative and he reflects some of the anxieties that young people feel about the way China is today,"" said Goldkorn. He may be outspoken but Han is not an activist in the vein of human rights and freedom of speech campaigner Liu Xiabao, who was jailed in 2009. Coming from a different generation from Han sees himself more aligned with artists rather than political iconoclasts. ""I'm not asking or requesting much -- I just hope that all the people in arts, all the literati, painters, and directors can work in an unregulated and uncensored environment,"" he said. ""But to be honest, the Chinese government and Chinese officials aren't as scary or as evil as what outsiders perceive. Their thinking process is a bit old-fashioned and stupid, but not evil. Except towards people who they believe might threaten the government, of course this relates mostly to many political events in the past.""","Han Han is an outspoken blogger who has gained celebrity status .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- In the early 1990's, I was listening to the Rush Limbaugh radio show when a young man from Youngstown, Ohio, called in to complain about... well, life. The caller was upset that, since the steel mills had closed years earlier, there was no opportunity for him in his beloved hometown. Youngstown was where his father and grandfather had raised families and where he had hoped to raise his own. So he was attracted to the protectionist rhetoric of presidential candidates promising to erect trade barriers in the hopes of resurrecting U.S. cities. But, short of attending a political rally, the young man from Youngstown didn't know what to do. Noting that our most daunting obstacles are often self-imposed, Limbaugh gave the caller some simple but valuable advice: ""Move!"" Brilliant. But moving isn't always easy. At various moments, some of us have felt inextricably bound to our hometowns by a loyalty that defies logic. That can be charming. Yet, especially in a sour economy, it can also be self-defeating. Now I read about a new trend: More and more Americans are responding to the wobbly U.S. economy by fleeing the country. It seems that when the U.S. job market gets tough, the desperate get going -- to wherever the jobs happen to be. According to a recent article in USA Today, with the nation's unemployment rate at a 26-year-high of 10.2 percent, many Americans are looking for jobs outside the country. In fact, U.S.-based staffing companies and executive search firms say that the job outlook abroad looks brighter than it does here. The most welcoming job markets: India, China, Dubai, Brazil, and Singapore. The jobs that are most often taking people abroad: engineering, management or consulting. As the article points out, a survey by Korn/Ferry found that 54 percent of executives said they'd be either likely or highly likely to accept a post in a foreign country. Four years ago, in better times, it was just 37 percent. At MIT's Sloan School of Management, 24 percent of 2009 graduates found jobs overseas, a jump from 19 percent last year. Sure, leaving the United States is an extreme measure. I'd be happy if most Americans were more willing to just leave their comfort zone. If you're unemployed, the secret to survival is to know where to go -- and where to steer clear of. According to one set of job growth projections, in 2010 the three most promising states will be Idaho, Colorado and Texas -- with Wyoming, Washington, and New Mexico not far behind. The three least promising will be Nevada, Florida, and West Virginia -- with California, Illinois, and New York not much better off. For me, this subject hits close to home. No pun intended. You see, I was once just like the guy from Youngstown. I was in love with a hometown (Sanger, a small town in central California) that couldn't sustain my ambition. After graduating from college on the East Coast, I rushed home. Eventually, reality set in and I spent my 20s bouncing back and forth to Los Angeles, a much larger market, for one job or another. Finally, when I turned 30, I said goodbye to California and took my first reporting job at a newspaper in Arizona. Then I kept moving. I moved four times in my 30s -- from Sanger to Phoenix to Boston to Dallas to San Diego. The lesson I learned along the way: Jobs don't just come to you. More often, you have to go to the job. Too many Americans resist that truth and instead wait for their dream jobs to come knocking at their door. They treat the idea of living in a certain city or state as an entitlement that they're not willing to surrender. A few months ago, I found myself having lunch next to a middle-aged man who told me that, when he was starting his business, he had moved all around the country until he arrived at what he considered the destination city of La Jolla, California -- north of San Diego. He was frustrated because his son, who had grown up in that ritzy ZIP code, was now in his early 20s and considered it his birthright to keep living there. Shaking his head, the man said: ""He doesn't understand that I had to work my whole life to get here, and that he has to move to a more affordable city and work his way back."" Multiply that story by 10 million, and you get a sense for what we're up against. Here again, the native-born could learn from immigrants, foreign students, and anyone else who has the moxie to leave behind family, friends, and the familiar in search of a better life. Those people may struggle, but they'll survive and get ahead. It has always been this way. And in a global economy, this is how it will remain for as far as the eye can see. The sooner Americans accept that, the better off they'll be. The better off we'll all be.

"(CNN) -- British media have leapt to the defense of beleaguered BP following attacks by the White House over its handling of the Gulf Coast disaster. President Barack Obama has taken a tough stance against the company and its response to the April 20 explosion, which killed 11 workers and has spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf, threatening livelihoods and wildlife.  But now UK opinion formers have weighed in, attacking Obama's approach, warning of the threat to pension funds and questioning relations with the United States. Barack Obama, David Cameron, to discuss BP . Cameron is told to ""stand up for your country"" by the Daily Mail, which backed the Conservative leader at last month's UK election. It points out while ""British marines continue to die in Afghanistan -- fighting valiantly alongside their American colleagues,"" relations between the respective leaders means the phrase ""special relationship"" sounds increasingly hollow. In a leader column the newspaper says Obama's attacks are ""rank hypocrisy,"" coming only weeks after the president advocated deepwater drilling. Elsewhere it highlights oil disasters off the UK coast involving U.S. companies, including the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion of 1988, in which 167 people died. The Lex column in The Financial Times says that the manner in which the crisis is ""moving into the diplomatic sphere is surely a positive for BP -- providing a much needed counterweight to Mr Obama's swinging boot."" Meanwhile Philip Stephens, also writing in the same paper under the headline ""Some home truths for a president showing the strain"", says that ""Deepwater is only there because the U.S., with a twentieth of the world's population, consumes one-quarter of world oil."" The leader opinion in The Daily Telegraph points out that BP is a multinational company, 40 percent of whose shareholders are American. ""The long-term relationship between Britain and America should not be jeopardized by a presidential response that has been more petulant than statesmanlike,"" it continues. The Telegraph says it is disappointed that Obama, ""a politician whose reputation was built on his powers of persuasion should be so quick to inflame a difficult situation for his own political ends. We had thought better of him."" Obama is told to ""stop ranting against  BP"" by the Daily Express, which leads with the headline: ""Obama is killing all our pensions."" Many British retirement funds, both public and private, invest in the oil company, which has seen billions wiped off its share price this week. ""Nobody disputes that an environmental catastrophe has taken place,"" the Express says. ""But BP is only one of three major companies involved. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that it is being persecuted because its first initial stands for 'British' and Britain should not put up with that."" Malcolm Rifkind, foreign minister under the last Conservative government, asks in The Times whether ""the great British love-in with Barack Obama may be coming to an end."" ""While there has been deep understanding of the environmental catastrophe that has struck the United States and of BP's responsibility, there is also growing concern that the President's angry rhetoric is going over the top and risks dividing the United States and the United Kingdom. ""Mr Obama must understand,"" continues Rifkind, ""that an American president does not just have a domestic audience. Whatever their political purpose for his own electorate, his words resonate throughout the world and, however unintended, can have serious and damaging consequences."" In The London Evening Standard Chris Blackhurst wrote: ""There are three words to be thrown back at President Obama: Bhopal and Agent Orange. In both instances, the U.S. inflicted huge suffering on others -- and did precious little to remove the toxic pollution it left behind."" Nearly 4,000 died in the Indian city of Bhopal in 1984 following the escape of lethal methyl isocyanate at a plant owned by Union Carbide India Limited -- the now-defunct local subsidiary of the American chemical company. Agent Orange was used as a defoliant during the Vietnam War -- but its toxins have been linked to thousands of deaths and illnesses. ""BP has not called itself British Petroleum for more than 10 years,"" adds Blackhurst. ""It's not the only one to not use its full name. Barack Hussein Obama is another.""","UK media and politicians have criticized attitude of U.S. politicians toward BP .

"(CNN) -- Budget airline Ryanair faces an investigation from the UK's consumer and competition authority following allegations of misleading and unfair advertising. Ryanair has complained to OFT about its ongoing row with the UK's Advertising Standards Authority. British advertising watchdog the Advertising Standards Authority has referred Europe's leading low-cost carrier to the Office of Fair Trading after it failed to act on a series of previous warnings over code breaches. ASA had found the Irish airline guilty of seven transgressions in a two-year period, it said on its Web site. It said Ryanair had exaggerated claims about the availability of flights at advertised prices, and it advertised prices that did not include taxes and charges. The ASA was also unhappy with Ryanair's ""misleading"" comparisons with competitors, and that it did not display restrictions that would exclude customers from taking up an offer or provide evidence to prove the claims it was making. ""It is very disappointing, but absolutely necessary, that we have had to take this course of action,"" said ASA director general Christopher Graham, whose authority last referred a company to OFT in 2005. ""The ASA has given Ryanair every opportunity to put its house in order and ensure that its advertising adheres to the codes. Instead, they have continued to mislead consumers and denigrate competitors. ""We would prefer to work with advertisers within the self-regulatory system rather than call in a statutory body, but Ryanair's approach has left us with no option but to refer them to the OFT who will consider appropriate action."" Last week, Ryanair complained to OFT about its treatment by the ASA. It said in a statement on its Web site that the ASA had ""demonstrated a repeated lack of independence, impartiality or fairness where Ryanair is concerned by making factually inaccurate and untrue findings in response (in some cases) to totally baseless and unsubstantiated alleged complaints."" Ryanair's Peter Sherrard said the ASA had ""clearly confirmed its bias and blind determination to rule against Ryanair's adverts."" In February, Ryanair had to shut down its Web site and call centers for three days while it upgraded its reservations system. The airline said the move was necessary to make technical changes as it converts to a new system, but OFT indicated at the time that the shutdown was due to Ryanair's failure to meet a deadline to list all fares on the site. A Ryanair spokesman said the airline was not forced by the OFT to shut down its system as a punitive measure. He said the Web site already complied with OFT requirements and simply required an updated system. The OFT said it took action last year against 13 airlines that did not include ""fixed non-optional costs"" in prices on their Web sites. It said 11 airlines amended their sites to make those fees clear, but Ryanair and Ireland's Aer Lingus asked for extra time. Aer Lingus met the new deadline, the OFT said, but Ryanair did not. Ryanair has previously been in trouble over adverts, including one depicting French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni before their wedding, and another showing a scantily-clad schoolgirl.

"(CNN) -- President Obama is facing great challenges as he takes office and may have made a hasty decision to close Guantanamo Bay without addressing all of the repercussions, Sen. John McCain told CNN's Larry King Thursday night. Sen. John McCain says he thinks President Obama should have considered where Guantamao prisoners will go. ""When Franklin Delano Roosevelt came to the presidency, it was economic challenges. We clearly faced the rise of Hitler and fascism, but early on it was mainly domestic issues,"" McCain said. But President Obama has in front of him two wars, a crisis in the Middle East and a domestic economic crisis. ""This president faces domestic challenges and the national security challenges, so he's got a big job,"" McCain said. Obama got to work from day one by ordering a halt to prosecutions of Guantanamo Bay prisoners, followed by an order to close the detention facility within a year and ban torture. But McCain told King he thinks the new president may have been hasty in the decision and should have taken the time to consider everything associated with closing the camp before forcing himself into a timetable. ""I think that it's a wise move,"" McCain said about closing Guantanamo Bay. ""But I also think that we should have addressed this whole issue completely, because it did not address the issue of those who we have in custody and can't -- and no country will take them back. We should have addressed the issue of those who we know would pose a threat to the United States, but we don't have sufficient evidence to move forward.""  Watch McCain talk about the problem with closing Guantanamo Bay » . McCain said instead of closing Guantanamo Bay outright, he would have first continued the military commissions, which ""after years of delay and obfuscation"" were finally moving toward trials. ""So, the easy part, in all due respect, is to say we're going to close Guantanamo,"" McCain said. ""Then I think I would have said where they were going to be taken. Because you're going to run into a NIMBY [not in my backyard] problem here in the United States of America."" Along with the order to close Guantanamo, Obama also set up a task force to advise him on strategies to relocate its prisioners. McCain also expressed concerns over President Obama's proposed stimulus package, saying from where he stands, it ""is more of a spending package than a stimulus package."" ""I hope we can work together to, frankly, be a real stimulus package and not just a spending package that has every cat and dog and pet project that people have,"" he said. ""Because the object of a stimulus package is to stimulate the economy, not to just spend more and run up the debt to our kids and our grandkids."" In addition to a real stimulus package, McCain said he believes the government should work to cut or eliminate payroll taxes. ""I think we should spend the money that we can immediately, but at the same time if we have a couple of quarters of positive GDP growth, then let's start reducing and eliminating the huge, massive, unprecedented deficits that are going to accrue from these actions,"" he said. Despite some of their differing viewpoints on how to tackle the biggest problems the president will handle, McCain said he does plan to work with President Obama in any way he can.  Watch McCain talk about working with Obama » . ""These are difficult times and whatever way I can assist and work with the president of the United States, I want to do it,"" he said. ""And again, the American people are tired of the bitter partisanship.""

The American people are demanding it and they deserve it and they haven't been getting it.""","McCain: Closing Guantanamo ""wise move,"" but incomplete solution .

"(CNN)  -- James von Brunn, who was accused of killing a security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in June, died Wednesday morning at a hospital in North Carolina, his attorney said. ""He was just very sick,"" public defender A.J. Kramer said. ""It is a sad end to a very sad occurrence."" Von Brunn, 89, a self-avowed white supremacist, was a known Holocaust denier who created an anti-Semitic Web site called ""The Holy Western Empire."" Kramer said officials from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons transferred von Brunn to an undisclosed hospital, apparently realizing his condition was worsening. Before being moved, von Brunn was undergoing mental competency tests at a prison facility in Butner, North Carolina. The cause of death wasn't immediately known. A federal grand jury indicted von Brunn in July on murder charges in the death of Stephen Tyrone Johns, a six-year veteran of the museum's security staff, the Justice Department said. Von Brunn, of Annapolis, Maryland, faced a seven-count indictment in the June 10 attack. Four of the counts could have made him eligible for the death penalty. He also was charged with gun violations and hate crimes. Officers at the museum returned fire and shot him, and he was hospitalized. In July, against his will, von Brunn was ordered to undergo psychiatric testing. He ignored the advice of the judge and his defense attorney and addressed the court during a hearing to fight any delays. ""Your Constitution guarantees me a speedy and fair trial,"" he said from his wheelchair to U.S. District Judge Reginald Walton. Von Brunn repeatedly claimed ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" a widely read book about a teenage girl's experiences under Nazi rule, was a hoax. The museum shooting occurred on a day the museum was to stage a play based on Anne Frank and two days before what would have been her 80th birthday. Investigators found a notebook in the suspect's car listing other locations in Washington, a federal official told CNN. It was unclear what purpose the list served. Von Brunn is accused of entering the museum in the afternoon and shooting Johns with a rifle, said Chief Cathy Lanier of the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department. Two other security guards returned fire, according to Lanier and a museum statement. Both Johns and von Brunn were taken to George Washington University Hospital, said D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty. Johns died at the hospital. Johns, 40, was a resident of Temple Hills, Maryland, according to a statement issued by Wackenhut Services Inc., which has provided security services at the museum since 2002.

"(CNN)  -- A former Harvard University student, who compiled world-class academic credentials by allegedly fabricating his own history and plagiarizing others' work, pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him Tuesday, according to a Massachusetts prosecutor. At his arraignment in Woburn, Massachusetts, Adam Wheeler, 23, entered his plea against the 20 counts he faces, including larceny, identity fraud, falsifying an endorsement or approval and pretending to hold a degree, according to Middlesex County District Attorney Gerry Leone. In a statement, Leone said Wheeler, of Delaware, is accused of falsifying transcripts that detailed an outstanding academic career at some of Massachusetts' finest institutions. He was exposed after submitting applications and references for the Rhodes and Fulbright scholarships while a student at Harvard University in 2009, according to Leone. A Harvard professor reviewing Wheeler's application for one of the scholarships noticed similarities between Wheeler's work and that of another professor. After comparing both pieces of work, the professor determined that Wheeler had plagiarized most of his application packet, Leone said. The university launched an internal investigation and began to look into Wheeler's file. University officials discovered that Wheeler had fabricated recommendations from Harvard professors, college transcripts reflecting perfect grades and a résumé listing numerous books he had co-authored, lectures he had given and courses he had taught, according to the release. While he was at Harvard, Wheeler won the university's Winthrop Sargent Prize in English and the Hoopes Prize for outstanding scholarly work, as well as a research grant, all with plagiarized submissions, Leone said. ""Not only was this defendant untruthful on his application to the University and his numerous scholarship applications, he is also alleged to have stolen over $45,000 in grants, scholarship and financial aid money awarded to him on applications and submissions of documents that were based on lies and reproductions of other people's hard work,"" Leone said. Officials also discovered that Wheeler also had submitted false SAT scores and had fabricated transcripts from both the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Phillips Academy in Andover, although he never attended either school, the prosecutor said. Harvard officials also found that Wheeler had previously attended Bowdoin College in Maine, where he was suspended due to academic dishonesty, according to Leone. In January, after leaving Harvard, Wheeler applied for an internship at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, ""stating that [he] was taking the spring semester off from Harvard to work on two scholarly books,"" Leone said in the release. Wheeler was turned down by the hospital after a background check revealed he had falsified documents, Leone said. At the same time, Wheeler also submitted transfer applications to both Yale and Brown universities, claiming to be an intern at McLean Hospital, according to the prosecutor.","NEW: Ex-Harvard student pleads not guilty to 20 counts in fraud, plagiarism case .

"Susan Craig's brother Roger died of a pulmonary embolism in 2007, at age 38. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder in high school, he had been on antipsychotic drugs for years. At the time of his death, he was carrying 280 pounds on his 6-foot-4-inch frame. Craig, a public relations specialist who works at Columbia University in New York City, knew that Roger's medications could cause weight gain. But she had never been told that the drugs he was taking might be harming his heart. ""We were never counseled by his psychiatrist or his primary care provider to watch for symptoms of heart disease or any risk of sudden death at all,"" Craig says. There's no evidence that Roger's medications caused his death, but his family might have been able to get him help sooner if they had known about the risks, Craig explains. New research published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that antipsychotic drugs are not risk free, and the study's authors are urging much more caution in their use. The drugs are associated with a risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly at higher doses. Health.com 10 best foods for your heart . Craig's brother was taking haloperidol, which belongs to an older class of drugs called typical antipsychotics, which have long been known to increase the risk of sudden death due to cardiac causes. He was also on risperidone, a member of a newer class of drugs called atypical antipsychotics, which had been considered safer. Doctors prescribe these newer medications, originally developed to treat schizophrenia, for a wide variety of problems -- from conduct disorder in kids to aggressive behavior in Alzheimer's patients. In fact, they've become so popular that three of them -- olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine -- are among the 10 top-selling drugs worldwide, with $14.5 billion in sales in 2007. The new study suggests that among patients taking high doses of atypical antipsychotics, there are about 3.3 cases of sudden cardiac death per 1,000 patients per year, which an editorial characterizes as a risk that's ""between 'moderate' and 'low,' but not 'rare.'"" Health.com: Heart drug may be a cancer fighter . About 325,000 people in the United States each year die of sudden cardiac death, which has an incidence of 0.1 to 0.2 percent per year in adults. ""[The drugs] have potentially very serious side effects,"" says Wayne A. Ray, Ph.D., the director of the division of pharmacoepidemiology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, in Nashville. ""So whenever a decision is made to use one, consideration of potential side effects needs to be made."" Ray and his colleagues found that atypical antipsychotics doubled the risk of sudden death from heart-related causes, most likely by causing disturbances in heart rhythms. First introduced in the mid-nineties, atypical antipsychotics were praised for having none of the troublesome side effects of their predecessors, including frequent, involuntary movements of the face and mouth that were in some cases irreversible. But the new study shows that the increased risk of sudden cardiac death seen with the older drugs is nearly identical to that of the newer medications. There had been suspicions that the drugs were risky, especially when used in older patients, but the current study is the first to systematically investigate their association with sudden cardiac death. Ray and his colleagues reviewed data on Tennessee Medicaid patients, comparing 44,218 people using older typical antipsychotics and 46,089 taking the newer atypical antipsychotics to 186,600 people who had never used the drugs. People with schizophrenia may have a higher rate of cardiac problems, due to smoking and other factors. To account for this, researchers also compared antipsychotic drug users without schizophrenia to non-drug users who had characteristics (in most cases, mood disorders) that made them likely candidates for the drugs. Overall, people taking typical antipsychotics were at 1.99-times greater risk of sudden cardiac death, while the risk for those on atypical antipsychotics was increased 2.26 times. The increased risk was greater for people on higher doses of the drugs. People who had used the drugs in the past but stopped weren't at greater risk of sudden cardiac death. ""The drugs are still very effective for conditions that there's proven evidence for,"" says Jeffrey A. Lieberman, M.D., a professor and chair of psychiatry at Columbia University, in New York City, and the director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, who was not involved with Ray's research. ""They clearly need to still be able to be used. I think this [study] really underscores the need to be very judicious about how these medications are used and whom they're given to."" While atypical antipsychotics have been used to ease aggressive behavior for patients with Alzheimer's disease, for example, they are not approved for this purpose by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; in fact, in 2005, the FDA issued a warning that these drugs increased the risk of death among elderly people, extending the warning to all antipsychotic drugs last year, notes Sebastian Schneeweiss, M.D., Sc.D., an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, in Boston, who coauthored an editorial accompanying the current study. Health.com: How is depression in the elderly different from dementia? Given the lack of better alternatives, these drugs are still widely used in patients with dementia despite the warnings, he adds. But while there's anecdotal evidence that they will ""cool these patients down"" and reduce their aggressive behaviors, there's no scientific evidence that they really help patients or their caregivers, Dr. Schneeweiss says. In his editorial, Dr. Schneeweiss and coauthor Jerry Avorn, M.D., also of Harvard, call for patients to undergo an electrocardiogram before and shortly after being placed on atypical antipsychotics, to determine if the drugs are causing any heart rhythm disturbances. For people who must be on these medications, Ray says, it's essential for their doctors to treat any other conditions, such as high blood pressure, that can harm the heart. ""Sudden cardiac death usually occurs when multiple risk factors are present,"" he explains. ""When you add one, it's kind of like the straw that broke the camel's back."" ""Absolutely the lowest dose that works should be used, because we found a strong dose response,"" Ray says. Jamaison Schuler, a spokesperson for Eli Lilly and Company, the maker of Zyprexa, says, ""Although the study appears to have important limitations, it provides additional information for practicing physicians to consider as they decide how to treat very complex diseases such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."" The FDA has approved atypical antipsychotics for treating bipolar disorder, Ray adds. But the researcher recommends that physicians first try safer alternatives, such as the mood stabilizer lithium. ""That's a very serious illness, and it has important consequences for patients' quality of life and relationships,"" Ray notes. ""If the mood stabilizer doesn't work, I think it's very reasonable to consider an antipsychotic, but...other drugs should be considered first."" Finally, he says, a patient should never stop taking any drug without consulting his or her physician. Nevertheless, anyone taking an atypical antipsychotic for a non-FDA-approved use should consult his physician. ""I think off-label use should be undertaken very cautiously, and its frequency should be much less than it is currently,"" Ray says. Health.com: Superfoods that can save your health . For Susan Craig, the new research makes it clear that treating serious mental illness must go far beyond just prescribing pills. ""We need to be supporting these people in a better, more systematic way,"" she says. ""There's no magic pill. It's treating the whole person.""

""The explosion and fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon and the resulting oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico never should have happened -- and I am deeply sorry that they did,"" he says in his prepared remarks. ""None of us yet knows why it happened. But whatever the cause, we at BP will do what we can to make certain that an incident like this does not happen again."" Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, appeared underwhelmed at Hayward's planned appearance before his committee. CNNMoney.com: BP's Hayward to strike emotional tone . ""Look, he's a corporate guy,"" Stupak said. ""At the end of the day, he's going to put his best foot forward. It's not going to ring true with me or the American public. And we've got a mess on our hands, a disaster, a catastrophic disaster for our environment and those people who lost their lives. He's just going to say, 'I'm sorry, it's not going to happen again.' It's not good enough."" Stupak: Lawmakers going to take Hayward's 'hide off' But Hayward plans to say more than that. The drilling of two relief wells, ""which we believe represents the ultimate solution to stopping the flow of oil and gas from the well,"" has reached depths of 15,226 feet and 9,778 feet, respectively, he says, but they are not expected to be completed until August. ""We have spent nearly $1.5 billion so far, and we will not stop until the job is done,"" he says. Day 58: The latest on the oil disaster . Though the company has accepted that it is the ""responsible party,"" Hayward adds a qualification: ""It is important to understand that this 'responsible party' designation is distinct from an assessment of legal liability for the actions that led to the spill,"" he says. So far, more than 400,000 barrels of oily water mix have been recovered, and the company has paid more than $90 million on the more than 56,000 claims that have been submitted, he says. Additionally, about $16 million is expected to be paid this week to businesses, he says. In all, 32 walk-in claims offices are open in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi. Nearly 700 people have been assigned the task of handling claims, he says. How the oil-disaster flow estimates have evolved . Hayward adds that, though the cause of the disaster remains unclear, his company's investigation suggests that the accident was caused by the apparent failure of ""a number of processes, systems and equipment."" ""Investigations into the causes of the incident are ongoing, and issues of liability will be sorted out separately when the facts are clear and all the evidence is available."" The transcript of Hayward's planned remarks was given to reporters hours after he and other BP executives told President Obama that the company will set aside $20 billion in an escrow account to compensate oil spill victims. The fund ""will not supersede individuals' or states' rights to present claims in court,"" Obama said. BP, he asserted, will remain liable for the environmental disaster in the Gulf. BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said that the board of the oil giant has decided not to pay any further dividends this year. BP also has agreed to create a $100 million fund to compensate oil rig workers now unemployed as a result of closure of other deep-water rigs after the April 20 Deepwater Horizon explosion, Obama said. After taking a beating in recent weeks, BP's stock price closed Wednesday at 31.85, up 1.43 percent for the day. The Obama administration has tapped attorney Kenneth Feinberg to mediate the claims process. Feinberg played the same role in compensation for the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Anyone dissatisfied with Feinberg's handling of their claim will be able to appeal to a three-person panel, then to the federal oil spill liability trust fund and then to court, said Carol Browner, the president's point person on energy and climate change. BP has also paid roughly $70 million to the U.S. Coast Guard for cleanup operations, wire transfer receipts showed. Svanberg apologized to the American people for the disaster. He said he hoped the company could earn back the trust of the American people, because ""we care about the small people."" A few hours later, he issued a statement apologizing for the remark. ""I spoke clumsily this afternoon, and for that, I am very sorry,"" he said. ""What I was trying to say -- that BP understands how deeply this affects the lives of people who live along the Gulf and depend on it for their livelihood -- will best be conveyed not by any words but by the work we do to put things right for the families and businesses who've been hurt. Like President Obama, I believe we made some good progress toward that goal today."" BP has been under intense political pressure to ensure that it can cover all costs related to the catastrophic oil spill, the largest in U.S. history and one that Obama described as an ""unprecedented environmental disaster."" iReport: Share your views, solutions on Gulf oil spill . BP has been siphoning oil from a containment cap placed atop the ruptured well. The company said Wednesday that it has started collecting oil gushing into the Gulf through a second containment system attached to the ruptured well. The new system is connected directly to the blowout preventer and carries oil up to a second ship, the Q4000. By the end of July, officials hope to be able to contain as many as 80,000 barrels of oil per day, said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen. By that time, he predicted, there will be only ""minimal leakage"" around the wellhead. On Tuesday, government scientists increased their estimate of oil flowing into the Gulf by 50 percent -- to between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day. That translates into 1.5 million gallons to 2.5 million gallons per day. The government's previous estimate, issued last week, was 20,000 to 40,000 barrels per day. Obama said Wednesday that BP assured him that recovery efforts should capture up to 90 percent of the gushing oil in the coming days and weeks. ""That is still not good enough,"" Obama said. ""We will continue to press BP and draw on our best minds and resources to capture the rest of the oil until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that is expected to stop the leak completely."" The spill dwarfs the 11 million gallons that were dumped into Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989 when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground, and oil in varying amounts and consistencies has hit the shores of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.","BP CEO releases testimony to be read to Congress on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao became the fifth boxer to win major world titles in five different weight divisions after demolishing WBO welterweight champion Miguel Cotto in Las Vegas on Saturday night. The Filipino, dubbed ""Pac Man"", stopped the Puerto Rican in the 12th and final round to boost his claims to be known as the world's best pound-for-pound fighter with a victory in his seventh weight category -- his Ring Magazine and IBO crowns are not universally recognized. Cotto weighed in at 145 pounds in front a 5,000 strong crowd at the MGM Grand Arena, with Pacquiao tipping the scales at 144 pounds. The fight began well for Cotto as he delivered several powerful jabs, despite Pacquiao's speed. But Cotto found himself on the canvas in the second round after Pacquiao struck him with a flash knockdown . Pacquaio followed this in the fourth round with a right-hook left-hook combo, and continued to punish his opponent, who suffered swelling above both eyes. Cotto lasted until the final round, when referee Kenny Bayless stopped the fight following another onslaught from Pacquiao. ""I heard that he was bigger than me and stronger than me and that's why I tried to be more aggressive and fight toe to toe and try to (negate) his power,"" Pacquiao said. ""Our strategy for the fight was not to hurry, take our time, because we knew his strategy was that he was going to counter. We were very careful in the early rounds then I controlled the fight and tried to put him under pressure. ""We tried our best to knock him out because that's what my trainer said. I thought they were going to stop the fight in the 11th round and I was surprised he made it to the 12th round."" It was Pacquiao's first fight since a stunning knockout of Britain's Ricky Hatton sixth months ago at the same venue, having convincingly defeated the legendary Oscar De La Hoya in his previous outing. Pacquiao, who has won 49 fights, lost three and drawn two, is being lined up for a money-spinning fight with American Floyd Mayweather Jr, who has also won five major titles in five weight divisions. Pacquiao was rated as favorite by Las Vegas oddsmakers, but Cotto -- who has held a world title every year since 2004 -- had just one defeat in 35 fights with 27 knockouts going into the bout.","Manny Pacquiao defeats defending champion Miguel Cotto for WBO welterweight title .

"(CNN) -- The captain of an Italian cruise ship foiled an attack by pirates off the coast of Somalia on Saturday by ordering his security crew to fire back, Italy's ANSA news agency reported. Six armed pirates in a speedboat attacked the ship, which had about 1,500 people onboard, ANSA said. They fled after the security crew fired back. The cruise ship Melody, which is owned by an Italian company, was on its way back to Italy after a cruise, ANSA said. No one was injured in the attack about 180 miles north of the Seychelles. Piracy is rampant off the coast of Somalia despite the presence of foreign navies. The area hardest hit off the coasts of Somalia and Kenya, including the Gulf of Aden, is more than 1.1 million square miles -- four times the size of the state of Texas.","Six armed pirates attacked cruise ship Melody in a speedboat .

"(CNN)  -- The Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday it is conducting a safety review of the asthma drug Xolair after data from an ongoing study suggested an increased number of heart attacks and strokes among patients who use it. The drug, made by Genentech and co-marketed by Novartis, was approved in 2003. The study, which started in 2004 and is slated to end in 2012, was mandated by the agency as part of its post-approval process. The data ""suggest a disproportionate increase in ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias ... cardiac failure"" and other conditions ""in patients treated with Xolair compared to the control group of patients not given the drug,"" the agency said. Xolair is approved for use by adults and adolescents (12 and older) with moderate to severe persistent asthma who react to a perennial airborne allergen and whose symptoms are not well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids. The study that raised the questions is called ""Evaluating the Clinical Effectiveness and Long-Term Safety in Patients with Moderate to Severe Asthma"" -- EXCELS for short. It counted outcomes among some 5,000 Xolair-treated patients and compared them with a control group of about 2,500 patients who were not taking Xolair. The FDA did not recommend changes to the prescribing information and is not advising patients to stop taking Xolair. The agency said it is working with Genentech to get more information. It noted that the observational study is not a randomized trial, the kind that researchers consider to be the gold standard in determining cause and effect. In an observational trial, there can be differences in underlying risk factors for heart attack and stroke between the two study groups. The agency underscored the uncertainty it faces in deciding how to act: ""Posting this information does not mean that FDA has concluded there is a causal relationship between the drug products and the emerging safety issue,"" it said. ""Nor does it mean that FDA is advising health care professionals to discontinue prescribing these products. FDA is considering, but has not reached a conclusion about, whether this information warrants any regulatory action."" In an e-mail, Novartis noted that the study was being ""conducted in a real-world setting"" so the two groups ""differed in their baseline characteristics."" The patients being treated with Xolair, it said, ""had more severe asthma"" and related conditions. That, along with the focus of the study's data collection, made it hard to determine whether the relationship to strokes and heart attacks was causal, it said. But patients and their doctors must cope with even more uncertainty than the FDA has faced, given that neither the drug company nor the agency is making public the data that sparked the alert. ""We're not getting into numbers at this point because we're still in that evaluation stage,"" said Genentech spokeswoman Tara Cooper. ""It's premature to really get into the details at this point."" The drug is used by 30,000 to 35,000 patients, representing less than one half of 1 percent of the eligible patient population, Cooper said. It is administered by injection every other week in a doctor's office. The estimated annual cost of the drug to the doctor -- before it gets marked up for the patient -- is about $19,000, Cooper said. Dr. Tom Casale, the executive vice president of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, said he will recommend that his patients who are on the drug remain on it. ""These are the patients that are more likely to have (emergency room) visits, hospitalizations and more problems with their asthma,"" he said. Still, he said, he would like to see the data that the FDA regulators have seen.","Study suggests increased number of heart attacks, strokes among Xolair users .

"(CNN) -- A medical team exhumed the body of former Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu on Wednesday to try to ensure that the remains are really his, Romanian state media reported. Ceausescu was executed on Christmas Day 1989 in the only post-Berlin-Wall-fall of a Communist regime in Eastern Europe that got really bloody. His remains were ""quite well preserved,"" his son-in-law Mircea Oprean told Romania's Pro TV. The body of Ceausescu's wife also was unearthed, but was not in such good condition, Oprean said. ""The place where they put my mother-in-law was much more humid, so the samples were much more damaged,"" he said. Elena Ceausescu was executed by firing squad along with her husband in the last anti-Communist revolution of 1989 in Eastern Europe. Their children want to be sure that the bodies in the graves are those of the Ceausescus. The remains will undergo DNA testing by the Institute of Legal Medicine, Romania's national news agency Agerpress reported. Nicolae Ceausescu ruled Romania from 1965 until his death. He became infamous for his lavish lifestyle, and started to build a palace for himself in the 1980s with miles of marbles floors and thousands of crystal chandeliers. He was toppled by revolution, tried hastily and executed before the building was completed. Now the seat of Romania's parliament, it is the largest civilian office building in the world -- second in size only to the Pentagon. CNN's Diana Magnay contributed to this report.","Nicolae Ceausescu was executed by firing squad after a bloody revolution in 1989 .

"(CNN) -- In 2006 I spoke at TED about developing children's natural powers of creativity and imagination. Returning to TED in 2010 I wanted to focus on the need for a radical shift in education more generally. Reforming education is rightly seen as one of the biggest challenges of our times. In my view, reform is not enough: The real challenge is to transform education from a 19th century industrial model into a 21st century process based on different principles. Current systems of education are based on the manufacturing principles of linearity, conformity and standardization. The evidence is everywhere that they are failing too many students and teachers. A primary reason is that human development is not linear and standardized, it is organic and diverse. People, as opposed to products, have hopes and aspirations, feelings and purposes. Education is a personal process. What and how young people are taught has to engage their energies, imaginations and their different ways of learning. Learn more about Ken Robinson at TED.com . In the talk I gave at this year's TED conference, I made a passing reference to fast food. Let me elaborate briefly. In the catering business, there are two main methods of quality assurance. The first is standardizing. If you have a favorite fast food brand, you can go to any outlet anywhere and know exactly what you will find: same burger, fries, cola, décor, and attitudes. Everything is standardized and guaranteed. By the way, this ""cheap"" food is also contributing to the most costly epidemic of diabetes and obesity in human history. But at least the standards are guaranteed. The other method of quality assurance are the star ratings guides, like Michelin. These methods do not prescribe what's on the menu, when restaurants should open, or how they should be decorated. They set out criteria of excellence and it's up to each restaurant to meet them in their own way. They can be French, Mexican, Italian, Indian, American or anything else. They can open when they choose, serve what they like and hire whom they want. In general they are much better than fast food and offer a higher standard of service. The reason is that they are customized to local markets and personalized to the people they serve. Education reform movements are often based on the fast-food model of quality assurance: on standardization and conformity. What's needed is a much higher standard of provision based on the principles of personalized learning for every child and of schools customizing their cultures to meet local circumstances. This is not a theory. There are schools everywhere that demonstrate the practical power of these principles to transform education. The challenge is not to take a single model to scale but to propagate these principles throughout education so that teachers, parents, students and principals develop their own approaches to the unique challenges they face in their own communities. Standardization tends to emphasize the lowest common denominator. Human aspirations reach much higher and if the conditions are right they succeed. Understanding those conditions is the real key to transforming education for all our children. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ken Robinson.","Sir Ken Robinson: School reform is often a process of mandating standards and uniformity .
Industrial model for schools provides standards but no room for creativity .
He says for creativity to thrive, schools must meet individual and community needs ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Sen. Arlen Specter woke at 4 a.m. one day last week with an excruciating headache, a side effect of chemotherapy. Ninety minutes later, he was on the squash court, playing a partner less than half his age. That's the way Specter faces cancer and chemo. Borrowing a phrase from Winston Churchill, he calls it the ""never-give-in"" approach. Sen. Arlen Specter on May 7, early in his chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease. As he battles a recurrence of Hodgkin's disease, Specter, 78, a Pennsylvania Republican, plays squash nearly every day, as he has for decades. He calls the games ""deposits in the health bank."" He also continues his rigorous work schedule. ""Doc,"" he told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, ""I don't have time to think about Hodgkin's."" Hodgkin's disease is a rare but curable form of lymphoma. But the treatment feels, as Specter puts it, ""like a war of the worlds raging inside your body."" Early this month, just after CNN was granted exclusive access to follow Specter's treatment, his colleagues would stop him in Senate hallways to tell him how good he looked. He would always fire back: ""In a few days, I'll be thin and pale and bald.""   Watch Dr. Gupta's behind-the-scenes coverage of Specter's battle with cancer » . His prediction is already coming true as he reaches the halfway point in his three-month-long regimen of weekly chemotherapy. Specter has been through one major health crisis after another over the past 30 years. At age 48, he was told he had Lou Gehrig's disease, an incurable degenerative condition. Several months passed before he was told that the diagnosis was wrong and that a mild case of childhood polio had produced a false positive. Then, in 1993, Specter was told that he had a cancerous brain tumor and had just a few weeks to live. Another misdiagnosis. The tumor was benign and safely removed. It returned three years later and was removed again. Two years after that, in 1998, he had heart bypass surgery, after which he nearly died in the hospital.  Watch more from Dr. Gupta and Specter » . And then, in 2005, after a stressful battle to win the powerful chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he began suffering from extreme exhaustion, fever and night sweats. Doctor after doctor told him he had a virus. Yet another misdiagnosis. Finally, after several months, a blood test indicated something more serious. Specter had Hodgkin's disease, a cancer of the lymphatic system that's diagnosed in only about 7,500 patients in the United States each year. Specter's was in the most advanced stage. He beat it. But it's back. Specter is 78. But his oncologist, Dr. John Glick of the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania, stresses that chronological age is not the key determinant of how he's treating Specter.  Watch more on Specter's treatment » . Because of Specter's physical conditioning and his mental attitude, Glick found the senator to be a strong candidate for aggressive treatment. ""The same treatment we would give somebody half his age,"" Glick said.  Watch more from Dr. Glick » . Specter's continued hard work throughout treatment may be beneficial, his cardiologist says. Specter should ""keep on working as aggressively as he always has, says Dr. Howard Weitz of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ""I think for the hard worker who ceases working, their stress level increases.""  Watch  more from Dr. Weitz » . When Specter learned that his Hodgkin's had returned, it was a different shock"" from the first time, he said. ""I knew what to expect, and I thought to myself, 'Oh, for Christ's sake, I have to do this again? ... And I said to myself, 'Arlen, what is, is. You got it.' And on Week Two, I was dealing with it."" Specter does not sugarcoat anything. Although he continues his squash routine, he notes that on the court ""my breath is much shorter, I'm perspiring more, and I can't play as long."" He adds, ""I think there's a vitality in that which is healthy."" And although he doesn't cut back on work at all, he does retreat to his Senate hideaway office for extra naps. And given all the misdiagnoses he's been given in his life, he has one more piece of advice: ""Get a second opinion."" Michael Schulder is a CNN senior executive producer.","U.S. Sen.

"Washington (CNN)  -- Legally, President Obama can effectively fire BP and have the federal government take over efforts to stop the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The question is whether that would help the situation. No one argues that the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 gives Obama the authority to take over all efforts to plug the well gushing 5,000 feet beneath the surface. However, officials of oil giant BP, while acknowledging their failure so far to stop the leak, say no one -- not even the U.S. government -- can match their company's know-how and technology in such a crisis. ""I don't think anyone else could do better than we are,"" Doug Suttles, the BP chief operating officer, said Monday. ""I know that that's frustrating to hear and our performance, to this point, I wish was better. I wish this was done. But we're doing everything we can. And I don't actually believe anyone could do any better, unfortunately."" Administration officials also have said they lack the technology -- such as unmanned submarines that can work at such ocean depths -- that has been deployed by BP. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who previously threatened a government takeover of the mission, made clear Monday that BP must be involved in trying to stop the leaking oil. ""There are areas where BP and the private sector are the ones who must continue to lead the efforts with government oversight, such as a deployment of private sector technology 5,000 feet below the ocean surface to kill the well,"" Salazar said Monday. ""BP and the private sector, with the help of federal scientists, are the ones who must get that problem solved and we have the oversight capacity in the administration to make sure that they are doing that."" In addition, the administration's point man on the spill response, Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen, said Monday that BP's strategies were endorsed by other top oil company executives and he would advise against any shift from BP's continued involvement. ""They have the means of production,"" Allen said at a White House news conference. ""They have the logistics in place. They have the ROVs [remotely operated vehicles] that are down there. We are jointly operating in their command post out of Houston [Texas]. Everybody that has a stake in the fight is there. And I am satisfied with the coordination that's going on."" While the military has some deep-sea capability, such as deep-sea submersibles, a senior Pentagon official said the military has no unique technology to offer regarding offshore oil drilling. The military has undersea imagery technology, but military officials said it would not add any capability to what the private industry is already using. Fadel Gheit, managing director for oil and gas research at the Oppenheimer & Co. investment bank and firm, said the government has the authority, ""but we don't have the technology or ability to do it."" ""The government is not in the oil business,"" Gheit said, adding that BP is the industry leader, and ""if they cannot do it, nobody else can. Period."" Salazar said Sunday that the federal role in stopping the leak is overseeing BP's efforts rather than taking over. At the same time, he said the government could exert its full authority with regard to dealing with the spilled oil once the leak is stopped. ""With respect to the rest of the responses, including keeping the oil from coming near shore and onshore and dealing with those ecological values, BP, again, is the responsible party and is on the hook for doing everything that needs to happen,"" Salazar said Sunday. ""If we find that they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing, we'll push them out of the way appropriately and we'll move forward to make sure that everything is being done to protect the people of the Gulf Coast, the ecological values of the Gulf Coast, and the values of the American people."" Since the April 20 explosion and fire destroyed the Deepwater Horizon offshore rig, setting off the deep-sea gusher, oil giant BP has led the effort to stop the leak. Several failed efforts in the ensuing month have raised frustration across the nation as the spilled oil spreads, coating some Louisiana coastlines and threatening areas to the Florida Keys and perhaps beyond. Obama is coming under increasing criticism for the inability to stop it, causing his chief spokesman to mount an impassioned defense of administration efforts. ""First and foremost, we are trying to do everything, as I've said, humanly and technologically possible, first to plug this leak and, secondly, to deal with what has spilled,"" Gibbs told reporters Monday. Even Obama's critics seem to recognize there are limits to what the government can accomplish. ""They can fire BP and take it over,"" Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said Sunday on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" ""But the truth is, the federal government probably doesn't have the capacity to do that."" Marcia McNutt, the U.S. Geological Survey director who is assisting in the Gulf oil spill response, said Sunday that initial unrealistic expectations about the possibility of stopping the leak may be heightening the frustration now. ""I think everyone has to understand that the kinds of operations they are doing in the deep sea have never been done before,"" McNutt said. ""And I think it is too bad that expectations were probably raised on schedules that probably were impossible to meet in terms of the kinds of construction that was required in the deep sea to effect these operations; that involved mobilizing equipment, fabricating new devices that had never been deployed at these depths before."" CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Oil Pollution Act of 1990 gives president authority to take over efforts to stop oil gusher .

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- President Obama made a couple of stupid little jokes about Vegas. He uses our Las Vegas as a symbol. Everyone knows what Vegas means. Doc Pomus wrote ""Viva Las Vegas"" for Elvis years before Doc ever visited Sin City and got everything right. Vegas means ... wild, irresponsible, what-happens-here-stays-here. Smoke cigars, have sex with strangers, get wasted and see stupid shows with stupid Elvis impersonators doing stupid impressions of that stupid hillbilly. That's an image we know and love in Vegas. It's the image we spend our stupidly low tax money to promote. ""What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas"" was an official slogan. It's the Vegas image Katy Perry has in her video, ""Waking Up in Vegas,"" and Penn & Teller do a cameo in that video. We all promote that image. In Vegas, our service industry services that nutty image. We make money off people thinking Vegas is a place to get stupid and waste money. I know a joke when it bites me in the ass. And I've done plenty of jokes biting other people's asses. It's my job. It seemed like Obama was off-prompter for his Vegas bashing. His attacks weren't like Ford trashing New York City (I lived in NYC when Ford was doing all the Big Apple trashing - maybe it's ME the presidents hate). Gerald Ford and Jesse Jackson meant it about NYC. I know Obama doesn't really hate Vegas. I bet he'd have a blast here, if he were still welcome. Obama's good-natured symbolic joke was an applause line. People knew what he meant and agreed. Yeah, don't waste money on Vegas, send the children to college! The last time Obama made a negative comment about Vegas, some jumpy, patriotic, image-conscious corporations canceled some trips here. That's what we figure here in Vegas. There's no way to really know if many people really canceled. Do people really go to the president for travel advice? But in Vegas, most of us make our money from tourism or serving others who make their money from tourism. Tourism is what we really, really do in the Silver State. It's not like Obama is giving the Mojave subsidies for not growing soybeans. It's too easy to not grow soybeans in the stinking desert; we do it for free. Not farming is one of our Vegan gifts to the rest of the country. We don't know how much, but when the president of the United States of America makes his jokes about Vegas -- he costs real people real money. Obama knows that no one cares if Penn Jillette has less money. Obama is pretty happy to say that the rich (and, man, am I rich. I don't have even 10 percent of the money Obama has, but I'm rich by my hometown standards) should have more money taken from them. Who cares about a magician losing money? Not even me. I'll be fine. My children will go to college if they want. But, when people cancel trips to Vegas, I'm not the one who gets laid off. A few less people go to the Penn & Teller Theater, and we still do fine, but the hotels lay off other people. It's the people downstream of me who get punished for the president's joke. We all know what Obama thinks is so laughable about Vegas. We know why we're a symbol of wasteful stupidity. We're a city built on gambling. It's gambling no matter how much PR calls it ""gaming."" Things have changed over the past 10 years. The shows and the restaurants are no longer loss leaders, we make real money on things other than gaming. There's a wonderful, normal suburban community here, but the symbol is still gambling. We have gambling with money, but we also symbolize all sorts of other real-life gambling. After your fiance dumps you, maybe you'll fly to Vegas with the boys and someone who happens in Vegas will stay with you the rest of your life. Maybe you'll really get lucky. Teller and I moved to Vegas to do our own show in our own theater. We took a big chance. Vegas also stands for stupid gambling like that. Vegas is gambling in the broad sense, the idea that taking a wild chance on an unknown might turn out to be a good thing. What's the main thing that drives stupid gambling? Hope. I'm not sure how I feel about hope. I don't gamble in the casinos. That kind of regimented hope seems less fun to me. I'm a skeptic. I'm pro-science. I like to say I don't believe in hope, but I had the hope to move to Vegas to do a magic show. And I do hope that Vegas pulls through this bad economic time and people come and visit us and we do our stupid shows for all the stupid, hopeful people. Obama, please remember, it was those stupid, very hopeful people who took the over on a stupid point spread on Obama with a stupid hope to help our country, which includes stupid Vegas. The gamble Obama took with his run for president and the gamble that the American people took on him sure weren't taken at good odds. It wasn't putting everything we had on red in roulette, or ""don't pass"" in craps, or carefully counting cards in blackjack. Obama's presidency is more than all of us putting our whole future on 00 in roulette. It was more like putting everything we had on one slot pull at the stupid Elvis impersonator slot machine in the stupid Elvis casino for the stupid hillbillies who are filled with hope. Maybe the Vegas jokes in the Beltway should stay in the Beltway. Shortly after Obama's comments, he sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, saying, ""I wasn't saying anything negative about Las Vegas...there is no place better to have fun than Vegas, one of our country's great destinations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Penn Jillette.","President Obama said you don't ""blow cash"" on Vegas when you're saving for college .
Penn Jillette says comment won't go over well in town built on tourism .
He says people who gamble on Vegas also gambled on Obama ."
"(CNN) -- Friday's launch of the iPhone 3GS could usher in an innovative and lucrative new era for those who create applications for the popular device, developers and industry observers say. This woman in an iPhone costume was among the crowd  outside an Apple Store in New York City on Friday. The phone's upgraded hardware, combined with a new operating system, will allow developers to design apps that wouldn't have worked on previous models of the iPhone. For example, developers said, the iPhone 3GS is the first iPhone with a video camera, which could inspire apps that edit or mix video clips. Other developers are eyeing the new phone's built-in compass or its ""push notification"" feature, which pings users with messages even if its instant-message application is not open. ""Apple has given us all these new tools,"" said William Kasel, founder and CEO of Jumpfox, a San Francisco, California-based company that makes mobile apps. ""And I can't wait to see what developers come out with in the next six months. The new features really take [the phone] to a whole new level."" Apple fans in the United States and seven other countries lined up Friday morning to be among the first to get their hands on the new iPhone 3GS, billed as the fastest, most feature-laden iPhone yet. iReport: Buying an iPhone 3GS? Lines outside Apple's 211 retail stores in the United States were generally shorter than for last July's debut of the iPhone 3G, probably because owners of that phone balked at paying upgrade fees to wireless carrier AT&T or could simply update their devices by downloading the iPhone's new 3.0 operating system. The buying process also seemed smoother than last summer's iPhone launch, which was marred by slow-moving lines and a flood of customers trying to activate their phones at once. According to reports on Twitter, many iPhone 3GS buyers were able to activate their phones faster and more smoothly than last year. The new iPhone contains a processor that Apple claims is more than twice as fast as its 3G model, plus a video camera, voice control, longer battery life and a built-in compass. It comes with an upgraded operating system -- which Apple released Wednesday for download onto older iPhones -- with 100 new functions, including the ability to copy and paste text. But the phone's biggest game-changer, observers say, may be new software that allows iPhone users to make purchases within applications. On previous versions of the iPhone, applications linked users to Web sites where they could buy consumer goods or other items. With the new iPhone 3.0 operating system, users can shop entirely within apps designed specially for the phone, which promises to make for smoother transactions. App developers love this new function. Until now, they earned money only when people bought applications through Apple's App Store, or from selling ads within the apps themselves. But now, for example, a game developer could charge users a few extra dollars to access higher levels of a video game. Other apps could allow users to locate the nearest movie theater, and then buy tickets. ""It's a whole new revenue stream,"" said Brian X. Chen, who writes about consumer technology for Wired.com. Chen believes the new feature could help iPhone app developers achieve long-term profits instead of hoping for an App Store ""one-hit wonder"" that sells well and then disappears. ""This could be absolutely huge for a lot of people,"" agreed MG Siegler, who writes for TechCrunch, a popular technology blog. ""There's a lot of money to be made there, I think."" Siegler believes another bonus of the iPhone 3GS's new software is its ability to interact with special accessories via Bluetooth and the phone's dock connector. To cite one example that Apple showcased at a recent 3.0 event, a diabetes app could hook up with an insulin meter, allowing a diabetes patient to check his or her glucose levels. Developers already are customizing apps for the new iPhone. Jumpfox is hoping to launch BuzzBuy, its PayPal-like e-commerce widget, as an iPhone 3GS app this summer. And ScrollMotion plans to introduce an upgraded version of its Iceberg reader, which will allow iPhone users to download more than 50 magazines, 170 newspapers and 1 million books to their devices for reading on the go. ""We love the new 3.0 functionality,"" said Josh Koppel, a ScrollMotion co-founder, who also believes the phone's copy-and-paste feature will help students and other readers get more use from the Iceberg app. ""A new way to monetize on this magical device ... is the best thing we could have asked for."" The popular phone went on sale Friday in the U.S. and Canada plus six European countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.  Watch iPhone buyers lined up in London » . About 300 people stood outside the flagship Apple Store on New York's Fifth Avenue waiting for the doors to open Friday morning. In Atlanta, Georgia, more than 100 people were in line early Friday outside an Apple Store at Lenox Square mall. ""It doesn't seem like it's the Apple fanatics [this time]. It's moms and dads,"" said Robin Cutshaw, 51, who lined up for previous iPhone launches in 2007 and 2008. An IT specialist, Cutshaw said he travels everywhere with his iPhone and once even used it to work remotely from a beach in Brazil. ""It doesn't go in the shower with me, but that's about it,"" he said. Some who had preordered phones were frustrated by how slowly their line moved outside the Atlanta store. But Marc Kagan, 31, said that buying his new phone took him about three hours, much less than the 10 hours it took last year. Customers encountered problems activating their new phones last July because demand overwhelmed Apple's iTunes servers. But on Friday, Kagan said it took Apple employees about 15 minutes to activate his phone in the store. ""It went pretty smooth. I think they're a little more organized this year,"" he said. AT&T stores, Best Buy and Wal-Mart also are selling the iPhone 3GS, although preorders through AT&T and Best Buy sold out before Friday.   Advance buzz about the iPhone 3GS has been largely positive. In a review, CNET gave it a four-star, or excellent, rating.  Compare the iPhone 3GS to three other smartphones » . An iPhone 3GS with 16 gigabytes of storage sells for $199 with a new two-year AT&T contract; one with 32G capacity will cost $299. Since June 8 Apple has been selling the iPhone 3G model for $99 -- half its original price. Apple has sold more than 17 million iPhones since the iconic device hit the market in 2007.

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Conson was downgraded from a typhoon early Saturday, a day after the deadly storm roared into China, along the southern tip of the island of Hainan. Conson is forecast to move through the Gulf of Tonkin on Saturday, making a final landfall in northern Vietnam, near Hanoi, in the afternoon, according to CNN World Weather. The storm, which killed at least 39 people during its westward march across the Philippines this week, had maximum sustained winds of 112 kph (70 mph) Saturday, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. At one point Friday morning, the storm's winds reached 139 kph (86 mph), making it the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane when it reached China. Southern China already had been battling severe flooding that killed 146 people over the past two weeks, destroyed about 113,000 homes and forced more than 1.2 million people to relocate this month, state media said Friday. Forty people were missing. According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, Chen Lei of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief office said the coming rain would exacerbate the flooding. Storms and floods have affected more than 35 million people in 10 China provinces this month. By Thursday, the nation had recorded at least 26 billion yuan (about $3.8 billion) in economic losses, Xinhua said. Conson had weakened from a typhoon to a tropical storm before its landfall late Tuesday in the Philippines, but that didn't keep the storm from wreaking havoc as it traversed the archipelago off the Asian mainland. Conson then traveled across the South China Sea, picking up strength. Along with the rising death toll, the Philippines' National Disaster Coordinating Council said Friday that 84 people were missing. CNN's Judson Jones contributed to this report.","NEW: Conson is downgraded to a tropical storm .

"Zhonhgshan, China (CNN) -- Workers at Honda subsidiary in southeastern China intentionally slowed down production at the facility Monday, after returning from a strike, the company said. Previously it was believed that the job dispute -- which, among other strikes of Chinese Honda plant has impacted the global supply pipeline of its cars -- was resolved when the company offered a 200 yuan (U.S. $30) per month pay increase. The plant employs about 1,500 people. Honda Lock -- a subsidiary of Honda Motor Inc. which makes locks, door sensors and mirrors for the company -- believed the negotiations were settled with an agreement reached on Saturday. But Monday, a spokesperson for the company told CNN it is ""embarrassed to report 90 percent of the factory workers are slowing down inside the factory today,"" a Honda Lock spokesperson said. The company is working to redress the situation, the spokesperson said. The wages debate at Honda Lock is a microcosm of labor disputes that are sweeping companies across developed regions of China. As workers seek better wages and working conditions, concerns are being raised that the turbulence could disrupt China's development model of offering multinational companies access to a massive, low-cost labor force. ""This is an ongoing process since China joined the WTO (in 2001).  Chinese workers have enjoyed pay raises for some years,"" Pu Yonghao, chief Asian investment strategist for UBS Wealth Management, told CNN. ""We've come to a point where we will see more wage increases because a lot of national or multinational company's minimum wage level is below the market level -- that's why we see more strikes and more unrest,"" Pu said. Productivity in China has increased faster than pay increases, Pu said, and could hasten the trend of moving labor-intensive labor farther inland or to other low-cost labor centers such as Bangladesh and Vietnam. Honda Lock workers interviewed by CNN said they want their monthly base salary increased to 1600 yuan ($234). The basic salary used to be 900 yuan, workers said, although with overtime that usually rose to about 1200 yuan ($175) a month. They were seeking a pay increase similar to the 500 yuan ($73) pay increase given to workers striking at the Nanhai Honda Auto Parts Manufacturing company. ""Our salary is not enough. (After) living costs and rent, we have nothing left,"" one worker, who asked not to be named, told CNN. Adds Liu Ping, another worker there: ""Nanhai Honda is Honda and we are also Honda. Living cost is similar but how come their salary is so high?"" Monday's on-the-job slowdown was the latest tit-for-tat in the ongoing labor dispute at the Zhongshan plant, located in Guangdong Province near Hong Kong. Even as an agreement appeared to be reached on Saturday, the Honda plant was actively recruiting replacement workers over the weekend in case the negotiations were unsuccessful to return existing employees to the line. ""I've been looking for a job for months -- I may want to work there,"" one person in line for a job interview told CNN. On Monday morning, a factory manager stood outside and counted down the minutes before the morning shift began, threatening that strikers who did not return back to work would be replaced. About 100 employees were demonstrating outside before most went back into the factory to begin the morning shift. Still, some workers say they are willing to be fired in their quest for better wages -- especially since there are regional job shortages for qualified workers. ""If most of us are fired because of this, I am not scared. Around here there are many factories with high salaries,"" one worker told CNN. She said she hopes she will be able to send more money back home to her parents with her salary increase. ""I don't have any money left after deducting rent and meals,"" she said.

"London, England (CNN) -- Exactly five years after the suicide bombings on the London transport network killed 52 people, a woman who lost her legs in the attacks was flying to the United States as a Paralympic hopeful. London's Martine Wright is competing this week in the world championships for sitting volleyball, a sport she says has given her confidence, helped her recover, and now makes her excited for the future. ""I can't not think about the anniversary,"" Wright told CNN at London's Heathrow Airport, as the team was about to depart. ""It's just another weird coincidence that I'm here on the 7th. I'm flying out to do an absolute dream opportunity and I can't get away from the fact that it's happened on the 7th of the 7th. That date seems to be quite significant in my life."" Wright is on Britain's first-ever women's sitting volleyball team, and the 2010 championships in Edmond, Oklahoma, are seen as an important training ground for the 2012 Paralympic Games, which will be held in her hometown. ""Now I'm flying out representing my country to do a sport which, if you would have said this to me five years ago, I would have thought you were absolutely mad,"" Wright said. Wright, 37, used to be an international marketing manager and traveled a lot. She was headed to work on July 7, 2005, when a suicide bomber blew himself up on a subway train near London's Aldgate Tube station. It was one of four locations bombers struck that day. Britain remembers London terror attacks . In addition to losing both of her legs, Wright suffered a fractured skull and severe arm injuries. She was one of the most seriously hurt of the more than 770 people wounded that day. She says it's her duty to those who didn't make it that day to achieve all that she can. ""I've got to grab every opportunity for every single one that didn't survive that day,"" she said. ""I think it's my duty to go out and live life to the full, really."" Just a day before the attacks, Wright watched with her colleagues on large TV screens as London was awarded the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. She said she knew her colleagues were watching those same TV screens for news about the bombings a day later as she lay wounded. She tried going back to work for a few months after the attacks, but found her priorities had changed. She wanted to spend more time with her family, which now includes a one-year-old son whose original due date was July 7, 2009. (He was born eight days late.) It was at a ""taster"" day for disabled sports that Wright first sampled sitting volleyball, a version of the sport that allows anyone to play, including those with a disability. ""What I love about it is, number one, I'm not in my chair,"" she said. ""You play on the floor so all you need is a ball and a net and your bottom, basically."" International volleyball rules apply in the sitting version, with certain amendments for disabled players: During play, a player must touch the court with some body part between the buttocks and the shoulders, and players are allowed to block serves. The sport is also played on a smaller court with a lower net than the more common version. The men's event has been part of the Paralympics since 1980 and the women's since 2004, according to the British Volleyball Federation. Last month, Wright won a place on Britain's squad, whose members say they're determined to compete at the Paralympics in two years' time. ""It's a phenomenal achievement because the program is so new,"" said team captain Emma Wiggs. ""It's so exciting to be part of something as new and as promising as I believe our squad is, but quite daunting to think we're going to be facing teams that are far more experienced than we are."" Britain's women's team faces stiff competition in Oklahoma from countries like China, Russia, and Eastern European countries, Wiggs said. Vice captain Andrea Green said she was feeling the butterflies in her stomach but believed the team could perform well. ""We're just a good unit, really,"" Green said. ""We're all very positive, we all stick together, we're a nice group, we get on well together. So our strength, really, is that we're all determined to enjoy the games and learn as much as we can."" Even if the team doesn't win, Wright said, they're looking ahead to 2012 and hoping to represent their country on home soil. ""On that day five years ago it was such a negative thing that happened in London,"" she added, ""so for me to go back to London and return on such a high would just be fantastic, and it would seem like I've gone full-circle as well.""","Martine Wright lost both legs in 2005 London bombings .

"London, England (CNN) -- Stepping on the London subway train five years ago, the thirtysomething marketing manager never imagined her morning commute might eventually lead to the Paralympic Games. Now, that's exactly where Britain's Martine Wright is setting her sights. Wright lost both legs when a suicide bomber blew himself up on a subway train near London's Aldgate station on the morning of July 7, 2005. She also suffered a fractured skull and severe arm injuries. Though she was one of the most seriously hurt that day, Wright is now aiming for a spot on the British Paralympic volleyball team in 2012. ""I would love, absolutely love, to be part of the Paralympics in 2012,"" Wright told CNN affiliate ITN last month. ""I mean, if you had said that to me five years ago, I would have thought that you were absolutely mad. But to go back to London, where I was born, and to do something so positive -- after I left on such a negative -- would be absolutely amazing."" Four bombs were set off that day in July, on three subway trains and a bus. Fifty-six people were killed, including the four bombers, and more than 770 were wounded. The bombings happened the day after the International Olympic Committee announced London would be hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012. Wright said she made a promise to herself and her family after the attacks to ""grab every single opportunity"" that she could. ""I think I've done more now than what I did before,"" she told ITN. ""I've learned to fly planes, and I've jumped out of a plane, learned to ski again."" She competed for -- and won -- a place on Britain's sitting volleyball squad. The British Volleyball Federation announced her place on the team last month, and this week the team is competing at the 2010 Sitting Volleyball World Championships in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. Some 640 athletes from 20 countries are taking part in the event, the biggest major international competition before London 2012, according to Lisa Wainwright, chief executive of Volleyball England, the sport's national governing body. John Bestebroer, the head coach of the women's team, calls the championships ""a great training opportunity for 2012."" Sitting volleyball is a version of the sport that allows anyone to participate, including those with a disability.

Also, sitting volleyball is played on a smaller court with a lower net. Wright told London's Evening Standard that the 2012 Games will have an added poignancy because her last real memory before the bombings was celebrating with colleagues when London was chosen to host the Olympics. She was the last person pulled from the station that day, and Wright said she feels she's one of the lucky ones. ""Even on your darkest days, there will always be someone that's worse than you are, unfortunately,"" Wright told ITN. ""There were 52 people that day who were definitely worse than me, 'cause I'm still here.""","The July 7 bombings in 2005 killed 56 people, including four suicide bombers .

"(CNN) -- I never thought that this show would last 25 years -- I didn't even know it would be a success.   I took it on kind of a dare. There was a three-year deal with Ted Turner, but I had an option to get out after a year.   I never thought I'd be on worldwide, or we'd have the kind of impact we've had on elections and cable in general. Now, we're the longest-running show ever on the same network, at the same time, with the same host. And now you guys are picking the top moments in our shows history. Here's what I think of the results so far, with a week to go in the voting. 1. 9/11 -- We were part of that whole story. The moment focuses on the week I was in New York after 9/11, and I think that was some of the best broadcasting we've ever done. We had in-depth interviews, we were at the site. We had principle people. We covered it as well as I think any show ever covered anything. My strongest memory from that week was when the fire commissioner of New York took me through the rubble. I interviewed firemen and policemen who were there at the aftermath. I remember the drive down, and the barricades, and wearing the mask. Then going to the burn center -- the same hospital where I had my heart surgery. That was a momentous thing; it's almost impossible to describe what that was like. Then the night we aired that, Mayor Rudy Giuliani was my guest and that was an amazing interview. 2. Obama inauguration  -- It surprises me a little that it's number two right now. We had good shows, but everybody covered it. I would have thought Sinatra and the Beatles would have been up higher. The inaugural event was tremendous -- I think we did a good series of shows. We were on top of the story with good guests, but it surprises me it's up there. Maybe that's because it's one of the most recent. 3. Death of Michael Jackson  -- Same thing here as with the Obama inauguration. Happened recently, powerful impact ... The figure he was, the shock -- for it to happen at his age. I think all that has bearing. But all of the top three were tremendous news stories. 4. Simpson Car Chase -- I thought this would be higher than it is, because I was in a position of describing an event as it was happening. I'm 2,500 miles away in our Washington studios, talking about a city I wasn't familiar with. I'd gone to L.A., but I didn't know those highways then like I do now. I had the map and was continuously broadcasting for three hours. I'm not surprised at that at all. I thought it would be higher than number four. 5. Marlon Brando -- I thought this would be number one, but the problem with this world today is the Brandos, the Sinatras ... as great figures as they were, it fades. It's yesterday. It's sad in a way, but it's the lay of the land. Same with the three Middle East leaders. But the problem is the situation hasn't improved, all three of those guys are gone. It's yesterday.

"(CNN) -- The L.A. Lakers beat the Boston Celtics 102-89 in the first match of the NBA finals in Los Angeles on Thursday night, as they attempt to defend the title they won last year. L.A.'s star guard Kobe Bryant -- who is aiming to win the NBA title for the fifth time in his career -- scored 30 points to take his side to victory over their east-coast rivals. The Lakers led from the start and had a five point lead after the first quarter, which they increased to 20 points with just 10 minutes left to play. The match marked their 12th consecutive win at home in the post-season and they will now host the second game of the best-of seven match series on Sunday 6 June, before play moves to Boston. Spanish center Pau Gasol played a key role in the first-match for the west-coast team, scoring 23 points. ""Pau played a big game tonight. His movement and his activity was important,"" Lakers head coach Phil Jackson told the team's official Web site. Andrew Bynum -- who despite suffering with a right knee injury prior to the match which threatened his place in the team -- also contributed to the Lakers win, finishing with 10 points. ""It was great to have Andrew,"" team-mate Gasol told the official Lakers Web site. ""Obviously he was a big factor tonight. Really contributed in different ways, and we want to see him as much as possible out there."" And after crashing with the Celtics Paul Pierce in the opening 27 seconds of the game and receiving a double technical foul, Ron Arrest went on to score 15 for his team. The Celtics did fight back in the closing stages but even an impressive run of 12 points in 27 minutes from Ray Allen came too late to halt their L.A. rivals. Veteran Celtics player Kevin Garret -- a previous winner of the NBA title -- could also not help his team, missing an open lay-up in the last few minutes of play and only scoring seven.

"(CNN) -- West Indies cricket officials have moved two international matches from Jamaica due to the outbreak of violence on the Caribbean island. The final one-day international of the series against South Africa has been switched to Trinidad along with the first of three five-day Tests against the tourists, as a state of emergency is in effect in the Jamaican capital of Kingston. More than 500 people have been arrested, the Jamaican government said on Tuesday, with at least 44 dead according to reports following violence after a failed attempt to arrest a suspected drug kingpin. Cricket South Africa chief executive Gerald Majola backed the move by the West Indies board. ""CSA is monitoring the situation closely there with the West Indies Cricket Board, the International Cricket Council and the South African Government,"" he told the Cricket South Africa Web site. ""The Proteas' safety is our first priority and we thank that WICB for their swift action. Kingston's Sabina Park had been due to host the fifth one-day match on June 3, as well as a warm-up game on June 6-7 and the opening Test from June 10. The two internationals will now be held at Port of Spain's Queen's Park Oval, while the venue for the practice game has yet to be confirmed. South Africa won both Twenty20 matches, which followed the world tournament for cricket's shortest format, and have a 2-0 lead in the ODI series going into the matches in Dominica on Friday and Sunday.

"Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- Poland's Interim President Bronislaw Komorowski has won a runoff election against Jaroslaw Kaczynski, twin brother of former President Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in a plane crash in April. The Polish electoral commission said Monday that Komorowski garnered 53 percent of the vote versus Kaczynski's 47 percent. Sunday's ballot was required under Polish law after an earlier round of voting failed to give either candidate more than 50 percent of the vote. Both candidates addressed supporters in televised speeches from their campaign headquarters Sunday night, after exit polling showed Komorowski holding a slim lead. Kaczynski had congratulated his rival on exit poll results, but had not conceded victory. Komorowski said, ""I congratulate Poland and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for turning out to vote in such large numbers."" The president in Poland is primarily a ceremonial figure, but he has the power to veto laws, and thus helps shape politics. Kaczynski, once prime minister, is a divisive figure in Polish politics. His far-right Law and Justice party ran on a nationalist platform with the slogan, ""Poland comes first."" ""Poland has to be a strong country, otherwise it will not exist,"" he said recently. ""I want to tell everyone here that as president I won't just be the head of state -- I will look after the strength of the Polish nation."" Komorowski is a moderate who ran for the center-right Civic Platform. ""We have been on this road for 21 years together, and we have been right,"" Komorowski said on the campaign trail. ""We have been moving toward democracy and navigating our way in a free economy."" The former president, his wife and more than 90 others were killed April 10 in western Russia on their way to a service commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Russian massacre of Polish prisoners of war in the village of Katyn.","NEW: Interim President Bronislaw Komorowski wins runoff with 53 percent of vote .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed a resolution apologizing to African-Americans for the wrongs of slavery. The nonbinding resolution sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, is similar to a House resolution adopted last year that acknowledged the wrongs of slavery but offered no reparations. The House will have to vote on the issue again because the composition of that chamber changed after last November's elections. The resolution was approved on a voice vote. Because it is nonbinding, it does not have to be forwarded to the president for his signature. Several states have passed similar resolutions, but the House resolution was the first time a branch of the federal government did so. Harkin's resolution ""acknowledges the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery, and Jim Crow laws,"" and ""apologizes to African-Americans on behalf of the people of the United States for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow laws."" Jim Crow laws were state and local laws enacted mostly in U.S. Southern and border states between the 1870s and 1965 that denied African-Americans the right to vote and other civil liberties, as well as legally segregated them from whites. Some members of the African-American community have called on lawmakers to give cash payments or other financial benefits to descendants of slaves as compensation for the suffering caused by slavery.","Resolution acknowledges the wrongs of slavery but offers no reparations .

"New York (CNN) -- Spirit Airlines reached a tentative agreement with its pilots on Wednesday that will end the five-day-old strike that halted the airline's operations, a union official said. Pilots will return to work and Spirit's operations will resume on Friday, the airline said on its website. ""Our pilots worked hard to get a mutually favorable deal that allows the company to grow while improving their wages and benefits,"" said Ben Baldanza, president and CEO of Spirit. The tentative agreement was reached around 1 p.m. Wednesday, according to Capt. Sean Creed, chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association at Spirit. ""It does move closer to the goals that we established for our pilot group and we will move forward with taking it to our pilots for a ratification vote,"" Creed told CNN. Spirit's 440 pilots walked off the job Saturday morning after an ongoing dispute with the airline over the pilot's pay level. ""Our co-pilots were making significantly below the industry standard,"" Creed explained. The walkout completely grounded the airline. Flights were abruptly cancelled for several days leaving customers scrambling to make other travel arrangements. In effort to make amends with passengers Spirit is offering customers a coupon for $50 off their next flight between June 18 and November 17 and 5,000 free Spirit bonus miles. ""We apologize to those customers whose travel was disrupted as a result of the strike and look forward to earning their trust with ultra-low fares, great service and the best pilots in the sky,"" Baldanza said in a statement.","Spirit Airlines will resume operations Friday, company's website says .

"(CNN) -- Police in Raleigh, North Carolina, arrested 19 people at a rancorous school board meeting Tuesday afternoon where protesters accused the Wake County School Board of adopting a plan that will resegregate the school system. The Wake County School School Board voted in March to stop the decade-long practice of socio-economic school assignment and assign students to their neighborhood schools. The system plans to transition into the new practice in the next 15 months. Currently 85 percent of the system's 143,000 students attend a school within five miles of their home, said system spokesman Michael Evans. Another 12 to 13 percent attend magnet schools and the remaining 3 percent are assigned based on their income level and growth issues. Wake County is a booming school system with unprecedented growth that often requires the students to attend different schools, Evans said. The discontent among opponents, which included the Wake County superintendent who recently resigned as well as the state schools superintendent, has been mounting and also resulted in arrests at a school board meeting in June. Tuesday's meeting agenda did not address the issue, but it was raised by speakers during public comment, Evans said. ""This board cannot and will not permit these distractions to divert our attention away from our priority, and that is of increased achievement for all students,"" school board chairman Ron Margiotta has said. The Rev. William Barber, head of the North Carolina NAACP, was one of the first arrested before he entered the school board building. He led a crowd chanting ""What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now,"" as they descended on the school board building. Before the meeting Barber also spoke at a protest rally that drew about 1,000 people to the state capital. ""This is not a game, Mr. Margiotta,"" Barber said. ""You have in your hands the future of 140,000 young people ... you know educationally, legally and morally your policy changes are wrong."" Another minister, David Forbes, also spoke at the rally, saying, ""'Neighborhood schools' is a trick word to re-segregate a city that worked hard to bring about a progressive new possibility."" Barber and two others were arrested before the meeting for trespassing. Police said they arrested 16 others during the board meeting for trespassing and disorderly conduct. Evans said the protesters locked arms and started singing during the public comment section. ""The board has made decisions. I think they are the right decisions ... there is a big misinterpretation,"" board member Debra Goldman has said. The March vote to return to community schools attendance zones was 5-4.","Police arrested 19, including the state NAACP chairman, at school board meeting .

"(CNN) -- Spain will add the World Cup to their European title by beating the Netherlands in Sunday's final, according to Dutch football legend Johan Cruyff. The 63-year-old was the leading figure in Holland's revolutionary ""total football"" approach in the 1970s, when he also starred for Spanish giants Barcelona for five years before managing the Catalan club from 1988 to 1996. Cruyff's compatriots are seeking to earn the northern European nation a first World Cup title, having lost in the 1974 final in Germany and then again in Argentina four years later when he had retired from the international stage. However, the former Ajax player and manager believes Euro 2008 winners Spain will break their own title drought on soccer's biggest stage in their first final in Johannesburg. ""Spain have always had good footballers and never a team, but now they have one,"" he said, as quoted by the UK Press Association. ""They have worked very well in the last few years and if they get into their rhythm, they should win. Normally Spain play better [than Holland] but that doesn't mean they will win."" Cruyff said coach Bert van Marwijk's unbeaten Dutch side would present a difficult challenge for the Spaniards. Dream swansong for Dutch captain . ""Holland is a very balanced team, they know their strengths and their weaknesses, and up until now they have always been able to make their strengths shine through,"" he said. ""They have two or three players playing at an exceptional level at the World Cup and the team's level has risen enormously."" Spain must improve on their form so far if they are to become the first team in 36 years to win the European Championship and then the World Cup, according to midfielder Andres Iniesta. Only two teams have ever held both titles at once, with France doing it the other way around to Germany by winning the 1998 World Cup and then Euro 2000. Vicente Del Bosque's Spain team have yet to fire on all cylinders at the tournament, losing to Switzerland in the opening match and then winning all three knockout stage matches 1-0 -- including the semifinal against Germany. Striker Fernando Torres has struggled to regain his form after knee surgery, leaving five-goal David Villa to shoulder attacking responsibilities. ""The initial defeat against Switzerland upset us all,"" Iniesta said. ""It was the first game and from that moment we had no margin for error. We knew we could not fail. I hope it proves to be the only game we lose. ""We will play better because we will probably have to if we are going to win the World Cup. What we did in the semifinal certainly won't help us to win the final. ""But I have confidence in my teammates, and I think this group is able to take the final step."" Iniesta said his cohorts were well aware of the enormity of the occasion ahead. ""This is a historic event, a unique opportunity for us all. It makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up just thinking about it,"" the 26-year-old said. ""We have all dreamed of this moment. But we have to finish the dream. We cannot celebrate anything yet. Before us is the challenge of winning a World Cup. ""We are cautious because we know that we still have the last step, and that last step is the most difficult and the most beautiful.""","Spain favorites to beat Netherlands in Sunday's World Cup final, says Johan Cruyff .

"(CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor will undergo hip replacement surgery Monday after she broke her hip when falling out of bed, her publicist said Sunday. Gabor, 93, will need the surgery on her right hip, publicist John Blanchette said. The operation is scheduled for 6 a.m. Monday (9 a.m. ET) and should last about four hours, he said. A press conference is scheduled at Gabor's Los Angeles, California, home at noon Monday, he said. Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, told CNN earlier Sunday, ""She has a broken hip and they have to operate on her. It's a complicated thing. It was an accident. And she is not that young any more."" Von Anhalt said Gabor fell out of bed Saturday night when she reached to answer the phone. An ambulance rushed her to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, after he called 911. He said she was on medication and asleep early Sunday morning. ""Her family is by her side. No other information is available from the hospital per the family's request,"" hospital spokeswoman Roxanne Yamaguchi Moster said in a statement. Blanchette said earlier Gabor was watching ""Jeopardy!"" when she fell out of bed. ""She has an active mind. She's very bright. She's funny. She always makes me laugh whenever I talk to her,"" Blanchette said. ""Her body's failing her."" Blanchette said Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident. The crash occurred when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Her husband has been caring for her, Blanchette said. The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her eight marriages. Among her husbands were hotel millionaire Conrad Hilton and Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge;"" ""The Story of Three Loves,"" 1953; ""The Girl in the Kremlin,"" 1957; and Orson Welles' classic ""Touch of Evil,"" 1958. In 1989, Gabor was sentenced to 72 hours in jail for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer after a traffic stop. She also had to perform community service at a battered women's shelter. The other Gabor sisters were Magda, the oldest, who died in 1997 five days shy of 83, and Eva, the youngest, who died in 1995 at 76. Magda, an occasional stage actress, also was married to George Sanders at one time. Eva is probably best remembered for her role as a socialite turned farmer's wife on the 1960s' TV sitcom ""Green Acres.""

"(CNN) -- Interpol announced Monday it is issuing notices to help search for another 16 suspects believed linked to the January killing of a Hamas leader in Dubai. The organization will now help investigators in Dubai try to track down all 27 people suspected of links to the death of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel. Information gathered by investigators in Dubai ""bore out the international links and broad scope of the number of people involved, as well as the role of two 'teams' of individuals identified by the Dubai police as being linked,"" Interpol said. The organization issued 16 additional ""red notices,"" which are not international arrest warrants but are a way of alerting police forces around the world that the suspects are wanted by authorities in the United Arab Emirates. Interpol had previously issued 11 of the notices covering ""a smaller core group alleged to have carried out the killing,"" the organization said in a news release. Interpol Secretary-General Ronald K. Noble said investigators have established ""clear"" links through passport records, video surveillance, DNA analysis, witness interviews and hotel, credit card, phone and transport records, according to the news release. Two sources told CNN a week ago that the number of identified suspects was up to 27. Of them, 26 were carrying European or Australian passports, authorities have said. The sources -- an official familiar with the investigation and a police source -- did not say which nation issued the passport used by the 27th suspect. Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing, was found dead January 20 in his Dubai hotel room. Police believe he was slain the night before, allegedly by the secretive Israeli foreign intelligence unit Mossad. Dubai's police chief told CNN last month that he is ""100 percent sure"" Mossad was responsible. ""The Mossad needs to be ashamed of its actions,"" said Lt. Gen. Dahi Khalfan Tamim. ""They sent 26, 27 persons to assassinate one man who was involved in the capturing and killing of two Israeli soldiers."" Hamas has said al-Mabhouh was behind the 1989 deaths of the Israeli soldiers. Israel has a stated policy on security matters of neither confirming nor denying involvement. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, however, told Israel Army Radio earlier this month, ""There is certainly no reason to think that the Mossad and not some other intelligence agency of another country operated there."" The total of 27 suspects does not include two Palestinians arrested in Jordan and returned to Dubai. Tamim said one is not believed to be directly involved in al-Mabhouh's death, but ""he is wanted by one of the Palestinian factions in the Palestinian territories and he is sentenced to death and that's why we will extradite him."" He declined to discuss anything about the other Palestinian.","Interpol issues notices for 16 more suspects in killing of Hamas leader in Dubai hotel .

"Washington (CNN) -- The National Tea Party Federation, which seeks to represent the Tea Party political movement around the country, has expelled the Tea Party Express because of an inflammatory blog post its leader, Mark Williams, wrote last week responding to criticism from the NAACP. Williams' blog post satirized a fictional letter from what he called ""Colored People"" to President Abraham Lincoln. Even before this current controversy, the group was criticized by some within the Tea Party movement for being run by Republican consultants and for trying to influence GOP primaries far from its base in Sacramento, California. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser sums up the Tea Party Express and its place in the larger Tea Party movement: . High profile: The Tea Party Express is one of the best-known groups in the movement because of its three high-profile bus caravans and rallies. Sarah Palin spoke at the beginning of its third caravan, which began in Searchlight, Nevada, and its next-to-the-last stop in Boston, Massachusetts, before it ended with a Tax Day rally in Washington. Political impact: The Tea Party Express has become a major player in Republican politics, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads for Republican Senate candidate Scott Brown in Massachusetts who upset Democrat Martha Coakley to fill the late Sen. Ted Kennedy's seat. More recently, the organization helped little-known Sharron Angle win the Republican primary in Nevada to face Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, endorsing her and spending about a half-million dollars on ads for her. The organization says it plans to spend more to help her get elected. The group also targeted incumbent Sen. Bob Bennett in Utah for his vote on the Troubled Assets Recovery Program and helped defeat his bid for a fourth term. It then backed underdog Mike Lee's successful primary campaign and Lee now appears to be a shoo-in to win the general election in November and join the Senate next year. Political action: The group runs the ""Our Country Deserves Better PAC-Tea Party Express.org"" political action committee, which was formed in 2008 to help raise money to oppose presidential candidate Barack Obama. It was created by Republican political consultant Joe Wierzbicki, who appears to have come up with the original Tea Party Express cross-country caravan. What's next?: The Tea Party Express is targeting GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski in Alaska and has endorsed her little-know primary challenger Joe Miller. It plans a Monday event to announce its support.","CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser sums up the Tea Party Express .

"Washington (CNN) -- A top military official at Walter Reed Army Medical Center has been relieved of duty and charged with knowingly falsifying his personnel records. Command Sgt. Maj. Stoney Crump, the senior enlisted officer for the Medical Center Brigade, had the ""intent to deceive"" when he submitted a false official record incorrectly stating that he had attended several military educational courses, according to the Army charge sheet. Among the courses he is alleged to have attended were Reconnaissance School, Sniper School,; Drill Sergeant Course,; U.S. Army Ranger School and several Special Forces schools and courses, the Army charge sheet says. Crump is also charged with falsely stating in a biography he was a registered nurse. Other charges say he knowingly wore up to fifteen service ribbons and awards he was not entitled to wear, including a Marine Corps Combat Action ribbon and a Presidential Unit Citation, which is awarded for an extremely meritorious or heroic act, usually in the face of an armed enemy. In 13 separate counts, Crump is charged under two different sections of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This opens the door to a possible court martial proceeding. The alleged falsification of his records and biography date back to 2007 when Crump was stationed in Germany and has continued until April of this year, according to the charge sheet. As the top enlisted soldier assigned to the Walter Reed medical brigade, Crump would have had continuous contact with wounded troops at the hospital who have won numerous medals and awards in the combat zone.","Medical brigade's senior enlisted officer claims to have attended several educational courses .

"(CNN) -- Rapper T.I., who was sentenced to a 366-day prison sentence in March,  reported Tuesday to a federal prison complex in Forrest City, Arkansas,  according to CNN affiliate WSB-TV. T.I., left, performed to a packed crowd Sunday, days before he was to start a prison term. The rapper -- whose real name is Clifford Harris Jr. -- was required to be at the prison before noon local time to begin serving his sentence on federal weapons charges. According to news reports, officers from Forrest City and the prison set up a roadblock along Arkansas Highway 1 about one-tenth of a mile from the complex. Reporters were not allowed any closer to the prison. T.I. threw himself a going-away party Sunday night at Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia, before a packed house. During Sunday's concert -- called ""T.I.'s Final Goodbye Bash"" -- the 28-year-old Grammy winner reiterated a message that's become familiar in recent weeks: He wants others to learn from his mistakes. ""I'm doing the best I can to get out there, man, and put something positive on these young kids, man,"" T.I. said during the show. ""I try my best. I need y'all help, though."" The rapper played to a sell-out crowd of 16,000 people, said Kenan Woods, a spokesman for the arena. T.I. played through much of his catalog, including the hits ""Whatever You Like,"" ""Live Your Life"" and the Grammy-winning ""Swagga Like Us,"" Woods said. At times in the show, Harris was joined on stage by fellow rapper Soulja Boy and by his five children and mother, Woods said. T.I. was sentenced in March on weapons charges related to purchasing machine guns and silencers. In addition to serving prison time, T.I. was placed on house arrest, was given community service and was ordered to pay a $100,300 fine. Though he had been in legal trouble before, Harris' current situation began when he was arrested just hours before he was to perform at the BET Hip-Hop Awards in Atlanta. The rapper had provided a bodyguard with $12,000 to buy weapons. Harris was not permitted to own any guns, however, because he was convicted in 1998 on felony drug charges -- possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute -- in Cobb County, in suburban Atlanta. After his arrest, he entered a plea agreement, which federal authorities called unique because it allowed the rapper to remain out of prison for a year while he performed community service. Harris has already left a strong mark on the hip-hop genre, music experts told CNN, which should position his career well when he is released. Harris had been named to the Forbes list of top-earning rappers, making an estimated $16 million in 2006. Some music industry observers have said T.I.'s prison term will only make him more popular. ""I think that if anything, it will gain him more fans and actually support his fan base, because he's talked about making a mistake,"" Emil Wilbekin, editor in chief of Giant Magazine, told CNN. ""He's talked about taking care of the error of his ways."" The Atlanta rapper has expressed remorse for the situation. ""I would like to say thank you to some and apologize to others,"" he said at his sentencing in March. ""In my life, I have been placed in the worst-case scenario and had to make the best of it."" In a March interview with CNN's T.J. Holmes, Harris said he no longer felt like he needed to carry weapons to protect himself. He said people should not idolize him for what he's gone through, but should take note of the fact that he has taken responsibility for his actions. ""You shouldn't take the things that I've gone through, and the negative parts of my life, and admire me for that. If anything, admire me for how I've accepted responsibility for the part I played in placing myself in these situations, and what I've done to recover from it,"" Harris said. Harris has been the subject of an MTV reality show, ""T.I.'s Road to Redemption,"" in the lead-up to the prison term.","T.I. performed Sunday, less than two days before his prison term was to start .

"New York (CNN) -- An EMT worker who was involved in a controversial incident in which a pregnant woman died last year was shot and killed Sunday, New York police said. Authorities said they had no immediate link between the EMT's shooting and the widely publicized case last year but that would be an aspect of their investigation. ""That part of the case will be investigated by NYPD. We will be in touch  with Manhattan detectives who will be investigating the murder (of the EMT),"" Brooklyn District Attorney spokesman Jerry Schmetterer. The case involving the EMT -- Jason Green -- and a pregnant woman occurred in Brooklyn last December 9. The woman, Eutisha Rennix, was working as a waitress at a cafe when she collapsed. Rennix's coworkers said Green and a fellow EMT were in the cafe when Rennix collapsed but  the two EMTs reportedly told the co-workers to call 911 and left the cafe without aiding the stricken woman. Rennix later died at a hospital. A spokesman for the EMT and paramedics union said after the incident that Green and his colleague were medical dispatchers and that they did not work with patients. The spokesman added that Green's colleague made a 911 emergency call herself in an effort to get help for the stricken woman. Following the incident, the fire department suspended the two EMTs  without pay for but were reinstated shortly thereafter, EMT spokesman  Robert Ungar said Sunday. ""He (Green) was an EMT with the  emergency medical services bureau of the fire department for seven  years. He was working as a dispatcher and was back on duty at the time  of his death (Sunday). At the time of the previous investigation, the law only  provides for suspension of workers up to 30 days."" Ungar said. Green, 31, was shot outside a downtown Manhattan nightclub at about 5 a.m. Sunday. Police said that Green was shot once in the face and was pronounced dead at a hospital. No arrests had been made as of Sunday afternoon, and NYPD homicide Detective Richard Tireli said that ""the investigation is ongoing."" Meanwhile Brooklyn authorities said Sunday their investigation into Rennix's death was continuing. ""Our involvement is with the incident at the cafe and it's currently still open. The investigation was if there was any criminality involved and if they have violated any criminal laws ... The case is nearing completion and every angle will be investigated.""

"(CNN) -- A Texas bus driver has filed a lawsuit against his former employer, claiming he was fired for his religious beliefs after refusing to transport a client to a Planned Parenthood office, court documents showed Wednesday. Edwin A. Graning worked for the Capital Area Rural Transportation System (CARTS) near Austin, Texas, for less than a year before he was let go in January. At the time, he told his supervisor that, ""in good conscience, he could not take someone to have an abortion,"" according to the lawsuit. Graning is an ordained Christian minister. Planned Parenthood, a health care provider that offers a range of medical services to women, including those related to abortion, often draws the ire of anti-abortion groups in the United States, where the procedure is legal but fiercely controversial. Graning's last day of employment was the same day he refused service. He is seeking reinstatement, back pay, and compensatory damages for pain, suffering and emotional distress. ""It's only because he voiced his religions beliefs that he was canned,"" Edward White III, Graning's lawyer, told CNN. ""Employers have a legal responsibility to at least attempt to accommodate an employee's religious beliefs. ... CARTS clearly violated Mr. Graning's religious freedom."" White, who works for a public interest law group founded by evangelical Christian leader Pat Robertson, said CARTS sent a second driver to collect the client and took her and a friend to the Planned Parenthood office. ""While others may wish to make more of it, to CARTS this is just about our expectation that employees perform the duties they are hired for,"" David Marsh, general manager of CARTS, said in an e-mail message to CNN. In addition to rides along fixed routes, CARTS offers some door-to-door service within its rural coverage area. The lawsuit, in the U.S. District Court for western Texas, Austin Division, was filed on July 14.","Minister says he lost his job after he refused to ""take someone to have an abortion""

"Baluchistan, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan is taking a page from America's counterinsurgency playbook in trying to win the hearts and the minds of those who might otherwise join Taliban militants or Balochistan nationalists against its military. Balochistan province -- Pakistan's largest and one of its most troubled -- is home to a nationalist insurgency and an increasingly violent Taliban presence. The sight of Baloch troops marching in the Pakistani army might have been unimaginable three years ago, but recruits are now training to fight for the army, not against it. More than 3,500 such troops have been recruited since 2007, commanders say. ""The whole exercise is to integrate the Balochi youth,"" said Gen. Athar Abbas, a Pakistani army spokesman. ""If you encourage people all over the province to join the army and the state system ... that is going to diffuse whatever insurgency is left in these parts."" Part of that encouragement includes education. At an army engineering school, free courses are given to hundreds of civilian students. The coursework includes time in a computer, filling an education gap the government can't. ""We are established since the inception of Pakistan and we have more expertise and variety here,"" said Brig. Jamil Sarwar Malik. The army also has made inroads by opening schools. When earthquakes hit the province two years ago, the army rushed in to help, but then stayed and boosted their popularity with a rebuilding program in the absence of government reconstruction. The army said its soldiers gave up a day's pay, more than a million dollars, to build a school. The sum of their efforts have built 25 schools, 12 mosques and four health clinics. After nearly a quarter century, the army has reopened mines that were closed, while warring tribes fought because the central government was keeping the profits. The alienation led to calls for independence -- the Balochistan nationalist movement. With the mines open, $75 million dollars worth of coal has been extracted so far, with $16 billion dollars worth still underground. ""It is being spent overwhelmingly -- over 80 to 90 percent -- on the area itself,"" for residents, for the children and for future generations, said Abbas. But siding with the military can come at a cost. Tribal leader Rab Nawaz Zing said he's been attacked 18 times for supporting the army. He blames other tribal chiefs. ""If you want schools, you get shot,"" he said. ""They say we don't need health centers and roads."" While the counterinsurgency is making progress, the military acknowledges that it will take many more years of its best efforts to turn the tide and make the Taliban and nationalist ambitions a thing of the past.","Balochistan province is home to nationalist sentiments and Taliban violence .

Laying the groundwork for a repeal of the policy will take more than a year, Gates said. In the interim, however, the Defense Department will start enforcing the policy ""in a fairer manner,"" he told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. President Obama called for a repeal of the policy during last week's State of the Union address. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen also endorsed a repeal Tuesday, telling the committee it is his ""personal belief"" that ""allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly [in the military] would be the right thing to do."" ""For me, personally, it comes down to integrity,"" he said. ""The question before us is not whether the military prepares to make this change, but how we best prepare for it,"" Gates told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""We have received our orders from the commander in chief and we are moving out accordingly."" But the ultimate decision on whether to repeal the policy, he acknowledged, rests with Congress. The ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, enacted under President Clinton in 1993, bars openly gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals from serving in the U.S. military, but prevents the military from asking a service member's sexual orientation. It has been a political lightning rod since its implementation. ""I am mindful ... that attitudes towards homosexuality may have changed considerably -- both in society generally and in the military"" since 1993, Gates said. To prepare the military for what has been a long-anticipated change, Gates said he has already appointed a ""high-level"" working group to ""immediately begin a review of the issues associated with properly implementing a repeal."" ""The mandate of this working group is to thoroughly, objectively and methodically examine all aspects of this question and produce its finding and recommendations in the form of an implementation plan by the end of this calendar year,"" Gates told the committee members. ""A guiding principle of our efforts will be to minimize disruption and polarization within the ranks, with special attention paid to those serving on the front lines."" The working group will be led by Department of Defense General Counsel Jeh Johnson and Gen. Carter Ham, commander of U.S. Army Europe, Gates said. The group will ""reach out to the [military] ... to authoritatively understand their views and attitudes about the impacts of repeal,"" he added. ""I expect that the same sharp divisions that characterize the debate over these issues outside of the military will quickly seek to find their way into this process."" Gates noted that the Pentagon will ask the RAND Corporation to update a study it conducted in 1993 on the impact of allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the military. He also said he has directed the Defense Department to ""quickly review the regulations used to implement"" the law and, within 45 days, present possible changes that will allow for more humane enforcement. The secretary acknowledged the impatience many political observers and activists may have with the timetable for a repeal. ""I expect that our approach may cause some to wonder why it will take the better part of the year to accomplish this task,"" he said. ""We looked at a variety of options, but when you take into account the overriding imperative -- to get this right and minimize disruption to a force that is actively fighting two wars and working through the stress of almost a decade of combat -- then it is clear to us that we must proceed in a manner that allows for the thorough examination of all issues."" In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll in April 2009, 48 percent of Americans favored maintaining the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. Thirty-seven percent opposed the policy because they believed it treated homosexuals too harshly, while another 8 percent opposed it because they believed it treated homosexuals too leniently. ""'Don't ask, don't tell' to many people, including myself, seemed so reasonable,"" Alex Nicholson, a former Army intelligence officer discharged for being gay, told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""I knew I was gay going in, and I knew about 'don't ask, don't tell,' but you know, 'don't ask, don't tell' as a sound bite sounds very reasonable. It sounds like nobody will inquire as to your sexual orientation -- as long as you don't throw it in anyone's face, you won't have a problem. ""But after I got in, I realized that 'don't ask, don't tell' was much more all-inclusive and all-encompassing,"" said Nicholson, who now is the executive director of Servicemembers United, an advocacy group that opposes the policy. ""It was more like 'don't ask, don't tell, don't happen to be found out any time, any place, in any way.' "" After about a year, Nicholson said his sexual orientation was found out within his unit. ""That information spread, and then the command was forced into a corner in which they had to discharge me,"" he said. Watch Nicholson talk about his experience . Since the policy was implemented, more than 13,500 service members have been discharged, according to Rep. Jim Moran, D-Virginia. In 2009, there were 428 discharges under the policy -- the lowest rate of discharge since implementation of the policy, he said. The highest year was 2001, with 1,227 discharges, he said. ""This shows that during wartime, DADT is not being pursued aggressively because one's orientation has nothing to do with their ability to fight,"" Moran said in a written statement Monday. Defense officials have said privately that the will to enforce the law is declining. Another military official familiar with the discussion said some of the issues to be considered by the military include the cost of implementing a new policy, benefits for gay spouses, potential hate crimes, and even logistical questions such as the possible need to renovate barracks to separate straight and gay troops. According to the official, separate housing or showers were not considered serious possibilities, but would be discussed in order to be ruled out. Nicholson acknowledged there are legitimate concerns, but said some of the issues raised, such as showers and housing, are merely delaying tactics used to mask ""reasons that people really don't want to see this happen."" At least one member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  -- Gen. James Conway, commandant of the Marine Corps -- has expressed reservations in the past about repealing the law. ""Our Marines are currently engaged in two fights, and our focus should not be drawn away from those priorities,"" Conway said in November through a spokesman. Watch how Joint Chiefs are dealing with the change . Most of the committee's Republicans strongly criticized a potential repeal Tuesday. ""Elections have consequences,"" said Mississippi GOP Sen. Roger Wicker, referencing Obama's promise to end the policy. But ""we'll have a debate about this."" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, a former Navy pilot, said one of the keys to U.S. military power is ""good order and unit cohesion, and ... any practice which puts those goals at unacceptable risk can be restricted."" McCain argued that while ""don't ask, don't tell"" has not been perfect, it has been effective. ""It has helped to balance a potentially disruptive tension between the desires of a minority and the broader interests of our all-volunteer force,"" he said. ""It is well understood and predominantly supported by our fighting men and women. It reflects, as I understand them, the preferences of our uniformed services ... while still allowing gay and lesbian Americans to serve their country in uniform."" But other military veterans support the change. Retired Gen. John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said it is time to repeal the law. ""As a nation built on the [principle] of equality, we should recognize and welcome change that will build a stronger, more cohesive military,"" Shalikashvili wrote in a letter to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, who supports repealing the policy. Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institute said the real test will be in the barracks, with the rank-and-file members of the military. ""We can talk about this delicately or we can just be fairly direct,"" O'Hanlon said. ""There are a lot of 18-year-old, old-fashioned, testosterone-laden men in the military who are tough guys. They're often politically old-fashioned or conservative; they are not necessarily at the vanguard, in many cases, of accepting alternative forms of lifestyle."" Nicholson predicted the matter will become a ""non-issue,"" saying his organization knows of gays serving openly in the military now. Asked whether he would return to the military if the policy is repealed, Nicholson said he would not hesitate and that he has wanted to return since his discharge in 2002. ""I speak five languages, including Arabic,"" he said. ""There's nothing more that I'd love than to go back right now.""

"(CNN) -- It was a night for underdogs at the Golden Globes -- and a particularly rich one for the biggest underdog of them all, ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Dev Patel and Freida Pinto star in ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" which was named best drama at the Golden Globes. The modestly budgeted movie -- about a poverty-raised orphan in Mumbai who goes on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" -- won awards for best drama, best director (Danny Boyle), best screenplay (Simon Beaufoy) and best original score (A.R. Rahman). The victories were all the more astonishing given the film's unlikely production history, which included cobbling together a $15 million budget, shooting on the streets of Mumbai and then struggling for distribution. The film's principals, including Boyle and Beaufoy, were thankful for the support of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which presents the Globes. ""Your mad, pulsating affection for our film is much appreciated,"" said Boyle.  Watch stars on the red carpet » . ""We really weren't expecting to be here in America at all at one time, so it's just amazing to be here,"" said Beaufoy. With the film's victories at the Critics' Choice Awards last week, it must be considered the front-runner in the Academy Awards' best picture race. The Academy Award nominations will be announced Thursday, January 22. iReport.com: Sound off on awards season . Another underdog, actor Mickey Rourke, won best actor in a drama for his performance in ""The Wrestler."" Rourke, who described himself as ""almost out of the business"" not so long ago, gave credit to his agent for backing him and ""Wrestler"" director Darren Aronofsky for sticking with him when the film had trouble finding funding. ""The Wrestler"" also won a Globe for its theme song, written and sung by Bruce Springsteen.  Watch Golden Globe highlights » . Kate Winslet wasn't considered quite as much an underdog, but she still outdid the odds by winning both categories for which she was nominated: best actress in a drama (for ""Revolutionary Road"") and best supporting actress (for ""The Reader"").  Gallery: Winners at the Globes » . Perhaps she surprised herself most of all. After winning best supporting actress -- the first award of the evening -- she asked the audience, ""You have to forgive me, because I have a habit of not winning things."" After the best actress win, she took the stage in a mild state of shock. ""I'm so sorry! Anne, Meryl, Kristin -- oh, God, who's the other one? -- Angelina,"" she said, referring to fellow nominees Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Kristin Scott Thomas and Angelina Jolie. Not long after, being told to wrap it up, she said, ""You have no idea how much I'm not wrapping up,"" before emotionally thanking a variety of people, including co-star Leonardo DiCaprio and husband Sam Mendes, ""Road's"" director. See the list of Globe winners, nominees . Another win was expected, if tinged with tragedy. The late Heath Ledger won the Golden Globe for best supporting actor for his performance as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" ""All of us who worked with Heath on 'The Dark Knight' accept with an awful mixture of sadness but incredible pride,"" said director Christopher Nolan. ""For any of us lucky enough to work with him, he will be eternally missed, but he will never be forgotten."" Ledger died almost a year ago of an accidental prescription drug overdose. Ledger's performance was widely praised and he is considered the front-runner for an Academy Award for supporting actor. He was 28 when he died on January 22, 2008. Oscar nominations will be announced on the first anniversary of his death. Before the show, ""Knight"" co-star Aaron Eckhart told CNN, ""I'm considering it his night tonight."" The Globes also honor TV programs, and in the television categories there were few surprises. HBO's miniseries ""John Adams,"" which dominated the Emmy Awards in September with 13 trophies, won four Globes: best actor (Paul Giamatti), best actress (Laura Linney), best supporting actor (Tom Wilkinson) and best TV movie or miniseries. ""Mad Men"" won best TV drama, as it did at the Emmys, and ""30 Rock,"" another Emmy winner, won best comedy TV series. Though star Tina Fey was announced as the person to accept that award, she let co-star Tracy Morgan have the microphone. ""Tina Fey and I had an agreement that if Barack Obama won, I'd be accepting the awards from now on,"" he said. Fey later won for best TV comedy actress, joining her co-star Alec Baldwin (best TV comedy actor) as Globe winners. The Israeli film ""Waltz With Bashir"" won best foreign-language film. In his speech, director Ari Folman expressed hope for peace in the Middle East. Noting the ""eight beautiful production babies"" born during the show's four-year creation, he said he hopes the children can see the film when they get older, and ""I hope it looks like an ancient video game that has nothing to do with their lives whatsoever."" Other Globe winners included Sally Hawkins, who won best actress in a musical or comedy for her performance in ""Happy-Go-Lucky""; Colin Farrell, who took home best actor in a comedy or musical for ""In Bruges""; ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" Woody Allen's latest, which won best comedy or musical; and ""WALL-E,"" which won best animated film. For those casting metaphorical grass blades into the breeze to see which way the Oscar winds are blowing, the ""Globes"" may have created front-runners in some races, confusion in others. Anne Hathaway had won a few honors for ""Rachel Getting Married,"" but Winslet's win over her at the Globes creates a tighter contest for best actress. Rourke's victory is a feel-good story for an actor many had written off, but he may have to face Frank Langella (Richard Nixon in ""Frost/Nixon""), Sean Penn (a highly praised Harvey Milk in ""Milk"") and Leonardo DiCaprio (Winslet's ""Revolutionary Road"" husband) for best actor. ""Milk,"" in particular, received short shrift from the HFPA; the Motion Picture Academy is expected to be kinder. The Globes' loose atmosphere -- a trademark of the event, which features an open bar and celebrities sitting at large tables -- was evident from the beginning. Jennifer Lopez, noticing a distinct rumble of chatter as she attempted to begin the show, demanded quiet with ""Hello! Hello! Mama talkin'!"" Later, Tom Wilkinson, having won a supporting actor honor for his performance in the miniseries ""John Adams,"" forgot the last name of a person he wanted to thank. There were even a couple of TV no-nos on the live broadcast: ""Wrestler"" director Aronofsky humorously flashed Rourke a middle finger as Rourke talked about how hard Aronofsky worked the cast, and one of the ""Slumdog"" producers uttered the F-word upon seeing he was being rushed through his speech. It was the kind of party people have come to expect from the Globes, a show in which Jack Nicholson once bared his backside and Christine Lahti once was engaged in the ladies' room upon being named a winner. And, if throwing a glamorous party in these nervous, market-plunging times seems a little unusual, it's also something Tinseltown does well -- and that people are expecting, participants said before the broadcast. ""I think these things are entertainment,"" Mendes told CNN. ""This is people's escapism. ... I think in that respect they should be embraced.""","""Slumdog Millionaire"" wins best drama; nets four total wins .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- A dual-pronged effort to stop the oil gushing from BP's runaway well in the Gulf of Mexico shows promise for this weekend, the head of the government's response team said Friday. But things are likely to get worse before they improve. Late Friday, Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said in a statement that he and Energy Secretary Steven Chu had approved BP's plan to install an oil-recovery vessel, the Helix Producer, at the same time that a new cap is placed over the well, ""which will require temporary suspension of the current top-hat containment system."" During the seven to 10 days that it will take to switch the caps, the 15,000 barrels of oil that the Discoverer Enterprise ship has been collecting daily are expected to flow unimpeded into the water, he said. Allen said he approved the plan in order to take advantage of favorable weather predicted for coming days and because, once the switch is complete, the resulting capacity to contain oil ""will be far greater than the capabilities we have achieved using current systems."" BP spokesman Mark Proegler called it the ""capping stack,"" which he described as a larger, better-fitting seal than the one currently covering the well. The latter cap ""can be removed quite quickly"" and BP will start replacing it with the ""sealing cap"" on Saturday, he said. If successful, the operation could halt the gushing that started April 20 after an explosion that killed 11 people on the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf. But any such fix would be temporary, he said. The permanent solution would still be completion of a relief well, he added. Scientists have estimated 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil are spewing daily from BP's breached Macondo well. They have been basing their estimates on high-resolution video and data from acoustic devices used to measure density. But Allen said that, once the long-term containment cap is in place, scientists will for the first time have the empirical data they need to determine the true flow rate. ""I would think once the capping device is on, we would get the most accurate flow rate to date,"" he said. Switching the containment cap could increase the amount of oil collected each day to 60,000 to 80,000 barrels, Allen said. Under a new alignment, four vessels would participate in oil recovery, one more than the three currently involved. In a separate advance, federal responders expressed optimism Friday about a new aerial weapon in their arsenal. A 178-foot U.S. Navy blimp, the MZ-3A, was flown from New Orleans to Mobile, Alabama, to be used to survey the disaster area as soon as Saturday, depending on the weather. Officials said they hope surveys from the blimp will help them cut the time needed to get skimmers to the scene of oil slicks. ""Having something at a low altitude that can stay on scene a very long time is extremely valuable,"" Allen said. ""We are anxious to see how it works."" The first relief well BP is drilling in the Gulf of Mexico could intercept the leaking Macondo well in seven to 10 days, Allen said Thursday. But the time it will take to seal the well will depend on ""where the oil is coming up through, where they can intercept, where they can put the mud in, where they can put the cement plug,"" he said. Also Friday, the president's Oil Spill Commission said it is hiring Richard A. Sears, a deepwater drilling expert with 30 years of experience in the oil and gas industry and academia, to serve as its science adviser. The commission, comprising seven members appointed by President Barack Obama, will hold public meetings Monday and Tuesday in New Orleans. It is charged with determining the causes of the Deepwater Horizon disaster and recommending changes in policies and law to prevent any such future calamities. Commission spokesman Pete Nelson said the commission is also hiring Jay Hakes as its research director. Hakes, an alumnus of the Carter administration, served as director of the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum and headed the Energy Information Administration at the U.S. Department of Energy during the 1990s.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal reversed the trend of big name exits in the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, but the Spaniard had to fight back from dropping the opening set before edging past Argentine David Nalbandian on Sunday. Nadal, who was given a first round bye, recovered from losing an opening tie-break to defeat his opponent 6-7 6-2 6-2, setting-up a fourth round showdown with compatriot David Ferrer. Speaking to the official ATP Tour Web site, Nadal said: ""When you go on court against a player with his talent, you are always a little bit scared what will happen. ""I think having a long first set was better for me than for him. I felt he was a little bit more tired than me. He started to make more mistakes, and it was a little bit easier for me to play. Sixth seed Andy Roddick is also safely through -- with the home favorite in spectacular form as he crushed Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine 6-2 6-1 in just 55 minutes. Eighth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France beat Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-2 7-5 and he next faces 12th seed Juan Carlos Ferrero for a quarterfinal place. Second seed Novak Djokovic and defending champion Andy Murray are among the big names to have already departed the event. Meanwhile, in the women's draw, Kim Clijsters -- who is only seeded 14th for the event -- crushed 17th-seed Shahar Peer 6-0 6-1 in just 51 minutes. The Belgian was joined in the next round by compatriot and wildcard Justine Henin, although the former world number one was made to battle a bit harder before edging past Dominika Cibulkova 6-4 6-4. Second seed Caroline Wozniacki is also through, although the Dane had to fight back from a dismal opening set to defeat Maria Kirilenko 1-6 6-1 6-4, while seventh seed Jelena Jankovic was another women's seed to progress.","Rafael Nadal is through to the third round of the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami .

"(CNN) -- Top seed Novak Djokovic suffered a shock semifinal defeat to Fernando Verdasco on Saturday to end his hopes of avenging last year's loss to Rafael Nadal in the Monte Carlo Masters title match. While Nadal moved a step closer to his sixth successive triumph at the opening event of the European claycourt season in Monaco with a 6-2 6-3 win over fellow Spaniard David Ferrer, world No. 2 Djokovic crashed to a 6-2 6-2 reverse against sixth seed Verdasco. ""I wasn't moving well, I wasn't feeling well on the court -- it was a bad day,"" Djokovic told reporters. Verdasco, who has not beaten his compatriot Nadal in nine encounters, needed little over an hour and a half to overcome the Serbian, who had returned to form this week after a disappointing time in his past two hardcourt events in the United States. ""I want to be the one to break Nadal's streak,"" Verdasco told reporters. ""I tried to use my forehand well against Djokovic and make him really play. This will be my first final in Monte Carlo and I'm really excited."" Nadal took only 76 minutes to reach his 49th final on the ATP Tour with a comfortable victory against 11th seed Ferrer. His last defeat at the Monte Carlo Country Club came as a 16-year-old against Guillermo Coria in 2003, and he has lost only six career matches out of 164 on his favored clay surface. Former world No. 1 Nadal has not won a tournament in 11 months after a year wrecked by injuries. But he now has the chance to equal the record of six Monte Carlo titles held by Englishman Reggie Doherty, who triumphed in 1897-99 and 1902-04. Nadal was happy to make it through to final after falling in the last four in his previous Masters events in Miami and Indian Wells. ""I'm playing very well, I had a very good match today. The last two games, I was a little bit more nervous than usual because I lost two semifinals in a row,"" he told reporters. ""But for the rest, I think I played a very, very complete match. It's great to start the clay season like this. I'm playing well and I'm very happy with my game.""","Fernando Verdasco stuns top seed Novak Djokovic 6-2 6-2 in Monte Carlo semifinals .

"Editor's note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. He is an affiliated professor at Georgetown University's Public Policy Institute and an adviser to the Service Employees International Union, which supports President Obama's health care plan. Paul Begala says health care isn't getting attention it deserves -- and Obama administration is partly to blame. (CNN) -- You probably have never heard of Robin Beaton, and that's what's wrong with the debate over health care reform. Beaton, a retired nurse from Waxahachie, Texas, had health insurance -- or so she thought. She paid her premiums faithfully every month, but when she was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer, her health insurance company, Blue Cross, dumped her. The insurance company said the fact that she had seen a dermatologist for acne, who mistakenly entered a notation on her chart that suggested her simple acne was a precancerous condition, allowed Blue Cross to leave her in the lurch. Beaton testified before a House subcommittee this week. So did other Americans who thought they had insurance but got the shaft. As Karen Tumulty of Time magazine (who has been the journalistic conscience of health care coverage) wrote, other witnesses included: . ""Peggy Raddatz, whose brother Otto Raddatz lost his insurance coverage right before he was scheduled to receive an expensive stem-cell transplant to treat his lymphoma. Why? Because Fortis Insurance Company discovered his doctor had found gall stones and an aneurysm on a CT scan -- conditions that had nothing to do with his cancer, that never bothered him and that he wasn't even aware of. And Jennifer Wittney Horton of Los Angeles, California, whose coverage was canceled because she had been taking a drug for irregular menstruation. Now, she can't get coverage anywhere else. 'Since my rescission, I have had to take jobs that I do not want, and put my career goals on hold to ensure that I can find health insurance,' she told the subcommittee."" The subcommittee's chairman, Democrat Bart Stupak of Michigan, called the hearing to highlight the obnoxious and unethical practice called rescission. His researchers produced performance reviews of insurance company bureaucrats who were praised and rewarded for kicking people off their coverage. Then Stupak asked three health insurance executives the big question: Will your company pledge to end the practice of rescission except in cases of intentional fraud? All three health insurance executives said no. It was as dramatic as congressional testimony gets. Yet it got no airtime on the networks, nor, as far as I can tell, on cable news, although CNN.com did run a story. Time's Tumulty was all over it, as was Lisa Girion of The Lost Angeles Times. But the story did not make The New York Times. Nor The Washington Post, which found space on the front page the morning after the hearing for a story on the cancellation of Fourth of July fireworks in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, but not a story on the cancellation of health insurance for deathly ill Americans who've paid their premiums. Stupak, and the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, Henry Waxman, D-California, did their job. Why didn't the media do its? Why were the outrages uncovered by Stupak and Waxman un-covered by most of the media? Maybe because the Obama White House drew the spotlight away from health care. They'd diverted the media to cover Obama's proposed reforms of the financial regulatory system. On the last day of the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign, we had the media A-Team traveling with us. So I made it my business to sit next to David Gergen, then with U.S. News & World Report but a former top aide to Presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan (at that point -- little did I know he would soon be working for President Clinton). I had never seen a communications shop as effective as Reagan's, and I wasn't going to miss an opportunity to learn from a master. Gergen told me an anecdote I still remember vividly. In the opening months of the Reagan presidency, it was the economy, stupid. America was mired in a recession, and President Reagan wanted to focus the nation's attention on his economic plan. But Secretary of State Al Haig had other ideas. The State Department had nothing to do with the economy, and Haig had ambitious plans. So, Gergen told me, Haig got a bunch of good press, advocating for intercepting Cuban gun runners (if memory serves). You would think a staunch anti-Communist such as Reagan would have been happy. But, no. Reagan's chief of staff, James Baker, upbraided Haig for diverting media attention away from the primary goal: passing the president's economic plan. I never forgot Gergen's story -- especially when the Clinton White House wandered off message as it tried to pursue fundamental reform of the health care system. The economic plan eclipsed health care for much of Clinton's first year. As did NAFTA. And the crime bill, which included the Brady Bill and other gun control measures. And don't forget gays in the military. And a foreign policy crisis in Somalia -- and another in Haiti. And another in Russia. Clinton gave his health care address to the Congress on September 23, 1993. October was supposed to be ""Health Care Month"" in the White House, but so many other issues got in the way that he had just one public event focused on health care in the entire month -- just one. I understand that Obama's White House team has to juggle a lot of issues; I've been there. And I'm sure the Obama financial reforms have merit. But if the president wants to pass his ambitious health care reform, he's going to have to put other, worthy, ideas on the back burner and shine the media spotlight on the plight of people like Robin Beaton. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.","Paul Begala: Health insurers are depriving some ill people of coverage .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal will meet Andy Murray in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open after beating Ivo Karlovic 6-4 4-6 6-4 6-4. The Spaniard faced a tough challenge as Karlovic, known for his big serve, rained down 28 aces during the match, compared to Nadal's two. However, the world No.2 showed his class by only committing 15 unforced errors, compared to the Croatian's 42. Murray earned his match with Nadal after earlier defeating John Isner 7-6 6-3 6-2. ""Murray is very good, he's one of the most talented players on tour,"" Nadal told the Australian Open Web site when quizzed about their upcoming meeting.

""I thought it was dominated from my side with my serve, which allowed me then to take chance on the return,"" Federer told the Australian Open Web site. ""It was a pretty straightforward match, really. I don't remember him having any breakpoints. He was playing tough from the baseline and making it hard.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Even though Hurricane Alex was headed away from the site of the massive BP oil spill Wednesday, it was affecting containment and collection efforts on multiple fronts, Coast Guard officials said. Alex, upgraded from a tropical storm late Tuesday, was causing heavy seas throughout the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday. That had several major consequences: Oil skimming ships had to return to shore, containment booms were thrown asunder and efforts to burn oil on the surface and break it down through dispersants were put on hold, along with efforts to position a third ship to collect oil at the spill site. ""Until the weather subsides, all we can do is have everything ready to attack and remove this oil once we have weather  that's more conducive,"" said Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft, who delivered a briefing for the Coast Guard on Wednesday. ""We've been held hostage for the last two days due to the prevailing weather,"" he said. Alex -- the first hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season --  was picking up speed and coming ashore in an unpopulated area of northeastern Mexico, some 100 miles south of the Texas border. It is a Category 2 storm with sustained winds of 100 mph. But even though the center of the storm is more than 600 miles from the spill site, it is producing high seas where the oil is located, according to CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers. Winds are 15 to 20 mph at the spill site, producing waves 6 to 8 feet high, he said. That poses a problem for the skimmers,Zukunft said. ""When seas get over 3 feet high, the skimmers become ineffective. They wind up gathering water and not oil,"" he said. More than 500 skimmers, from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, have been forced to return to shore. Also on hold: setting up another ship to contain oil at the spill site. BP has two vessels, the Discoverer Enterprise and the Q4000, that are being used to contain oil. The company had hoped to bring in a third Tuesday called the Helix Producer, which would increase total containment capability to 53,000 barrels of oil per day. But crews need seas of less than 4 feet to make a connection to a coupler below the surface, according to Zukunft. BP now is aiming to complete the job by July 7, he said. The Coast Guard official said the seas also have disrupted containment booms, meant to limit the amount of oil reaching shore. He said officials will be making an aerial survey of the situation Thursday. One thing that has not been affected -- BP's effort to drill relief wells down to the area where oil is leaking. Weather would have to be very severe to affect that, according to Zukunft, and at this point, BP said it is on track to reach the area in August. The storm also is having an impact on where the massive oil spill is flowing. Previously, some oil had been reaching Pensacola Beach in Florida, but the storm's prevailing southeast winds have drawn it more toward the environmentally sensitive Mississippi and Chandeleur sounds, off the coast of Mississippi and Louisiana, Zukunft said. Myers said that's because the storm winds are moving counterclockwise in a huge arc. The strong winds are expected to blow for about three days, pushing the oil back to shore in the area where there already have been dramatic pictures of oil-drenched birds. The Coast Guard briefing came on a day of change for the service branch, as Adm. Thad Allen, who has been overseeing the cleanup effort for the government, officially retired from the Coast Guard. Allen will continue as the national incident commander for the spill, but as a civilian. The move was announced by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who said in a statement, ""I commend Adm. Allen for nearly 40 years of dedicated military service in the Coast Guard. Throughout his career, our nation has turned to Thad Allen for leadership at times of great crisis, and this is one of those times."" She continued, ""Thad Allen has provided excellent leadership as the national commander of our massive response to the largest environmental disaster in our nation's history, and he will continue to leverage his decades of experience in civilian duty as the national incident commander for this spill."" Adm. Robert Papp was sworn in as Coast Guard commandant on May 24, when Allen left the Coast Guard's top post as previously planned, to serve solely as national incident commander on the Gulf spill. Meanwhile, authorities also were busy preparing for future storms. Planners with the Louisiana governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness this week created a hurricane evacuation plan with BP, said the office's director, Mark Cooper. The plan, applicable for the entire hurricane season -- which ends November 30 -- calls for BP's thousands of workers to leave the Louisiana coast at least 16 hours before officials begin evacuating residents. ""We can't have BP blocking our roadways with equipment and personnel,"" said Cooper. It also designates 700 buses to be used only by disabled residents and calls for BP to be back on the scene combating the spill within 72 hours after a hurricane, said Cooper. Researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels (about 1.5 million gallons) and 60,000 barrels (about 2.5 million gallons) of oil are gushing into the gulf every day.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Afghanistan commander whose career ended after a controversial profile in Rolling Stone magazine joked about his predicament and his post-military life at his retirement ceremony Friday in Washington. ""For those here tonight that feel the need to contradict my memories with the truth, remember I was there, too. I have stories on all of you, photos on many, and I know a Rolling Stone reporter,"" Gen. Stanley McChrystal said, poking at the reason for his forced retirement. McChrystal's illustrious career came to an abrupt end when he resigned as the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan after he and his staff were quoted in a Rolling Stone magazine article criticizing and mocking key administration officials. McChrystal collected his medals and verbal commendations from the top men of the military, White House and the Afghanistan ambassador with a bittersweet smile. ""I left a mission I felt strongly about. I ended a career I love that began over 38 years ago. I left unfulfilled commitments I made to many comrades in the fight -- commitments I hold sacred,"" he said. ""My service did not end as I would have wished."" But, McChrystal said, he and his wife, Annie, will approach the future with ""hope and iPhones."" He said the couple had spent some years apart but were now reconnected, aided by new technologies like Skype. The West Point graduate and former Green Beret was a senior official for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the commander of the highly clandestine Joint Special Operations Command, which oversees the military's most sensitive forces, including the Army's Delta Force. ""We say goodbye to Stan McChrystal today with pride and sadness,"" Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said at the ceremony. ""Pride for the remarkable roster of achievement that he has compiled as a man and a soldier. Sadness that our comrade and his prodigious talents are leaving us."" Said Jawad, ambassador of Afghanistan to the United States, thanked McChrystal for what he had done for his country and said ""a number of Afghans would call him a friend."" In 2009, Defense Secretary Robert Gates asked for the resignation of Gen. David D. McKiernan, the former U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan. McChrystal would have ""fresh eyes on the problem"" in Afghanistan, Gates said at the time. President Barack Obama tapped McChrystal in June 2009 to be the top commander in Afghanistan. McChrystal was known for his discretion and keeping the media at arms length. That perception was shattered when the infamous Rolling Stone article came out in June. He did not directly criticize Obama in the article, but reporter Michael Hastings writes that the general and Obama ""failed from the outset to connect"" after the president took office. Sources familiar with their first meeting said McChrystal thought Obama looked ""uncomfortable and intimidated"" by the room full of top military officials, according to the article. The journalist wrote that an unnamed aide to McChrystal mocked Vice President Joe Biden. McChrystal did not deny the article's accuracy. In a statement, he called the comments ""a mistake"" and apologized for ""poor judgment."" McChrystal said that the relationships developed in his career were the most important to him, which he said he would honor with two beer kegs after the ceremony at Fort McNair. He extended the the invitation to everyone present.","NEW: Defense secretary lauds general's talents, service .

"(CNN) -- Jacob Zuma insists the World Cup has already brought South Africa closer together, five days before the tournament begins. The South African president says football fervor has gripped the nation ahead of the opening on game on Friday, which sees South Africa take on Mexico at the Soccer City Stadium in Johannesburg. And Zuma is hoping the month-long competition can have the same benefit for the nation as the Rugby World Cup did in 1995. ""The enthusiasm, joy and excitement that has engulfed the entire nation in recent weeks has not been witnessed since president Nelson Mandela was released from prison [in 1990],"" Zuma told a press conference. ""The explosion of national pride has been a priceless benefit. It's clear that millions of our people look upon this tournament with hope, pride and sense of belonging. ""The South African flag has become the most popular item on the shopping list of South Africans and this augurs well for our nation-building."" The build-up to the World Cup has been dominated by speculation that the host stadiums may not be completed in time, or that the necessary infrastructure may not be in place, but Zuma has declared the country ready to host one of the world's biggest sporting events. ""We are truly pleased and humbled to host the world in our country for this historical and extraordinary event. South Africa is more than ready. For us the World Cup has already begun."" Zuma and FIFA president Sepp Blatter also paid tribute to former South African president Nelson Mandela, and the role he played in securing Africa's first World Cup. ""At this point it is proper for me to acknowledge and thank our founding president and icon, Nelson Mandela, for his visionary leadership and statesmanship,"" said Zuma. ""He also worked hard personally to bring us to this glorious moment. He would love to be there. Whether he will be there on the day depends entirely on the former president..

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States has spent more than $1 trillion on wars since the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, a recently released Congressional report says. Adjusting for inflation, the outlays for conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere around the world make the ""war on terrorism"" second only to World War II. The report ""Cost of Major U.S. Wars"" by the Congressional Research Service attempts to compare war costs over a more than 230-year period -- from the American Revolution to the current day -- noting the difficulties associated with such a task. Since the the 9/11 terror attacks, the United States has spent an estimated $1.15 trillion. World War II cost $4.1 trillion when converted to current dollars, although the tab in the 1940s was $296 billion. World War II consumed a massive 36 percent of America's gross domestic product -- a broad measurement of the country's economic output. The post-9/11 cost of the conflicts is about 1 percent of GDP. Comparisons of costs of wars over a 230-year period, however, are inherently problematic, the report says. ""One problem is how to separate costs of military operations from costs of forces in peacetime. In recent years, the DOD (Department of Defense) has tried to identify the additional 'incremental' expenses of engaging in military operations, over and above the costs of maintaining standing military forces."" ""Figures are problematic, as well, because of difficulties in comparing prices from one vastly different era to another,"" according to the report. ""Perhaps a more significant problem is that wars appear more expensive over time as the sophistication and cost of technology advances, both for military and for civilian activities."" The costs associated with the ""war on terrorism"" could still go much higher. A Congressional Budget Office estimate from 2007 said the cost of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq could total $2.4 trillion by 2017, more than double the current amount. CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this story.","""War on terrorism"" is second most-expensive war in U.S. history, report says .

"(CNN)  -- The news of intense drug-related violence out of Jamaica is shocking and dreadful but entirely predictable. Wherever the war on drugs touches down, death and destruction result. A recent target is Kingston, Jamaica. When law enforcement attempted to smoke out Christopher ""Dudus"" Coke, wanted in the U.S. for conspiracy to distribute marijuana and cocaine and to traffic in firearms, scores of people died in the urban warfare. The death toll reached 73 civilians as Jamaicans were caught in the crossfire between police, soldiers and armed thugs. Rival drug gangs used the confusion to eliminate their enemies and further ratchet up the violence. Coke has since agreed to surrender to officials in New York, because he ""feels it is in his best interest to be taken to the U.S. rather than to a Jamaican jail,"" sources told the Jamaican Observer, but not before scores of people died. Given that the scenes of violence between rival drug gangs are so common, people often fail to consider the factors that fuel this violence. The reality is that Jamaicans are just the latest victims in a misguided and expensive war that has taken countless thousands of lives, from the streets of New York to the slums and shantytowns of Colombia, Mexico and other third-world nations. In more than four decades since former U.S. President Nixon first declared America's ""war on drugs,"" the battles against spreading disease, increasing violence and the ongoing destruction of families and neighborhoods have been lost. Mexico, a country all too familiar with violence as a way of life, is today a stark example of how crackdowns on drug cartels by American and local law enforcement agencies have utterly failed. The horrible drug-related violence in Mexico was intensified by President Felipe Calderón, with strong U.S. support. This crackdown has resulted in about 23,000 drug-related deaths across the country since 2006. The bloodiest war has been fought in Juárez, a besieged city of 1.3 million on the U.S. border, where 5,100 people have been killed since 2008. The global drug war has created a massive illicit market with an estimated annual value of $320 billion. In April, the newly created International Centre for Science in Drug Policy, of which I am founder, released a review of every English-language study to examine the link between drug law enforcement and violence. The review clearly demonstrates that the astronomical profits created by drug prohibition drive organized crime and its related violence. Several studies included in the report suggested that law enforcement's removal of key players from the drug trade, such as Christopher Coke, only creates power vacuums that lead to violent and deadly competition. Many victims are not involved in the drug trade, as today's civilian deaths in Mexico, the U.S. and Kingston's slums illustrate. The war on drugs has generated a lucrative, cash-rich industry that has -- not surprisingly -- lured poverty-stricken participants from throughout the impoverished third world. In West Africa, entire countries, such as Guinea-Bissau, are at risk of becoming ""narco-states"" as Colombian cocaine traffickers employ West African trade routes to distribute cocaine into destination markets in Europe, Russia and the Middle East. Estimates now suggest that 27 percent of all cocaine destined for Europe is transited through West Africa and is worth more than $1.8 billion annually wholesale -- and as much as 10 times that amount at the retail level. Illicit drugs are big business, with the influence and global reach that goes along the ability to create widespread wealth. Another conclusion of the review was the clear evidence that drug law enforcement has failed to reduce the availability of illegal drugs. From a scientific perspective, we must accept that law enforcement will never meaningfully reduce the flow of drugs. Economists know that the drug seizures we see over and over again as part of police photo ops have the perverse effect of making it that much more profitable for someone else to sell drugs. The laws of supply and demand have simply overwhelmed police efforts. With young people reporting that obtaining illicit drugs is easier than getting alcohol or tobacco, the situation could not get much worse. Strong scientific evidence points to the effectiveness of alternative regulatory models established in Portugal, the Netherlands and Switzerland to counter the disastrous consequences of illicit drug use and drug policies. The Cato Institute, a respected U.S. think tank, has released a report on alternative drug policies. Several years ago, Portugal parted ways with the U.S. and decriminalized all drugs so that resources could focus on prevention and treatment of drug use. The report shows Portugal's policies have dramatically reduced HIV rates as drug addiction has been viewed as a health, rather than criminal justice, problem. In addition, Portugal now has the lowest rates of marijuana use in the European Union, with experts suggesting that the health focus has taken some of the glamour out of illegal drugs. Similarly, the de facto regulation of marijuana in the Netherlands and distribution through licensed coffee shops generates tax revenue for the country rather than profits for organized crime. Interestingly, rates of marijuana use in the Netherlands remain far lower than those in the U.S. Consider this against the backdrop of the mayhem in Mexico, much of which is driven by fighting to control the marijuana export industry. The American ""get tough"" approach, although politically popular in certain circles, has failed to achieve its intended objectives: The supply of illicit drugs has increased, the costs of illicit drugs have dropped, and drug purity has risen. The mounting bloodshed in Mexico and the recent mayhem in Jamaica clearly demonstrate that the U.S. is exporting violence, breaking up families and increasing the taxpayer burden to help fight these fruitless battles. Americans themselves are suffering deeply from these misguided policies. It's time to just say no to the war on drugs and to implement science-based alternative policy models that are proving effective in other parts of the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Evan Wood.","Evan Wood: Scores killed in Jamaica in attempt to nab suspected drug lord .

"(CNN) -- Some passengers on a diverted Aeromexico flight finally reached their destination in Seattle, Washington, on Wednesday after spending 16 hours in limbo. The plane was scheduled to fly from Mexico City, Mexico, to Seattle on Tuesday, but was diverted to Portland, Oregon, because of thick fog, said Kara Simonds, a spokeswoman for Portland International Airport. In Portland, the passengers were not allowed to exit the plane for four hours because the airport did not have enough customs agents to process them, according to CNN affiliate KING. KING also reported several passengers became so angry that police boarded the plane and told them to stay there or be arrested. Fire officials tried to calm down the outraged passengers by providing them with burgers from a local fast-food restaurant during their wait, Simonds said. Passengers were then flown back to Mexico City after officials could not solve the issue with customs agents, Simonds said. Seattle residents Mike and Karin Kuntz said they had a good vacation in Mexico, but it went downhill after they tried to get home. ""We had a wonderful time, everything went great. Then the flight home turned into a nightmare,"" Karin Kuntz told KING. ""We just felt like we were hostages -- that we, as passengers, had no rights."" Karin Kuntz said she was concerned about the pilot's fatigue and the safety. ""Can he fly back? Is he logged in? How many hours does he have,"" she said. ""No one seemed to be concerned about putting us back on that plane for all that time and that poor tired pilot."" The couple said they waited in the airport in Mexico City for 10 hours before getting a flight back to Seattle on Wednesday night. It is unclear whether other passengers on the flight were able to get to their destination. Representatives from Aeromexico said they were investigating the situation and issued a statement apologizing for the inconvenience. ""We will seek an explanation about why the customs agents were not available to assist the plane and its passengers in Portland,"" the statement said. ""We will also take appropriate steps to thank the passengers who were inconvenienced by this situation for their patience."" However, the ordeal did not end for the Kuntzes when they reached Seattle. ""They lost one of our bags,"" Mike Kuntz said. It is unclear if other passengers on the flight were able to get to their destination. Representatives from Aeromexico said they were investigating the situation and planned to release a statement.

"Dublin (CNN) -- The day of the Gen. McChrystal mea culpa last week, an Afghan friend of mine, whom we can call Osman, drove from Kandahar city to his native village. A group of Taliban stopped the car and demanded to search Osman and his companions. This search has become a fact of life since the movement re-established its control over villages in Panjwai, a district in Kandahar province. The head of the armed group was the 20-year-old son of Osman's tenant farmer. Not far below a superficial politeness, the young Talib fighter deliberately humiliated someone who, according to Kandahari norms, was his senior. New-generation fighters like the tenant tend to be from the poorer families in their tribes, have little education, have no property and have never held a paying job. The Kalashnikov and motorcycle that come with being a Taliban commander and the moral authority of claiming to be waging a jihad have empowered these tribal outsiders. Ironically, a decade ago, Osman was a senior leader in the original Taliban movement and commanded hundreds of such young men. One of the main themes of the counterinsurgency (COIN) strategy is a ""population focus."" A district like the one where Osman lives is today densely populated, unlike during the Soviet occupation. It sits astride a national highway and is a gateway to Kandahar. It is therefore prioritized as ""key terrain."" According to the ""shape-clear-hold-build"" COIN mantra, NATO is supposed to expel insurgents from Osman's district and 59 other priority areas. It is supposed to help install Afghan civil administration and security forces and leave them to maintain security and practically assist the population. To make this possible, Afghan security force numbers are to be raised to 400,000 and Afghan government legitimacy, responsiveness and accountability are to be boosted. Unfortunately, none of this is going to happen by 2011. Success requires more time and political action than backers have been prepared to contemplate. Osman's encounter with his tenant Taliban gives a clue to the steady supply of insurgent fighters and commanders. Insurgency has become their social niche. Taliban fighters keep on popping up, making good their losses and adapting to the International Security Assistance Force campaign. More global perspectives, images, videos and the latest news at the Afghanistan Crossroads blog . In the face of a resilient insurgency, U.S. and Afghan timelines do not match. The U.S. will review progress against its strategy in late 2010. But at the end of the year, Afghanistan will look pretty much the same as last year, before the surge. The challenge in dealing with the Afghan government is to encourage the good and forbid the evil. But current strategy contains no silver bullets for delivering a government that the population might consider trustworthy or legitimate. Increased awareness of the problems with a ""kleptocratic"" government has not translated into effective measures to clean it up. Moreover, the insurgency is now self-sustaining. Enough protection money leaks from transport, security and construction contracts to finance thousands of the kind of group that stopped Osman. Meanwhile, the U.S. has also found it very difficult to support the government in a way that delivers resources and backup to administrators and officers on the ground. Another challenge, which is more political than military, is that the insurgents are still able to exploit Pakistan as a haven. Groups like the one that stopped Osman alternate between the battlefield and the haven in Pakistani Baluchistan, only eight hours away. What can be done? The first challenge is to get the Afghan leadership and the international allies onto the same script. For example, the Afghan leadership insists on holding parliamentary elections in September, even though everyone else knows they would be disastrous for the counterinsurgency objective of boosting government legitimacy. An election held in conditions in which half of the polling station locations are too dangerous for candidate agents, and indeed voters, to visit is likely to lead to another round of rigging and disputes, undermining the credibility of the parliament. This is the kind of disconnect that needs to be overcome. Likewise, reconciliation with the amenable parts of the insurgency will have to be elevated from the status of show or strategic afterthought to become a serious part of the strategy. The strategy will also require some bright new ideas for getting Pakistan on board. A more realistic strategy would have the work of securing much of the key terrain eventually fall to the Afghan National Security Forces. Before the phased hand-over, NATO will secure main cities but probably only a handful of the current prioritized districts. If the U.S. leadership decides to stay engaged, there will have to be a switch to a longer-term post-surge support strategy with more modest objectives, such as securing the cities and main highways rather than all population centers. Renewed U.S. commitment will generate opportunities to convince some of the insurgent leadership that they have no prospect of toppling the Kabul government and might as well strike a deal. In the best of all possible counterinsurgency worlds, the Taliban leadership would abandon al Qaeda and declare its armed jihad over. However, there is little prospect of anyone signing up to such a deal as long as thousands of fighters expect to ride out a time-limited surge, flitting between Panjwai and Baluchistan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Semple.","Michael Semple says new crop of Afghan Taliban made bold by guns, jihad authority .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The murder of 8-year-old Sandra Cantu in Tracy, California, has brought America's Amber Alert program under the microscope. Sandra vanished in broad daylight on March 27. Surveillance video from that afternoon showed her happily skipping to go play at her friend's house. After she failed to return home, her family alerted the authorities, but an Amber Alert was not issued. Ten days later, Sandra's body was found stuffed inside a piece of luggage in an irrigation ditch near her home. The frantic search for the killer may be over, as police arrested Melissa Huckaby on April 10 and charged her with murder. This horrifying case raises the question -- why didn't police issue an Amber Alert when Sandra vanished? Tracy Police have done an excellent job in this case, but could that have made a difference in saving this girl's life? First, we must examine what an Amber Alert does. According to amberalert.gov, the program is a ""partnership between law-enforcement agencies, broadcasters, transportation agencies, and the wireless industry, to activate an urgent bulletin"" and is saved for ""the most serious child abduction cases."" The goal is to blitz the area with information to spark a community-wide search. Secondarily, the alerts serve as deterrents. Some abductors have actually freed the kidnapped child after hearing or seeing the alert. This happened in California in January when a man abducted an 8-year-old girl. After observing a highway sign broadcasting an Amber Alert for the girl, the suspect dropped the girl off in San Jose before turning himself in to police. In California, where Sandra was murdered, 141 children have been safely recovered as a result of Amber Alerts since 2002, according to the California Highway Patrol. The Amber Alert Web site claims the program has saved more than 430 children nationwide and that in 2007, 80 percent of kids alerted were recovered safely within three days. That is incredibly fast and effective -- two words that aren't often used to describe a government program. With such a high success rate, some may wonder why the program isn't used more frequently. A grisly case like the Sandra Cantu murder only intensifies this debate. The main reason for the limited use of the program is that Amber Alert cases must meet very specific criteria. Otherwise, the alerts will be issued too often, creating a ""boy who cried wolf"" scenario. People will become desensitized and stop taking the alerts seriously. After all, Department of Justice reports about 800,000 missing child cases any given year. Very few of those -- slightly more than 100 -- are stereotypical ""kidnappings."" Over half of the 800,000 are kids who ran away, or simply lost track of time, or are part of custody disputes. But the DOJ's Amber Alert guidelines are designed to focus on those rare abductions by strangers or slight acquaintances. To maintain this focus, the department recommends that Amber Alerts only be issued when the child is at risk of serious injury or death and law enforcement has sufficient descriptive information about the child, abductor or abductor's vehicle. Some argue that Sandra's case met those criteria. But it's easy to Monday-morning quarterback. The fact is, Tracy Police made a swift arrest and should be applauded. They used the full extent of their resources to try to safely recover Sandra, including dispensing an electronic alert to West Coast law enforcement agencies, heading a massive search effort and speaking to the media. We'll never know for sure if an Amber Alert would have saved Sandra's life. Police now say it appears she died before the search even began. Nevertheless, this case does suggest the Amber Alert system can be improved by refining some of the gray areas. For instance, the DOJ has guidelines, but states are free to tweak them. That's why you'll often hear law enforcement in some states say they can't issue an Amber Alert without a vehicle description, while others don't follow that rule. All state law enforcement agencies should have to adhere exactly to one set of rules. The guidelines are supposedly in place to minimize delays and confusion between jurisdictions. Well, you know what would really minimize delays and confusion? A single, uniform system. Secondly, with today's technology, the Amber Alert program must be expanded. We're no longer just talking about highway signs and C.B. radio.

"United Nations (CNN) -- Edward Norton -- Oscar-nominated actor of ""American History X"" and ""Primal Fear"" fame -- is the latest Hollywood star to lend his celebrity status in support of a United Nations cause. Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon named Norton U.N. goodwill ambassador for biodiversity Thursday. ""Edward Norton has brought global star power to global issues -- community development and conservation, causes that are clearly close to his heart,"" Ban said in a statement after appointing Norton. ""It is an issue that I've been engaged with on many different levels for a number of years,"" Norton said at U.N. Headquarters in New York. ""But it's very, very exciting to be asked to engage with it on the level of the U.N. with its incredible capacity and reach."" As opposed to focusing on dated methods of conservation such as setting aside preserved areas of land, Norton said in his new role he would work on addressing human needs, which he said he believes is ""the key to long-term preservation."" ""People have recognized that fragmenting the ecosystems or creating protected pockets is not actually authentic to the way ecosystems work,"" he said. Norton has been an advocate for many causes, recently helping to launch a social networking platform, Crowdrise, aiming to boost global participation in charitable work. He is also a board member of the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust, and ran the New York City Marathon last year, helping to raise over $1 million for the trust and local communities in Kenya supported by the group. As biodiversity goodwill ambassador, he will be ""increasing people's focus on the fact that human well-being is intertwined fundamentally with biodiversity,"" Norton said. ""I think catastrophic events like what's happening in the Gulf with the oil spill do highlight for people that there is enormous ramification for human well-being through a loss of biodiversity,"" Norton said. Norton is also using his creative talents as a filmmaker to raise conservation awareness. He said his company, Class 5 Films, has worked television projects and on a potential feature film with environmental themes. According to the U.N., biodiversity is ""essential in sustaining the living networks and systems that provide the world population with health, wealth and food and fuel."" This year marks the international year of biodiversity for the United Nations. By the end of the year, the U.N. hopes to see a significant reduction in rates of biodiversity loss through practices such as deforestation, excess cultivation and over-fishing that damage the environment and contribute to overall global poverty.","U.N. secretary-general names actor Edward Norton as goodwill ambassador .

"(CNN) -- When our helicopter flew into Port-au-Prince, it almost felt like we were on some silent glide. The sharp sound of the rotor blades faded into background noise. Sound did not rise from the ground. There was not enough traffic or people or life to raise a ruckus. There were no fires burning or that dark energy that rises up from the ground when there is danger in the air. There was silence, people huddling in tents alongside flattened buildings, people sifting slowly through the rubble of their lives, people adrift. We entered Haiti like a lot of the folks entering Haiti, down right nervous. Haiti has a history of horrible acts of violence against its own people and visitors. Journalists have died in Haiti. There are many guns and many vendettas. It's not just that there is an earthquake whose aftershocks could rattle away at what remains. There is an expectation of danger, a question in the air. Will these desperate, disheartened, wounded people rise to violence and theft in the wake of this latest, largest disaster? We landed without incident in the yard of the Dominican Embassy with precious supplies brought in by relief organizations. A CNN convoy laden with water and money and fuel followed us in by land without a hitch. And in the days that followed, we did not see a population breaking into buildings or fighting over scant resources. The Haiti we saw is not a land of fires and violence and looting. This is a land where desperation has been supplanted by despair. Each day, we left our workspace with security people, drivers, big guys that were supposed to help us navigate presumed dangers. They mostly hung out and chatted with kids playing around our cars. They walked us into a huge plaza where a massive tent city had formed. It was so quiet. People just sitting there, holding their children beneath sheets so they aren't burned in the sun. Some mothers are bathing their kids in murky water. There is one remedial medical station beneath a tent. Three medical volunteers with meager supplies tend to the wounds of dozens. Anguished mothers wait patiently with children wounded and wailing. No one complains. No one pushes. One afternoon we happened upon Capital Bank, a building that also housed a Western Union and some local money order services. A flotilla of United Nations folks from Ghana and France and Canada descended with major artillery. A tank, a string of armored cars and high-ranking officials with bright stripes decorating their uniforms rushed around on high alert. They shut down the street as they entered the building and brought out sacks that seemed to be filled with money. Full coverage . When we went to take a picture, they became very agitated. Some of them yelled that we had no business here and pushed us back into the road where the oncoming cars fortunately stopped in time. They were so overwhelming that a female official from Ghana began to laugh at her colleagues. ""Let them take the photo,"" she told a muscular Canadian officer. ""Here,"" he said handing her his walkie talkie. ""You be in charge of this mission."" But the ""mission"" was barely picture worthy. The Haitians ambled by, as the apparent sacks of money were removed for safe keeping. The scene was the same at the building where taxes are collected. A great crane lifted rubble while a crowd watched peacefully. No one seemed to be trying to get into the flattened presidential palace nearby even though there was not much visible security. We also passed gas lines. Gas is the key to so many things right now, powering the car that can get you out of this disaster, running the generator that can turn on your lights or make it possible to call for help on a cell phone. The cars sit quietly, drivers holding their places without a quarrel. We drove around day after day and saw nothing but sad people sweeping their streets of rubble and bodies and wreckage. We drove out to Leogan, the epicenter of the quake, and people calmly moved bananas, sugar cane and water from the fields into tent cities erected in open space. Haiti's missing, found . We saw an organized crowd being handed water bottles from soldiers who flew in from Camp Lejeune. We did not see one gun, except the ones carried by security guards, police officers and soldiers. In Jacmel, two hours south, a group of young Haitians ran around with expensive video cameras documenting the destruction of their hometown, Haiti's cultural capital. They had water flown in by their sponsors as well as food and generators, but no one tried to steal them. The hotels that survived were unguarded but not a soul ventured in to take the furniture or bedding that might have made life in the tent cities more bearable. Haitian doctors staffed the ""hospital,"" a patch of grass outside the real hospital that fell down. Cuban doctors helped them with their work, rationing antibiotics and painkillers. People were in great pain, but no one screamed for help or painkillers. They seemed to think that they were getting whatever was available. The Canadians posted guards at one gate to keep folks from getting to the piers where they brought in supplies, but no one was trying to get in anywhere around this huge dock. They stood in line at distribution centers, grabbed a broom or shovel to help the soldiers clear streets. When the French erected a mobile medical unit, the people formed a peaceful line and repeatedly expressed their gratitude. These are people with injuries that make you gasp. Many amputations have been done by amateurs in bad circumstances. It's hot. No one said a word. We followed the directors of an orphanage as they traveled through some of Port-au-Prince's poorest neighborhoods. They didn't have many supplies, but they wanted to share. No one tried to rob us. A woman broke down in tears begging us to help us find her son. She ignored our bottles of water and food. She just wanted her son. Impact Your World . A few nights later, her orphanage was hit by bandits who didn't take anything, but scared the kids. At another orphanage we visited, bandits struck twice but left both times with nothing. The orphanage director said they left it because they didn't want to steal supplies from children. My colleagues saw a few folks break into places and even captured a few scuffles on tape. But those who have spent a lot of time in Haiti was certain there was no more crime, possibly even less crime, than would visit this city of millions on a regular day. The story of Haiti, at this time, is not one of unending violence, looting and a population angry enough to fight over scant resources. But the people we met were wounded and weary and afraid to go back inside. The earth could shake at any moment and death could visit once again.","Despite desperate times, many Haitians not turning to violence .
Tent cities, makeshift hospitals are new way of life in quake-ravaged country .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Aid intended for Gaza that was unloaded from a Libyan-backed ship in northern Egypt was sitting in storage Saturday, awaiting transfer, according to the governor of North Sinai. The ship from the Gadhafi foundation, a charity headed by the son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, docked in Al Arish and began unloading aid Thursday. However, it was taking time to sort out the medical supplies -- a top priority for delivery -- from other aid, Gen. Morad Mowafe told CNN Saturday. Mowafe expected that the aid would arrive in Gaza by Sunday. The ship reached Egypt after sailing from Greece on July 10 with 2,000 tons of aid. It was the latest ship attempting to breach an Israeli naval blockade of the Palestinian territory of Gaza whose captain was persuaded to dock elsewhere instead. The aid includes food, medicine, and construction materials to be taken from the port to the Gaza border about 25 miles (42 kilometers) away. Israel said it must inspect all goods prior to their entering Gaza to ensure that weapons do not get into the hands of militants. Gaza is run by Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement. The Gadhafi foundation refers to the ship as the Hope, although it appears to be registered as the MV Amalthea. It is Moldovan-flagged and run by ACA Shipping, based in Greece. Israel came under fierce international criticism after Israeli navy commandos boarded a Gaza-bound Turkish aid ship in May and nine people died. Israel said the activists on that ship attacked its troops when they boarded the boat. The Israeli assault on the Turkish ship reverberated internationally and highlighted the Gaza blockade. Israel has resisted demands for an international inquiry into the incident, but an Israeli military investigation into the boarding of the Mavi Marmara criticized some aspects of the operation. CNN's Housam Ahmed contributed to this report.","Supplies from a Libyan-backed ship still being sorted out in Egypt .

"(CNN) -- Communities in northeastern Mexico found themselves flooded and isolated Tuesday as Mexico's National Water Commission tried to manage high levels at area reservoirs due to Hurricane Alex. Servando Lopez Moreno, mayor of Miguel Aleman, Mexico, said that the water commission released water from the nearby El Cuchillo reservoir without warning communities near the river, which flooded homes and crops, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Miguel Aleman is located in the state of Tamaulipas, near the border with Texas. The mayor said his town was not affected directly by Hurricane Alex, but by the lack of coordination between reservoir managers and local officials. He said that the communities of San Antonio de Reyna, Mexico, and Arcabuz, Mexico, faced flooded homes, ruined sorghum crops and disabled work equipment as well as lack of electricity and phone lines, Notimex reported. There were no fatalities in the flooding, the mayor said. He asked for federal and state authorities to intervene to avoid future problems. In the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon, the effects of Alex were more direct. Some 40,000 Nuevo Leon residents were pushed out of their homes because of the storm, authorities said. The state's ministry of health announced an emergency program that includes psychological attention to those affected, Notimex reported. The head of the health department, Jesus Zacarias Villarreal, said the psychological services were for those people with anxiety, nervousness and depression as a result of the storm. Alex stormed onshore as a Category 2 Hurricane on June 30, causing at least six deaths in Nuevo Leon.","River rose because of water released from reservoir .

"(The Frisky) -- It didn't start out this way, but I'm in a long-distance relationship. Having your boyfriend live 1,300 miles away isn't ideal, but as far as problems in relationships go, things could be much worse: He could be in Australia or I could have caught him cheating on me with various tattooed women after I won an Academy Award and adopted a baby. So, this isn't some sappy, romantic article on ways to ""Survive Your Long-Distance Relationship."" Here's the real problem: a third party has entered my relationship, causing fights, miscommunication and anxiety. She's sleek, sexy and smooth. Her name is ... the iPhone 3G. When your beloved lives a plane ride away, the phone becomes your main source of staying connected, but iPhone -- you are making this a challenge ... am I just supposed to turn the other cheek because you are an otherwise wonderful multi-media device? Both my boyfriend and I have an iPhone. For those of you who are owners, you know it is notorious for dropping calls, having terrible reception, and overall, they're really awesome for playing Plants vs. Zombies and Sudoku, but for actual phone use, my five-pound Motorola from 1997 worked better. In all seriousness, these technical difficulties have either caused arguments or added to an already tense moment. For instance, the other day we were having a little argument over GChat, when he all of the sudden logged off -- which, in instant messaging terms, is the equivalent of hanging up the phone or getting the door slammed in your face. OH. NO. HE. DIDN'T. But apparently, he had logged off to call me, and my phone didn't even ring. He's thinking, ""What the hell, pick up the phone!"" This goes on for a while, until I get a ""voicemail"" notification that he called. I tried calling him back, but none of the phone calls would go through. The final blow was when I got a delayed text from him saying: ""I tried to call you. Where did you go?"" AHHH! Eventually, we managed to reach each other and everything was totally fine, but if it weren't for our iPhones, those two hours of anxiety would have never happened. Because so many people have been complaining about the poor service, AT&T has introduced a reception tower to place in your home or office that amps up your reception. Initially, I thought: Yes! A solution! But then the bitterness set in. Let me get this straight: I not only paid $300 for a ""superior"" phone, I also shell out over $100 a month in fees. Now you want me to fork over another $150 so I can get service? I'm insulted. I'm still undecided on what to do. I know there is Skype and video chatting, among other sources of technological-aided communication, but I'm stubborn, and I want to be able to call my boyfriend when I want to. It's a simple request. So, I guess -- deep in my heart -- I know the solution: I just have to wait for the iPhone 4G to come out. I'm sure that will solve everything.

"(CNN) -- International observers Monday applauded the first free presidential election in Guinea in more than 50 years, saying it was democratic, inclusive and transparent. ""This is the first time since independence that the people of Guinea have had a chance to be regarded as human beings politically, to express themselves politically,"" said Carter Center official John Stremlau, who is in the west African nation as a monitor. ""The people were given the opportunity and conducted themselves on election day with dignity, in an orderly and peaceful way,"" said Stremlau, the vice president of the Carter Center's peace programs and co-leader of its election observation mission. Results should be available Wednesday, and will almost certainly show a runoff will be required, said Deborah Hakes of the Carter Center. Voters came out in large numbers, they were enthusiastic and often showed great patience, the Carter Center said in a statement. Counting of ballots was transparent, in full view of everyone at polling stations, it added. The country has been ruled by a series of authoritarian and military dictators since it gained independence from France, its former colonial master, in 1958. The most recent coup came in December 2008, the day after the death of longtime President Lansana Conte, who himself seized power in 1984. Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara led the 2008 coup and promised elections and the introduction of civilian rule, but by the following summer it seemed clear that he planned to run for president himself, according to the U.S. State Department. The opposition organized a protest against him in a stadium in the capital Conakry in September 2009, but the military attacked the demonstrators. At least 150 people were killed, more than 100 were raped and at least 1,000 were injured, according to the U.S. government and international human rights groups. At least 100 bodies were never found, Human Rights Watch said. Camara was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt by an aide in December 2009, and flown abroad for medical treatment. He survived, but agreed not to return to the country. Minister of Defense Brig. Gen. Sekouba Konate became interim president, paving the way for the elections Sunday. Twenty-four candidates are running for president, including four former prime ministers, according to Human Rights Watch, which has been cautiously optimistic about the vote. ""The Defense Ministry's promise to keep the military in barracks during the election period, and to back whoever wins is a very positive sign,"" Human Rights Watch said Friday. ""A successful, credible election could finally end over 50 years of authoritarian and abusive rule,"" the activist group said. ""The new president and government will have their work cut out for them,"" HRW's Corinne Dufka said. ""They should waste no time addressing the deep-rooted causes of years of crisis -- endemic corruption, impunity, crushing poverty, and the inequitable distribution of natural resource wealth."" The country's electoral officials, cell phone companies and U.S. embassy have worked together to set up a system where voters can send text messages if they see voter fraud or intimidation, U.S. Ambassador Patricia Newton Moller said. Guinea, a country of about 10 million people, has rich reserves of bauxite, an important aluminum ore -- possibly as much as half the world's reserves, according to the State Department. It also has gold and diamond mines, and grows rice, coffee, bananas, pineapples and palm products.","Voting democratic and inclusive, Carter Center says .

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- A Sri Lanka politician ended his ""fast unto death"" on Saturday when the nation's president gave him water and an ambulance rushed him to a hospital. Wimal Weerawansa, who had been the construction minister and is currently a member of parliament, was on his fourth day of the fast amid protests against the United Nations. He said he would go without food until U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon dissolves a three-member panel looking into human rights abuses in the final stages of a decades-long war that ended in 2009 between the government and the Tamil Tiger rebels. During the fast, Weerawansa's Cabinet colleagues visited him in a special tent outside the U.N. compound in Colombo. He was on a mattress on a specially-constructed dais protected by plain-clothed security. Visits by ministers signaled government backing for Weerawansa's protest against the United Nations. Doctors warned Weerawansa earlier Saturday that his condition was worsening and administered saline to him. President Mahinda Rajapaksa walked up the dais and gave a bottle of water to Weerawansa. He was then taken to a hospital. The event was shown on local TV and has been widely reported. The United Nations and other countries have expressed dismay at the blockade of the U.N. compound and Weerawansa's leading role in the protest. The U.N. office continued to function with limited staff. The United Nations has been concerned about accountability issues related to the rebels' defeat, including alleged war crimes by troops and rebels -- allegations that both parties deny. Weerawansa has said Ban intends to bring the Sri Lankan president before a war crimes tribunal. ""We will not allow that to happen,"" Weerawansa told a news conference earlier in the week. Weerawansa resigned his ministerial portfolio yesterday on Friday, but government sources say he will be sworn in again.","Former Cabinet member ends 'fast unto death'

"(CNN) -- The man who pleaded guilty in the failed Times Square car bombing said before the incident that the strike would be a ""revenge attack,"" according to an airing Wednesday on an Arabic-language TV network. Al Arabiya showed what it said was a tape of Pakistani-American Faisal Shahzad, who pleaded guilty in June to the attempt. The authenticity of the tape could not immediately be verified, and the person in the video appeared sometime before the May 1 event. The comments, made in English, were translated into Arabic for the news report. He said the ""revenge attack"" will be carried out ""in the name of all the mujahedeen, the fighters and the weak and the oppressed Muslims,"" he said, mentioning Baitullah Mehsud and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and Muslims and Arabs who have been martyred. ""I will take revenge on their behalf, inshallah, and I really wish that the hearts of the Muslims will be pleased with this attack inshallah."" Mehsud was the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, and al-Zarqawi headed al Qaeda in Iraq. ""Eight years have passed with the war in Afghanistan and you will see that the war of the Muslims has just started, and we will show you how Islam will spread throughout the whole world."" The speaker stressed that ""jihad"" is a prominent pillar of Islam, a term often used to mean ""holy war."" ""By jihad, Islam is established, Allah's word is made superior,"" he said. ""By abandoning jihad, may Allah protect us from that, Islam is destroyed and Muslims fall into inferior positions. Their honor is lost, their lands are stolen. Their rule and authority vanish. Jihad is an obligated duty in Islam on every Muslim. "" He said Islam will spread across the world. He said democracy will be defeated as communism was. ""All the other -- isms and -- schisms will be defeated and the word of Allah will be supreme, inshallah. And Muslims are gonna do that.""","Arabic-language TV network shows what it says is a tape of Faisal Shahzad .

"Gulu, Uganda (CNN) -- Mwaka Posiano trekked for miles to watch the World Cup on television -- a first for the teen born in rebel captivity during the decades-long insurgency in Uganda. ""I now know how Robihno and (Didier) Drogba look,"" Mwaka said with a beaming smile, referring to top players from Brazil and Ivory Coast, respectively. ""I have seen how they play and run, I want to play like Robinho."" Mwaka was among about 40,000 mostly-war victims who gathered to watch the World Cup. MTN, the official mobile sponsor of the event, held a public screening in Gulu town in northern Uganda. Before watching the game Sunday, Mwaka and other youth would huddle around a radio in his village to listen to commentaries. ""We'd rush out of school to ... listen on various radios tuned loudly in shops and quite often we'd find the match in second half,"" he said. Mwaka, an AIDS orphan, is one of thousands of children rescued from rebel captivity. They tell chilling stories of atrocities experienced in the hands of the rebel Lord's Resistance Army and government forces, who have been battling for the past 23 years. LRA rebels say they are fighting the government for the establishment of a democracy based on the Bible's Ten Commandments. But for a moment, albeit briefly, all that is forgotten as the 14-year-old and his peers watch their sports heroes. They don't have televisions or radios at home. Neighbors with radios only tune in to select matches to save batteries. ""So we were not following it well, our teachers would update us of results every morning,"" Mwaka said. Soccer is a big sport in Africa -- as big as the NFL is in American households. The English premier leagues are especially popular, with boisterous crowds gathering faithfully in city bars to watch games during the season. This year's World Cup -- the first on African soil -- has sparked a fierce patriotism in the continent. But millions who lack access to radio or television have not shared in the excitement. Intermittent power outages common in Africa add to the woes, forcing financially-struggling residents to watch the games in bars, restaurants and make-shift video halls. ""I have a TV, but I have not watched a single full screening of any game since the World Cup kicked off, mainly due to power cuts,"" said Ben Ochien, 31. ""I spend Shs 500 (about 5 U.S. cents) per match to follow World Cup in video halls ... (that) have generators. In a country where the average person survives on less than two dollars a day, the money can add up. The MTN viewing party helped bridge the gap and allowed others to be part of a historic global event. Rural areas are becoming more stable, and as a result are getting more populated, said Dean M. Ravizza, a professor at Salisbury University in Maryland, who was in the area with students on research. This means a large segment of the population is left out during historic events. ""Unfortunately, access to viewing the events that unfold in the World Cup is not much different,"" Ravizza said. In Gulu, the celebration brought a rare moment of unity -- a crowd gathered for a common goal. ""It allowed many of the war victims and their tormentors -- some I know (former rebels) -- to get united in excitement,"" said Luke Obongmin, 42, a truck driver. Ravizza, a professor in the Department of Health and Human Performance, said such events help facilitate conflict resolution and participation. ""Facilitators of sport programs can use teachable moments of conflict in sports to practice strategies for resolution,"" he said. ""These strategies can then be applied to other areas of their homes, school and community to promote peace within the region."" Most in the crowd, including Mwaka, walked as far as 9 miles (15 kilometers) to watch the game. ""Few who could afford jumped on trucks -- the main form of transport -- and a majority have trekked,"" Obongmin said. The MTN advertised the opportunity by various ways, including drivers circling villages announcing using loudspeakers, a common way of communication in remote areas in Africa. Most people spend Sundays cultivating on their farms, but they came in to share in the excitement, the truck driver said. After the match, Obongmin loaded 40 people in his truck -- all headed to a nearby shopping center, where they would be dropped off to make the trek home. Obongmin started his truck and waved. The noisy chatter of the passengers could be heard over the roaring engine.","About 40,000 mostly-war victims gather to watch World Cup .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Five Americans arrested on terror charges in Pakistan have been sentenced to at least 10 years in prison, the deputy prosecutor general said Thursday. The men, dubbed the ""D.C. Five,"" will also have to pay a fine of 75,000 Pakistani rupees ($878), public prosecutor Nadim Cheema said. They have the right to appeal to the Lahore High Court, he said. Each man was sentenced to 10 years for criminal conspiracy and five years on an anti-terrorism charge, specifically contributing to a banned organization for the purpose of conducting terrorist attacks, Deputy Prosecutor General Rana Bukhtar Ali said. It was not immediately clear whether the sentences must be served concurrently or consecutively. Cheema said the court had seen strong evidence such as incriminating e-mails and the suspects' confessions. The five Americans -- Ahmed Abdullah Minni, Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, Waqar Hussain Khan and Ramy Zamzam -- used to worship together at a mosque in Alexandria, Virginia, until they went missing in November and turned up in Pakistan. They were arrested in December in Sargodha, about 120 miles south of Islamabad, after their parents in the United States reported them missing. Pakistani authorities have described the men as college students intent on waging a holy war against ""infidels for the atrocities committed by them against Muslims around the world."" The men had said they were innocent and claimed they were tortured in jail. They pleaded not guilty to the charges, according to their attorney, Hassan Dastgir Katchela. CNN's Thomas Evans contributed to this report.","Five jailed for 10 years for criminal conspiracy, five years on anti-terrorism charge .

"(CNN) -- Call it a ""message in a bottle"" or an epic eco-adventure -- but now after 8,000 nautical miles and nearly four months at sea, you can finally call it over. After sailing through brutal southern storms and battling numerous technical challenges, the crew of ""Plastiki"" -- a ship made out of thousands of plastic bottles -- is now on its final leg of a trip across the Pacific Ocean. ""It feels amazing,"" Plastiki's expedition leader, David de Rothschild, told CNN Sunday. ""I think what's happened with the Plastiki has really captured the world's imagination... the impact has really surpassed my expectations."" The Plastiki will reach Sydney, its final destination, Monday morning -- ending a 125-day journey, but also completing years of planning and dedication for the team. De Rothschild said that a 2006 United Nations report on plastic littering the world's oceans was his personal catalyst for action. Made of approximately 12,500 reclaimed plastic bottles and engineered using the most sustainable methods possible, the Plastiki is meant to be used as a platform upon which solutions to the myriad of environmental problems can be found. ""I was inspired to go out and really build Plastiki to showcase waste as a resource,"" said de Rothschild. ""And here we are nearly four years to the day just pulling in to a little harbor just north of Sydney, ready to sail in tomorrow [Monday]."" The Plastiki's arrival in Sydney will not, however, be the 60-foot catamaran's first time to reach Australian soil. Winter storms producing near-hurricane strength winds forced the vessel and its crew to take refuge in Mooloolaba, Queensland, on July 19. Brutal winter storms in the Tasman Sea made the leg from New Caledonia the most challenging. One night, winds gusting over 60 knots surprised the crew, leaving them battling to prevent the mast buckling and losing the sail for eight hours. Co-skipper of the boat, Dave Thomson, called the waves some of ""the biggest you're likely to see."" Once in Sydney, the Plastiki will be harbored at the Australian National Maritime Museum. It will remain on display for a month as crew members hold special events aimed at raising awareness of plastic waste in the ocean. The general public will also have the opportunity to visit the vessel during an open day. But de Rothschild said that although the boat is made of recyclable material, he's not planning to toss it in the chipper just yet. ""I really feel the Plastiki is entering its next chapter,"" said de Rothschild, outlining hopes to put the boat on display around the world. ""The plan is to create a global oceans exhibit that can showcase not only the issue of throw-away plastics but really about nurturing and re-evaluating our oceans... our most precious of ecosystems,"" he added. ""The Plastiki is definitely not coming to a halt.""","Plastiki will end 4-month, 8,000-nautical-mile journey in Sydney .

Small to moderate-size tar balls continue to wash up on some beaches of south Walton County, but the impact has been isolated and all 15 beach communities remain open, according to the Walton County Tourist Development Council's website. Meanwhile, small scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach, but the beaches are open and the swimming is still safe, the area's visitors bureau website said. ""Our sugary white sand beaches are open for the enjoyment of our guests and, as of now, we are seeing only intermittent impact,"" according to the bureau. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . The beaches of Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key are open for swimming, but sporadic tar balls and a milky sheen have been reported on Perdido Key, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""Skimmer vessels respond to reports of oil sightings as needed. In addition, clean-up crews will be working on beaches at night when temperatures are cooler,"" the bureau's website said. iReport: A slick trip to Perdido Key . Last week, the Escambia County Health Department rescinded a health advisory that had been issued for beaches stretching from the Florida-Alabama border to the entrance of the Perdido Unit of the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Government officials said that there was no oil sheen or oil slick observed in the water from the high-water mark out to 100 yards from shore. Dime-size to 5-inch tar balls continue to wash up in widely scattered areas of northwest Florida, but all of the state's beaches remain open, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. But several spots have been affected by the oil spill. On Santa Rosa Island, a clean-up was under way where light mousse -- a frothy oil-water mixture -- made landfall. Significant tar balls washed ashore near Opal Beach and oil sheen was approaching Opal's shoreline. ""Response efforts include the constant surveillance for oil on the water,"" the website said. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama, have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""The beaches are open and visitors are still welcome to sunbathe and walk the beach, but we strongly suggest they swim in a pool or enjoy our many off-beach activities,"" the site said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. Grand Isle, Louisiana . The oil's biggest impact in Louisiana is on the portion of the coast from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east, according to a state emergency website. ""Most of the Louisiana Gulf Coast, 70 percent, is unaffected by the oil spill and remains open for commercial and recreational fishing,"" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website. Grand Isle has closed its public beach, the site said.","All of Florida's beaches are open, including tourist hot spots Panama City and Pensacola .

"(CNN) -- As oil began approaching the coast of the United States, environmental scientists said the effects of the spill in the Gulf of Mexico could have ecological and biological consequences for years, if not decades. The intricate ecosystem is a major source of seafood for the United States and hundreds of species of animals and plants are at risk, experts said. Some areas in the path of the slick are particularly sensitive to problems because unlike the rocky coast of Alaska hit by oil from the Exxon Valdez disaster, much of the coastline that will be hit by the BP spill consists of marshy areas where the water is calmer and more difficult to clean. The marshes are in extreme danger, said a biologist with the University of Houston who studies coastal wetlands. ""It's likely going to persist for decades because it will get into the marsh where there is very little wave action and the soil is oxygen poor,"" said Steve Pennings. ""The immediate acute impact might not be that severe because there is not much oil getting to a certain spot, but because the oil might stick around [in the sediment] for 20 years you might have a real chronic effect."" The oil spill started April 20 after an explosion on the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven oil-rig workers remain missing and are presumed dead. The rig sank April 22 about 50 miles off the southeast coast of Louisiana and the untapped wellhead is gushing oil into the Gulf. About 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion, the Coast Guard said. Wetlands in Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states were already struggling because of sea-level rise and the lack of sediment due to some rivers being channelized, Pennings said. Mike Beck, senior scientist on the global marine team for the Nature Conservancy, said there is a lot of concern for oyster reefs, which were also already suffering. Only 15 percent of the world's oyster reefs remain because of over-harvesting and dredging, he said, and hurricanes have also destroyed some reefs. He said there have been some oil spills in Europe that provide clues as to what might happen. ""What we have learned from other accidents is we've seen mortality and then we have seen lower growth rate,"" he said, ""so that even if they're not killed, you are likely to have much lower [population] growth. We're not likely to be able to eat those oysters for quite some time because ... they hold heavy metals in their tissue."" He estimated that the damage to the reefs could last two to five years, but that other oil spills have shown that in some instances it can be longer than that. Beck pointed out that 40 percent of the U.S. seafood supply comes from the northern Gulf of Mexico and 95 percent of the species in the seafood harvest are dependent on the health of the nation's estuaries and marshes. Environmentalist Richard Charter of the Defenders of Wildlife organization said the size of the oil spill will be overwhelming to cleanup crews. ""This event is a self-feeding fire,"" Charter said. ""It is so big and expanding so fast that it's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective. ... You're looking at a long-term poisoning of the area. Ultimately, this will have a multidecade impact."" Some officials worried the destruction could surpass the Exxon Valdez disaster of 20 years ago. That oil tanker ran aground on the Bligh Reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989 and spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil. The surface oil from the Exxon Valdez spill had largely disappeared within three years of the spill, according to studies conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Response and Restoration. The 1997 report said that what oil did remain could be found on beaches that were near still water. The residual oil was not nearly as toxic as the oil studied in the days after the spill. The report said ""intertidal species can tolerate its presence even though it can accumulate in their tissues."" However, a 2003 study published in the journal Science disputed the NOAA finding of toxicity and said that oil in the sediment was still harming the species more than a decade after the accident. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustees Council also disagreed. A spokeswoman told the Anchorage Daily News last year that oil in some parts of the sound is still toxic. All the scientists CNN spoke to said that the long-term impacts of the spill depend on how much oil reaches the coast. The choppy seas are hindering containment efforts, experts said. ""The question is -- we rarely clean up more than 15 or 20 percent of a spill on a calm day, and we aren't seeing a calm day,"" Charter said. The impact will also depend on what states are hit. Beck said there are two major loop currents and one runs along the Louisiana wetlands past Mississippi and Alabama then down the coast of Florida and around the Keys. ""Eventually that water moves out into the Caribbean and the Atlantic,"" he said, indicating the East Coast needs to pay attention to where the oil is traveling.","Oil might remain in the sediment of a marsh for 20 years .
Oyster reefs are immediately in danger and population recovery may be stunted by lingering oil .
Only about 15 to 20 percent of oil can be recovered from water .

"(CNN) -- The West Virginia coal mine where 29 miners died in an explosion in April had a sudden and large inundation of methane gas the day of the accident, the mine owner said Thursday. The level of methane -- an explosive gas -- was almost three times greater than normal, Massey Energy Company said. It is still too early to determine what caused the April 5 explosion, but the methane gas data is a ""very important piece of evidence"" in the ongoing investigation, said Christopher Schemel, a leading explosions expert and a member of the investigation team. Investigators tested data from the mine's primary ventilation exhaust fan and found the unexpected release of gas was intense and overwhelmed the normal safety systems, the company said. ""To put it in perspective, a methane release of this size would completely fill a 2,000 square-foot house with an explosive atmosphere in under 40 seconds, and could fill the volume of a typical mine entry to explosive levels in under 25 seconds,"" Schemel said. The explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine in Naoma, about 30 miles south of Charleston, was the industry's worst disaster in 40 years. The investigation since then has focused on the mine's poor safety record and Massey's response to problems in the past. A preliminary report on the disaster by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration found that the Upper Big Branch mine had ""a significant history of safety issues"" and that the agency was closely monitoring Massey Energy. In 2009, federal inspectors issued 515 citations and orders at the Upper Big Branch mine, with 39 percent of them for ""significant and substantial"" violations. More than 50 of the citations were for problems that the operators knew about but had not corrected, according to federal mine safety records. Thirty-one men were working in the mine when the explosion happened on a Monday afternoon. Most of the blast victims were working in an area where long wall cutting was taking place. The technique uses a large grinder to extract the coal and creates large amounts of coal dust and methane gas, both of which are explosive. Recovery crews found some of the bodies in a section of the mine where readings showed high levels of gases, and the crews needed breathing gear to enter, said Jama Jarrett, spokeswoman for the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training. Rescuers had to use high-pressure fans to pull the toxic air through holes to the surface. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","NEW: The explosion was the mining industry's worst disaster in 40 years .

"(CNN) -- Three New Jersey teenagers who allegedly videotaped the beating death of an immigrant from El Salvador and showed the recording to friends have been charged with the man's murder, authorities said. Khayri Williams-Clark, 18; Nigel Dumas, 19; and an unidentified 17-year-old minor were all charged with the murder of Abelino Mazariego, 47, the Union County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement Tuesday. Williams-Clark is being held on $100,000 bail and Dumas is being held on $250,000, authorities said. The minor is being kept in a juvenile detention center, the prosecutor's office said. The fatal beating occurred on the evening of Sunday, July 17, the prosecutor's office said. According to investigators, Mazariego was sitting on a bench in an upscale neighborhood park area in Summit, New Jersey, when he was approached by the teenagers. The three allegedly attacked Mazariego and recorded the assault with a cell phone camera. ""Without getting into too much detail, it was videotaped and showed amongst teenagers in town,"" spokesman John Holl of the Union County Prosecutor's Office told CNN. ""There were people in town who heard about it, who saw it and that was reported to officers."" The beating appears to have been unprovoked, the prosecutor's statement said. Mazariego was taken to Overlook Hospital in Summit, but he never regained consciousness and died July 19. The Union County medical examiner determined the death was due to brain injuries sustained in the assault, the prosecutor's office said. Residents of Summit are invited to attend a peace and reconciliation service Wednesday evening, according to the city's website. Participants will gather at city hall and walk to the site where Mazariego was attacked, where they will leave flowers. ""Summit is a community that neither expects nor will ever accept violence against any of its citizens, and the murder of this hard-working father and husband is a tragedy that is deeply felt throughout the community,"" a statement on the website said. Meanwhile, a registered nurse at Overlook Hospital has been charged with theft after allegedly stealing several hundred dollars from Mazariego while he was being treated in the emergency room, the prosecutor's statement said. ""The night of the attack coincided with Mazariego's regular payday and family members informed police that roughly $640 was missing from his wallet,"" the prosecutor's office said.

"(CNN) -- A popular sightseeing destination in Australia is boldly going where no tourist attraction has gone before -- by offering audio tours in the Klingon language. Starting August 22, Star Trek fans and those who are fluent in Klingon can visit the Jenolan Caves National Park and take a self-guided audio tour in Klingon through the ""Nettle Cave."" Currently offering audio tours in eight languages, Nettle Cave is part of one of the oldest cave systems in the world and has about 150,000 to 200,000 visitors annually, making it one of the most visited caves in Australia. ""We thought it would be neat to add another language, perhaps a fictional one,"" says David Hay in charge of Cultural Initiatives at Jenolan Caves. ""We considered adding dwarfish or elfish, but then decided to add the second most spoken fictional language in the world after Esperanto, which is Klingon."" How to speak Klingon . Hay says the language addition isn't completely out of the blue. In the early 1990s, two writers of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" visited the caves and decided to name a transport vessel, the USS Jenolan, in the 1992 episode, ""Relics."" In July, two Klingon scholars -- Michael Roney Jr. and Tracy Canfield -- visited the caves from the United States and translated the current English audio tour of the caves into Klingon and recorded it in a Sydney studio. Speaking in the Star Trek language, Roney exclaimed ""lH, qar'a'""? when he first visited the caves to express their beauty, according to a statement released by Jenolan Caves Reserve Trust. The Klingon language was first created in 1979 for ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture."" by James Doohan, who played Scotty in the sci-fi series. Star Trek producers later consulted linguist Mark Okrand to develop the language for ""Star Trek III: The Search for Spock"" and subsequent other films. The ""Klingon Dictionary"" created by Okrand went on to sell hundreds of thousands of copies over the years. Currently, the Klingon Language Institute has an estimated 2,500 members in 50 countries. ""What I think is happening is that people are very interested in the language and we have created a portal into it,"" says Hay. ""This is an opportunity for others to listen to Klingon and make it available for those who interested in it.""","Star Trek fans and those fluent in Klingon can take an audio tour in the language .

"PLACERVILLE, California (CNN) -- A California couple charged with a combined 29 felony counts in connection with the kidnapping and rape of Jaycee Dugard appeared in court for a bond hearing Monday. Phillip and Nancy Garrido appear in court in Placerville, California, on Monday. Phillip and Nancy Garrido, wearing red jail coveralls, were flanked by their attorneys. They appeared to glance at each other only briefly. Phillip Garrido wore a bandage on the side of his nose. The Garridos are accused of kidnapping Dugard in 1991, when she was 11, and keeping her in a well-hidden compound behind their home in Antioch, California, for 18 years. Phillip Garrido fathered two children with Dugard during her captivity, authorities have said. The couple had been held without bail, but Phillip Garrido's defense attorney requested that bail be set for him Monday. El Dorado County Superior Court Judge Douglas Phimister set his bond at $30 million.  Watch the Garridos at the hearing » . However, El Dorado County District Attorney Vern Pierson told reporters after the hearing that Garrido, a registered sex offender, is also on a ""parole hold,"" which carries no bond. A parole hold is placed on people on parole or under supervision when they are taken back into custody. Nancy Garrido's attorney told Phimister that she was not contesting her no-bond status, although she might ask that bond be set in the future. Both defense attorneys told the judge they wanted to make clear that their clients are invoking the right to counsel and do not want to be questioned. Phimister noted that ""other agencies"" are interested in interviewing the couple. Phillip Garrido will undergo a psychiatric evaluation, a common step for defendants. Nancy Garrido's attorney said he was attempting to schedule one for her as well. The two defendants spoke only once, answering ""Yes,"" when asked by the judge if they were willing to waive their right to a preliminary hearing within 60 days. Both Garridos previously pleaded not guilty to the charges. They face a combined 29 felony counts; 26 counts name only one of them -- 13 for each -- and both are named in three. Phillip Garrido was convicted of kidnapping and raping a woman in 1976, and was released from prison after serving 10 years of a 50-year sentence. He was required to register as a sex offender and placed on lifetime parole. Pierson acknowledged Monday that ""very legitimate questions"" have been raised about Garrido's release and supervision. ""Those are issues which I'm confident will be addressed in a proper venue at a proper time,"" he said. But Pierson praised Garrido's current parole officer for helping to bring about his capture, breaking through his ""elaborate, well-planned cover story that was 18 years in the making."" The parole officer summoned Garrido to his office after being tipped off by University of California-Berkeley police, who considered Garrido suspicious and questioned why he was on campus with two young girls. Those girls later were shown to be his daughters by Dugard. As for Dugard and her family, Pierson released no details but said he echoed earlier comments, made by family spokeswoman Tina Dugard, that all family members are doing well under the circumstances. Professionals have been brought in to assist the family, he said. Pierson pleaded with reporters to exercise ""basic human decency"" and leave Dugard's family in peace. ""What this family has been through ... they have a lot to deal with right now,"" he said. Asked about a possible statute of limitations on the Garridos' alleged crimes, Pierson said it was complicated, but prosecutors have examined the issue and ""we're confident we're not going to have a problem in this case."" He said he did not know whether a grand jury would be convened in the case, and did not rule out additional charges against the Garridos. He would not speculate on when the two might stand trial, saying, ""in a perfect world, the criminal justice system would move much more quickly than it does."" Both the Garridos, if convicted, would face ""multiple life terms,"" he said. After the couple was arrested in August, investigators used cadaver dogs to search their ramshackle home and the surrounding rural property for a possible connection to unsolved crimes. A bone fragment that is ""probably human"" was found near the Garridos' home, a sheriff's spokesman said September 8. The bone was found early in September on a neighbor's property in an area to which Phillip Garrido had access. The fragment, which was analyzed by an outside expert, will go on to the state DNA lab for testing, according to an e-mail from Jimmy Lee, director of public affairs for the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office. ""The expert has determined that the bone fragment found in the backyard of Garrido's neighbor is probably human,"" Lee said. ""We will be requesting the state to see if it can develop a DNA profile on the fragment. It should be noted that it is not uncommon to find Native American remains in Contra Costa County,"" he said. Police in Hayward, California, are trying to determine whether Garrido is linked to the 1988 kidnapping of Michaela Garecht, Hayward Police Lt. Chris Orrey said earlier this month. Garecht and Dugard were of similar age and appearance, both were abducted in daylight, and a sketch of a suspect resembled Garrido, Orrey said. In Dublin, California, investigators said earlier this month they were looking into whether Garrido was connected to the 1989 disappearance of Ilene Misheloff, who was 13 when she was abducted. Garrido was convicted of kidnapping and raping Katie Callaway Hall in 1976. He was released from prison after serving 10 years of a 50-year sentence. He was labeled a sex offender and put on lifetime parole. CNN's Dan Simon and Rob Ade contributed to this report.","NEW: DA doesn't expect statute of limitation to be a problem in prosecuting case  Bail set for Phllip Garrido but ""parole hold"" means he can't be released .

"(CNN) -- The Czech Republic has apologized for a controversial art installation it commissioned to mark its six-month presidency of the European Union. David Cerny attends the 'Entropa' exhibit with Czech Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra. The work, ""Entropa,"" frames various representations of each member state as components of a giant multimedia model kit. With Bulgaria depicted as a Turkish toilet and Romania as a vampire theme-park, the work by Czech artist David Cerny has provoked an angry response from some member states. Betina Joteva, spokesperson for Bulgaria's permanent representation to the EU, said in comments reported by EUObserver.com: ""It [the work] is preposterous, a disgrace. It is a humiliation for the Bulgarian nation and an offence to [our] national dignity.""  Look at images of European nations » . At the official unveiling of the work at the EU headquarters in Brussels Thursday, Alexandr Vondra, Czech Deputy Prime Minister for EU affairs, said: ""Entropa is a provocation of a kind. I understand that some could feel offended and I would like to apologize to them. This does not just concern Bulgaria but any other member state. ""I would also like to apologize to all those whom I have unintentionally misled, among other media representatives and my colleagues from the Permanent Representation of the Czech Republic in Brussels. If Entropa was supposed to make fun of someone, that would be us, me in the first place."" Bulgaria is not the only nation to suffer an unflattering depiction. What do you think about images? Germany is criss-crossed by a series of autobahns in what some critics say is a close approximation of a swastika; Spain is a giant construction site in a dig at its building boom; and Luxembourg is a gold covered nugget sporting a ""For Sale"" sign. The Netherlands is depicted as a submerged land with only minarets peeking through the waves in an apparent reference to its religious tensions. Poland recreates the WWII flag-raising at Iwo Jima, only with the U.S. Marines and the Stars and Stripes replaced with Catholic clergy brandishing the multi-colored gay pride flag. The UK is absent from the work -- possibly because of its on-off relationship with the rest of the continent. In a further embarrassment, the Czech government said in a statement on its presidency Web site Tuesday that the original brief was for the work to be created by 27 artists representing all EU Member States -- and that it was ""unpleasantly surprised"" to learn that this was not the case. When we received the proposal for a joint project of 27 artists, we created the conditions for its realization,"" Vondra said Thursday in quotes carried on the presidency Web site. ""The project which was then delivered by David Cerny included the names of 26 other artists, each of them being the creator of his or her own country. ""Part of the deal was that any other costs relating to production of the project would be covered by the artist himself or private funds he would find. Only after the Entropa had been installed here we learnt, much to our surprise and dismay, that the participation of 27 artists was in fact a piece of misinformation. ""It was an unpleasant shock for us although the conceptual artist DC later apologize to the government and informed us that we did not use the Czech tax payers' money appropriated for this project. ""It was an unpleasant shock for us,"" Vondra said Thursday, in speech carried.  although the conceptual artist DC later apologize to the government and informed us that we did not use the Czech tax payers' money appropriated for this project. Cerny is no stranger to controversy. In 1991 he was arrested after painting pink a Soviet tank that served as a Prague war memorial. His Web site shows other examples of his work, including previous kit-style installations entitled ""Jesus Christ"" and ""Dead Raped Woman""; and a life-size bronze fountain that depicts two men standing opposite each other, urinating. Cerny, and his main collaborators Kristof Kintera and Tomas Pospiszyl apologized to Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek and other government ministers Tuesday, according to a statement on the artist's Web site, for "" not having informed them about what is true and for having misled them."" The statement adds that Cerny and his colleagues initially wanted to use 27 European artists for ""Entropa"", but fell short due to lack of time and money. Instead, they say, they decided to create fictional artists, some of whom have even been given their own Web sites.","Czech Republic assumed six-month presidency of European Union this month .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two major civil liberties groups filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging the government's asserted authority to kill U.S. citizens living abroad who are designated as terrorists. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights announced they represent the father of influential Islamic cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, believed to be living in Yemen, who may be targeted by U.S. government drones. U.S. officials believe al-Awlaki, a Yemeni-American, influenced Maj. Nidal Hasan, the man accused of killing 13 people in the 2009 Fort Hood shootings, and played a more active role in Umar Farouk Abdul-Mutallab's attempted bombing of a U.S. airliner on Christmas Day 2009. Officials also believe al-Awlaki inspired Faisal Shahzad, who has pleaded guilty to federal terrorism charges in the attempted car bomb attack in Times Square in May, as well as several others. The ACLU and CCR announced the challenge to the government's plan to use lethal force against U.S. citizens ""located far from any battlefield without charge, trial, or judicial process of any kind,"" a statement from the groups said. ""President Obama is claiming the power to act as judge, jury, and executioner while suspending any semblance of due process,"" said Vince Warren, executive director of the CCR. The two groups and al-Awlaki's father, Nasser al-Awlaki, are particularly concerned about the use of drones to target civilian al-Qaeda supporters. Unmanned drones are frequently used in the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan, where Taliban and other insurgents are believed to be operating. The suit specifically challenges the law that prohibits attorneys from providing representation for al-Awlaki without first seeking a license from the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control. The office, which labeled al-Awlaki a ""specially designated global terrorist,"" has so far not granted the groups a license. ""The government is targeting an American citizen for death without any legal process whatsoever, while at the same time impeding lawyers from challenging that death sentence,"" said ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero. The Justice Department, which is expected to defend the administration against the lawsuit, had no immediate comment.","Two human rights groups file a lawsuit against government's targeting of American terrorists .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Hundreds of gay men have been tortured and killed in Iraq in recent months, some by the nation's security forces, Human Rights Watch said Monday. Iraqi clerics say homosexuality must be eradicated but warn against anti-gay violence. Interviews with doctors indicate hundreds of men had been killed, but the exact number was unclear because of the stigma associated with homosexuality in Iraq, the New York-based watchdog group said in its report. ""Iraq's leaders are supposed to defend all Iraqis, not abandon them to armed agents of hate,"" said Scott Long, director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights Program at Human Rights Watch. ""Turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every Iraqi."" Four victims who spoke to CNN gave accounts of the attacks, which they say have intensified in the past few months. ""In 2004, militias and unknown groups started to go after the gays ... but the peak was six months ago,"" said Qaisar, who uses a pseudonym for fear of reprisal. ""It has become wide scale war against gays in Iraq."" Iraqi officials acknowledged that the nation's culture stigmatizes homosexuality, but said the government does not condone such attacks. Authorities are unable to provide homosexuals with special protection, said government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh. According to Human Rights Watch, which is urging a government crackdown, attackers target people on the streets or storm homes, where they conduct interrogations and demand names of suspected gay men. Many end up in hospitals and morgues, the organization said, basing its conclusion on reports from doctors. Men have been threatened with ""honor killings"" by relatives worried that their ""unmanly behavior"" will ruin the family's reputation, Human Rights Watch said.  Watch Iraqi men discuss attacks » . Killings, kidnappings and torture of those suspected of homosexual conduct have intensified in areas such as the Baghdad neighborhood of Sadr City, the watchdog said. ""The Shiite people started this war and especially what happened in Sadr City,"" Qaisar said, adding that his sister-in-law had warned him against going to the area. Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army militia, which is active in Sadr City, has joined in the attacks and defends its actions as a way to stop the ""feminization"" of Iraqi men, the report said. ""We have testimony that indicates that the nation's security forces are taking part in the attacks,"" Long said. The group interviewed more than 50 people who gave accounts of abuses, beatings and stops at security checkpoints, he said. ""When the gay killings started and when they started go(ing) after them at checkpoints ... we started to change our look,"" said Basim, who also used a pseudonym. ""These killings point to the continuing and lethal failure of Iraq's post-occupation authorities to establish the rule of law and protect their citizens,"" said Rasha Moumneh, Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch. A provision from the Saddam Hussein era endorses crimes committed ""with honorable motives,"" according to the organization. The government spokesman said the provision was popular during the Saddam era, but is not used today. He added that there is a push to educate police about human rights.

A few sectors, though, have shown surprising strength and even growth amid the downturn, including British-made superyachts. The British market for superyachts grew more than 15 percent during the fiscal year ending June 1, 2009, according to a new survey. Overall revenue increased to a record $663 million (£410 million) and jobs across the industry increased five percent, according to Superyacht UK, the trade group who conducted the survey. Since last September, yacht sales tanked in many parts of the world, particularly as cash dried up among clients from Russia and the Middle East. ""It was a difficult year, many manufacturers had to cut down on production numbers and give larger discounts,"" said Georges Tchoumak, Head of Sales and Marketing for Numarine, a manufacturer of superyachts based in Turkey. In France three of the four publicly-traded yacht companies who make yachts that cost more than $40 million took advantage of the country's bankruptcy laws to stave off collapse, including Rodriguez Group, the company who built Bernard Madoff's yacht ""Bull."" Though affected by the recession, the UK industry managed to buck that trend, buoyed by a decline in the pound. ""In the last quarter of 2008 through the end of first quarter 2009 there was virtually zero activity in the large yacht sector,"" said Tim Wiltshire, Director of Burgess Yachts, a UK-based high-end boat manufacturer. Wiltshire said that at their worst, transactions were down 60 percent compared with the previous year, but that volume had recently returned, particularly in brokerage sales of used yachts. Heading into Monaco, manufacturers around the world including the UK now appear poised for a robust rebound. ""There have been a dozen significant sales in the past quarter ... enough of our customers think it's unlikely to get much worse."" But whiles sales have picked up, Wiltshire predicted it could take years for sale prices to reach the premiums of only a few years ago: ""Since early summer [business] has picked up significantly ... We are back on par with 2007, albeit at reduced values,"" he said. Manufacturers across the UK share Wiltshire's optimism, according to the survey. Ninety-five percent of UK companies questioned rated their prospects for the year ahead either ""good or excellent"" (56 percent) or ""OK"" (39 percent). At Numarine ""things are looking better for the last three months,"" Tchomak told CNN. ""We've had more sales in the past three months than in the previous 12 months,"" he wrote in an email. At Pendennis, directors have changed their business strategy to accommodate the anticipated growth. ""We've increased our investment in infrastructure for large yachts,"" said Ailes. ""Improving facilities and looking to recruit more people to work on boats up to 70 or 80 meters."" One of the reasons cited for the strength in Britain's superyacht business compared with manufacturers in other European countries has been the declining value of Sterling against the Euro. Hugo Andreae, Editor-in-Chief of Superyachtworld magazine said that the exchange rate helped, but the high quality of British boats and sustained demand among the world's wealthiest had helped hold up sales. Andreae also explained that one of the effects of the recession has been to shift demand from new builds to the used boat brokerage and chartering markets. ""There are signs that things are picking up ... Monaco is the premiere big yacht show and it's the real acid test of whether [the rebound] is the odd sale being picked up at a good price, or if the market has reignited properly,"" explained Tom Chant, International Commercial Manager for Superyacht UK. If interest in the Monaco Yacht Show is any indicator, then sales can be expected to meet bullish expectations. The annual end-of-summer yachting industry and yacht owners' conference is fully booked this week. The number of double-decker pavilions has doubled since last year, but in spite of the event's increased provision of these more expensive, higher visibility exhibition spaces supply still fell short of demand. In the United States yacht manufacturers also say they've seen a recent surge in interest in new construction of yachts over 150 feet. ""Over the last 45 days, all of a sudden, the inquires have started coming along really strong. That bodes well for the Monaco Yacht Show,"" said William Smith, V.P. of Sales and Marketing for Trinity Yachts. ""It's fair to say sales came to a shuddering halt after the Monaco show last year."" In another sign that interest in the top-end of the yacht market is back, Luxury retailer Hermes recently announced plans to team up with Wally, the Monaco superyacht company, to build a $145 million (€100 million) yacht. Sales to Russia, the Middle East and other developing countries have rebounded more quickly than sales to Europe and the U.S., according to Smith, as uncertainty about the markets has subsided and boosted consumer confidence. In the past six months, Trinity had only had one inquiry from an American, which came in the last few weeks. Trinity, the largest U.S. retailer of megayachts, has had two projects out of 17 builds stall due to the recession, both about 164 feet long. Smith said the owners can either come back and pay for them to finish the work or let Trinity sell them. Throughout the downturn Trinity was able to continue to deliver ships at a record pace, thanks to a hearty backlog of orders placed during the markets peaks.","The British market for superyachts grew more than 15 percent last year .

"(CNN) -- In decades past, your grandfather may have taken granny to the park, got down on one knee and proposed to her, with a sparkling ring in hand. Nowadays, some suitors are reaching out to their brides-to-be through their computer, pushing a button and proposing: right through the internet. As technology continues to touch on almost every aspect of social life, there is no stopping this generation's use of the internet as a tool -- even for marriage. But with these nontraditional methods of courtship, can we help but wonder: Is chivalry dead? Johannes S. Beals was surfing the net recently when he was inspired to propose marriage. The engagement ring for his long-time girlfriend had been hidden in his home for four months, and it was while chatting with other filmmakers that he figured out how he would propose to his wife. ""I saw Alyssa Milano tweet about the Old Spice Guy's personalized video responses and that's when the idea popped in my head to ask him to propose to my wife,"" said Beals, a producer and director in California. He tweeted to Isaiah Mustafa, the shirtless shower man who plays the Old Spice Guy, ""Can U Ask my girlfriend to marry me? Her name is Angela A. Hutt-Chamberlin."" Three hours later the deal was done. The Old Spice Guy, wrapped in his towel, appears in a bathroom, dims the lights, rolls in candles, holds out a ring and reads the proposal in a deep, chivalrous voice. The video proposal went viral and Beals is now on his way to becoming a married man. Beals' proposal is one example of the power the internet can have in personal lives, and raised the question about how technology impacts the tradition of the marriage proposal. Sarah Pease, owner of Brilliant Event Planning, said that as time passes, proposals are becoming more elaborate and that technology encourages more opportunities for lovers to express their creativity. However, she finds the idea of proposing online as a substitute for the traditional act of getting down on one knee a bit puzzling. ""Any proposal where the girl says yes is a great proposal,"" Pease said. ""But would I recommend proposing on Twitter or online to my clients? Never."" The current world of technology pressures people to do things bigger and better than they were done in the past, she said. Yet she believes that by using social media or the internet as a sole medium to propose devalues the wedding proposal and denies the man the true creative buzz that comes from planning a wedding proposal. ""Proposing online may work for some people, but I think there are just so many other creative ways that you can pop the question and still embrace the tradition of getting down on one knee,"" Pease said. It is men's fear of rejection that pushes them to want to go public with their proposals online, said Michael Rosenfeld, an associate professor of sociology at Stanford University. Just like proposing on a JumboTron at a baseball game, proposing in public gives men control by creating a situation that pressures women into saying yes. Watch her propose during commencement speech . ""Proposing online or in any public space has something to do with power in the relationship,"" Rosenfeld said. ""There might be fear if you ask them one-on-one because the woman might say no. Proposing in public helps to reduce that risk."" What also makes proposing online more attractive is the economic benefit and feasibility. ""The internet is a lot more accessible -- it's more difficult to get a billboard at a baseball game or to hire a jumbo jet,"" said Christina Warren, whose fiancé proposed to her on Twitter in January 2009. ""Grand gestures can be made online at little to no cost, and depending on the people that are involved, the proposal becomes more meaningful,"" Warren said. The reporter for Mashable.com and her computer programmer fiancé are self-proclaimed computer nerds whose obsessions with all things tech made their online proposal feel appropriate. Yet it is this dramatic sense of efficiency, Rosenfeld said, that supports technology's ""obsessive and overtrumping culture."" The meaning behind the tradition of the wedding proposal and the chivalrous man coming to court his lady's hand gets lost in a whirlwind of information that appears to be attempts at just being noticed. ""With the internet, people tend to be less concerned with privacy,"" Rosenfeld said. ""They want to be obsessively public about something that people may think of as a private matter."" ""Fame and notoriety is something that people always have sought. In the internet age, the border to fame and notoriety is much lower, and because we live in an age of very gratifying self promotion, online proposals can sometimes devalue tradition."" Watch man propose on live TV . But for those who fame has hit for venturing online with a wedding proposal -- such as Stephanie Sullivan Rewis and Greg Rewis, who became the first couple to propose on Twitter -- chivalry is still alive. ""I didn't feel any different than women whose boyfriend proposes on the JumboTron or billboard in Times Square feel,"" said Stephanie Rewis. ""Is it the method that matters or the thought and outcome?"" Rosenfeld said he agrees with the latter. ""I think that people can still have a very old fashioned view of relationships and the pursuit of marriage. The way people meet and are doing things are rapidly changing, and the internet is increasingly becoming the intermediary for all that. ""So chivalry isn't dead. I think it is every bit of alive as it has ever been.""","Some couples use sites such as Twitter or YouTube to propose .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerian gunmen on Sunday released 12 sailors who ship was attacked two days earlier off the country's coast, a spokesman for the Nigerian military said. Pirates had boarded a German-flagged ship off the coast of Nigeria on Friday night and took the foreigners hostage, the country's military said. The attack took place about four nautical miles off Bonny Island, said Lt. Col. Timothy Antigha of the military Joint Task Force (JTF) in the Niger Delta. He didn't release any details on the pirates, only saying they are ""criminals."" One sailor was wounded in the attack and left on the boat, he said. The kidnappers later abandoned the ship and it was retrieved by the Nigerian navy. The freed sailors were on their way to Bonny Island, where their ship is currently anchored off the coast of the southern Nigerian state of Rivers. Earlier, Antigha had said he did not know the nationalities of the abducted sailors or whether the pirates had demanded a ransom.","NEW: Gunmen release their 12 hostages .

"(CNN) -- The rebellion by paramilitary Bangladesh Rifles troops apparently ended Thursday after they handed over their weapons inside their headquarters in the capital city's Pilkhana district, the national press agency quoted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as saying in a nationwide televised address. However, the fate of top military officers who were taken hostage Wednesday was unclear, according to the news agency, Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha, or BSS, on its Web site. Home Minister Sahara Khatun ""oversaw a rescue campaign along with a government delegation in search of bodies of officers, BDR soldiers, their family members and relatives,"" the agency said. The Bangladesh Rifles is also known as the BDR. Bangladeshi soldiers take position armed with automatic weapons in Dhaka on Wednesday. Earlier Thursday, the country's home minister, Sahara Khatun, said mutinous paramilitary troops were close to laying down their arms and many had returned to their barracks. ""They have raised white flags and the situation is in its last stages,"" added a government official who did not want to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. ""The army presence is a means to secure the area and there is nothing to be worried about."" Still, for a jittery city, the heavy military presence near the gates of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) headquarters in the Pilkhana area raised fears of a potentially deadly confrontation. ""This cannot be good,"" said Palash Chowdhury, who was watching the drama unfold from his uncle's house a few blocks away. ""This cannot be good."" Meanwhile, police in about six other towns reported shooting incidents involving Rifles troops, another government official confirmed to CNN. The incidents do not appear to have resulted in casualties, but had raised fears that the mutiny would spread outside the capital. Bangladesh Police spokesman Kamrul Ahsan disputed the reports to CNN. But concerned residents were not so readily appeased. ""Yesterday, people thought this was an internal BDR grievance and it would be worked out,"" said Rashid Zaman, a Dhaka resident. ""Now, we see the scope is much broader, that it's getting serious. There's an uncertainty. No one knows which way things will turn.""  Watch a witness describe seeing and hearing the gunbattle » . Shops and offices in the capital sent workers home. Adding to the city's paranoia: Dhaka residents suddenly found themselves unable to make or receive calls from elsewhere in the country. ""Many people are finding this troubling,"" said Zahid Hussain, a former journalist who is now part of a U.S.-funded effort to create an investigative journalism center in the country. ""Whenever the army has gone into action in the past, they cut off the mobile connection so nobody can pass information."" The standoff at the Bangladesh Rifles headquarters began Wednesday morning after a gun battle. At least 50 officers and civilians were feared dead in the gunfire, the country's law minister said.  Watch how paramilitary revolt has spread » . As dawn broke Thursday, the rebelling troops with the Bangladesh Rifles allowed government officials entry into the headquarters. They went door-to-door at officers' quarters to assure frightened women and children it was safe to come out. CNN was not immediately able to confirm the exact casualty count, with medical officials saying a final number would come after they had a chance to comb through the premises looking for bodies. At least six bodies were recovered from rivers and drainage ditches Thursday, bringing the total to eight. Many of them had on military uniforms, government officials said. Authorities say the men had been killed and their bodies dumped in sewers. They were recovered after they floated for miles down rivers. The Bangladesh Rifles is responsible primarily for guarding the country's borders. The force, numbering more than 65,000, also takes part in operations such as monitoring polls. The troops staged their rebellion on the second day of BDR Week, when officers and troop members from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations. At least 5,000 BDR personnel were inside the compound when the mutiny occurred about 7:45 a.m. local time Wednesday, said Mohammed Sajjad Haider, spokesman for the information ministry. The rebelling troops were low-ranking members of the BDR, akin to infantrymen, who were angry at the way they were treated by their superiors, Haider said. ""They have several demands,"" Haider said. ""They want pay parity with the army, they want job security, they want better food rations."" The mutiny is the most serious crisis for Bangladesh's newly elected government, which came into power in December after two years of army-backed rule.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is calling for the immediate release of three American hikers seized by Iranian forces along the Iraqi border who will have been in custody for exactly a year on Saturday. ""Their unjust detention has nothing to do with the issues that continue to divide the United States and the international community from the Iranian government,"" Obama said in a statement Friday. ""This is a humanitarian imperative, as these three young people are innocent of any crime."" The three Americans -- Sarah Shourd, Shane Bauer, and Josh Fattal -- were detained after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border while hiking in Iraq's Kurdistan region. The Nation magazine reported last month that two witnesses have said they saw members of Iran's national police force cross into Iraq to apprehend the three. Tehran has claimed the three hikers are spies. Iran's intelligence minister has hinted the country may consider releasing them in exchange for the release of Iranian prisoners, according to state media. ""I want to be perfectly clear: Sarah, Shane and Josh have never worked for the United States government,"" Obama said. ""They are simply open-minded and adventurous young people who represent the best of America, and of the human spirit. They are teachers, artists, and advocates for social and environmental justice. They have never had any quarrel with the government of Iran, and have great respect for the Iranian people."" The president said he spoke with the hikers' mothers this week and noted that the Iranian government allowed the women to visit their children earlier this year. But ""I cannot imagine how painful it was for these three courageous women to return home without their children. I told these three mothers that Sarah, Shane and Josh are in my thoughts and prayers, and that the U.S. government would continue to do all that it could to secure their release."" Meanwhile, the mothers continue to grow increasingly angry and exasperated as they press the Iranian government to free their children. ""This is unbelievable to us at this point,"" Nora Shourd told CNN's American Morning earlier Friday. ""I mean, it is outrageous that they are still there."" Shourd, the mother of hiker Sarah Shourd, said at first they thought the ordeal would be ""over fairly quickly."" She said it has gone on ""long enough."" Obama also recently spoke with the wife of Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who went missing in Iran over three years ago. ""We continue to have no information about his welfare, and reiterate our call for the government of Iran to provide any information that it has about his whereabouts,"" the president said. ""It is time to facilitate Robert Levinson's return to the family and friends who have suffered so greatly in his absence.""","Three American hikers have been in Iranian custody for a year on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- As temperatures climbed toward the 90s across the Washington metro region Monday, hundreds of thousands of people were left to cope with the blistering heat as utility crews worked to restore power after a violent thunderstorm that killed two people. A 6-year-old boy was fatally injured while walking with his family Sunday afternoon in Sterling, Virginia, when heavy wind caused a large section of a tree to fall, according to Kraig Troxell, a spokesman for the Loudoun County sheriff. The boy, whose name was not released, died at a Virginia hospital, Troxell said. A second person was killed and another was injured in Beltsville, Maryland, on Sunday when a tree fell on the car in which they were riding, according to Cpl. Clinton Copeland, a spokesman for the Prince George's County Police Department. Meanwhile, utility crews restored power to a Washington-area nursing home that has been forced to brave the elements since Sunday afternoon. Cooling buses and emergency crews worked with building nurses and officials until power was restored about 1 p.m Monday, according to Pete Piringer, a spokesman for the District of Columbia Fire and EMS. As a precautionary measure, five people were transported to area hospitals with heat-related illness. Their conditions were not severe, Piringer added. Electricity provider Pepco said Monday that about 220,000 residences across the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia were still in the dark -- and without air-conditioning -- following one of the hottest days of the year. July's brutal onslaught of record heat continued in the eastern United States, with temperature records set Sunday in Baltimore, Maryland, where it hit 100 degrees, and Washington, where it was 98. By Monday afternoon, damage had been reported across the region from 270 downed trees or very large limbs, including approximately 20 full large trees, according to the District Department of Transportation. More than 20 traffic signals remained out because of power problems, the department added. The storm was part of a slow-moving front that struck parts of the Northeast before moving south. Heat advisories and warnings continue for the Deep South in parts of Georgia and South Carolina through Monday; the heat index is expected to exceed 105 degrees. CNN's Angela Fritz, Jonathan Helman and Devon Sayers contributed to this report.","NEW: Power restored at Washington-area nursing home .

"Editor's note: Annette Gordon-Reed won the 2008 National Book Award for ""The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family,"" a book the award judges said, ""is more than the story of Thomas Jefferson and his house slave Sally Hemings; it is a deeply moral and keenly intelligent probe of the harsh yet all-too-human world they inhabited and the bloodline they share."" She is a law professor at New York Law School and a history professor at Rutgers University, and editor of ""Race on Trial: Law and Justice in American History."" Annette Gordon-Reed says Barack Obama's election reshapes perceptions about race in America. (CNN) -- By now, it has become almost a cliché: ""I never thought I'd live to see it happen."" That common reaction to the election of Barack Obama, an African-American, to the presidency of the United States captures much about the country's troubled racial history. Black people have been a presence on the North American continent from the early 1600s, and the 1500s if you count the Spanish settlement at St. Augustine, Florida. Yet, the fact that we were brought to America as slaves and had to wage a centuries-long battle for freedom -- and then for civic and civil rights -- has often shaped perceptions about what is and is not possible for blacks to achieve. It has also shaped views about what whites as a group will and will not tolerate when it comes to black advancement, as if the races were in a zero-sum competition; any black ""gain"" seems to be viewed automatically as a ""loss"" to whites. True, the president-elect did not get a majority of white votes, and much opposition to him was clearly based upon his race -- sometimes shockingly so. One of my most poignant memories of the campaign will always be an exchange I had with a friend who had gone to Pennsylvania to canvass for Obama. The experience was at once exhilarating and disheartening to him. An idealistic young white man who had grown up in a progressive community, he was happy to have a candidate he could support enthusiastically, yet he found himself crestfallen when would-be voters told him flatly that they would never vote for a black man for president. Not that Obama's political views were anathema to them, or that he did not have enough experience: his race alone was a deal breaker. The question, from the moment it was clear that Obama was a serious contender, was just how many Americans were like the people my young friend encountered. All over the world, those who figured such people represented the majority of white Americans, asked, ""Will they (meaning whites, obviously) let him win?"" Singer Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders reportedly answered that question, saying in Blender magazine that while she really liked Obama, she knew her ""people"" (again, meaning, whites) and they would not allow him to win. In the end, no critical mass of eligible white voters came out to defend the White House as ""whites-only"" territory. The possible legions fulfilling the expectation of the ""Bradley Effect"" -- when prospective voters tell pollsters they might vote for a black candidate, intending all the while to vote for the white candidate -- never materialized. Or, if they did, their votes were not enough to change the outcome. The Obama candidacy was essentially a bet that the conventional wisdom about what we ""knew"" of white Americans was faulty. ""Yes We Can"" could mean many things, but it was certainly an ingenious way to address the racial question. It called on black and white alike to ignore edicts imposed from the outside about what they were ""supposed"" to do, think and feel. This was a bigger hurdle for whites. Blacks have been voting for whites for as long as we have been allowed to vote. While race could remain a factor for whites, in today's world, it might not trump everything. Concerns about an unpopular war, fatigue with the party in power, the lack of enthusiasm for the  candidates on the opposing ticket and sheer terror as the economy slid into the abyss might loom as more important than a candidate's color, if one had the right candidate. Make no mistake: the times we live in fostered Obama's triumph. The country has had unpopular wars, bad candidates and shaky economic times before, and it is safe to say that no black candidate, no matter how talented, could have been elected president during those earlier times. Obama's success is evidence that the United States has changed in important ways. It does not, however, signal the death of racism in the country, anymore than the passages of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, the decision in Brown v. Board of Education, or the enactment of the civil rights provisions of the 1960s ended the struggle against racial prejudice. Each of those momentous events, considered almost miraculous in their time, brought vibrant hopes that were far too often dashed. They were just beginnings, means to an end that was yet to come. Racism is no easy foe. The election of one man will not, by itself, be enough to overcome the history that has given race its meaning in the United States. It is clear, however, that we must edit our narrative about race. We, all of us, must reconsider the things we say people can do and cannot do today, because of the truths we know about our past. The election of 2008 is evidence that many Americans may be willing to do that; to chart a new course on the question of race. I am not totally surprised. Back in 1997, when I started traveling the country speaking about my first book, ""Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy,"" I braced myself for the hostility I anticipated from whites who might not be able to accept that our third president had children with an enslaved African-American woman. Instead, many people -- most typically Southern whites -- came out to tell me about their ""Hemings-Jefferson"" type family histories, eager to contribute to a more truthful account of what has happened between the races from this country's beginnings. Impulses to truth and reconciliation, wherever found and however expressed, should be nurtured. A better future depends upon it. Yes we can. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Annette Gordon-Reed.","Annette Gordon-Reed: Obama bet perception of racial barriers was faulty .

"LONDON, England -- A severe rabies epidemic has claimed the lives of at least 83 children within three months in Angola's capital, Luanda, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. Luanda, which has a large population of stray dogs, also has some of the world's worst slums. Describing the situation as ""very worrying,""  WHO rabies expert Francois Meslin told CNN: ""This is a huge number and could be the tip of the iceberg."" A doctor working at the country's biggest referral hospital Hospital Pediatrico David Bernardino said staff were unable to save any of the children as rabies vaccines had run out. Some of the children were also brought into the hospital too late to be saved, Luis Bernardino, head of the hospital told UN humanitarian organization IRIN. He warned that the number of deaths could be much higher. ""The children were brought to our hospital and are the only ones we know of, so the number could be higher,"" Bernardino told IRIN. ""It is a sad moment for us,"" he added. ""I think it was probably that no one was prepared for such a high case load."" The number of cases has now started declining, however, said Bernardino. According to Meslin, this could be because the current infected pack of dogs has died. Meslin told CNN that the Angolan government needed to embark on a dog rabies control program urgently to prevent further outbreaks. Angola's capital, where most of the population live in slums, has a large number of stray dogs who are said to have caused the epidemic. ""We have had some sporadic cases in other provincial capitals in the country; we think the virus was brought into Luanda and then spread through the dogs -- Angolans love dogs,"" Bernardino said. ""When the first 10 deaths were reported in December 2008 we alerted the authorities, but we do not have veterinary services in the city, no kennels [to keep and observe the animals] and vaccinate them,"" he added. Another problem contributing to the crisis is that vaccines are too expensive for the average family. ""One dose of vaccine costs about $10 and five of those have to be administered, which makes the total cost of treatment $50 which is more than a month's salary for families in most developing countries,"" Meslin added. In 2008 the WHO wrote that rabies, a disease transmitted from animals with infected saliva to humans, is present on nearly every continent of the world but more that 95 per cent of human deaths occur in Asia and Africa. It can be prevented by vaccination, either prior to exposure or as part of post-exposure treatment. But once symptoms of the disease develop, rabies is fatal. According to the WHO, rabies can affect the lungs, stomach and central nervous systems. In the critical stage, a victim slips into a coma and death, usually due to breathing failure. More than 55,000 people die of rabies each year, the WHO wrote, with 30 to 60 per cent of the victims of dog bites being children under the age of 15.","A severe rabies epidemic has killed at least 83 children in 3 months in Angola .

"ANTIOCH, California (CNN) -- A bone fragment found near the northern California home of kidnapping and rape suspect Phillip Garrido could add another chapter to the twisted tale. Cases of missing girls Ilene Misheloff, left, and Michaela Garecht now linked to Garrido investigation. On Tuesday, authorities will try to determine whether the bone is human and whether it connects Garrido, 58, to any crimes beyond the alleged kidnapping and imprisonment of Jaycee Lee Dugard, who went missing in 1991 at age 11. Investigators said they found the bone on a neighbor's property in an area to which Garrido had access. Crews were using cadaver dogs to search the property, said Jimmy Lee, a spokesman for the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department. Investigators are looking into other cases that may involve Garrido, giving hope to parents including Sharon Murch, whose daughter, Michaela Garecht, was abducted at age 9 in 1988. ""I leaped up yelling, 'Oh, my God.' I was, of course, joyful for Jaycee herself, but my first thought was 'please, God, let Michaela be with her,'"" she said. ""I was very high for a while. I was very low for a while.""  Watch Murch describe the cases' similarities » .

Dugard is with her mother at an undisclosed location along with a team of psychologists and law enforcement officers, he said. He has not seen or spoken to his stepdaughter. The last time he saw her was 18 years ago, when he watched helplessly as she was kidnapped at a bus stop near the family's home.  See photos of Dugard's living conditions » . FBI special agent Chris Campion, lead federal investigator in the case, said Dugard's mother, Terry Probyn, was ""ecstatic"" her daughter was found. ""When I called her she was beside herself with joy, and I was present when she was reunited with Jaycee,"" he said. ""It was a very emotional scene. Both of them were just overjoyed to be with each other again. There's going to be a period of adjustment, no doubt, but they're doing very well at this point. And the two daughters are probably as happy as Jaycee is to be part of this family, as well."" Police in Hayward, California, are trying to determine whether Garrido is linked to the 1988 kidnapping of Michaela Garecht, said Hayward police Lt. Chris Orrey. Garecht and Dugard were of similar age and appearance, both were abducted in daylight, and a sketch of a suspect resembled Garrido, Orrey said. There are differences, as well, but she declined to elaborate. The similarities in the cases, the fact that Dugard was found close to home and comments from neighbors make Murch think her daughter could have been on Garrido's compound. ""I understand that a few years ago, one of the neighbors called in and said that there were girls being kept in the backyard. ... She said that there were a number of girls that came and went, but that there was a core group of five,"" Murch said. She hopes her daughter was among them. In Dublin, California, police were looking into whether Garrido was connected to the 1989 disappearance of Ilene Misheloff who was 13 when she was abducted, investigators said. Garrido was convicted of kidnapping and raping Katie Callaway Hall in 1976. He was released after serving 10 years of a 50-year sentence. He was labeled a sex offender and put on lifetime parole. Garrido abducted Hall after she agreed to give him a ride to a supermarket. He took her to a mini-warehouse in Reno, Nevada, where he raped her. She managed to escape soon afterward. ""I can't imagine what Jaycee is going through. He had me for eight hours. He had her for 18 years,"" Hall said. During those years, according to Garrido's own writings, he began to feel remorse for things he had done. The revelations came in documents obtained by CNN that Garrido delivered to an FBI office in San Francisco, California, just days before he was arrested in the Dugard case. The writings were a two-part manifesto in which he discussed the ""Origin of schizophrenia revealed."" In the second part of the documents Garrido detailed his struggle with sexual urges in ""Stepping into the light."" He confessed his past aggressive sexual impulses, but said he is no longer that man.  Watch interview with Garrido » . Garrido also wrote that he could control minds with sound and could help others before they committed violence. Dugard apparently led an outwardly unremarkable life. Customers of Garrido's printing company, Printing for Less, knew her as ""Allissa."" ""She was always having a very pretty smile on the face,"" said Deepal Karunaratne, who had real estate brochures printed. ""She comes and talks to me and was always smiling. She was a very pretty girl, a very pretty young lady."" Garrido even used a picture of Dugard to promote his printing company, customer Cheyvonne Molino said. ""About 10 years ago, when he started printing our cards, he was looking for business,"" said Molino, who runs an auto wrecking yard with her husband. ""He would leave your cards with his cards and her picture -- blonde hair, blue eyes, beautiful young lady. She was on everyone's card."" Dugard's two daughters -- 11-year-old ""Angel"" and 15-year-old ""Starlet"" -- attended birthday parties and loved the TV show ""Hannah Montana."" The media ""made it seem like these little girls were living like wolves or jungle kids in the backyard dungeon. Perhaps that's it, but they didn't give that visual to me,"" Molino said. Two weeks ago, the girls attended a birthday party for Molino's daughter. ""They were polite,"" Molino said. ""They were well-mannered.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Denzel Washington's new movie, ""The Taking of Pelham 123,"" is not a remake, even though Walter Matthau starred in a film by the same name in 1974, the actor told CNN. Denzel Washington plays a transit official, once demoted, in ""The Taking of Pelham 123."" Moreover, Washington's character is not like the hostage negotiator he played three years ago in ""Inside Man,"" although the movie is about his negotiation with a deranged ex-con hostage-holder, played by John Travolta, Washington said. And he's right. The updated ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" is a riveting movie about a subway dispatcher confronted by a former Wall Street trader seeking revenge -- not just a ransom, as in the 1974 film -- from the city of New York for sending him to prison. The movie opens nationwide Friday. It's essentially a two-character play, with much of the dialogue delivered over a two-way radio between Washington, in the train control center, and Travolta, on a hijacked train, director Tony Scott said. The drama is paced and punctuated by a dramatic above-ground sequence, including plenty of crashes, as police rush to deliver a $10 million cash ransom before a deadline. Travolta's character is ""a contradiction of what you normally expect in a bad guy,"" Scott said. ""He's funny, he's smart, and he's got a big heart."" While Travolta, who is mourning the loss of his teenage son earlier this year, did not participate in interviews, he issued a written statement that called his character ""the ultimate evil mastermind."" ""This role as an actor gave me the chance to dispense with all moral and ethical limitations, and explore just how bad this character could really be,"" Travolta said. Washington said his character, a transit official demoted to dispatcher because he was suspected of taking a bribe, is a new twist on the familiar hostage negotiator role. ""I was concerned a little bit about 'Inside Man' where I was a cop and a hostage negotiator,"" he said. ""I just liked the idea when they hand him a gun that he'd never held one before, that he was an ordinary guy in an extraordinary situation and with this cloud over his head. He didn't come to work knowing he was going to get an opportunity to redeem himself."" Washington, who looks younger and more fit than his character, said to prepare for the role he ""ate a lot and kept getting smaller and smaller sweaters to wear."" James Gandolfini's role as New York's mayor is a combination of current and former mayors -- Michael Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani. While he has Bloomberg's Wall Street savvy, he carries himself like Guiliani on September 11, 2001. New York City is also a major character, Scott said. Many scenes were shot below ground in subway tunnels and a closed down transit station in lower Manhattan, mostly at night, Scott said. It took four weeks of tedious shooting, he said. ""It's just a whole other world down there,"" said Washington. An old train car was rebuilt to accommodate cameras and placed on a sound stage in Queens for scenes that couldn't be shot underground, Scott said. The same person who designed the Metropolitan Transit Authority's (MTA) high-tech control center was hired to build a replica on a sound stage in Queens, he said. Brian Helgeland, who wrote the screenplay, revealed the secret about why he would use an older movie title for a film they do not want seen as a remake. Since Sony Pictures already owned the rights to ""The Taking of Pelham 123,"" it made it an easier sell to the studio, he said. The original film, whose title had the number spelled out -- ""One Two Three"" -- was based on a best-selling 1973 novel by John Godey, and starred Robert Shaw as the villain opposite Matthau. ""The start was using that as a title, something the studio would feel comfortable making rather than just a nameless, orphan idea that you might have on your own, to try to put that together and use 'Pelham' as a springboard to make your own crime movie,"" Helgeland said. iReport.com: Share your review of ""Pelham"" He tried to stay away from the original ""Pelham"" particulars ""but we had the same situation as the core, which was a hostage situation with one guy in the train with the hostages and another guy outside dealing with him over the radio."" Putting the movie together, he said, was ""a little bit like trying to pull off a heist, putting the pieces together, with a getaway car driver and a safecracker and all that stuff.""","""The Taking of Pelham 123"" is re-imagining of 1974 film .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India accorded a red-carpet welcome Tuesday to the top leader of Myanmar's military junta, who is on a five-day visit aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties between the neighboring countries. Gen. Than Shwe received a ceremonial reception in the sandstone presidential palace in New Delhi before he drove down to the shrine to India's independence leader, Mahatma Gandhi, to pay homage. Indian President Pratibha Devisingh Patil, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, members of his cabinet and several top bureaucrats greeted the junta leader as a state guest. The military ruler's trip underscored the close relationship between the two nations -- one seen as one of the world's most vibrant democracies, and another despised by the West as a repressive regime. In 1951, the two countries signed what they called a ""treaty of friendship,"" and over the past few years, bilateral trade has soared to almost $1 billion, according to Indian officials. Several Indian companies have invested in Myanmar's energy sector. And India's main space agency has helped set up a data-processing center in Yangon for remote-sensing applications, authorities in New Delhi say. Than Shwe's visit began on Sunday with a tour of sacred Buddhist sites in eastern India. It came days after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged India and other countries in the region to push Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, to comply with U.N. human rights resolutions and nuclear nonproliferation agreements. ""It is critical that Burma hear from you, its neighbors,"" she said in a speech at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting.

"(CNN)  -- As world leaders meet in Toronto for the G-20 summit, disagreements are brewing over how the global economy's fragile recovery should best be steered. The United States has been urging other countries not to pull back on stimulus plans too quickly. Britain, in contrast, has recently joined other European countries in announcing drastic budget cuts as fears grow about mounting public debt. The last G-20 summit was September in Pittsburgh. Since then sovereign debt issues have clouded the global economic recovery. Dubai's debt worries in November foreshadowed the Greek debt crisis, which spiraled to other southern European nations. Public debt woes saw the value of the euro dip from $1.50 in December to below $1.20 earlier this month, sparking fears the 17-nation bloc united under the currency may collapse. Armed man arrested near G-20 site . U.S. President Barack Obama fears a roll-back too soon from government stimulus packages would send the world back into recession. The European Union has sent a letter to all G-20 leaders asking for substantial budget cuts to come no later than 2011. ""The Germans are worried about the knock-on effects of southern Europe financing. And the Americans, not having experienced that problem, don't recognize it and they don't understand why countries should be cutting back when in fact the recovery is at such a nascent stage,"" said Simon Evenett of the Center for Economic Policy Research. Also high on the agenda will be reforms to global banking regulations. Although all G-20 nations pledged banking reforms, the reforms being mooted in Europe and North America are diverging. Britain, France and Germany are calling on taxes on banks to pay down deficits and cushion future financial shocks. The U.S. wants to discourage additional taxes, which officials fear will stunt consumer demand. ""Behind the calls for us to pursue a more expansionary fiscal course lie two different approaches to economic policymaking on each side of the Atlantic,"" German Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schäuble wrote in a Wednesday op-ed piece in the Financial Times. ""While U.S. policymakers like to focus on short-term corrective measures, we take the longer view and are, therefore, more preoccupied with the implications of excessive deficits and the dangers of high inflation."" UK Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said: ""We will have to see what comes out of the G-20. I'm not going to give any forecast on that. I think it is important that we have acted because we recognize the risks the banking system poses to the U.S. economy. Certainly, France and Germany recognize those risks, also."" The sessions will offer a first appearance on the world stage for British Prime Minister David Cameron and Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan. Both leaders arrived in Toronto on Thursday.

"New York (CNN) -- A vintage street sign that once stood at the foot of the New York Stock Exchange in the late 19th and early 20th centuries -- a period known as Wall Street's Gilded Age -- was auctioned off Monday for a price befitting the neighborhood: $116,500. The enamel-engraved, cast iron-bracketed sign was mounted at the corner of Wall and Broad streets in front of the J.P. Morgan and Co. bank building, also known as the ""House of Morgan."" The bank, owned by the influential industrialist J.P. Morgan, was the site of the notorious Wall Street Bombing of 1920, in which a horse-drawn wagon packed with 100 pounds of dynamite detonated in the crowded financial district. Shrapnel scars from the blast are still visible on the sign. The attack, which occurred shortly after noon on September 16, 1920, left 38 people dead and hundreds wounded. At the time, it had been the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil to date. The perpetrators were never caught, but historians suspect radical anarchists were to blame. The bombing helped ignite the Red Scare that came to define the following decades. The intersection of Wall Street and Broad Street was again the scene of chaos in the wake of the Stock Market Crash of 1929, when crowds assembled outside the New York Stock Exchange in shock. Sung-Hee Park, a spokeswoman for Chrisite's Auction House, said the sale surpassed pre-auction expectations of $60,000 to $80,000. She said the buyer was a collector in Asia, and the bid was placed by telephone.","Sign marked intersection of Wall and Broad streets more than a century ago .

"New York (CNN) -- Some chose coffee, others started the day with a Irish stout, but all were in full cheer Wednesday morning as fans watched the United States team score a last-minutes goal to defeat Algeria 1-0 in World Cup competition. ""They had so many chances. I'm just glad they finally pulled it out,"" one relieved fan said when the game ended. ""I was so hyperventilating,"" a woman who identified herself only as Sheryl said, wearing a U.S.A. outfit. Her husband, John, had given up. ""I thought it was going to wind up a tie. And from the 90th minute on I was, like, it's gonna be over, it's gonna be over. And somebody scored, I almost died. Unbelievable. The place went nuts,"" John said.

But in the 91st minute, Landon Donovan knocked in a deflected ball. In open-early-morning bars, cheering evolved into pandemonium, and chants of ""Landon Donovan"" filled the room. Earlier near-misses were immediately forgotten. As patrons filed out of one bar, the crowd took a more musical tone as they broke into a rendition of ""America the Beautiful."" One enterprising man sold USA jerseys out of a suitcase in front of that bar. As soon as as Donovan scored, he hiked his prices from $5 to $15. ""Bring on the Germans,"" one fan said.

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal's first-ever President Ram Baran Yadav took the oath of office Wednesday, two days after his election. Yadav, a physician in his 60s, was elected president on Monday by Nepal's constituent assembly, almost two months after the country was declared a republic, putting an end to the 239-year-old monarchy. People lined the streets, which were emptied of vehicles, as the presidential motorcade drove about five miles (8 km) from Yadav's home to the presidential offices. He was driven in the bulletproof vehicle previously used by Nepal's kings. Yadav was administered the oath of office by Chief Justice Kedar Prasad Giri. ""I represent all Nepali people in this august office and in all my efforts and endeavors I will be committed to the benefit of the Nepali people,"" Yadav said after the swearing-in. Yadav then administered the oath of office to the newly elected vice president Parmananda Jha. The post of the president is largely ceremonial. He will swear in the country's new prime minister, who has the executive powers. The president can also deploy the armed forces, but only at the recommendation of the prime minister. Nepal's Maoists, which won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority in April's general elections, said Tuesday they may not form a government after their candidate for president was defeated. ""The defeat of our candidate has put us in the opposition from the moral viewpoint,"" said Maoist leader Prachanda, also known as Pushpa Kamal Dahal. However, he did not rule out the possibility of leading the government if a new coalition were formed. On Monday, lawmakers picked Yadav over the Maoists' choice for president -- Ram Raja Prasad Singh -- by 308 votes to 282. The Maoists are the largest party in the constituent assembly, but Yadav was able to win with backing from a coalition of the Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and Madhesi Janadhikar (People's Rights) Forum. Prachanda -- who is the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) -- called the alliance between the three parties ""unnatural"" and ""apolitical."" The Maoists have 229 seats in the 601-member constituent assembly. April's elections, the declaration of a republic and the drafting of a new constitution -- the main task of the constituent assembly -- are parts of a peace process following 10 years of fighting between the Maoists and the state. The violence claimed 13,000 lives. A peace accord in November 2006 ended the fighting .

The win also marked a fifth individual NBA title for L.A playmaker Kobe Bryant, equaling a record set by retired Lakers player Magic Johnson who ran on to the court to congratulate the guard at the end of the game . ""This was the hardest one by far."" Bryant, who finished with 23 points but only 6 out of 24 on shooting, told the official Lakers website. ""I wanted it so bad and sometimes when you want it so bad, it slips away from you. My guys picked me up."" The Lakers had to come behind from to take game seven, after the Celtics built up an early 13 point lead. However, the West Coast side edged ahead in the final quarter, thanks to two free throws from Sasha Vujacic which were enough to seal a win and for the side to take the series 4-3. But it was veteran player Ron Artest who added 20 points to the Lakers overall score and Spanish forward Pau Gasol, with 19 points and 17 rebounds, who were the key to the Californian victory. ""I can't say enough about 'Spain'. That guy's unbelievable, a hell of a player - we wouldn't have won it without him,"" Bryant said. And Lakers coach Phil Jackson who now has 11 titles to his name, was full of praise for 30-year-old Artest. ""He was the most valuable player tonight. He brought life to our team, he brought life to the crowd,"" Jackson told his team's official website.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Ariel Sigler is the latest of 21 Cuban political prisoners to fly into exile after being freed from jail in Cuba. Gaunt, and confined to a wheelchair, the former boxer received a hero's welcome in Miami. Later at a hospital, he talked about his release. ""The first dish that I was able to taste with great delight was the dish of freedom, the dish of democracy, the dish of my second country that has received me as if I was another one of its children,"" Sigler said. Cuba has agreed to release a total of 52 political prisoners by-mid November as part of a deal with the Catholic Church and Spain. International pressure to free them grew when one prisoner died earlier this year after an 84-day hunger strike. But the Cuban government has also ratcheted up its own campaign. It is denouncing the imprisonment of five Cuban agents held in the United States since 1998. They're convicted of spying in the United States. In Cuba, they're considered heroes, fighting to protect the homeland from extremists in Miami. Over the weekend, Cuba's National Assembly accused the U.S. of putting one of the agents, Gerardo Hernandez, in what assembly members called an ""isolation hole"" even though he was ill. The National Assembly signed a petition calling the conditions of Hernandez's current confinement ""so harsh that his health and physical integrity are being seriously affected."" U.S. officials could not be reached immediately for comment. Hernandez's wife recalled Cuban President Raul Castro's offer of a gesture for a gesture. ""Our president was very clear,"" she said. ""We were waiting for the U.S. to free the five and we would hand over the prisoners we have in Cuba, even with their relatives. Cuba has complied with its gesture.""

Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . Oil has affected sections of Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key beaches, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Photos from the area showed patches of dark, syruplike oil on the white sand, but local officials said the situation is getting better. ""Our beaches continue to improve hourly as the crews clean up,"" said Ed Schroeder, director of Visit Pensacola, in a statement on the bureau's website. On Thursday, yellow tape blocked about a quarter mile of the beach to public access, CNN affiliate WPMI-TV reported. Local officials said the temporary closure was put in place to speed up the cleanup process. Pensacola Beach is open, but the waters from the Park West recreation area to the area just west of Portofino are closed to all swimming and wading until further notice because of large quantities of emulsified oil in shore waters and along the shoreline, the visitors bureau said.

"(Parenting.com) -- Like many toddlers, little Kate Davis attends a mommy-and-me story time and playgroup in her hometown of Elgin, Illinois. Although it sounds lovely, it's a source of anguish (some call it working-mommy guilt) for her mother, because Kate attends with her nanny, Sarah, and not with her mother. ""I'm happy Kate gets to go, but I feel guilty that I'm not the one taking her,"" says Jenny Davis, who hired Sarah a year ago to take care of Kate while both she and her husband work. Parenting.com: Moms' dirty little secrets . ""I feel jealous that they do fun things together while I'm the one who forces Kate to eat the vegetables she hates. I make dinner, give her a bath, brush her teeth, and then she's off to bed. There's no time to goof off."" While this isn't uncommon, there are easy solutions, says parenting expert Michelle LaRowe, author of ""Nanny to The Rescue!"" and ""A Mom's Ultimate Book of Lists."" For example, there's no reason why mom shouldn't get in on the fun. ""When parents come home, I recommend they change into play clothes, put down their phones and transition into family time. As soon as they walk in the door, they should get down on child's level to help her warm up to you,"" says LaRowe. Parenting.com: How to handle annoying advice . What happens if you feel like the nanny may even be a better mom than you are? ""Kate has tantrums if you give her water instead of orange juice,"" Davis says. ""But Sarah will just ask her to get her cup and drink the water, and she'll accept it."" The nanny also seems better able to control stressful situations, like when Kate throws food from her high chair to alert everyone she's done. ""Maybe it's because Sarah is right on top of her, and I'm trying to load the dishwasher and get household chores done at the same time,"" Davis says. Parenting.com: 20 of the greatest mom tips, ever . LaRowe says nannies may actually have an easier time disciplining because they're not the mom. ""While nannies genuinely love the children in their care, they aren't ruled by emotions when setting boundaries. It may be more convenient to give in, but due to experience, they're aware of the consequences,"" says LaRowe, adding that busy moms might try to reduce multitasking. ""The simplest of child-care tasks, like bathing, diaper changing or feeding, can provide wonderful bonding opportunities."" Sarah is, of course, also a pro. ""The reality is that many nannies do have more parenting skills than parents,"" says LaRowe. ""For a mom to realize that someone else can meet her child's needs faster is hard. Parenting.com: How becoming a mom changes you . And what if your kid just seems to love the nanny more than she loves you? Unlikely, says LaRowe. Kids may cry when the nanny leaves or even call her mama, but mothers shouldn't see this behavior as a potential ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" moment where a sitter is trying to steal your family. ""Developmentally, once a baby says dada and mama, they say it about everything and everyone. They're just babbling,"" explains LaRowe. Think of it this way: For many multitasking modern moms like Davis, a nanny can be a life raft. After all, the hit show about child-care providers is called ""Nanny 911"", not It's Nice To Have A Nanny. The key is to trust your caregiver -- and give yourself a break. In many ways, you're bettering the life of your child by giving her a greater circle of loving caregivers. Says LaRowe, ""Early interactions with a loving, nurturing and consistent caregiver can teach a child about forming non-familial relationships that foster healthy self-esteem. A baby can never receive too much love. And since many nannies take on other household tasks, you may be able to check the children's laundry, meal preparation and grocery shopping off your list."" That might give you more time to make up for any daytime cuddles you're missing. Says LaRowe, ""Don't worry, a child always knows who her mom is."" Parenting.com: 6 new-mom confidence boosters .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The use of powerful drugs to treat complaints of chronic pain, and the faking of names on prescriptions for celebrities are central issues in the trial of Anna Nicole Smith's last two doctors and her lawyer-boyfriend. A Los Angeles County jury heard opening statements Wednesday in the trial of Howard K. Stern and Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor, charged in a conspiracy to provide drugs to an addict. A defense lawyer said Smith was not a drug addict, but was a victim of chronic pain who was seeking relief. The doctors, who never found the cause of her pain, were doing their best to relieve it with drugs, while her boyfriend, Stern, was going along with their treatment plan. The use of fakes names was a routine way to hide Smith's medical information from prying tabloid journalists who would pay medical workers to leak it, Steve Sadow, Stern's defense lawyer, told jurors. ""It's not a murder case,"" Sadow said. ""It's a prescribing medications case."" The prosecutor outlined the last three years of Smith's life, which ended in a Florida hotel room because of ""acute combined drug intoxication"" on February 8, 2007. The three defendants illegally conspired to fuel the actress-model's drug addiction with excessive amounts of powerful medications, Deputy District Attorney Renee Rose said. The doctors crossed legal and professional boundaries because they were captivated by Smith's fame, Rose said. ""We trust doctors to act responsibly... even in spite of ourselves,"" Rose said. Kapoor began prescribing painkilling opiates and anti-anxiety benzodiazepines to Smith in 2004, Rose said. He used the alias ""Michelle Smith"" on the opiate prescriptions, she said. Eroshevich, a psychiatrist, also was prescribing powerful drugs to Smith using fake names, Rose said. Stern ""facilitated"" the prescriptions, sometimes calling the doctors and picking them up from the pharmacy, Rose said. He was motivated by the millions he would gain if she won a court battle against her deceased husband's heirs, Rose said. Anna Nicole Smith's appearance on the 2004 American Music Awards telecast showed how she was affected by the drugs, she said. Jurors watched a video clip which opened with Smith asking, ""Like my body?"" Smith was not a drug addict, Sadow said. She sought the medications for ""real pain, constant pain, chronic pain."" ""She took the prescription medicines for her pain, primarily due to the inadequate control of pain,"" Sadow said. ""No physician was ever able to determine why she had pain."" Stern, who is a lawyer but not a doctor, ""relied on the good faith of the medical judgment of the doctors,"" Sadow said. ""He relied on their judgment of what was medically necessary for Anna."" It could not be a conspiracy because Stern did not know it was wrong or that using false names on prescriptions was illegal, Sadow said. ""Celebrities in Hollywood use aliases all the time,"" he said. Sadow said Kapoor was giving the same drugs and used the same alias as her previous doctor, whose practice he bought. That doctor has not been charged. Other doctors also used false names for Smith, including at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center when Smith was treated in 2006, he said. ""Every time she would have interaction with the medical community, it was under a different name,"" he said. Her identity was not secret to the pharmacist who regularly filled her prescriptions, he said, but Smith feared medical workers would sell her information. ""She was fodder for the paparazzi and that's where 'Michelle Chase' came in,"" Sadow said. The trial is expected to last up to three months.","Smith's doctors are charged with using fake names on drug prescriptions .
