"Harry Redknapp has questioned the commitment of young English players to the national team cause, claiming there were certain individuals during his time at Tottenham who tried to find ways of skipping international duty. The QPR boss described the Italy and Uruguay teams who had knocked England out of the World Cup as 'average' and claimed England had more talent at their disposal than any other team in Group D. England will fly home after playing Costa Rica in their final group game on Tuesday. Redknapp - once a strong contender for the England job only to see Roy Hodgson picked ahead of him in 2012 - said he had been unimpressed by their opponents and could not understand how England had failed to deliver. Tough night: Gerrard and Phil Jagielka look on dejected during England's World Cup defeat to Uruguay . Common problem: Redknapp claims that England boss Roy Hodgson will have dealt with the same issue while working at club level . He highlighted his experiences of managing England players while at Tottenham and recalled how some were very reluctant to represent their country. 'I still think we go to tournaments, whether it be under-17s, under-19s, under-21s, there are too many pull-outs, it seems to be everyone has got an excuse, and I can tell you when I was at Tottenham, when full internationals came around, there were two or three players who did not want to play for England,' he told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. 'They would come to me 10 days before the game and say, 'Gaffer, get me out of that game, I don't want to play in that game'. That was how it was. I'd say, 'you're playing for your country, you should want to play'. '(They would say) 'Nah, my girlfriend is having a baby in four weeks, I don't want to play' and that is the truth, so it makes you wonder. Only going to get worse? Redknapp believes more players will look to avoid playing for England in the future . 'And I think it's only going to get worse. You see the stick the England players get and they come home, they're earning fantastic money at their clubs, they're all playing in the Champions League. They think, ""Do we need the aggro?""' Difficult to hear: Matt Le Tissier said Redknapp's comments 'sticks a knife through your heart' Matthew Le Tissier, who won only eight England caps in his career, said Redknapp's revelation 'sticks a knife through your heart'. But Redknapp, who gave his backing to Hodgson, could offer no other explanation for England's failure to reach the knock-out stages as he described Group D as 'not a difficult group'. 'For Costa Rica to top the group by beating Italy and Uruguay, that tells you all you need to know about the group,' he added. 'For me it's the worst Italy team for years. Uruguay have two world-class strikers but then not too many players you'd fancy in the Premier League, let alone playing for your country. 'We've got good players, players who are good week-in, week-out in the Premier League. You look at half the other teams in the tournament and there are loads of players who come to the Premier League and couldn't get a game... You know we've got better players than them but for some reason with good manager after good manager, we just don't get results.' Asked about Football Association chairman Greg Dyke's target of winning the 2022 World Cup, Redknapp was dismissive. 'Good luck,' he said. 'Are we kidding? How are we going to go to Doha and win a World Cup in heat we'll struggle just to run around in? Not a prayer.'","Harry Redknapp has questioned commitment of young English players .

The chant was originally created, according to Yahoo, by Naval Academy Prep school student Jay Rodriguez, who taught it to his class-mates. In the 16 years since, it has spread from American university campuses to navy football matches and now the greatest show on earth in Brazil. It . may not be the most creative of chants but it is certainly catchy and . undoubtedly goose-bumping.

"Entering the charts of Andy Murray’s most convincing wins in his Grand Slam career, straight into the top three, goes Blaz Rola. The defending champion was utterly ruthless in trouncing the 23-year-old Slovenian in just 84 minutes to reach the third round and put himself on track, you would expect, for the second week. Murray’s next opponent will be Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut, the world No 23, and it is unlikely to be as straightforward as the exhibition put on for grateful Court One patrons in this unusual lunchtime spot. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Williamson and Kelner Wimbledon day three update . Victory: Andy Murray celebrates with a clenched fist after seeing off Blaz Rola in style . Cruise: Murray enjoyed a simple workout on Court One against Rola on Wednesday . All too easy: Murray volleys a winner into the empty court with Rola out of sight and out of the point . Yet in this form Murray can be . expected to progress, for he asserted the kind of crushing superiority . you so regularly see in early rounds from Novak Djokovic and Rafael . Nadal. The world No 5 does . not possess the threshing machine mentality of his two main rivals, . which often sees them reach the latter part of tournaments with plenty . in reserve. Murray is aware . of that and set his mind to schooling the standout player from the . highly competitive American college circuit of last year, who will play . much better than this with a few more outings on grass. This . was Murray’s easiest victory at Wimbledon, surpassing the first round . of 2012 when he allowed Russia’s Nikolay Davydenko only six games. Given . that grass tends to offer more free points for the server than other . surfaces, it is highly unusual that anyone is cleaned up as . comprehensively as poor Rola was on Wednesday. A . lot of it was about energy conservation and making this obligatory . visit to Court One — it is only right that no player gets a season . ticket on Centre Court — impressively brief. Murray . had a recent reminder of how important it is not to get bogged down in . early rounds at the French Open where, slightly leg weary, he found . himself on the wrong end of a severe tonking from Nadal in the . semi-finals. Serving up a treat: Murray sends down a missile to his Slovenian opponent . Breezing through: Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears arrives at Wimbledon (left) and watches the match (right) Good start: Murray's new coach Amelie Mauresmo watches her charge in action on Wednesday .

Royal approval: The Duchess of Cornwall (centre right) smiles as she watches Murray in action . 806: Combined rankings of Tara Moore and Vera Zvonareva. Russian is 566 due to injury lay-off . 7: David Ferrer is the highest men's seed to go out . 83: Roberto Bautista Agut, Murray’s next opponent, had highest percentage of successful first serves . 2: Number of British players that are left in singles action . 7: Years since Martina Hingis played at SW19. She made her return aged 33 in the doubles . 46: Venus Williams and Victoria Azarenka hit the most winners . 2: Twice in two days Benoit Paire has been knocked out: in singles and doubles. He says he ‘hates’ SW19 . 42: Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov broke his own record for aces in a single match . ‘I’m not saying I would have beaten Rafa but it cost me there, playing lots of long matches,’ he reflected. ‘Against . Philipp Kohlschreiber (in the third round) I was up in every set and it . eventually went to 12-10 in the fifth. So it’s important to get through . these matches as quickly as possible.’ A . good barometer of how straightforward a Murray match has been at . Wimbledon is the type of questions he has to field afterwards: the more . off-piste they are indicating just how comfortable a day it has been. And . so he was asked if was he pleased the Duchess of Cornwall had taken a . diversion from the Royal Box to watch his match. Yes. What did he think . of Luis Suarez biting Giorgio Chiellini? Unnatural behaviour. Pleased . with Alan Stubbs’s appointment as Hibernian manager? Again, yes. Is . he concerned that LeBron James rejected a new contract with Miami Heat? It does not necessarily mean the team’s marquee player will be leaving. Then . there was the retelling of how he rescued a large dog from traffic . after it has strayed on to the road near his Surrey home earlier in the . week. More connected to . tennis was his view about whether another Slovenian, Aljaz Bedene, . should be allowed to switch nationalities and play in the Davis Cup for . Great Britain. ‘I don’t . really mind,’ he said. ‘If he becomes a British citizen and is able to . play then I see no reason why he shouldn’t be able to do it. I don’t . make the rules.’ Having to . answer diverse enquiries is an encouraging symptom for Murray, who was . also questioned about how it is going with Amelie Mauresmo. He reverted to his stock reply of ‘so far, so good’. Brit of alright: Fans packed out Henman Hill (or is it Murray Mount?) to watch the defending champion on TV . See you on Friday: The defending champion salutes the crowd after his victory . This . certainly appears to be the case and if you talk to those within his . camp they confirm that she has settled in very comfortably with the . long-established group around him. There . were also some encouraging clues in his match, even though Rola found . his natural timing difficult to come by on the grass when being fed so . many types of different spins and angles by a master of the surface. One . good sign was that when the Slovenian created his three break points, . one in each set, they were answered with strong first serves, two of . them being aces. You still . fear that less awed players will do some damage to Murray’s second . delivery but that was never really an issue in this match. The . most animated the crowd got was when a ball fell out of the Scot’s . pocket in the second set, causing the rally to be replayed — it was that . kind of afternoon.","Murray beat Blaz Rola in straight sets in Wimbledon second round .

"Top plus-size model Melissa Aronson, better known as Emme, is making a return to fashion at the age of 51. The former Fashion Emergency host, who battled and overcame Stage 2a Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2007, has recently been signed to Muse Models and is in the midst of launching several initiatives promoting the representation of plus size women in the fashion industry. 'Lululemon stops at size 12,' she told WWD as an example, explaining: 'If you want to get people healthy, you're going to need clothes to do it.' Comeback: Melissa Aronson, better known as Emme (pictured in  June) is considered fashion's first and most famous plus-size model. Now she is making a return to fashion at the age of 51 . One of Emme's current projects is Fashion Without Limits, which encourages design students at her alma mater Syracuse University to create apparel in size 12 and up. The students will compete to create an evening dress for the model, with the winner receiving a $500 prize and the opportunity to see the design worn by Emme at a red carpet event. 'We wanted to go and educate the new designers and teach them how to drape on a large-size body, whether she's a little older or a more youthful junior,' says the mother-of-one, who has a 12-year-old daughter, Toby, with her ex-husband Philip. Making moves: One of Emme's current projects is an initiative called Fashion Without Limits, which encourages design students at Syracuse to create apparel in size 12 and up. Pictured: Emme in the 90s . Breaking boundaries: Emma became the first plus-size model signed to cosmetics brand Revlon in 1998 . What's more, she also has plans to launch an athleticwear line that offers plus sizes, including swimwear, sportswear, knits and footwear. '[Currently, most designers] just go up to 12 or 14. I don't know why,' she said. 'There might be a stigma that is undeniably present. It's really the unspoken truth. I see such an opportunity.' She is also working with brand innovation firm Graj + Gustavsen on plus-size apparel and accessories. Emme says she does feel that the options and opportunities for plus-size women has grown since her modelling heyday in the Eighties and Nineties. Progress: Emme (pictured in a 1994 Hanes ad) does feel that the options and opportunities for plus-size women has grown since her modelling heyday in the Eighties and Nineties . 'The game is online for full-figured women. Major department stores are now playing that [online] game,' she said. As for big brands who are making the most of the as of yet untapped market, Emme praises Michael Michael Kors, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Asos and Calvin Klein. Despite all the progress, however, the fashion industry still has a ways to go. 'The whole plethora of personality is not being tapped,' she said. 'Just because she's a plus-size woman does not mean she is matronly.'","One of Emme's current projects is Fashion Without Limits, which encourages design students at Syracuse University to create apparel in size 12 and up .

"As Argentina and Germany prepare to battle it out in the Maracana, who should you be cheering? ROB DRAPER is behind Lionel Messi and the South Americans, while IAN LADYMAN is backing Joachim Low and his team. Who will you be supporting? There’s one easy reason to support Argentina: Lionel Messi. The Holland manager, Louis van Gaal, had a plan to subdue him in the semi-final but in every other match so far Messi has been playing on a level far above the other 21 players on the pitch. Perhaps the clip of the World Cup is Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama jokingly complaining to referee Nicola Rizzoli that he is giving Messi too many free-kicks. VIDEO Scroll down to watch We're underdogs  - Aguero . Horseplay: Vincent Enyeama and Lionel Messi share a moment during their group match . A cool head: Messi converts Argentina's first penalty to give them a lead that they would not relinquish . Carrying the weight of a nation: Lionel Messi (left) and his team-mates charge after Maxi Rodriguez scored the winning penalty against Holland . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi highlights . 1 If it wasn’t for them, there would be no Evita. 2 They have a Harrods in Buenos Aires and there’s an Anglo-Argentine Society in London to promote better relations, apparently by holding BBQs (asados). Still not working though, is it? 3 They are not Germany and don’t send their wives down before breakfast to put towels on all the best sunloungers. ‘I know he makes your job hard,’ says Rizzoli. Enyeama just rolls his eyes, shakes his head and breaks into a broad smile. ‘He’s so good!’ he says. When even the opposition goalkeeper can take pleasure in your brilliance, you have achieved something truly universal — something that can be appreciated beyond the allegiances of club and country. But there’s another reason why England supporters should consider supporting Argentina. If you have any love of English fan culture and the ability our fans have to support teams through thick and thin, following home and away whatever the  difficulty, then you will appreciate Argentinian football fans. They have been by far the largest travelling contingent here, for obvious geographical reasons. They have also been by far the most passionate and vocal, with a range of chants and songs — mostly aimed at Brazil, but with admittedly one or two directed at England — that few countries, other than the home nations, would match. Fervent fans: Argentina's support at the World Cup has been phenominal . Blonde ambition: Argentina fans pose before their semi-final... and they will be hoping for a similar outcome in the Maracana . VIDEO We're underdogs - Aguero . I once saw Boca Juniors play at their home ground, the Bombonera, against their hated rivals River Plate. It was a calamity of a game for Boca, who lost 3-0 at home in what was their most important game of the season. The River Plate supporters, all 10,000 of them, were revelling in the victory with 20 minutes to go. Having seen Spanish and Italian fans in similar circumstances, I had in mind a certain reaction, expecting the Boca supporters either to walk out or start hurling abuse or missiles at their team. Instead, for a full 20 minutes, all 40,000 of them — from those in the posh seats to the terraces — stood and continuously chanted about how much they loved Boca and how they would never stop supporting them. Spine tingling: The Bombonera has a partisan atmosphere all of its own . Talk about the passion: Diego Maradona celebrates a Boca goal against River Plate in 2006 . It brings to mind England fans applauding the team at the end of this World Cup. Only in Britain and Argentina do football fans behave like this. Despite our differences, we have much more in common than we think. Good teams start tournaments well and get even better. Germany have managed both those things — as they often do — and that is why I think they will win this World Cup and why I would like them to. Germany’s record in the opening games of World Cups is remarkable. They have won their first match in the last seven tournaments. Compare that to the way England often seem to stumble into major championships and it begins to look even more impressive. German teams know how to approach these tournaments, physically and mentally. Their big players come off long, taxing seasons with their clubs but manage to bring their true selves to the World Cup. Strong start: Thomas Muller hits the fourth as Portugal were put to the sword . Powerhouse: German chancellor Angela Merkel was in jubilant mood in Salvador . 1 If it wasn’t for them there would be no Dads’ Army or ’Allo ’Allo. 2 They invented some great kids’ stuff, including Gummy Bears and Fanta. Also, Germans wrote Grimms’ Fairy Tales — which are a great way to give your children nightmares after scoffing all those E numbers. 3 They are not Argentina and don’t want the Falklands (as far as we know). Meanwhile, their bit-part players — the likes of Miroslav Klose, Mario Gotze and Lukas Podolski — do not become disenfranchised by the lack of a starting guarantee. They travel motivated, energetic and ready to contribute when called upon. In the most part, that’s what they do. Look at Klose. Has there ever been a more absolute World Cup footballer? Arguably, he has never been an A-list European striker. He has never been chased  particularly hard by clubs in the Barclays Premier League, for example. He is 36 now and playing for Lazio. But he scored a vital equaliser against Ghana with his first touch of this World Cup as a substitute and is now expected to start in the final. A man for all seasons: Miroslav Klose hits Germany level against Ghana to rescue a point . Smells like team spirit: Lukas Podolski regularly tweets images of a delighted Germany squad behind closed doors . Things like that say much for talent and the knack of a goal-scorer but also for the understanding of tournament football that seems to come naturally to German players. This is not a brilliant German football team. Only two or three — Bastian Schweinsteiger, Manuel Neuer and perhaps Philipp Lahm — would get into famous German teams of yore. Nevertheless, they are talented enough in key areas and function brilliantly as a unit. They are managed shrewdly and without fuss by Joachim Low and are mentally resolute enough to cope with anything, as they showed in their semi-final against a Brazil team hyped to their eyeballs on false notions of destiny. The last line of defence: Manuel Neuer has shown he is arguably the best keeper in the world . History beckons? Philipp Lahm will hope to follow Fritz Walter, Franz Beckenbauer and Lothar Matthaus as German captains to lift the World Cup . One last thing that draws me to this German team is that, one day, this could be England. Low doesn’t have a Messi or Ronaldo to call on. His team hasn’t been dragged along by God-given genius. It’s a football team full of good players who know what they’re doing. Is there really any reason why — some day soon — England cannot mimic that?","Two of England's biggest rivals meet in the Maracana as Argentina face narrow favourites Germany .

"A 12-year-old boy left critically injured following a deliberate house fire in South Yorkshire has died from his injuries, police confirmed. Jack Sykes died in hospital last night, less than a week after his father Darren, 44, and brother Paul, nine, died in the fire in Penistone in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. Police investigating the tragedy said evidence confirmed that the fire was 'started deliberately' and that an accelerant was used. Jack Sykes, 12, (right) has died in hospital from the critical injuries he sustained in the house fire which killed his father Darren, 44, (centre) and his nine-year-old brother Jack (left) in Penistone, Barnsley, South Yorkshire . Police confirmed the fire last Wednesday was started deliberately with an accelerated and officers stressed they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. Pictured: Mr Sykes with his two sons . Officers stressed that they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident and it is feared that Mr Sykes – who recently separated from his wife and mother of the two boys – was behind the incident. The youngster's heartbroken mother Claire, 42, was at her son's bedside when he passed away. Neighbours said flames suddenly swept through the semi-detached house at around 6.30pm last Wednesday. The boys were staying with their carpet salesman father, and firemen found all three occupants on the first floor after they entered the building wearing breathing apparatus. Neighbours added that they heard no screams or cries for help from inside. Post mortem examinations confirmed that the victims' injuries were 'consistent with being involved in a fire'. Barrie Hall, 73, a retired security officer, said he was returning from a nearby park when he saw 'acrid smoke coming out of the house'. He said the 'fire brigade came and started sorting it out' and police told local residents to go inside. Jack (left) and Paul (right) had been staying with their salesman father, who recently split from their mother . Broken and blackened brown window frames could be seen at the house following the tragedy on Wednesday . The fire which ravaged the semi-detached house in South Yorkshire was started deliberately with accelerant . He said: 'We didn't know until later that anybody was in there It was a shock. It's terrible. It just blows you away.' Mr Hall said the family had lived there together until the boys left with their mother at some point in the past few months. 'Mr Sykes lived there on his own, I believe they were separated,' he said, adding that Mr Sykes adored his children. 'He loved his kids. You'd hear him playing with them all the time. I would say was he was a bigger kid than his kids.' South Yorkshire Police today confirmed Jack had succumbed to his critical injuries. A spokesman said: 'A 12-year-old boy left critically ill following a house fire in Penistone has died as a result of his injuries. 'Emergency services were called to a house on Tennyson Close at around 6.30pm on Wednesday, October 22. A man and his two sons were rescued from the property by firefighters. 'Darren Sykes, 44, and his nine-year-old son Paul Sykes both died as a result of the fire. 'His older son Jack Sykes was taken to hospital in a critical condition but lost his fight for life last night. Flowers were attached to nine-year-old Paul's school gates with the message: 'You will be sadly missed' People arrived at the scene in Penistone, South Yorkshire, to leave flowers for Mr Sykes and his sons .

'Detectives investigating the fire have confirmed it was started deliberately and that an accelerant was used. Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. 'The investigation continues on behalf of the coroner.' Jack attended Penistone Grammar School and Paul was a pupil at Springvale Primary School, also in Penistone. After Paul's death, headteacher Andy Platt said: 'Following the recent tragic events in Penistone, all of us at Springvale Primary School wish to offer our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Paul Sykes at this very difficult time . 'Paul was an outgoing, popular boy who was blossoming into a fine runner and cornet player. He will be greatly missed.

"So comprehensive were their victories, and so enticing a prospect, that it was difficult to resist wondering about a quarter-final meeting between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova as they each completed demolition jobs on Thursday. Combined, the pair lost just five games, won 108 points out of 165, and spent no more than one hour and 49 minutes on Court No 1, almost as if neither much fancied exposing their bodies to the summer chill for very long. Williams was quicker, beating Chanelle Scheepers 6-1, 6-1 in 49 minutes — the third shortest time at these Championships — and afterwards claimed she still had improvements to make. Stars: Both Sharapova (left) and Williams (right) won with ease and the two could meet in the quarter-final . Not so stretching: Sharapova is made to work for a point but ran out a very comfortable winner . Focus: Serena Williams says there is more to come from her but she looked in ruthless form . The five-time champion bore the attitude of someone carrying out a tiresome household chore as she swatted the ball this way and that to send the 30-year-old South African on shuttle runs of futile purpose. If Williams can focus her mind you imagine more challenging tasks that await will be similarly conquered. There were trademark returns slapped back with interest and a couple of aces measuring 113mph and 115mph to entertain the crowd. She was a prickly presence in the press conference which  followed, at one point asking when it would be over, but  perhaps that was due to lack of sleep having only finished a  doubles match with sister Venus the previous evening at 8.59pm. Serena took a tumble into the crowd during that win — ‘I had some lovely gents able to break my fall’ — and added: ‘I felt okay today. I don’t want to feel great necessarily right now because hopefully I have several more matches I can play. ‘The goal for me is just to feel a little better every day. Struggle: Sharapova has not won the Wimbledon title since beating Serena Williams as a 17-year-old in 2004 . ‘It’s important not to peak too soon, keep working on your game, always have room for improvement. ‘I feel there’s some things I still want to work on to hopefully stay in the tournament.’ Williams can equal Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova’s haul of 18 Grand Slam titles if she wins here  — her last major came at the US Open last September — and even at 32, she has a growing appetite for success. ‘It is stronger than ever,’ she said. ‘I have desire to do more.’ Sharapova is five years younger but just as experienced and  hungry. The pair met in the Wimbledon final of 2004, which the Russian won aged only 17, but she has not lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish since. Last year she was knocked out in the second round, falling, quite literally, to Michelle Larcher de Brito, who was then world No 131. Runaway: Williams beet South African Chanelle Scheepers in just 49 minutes - the third fastest win this year . Timea Bacsinszky, world No 85, presented no such challenge yesterday, beaten 6-2, 6-1 as Sharapova extended her lithe limbs to reach devious angles and get speed across the grass. With a second French Open in her bag, Sharapova is on form and a threat. But Serena’s shadow is already looming. ‘We have played each other many times,’ said Sharapova, who has a 16-2 losing record against the American. ‘I always look forward to that challenge to play against the best, try something a little bit different to get a win out there.’ First up in round three is  Alison Riske, a 23-year-old American, who has already scalped a seed here. For Williams, it is 25th seed Alize Cornet, a French player who beat her more esteemed competitor on the hard courts of Dubai earlier this season.","Sharapova and Williams dropped just 5 games between them .

"For 88 minutes on Sunday evening, there may have been something uncomfortably familiar about this Holland performance for the watching Manchester United supporters. Shorn of ideas and deprived of pace, Louis van Gaal’s team increasingly resorted to high and speculative balls forward. Whisper it quietly, but this rather felt as though we were watching the Manchester United of the David Moyes incarnation all over again. The similarities even extended to Robin van Persie, Van Gaal’s most trusted on-field lieutenant, failing to show. On this occasion, though, one imagines that the Dutchman did not have a statement prepared for the post-match mixed zone alleging that his team-mates are ‘often playing in my zones’, as he did after Manchester United’s dreadful 2-0 defeat by Olympiacos. Under Van Gaal, he simply would not dare. VIDEO Scroll down to watch fiery Van Gaal lose his temper during Holland training . The comeback kings: Louis van Gaal celebrates as Holland beat Mexico late on to progress to the last eight . Not his day: Robin van Persie's performance mirrored one of his poor displays for United last season . VIDEO Dutch party rumbles on . Nonetheless, in the searing heart, Holland seemed rudderless and leaderless. The midfield bulldog Nigel De Jong had succumbed to injury. Captain Van Persie had been hooked with fifteen minutes to go. For all intents and purposes, this Holland team looked finished. Over 4,000 miles away at Carington, they may have been dusting down the black leather chair in the manager’s office to prepare for Van Gaal’s arrival. And then it happened, inexplicably and unpredictably. Maybe we should have known better. After all, Holland have won three of their four games in this World Cup having trailed at some point in the game. Spain, Australia and now Mexico have all fallen under an illusion of comfort, only to be brutally struck down. In Manchester, a wry smile may have curled on to the faces of those who make the weekly pilgrimage to Old Trafford. They have seen teams with this kind of spirit before. Holland’s mettle was impressive, their refusal to go quietly from this magnificent World Cup admirable. Fergie-time may have competition. Throw in an injury-time penalty strewn with controversy and there’s a peculiar sense of deja-vu. Feeling down: David Moyes looks dejected on the sidelines as he sees United lose again . Making a difference: Van Gaal gives instructions as Holland came from behind to win . Famous pose: United were known for stunning late comebacks in Sir Alex Ferguson's time at the club . Louis van Gaal’s similarities with Sir Alex Ferguson would appear to go beyond an authoritative discipline and an aversion to speaking openly with the Press. The best managers inspire incomparable loyalty, the kind that sees substitutes such as Klass-Jan Huntelaar, who had not played a single minute so far at this World Cup, emerge from the bench to win the football match almost single-handedly, creating one for Wesley Sneijder and then scoring the winning strike from the penalty spot. In Salford parlance, they  know it as doing a ‘Teddy Sheringham’, remembering the forward’s contribution on that evening in the Nou Camp in 1999. Bold move: Van Gaal took off Van Persie and the move worked as Holland came back to win . They will recognise, also, the courage to make the unpopular decision. How would Van Persie have reacted to his manager if Holland failed to win following his substitution? What would be the repercussions as Van Gaal begins his Manchester United career? Frankly, Van Gaal showed little regard. His mind was made up. Egos will not be indulged when the success of the team is at stake. If only Moyes had displayed such courage in his convictions. One gloomy Saturday afternoon in December immediately sprang to mind on Sunday evening, when Manchester United were defeated 1-0 by Newcastle. Van Persie was evidently off-the-pace, his performance justifying a change. Moyes feared the consequences, stating: ‘I think if I’d brought him off some people would say ‘What are you doing? You are 1-0 down and you’re taking off your top goalscorer.’ Not going to plan: Van Persie did not have a great game and was taken off in the second half . Off the pace: Van Persie had a bad game when United lost to Newcastle back in December . The Glaswegian never could discover the key to that magic box of comebacks at Old Trafford, his players disaffected and uncommitted as the clock ticked down on his traumatic reign. The Champions he inherited became timid lambs, trading in domestic domination for a startling neurosis. After Sir Alex Ferguson’s 27 years in the managerial chair, we assumed that United players were on auto-pilot, that those qualities of utter determination, self-sacrifice and loyalty to the shirt were self-perpetuating. For nine months, it all dissipated. Alls well that ends well: Van Persie applauds the fans at the end after Holland progressed . Under Moyes, United recovered to win after falling behind on just four occasions out of twenty. The season before, United had reversed deficits to win eleven times before Boxing Day alone. Manchester United supporters may have felt those breathless moments were now confined to the DVD’s of the glorious yesteryears. Van Gaal’s stirring crescendo on the grandest stage will assure the rank-and-file that there will be many more of those epic times to come.","Holland win in Fergie time with a controversial penalty .

"Andy Murray logged into Twitter last month and described Nick Kyrgios as the ‘next big Aussie star’. It turns out he might have sold him short. What happened on Centre Court on Tuesday night — the demolition of Rafael Nadal by a 19-year-old wildcard — was quite remarkable in a global sense. He started with an ace and closed the show four sets later with another. In between there were a further 35, and 70 winners from the world No 144. It was astonishing.

Jim Courier here in 1992 had a player from outside the top 100 beaten a . world No 1 at a Grand Slam. To . be clear, Nadal did not play badly. Instead, this was about a fearless . player with grass-court tools who never stopped going for the big shot. The surprise was that this Australian, who travels with an Xbox and . whose mother gave him no chance against Nadal,  sustained such levels . against this particular man. Nadal . is the immovable object, an obdurate beast who chases all lost causes. Not many players can wait out the temperamental storms of talent quite . like the Spaniard.

This was his first time on Centre Court, a . man leading a charmed life having already been brought back from the . dead by a Hawk-Eye call when facing match point in the second round. Everything . he did was done with joy. When he was broken for the only time, in the . second set, he smirked. When he pulled off the shot of the Championships . — a winner played from between his legs, or a hotdog, if you prefer — . at 3-3 in the second, he grinned for two minutes. He described his . celebratory dance at the end as a ‘juicy wiggle’. His . only frown came when he  discussed his mother’s lack of faith. ‘I just . believed in myself and believed that I could create some opportunities,’ he said. Kyrgios’s response, quite aside from providing the shock of the tournament, was to text his mother a smiley face. Glum: Nadal looks down as he reacts to the press after the defeat . Pressure: Things just didn't go Nadal's way on Wednesday as the French Open champion crashed out . From . the start, he carried the confidence of someone with  considerably more . experience. While Nadal ran from the coin toss to the baseline to begin . his fidgety routine of tics and outfit adjustments, Kyrgios sauntered. He waved to someone in the crowd. Then . came the bombardment. He opened with an ace and, as someone once touted . as a professional basketball player, he walked the baseline bouncing . the ball between his legs. He held to love and would lose only four . points on his serve in the opening set, which he took on a tiebreak. The . clinching shot? An ace. For . an hour and 32 minutes,  Kyrgios sustained the same extreme level . without a single  significant wobble. Then, serving at 5-6 in the . second, he cracked a little and fluffed two straight- forward volleys . for 0-30. He fought his way back into the game, surviving a set point, . but at the second opportunity Nadal took it when Kyrgios hit into the . net. That should have been that. That should have been Kyrgios’s cue to leave politely, as Nadal’s previous three opponents had. Feeling the heat: Nadal came up against an inspired opponent as the teenager triumphed . Instead, . he won the third set on a tiebreak and broke Nadal to lead 3-1 in the . fourth. That became 5-3 and the magnitude of the occasion hit Kyrgios. He hit it back. ‘You know if you believe in yourself you’re going to have a pretty good shot to close out a match,’ he said. He did just that, with his 37th ace of an extraordinary contest. Kyrgios, . like many players his age, grew up idolising Roger  Federer. He had the . fortune of practising with him at the French Open — now he might face . him in the Wimbledon semi-finals. For . Nadal, there was a trace of uncharacteristic bitterness in his muted . praise for a teenager who played in the juniors last year and was on the . Challenger tour as recently as two weeks ago. ‘Everything . is a little bit easier when you are arriving,’ said Nadal, who lost to . Steve Darcis in the first round last year and to Lukas Rosol in the . second round the year before. ‘You . have nothing to lose.’  Now Kyrgios has everything to gain with a . quarter-final on Wednesday against Milos Raonic, who until now held an . advantage over him in the ‘next big thing’ stakes.

But the new evidence suggests that the livestock version is capable of being transmitted from animals to humans . Three samples of the drug-resistant bacteria taken from a hospital and neo-natal unit in Scotland closely matched a specific strain found in livestock . Study leader Dr Melissa Ward, from the University of Edinburgh, said: 'Our findings emphasise the need for strict biosecurity practices in the food production industry, as well as continued surveillance and infection control of MRSA in hospitals. 'Responsible use of antibiotics in healthcare settings and agriculture is of utmost importance.' MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is a serious hazard in hospitals and nursing homes. The CC398 strain is known to cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections in both humans and animals. In dairy herds, it has been linked to cases of bovine mastitis. Dr Ward's team unravelled the full genetic codes of British CC398 samples and compared them with published genetic data on the same bugs from humans and livestock around the world. The research showed that the strain had entered the UK on several occasions since the mid-1940s, but the original source of the bacteria remained unclear. The most significant evidence of animal-to-human transmission came from three genetic sequences of MRSA collected in Scotland.

"From an Italian prince and a Spanish gigolo to a Russian billionaire and a priest at the Vatican, Bambi Smyth has certainly 'dated' her fair share of interesting men. In fact, the 55-year-old from Melbourne spent three months going on 75 blind dates in 22 countries - and it was all in a mission to find 'The One'. Ms Smyth's jam-packed itinerary  led her to dine with some 'extraordinary and interesting' men, which she then tried to match with a dish unique to their culture. Scroll down for video . Bambi Smyth spent three months going on 75 blind dates in 22 countries - and it was all in a mission to find 'The One . 'It was a cross between speed dating and a smorgasbord,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was trying to get to know as many (men) as I could, but sometimes I only had one day in a country and I was meeting with two or three men.' 'It was hard work, but exciting too.' Of her 75 dates, an Italian Stallion named Stefano topped Ms Smyth's list. 'Stefano was one of the most extraordinary men I've met. He's a naval architect and he was charm on steroids,' she said. 'He was the most interesting man, generous of nature, highly intelligent and very warm. 'To say I fell head over heels for him is an understatement.' Bambi, who was 47 at the time, travelled to 22 different countries, including the Arab United Emirates to dine with various men . But, like several of the men Ms Smyth met on her travels, Stefano was married. Ms Smyth decided to combine her search for love with gaining an insight into the cultural differences involved in dating and she chronicled her adventures for her new book, Men On The Menu. Before leaving Melbourne, Ms Smyth emailed everyone she knew telling them she was writing a book about food and men and needed a 'date' in various countries. She said they should be 'preferably single' and aged roughly between 25 to 55. In a matter of two weeks she had a list of blind dates across the world. But not all were what she expected. 'There was a fellow in Hungary who was kind enough to cook dinner for me in his small apartment,' she said. 'He was chopping up chicken fillets in the kitchen... and he suddenly turns to me and says if I had another career I'd probably be a good serial killer because I like chopping and I'm very neat. 'Needless to say I was gripping my chair in this seventh floor apartment in god knows where.' Ms Smyth, pictured here with one of her Scottish dates Lorne, tried to match with a dish unique to their culture to the man she was dining with . Ms Smyth said her trip was filled with positive and negative dates, but she had no regrets . She also met a gigolo in Monaco. 'Well I'm 99 percent sure he was a gigolo. I was having a drink with a friend and he gestured for us to come over. He was asking how many stars our hotel had, obviously trying to work out how much money I had. 'I didn't fall for it, in case you're wondering.' In Germany, a man who took Ms Smyth to lunch thought it would be funny to feed her cheese that had less than desirable side effects. '(The cheese) was called The Musician... when I asked why and he ""You'll see"",' she said. 'I farted for three full days and by the end of it I could sound out the whole Oom Pah Pah. He was just watching me (eat) with a little smile on his face!' While her favourite date was in Italy with a man named Stefano, some dates left Ms Smyth with a sour taste in her mouth . Ms Smyth, who after 75 dates ended up meeting a man named Greg when she returned to Australia, said she opened up during the experience and learned a few things about herself . While her time in Italy with Stefano was the stuff dreams are made of, some dates left Ms Smyth with a sour taste in her mouth. 'In England, I was hoping for something interesting. My cousin had set me up with her ex-boyfriend Ben. But it was horrible. I think he told me I was stupid 37 times. I had to sit there while he was tearing me to shreds,' she said. 'Paulo was my very first date overseas in Brazil. He was a very weird person. He obviously didn't think I left a big enough tip so leant across and took more money out of my wallet. But then he sang to me… he tried to seduce me!' But Ms Smyth said she had no regrets during her whirlwind trip. Ms Smyth, who was the first Westerner Naoki from Japan had met, emailed basically everyone she knew telling them she was writing a book about food and men and needed a 'date' in various countries . She said she opened up during the experience of meeting random men, like Lorne from Scotland, and learned a few things about herself along the way . 'They were all interesting and worth recording. They all added some to the smorgasbord, even though some gave me indigestion,' she said. Ms Smyth, who after 75 dates ended up meeting a man named Greg when she returned to Australia, said she opened up during the experience and learned a few things about herself. 'I became less judgemental and became open to different possibilities. I went over lacking confidence but I ended up feeling good about myself,' she said. 'I've learned to give people an opportunity to show your true side... you definitely can't judge a book by its cover and you can't judge a man by his wallet.'

"How to solve a problem like Lionel Messi? That is the question which will test the tactical acumen of Louis van Gaal to the limit. And even if Van Gaal gets all his tactics spot on, Messi has the ability to wriggle out of any shackle in a split second and change the game. Scroll down for videos... Good spirits: Lionel Messi (left) jokes with Marcos Rojo (right) and Augusto Fernandez (centre) in training . Warming up for Lionel? Nigel de Jong on the ball ahead of Holland's World Cup semi-final against Argentina . Brutal: De Jong's infamous kung-fu kick on Xabi Alonso during the 2010 World Cup final . Perceived wisdom is that it is waste of time to man mark Messi, because the Argentine can lose that player in an instant then pull the rest of the team out of shape… or exploit his shadow by taking him out of the way to offer team-mates room. Howard Webb, who hopes take charge of the World Cup final on Sunday, admits he was wrong not show Nigel de Jong a red card for his horror tackle on Xabi Alonso in the final four years ago. ‘With hindsight I would change the call but I didn’t have a perfect viewing angle and with 25 minutes gone in the biggest game of our lives I wasn’t willing to take the risk,’ says Webb . If Webb does get the game on Sunday he would become the first ref to take charge of two finals. But the word is that if Argentina make it he definitely won’t be chosen given political sensitivities surround the Falklands. But given that Van Gaal is considering a recall for Nigel de Jong, he could well ask his acerbic midfielder to marshal Messi’s movement. Then again, the Dutch system of three central defender with two wing backs - 3-4-3 -would seem ideally suited to confront Messi. The semi ‘sweeper’ system - Ron Vlaar is more central centre back than libero - means that he, Stefan de Vrij or Bruno Martins Indi can all step out into the midfield pocket where Messi, stalks, often, walks around waiting for the ball, comfortable there is cover behind to cope with the forwards. If Holland’s three Lions keep their concentration and compress the space in front of them when Messi has the ball then he can be stopped. Given the resilient nature of the Argentina defence, it could unfold as an absorbing, chess-like tactical battle. Diego Maradona has acknowledged Lionel Messi as his heir. Former Argentina Ossie Ardiles argues Messi is better and he is certainly taller than Maradona, although not by much. Maradona stood 5ft 5in. Messi is 5ft 7in. Both are classic No 10s with a magic left foot. Messi has the name of his son Thiago tattooed to the calf of that wonderful left peg he uses like a conductor’s baton. Doting dad: Messi's left calf bears the name of his son, Thiago . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi . And just to remind you, he has scored 42 goals in 91 games for Argentina and 243 goals in 277 La Liga game for Barcelona. Maradona, who won the World Cup in 1986, scored 34 goals in 91 internationals and in a short period at Barcelona scored 22 goals in 36 games. This World Cup has been on a different planet to 2010 and the stats back that up. With three games to go there have been 166 goals scored compared to 138 four years ago. It’s not just been more attacking, there has been better finishing (excluding England, of course) which has been helped by a ball that they should stick with for next time. It’s been cleaner with better refereeing, just 169 yellow cards compared with 229 and 10 red cards compared with 16. Leading clubs are poised to agree PL proposal to introduce free-kick foam next season. An executive at a top club told Sportsmail: ‘I’m sure most clubs will vote for it. It has worked so well at the World Cup. It cuts out a lot of nonsense and gets the game going quicker.’ All I do each night is spray: Referee Ravshan Irmatov uses the special foam last week . Holland are heading for their fourth World Cup final - amazing for a relatively small country with a population of 17million . But behind England, Holland has the oldest league in the world. The Argentinian league has the third oldest league in the world. Argentina, population 42 million, have reached four finals and won two World Cups. Holland are aiming for their first trophy. Argentina played their first international game in 1901 when they beat Uruguay 3-2 fielding a team made up mainly of British émigrés. But they lost to Uruguay 4-2 in the first World Cup in 1930. Holland played at their first World Cup in 1934. One to watch: . All eyes will be on Lionel Messi and Arjen Robben. But the slightly less fashionable and not-quite-so easy-on-the-eye Dirk Kuyt could be key if Holland are to stop Messi and wear down the Argentina defence. Catch him if you can: Arjen Robben's pace will be key for Holland against Argentina . I-Say : . Uber Fussball: Wunderbar. They expected fireworks in the favelas but in the end it became a funeral pyre for Brazil. In so many ways the hosts got what they deserved. Having abandoned their romantic roots of stylish Samba football in favour of a mean, rough, win-at-all-costs approach insisted upon by Big Phil Scolari, they were simply outplayed by a group of superior players who were never going to be out muscled. Yes the absence Neymar and Thiago Silva made a difference. But in that respect it a case of bonfire of vanities. The Neymar fixation, right down to Scolari wearing a cap bearing his name when they arrived at the stadium, undermined them. Even when Pele was in his pomp the team did not rely so heavily on him… there were so many others who could play Jogo Bonito, such as Rivelino, Tostao, Gerson, Jairzinho etc. But having shelved the Samba approach Brazil didn’t have a clue what to do without Neymar and without Silva had no on field leadership. So what was left was the ashes of a Brazilian football team like we have never seen before as Germany won their semi final 7-1 in such a uber cool manner. Uber Fussball indeed. World Cup moment: . The images remain strong for those who recall the 1978 World Cup Final. The pitch was strewn with white ticker tape, and then there was Mario Kempes, long dark curly hair lie a rock star of the day, with socks around his ankles wearing Puma King. Kempes had given hosts Argentina the lead but with eight minutes left Holland equalised through Dick Nanninga. But Kempes restored Argentina’s lead and Daniel Bertoni made sure with a third.

"France's prime minister placed himself as a frontrunner to challenge its unpopular president as he called for the country's Left to reinvent itself or die. In an interview with an influential news weekly, Manuel Valls accused the French left of being 'backward looking' and attached to a 'bygone' past. His comments, published today but already widely trailed, come after President Francois Hollande slapped down Mr Valls' apparent presidential ambitions. Honour: President Francois Hollande awards French Prime Minister Manuel Valls the Grande Croix de l'Ordre National du Merite, or the Great Cross of the National Order of Merit, at the Eysee Palace in Paris yesterday . Barb: President Hollande reportedly told Mr Valls 'One can succeed in life without becoming president.' It was widely interpreted as a dismissal of Mr Valls' apparent ambitions to replace Mr Hollande as Socialist leader . 'One can succeed in life without becoming president,' Mr Hollande was quoted by Bloomberg as saying at a traditional ceremony in which French presidents honour their PMs after six months in office. The barb, which came soon after Mr Hollande rejected Mr Valls' proposal to reform unemployment benefits, was seen in French media as an intensification of the battle at the top level of French politics. The feud comes as rifts plaguing the Socialist party became increasingly apparent, as a hard-Left faction takes on pro-business, neo-liberal figures like both the president and prime minister. Hollande has been unable to stem increasingly strident dissent within his camp despite two cabinet reshuffles. Today Mr Valls called for the establishment of a new 'progressive' party or political alliance. 'We must put a stop to the backward-looking left that has become attached to a bygone and nostalgic past,' Valls said in an interview with news weekly L'Obs. 'If the left does not reinvent itself... it could die,' he warned. 'The left that gives up on reforming, that chooses to defend yesterday's solutions rather than resolve today's problems - that left is picking the wrong fight.' He called on all 'progressive forces' in the country to put their differences aside and gather as one to drag France out of its economic quagmire. 'We must soon create a... federation or one group' of these forces, he said, without detailing who they would be.. Mr Valls in Parliament: In an interview with an nfluential news weekly, he accused the French left of being 'backward looking' and attached to a 'bygone' past and said it had to reinvent itself or die . Both Mr Valls and President Hollande have been sharply criticised by many on the left of the Socialist party for their implementing huge cuts in public spending and giving firms tax breaks in return for pledges to create jobs. Chief among critics who see this as a form of austerity is former economy minister Arnaud Montebourg, whose public dissent got him kicked out of the government in an August emergency reshuffle and replaced by Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker. Former education and culture ministers Benoit Hamon and Aurelie Filippetti followed him out the door but remained MPs. This week a key parliamentary vote on France's 2015 budget was passed with a razor slim majority after they led a group of rebel Socialist lawmakers who abstained. Mr Hamon said the government's current reformist, pro-business stance 'threatens the republic' and would play in the hands of the far-right in the 2017 presidential elections. Time for a comeback? Nicolas Sarkozy at a UMP meeting in Nice, France. The former Frence president is back on the campaign trail as he begins his bid to retake the Elysee Palace in 2017 . Patriotism: Mr Sarkozy  sings the national anthem next to his wife Carla Bruni and officials from his UMP party . France has been unable to stem sky-high unemployment and kickstart growth. The eurozone's second-biggest economy has also admitted it will be unable to get its ballooning budget deficit below the EU ceiling until 2017 - two years later than promised. Mr Hamon warned on RFI radio that the threat was 'not only that (far-right leader) Marine Le Pen would get to the second round of elections without any resistance, but also... that soon, she will lead the country'. The public war of words was another slap in the face for President Hollande, whose perceived inability to hold the ranks together has not helped restore his rock-bottom popularity ratings. In his interview, Mr Valls acknowledged that bad choices were made at the beginning of the administration in 2012. 'We favoured tax (rises) over a drop in public spending,' he said, reiterating his belief in the new direction the government was taking. Mr Valls also warned that if the left failed to reform and yield results, the far-right would be the clear winner, as witnessed already with the National Front party's good results at local and European elections earlier this year.","Manuel Valls accuses French left of being 'backward looking' and 'nostalgic'

"Nottingham scholars splash most on clothes . University of Nottingham scholars are the biggest student fashionistas in the UK, splashing out the most on clothes from all universities in the country, according to a new student spending index. They're also university life's social secretaries, spending most on movies and music. In the run up to freshers week a new spending rank has given freshers an insight into what to expect from their new university, and a fascinating insight into campus life. Wales' top ranked university, Cardiff, is revealed as a student body of gamers, as students there spend the most on video games. King's College London - attended by notable writers Thomas Hardy and John Keats - has the most studious undergraduates, who purchase more academic textbooks than any other students in Britain. There's a clear north-south divide, as those at universities in the midlands and the north are splashing their cash on having fun by buying the most fashion, technology and toys. In contrast, those studying in the capital make more practical purchases, forking out on home improvement products to transform their accommodation, and academic books for their studies. London scholars are also the most active, with Imperial College London and University College London coming within the top three for purchases of sports equipment. Amazon Student, the membership programme for higher education students,  compiled the very first Student Index, revealing the spending patterns of UK students. Data was compiled from sales of items purchased by Amazon Student account holders from March 31 2014 to June 28 2014, and applies to purchases from Amazon.co.uk. An Amazon spokesperson said: 'Starting University can be an expensive time; whether it's the initial outlay on text books or homewares for new halls, there's plenty that students need for their new life. Amazon Student is designed to help students save on their spending, whilst also offering them the very best TV shows, movies and books.'

"If Amelie Mauresmo is doing some backseat driving at Wimbledon then it must have been a ride of Rolls Royce comfort so far. This introduction could hardly have gone better, with Andy Murray easing through the gears and making the last 16, and the sanctuary of the middle weekend, for the loss of just 19 games in three matches. Faced with the in-form opposition of world No 23 Roberto Bautista Agut last night he responded by putting on an exhibition of sublime grass-court tennis to win 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 in just an hour and 35 minutes. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Whitwell and Fraser's Wimbledon day five update . On a roll: Andy Murray put on a fine display of tennis as he marched into week two . Easy: Murray will be planning his assault on the second week as he bids to defend his title . Get in: Murray now plays Kevin Anderson in the last 16 . No wonder the 26-year-old Spaniard, who as a schoolboy was on the books of Valencia, joked beforehand he would rather be taking on the defending champion at football, a passion they share to the point where they have attended La Liga matches together. The excellence of Murray rendered this a mismatch, with the only glitch en route to a fourth-round match against South African giant Kevin Anderson the loss of two service games. Murray has talked about the need for energy conservation ahead of greater challenges, and so far he has only been out there for five hours and 12 minutes. Were it not for the odd scratchy game towards the end, when Bautista Agut began to hit freely, this would have been even briefer than his second-round romp past Blaz Rola. This match coincided with his brother playing (and winning) in the doubles, and Murray feigned indignation afterwards that his family had opted to watch Jamie. ‘I’m obviously the No 2 son, he is the priority. My brother is obviously more important than me, that’s why I’m so competitive,’ he said. Famous face: Television funnyman Ricky Gervais was among Murray's supporters on Centre Court . Watching brief: Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears was on hand to see the British No 1 sail through . Overwhelmed: Bautista Agut had no answer to the reigning champion . Murray then added more seriously: ‘It was a step up today and I thought I responded well. It’s been a good week and now I can rest up and be fresh for Monday. I had enough long matches in the French Open to get me physically ready.’ Murray stressed last week that it would be too early for anyone to blame Mauresmo if anything went wrong in the opening rounds, so by the same token it may be  premature to give her too much credit. Yet beyond doubt is that her charge has been spot-on so far in negotiating his title defence, and her presence appears to have been just as calming as Ivan Lendl’s ever was at this stage. 20 - Leonardo Mayer finally reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam at his 20th attempt. 5 - Jo-Wilfried Tsonga played on each of the first five days. 6.3m - Rafael Nadal has more Twitter followers than any other player. 4 - Four-set defeat for Jonny Marray and John-Patrick Smith in doubles. 21- Novak Djokovic clinched his 21st consecutive Grand Slam 4th round appearance. 27 - Lucie Safarova made the last 16 for the first time at the age of 27. 42 - Lleyton Hewitt broke Andre Agassi’s record for most five-setters played in Grand Slams. 7- Seventeen-year-old Belinda Bencic is the first Swiss woman to reach the third round. It is hard to recall in Murray this week a single moment of the destructive exasperation that can sometimes creep in. Stiffer tests are sure to come, starting with 6ft 8in Anderson who, as Murray observed, is currently playing the best tennis of his career to push his ranking up to No 18. He can cause anyone problems with his huge serve and heavy hitting, but generally the 27-year-old Scot copes well with very tall opponents, as his return is one of the best in the game and he can exploit  their more awkward movement and keep them off balance in the rallies. The South African’s serve will definitely be more potent than that of Bautista Agut, who has battled his way up from obscurity and an almost non-existent junior career through the typical Spanish tennis value of sheer hard work. Here we go: Murray salutes the crowd after giving the British fans more reasons to cheer on Friday . He came in here with some  very decent form, having beaten excellent grass-courters such as Nicolas Mahut and Benjamin Becker en route to the ATP title in Holland last week. That put him on an unlikely seven-match grass-court winning streak for a man who has only played one Wimbledon before, when he reached the second round last year. Murray had walked out at what is a familiar time for him, early evening, his first at this hour during the 2014 campaign due to his defending champion status on Monday and World Cup clashes on Wednesday. Bautista Agut, with whom he trained during the clay-court season in Valencia, started with admirable assurance by claiming the first six points of the match before a Murray ace stemmed the flow. So far, so good: Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo kept tabs on her new charge on Centre Court . No worries: Murray has won nine sets without dropping one after an impressive first week for the Scot . For a Spaniard he hits the ball remarkably flat — partly explaining his recent success on grass — but then Murray switched to softballing him to draw some mistakes before finding an almost perfect blend of defence and attack. He was flying by the time he reached 5-2 in the second set and had three set points, only to waste them and then, by way of self-punishment, drop his serve for the first time in the tournament the next game. He then rattled off the next five games in exhibition style before one other poor service game  interrupted his march to the last 16. Murray looks extremely sharp and his has been the most convincing passage thus far with only Roger Federer, still in the third round, having looked similarly at ease. 30 - Thirtieth seed Marcel Granollers was sent packing by Colombia’s Santiago Giraldo. He must be taking inspiration from his country’s football team.","Andy Murray wasted little time in dispensing with Roberto Bautista Agut on Centre Court .

"From the terrors of the Tower to witch hunts, Jack the Ripper and endless reports of hauntings, the macabre has long had a hold on the popular imagination. Now ghouls, ghosts, vampires - and a group of Whitby Goths - are the subject of a new exhibition at the British Library. Called Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination, it charts the evolution of Gothic literature, as well as delving into its real life inspiration. Nightmare: A Thomas Burke print of Henry Fuseli's The Nightmare made in London circa 1783 . Gothic: A surprisingly colourful visitor to this year's Whitby Goth Weekend photographed by Martin Parr . Original manuscripts by Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker are among the highlights, as is an antique vampire slaying kit from the Royal Armoury and a selection of glamorously Gothic Alexander McQueen frocks. But fascinating though they are, the real stars of the show are a series of photographs taken by award-winning photographer Martin Parr of the biannual Whitby Goth Weekend. The event, which has been taking place twice a year since 1997, is one of the most unusual on the national calendar and sees hordes of Goths descend on the sleepy Yorkshire fishing village to enjoy club nights, a market and, of course, group readings of Dracula. Indeed, the Romanian count, who in the book came ashore in the town, is one of the main reasons behind the choice of location, although Whitby's dramatic ruined abbey also plays a part. The town was also once one of the main sources of jet, a polished black stone that became an enormously popular part of mourning dress during the Victorian period, thanks, in no small part, to Queen Victoria herself. Modern Goths, however, are just a part of a story that began in pre-history, when people attributed unusual events to the machinations of ghosts, witches and even angry ancestors. By the end of the Dark Ages, the British belief in the paranormal was well-established, with those who wanted to avoid a haunting calling on the church to help. Many did so by purchasing reliquaries such as the elaborate gold and turquoise example from the 12th century that appears in the exhibition. More still took action using more formidable tools, with vampire hunting kits - complete with mini stakes and holy water - becoming popular in the 15th century. Party time: One of the Barnsley Goths parties the night away during this year's Whitby Goth Weekend . Bleak: Whitby's bleak ruined abbey is all part of the charm for the Goths who flock to the town twice a year . Macabre: Whitby's Goth Weekends began in 1997 and have proved enormously popular with revellers . Not even the royal family were immune from fears about vampires, with one antique example in the exhibition taken from the Royal Armouries. Despite their fears, however, vampires, ghosts and witches also became popular as literary and theatrical characters, most famously in Shakespeare's Macbeth. The Victorian period, with its love of all things macabre and elaborate mourning rituals, proved a fertile time for writers with a Gothic bent, with the era producing, among others, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Frankenstein and Dorian Grey. So passionate were the Victorians about Gothic literature, the craze even sparked style and decorating trends, with skeleton-adorned clocks and sombre jet jewellery becoming the height of fashion. Creepy: The ghost of Hamlet's father takes on a macabre aspect in Henry Fuseli's Gothic depiction . That's how to do it: Henry Fuseli's Percival Delivering Belisane from the Enchantment of Urma . Spooky: This clock, which dates from around 1840, is coffin-shaped and topped with a creepy skeleton . A legend is born: A first edition of Dracula from 1901 and an early illustration of a female vampire from 1899 . And the penchant for macabre reading material didn't stop with the Victorians, with the success of Bram Stoker's Dracula triggering the Edwardian fascination with vampires, as well as a boost to Whitby's fledgling tourism industry. Indeed, so successful did Dracula prove, the fanged count still exerts a dark hold on the popular imagination today, with True Blood and Dracula Untold the latest manifestations of the fatal allure of the vampire. More modern ghost stories include Kate Mosse's The Mistletoe Bride, while others, such as Susan Hill's 1983 novel, The Woman In Black, have been reworked into films for a modern audience. Haunting: This painting of  Netley Abbey in Hampshire is typical of the Gothic landscapes loved by Victorians . Lethal: A Victorian vampire slaying kit, complete with stakes, a crucifix and a dangerous-looking mallet . Useful kit: The travelling library of Sir Julias Caesar from Strawberry Hill, acquired in 1757 by Horace Walpole . Older, more occult strands of the Gothic imagination also feature, not least in the 1973 British film, The Wicker Man, which plays on the fear of the occult and the far-older Roman horror of the Druids, whom they accused of using dark magic. Musicians too are far from immune to the lure of the supernatural, as a BBC Four spin-off from the exhibition makes plain. Siouxie and the Banshies and The Cure are just two of the bands to take their inspiration from the macabre, aided and abetted by the world of fashion for whom glamorous Goths remain a perennial source of ideas. 'The exhibition features an amazingly wide range of material, from stunningly beautiful medieval artifacts to vinyl records from the early Goth music scene,' explains curator Tim Pye. 'There is truly something for everyone.' Still inspiring: A spooky image created by Dave McKeen for Coraline (left) and for the British Library (right) Enduringly popular: Elsa Lanchester and Boris Karloff in 1939 film, Bride of Frankenstein .

"Health chiefs were today labelled ‘patronising’ for telling parents to confiscate their children’s sweet treats at Halloween. NHS obesity experts insist trick-or-treating youngsters should have their sweets restricted and fruit handed out instead - and even advise that any treats collected should be given back in rations. But the advice issued in Tayside, Scotland, ahead of Halloween events this Friday has resulted in a backlash from parents’ groups and politicians who branded it the ‘nanny state gone mad’. Halloween night: NHS obesity experts insist trick-or-treating youngsters should have their sweets restricted . Siobhan Freegard, founder of parenting website Netmums, said: ‘Halloween may be about scaring people but there’s no need to frighten parents with such silly advice. ‘Most mums and dads wouldn’t let their kids gorge on sweets, but for one fun night of the year, there is no harm done. Kids will burn off calories trick or treating. ‘So while health authorities mean well, talking down to parents and assuming they don’t have any common sense can be very counter-productive.’ The advice was issued by Dr Laura Stewart, team leader of the Paediatric Overweight Service Tayside in Dundee. Dr Stewart also claims the trick-or-treaters should be given a balanced meal before hitting the streets, and parents should be role models by eating in moderation themselves. Opinions: Siobhan Freegard (left), founder of website Netmums, said talking down to parents 'can be very counter-productive', while Conservative MSP Alex Johnstone (right) said the advice was 'insulting to parents' Conservative MSP Alex Johnstone, who represents North East Scotland, said: ‘This really is utterly patronising to the point that it is insulting to parents. ‘People will look at this and come to the conclusion that it is the nanny state gone mad. ‘Halloween is an increasingly important event for children and gives them the opportunity to dress up and have fun, but the sheen will definitely come off the evening if NHS boards are breathing down families’ necks in this fashion.’ And Jack Hart, of the Freedom Association, which campaigns for personal freedom, added: ‘Halloween only comes once a year and it’s a real shame to see local bureaucrats trying to ruin the fun. ‘This over-cautious advice shows little respect for parents’ ability to do what they think is best for their children.’ NHS Tayside refused to respond directly to the criticisms. But Dr Stewart said: ‘We want everyone to have a good time at Halloween but to think about using healthy snacks such as apples or satsumas for trick-or-treats instead of the usual sweets, which can easily turn into unwanted extra weight for children.’","NHS experts say trick-or-treating children should have sweets restricted .

"Sunderland are monitoring the situation of Charlie Austin and could make a move for the Queens Park Rangers striker this summer. The 25-year-old's goalscoring exploits haven’t gone unnoticed. Austin netted 20 times for QPR in his first year at Loftus Road – despite also being out for the entirety of February and March – following a £4million switch from Burnley. Wanted man: QPR striker Charlie Austin is wanted by Sunderland manager Gus Poyet . Goal threat: Austin scored 28 times for QPR to help them get promoted to the Premier League . Not for sale: Harry Redknapp is not likely to oversee the sale of Austin without a fight . Austin, who has two years left on his contract, carried a heavy threat in front of goal for Redknapp and was the only man at the club to score more than six goals. Gus Poyet is looking to offload Danny Graham and there remain doubts over the fitness of Jozy Altidore heading into the new Premier League campaign after he suffered a hamstring problem at the World Cup. Poyet is hopeful that the USA frontman will be firing when they travel to West Brom on August 16, while Austin is a player he has previous links with. During his spell in charge at Brighton, the Uruguayan was a keen admirer of Austin and launched a bid to take the ex-Swindon man to the Amex Stadium. Redknapp is likely to repel any offers given the dearth of attack-minded players currently at his disposal and with talk rife that Loic Remy will be on his way out of the club this month.

"Eden Hazard admitted Belgium did not play well in their 1-0 win over Russia but insisted that the result was all-important to secure qualification for the knock-out rounds of the World Cup. The Chelsea midfielder created the only goal for 19-year-old striker Divock Origi two minutes from time to settle a tight contest against Fabio Capello's side. Hazard, who came alive during the final 10 minutes and threatened several times before the goal, said: 'It was a difficult match but we are very happy with the result and the victory today means we have already qualified and still have one match to go in the group.

'We will now aim for three wins in this group campaign.

He said: 'We were fresher, we were better and that made the difference - maybe due to our very good fitness preparations. 'We want to be number one in the group but if there are yellow cards or for reasons of freshness I may make a decision.' Disappointing display: Hazard's Chelsea team-mate Romelu Lukaku offered little before he was subbed off . Origi had come on for Romelu Lukaku after 55 minutes and the Chelsea striker trooped off the field looking hugely disappointed. Wilmots added: 'If he has to go off after 55 minutes he's not happy of course - that's natural. It's not a problem, it's normal and it happened to me as well. 'I understand his reaction completely and I will analyse things with him, but I need all my players and the truth of today is not always the truth of tomorrow.'

Jumping for joy: Belgium fans celebrate in the FIFA Fan Fest area on Copacabana beach as Origi scores . Capello's Russia side need to beat Algeria and hope Belgium defeat South Korea to have any chance of progressing, and the Italian insisted his players had done well. He said: 'Frankly I am very happy with the performance the team and I thought the result was unfair. 'The truth of the matter is we had chances to win it but we lost. Both teams gave it their all and unfortunately it was Belgium that was able to make it.

"Following the death of seven-year-old stallion Araldo after this year's Melbourne Cup - who had to be put down when he broke his leg after being spooked by a flag-waving crowd member - The Victoria Racing Club (VRC) have banned flags from horse areas. Temporary changes have also been made to the route used to take horses back to the Mounting Yard following the tragic event which lead to one of two horse deaths on Tuesday. Admire Rakti, the pre-race favourite, also died shortly after the prestigious race, with a preliminary autopsy pointing to to acute heart failure and an irregular heart rhythm as the cause of death. VRC confirmed the changes to Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday evening, citing the safety and wellbeing of horses, participants, employees and other event patrons as the key reasons. Scroll down for video . Seven-year-old stallion Araldo (left) ridden by Dwayne Dunn is pictured tangled in the fence after being spooked by an Australian flag . The ban on flags will be in place for the remaining two days of the spring racing carnival, but it has not been confirmed whether these measures will be implemented permanently. Mark Schneider, pictured, was waving the flag and told Seven News he was 'shattered' and 'regretted' the events that unfolded on Tuesday after the Melbourne Cup race . Julian Sullivan, VRC Acting Chief Executive, said the amendments had been implemented in direct response to Araldo sustaining a broken pastern when returning to the Mounting Yard on Tuesday. 'While it is important not to respond in a knee-jerk manner, these interim arrangements will be implemented until procedures are reviewed after the Melbourne Cup Carnival,' Mr Sullivan said. Horses will also be led along a different path after the race, a decision which was made in conjunction with Racing Victoria Chairman of Stewards Terry Bailey. 'Traditionally horses wait for the winner to lead them down the race, but will now enter the Mounting Yard in the order they return,' Mr Sullivan said. 'The larger crowds that gather for the Group 1 races will still have the opportunity to see the horses return to scale along the track.' On Wednesday Seven News spoke to Michael Schneider, who along with his partner was waving the flag which spooked Araldo. He told the program he proudly flies the flag in that area every year and deeply regretted the whole incident. 'As owners ourselves we are shattered at the events of yesterday ... regretting what unfolded and are deeply shaken,' Mr Schneider said. A woman named Lauren who was standing next to him when the events unfolded filmed an exchange between Mr Schneider and another racegoer. The man accused Mr Schneider of finding it funny when Araldo was injured, and Lauren added: 'I don't think he really cared until he found out that the horse was injured.' Earlier on Wednesday pictures emerged showing Araldo, which ran seventh, clearly distressed at the site of a large flag being waved by a member of the public - who then shattered its leg after freaking out and kicking a fence on the way back to the mounting yard. Anthony Feroce, the racing manager of Araldo's stables, told the Herald Sun Melbourne Cup organisers should review crowd control measures after the freak incident, saying: 'It's not like car racing.' The horse, which ran seventh, is clearly distressed at the site of a large flag being waved by a member of the crowd - and shattered its leg after freaking out and kicking a fence on the way back to the mounting yard . The horse was later put down due to the injury suffered, during Melbourne Cup Day at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne on Tuesday . The death of Araldo and pre-race favour Admire Rakti overshadowed victory for the German-trained Protectionist, who romped away with the biggest winning margin in nearly two decades, and also reignited a bitter debate about the ethical treatment of racing horses. Dr Stewart said an autopsy was conducted for Admire Rakti on Tuesday night at the University of Melbourne and initial results point to acute heart failure and an irregular heart rhythm. A full post mortem with microscopic and toxicology studies will take 10 days or more, he said. 'It's seen in racehorses and human athletes as well - in the large mass of the muscle of the heart, the electrical current has to get through in a coordinated way, and at high heart rates sometimes that can become short circuited,' Dr Stewart said. Admire Rakti, the pre-race favourite, finished last in the Melbourne Cup and almost walked across the line . The heartbreaking moment that Melbourne Cup pre-race favourite Admire Rakti collapses and dies in the stall after the race . Racing Victoria head of veterinary services and equine welfare Dr Brian Stewart (left) and chairman of stewards Terry Bailey arrive at a press conferenceon Wednesday. Mr Bailey called Dr Stewart at 10pm the night before the Melbourne Cup to ask him to vet Admire Rakti . 'It happens more or less spontaneously with no warning.' He initially said the horse suffered from 'sudden death syndrome', which occurs in just 0.007 per cent of racehorses. The reason for Araldo’s demise was immediately clear. Speaking shortly afterwards, his trainer Mike Moroney said that the stallion had become distressed by a big flag and run off. 'They run the Melbourne Cup for 154 years and nothing like that has happened,' he said. Anthony Feroce, racing manager at Mike Moroney's Ballymore stables, said the horse's death was a 'freakish accident', but he anticipated the Victoria Racing Club would review how close punters are allowed to get to Cup horses following the race. 'I think the Victoria Racing Club does a magnificent job, but possibly they could look at flags that close to where the horses go,' Mr Feroce said. 'Someone had a big flag and was waving it and right at the time when our horse went passed it and they're animals, they get spooked quite easily.' Mr Feroce added that it was 'not fair' that racing was being portrayed as a cruel industry following the deaths of the two horses. 'All care is taken for their wellbeing and their welfare and I assure you, you've just got to talk to everybody involved and see how much love they have for the animals,' he said. 'Now and then we do have unfortunate accidents that happen but that's no different to any other sport.' The deaths of the two horses prompted an outpouring of comment online and reaction from animal charities who insist that racing is a cruel sport.

Inconsolable: Ghana were denied their first World Cup semi-final appearance with a 4-2 loss vs Uruguay . GERMAN EFFICIENCY . Unsurprisingly Germany are the kings when it comes to a penalty shootout - missing only one of their 18 attempts from the spot. The three-time World Cup champions have a perfect record of played four, won four and were involved in the very first shootout at the 1982 World Cup against France. History: Germany have never lost a penalty shootout winning the first one vs France in the 1982 World Cup . A controversial semi-final against the French, when Germany goalkeeper Harald Schumacher wiped out Patrick Battiston - resulting in the midfielder being knocked out unconscious and losing three teeth, they held their nerve to win 5-4 in Seville.

"Details of the British ebola screening programme were revealed yesterday – but critics immediately dismissed it as not going far enough. While the US has announced it will test passengers with a thermal gun, the British response amounts to little more than a few questions. It will be introduced at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar terminals for passengers travelling from the affected West African regions. The tests will involve assessing passengers’ recent travel history and who they have been in contact with, as well as a possible medical assessment. Passengers from Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea will be identified by information passed from airlines and diverted into a separate queue at customs. Scroll down for video . Taking aim: A health worker uses a thermal scanner to test the temperature of a passenger at a Moroccan airport yesterday . In a holding area, they will be asked how they are feeling, whether they have been in contact with ebola victims and if they have touched bush meat. If the medical staff are concerned, they will start a full assessment. But they will stop short of screening the temperatures of passengers using thermal guns, a procedure which will be adopted in the US this weekend. Thermal screening, which was first used during the Chinese SARS outbreak in 2002, picks out passengers who have an elevated temperature using an infrared temperature gun. While the US has announced it will test passengers with a thermal gun, the British response amounts to little more than a few questions . A team of scientists at Northeastern University in Boston have used air travel information to predict where the deadly Ebola virus could reach in the next three weeks . In the affected countries, 36,000 people have been tested and 77 have been stopped from boarding flights since health tests were introduced two months ago. They were identified after temperature checks found they had a fever. Ultimately none of those stopped was diagnosed as having ebola. In many cases they were suffering from malaria, a disease rife in the region. Experts have warned that screening will not necessarily pick up ebola sufferers because the virus has an incubation period of up to 21 days before symptoms emerge. Academics argue that the easiest and most efficient way of stopping the spread of highly infectious diseases is to screen people before they fly out of the affected area. The Government has so far announced few specific details about how it will implement the new screening checks at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras station. Professor David Mabey from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said questionnaires were a waste of time and that passengers would lie. Academics argue that the easiest and most efficient way of stopping the spread of highly infectious diseases is to screen people before they fly out of the affected area . He added: ‘If last week your aunt died of ebola but you feel fine, are you going to be honest when you get to the airport and risk being detained and missing your holiday?’ Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said it was prudent to carry out checks on passengers entering the UK. ‘Targeted screening would help and if it discovers just one case it would make a huge difference,’ he said. ‘We don’t want to be in the position where they are in Spain, where one case has caused so much distress.’ Writing for the The New York Times, Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy a the University of Minnesota, said those experts are loathed to discuss their concerns in public, for fear of whipping up hysteria. Discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak, he said: 'The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private: that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air.' But the chair of the UK's Health Protection Agency, Professor David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene of Tropical Medicine, said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate. He said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the ebola virus will change over time. Pointing to the example of the H1N1 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009, Dr Osterholm said: 'If certain mutations occurred, it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola.' But Professor Heymann, told MailOnline: 'No one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus. 'I would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus. 'The virus's epidemiology is consistent with transmission via bodily secretions and excretions, which is exactly the same as other past epidemics. Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, sounded a note of caution. He said: ‘Temperature screening proved very effective at controlling the SARS outbreak, because you can spot those people who have a fever when they are at their most infectious. ‘With ebola, in a similar way, anyone who is infectious should be picked up. But in the incubation period of up to 21 days, when there are no symptoms and it is not infectious, it would not work and someone could slip through. My worry is that screening could engender a false sense of security.’","Downing Street orders screening at Heathrow and Gatwick, and Eurostar .

"So it is official: Luis Suarez has gone the way of Michael Owen and Fernando Torres, to seek a fresh challenge after lighting up the Barclays Premier League in Liverpool red. During my 16 years at Liverpool Suarez, Owen and Torres were the three best strikers I played alongside (Robbie Fowler was not at his peak when I was making my way in the first team), but Suarez was top of that all-star list. Luis used to do things on the pitch that were so audacious, you could only laugh in amazement. But now here’s the question: will he get the same kind of adulation in Camp Nou as he did at Anfield? Hero worship: Luis Suarez was idolised by Liverpool fans during his time at Anfield . Spanish fly: Liverpool striker has completed a £75million move to Barcelona . Unloved: Fernando Torres and Michael Owen (R) never found the same love after leaving Liverpool . Or will he end up like Owen and Torres, searching for affection and struggling to replicate the devastating goals-per-game ratio they had in their Merseyside pomp? There was a reason Owen and Torres never recreated what they had done for Liverpool. Our team was built around them and, in Steven Gerrard, they had someone to supply them with killer balls; their pace was perfect for Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benitez, who liked to destroy teams on the counter-attack. Suarez was afforded a similar indulgence. Don’t forget Brendan Rodgers jettisoned Andy Carroll as soon as he arrived in 2012 and constructed a side around his No 7. Suarez was good for Rodgers with the goals he scored but, equally, Rodgers was good for Suarez and gave him licence to roam. Clearly, Luis can be a star for Barcelona. He has the ability to play with any player and thrive for any club but it is not a given, by any means, that he will simply turn up in Catalonia and replicate what he was doing for Liverpool. For all that we admire Barcelona, for all that we have marvelled at how tiki-taka has changed our perceptions of how the game should be played, they are not an easy team to play for — you don’t just pull on that distinctive jersey and join in the fun, particularly if you are a striker. Centre of attention: Brendan Rodgers built his Liverpool team around the 27-year-old . Numero Uno: Luis Suarez is unlikley to displace Lionel Messi as the main man at Barcelona . Look at Thierry Henry. He is arguably the Premier League’s greatest player, certainly the best I played against, but he never showed the same wow factor after he left Arsenal. Yes, he won seven trophies, including the Champions League, but he had a strict role to play on the left wing. Strikers who are brought into Barcelona don’t get the option of operating through the middle because that is the domain of Lionel Messi. He is the king, the man around whom this particular team is built and others have to tailor their game accordingly. Think about it: Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Neymar, Alexis Sanchez — all brilliant attackers, all undisputed match-winners, but none of them flourished alongside Messi. Even David Villa, for all his brilliance and the trophies he won, became frustrated towards the end of his time at Barcelona playing second fiddle to Messi. Second fiddle: Thierry Henry and Zlatan Ibrahimovic struggled under Messi's shadow at the Nou Camp . Boy from Brazil: Neymar . New in town: Luis Suarez . Phenomenon: Lionel Messi . The system is what matters and you can see that from the decision to let Cesc Fabregas, who looked to be Xavi’s natural heir, join Chelsea. So where will Luis fit in? A front three of Suarez, Messi and Neymar sounds like it has come straight from the computer game Football Manager but it will be fascinating to see how Luis Enrique, the new man in charge at Camp Nou, juggles the demands when Luis is available. Messi’s position is not up for debate and Neymar plays from the left, as Suarez would like to. Does that mean he goes out on the right? Luis played out wide for Liverpool on occasions, and did the job well, but he knew he wouldn’t do it every week and also had the freedom to roam. Is playing in a specified position something Suarez will accept and adapt to or is something that will take the edge off his spontaneous, impulsive brilliance? Wrong city? The Liverpool may have been better off moving to Real Madrid . I thought a move to Real Madrid would have been more natural for him. Yes, Ronaldo is the star but Luis is a better player than Karim Benzema and he would have played in his rightful position — straight down the middle. Liverpool will desperately miss him, there can be no disputing that, but the time was right for him to leave and the club have got the best cash deal they could, as was the case when Torres headed to Chelsea in January 2011. What they must make sure does not happen is falling into the trap Tottenham did 12 months ago of spending a giant windfall on players about whom nobody is sure where they play or what they do. They have to use this finance to build on the foundations Suarez helped lay last season.","Luis Suarez has completed a £75m transfer from Liverpool to Barcelona .

"Joe Biden added a page to his lengthy book of gaffes on Thursday night, mocking the plight of overlooked vice presidents everywhere by asking a Harvard University audience, 'Isn't it a b**ch?' During a speaking appearance at Harvard's Institute of Politics, senior Sietse Goffard rose to ask a question and first noted that 'I’m the vice president of the student body here.' 'Isn't it a b**ch,' Biden quipped. 'I mean – excuse me – the vice president thing?' Amid laughter, he quickly backpedaled from the latest in his long string of public blunders. Scroll down for video . 'Isn't that a b**ch,' Biden ask Harvard University's student body vice-president. 'I mean – excuse me – the vice president thing?'

That was a joke,' Biden said of his colorful take on always being second. Goffard told him: 'I hope you love your job.' 'I do actually,' Biden responded. 'I love that guy I work with.' Biden, a rumored 2016 presidential candidate, is a walking gaffe top-ten list known for his mastery of the inappropriate and flat-out wrong. During this summer's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, he told Africa's heads of state that their continent was actually a country. ​'There's no reason the nation of Africa cannot and should not join the ranks of the world's most prosperous nations in the near term,' he said. And Thursday night wasn't the public's first glimpse of his more colorful vocabulary. Biden famously told President Barack Obama during a White House ceremony that his Affordable Care Act law was 'a big f***ing deal' – a comment that his lapel mic caught and broadcast nationwide. Four years ago he noted in a diplomatic face-palm moment how Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen's mother had 'lived in Long Island for ten years or so' before her death. 'God rest her soul,' Biden said somberly, before realizing that 'wait – your mom’s still ... your mom’s still alive. Your dad passed. God bless her soul.' In 2012 he made the sign of the cross while on stage to address a group of more than 1,600 conservative rabbis in Atlanta. Reporters guffawed later that year when he tried to capture the spirit of President Theodore Roosevelt's famous 'Speak softly' philosophy, by noting that 'the president has a big stick. I promise you.' Biden spoke to a capacity crowd at left-leaning Harvard on Thursday night, answering questions at the Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Mass. It brought back memories of a 2008 photo-op outside Biden's home where he told journalists that he had just returned from 'a successful dump,' which turned out to be a trip to a nearby landfill. Two months later during an Ohio campaign speech, Biden criticized then-GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain for what he called a 'last-minute economic plan' that did 'nothing to tackle the number-one job facing the middle class.' 'It happens to be, as Barack says, a three-letter word: jobs. J-O-B-S, jobs.' Several of Biden's most cringe-worthy moments have riled conservatives who say their own political stars would have been pilloried in print and on television if they had made similar comments. 'You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent,' he told an Indian-American man in 2006, with a C-SPAN camera rolling. 'I'm not joking.'","Obama's VP spoke to Harvard political student group at the Kennedy School of Government .

"The clocks will go back in the early hours of tomorrow morning, officially marking the end of British summertime . It's that time of year again when the cold, winter nights draw in and we say goodbye to British summertime. The UK will return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) when the clocks turn back an hour at 2am tomorrow morning - giving us an extra hour in bed. It means tomorrow will be a 25-hour day with the sun rising and setting an hour earlier than today, meaning the mornings will be lighter. During British Summer Time (BST) the time advances an hour to allow for extra daylight in the evenings. The idea was first proposed by George Vernon Hudson, an English-born insect specialist and astronomer, in 1895. As a shift worker he valued the daylight after-hours for collecting insects and proposed a two-hour daylight saving shift, presenting it in a paper to the Wellington Philosophical society. But his ideas were never carried through and it was builder William Willett who put forward another proposal and in 1907 published a pamphlet called The Waste of Daylight. It outlined how during the summer, the mornings were being 'wasted' by people who were still asleep for most of it and how moving the clocks would encourage people out of bed. The notion was picked up by MPs who introduced it as a bill in the House of Commons, but it did not become a law - and Willett fought for the scheme until he died in 1915. A year after his death Germany introduced the system as a way to conserve coal during war time -and Britain quickly followed suit in May 1916. However the decision was not without controversy - farmers and those working in the entertainment industry opposed it. While it caused problems for those with clocks which did not have the facility to go backwards without breaking the  mechanism, instead owners had to set their watches 11 hours forward. Despite that, the system has remained in place ever since, apart from an experimental three years between 1968 and 1971 and during the Second World War. Now it has been claimed that the clocks going back over winter adds £24 to the typical household's yearly energy bill as people switch their lights on sooner. Throughout the winter months it increases the nation's winter electricity bills to £630million, a study by B&Q claims. During British Summer Time (BST) the clock goes forward an hour to allow for extra daylight in the evenings . The calculation is based on the assumption that the average household uses 30 light bulbs with a mixture of traditional incandescent bulbs, energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs, halogen lights and a few LED lights. The retailer says that switching entirely to LED light's would see winter lighting bills drop to just £2.47. Matt Sexton, from B&Q, told the Daily Telegraph: 'We can't change the fact that the clocks go back, we can't change the fact that we'll be leaving our lights on for longer, but we can change a light bulb. 'Switching to LED light bulbs is an easy way of cutting down our energy bills with minimal effort.' Meanwhile Scotland could have its own time zone under plans to move the UK to Central European Time. Builder William Willett put forward the idea of moving the clocks in 1907 after becoming frustrated that people were sleeping through the daylight in the mornings . The campaign to shift the UK forward an hour, aligning the nation with most of Europe, is supported by a wide range of MPs, who claim the change would save lives on the road thanks to extra sunlight. Scotland has been opposed to the change in the past, but campaigners say Westminster could devolve powers allowing Scots to set their own time. The clocks are due to go forward again on the last Sunday in March 2015.","The nation returns to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) at 2am tomorrow .

"England began this summer wanting pace, bounce and carry in their Test pitches but have instead been confronted with surfaces more akin to Colombo and Kolkata than Lord’s, Headingley and Trent Bridge. The result on Wednesday was that India felt very much at home on the first day of a pivotal series for Alastair Cook. Certainly there was no home advantage in Nottingham for England on a low, slow batting paradise of a pitch that was prepared more to ensure that the first Investec Test will last into the weekend rather than produce compelling cricket. Duncan Fletcher never gives much away but the India coach would have been inwardly grinning like a Cheshire cat behind his inscrutable façade at the warm hospitality offered to his side here by his old employers at the ECB. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Anderson on England's first day performance in India test . Number one: India opener Murali Vijay celebrates his century having dominated day one at Trent Bridge . Over the top: Vijay hits a six straight over the bowler's head as Matt Prior watches on in Nottingham . Poised: Vijay brought up his hundred in the afternoon session after blowing England away in the morning . Captain's approval: India skipper MS Dhoni embraces Vijay (facing) after bringing up his hundred . Australians did not stop whingeing last year at pitches they considered were made for Graeme Swann but clearly groundsmen are either unwilling or unable to provide the sort of life that would have offered hope to England here. Murali Vijay averages 18 outside of India but here he was able to record his first Test century away from his home country even though England did pretty much all they could to keep their opponents within reach. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad have fabulous records at Trent Bridge but with the ball refusing to swing other than for an all too brief spell of reverse after lunch this was every bit as tough for them as Sri Lanka’s famous victory in Leeds. England, to be fair, had a pretty good day but still ended it with India on 259 for four and if this is the way it will be for a five-Test series that will be crammed into just 42 days then there will be some exhausted bowlers by the end of it. Breakthrough: On a tough day for England's pace attack James Anderson took wickets in quick succession . Short stuff: Ajinkya Rahane evades a bouncer from Anderson before falling to a similar ball from Liam Plunkett . Put down: Alastair Cook puts down a chance at silly point from Rahane . That is if any bowlers are still standing by then. The first casualty of a punishing itinerary came on the very first day when Ben Stokes, returning to the England side, appeared to suffer a side injury pushing himself through the dirt. Stokes will not be the last if the Test venues continue to put the bottom line before the need to produce more of an even contest between bat and ball, let alone the wishes of a national side who ultimately pay domestic cricket’s bills. New drainage systems and the heavy roller are being blamed for lifeless English pitches but far more pertinent is the ECB’s prohibitive bidding system for Tests that sees counties paying huge fees to stage matches. Tests have to last five days for any county to make a profit from big matches. Broad was seen in animated conversation with Trent Bridge groundsman Steve Birks on Tuesday, apparently questioning the look of the pitch, and his worst fears were realised by this lifeless, soul-destroying 22 yards of turf. Taking the strain: There were fears Ben Stokes had succumbed to a side injury on day one . Comeback: Stokes returned to the attack late in the day but flat wickets it could take a toll on England's quicks . There must be some guilt at Trent Bridge because Birks took the almost unprecedented step of admitting he had got things wrong in his preparation. ‘We wanted to produce a pitch with pace, bounce and carry but unfortunately it hasn’t happened,’ said Birks on day one. ‘There’s quite a lot of moisture underneath but it’s a hard surface on top which is why it’s lacking pace. ‘Our only instruction is to produce a good cricket wicket and, with hindsight, we may have left a bit more grass on it but this is the first day of a five-day Test and we hope it might quicken up a bit.’ England, not to mention spectators seeking value for money, will hope he is right. ‘We are amazing hosts,’ said Anderson wryly. ‘And we are as frustrated as everyone watching. As bowlers we want our nicks to carry and for there to be a more even contest between bat and ball but I thought our attitude was fantastic. We could have moaned and groaned but we just got on with it. The pitch is what it is and we can’t do anything about it.’ Prize wicket: Stuart Broad celebrates his dismissal of India danger man Virat Kohli for a solitary run . VIDEO Vijay puts India in control . At lunch, after India had moved serenely to 106 for one, England already seemed to be staring down the barrel but they pulled things back after the interval in an hour where India scored just 18 runs and lost two wickets. Anderson, who had taken his 50th Test wicket at Trent Bridge when Shikhar Dhawan fell to a brilliant Matt Prior catch, suddenly got the ball to reverse and Cook backed him up with imaginative field placings. Cheteshwar Pujara was equally well caught by Ian Bell after Cook had placed him at silly mid on while Bell’s safe hands were equally to the fore when Virat Kohli played at a Broad delivery he could have left alone and edged to slip. After that normal service was pretty much resumed with England’s only other success coming when Ajinkya Rahane toe-ended an attempted pull off Liam Plunkett to Cook at silly point before India’s captain MS Dhoni joined Vijay in an unbroken partnership of 81 that saw India on top at the close. Dangerous: No 3 Chesteshwar Pujara was threatening a big score before he was dismissed for 38 . Top take: It took an excellent catch from Ian Bell (centre) off the bowling of Anderson (right) to remove Pujara . Vijay became watchful, notably while spending 48 balls in the 90s, while Dhoni was much more forthright, his strong wrists to the fore in his punchy strokes with minimal backlift. England need to separate the pair quickly on Thursday. No real criticism could be aimed at the bowlers who, on the whole, let Cook down at Headingley, with Broad in particular looking much more like his old self while conceding only 26 runs from his 19 overs. Cook is under considerable scrutiny so it should be said that tactically he was bright and imaginative, with his only flaw being his reluctance to plug the third man gap where more than 30 per cent of India’s runs were scored. He can only hope that an expected change in the weather on day two might alter conditions for the bowlers. Otherwise England could be in trouble.","India finished with 259 for 4 off 90 overs tough over for England on day one .

Following the arrest, he was controversial offered a deal with an underwear company. The 22-year-old landed the contract in a bid to atone for his crime, revealing he will donate $15,000 of the brand's apparel to children in need. 'There is no excuse for my mistake last week, and I take full responsibility for my actions,' Randle said, via ESPNDallas.com. 'I let down my coaches, teammates, and family. 'My agent and I have spent a lot of time looking for ways I can turn my situation into a learning experience for young people.

"The brown and black plaid jacket is expected to take a staggering $73,000 at auction . A jacket worn by Leonardo DiCaprio in the famous 'king of the world' scene in blockbuster Titanic has emerged for sale with a staggering $70,000 price tag. DiCaprio, who played struggling artist Jack Dawson in the 1997 hit film, was wearing the brown and black plaid jacket in the unforgettable scene where he is stood at the bow of the legendary ocean liner. As the doomed ship heads out into the Atlantic Ocean on its ill-fated voyage, DiCaprio's character jumps up onto the railings and with open arms declares: 'I'm the king of the world!' The scene is among the most memorable of the film and the 'king of the world' line has been voted among the top 100 film quotes of all time. DiCaprio recreates the pose later in the film when he woos Kate Winslet's well-to-do socialite character Rose DeWitt Bukater. Rather than being made specially for the film, costume designer Deborah Lynne Scott hand-picked the vintage jacket from costume rental company Repeat Performance. After filming was over the jacket was returned to the company, which has now decided to sell it 17 years after the film's release. Experts have described the coat as the 'Holy Grail of film collecting'. They expect it to fetch $70,000 when it goes under the hammer at Californian auction house Profiles in History in October. Brian Chanes, an expert from Profiles in History, said: 'Leonardo's character Jack is wearing this jacket when he first meets Rose but the scene in which it is most prominent in is the famous 'king of the world' scene. 'It's a signature part of the film before the boat starts sinking in a bit that leads up to Jack and Rose falling in love. 'The scene was so iconic it was used in promotional materials. It's an incredibly memorable line and it's been voted in the top 100 movie quotes of all time. 'This coat is the only one in the world - the costume designer for Titanic hand-picked it from a vintage rental shop because she thought it personified Leonardo's character Jack. DiCaprio, who played struggling artist Jack Dawson in the 1997 film, was wearing the brown and black plaid jacket in the unforgettable scene where he stands at the bow of the ship and shouts: 'I'm the king of the world' Jack Dawson - wearing a different jacket - again stands at the bow later in the film when he meets Kate Winslet's well-to-do socialite character Rose DeWitt Bukater . 'It has been consigned by the rental house and we have all the documentation to back it up. 'When it comes to collecting the wardrobes of modern actors, Leonardo DiCaprio is in a league of his own - collectors clamor for material from Leo. 'Titanic is a modern classic and this is one of the top pieces you could ever hope to obtain. This coat is like the Holy Grail of modern film collecting.' The auction will take place on October 17.

"Of all the unlikely success stories at this World Cup, it would be hard to top that of emerging US star Graham Zusi. Five years ago, he was living with the parents of team-mate Matt Besler to save money as he tried to get MLS club Sporting Kansas City to turn a six-month contract into something more permanent. Not only is he still with Kansas in 2014 and their star player, Zusi has also gone on to become Jurgen Klinsmann's secret weapon at this World Cup. VIDEO Scroll down for We've still got a chance to win it! Obama supports U.S.A . All American hero: Graham Zusi has emerged as one of the stars of the USA team . Having started the tournament on the bench, he's set up the two goals that have got the US into the knockout stages and created unprecedented soccer-fever back  home. Naturally, Klinsmann is delighted with midfielder, recognisable for flowing dark locks and the God-like nickname “Zeus”: . 'He's in the inner circle now,' said the German manager. 'He has stepped  it up, gained confidence and that's great to see.' West Ham may also wonder why he didn't stand out when he trained with them in January 2013, returning to America without a contract offer at Upton Park. If we didn't know too much about him before the World Cup, you can be sure Belgium manager Marc Wilmots has done his research on 26-year-old Zusi, and particularly his delivery at set-pieces, before Tuesday night's round of 16 tie in Salvador. Zusi's story is typical of the new generation of American players taking the game to a new audience. Making a name for himself: Zusi has come a long way in the last few years . Part of the team: Zusi has proved to be a key member of the USA side along with more well known players like Michael Bradley, Clint Dempsey and Jermaine Jones . Up against the best: Zusi tackles Cristiano Ronaldo during their group game . No soccer player Stateside is born with a silver spoon. Starting salaries even at MLS level can be as low as $34,000-a-year (£20,000) and you have to show hunger and desire to make it. Zusi was only ranked 23rd in the draft system used by American sport when he was signed by Kansas in 2009. He couldn't afford his own apartment in the city so slept on an airbed in someone else's, and then moved in with Besler and his family. In a nice twist, Besler is also in Klinsmann's  World Cup squad in Brazil. Helping hand: Zusi lived with Matt Besler's parents when he was starting out and could not afford a place of his own . In MLS,  Zusi proved to be a slow burner. 2012 was his breakthrough year, top of the assist charts with 15, and a 45-yard free-kick proving a Youtube sensation, that includes the amusing commentary: “Pizza Hut Park has become the field of dreams for Graham Zusi”. When a move to England didn't work out early in 2013, Zusi returned home and got a new four-year contract with Kansas. League star: Zusi is one of the best players playing for Sporting Kansas City in MLS . The early years: Zusi in his early years for Sporting Kansas City in 2009 . Working his way up: Zusi was playing for Maryland at the ACC Tournament back in 2006 . Klinsmann took note. Zusi became an important player in qualification and his goal against Panama also helped Mexico qualify for the finals, making him a hero there too. In Brazil, the Zusi success story has really taken off. A late substitute in the first US game against Ghana,  it was his brilliant outswinging corner that set up John Brooks to head the winner, leaving the scorer in disbelief. Zusi was put in the starting line-up with Jozy Altidore injured, and he set up Clint Dempsey's goal against Portugal with another important cross. It proved the goal that ultimately took the US into the knockout stages. Despite Belgium's galaxy of stars, there is a growing sense of belief in the US team that they can reach the quarter-finals for only the second time. Zusi and his colleagues are threatening to become as popular as NBA or NFL stars. Having his old buddy Besler beside him has made it all the more special for the 26-year-old, who has scored and made goals consistently for the past two seasons. 'After all we've been through together,' he said. 'I can't imagine sharing this experience with anyone else.'","Graham Zusi was staying with Matt Besler's parents to save money five years ago .

Watching from the Royal Box was the relatively new chief executive of the LTA, Canadian Michael Downey. He . got the job partly due to the progress being made in the sport in his . native land that has manifested itself this week in the success of . Bouchard and Milos Raonic. It . is possible the Champions’ Dinner might have to be draped in the Maple . Leaf on Sunday night if Raonic blasts his way through as well, but . Bouchard has beaten him to being the first Canadian into a Grand Slam . singles final. One of . the remarkable aspects about her is the matter-of-fact attitude towards . what she has achieved. Others might have been surprised by it, but she . is not. Incident: A spectator was taken from the court unwell during the first-set tie-break . Hold up: Play was held up for four minutes with the score at 3-2 in the first-set tie-break . She handles questions about her ambitions - or her supposed admiration for Justin Bieber - with an aplomb beyond her years. ‘It’s . not like a surprise to me. I expect good results like this,’ she said. ‘So for me, I was like, OK, good. It’s a step in the right direction. I . get to play in the final. 'I . still have another match, so it’s not a full celebration yet. I get to . make Canadian history again. It’s always exciting and special when I can . make history. My job is not done.’ In . tennis, many players get distracted if their opponent is carrying an . injury but Bouchard retained the same laser focus throughout. ‘I’m able to not worry about the distractions, especially when it’s out of my control,’ she said. Picture: Centre Court was bathed in sunshine on women's semi-finals day at Wimbledon . ‘Someone . in the crowd not feeling well is definitely out of my control. It happens. I really don’t let it get to me or affect me. I love being . challenged and I love working hard to try to overcome something. I see . it as an opportunity.’ Bouchard . sees it as a compliment to be compared to Sharapova, but only in terms . of the Russian being a five-times major winner. That would have seemed . unthinkable three years ago when her final opponent, Petra Kvitova, won . the title while Bouchard was reaching the quarter-finals of the junior . event. The Canadian’s . ability to take the ball early troubles most opponents, and there was a . bonus for her in that Halep, the recent French Open finalist, struggled . with her serve after the tumble. Yet . it was fairly even in the first set with breaks exchanged until the . tiebreak, when the elderly fan got into difficulties. Just after that . Bouchard fell 2-4 behind before reeling off the next four points and . then clinching it 7-5. The . Romanian subsequently lost a bit of heart and the only blot on . Bouchard’s performance was that it took six match points from 5-1 up . before she landed an unplayable first serve that put her through to the . final. Her presence . there will add to the growing sentiment across the men’s and women’s . games that the plates of both top 10s are shifting.","The Canadian sealed her place in the final in straight sets against Halep .

"England exit Brazil with a solitary point and two goals to show for all the blood, sweat and millions of pounds spent on this World Cup adventure. It has been a sorry return. They finish anchored somewhat miserably to the bottom of Group D, but will be back in competitive action in the autumn for the Euro 2016 qualifiers. There are big decisions ahead for Roy Hodgson about the direction of this team and maybe even one or two glimmers of encouragement to be found, somewhere within his 'realm of despair'. PHIL JONES: An athletic performance made Hodgson’s odd experiment with Milner at right back all the more puzzling. Thought it must be said that any full-back appears more solid with Milner ahead in midfield. Hodgson moved Milner to help Luke Shaw midway through the first-half. Jones is a talented player, has physical presence which is useful at set-pieces and still only 22. It is time for him to find a position. Right-back is certainly an option, where he gets up and down the wing, attacks well, but he needs to gain experience there. He can be reckless and his positional play sometimes lacking. He was almost caught out by a long ball on half-time. IN. Staying put: Phil Jones has don enough to suggest he deserves to keep his place in the squad . CHRIS SMALLING: Made a terribly nervous start. His distribution was poor, especially on his left side, and he seemed a little at sea between Gary Cahill and Shaw. He settled down as it went on but plays with such a casual air that sloppiness spreads through the team, a dangerous prospect in the heart of defence. There were better signs later in the game, proof he is strong in the air, mobile and quick across the ground, be it to intercept or to recover. OUT. LUKE SHAW: The . only real signs of his youth are in a positional sense. Sometimes he . was a little too eager to fly past his winger. He allowed situations to . develop around him without organising team-mates around to provide . cover, and the Costa Ricans were keen to come and play on his wing in . the first half. These things he will learn. Otherwise he is a remarkable . prospect, the sort which commands a £40m price-tag. He was fast and . comfortable on the ball and keen and decisive in attack while strong in . defensive duels as he proved in the final seconds. IN. World Cup bow: Luke shaw started on the left for England in what he will hope will be the first of many appearances at the greatest show on earth . JACK WILSHERE: Plenty . of questions still to be answered, starting with his physical . condition. Can he stay injury-free? Is he fully fit? Has the zip that . takes him past opponents gone for good? Will it return as his fitness . improves? Has he enough in his game if it has gone? He can tackle but . can he defend? It cannot be easy with the pressure, because he is . perhaps the one England are most desperate to see develop. He punched in . and out. He adds aggression, forward thrust and vision with . quality on the ball to a midfield soon without Frank Lampard and . possibly Steven Gerrard. But he limped off again. IN. ADAM LALLANA: . The man who was the find of the friendlies from November to June was . suddenly dropped by Hodgson on the eve of the World Cup to accommodate . Sterling. England injected extra pace and dare but lost their balance. Lallana provides control and intelligence when he plays well. When he . first came in and flourished he seemed better with better players around . him,  made for international football, like Nick Barmby. He is . imaginative on the ball, the sort of thing required to unlock well . organised defences, but he was subdued. Perhaps confidence . has been knocked. Perhaps he needs more experience at the level. Perhaps . he is one for some team shapes and not others, but he is worth . persisting with. IN. Agonisingly close: Adam Lallana hits a shot past Oscar Duarte . ROSS BARKLEY: . Fresh and exciting, with wonderful footwork and the priceless ability . to go past defenders. In the heat of a competitive fixture against Costa . Rica – more competitive than might have been expected - and with the . added responsibility of starting the game, his shortcomings were more . clear than in the warm-up friendlies. As Hodgson pointed out after he . dazzled against Ecuador, he took risks in dangerous areas and struggled . at times to impose himself on the game. The manager may have called this . one right. He was targeted with some rough stuff and was . booked for a shirt pull. IN. DANIEL STURRIDGE: Wasted . good chances. Might have won the game but he is England’s most lethal . finisher and most consistent goal threat. He is sharp in tight spaces . and sees openings, if sometimes over-intricate and too ambitious. One of . the fundamental decisions of the summer for Hodgson concerns Sturridge . and Wayne Rooney. Does he devise a way to accommodate them both in . attack – possibly two up front with Sterling in behind, three . midfielders and the wingers sacrificed - or to choose one of them up . front and not the other? IN. The wrong side of the post: Daniel Sturridge squandered a fine chance to give England the lead against Costa Rica . RAHEEM STERLING: . Amazing in training, sent-off in Miami, flickered against Italy, . vanished against Uruguay and started on the bench against Costa Rica. When he came on, his first contribution was to put his head down and . dribble the ball out of play. Then he surrendered possession and put his . defence in trouble. It has been an adventure of highs and lows, but . Sterling seems unfazed at the idea of providing England’s extra . dimension. His pace is electric and he slices through a team in seconds. At this moment, he looks like the one to construct the next generation . around. IN. JOE HART: Done little wrong, yet barely made a save. Can be No1 for the next decade but would be nice if some pressure was applied. IN. BEN FOSTER: Kept a goal well against Costa Rica and has proved an able deputy to Hart, though he can be erratic. IN. Safe hands: Ben Foster holds on to a cross during a Costa Rica attack . FRASER FORSTER: Main contribution has been cameraman in the Gary Cahill’s video diaries as they tricked Joe Hart. OUT. GLEN JOHNSON: Time to look for a better right-back. There are a few around. One must step forward to claim the place. OUT. The end of an era: Glen Johnson (right) stretches with Liverpool team-mates Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling . LEIGHTON BAINES: Not enhanced case to be future left-back, but not well protected in his games. Much depends on Shaw’s progress. IN. GARY CAHILL: He’s not JT but it’s time for him to become the leader of this defence, organise and impose authority. IN. PHIL JAGIELKA: Brave and honest but limitations exposed at the very highest level. Strengthening in central defence is a priority. OUT. Time to go: England should move on from Rickie Lambert (left) and Phil Jagielka (right) STEVEN GERRARD: Time to go for his own sake, but no heir apparent in midfield is a big concern. Hodgson must delay his exit. IN. FRANK LAMPARD: See Gerrard, but two years older. Played well and a fine example to young players but time to go. OUT. Frustration: Jack Wilshere remonstrates with the referee after losing out on a decision . JAMES MILNER: Under-used as if Hodgson feared the “cautious” implications of his selection. His bite may solve central midfield issue. IN. JORDAN HENDERSON: Impressive in the friendlies, anonymous when the bar was raised. His energy is vital but does not pass it well. IN. ALEX OXLADE-CHAMBERLAIN: Ought to have gone home and replaced. Stuck around, got injured again. Key part of the future when fit. IN. Much maligned: But James Milner impressed against Costa Rica and should be used for future tournaments. DANIEL WELBECK: Sometimes looks the part, often doesn’t. More consistently may emerge if he finds regular club football. IN. RICKIE LAMBERT: England’s future should not hinge on a decent 32-year-old journeyman, despite his continued rise. OUT.

"The new season hasn't even started yet, but Brendan Rodgers is already facing a pivotal few weeks. Exactly how the manager goes about his business in the transfer market will shape Liverpool's campaign. With the club ready to sell prized asset Luis Suarez to Barcelona for a huge £80million, the Anfield coffers will be bursting. VIDEO Scroll down for Barcelona fans discuss the potential signing of Luis Suarez . Big shoes to fill: Brendan Rodgers has a huge task on his hands if shamed striker Luis Suarez is sold to Barcelona . But how exactly do you replace Suarez? It's not going to be easy. Rodgers has already signed Rickie Lambert from Southampton for £4million. The England international has his qualities, but he isn't a like-for-like replacement for the Uruguayan. Emre Can has arrived from Bayer Leverkusen for £9.75million - but the Germany Under-21 star is a box-to-box midfielder. Adam Lallana followed Lambert from St Mary's today in a deal understood to be worth £23million. Lallana was fantastic for the Saints last season; his call-up into England's World Cup squad a reward for his excellent campaign. But on the biggest stage of all in Brazil, Lallana, like most of the squad, failed to make an impact as England crashed out at the first hurdle. Comparisons: AVB went on a big spending spree when Gareth Bale was sold to Real Madrid but none of the new players managed to fill the massive void left by the midfielder . Club record signing: Roberto Soldado joined Tottenham from Valencia for a fee of £26million . Big money arrival: Paulinho joined Tottenham from Corinthians in 2013 for a fee of around £17million . The money is there at Anfield - but Rodgers must spend it wisely. Rodgers must ensure that he doesn't make the same mistakes Tottenham made in the transfer market last summer. The parallels between Liverpool and Spurs are obvious. The £85million sale of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid saw Andre Villas-Boas and sporting director Franco Baldini embark on a huge spending spree that saw the club smash their transfer record three times. First, Paulinho arrived from Corinthians for £17million, then Roberto Soldado for £26million from Atletico Madrid and then Erik Lamela from Roma for £30million. From the three, Paulinho is the only signing that resembles any sort of value for money. When it came to the crunch, Tottenham, despite spending in-excess of £100million on fresh talent, were missing one vital component: Bale. Controversial: Luis Suarez has been linked with a move to Barcelona after being banned from football for four months after biting Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup game between Uruguay and Italy . When such quality leaves a football club, it's nigh on impossible to replace. Rodgers will be mindful of that in his pursuit of trying to ensure Suarez's pending departure to the Nou Camp will not have a profound impact on his team. The Liverpool manager must decide whether to follow Spurs' example by trying to replace Suarez with several signings designed to strengthen his squad as a whole, or to spend the majority of the cash on one ready-made world class replacement. It's a tough call, but one that will shape Liverpool's season. Rodgers is interested in Benfica forward Lazar Markovic, who is viewed as one of the best emerging prospects in European football. New strike star: Rickie Lambert joined Liverpool from Southampton in £4million move . New Liverpool signing: Adam Lallana enjoyed a good season with Southampton but struggled to make an impact at the World Cup . VIDEO Rodgers 'excited' by signings . Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri, who will play in midfield for Switzerland versus Argentina later today, is also on Liverpool’s wanted list while the club hope to add Lille’s exciting forward Divock Origi. All three are under the age of 23, suggesting Rodgers would be buying potential rather than proven quality. But whoever comes in at Anfield this summer will be presented with a clear reference point of what is required. Thirty-one goals and 19 assists.

"It has been almost a year of anxious speculation. But when the moment came for a 'major character' on The Simpsons to be killed off, viewers were less than impressed. It was Krusty The Clown's father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky. Scroll down for video . Not so dramatic? Fans blasted the long-awaited death of a 'major' character on The Simpsons tonight . Goodbye: Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky, Krusty The Clown's father, was axed in the season 26 premiere . And if social media is anything to go by, the character voiced by Emmy winner Jackie Mason will not be missed. One Facebook user raged: 'Krusty's dad... Lame worst episode ever! Lol' Another said: 'I was more upset when Frank Grimes died. And he was only on one episode.' And one simply remarked: 'That death was not a main character.' Creators have spent 11 months giving tantalizingly cryptic interviews regarding the victim that would be axed in much-hyped episode. In April, executive producer Al Jean told reporters the actor who plays the character has won an Emmy award for his Simpsons work - but that applies to numerous actors, including all six members of the main cast: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer. Last week he refused to confirm or deny any of the suggested victims, saying: 'Some people have guessed it correctly, and some are really, really off.' When a reporter asked him if religion plays a part in the death, he simply replied 'yes'. Jean admits that he decided to make the episode a mysterious secret on a whim while speaking to journalists last fall. And he also revealed it is 'likely' Rabbi Krustofsky will return to the show in Krusty's dreams. He told Entertainment Weekly: 'I thought it would be a little sneaky to say that the character had won an Emmy and the next thing I knew it was a huge, worldwide story. Defense: Executive producer Al Jean said the rabbi is beloved but he did say the episode was over-hyped . 'So from that point on, we tried to tease it as best as possible but as you can see, there’s really about three clues you can give. It’s pretty obvious.' Jean even claims the episode title, Clown In The Dumps was made deliberately easy in order to play down the hype.

"A fake advert claiming Apple's new iOS 7 software makes iPhones and iPads waterproof is reported to have duped some users into breaking their devices by submerging them in water. The advert appeared on social networks, including Facebook and Twitter, earlier this week and is rumoured to have originated from online forum 4Chan. The advert shows an iPad and an iPhone 5S covered in water droplets, with the tagline: 'a smart-switch will shut off the phone's power supply and corresponding components to prevent and damage to your iPhone's delicate circuitry'. The advert, pictured, appeared on Facebook and Twitter. It made false claims that iOS 7 has a 'smart-switch' which prevents damage from water. It showed the new iPhone 5S covered in droplets with the tagline: 'Waterproofing covered by Apple's warranty policy'. The advert is believed to have originated from online forum 4Chan . Just two days after Apple's iPhone 5S handset went on sale, hackers found a way to bypass the new fingerprint sensor. They used a high-resolution photo of a fingerprint to create a laser-printed copy. Woodglue was poured onto the copy and, once dried, was peeled off and pressed onto the phone's TouchID sensor. The hackers were from German-based group Chaos Computer Club. It goes on to say that 'Waterproofing is covered by Apple's warranty policy.' The advert is said to look so much like an official Apple ad, some users have apparently trialled the feature and ultimately destroyed their handsets by getting them wet -  invalidating their warranties. Some have taken to Twitter, including one user who tweeted: 'Whoever said iOS 7 was waterproof **** you.' Other tweeters, such as Queen V said: 'Are people so gullible?', while Andy Porter slammed anyone who was duped as 'idiots'. Apple's iOS 7 software was released to iPhone users last Wednesday as a free upgrade. The new iPhone 5S and 5C handsets also come with iOS 7 pre-installed. There are a number of waterproof handsets on the market, including Sony's new Xperia Z1, Samsung's Galaxy S4 Active and Motorola Defy, however, Apple's handsets are not. Many warranty policies do not cover water damage, even if its accidental.

"Cristiano Ronaldo may have been some way from full fitness at this World Cup but he still managed to leave his mark, scoring his 50th goal for Portugal and becoming the first player from his nation to score in three consecutive finals. Paulo Bento’s side won 2-1 against Ghana at the Estadio Nacional thanks to Ronaldo’s late winner, but the three points were not enough to take them above USA, who lost 1-0 to Germany in the group’s other game. While the likes of Lionel Messi and Neymar have lit up the tournament with some sensational individual displays, their La Liga counterpart has struggled. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo sport a new haircut in training and photobomb reporter . Limping out: Ronaldo scored the winner against Ghana but looked to be in pain during the game . A knee complaint that blighted his final few matches of the domestic season followed him to Brazil, and clearly restricted his explosiveness – arguably the defining feature of his game. Luis Suarez showed against England how great players are able to summon moments of brilliance even when they are clearly far from full fitness. And against USA in Portugal’s previous match Ronaldo was able to do the same, saving the day for Paulo Bento’s side by swinging a perfect cross for Silvestre Varela to head home at the back post to make it 2-2 in the dying stages. Hounded: Ronaldo was given no time on the ball by Ghana's right-back Harrison Afful . Booking: Afful receives a yellow card after a handful of fouls on the Portugal star . Rough and tumble: Ronaldo limps away after the Afful foul that led to a booking . But, with Portugal requiring not just a victory but also a five-goal swing in their favour to have any hope of progressing to the last 16, it would have taken something superhuman from the Real Madrid star to drag his side through. Very rarely Ronaldo falls short on the football field, but on this occasion he almost had no say in the matter. He started the Ghana match well, summoning the spirit of Ronaldinho circa 2002 by crashing an effort against the bar that looked suspiciously like a cross in the sixth minute. Then midway through the half only a stunning point-blank save from Fatawu Dauda stopped him from making it 1-0 with a thumping header at the back post. So close: The Real Madrid attacker looks set to put Portugal ahead with a free header at the back post . Wonder save: But his effort was kept out by some fine goalkeeping by Fatawu Dauda . Celebrate: Dauda pumped his fists into the air after saving the header, as Ronaldo turned in desperation . Portugal were ahead shortly after, when . Ronaldo’s nemesis for the day John Boye fired an acrobatic own goal past . Dauda from close range. Determined: When John Boye scored an own goal Ronaldo grabbed the ball and ran back to the centre circle . A smart finish from Asamoah Gyan drew Ghana level on the hour mark, before Ronaldo appealed in vain for a penalty after being felled by Boye inside the box. With 10 minutes to play Ronaldo rattled a low strike into the bottom right corner after some shambolic defending from Ghana saw the ball fall to him 10 yards out. Crisp finish: Ronaldo makes history by scoring in three consecutive World Cup finals for Portugal . Bowing out: Ronaldo walks slowly back to the Portugal half knowing that his side are heading out . The goal had little impact on the final standings in Group G. It lifted Portugal above Ghana into third, but USA’s superior goal difference meant they join Germany in the knockout rounds. Ronaldo, well aware of this, celebrated accordingly. A short shrug and then a slow walk back to his own half. Maybe after the game he will reflect more proudly on a finish that takes his tally to 50 for Portugal and makes him the first Selecao player to score in three consecutive World Cup finals.

"A family have been awarded nearly £120,000 in compensation after a 'disastrous' trip to a Bulgarian hotel left them so ill that they are still suffering symptoms four years later. The group of 16 became sick just days after arriving at the all-inclusive Royal Park in the Black Sea resort of Elenite in 2010. Stephen Beever, 54, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, said his six children suffered so badly that they still have stomach cramps today. Stephen Beever and his seven-year-old daughter Lucy, who was celebrating her third birthday when she fell ill at the Royal Park Hotel in Elenite, Bulgaria in 2010 . 'Holiday from hell': The Royal Park Hotel in Elenite, Bulgaria, where the family stayed in 2010 . Mr Beever was on holiday with his wife Tina and their children, along with his brother and his wife Karie Westby and their children. He said that as well as vomiting and suffering abdominal pain, the children also developed a high fever. Mr Beever hit out at the 'appalling' and 'unhygienic' standards at the hotel, which led to the group experiencing severe abdominal pains. Conditions described by the family following their  two-week break include food being left uncovered for long periods of time, flies  seen on the meals and cockroaches in the restaurant and rooms. They also claimed the hotel's food appeared to be re-heated and re-used at meal times, and often appearing to be undercooked. Lucy Beever and her mother Tina. The family say their daughter is still suffering from her illness four years after falling sick during their holiday to Bulgaria in July 2010 . The family said they are still suffering after falling unwell at the Royal Park Hotel in Bulgaria . Some of the youngsters, including Liam Westby, 12, and his cousin Lucy Beever, seven, were celebrating their birthdays on the holiday, but were so ill that they spent the majority of their break in their room. Mr Beever, 54, said during the trip, his now seven-year-old daughter Lucy was crying continuously because of the pain in her abdomen. During her illness, she could not eat and even liquids were difficult for her to keep down. Mr Beever added: 'Our holiday at the Royal Park Hotel was a disaster and has caused a lot of problems following our return. 'At least once a week Lucy will suffer with stomach cramps that cause her pain and distress. 'It has affected her life and her confidence irreparably, and she is reluctant to get involved with after school groups because of her ongoing troubles. Liam Westby, now 12, and his mother Karie Ashforth, 31, left. Right, Liam Westby was celebrating his eighth birthday at the Royal Park Hotel when he fell severely ill . The Black Sea resort of Elenite in Bulgaria is popular with tourists . 'It means that she is missing out on lots of opportunities, which breaks my heart. 'Lucy and [her cousin] Liam were both celebrating their birthdays whilst we were in Bulgaria, which we hoped would make it a really special time for them. 'Sadly this is a birthday that we will never forget for all the wrong reasons.' She was taken to the on-site doctor, but the family were only advised to buy her over-the-counter treatment from a local pharmacy. Although this helped ease the symptoms, her illness, along with those of the other members of the family, lasted for the duration of the holiday. The illness also left the five children on the holiday with on-going stomach cramps and vomiting which their parents now worry will remain life-long problems. Lawyers Irwin Mitchell say they have also won settlements for 280 other holidaymakers who fell ill at the resort . Payout: The family of 16 have been awarded £119,000 after falling ill at Royal Park Hotel in Elenite, Bulgaria . Liam's mum, Karie Ashforth, 31, said: 'The children suffered horrifically during the holiday and it is awful to see them still struggling now. 'One of the worst aspects for Liam was having to miss football and time with his friends, things that a boy of his age should be enjoying without any worry. 'We felt that it was fair that we received a financial settlement of this order given that our family holiday was ruined by illness and due to the suffering we experienced then and thereafter. 'We will never forget the ordeal but hopefully we can draw a line under it and move on.' Specialist personal injury lawyers at Irwin Mitchell in London have now secured a settlement of around £119,000 for the group. Among them were six children, who were awarded a total of £90,000 at Sheffield County Court in September. The adults' within the family were given nearly £30,000. The group were awarded the settlement from tour operator Balkan Holidays Limited after representatives admitted primary liability for the illness. The Royal Park Hotel in Elenite, Bulgaria, where the family fell ill . Jatinder Paul, a travel law expert at Irwin Mitchell, representing the group, said: 'This large family suffered from dreadful symptoms such as stomach cramps, diarrhoea and lethargy. 'Aside from making their holiday extremely unpleasant, the illness has had a long-lasting impact, particularly for the young children involved. 'What should have been a two-week break for the family to spend together relaxing, ended up being ruined by the illness which left some of them confined to their rooms at times and has left some of them suffering with on-going symptoms. 'We hope that now the final settlement has been approved by the Court the family will be able to get on with their lives and put the experience behind them.' Irwin Mitchell also represented another group of more than 280 holidaymakers who suffered similar illness at the same Royal Park hotel in 2008. The group were awarded a payout totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds two years ago.","The group became sick just days after visiting Bulgaria's Royal Park Hotel .

"The EU is too busy tackling eurozone economies to help David Cameron claw back powers from Brussels, the French premier Manuel Valls has said . The EU is too busy tackling eurozone economies to help David Cameron claw back powers from Brussels, the French premier said last night. Mr Cameron has promised tough negotiations to bring about an overhaul of EU rules on free movement, which he says allow thousands of migrants to come here to claim benefits. But Manuel Valls, the socialist prime minister of France, said in London that the union is too preoccupied with tackling weak growth and high unemployment to overhaul its treaties and change the terms of Britain’s EU membership. After talks with Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, he said that opening up the EU treaties would be ‘perilous’ and unpicking the right of free movement of people would be ‘to call into question the very basis of the EU’. Mr Cameron has pledged to change the rules on free movement ahead of an in/out referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017. Only last week he told the Conservative party conference: ‘I know you want this sorted so I will go to Brussels. I will not take “no” for an answer when it comes to free movement – I will get what Britain needs.’ Mr Valls, a former interior minister, suggested he was prepared to discuss the conditions for migrants settling in other countries and reducing red tape. But, speaking to journalists after meeting financiers in the City of London, he added: ‘I don’t think the EU at the moment is ready for a shake-up of its treaties and institutions. The priority is jobs and growth.’ In comments reported in the Financial Times, Mr Valls said unpicking the principle of free movement of people and workers would be ‘to call into question the very basis of the EU’. He said that in any case, member states from eastern European Europe would oppose it. A Downing Street spokesman said that at their Number 10 meeting, Mr Cameron had raised freedom of movement with Mr Valls and reiterated his view that ‘this should not be an unqualified right’. Mr Valls told journalists: ‘I don’t think the EU at the moment is ready for a shake-up of its treaties and institutions. The priority is jobs and growth’ Mr Valls’ visit came as it was claimed that France faces the unprecedented humiliation of having its budget rejected by EU officials because of sky high levels of public borrowing. Brussels bureaucrats in the European Commission could demand the country tear up and rewrite tax and spending plans for next year to comply with borrowing rules. Officials are also likely to progress with ‘disciplinary’ action against France which could result in it being fined. The commission could also give France longer to meet budget rules, according to comments from anonymous euro zone officials reported by the news agency Reuters. It would be the first time the commission had used its power to demand changes to a national budget draft under new powers given to it last year. One official told Reuters: ‘It would save face for everybody. Even if it would be a bit humiliating for France, they probably know they cannot get away without anything. Mr Valls’ visit came as it was claimed that France faces the unprecedented humiliation of having its budget rejected by EU officials . ‘And it would also save face for Germany and the others, who are concerned about the longer-term effects, about not watering down the rules, but who also want to give France and its unpopular president a fighting chance.’ Sky high levels of unemployment and sclerotic growth have left Socialist President Francois Hollande’s approval rating at an all-time low of 13 per cent. Once praised by Ed Miliband for his left wing views, President Hollande now faces making embarrassing policy reversals to try and kick start the French economy. France was supposed to have brought its budget deficit below the EU ceiling of 3 per cent of GDP last year . Last year EU finance ministers gave it a two-year extension, until 2015, because of the continued euro zone recession. But last month Paris announced it was going to miss the 2015 deadline and would only hit the target by 2017. The commission will consider whether to allow the extended timetable if concessions are made. Last week the boss of John Lewis was forced into a grovelling apology after describing France as ‘finished’. Managing director Andy Street insisted his tirade against Europe’s second biggest economy had been ‘tongue-in-cheek’ after he described Paris’s Gare du Nord train station as ‘the squalor pit of Europe’ and said even the food and drink in London was better than that he had been offered in Paris. Speaking in the City of London, Mr Valls tried to put a brave face on his country’s economic woes. He admitted France needed to follow Britain’s efforts in restoring growth and pledged to cut taxes on growth. But he claimed Britain’s deficit was ‘substantially higher’ than France’s and that Britain was facing the ‘same challenges’ as France.","Manuel Valls said EU is too busy tackling eurozone economies .

"Within 30 years, a futurist believes babies will regularly born in artificial wombs, outside of human bodies. Stock image pictured . Within 30 years, a futurist believes babies will regularly be born in artificial wombs, outside of human bodies. The technology, known as ectogenesis, has been in development since 2001 and previous experiments involved growing mouse embryos in wombs attached to ‘placenta machines.’ Campaigners believe it could reduce the number of still births, because foetuses would be more closely monitored and accessible, but critics claim it could redefine social roles. Others have stated it removes the bond between a mother and her child. Ectogenesis is the growth of an organism outside of a body, and applies to animals as well as the growth of bacteria. Artificial wombs need an artificial uterus that supplies nutrients and oxygen to the foetus. Custom-built amniotic fluid sacs would also need to remove waste. This would be attached to an ‘placenta machine’, and cables could monitor everything from the baby’s weight to heart rate and development. It could be used for women who are unable to carry babies naturally, due to a damaged uterus for example. The technology may also remove the need for surrogate mothers for straight and gay couples. Elsewhere, artificial wombs would reduce the number of pregnancy and birth-related deaths among women, could extend the age at which women give birth, and drugs could be more easily administered to the foetus if it became ill. American-Hungarian futurist Zoltan Istvan told Motherboard he believes the technology will be ready to use within 20 years, and become widely available in 30. He claimed much of the technology already exists, but legal and ethical concerns will result in human trials being delayed. Ectogenesis was coined in 1924 by British scientist J.B.S. Haldane who predicted that by 2074 only 30 per cent of births would be natural, human births. In 2001, Hun-Chin Liu of Cornell University began growing sheets of endometrial tissue, and used them to create a uterus. They were tested using human embryos, which began to successfully grow, but had to be removed due to the laws of growing humans in a lab. In 2001, Hun-Chin Liu of Cornell University began growing sheets of endometrial tissue, and used them to create a uterus. Two years later, Professor Liu grew mouse embryos in an artificial womb, (pictured) however they did not grow to full-term and were left deformed . Two years later, Professor Liu grew mouse embryos in an artificial womb, however they did not grow to full-term and were left deformed. In 2009, researchers at Newcastle University announced they had created human sperm cells from embryonic tissue. ‘No doubt, propagating the species without the need for the human body sounds insanely far-fetched. 'And even if it’s achievable, there’s the question of whether people would be comfortable using it. I would argue yes,’ said Ivstan. Elsewhere, women who want an abortion could opt to place the embryo in an artificial womb so someone else could adopt it. In 2012, feminist and activist Andrea Dworkin raised criticisms about the technology. She said: ‘Women already have the power to eliminate men and in their collective wisdom have decided to keep them. ‘The real question now is, will men, once the artificial womb is perfected, want to keep women around?

'With her interests intact, I see no reason why the genetic mother should be empowered with life and death authority. Authority over her body, yes. But assuming it’s healthy, not over the [child’s] life.’","Ectogenesis technology has been in development since 2001 .

"Millions of us were gripped by the exploits of the Crawley family on the Christmas Day special of Downton Abbey last night. In just three years, the trials and tribulations of the Edwardian gentry and their below-stairs staff have made the show one of the most popular period dramas ever made. But its success has also had a dramatic impact on the lives of those living inside the ‘real’ Downton. Family seat: Lord and Lady Carnarvon of Highclere Castle, location for the television series Downton Abbey . While the fictional Earl of Grantham struggled to keep hold of his ancestral home, things have never looked better for the owners of Highclere Castle, where the ITV drama is filmed. Before Downton hit our screens, the 8th Earl and Countess of Carnarvon admitted their Berkshire estate needed £11.75million worth of repairs, including £1.8million of urgent work on the main house. Ravaged by damp and rot, at least 50 rooms were uninhabitable and its stone turrets were falling into disrepair. But after their friend, writer and producer Julian Fellowes, asked if he could film his new period drama at Highclere, it has become one of Britain’s best-known stately homes. As many as 1,200 visitors a day descended on the house in the summer, enabling the owners to begin major repairs. On the small screen: Highclere Castle in the background for a promotion photo for ITV's Downton Abbey . Lord Carnarvon, 55, said the show had ‘taken the pressure off’ for them financially. He said: ‘At the time that we were approached about Downton, it was just after the banking crisis and it was gloom in all directions. We had been doing corporate functions, but it all became pretty sparse after that. ‘Then Downton came along and we became a major tourist attraction. It has been a wonderful thing for us and our visitor numbers have doubled.’ Redundant buildings have been turned into tearooms and a three-year project to fix those distinctive turrets is finally under way. The only man who might be disappointed by news of Highclere’s success is Lord Lloyd-Webber. When the composer heard the family needed money for repairs, he offered to buy the property to house his art collection. It was a move that still rankles with Lady Carnarvon, 48. ‘We were completely astounded,’ she said. ‘I thought it was incredibly rude actually. It comes back to the old saying that an Englishman’s home is his castle. Geordie [the earl] loves this house, we all do and it is not for sale.’ Figures show the Carnarvons’ limited liability partnership Highclere Enterprises had cash assets of £329,685 for the year ending September 2011, compared with just £121,118 for 2010. But Lady Carnarvon is not taking anything for granted. She said: ‘Any bit of money we make here goes back into making another set of curtains or something like that. I enjoy that. If I wanted to have Manolo Blahnik shoes and a big flat in London then I would have married the wrong man, but if I want beautiful views and to walk through fields, then that’s what Highclere gives us.’ Helping hand: The television series about the Crawley family at Downton Abbey has given new life to Highclere, boosting visitors numbers and allowed much needed repairs . Highclere, which has been home to the Carnarvon family since 1679, was redesigned by architect Sir Charles Barry in the 19th century after he finished work on the Houses of Parliament. Yet it was not until 2009, when the first series of Downton hit our screens, that it was propelled to international fame. Today, it is used to promote Visit Britain’s campaign in the United States. The family moved into the main house from a cottage on the estate when the 7th Earl died in 2001. They now split their time between the two properties, leaving the main house during summer when it is open to the public. Lady Carnarvon said: ‘It is not an ivory tower. It is lived in and we hope that makes it more interesting to visitors.’ Extraordinarily, Lady Carnarvon says she has no idea how many rooms there are in their house. ‘I don’t know’, she says. ‘The archivist said there are between 200 and 300 rooms and 50 to 80 bedrooms.’ She did start counting one day with her son and nephew, but lost count after 13 rooms. ‘We started at the top of the first tower and counted coming down but when we got to the bottom the boys were bored and it was their holidays so we abandoned it.’ For now, the Carnarvons are too busy creating new business ventures to re-count the rooms. The series has led to a flurry of bookings for weddings and private events. Lady Carnarvon said: ‘We are lucky that people love Downton Abbey at the moment and that we have had three series, but I don’t think we take anything for granted. ‘I still wake up having a panic in the middle of the night about all sorts. I don’t assume it stays around.’","Highclere Castle is the set for ITV's Downton Abbey .

'While I'm confident the arrest will provide some comfort to Gerhard's family, who joined us in appealing for information earlier this year, we are still committed to bringing closure to the family,' Det Supt Holahan said. 'This case highlights the fact police will continue to investigate unsolved crimes regardless of when they were committed.'

"Mystery spin bowlers have bamboozled English batsmen for years but on Thursday at Lord’s the deception for once will be on the other hand when Sri Lanka will be forced to counter the unorthodox in this summer’s First Test. Moeen Ali will become the first England spinner with the doosra in his armoury to play Test cricket when he faces the kings of the unconventional and attempts to fill the massive gap left by the retirement of Graeme Swann. To add to the irony of England being the team with something outside of the ordinary in their ranks for this two-Test Investec series, it is a spinner who has long been their nemesis who provided Moeen’s inspiration. Mystery man: Ali has been working on his doosra, the off-spinner's delivery that goes the other way . Man in form: Moeen Ali is set to make his test debut on Thursday having impressed in the shorter forms . Saeed Ajmal has been both successful and controversial in equal measure against an England team traditionally suspicious of what can be viewed as a dark art, but he may have done them a huge favour in mentoring Moeen, 26, at Worcestershire. ‘I’ll be ready,’ said Moeen at Lord’s on Tuesday, as he prepared to become one of three Test debutants in the England team, along with opener Sam Robson, 24, and all-rounder Chris Jordan, 25. ‘I know what I need to do as a spinner and I’m sure I can do a good job.’ Swann’s job has been handed, for now at least, to a man who is principally a stylish middle-order batsman but who is adamant he can become a good enough spinner to dispel England’s specialist slow-bowling concerns. ‘I’m not here to try to replace him,’ said Moeen of stepping into Swann’s shoes. ‘I’m here to do exactly what I’ve been doing at Worcester. I’m a  batsman who bowls, at the moment, but I’m more than a part-time bowler and I have the potential to be a top spinner.’ He will try to do it, almost uniquely among Englishmen, by employing the doosra, the off-spinner’s delivery which turns away from the right-hander but which has always raised questions about its legitimacy. Dual role: Ali says he sees himself primarily as a batsman but can develop into a top quality spinner . Swing bowling all-rounder Gary Gilmour, who tore through England in the semi-final of the first World Cup in 1975, has died at 62. He battled health problems for years and complications escalated after a recent fall. The left-armer took six for 14 against England in the 1975 World Cup semi-final at Headingley. Gilmour (right) had a liver transplant in 2005 when former captain Ian Chappell and some old team-mates raised money for the surgery. ‘He was at the front of the queue when they were handing out talent, but unfortunately he was right at the back of the queue when they handed out health and good luck,’ said Chappell yesterday. Former Australia Test cricketer and popular broadcaster Kerry O’Keeffe said in a tweet: ‘Gus Gilmour has passed away... a sad day... had not an enemy in the game.’ Moeen told Sportsmail last month that he was prepared to bowl the wrong ’un this season after working on it at New Road with Ajmal, and now he is ready to unleash it on Sri Lanka after a successful experiment in county cricket. The visitors, meanwhile, will rely on orthodox slow-left armer Rangana Herath. ‘It’s coming on well and if I have a couple of good days of practice I’ll be ready to bowl it in this match,’ said Moeen, who estimates he has bowled eight doosras in County Championship cricket this season and five or six in each Twenty20 game. But with Sri Lanka’s Sachithra Senanayake being the latest mystery bowler to be reported for having a suspect action, during the fourth one-day international at Lord’s only last month, is Moeen confident it is legal? ‘The umpires have told me so far they can’t see the difference, so that’s a positive,’ said Moeen. ‘A lot of people have said they think it’s pretty sound and I can bowl it. I can’t wait to get my first wicket with it. Saeed told me once you get one or two wickets with it, you start bowling it a lot more.’ He is quick to praise Worcestershire’s overseas player. Doosra danger: Senanayake (left) has had his action questioned but Ali is confident in his own doosra . Swann song: Moeen insists he is not going to replace Graeme Swann but can offer something different . ‘Saeed has helped me loads,’ said Moeen. ‘He’s pushed me and given me a lot of confidence because it does take a bit of time to master it. You can’t beat the training I do with him.’ Clearly not everyone in the England camp agrees. Only last month, Stuart Broad appeared to question Ajmal’s action on Twitter, forcing the ECB to remind him of his social media responsibilities. Did Saeed have any message for Stuart? ‘No, he was just a little bit upset,’ admitted Moeen. ‘I haven’t spoken to Stuart about it. It’s none of my business. I just let them carry on.’ The wider significance of Moeen’s debut, as he explained to Sportsmail last month, is his determination to be a positive role model for young Muslims who, like him, grew up in inner-city areas with potential problems such as Birmingham. The beard he wears proudly as a sign of his Islamic faith — ‘the beard that is feared’ as a Worcestershire marketing  slogan has it — should be  an inspirational symbol for British Asians as he walks down the famous pavilion steps at Lord’s. Young guns: Chris Jordan (left) and Sam Robson (right) could both be in line to make their debuts this week . ‘The beard is a label for us to show we are Muslim, just as you would wear a school uniform,’ said Moeen, whose famous cricketing family will all be in attendance at Lord’s. ‘It represents being on your best behaviour all the time. It means a lot to me and to other people too. ‘In terms of trying to inspire other people with faith to play cricket, I am very proud of that.’ He is a significant as well as highly promising England cricketer.","England face Sri Lanka in first test on Thursday .

"Billy Joe Saunders' dream of becoming the first traveller to win a world title proved to be alive and well as he despatched Emanuele Blandamura to win the vacant European middleweight title. At just 24 years of age the 2008 Olympian has already established himself as the country's best at domestic level, owning the British title. Topping the bill in Manchester after the heavyweight match between Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora was scrapped, he made another significant step up, stopping his Italian opponent in the eighth round to claim the respected continental belt and move himself a step closer to a world title crack. Victor: Billy Joe Saunders celebrates his win . Overcome: He defeated Italy's Emanuele Blandamura . Saunders (19-0, 10KO wins) was eager to impress against 34-year-old Blandamura (22-0, 5KOs), who was unbeaten coming in but having never faced anyone of note. The southpaw looked slick as usual in the opening stages at the Phones4u Arena and a southpaw right looked hurtful in the second, only for Blandamura to bounce back with an immediate counter. Saunders seemed to be boxing within himself and was well ahead by the middle stages, though he did not have it all his own way. The Brit's occasional bolo punches were decent but rarely built upon, though his timing was impressive as usual. The action livened a little in the seventh as Saunders - who had failed to knock out his four previous opponents - engaged in more of a fight with Blandamura, himself with an unintimidating stoppage record. Too strong: He stopped his opponent in the eighth round . Class: The British fighter outshone his opponent in Manchester . A southpaw one-two landed on the Italian nicely but that was easily the highlight. It all changed in the eighth. After another scrappy period, Saunders pulled out a sublime right hook to leave Blandamura senseless on the ropes. The Englishman, smelling blood, charged forward and landed again as French referee Robin Delpierre moved in to administer a standing count. However, the Italian corner threw the towel in when they saw their man in dire straights and the official waved the fight off. On the undercard, Liam Smith pulled out a shot from nowhere in the sixth to keep his British light-middleweight title against midlander Jason Welborn. Welborn, from Rowley Regis, had been impressing the crowd with his intelligent pressure until Scouser Smith uncorked a lovely right to the body from which Welborn could not recover. Overcome: The Italian was overwhelmed in the end . Camaraderie:: Blandamura acknowledges his conqueror at the end of the bout . Walsall's Martin Gethin failed to reclaim the vacant British title when he was stopped by unbeaten Mancunian Terry Flanagan due to a hurtful injury to his right ear. Saunders immediately called out middleweight rival Chris Eubank Jr. 'It was a bit of a letdown of a fight,' he said. 'My timing was a bit out after 10 months out but I landed the shot.' 'If Eubank wants the fight and he's got a pair, let's fight. If he wants it, let him get in the ring.'","Saunders defeats Blandamura for European middleweight title .

"An employee of an Idaho trucking company abandoned a trailer containing thousands of pounds of frozen chicken at a western Montana truck stop after the company reportedly refused to pay a ransom for the poultry, Missoula County officials said. The 53-foot trailer, dripping the rancid juices of rotting chicken, was discovered Tuesday near the Flying J Truck Stop west of Missoula, the Missoulian reported. Truck stop manager Crystal Friede said the trailer had been there since at least Saturday. It contained 35,000 pounds of chicken worth $80,000, officials said. A semitrailer carrying 35,000 pounds of frozen chicken is abandoned at a western Montana truck, pictured on Wednesday . The trucker reportedly texted Dixie River Freight Inc. saying he'd return the chicken in exchange for a ransom, sheriff's spokeswoman Paige Pavalone said Wednesday. The Nampa, Idaho, trucking company refused his offer and reported the truck missing. A woman who answered the phone at Dixie River declined to comment to The Associated Press. Pavalone said the sheriff's office didn't know if the truck driver had been located. Officials with the county health department were at the truck stop Wednesday trying to figure out the best way to dispose of the load as temperatures in the Missoula area topped 90 degrees. 'It would be ideal to only have to deal with it once,' said Shannon Therriault, environmental health supervisor with the Missoula County Health Department. 'We don't want rotting chicken dripping from here to who knows where. If It's leaking a little now, if you move it, more can happen.' Republic Services, a trash removal and recycling company, has an expert on staff to deal with rotten poultry, Therriault said. 'We'll try to figure out, between parties, the best way to have the least amount of contact with the contents,' she said. Meanwhile, Dixie River's insurance company will have to determine if the truck can be cleaned well enough to use again, Therriault said.","Employee of Idaho trucking company abandoned the trailer after the company refused to pay a ransom for the poultry .

Bosnia became the latest team to be eliminated from the World Cup when Stoke City forward Peter Odemwingie scored the winning goal in Cuiaba past club-mate Asmir Begovic. But they will depart their first World Cup feeling aggrieved after Edin Dzeko had a goal wrongly chalked off for offside when the score was 0-0 and then Odemwingie’s struck in controversial circumstances after 29 minutes. Emannuel Emenike sent Bosnia skipper Emir Spahic to the floor with a robust challenge before setting up Odemwingie to fire home from eight yards. And in an agonising finale, Dzeko hit the post when a goal would have kept Bosnia's tournament hopes alive.

But they faced a rejuvenated Nigeria who offered a lot more than their turgid goalless draw with Iran would have suggested. It was a bright start for Africa’s most populous nation. 21-year-old striker Ahmed Musa, who plays his club football in the Russian League with CSKA Moscow, was a whisker away from applying a finishing touch after the ball flashed dangerously across the Bosnia goal. John Obi Mikel shot wide when well-placed – which wouldn’t surprise Chelsea fans – and Begovic was forced to tip away from Ogenyi Onazi as Bosnia were put under the cosh. But Bosnia, who have only been members of Fifa for 18 years, were robbed of the first goal after 21 minutes when Dzeko timed his run to perfection to convert a clever through pass by Miralem Pjanic. The City forward, with 10 goals in qualification, couldn’t believe it as he turned to celebrate and saw the linesman’s flag in the air for offside, when he’d been half-a-yard on. Ironically, it was the only chance Dzeko put away. Four more times he had opportunities to score but was twice denied by Nigeria’s excellent goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama and twice missed the target.

Bosnia’s frustration increased when Nigeria took the lead. Spahic tried to block the run of Emunike but when the powerful striker bundled over him in retaliation and the Bosnia captain fell to the floor, New Zelaand referee Peter O’Leary waved play on. From the resulting cross, Odemwingie scored emphatically to leave Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi glad he’d patched up his differences with the Premier League forward who didn’t play for his country for two years.

But his low shot was saved by Enyeama late on while substitute Vedad Ibisevic, who scored against Argentina, failed to head in from a corner with Bosnia’s best chance of the second half.

"The inspiration for Sherlock’s new nemesis? Well, that’s elementary. The show’s co-creator has previously gone on record criticising a certain real-life foreign Press baron who is an unashamed capitalist. So it was little surprise when Sherlock Holmes’ new enemy was unveiled in last night’s series finale – as a sinister foreign newspaper baron and unashamed capitalist. The detective describes his enemy Charles Augustus Magnussen – played by Danish actor Lars Mikkelsen – as a ‘shark’ who uncovers secrets about the great and the good which he uses to blackmail them. Scroll down for video . Villain of the piece: Lars Mikkelsen as Charles Augustus Magnussen with Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch . He adds: ‘I’ve dealt with murderers, psychopaths, terrorists, serial killers. None of them can turn my stomach like Charles Augustus Magnussen.’ As for the rest of the show, in a dramatic plot twist, Dr John Watson’s new wife, Mary, shoots Sherlock, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, after Magnussen discovers that she had a secret past as an assassin for foreign intelligence agencies. She then steals the identity of a dead woman to marry the detective’s sidekick. Luckily, she ensures the shot is not fatal, enabling Sherlock to recover and later turn a gun on the villain. The not-so-subtle depiction of the evil press baron was created by the series’ co-writer, Steven Moffat, who has previously ranted against Right-wing media and declared his dislike of the Conservatives. 'None can turn my stomach like Charles Augustus Magnussen': The show's new villain shares has similarities to another foreign press baron . In an interview with the Guardian before the last general election in March 2010, he declared: ‘I hope the Tories don’t win. Let’s not beat around the bush.’ Former teacher Mr Moffat also launched a scathing attack on James Murdoch, the son of Rupert Murdoch and the then head News International, which owns The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun. He said: ‘Are we really going to put James Murdoch in place of [the BBC]? ‘Can you imagine how s*** everything would be? Never mind the fine and glorious things that the BBC does, imagine how s*** everything would be! Stuff would be s***! Let’s not have really good restaurants, let’s have Kentucky Fried Chicken!’ In another possible indication of the views of the show’s creators, Sherlock himself was seen reading a copy of the Guardian during last night’s episode. And is not the first time the show has . been accused of blatant Left-wing bias; the previous episode featured a . thinly veiled attack on Boris Johnson, calling the Mayor of London . ‘dithering, incoherent, and self-interested’. Mr . Johnson last week accused the BBC of bias after a spoof newspaper story . which flashed up briefly on screen during an earlier episode of . Sherlock. Shock: Dr Watson's new wife, Mary, shoots Sherlock in a rather dramatic twist in the series finale . The mock article revolved around the Mayor of London turning the Thames into a motorway. Although Mr Johnson was not mentioned by name, the article said that the plans followed a list of ‘bizarre concepts’, including a ‘recently-mocked concept of putting an airport in the middle of the estuary’ – a clear reference to the mayor’s so-called ‘Boris Island’ proposal. The page included a quote from the ‘current Mayor’ which appeared to mock Mr Johnson’s use of language, finishing with the exclamation ‘huzzar!’ It said: ‘When asked to explain how the system might move forward, or even be profitable, or perhaps even to explain the point, the Mayor, who was at a self-promotion event, was found to be dithering, incoherent, and self-interested’. Mr Johnson said afterwards: ‘It is elementary my dear Watson, I deduce a simple case of BBC bias.’ He added that spending taxpayers’ money attacking Conservative politicians was the BBC’s ‘raison d’etre’. The BBC insisted that the newspaper and Mayor featured in the episode were entirely fictional and were not named or ‘politically affiliated.’","Holmes' enemy unveiled in series finale - a sinister newspaper baron .

"Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 1-0 victory against Italy on Tuesday has attracted headlines worldwide. The incident is the third time that the Liverpool striker has been caught sinking his teeth into an opponent and the 27-year-old now faces disciplinary action from FIFA who have the power to ban him for up to two years. But how significant is the story in Uruguay, Italy and Spain? Sportsmail takes a look at the front pages of their sporting publications on the forward. Ignored: Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini isn't mentioned in any of the Uruguayan front pages . What news? The Uruguayan papers focus on their country's 1-0 Group D win against Italy on Tuesday . Rather notably in Uruguay, the incident isn't mentioned anywhere in their front pages with the South American's qualification to the last-16 taking precedence. La Republica headlines with 'Soul, heart and back' - referring to the body part that captain Diego Godin scored the match winning goal, while El Telegrafo goes with 'Heading to the Second Round!'. La Diaria and and El Obsevrador also ignore Suarez's antics as the country prepares for their clash against Colombia on Saturday at the iconic Maracana Stadium. Big deal? Tuttosport is the only Italian paper that marks Suarez's bite as a reason for their World Cup exit . Surprisingly in Italy, the incident plays second fiddle with all their papers' focus on the Azzurri's World Cup group exit. It is the second time in succession that the four-time champions have bowed out early at the World Cup to the condemnation of their publications. Only Tuttosport leads with Suarez as one cause for their exit in Brazil with the headline 'Godin and the referee send Uruguay into the knockout round as Suarez bites Chiellini.' More pressing matters: Italy's World Cup exit in the group stage takes precedent over Suarez's bite on Chiellini in most of their Wednesday papers including La Gazzetta dello Sport (left) and Corriere dello Sport (right) Elsewhere the story is just a side-note as the fallout on Italy's Group D demise begins. Corriere dello Sport and La Gazzetta dello Sport focus on Claudio Marchisio's red card in the second-half as well as Cesare Prandelli's immeadiate resignation as national team coach and Giancarlo Abete's as president of the Italian FA. Spanish paper AS slams Suarez for his actions. They lead with the headline 'Luis Suarez bites for a third time' with a picture of Chiellini showing the referee his attacked shoulder. Man-eater: AS slam Suarez stating that the Barcelona and Real Madrid target has cannibalistic tendencies . The publication expands that further with it's front page depicting the previous two incidents that the forward has bit someone on a football pitch - in 2010 on PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal whilst at Ajax and last year on Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic for Liverpool. The 27-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona in the past and AS adds that 'the number nine who the duo want has cannibalistic tendencies.

"Tragic: Ned Vizzini, 32, committed suicide in New York on Thursday . An author who shot to fame after the publication of his book about his experiences with depression as a teenager has died after committing suicide. Ned Vizzini, 32, was found dead in New York on Thursday after more than a decade of acclaim as a young adult author, according to the Los Angeles Times. One of Vizzini's books, 'It's Kind of a Funny Story', was turned into a 2010 movie starring Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts. That memoir won the Young Adult book . award by the American Library Association in 2007 and detailed his . depression, suicidal thoughts and ensuing trip to a psychiatric . hospital. When the book was . published seven years ago, he gave an interview to The New York Times . wherein he answered questions from parents whose children were also . struggling with depression and he admitted that while he definitely felt . much better it was a life-long struggle. 'The . first and most important step I took happened a week after I left the . psych hospital, when I realized, while looking over my receipts of all . things, that suicide was not an option,' he said in the 2006 interview. Memoir: The book, and ensuing film starring Zach Galifianakis and Emma Roberts, 'It's Kind Of A Funny Story' was based on Vizzini's trip to a psychiatric ward as a teenager following suicidal thoughts . Depression: In interviews, Vizzini (seen here with his wife Sabra Embury) talked about how while he did still battle mental demons, his trip to the psych ward convinced him that suicide was not the answer . 'I had wasted so much time thinking about it and mulling over its intricacies and artistic seductiveness; starting right then and there I crossed it out as an option. From then on it was a hard road — even though I didn't want to kill myself, I didn't really want to live either and I withdrew into oversleeping and under-eating.' The success of It's Kind Of A Funny Story, which was his third book, helped springboard his writing career and he went on to collaborate on television shows like MTV's Teen Wolf, ABC's The Last Resort. He was working with J.J. Abrams and Gravity director Alfonso Cuaron at the time of his suicide yesterday. 'We are incredibly saddened at the loss . of our dear friend and colleague Ned Vizzini. On behalf of everyone in . the Believe family, we offer our deepest condolences and heartfelt best . wishes to his friends and family, especially his wife and son, at this . most challenging of times,' Mr Cuaron said in a statement in conjunction . with Bad Robot productions. Left behind: Vizzini and his family (pictured) lived in LA but he was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York . Sad: Vizzini is seen here posing for photos with his two year old son . He was married to fellow writer Sabra Embury and the couple has a two year old son . 'He was also incredibly kind and he adored his family and friends,' his publisher Alessandra Balzer said in a statement. 'At his signings, countless kids would approach him to say that he changed their lives — he gave them hope.'

"Will Brazil win the World Cup without Neymar? Colombia defender Juan Zuniga has sent a message of support to Neymar amid criticism of the challenge which has ruled the Brazil talisman out of the rest of the World Cup. Neymar suffered a fractured vertebra in a strong challenge from Zuniga near the end of Friday night's quarter-final clash in Fortaleza. The right-back caught Neymar with a knee in his back that went unpunished during Brazil's 2-1 win and the Brazilian left the pitch on a stretcher and in tears. FIFA's disciplinary committee is studying the challenge to decide on action against Zuniga, while Ronaldo, Brazil's former World Cup-winning striker, believes the Colombian intended to hurt Neymar.Zuniga defended his challenge immediately after the match and on Saturday emphasised he had meant Neymar no harm.

"Liverpool and Barcelona will open negotiations over the proposed £80million transfer of disgraced star Luis Suarez. Sportsmail understands Liverpool officials, including managing director Ian Ayre, have agreed to meet Raul Sanllehi, Barcelona’s director of football management, in London to discuss their valuation of the 27-year-old. Barcelona are looking to strike a compromise of around £60m, based on the fact that Suarez is banned from football for the next four months following his bite on Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini. Liverpool will not be swayed from their valuation of Suarez but will revive their interest in Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez as part of the negotiations. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ruud Gullit: Suarez bite would make me crazy . On the move: Barcelona have secured the services of Luis Suarez from Liverpool, reports AS in Spain . Controversy: Suarez's World Cup ended in disgrace when he was banned for four months after biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini . Barcelona value the Chile international at £35m following his performances in the World Cup and have already rejected a £20m offer from Juventus for the 25-year-old. Suarez set the wheels in motion for his transfer after apologising on Monday for his attack on Chiellini. The Uruguayan’s statement of contrition was viewed as a necessary step by Barcelona prior to their official bid and was met warmly by sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta. ‘Suarez has shown he is humble enough to admit an error, which is very important,’ said Zubizarreta.Zubizarreta was speaking at the presentation of Barcelona’s latest signing Ivan Rakitic, whosaid Suarez’s apology ‘says a lot about him as a person’.

Suarez is understood to be taking advice from Spanish lawyer Juan de Dios Crespo to help him in his appeal against his ban. De Dios Crespo helped Barcelona fight their transfer ban for infringing regulations in signing youth-team players from abroad and is an expert on FIFA’s procedures. Suarez’s defence is now likely to include an admission that he bit Chiellini, a display of contrition and a plea for mitigation. It is likely that he will face a reduced ban and could be playing for Barcelona early next season if he leaves Liverpool.

"Rail union firebrand Bob Crow has thanked his movement's nemesis Margaret Thatcher for helping him get his job. The RMT boss revealed if it wasn't for the former Tory Prime Minister he would never have been elected because she changed the rules on trade union ballots. Crow has attracted criticism after it was revealed he jetted off on a luxury holiday to Brazil before last week's London Underground strike. Under fire: Union leader Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT union, stands outside City Hall, London . In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Crow said: 'I suppose I've got Margaret Thatcher to thank for my career. The truth is I'd never have been elected if it wasn't for her. 'Our rulebook used to say you couldn't stand as general secretary unless you were a member of the Labour Party. I wasn't But Maggie did away with that rule because she thought people from the business community would take up union jobs.' Speaking about his £10,000 holiday, Crow said it was booked a year ago for his girlfriend Nicola Hoarau's 50th birthday. The union chief was seen sipping contentedly from a coconut and baking on a golden beach in his Bermuda shorts as officials in rain-lashed Britain tried to halt the 48-hour strike in London.

Crow was seen baking on a golden beach in his Bermuda shorts as officials in rain-lashed Britain tried to halt the 48-hour strike in London . Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher acknowledging applaud on at the end of the Conservative Party conference in Blackpool . Speaking in The Sun today, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said Bob Crow is hypocrite who is depriving a poor family of a council house. He said: 'Taxpayer-funded homes are there to help Brits on lower wages. We have a duty to help our neighbours if they genuinely need support. 'Britain is a caring society, with a safety net to be proud of. But Bob Crow is taking the mick. He thinks this safety net should be a hammock.' Crow, who takes home a £145,000-a-year pay package, has . also faced criticism for living in a housing association home in . Woodford Green, east London, intended for less well off people at a . subsidised rate. Crow recently said he had 'no moral duty' to move out of his home: 'I was born in a council house; as far as I'm concerned, I will die in one.' However, . today it was revealed he is facing the prospect of having his rent . doubled to the market rate under new government rules on wealthy . tenants. The Sunday Times revealed from next year Crow and his family could see their rent increase by about £175 a week following new rules affecting an estimated 21,000 households in social or council accommodation who earn £60,000 or more. The house, understood to be in Hoarau's name, is owned by London & Quadrant housing association, which charges other families on the street £150 a week. Crow and Hoarau are believed to pay £175 because their home is an end of terrace property. Housing minister Kris Hopkins said: 'We intend to give landlords the option to charge very high-earning social tenants want to continue using this precious national resource, they will pay for the privilege.'","The RMT boss revealed Thatcher's union reforms benefited him .

"Four down, two to go. On a miserable day for British men not called Murray, a defeated quartet beat quick retreats from the All England Club with £108,000 between them. That was the reward for first-round failure for James Ward, Daniel Cox, Kyle Edmund and Daniel Evans, all wildcards and £27,000 richer to a man. Only Daniel Smethurst still has a chance to join Andy Murray in the second round, but first the world No 234 must today face John Isner, an American located 223 places higher up the ladder. One hugely unlikely result would change the perception, of course, but it wouldn’t address the annual question of whether these British men get more than they deserve. Exit strategy: James Ward and Daniel Cox were both first round losers at the Wimbledon Championhips . Exception to the rule: Andy Murray made a winning return in defence of his Wimbledon title . The point was underlined by the four winning only two sets between them, albeit there must be some mitigation for the quality of opposition, with Cox, ranked 214, taking a set off world No 42 Jeremy Chardy in losing 6-2, 7-6, 6-7, 6-3. Evans’ result was particularly disappointing, the 24-year-old losing 6-1, 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 to Andrey Kuznetsov, the world No 118 from Russia, while James Ward, the British No 3, was crushed 6-2, 6-2, 6-1 by Mikhail Youzhny, the 17th seed. Ward, 27, who has now lost four of five first-round matches here, said the £27,000 prize money — up £3,500 on last year — was likely the difference between having a career and not, saying: ‘If you have a coach or a trainer around you, obviously it becomes expensive to travel the world. But, it’s a massive help. I’m very grateful for the help I’ve always received from the All England Club and the LTA. Without that I wouldn’t be able to carry on playing probably.’ Vital: Kyle Edmunds and Daniel Evans (R) might not be able to afford to play without Wimbledon prize money . Unlikely: Daniel Smethurst is only other British male who can join Murray in the second round . Evans, the British No 2, appeared close to tears as he explained his defeat, but remains hopeful of ultimately cracking the top 100, having indicated several years that he would leave the game by now if he failed to so. He said: ‘If I was knocking 280, that sort of ranking, I wouldn’t carry on. But I’m beating some good players along the way. I’ve got a decent chance (of top 100) still. Edmund, coached by Greg Rusedski, lost 6-3, 7-6, 6-2 against Austria’s Andreas Haider-Maurer, and said: ‘British players are not highly ranked which means  everyone we’re going to play, the opponent is expected to win. So that’s why you see some early first-round exits.’ VIDEO Wimbledon Day One review .","James Ward, Daniel Cox, Kyle Edmund and Daniel Evans lost in the first round at Wimbledon .

"The creator of Teletubbies has warned that home-grown children’s television programming is in terminal decline. Anne Wood said the industry has been ‘struggling for many, many years’ despite more channels being launched. Since Teletubbies was first broadcast 18 years ago, the amount of new children’s programmes has dropped dramatically. In 1998, repeats made up  38 per cent of children’s programmes – by 2011, the figure was 91 per cent, according to Ofcom. Anne Wood, creator of the Teletubbies, pictured, who says home-grown children's TV programmes are in terminal decline . Pact, the industry body for independent TV producers, recently called for a tax break for children’s programmes to boost British commissions. Blaming budget cutbacks, Miss Wood told BBC Radio 4 that one of the reasons for fewer programmes was because ‘the number of people who commission have disappeared’. It comes after the head of TV regulator Ofcom said earlier this month that children’s TV is ‘not as good as it would ideally be’. Some argue that the ban on junk food advertising has decreased the revenue available to commercial broadcasters - but the BBC is also forecast to cut its spending. Chief executive John McKay said: ‘Our children’s television production is respected worldwide and we hope that ministers will agree that this is a special part of cultural heritage that is worth government’s support.’ Since Teletubbies was first broadcast 18 years ago, the amount of new children's programmes has dropped dramatically . Pact says a tax relief scheme would boost co-production opportunities, particularly with the US market, and would improve exports of home-grown shows. The body claims that only one in five of all children’s programmes aired on British TV is made in the UK. But Miss Wood said tax breaks are only part of the solution and called for a fundamental re-examination of the market. She said: ‘The health of the sector requires there to be more places where you can be properly commissioned - so if one channel doesn’t take your work, you have at least got somewhere else to go with it because children are not getting diversity’.","Anne Wood warns home-grown children's show are in terminal decline .

The young women, who make up just some of the 60 finalists in the pageant, the winner of which will go on to compete in Miss World . The annual beauty contest is staged in Torquay, with the swimwear portion being photographed in the famous marina, and the winner will be crowned later this month . Another of the girls, Miss Cornwall, . Emma Smith, 22 was bullied at school because of a lazy eye - but turned . the tables on her tormentors by getting straight As in her A-levels and . going to medical school. Constants this year include medical students as well as psychology students, dancers  and trainee accountants . The women seemed to be enjoying the photo shoot, despite the rather unpredictable British summertime weather . The young models lapped up the sun on the deck of a yacht before heading to nearby Torre Abbey Beach for more photos . The annual beauty contest is staged in Torquay where last year local MP Adrian Sanders said it was an 'own goal' for women. His . comments were dismissed by a previous winner Charlotte Holmes, from . Torpoint, Cornwall, who said this was precisely the sort of stereotyped . view the girls were hoping to challenge. And the woman behind the Miss England contest has come to its defence. Founder of the Miss England competition Angela Beasley argues that despite appearances: 'It's not just about turning up in a swimsuit and looking pretty' Miss Nottingham, Rebecca Drysdale and Miss English, Riviera Leanne Ward (left) and Miss London, Tammy Dexter and Miss Hampshire, Charlotte Giles, splash around in the waves (right) Director Angela Beasley said accusations that the contest was inappropriate nowadays were old-fashioned. The swimwear round of the competition was launched on Monday at Torquay Marina amid reports there was unease that it was getting a £7000 subsidy from Torbay Council to stage the show. But Angela Beasley said the view that beauty pageants were degrading was outdated. The contestants have their own Baywatch moment as they run out of the no doubt rather chilly English sea onto the beach . She said: 'We've come a long way from girls just turning up with their heels and swimsuit and walking on a catwalk to be judged. 'Now girls take part in various rounds including a tough sports round - you have to be physically fit. 'The current Miss England ran the London Marathon this year and raised thousands of pounds for childrens' charities. 'Miss England is about being a good role model. 'There's a talent round where the girls submit their talent - what they think they're good at. 'They have to be good at something - it could be their jobs or something they enjoy doing. 'There's an eco-fashion round where the girls have to create an outfit using recycled materials - they have to be creative. As well as the swimwear round, the competition now includes a sports round and an Eco-fashion round . Miss London Tammy Dexter, Miss Bristol Naomi Dunbar and Miss Leicestershire Holly Desai enjoy frolicking for the camera . Despite many feeling the bikini portion of the competition is demeaning to women, the 14 contestants showed off their bodies with seeming joy . 'It's not just about turning up in a swimsuit and looking pretty. 'Modelling competitions are about just looks alone. 'Miss England is about being a good all-rounder and a good role model. This year alone, we had 20,000 girls apply to enter the competition. 'When people stop applying to be a role model we'll stop holding the competition.' Current Miss England Kirsty Heslewood also said she felt the pageant was positive. 'I feel it empowers women to do good things for their country, their communities and be good role models. 'It's completely changed from how it used to be. 'It promotes fitness and good health.'","Some of final 60 contestants posed for photos following swimwear round .

"author] . The tax-man would be Floyd Mayweather’s most dangerous opponent if his application for a license to promote in New York really were to mean him fighting there himself. Marcos Maidana would be unlikely to inflict as much damage on Mayweather as the IRS if they were to take a mutual bite out of the Big Apple on September 13. Speculation that Mayweather is planning to move that world title rematch from Las Vegas to the other city that never sleeps has been rife since that application was approved by the New York State Athletic Commission. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mayweather offers Maidana September re-match . Money man: Floyd Mayweather has secured a license for New York but is unlikely to fight there himself . The far greater likelihood is that he is looking to New York as a venue for other boxers in the Mayweather Promotions stable now that he is severing links with Golden Boy. Oscar De La Hoya’s company has been fronting Mayweather’s mega-bucks fights of late but a schism has followed the acrimonious departure of chief executive Richard Schaefer from Golden Boy. Schaefer may well be hired by Mayweather to oversee his independent shows in the future, although De La Hoya is claiming that there is one fight remaining on the Golden Boy contract. If that is enforceable, the pair would make uneasy bedfellows in September. Although the man who calls himself Money . would surely find that preferable to losing a sizeable chunk of the $50 . million-plus he can expect to bank for fighting Maidana again. Rematch: Mayweather's bout against Marcos Maidana (right) is more likely to be held in Las Vegas . And that is what would happen if Mayweather boxed in either Madison Square Garden or the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn. In addition to paying US income tax Mayweather would be liable for a further 8.82 per cent state deduction from his purse, plus four per cent New York City tax. On a $50 million pay-night those state and city extras would cost him almost $6.5 million, while none of those additional levies are imposed on boxers by Nevada or Las Vegas. The question is why would Mayweather do that, when he prefers fighting in his adopted home town in the desert anyway? Almost certainly the answer is that he won’t. Another bout: After Mayweather severed ties with Golden Boy promotions, former champion turned promoter Oscar De La Hoya claims his company is owed one more bout under his banner . The MGM Grand Garden is his favourite work-place and is believed to have been reserved for him for the Mexico Independence celebration weekend, which always brings to Vegas thousands of high-rolling boxing afficionados from south of the border. Expect it to remain so for another big Mexican holiday in May, when our own Amir Khan may finally get his shot at dethroning the pound-for-pound king. Mayweather tends to delay not only hand-picking opponents but confirming the venue, presumably to crank up the site fee a little. But when push comes to punch for this man, there is no place like home. With the exquisite timing which hall-marked his halcyon years, Evander Holyfield announced his retirement on the 17th anniversary of having his ear bitten off by Mike Tyson, which came also during the weekend of the iron man’s 48th birthday. The fortunes of these two immense champions are inextricably linked and despite that outrage in the Las Vegas ring they have become firm friends. That bond has been strengthened by the way they both squandered hundreds of millions of dollars earned the hard way and are working to rebuild their lives. Friends: Evander Holyfield (left) and Mike Tyson (right) are close now despite their infamous rivalry . The many mansions are long gone, with Holyfield having moved out of his answer to Buckingham Palace on the outskirts of Atlanta to a modest downtown apartment. So are some of the wives, although both men continue to make provision for all their children, as best they can. At 51, amid concerns about his tendency to sometimes slur his words, Holyfield’s belated hanging up of the gloves comes as something of a relief to the world of boxing. Hopefully, the celebrity status built on his heroic exploits in the ring will provide a comfortable living hereafter. Controversy: Tyson infamously bites a section of Holyfield's ear off during their clash in 1997 . Reaction: Referee Lane Mills (centre) stops the fight in the third round as Holyfield checks his gnawed-upon ear . In becoming the undisputed world champion at both cruiserweight and heavyweight Holyfield fought everyone, ducked no-one. In terms of the number of times one heavyweight has won the world title, he alone surpassed Muhammad Ali when he became champion a fourth time. It would have been five had he not been robbed of a decision against Russian giant Nikolai Valuev, at the grand old age of 46. Tyson, Larry Holmes, George Foreman, Buster Douglas and Britain’s greatest, Lennox Lewis, are but a few of the  huge names on Holyfield’s  resume. But it is the extraordinary  trilogy with Riddick Bowe - one  a Fight of the Year, one including the Round of the Year, one interrupted by the crash-landing of a para-glider in the open-air Vegas ring – which marked the summit of an epic career embracing 57 fights with 44 wins, 29 of them by knock-out. Whoever nicknamed  Evnander Holyfield The Real Deal could foresee the future. Not one to duck: Lennox Lewis (left) stands among the greats on Holyfield¿s esteemed resume . As Canelo Alvarez continues his comeback this Saturday from his solitary defeat by Floyd Mayweather he will not only be seeking victory over Erislandy Lara but looking to evict Mr Money from his country’s patriotic fight dates in Las Vegas. While those September and May schedules are lucrative for Mayweather, Alvarez insiss they are more relevant for himself as the poster boy for Mexican boxing. He hopes to put down a big marker to that effect with this fight in Mr Money’s favourite arena, the MGM Grand Garden. Comeback: Canelo Alvarez (left during his only defeat to Mayweather) returns on Saturday against Erislandy Lara, and if he wins could also clash with Mayweather over preferred dates for his next bout in Vegas . Having despatched the tough Alfred Angulo with a tenth round stoppage in one light-middleweight non-title fight, the Cinammon Kid hopes to inflict something similar on Lara. As it happens, a second convincing win in succession might even get him, like Marcos Maidana two months from now, a rematch with Mayweather. Then they could both pack Sin City again – and in the process make another fortune in pesos as well as dollars. Alvarez-Lara will be televised live on BoxNation late Saturday night. So Kell Brook’s long-awaited world welterweight title challenge is scheduled at last – against America’s Shawn Porter in California in August. It’s about time, gentlemen. No more injuries, Mr Brook, please. Porter-Brook will be televised live on Sky Sports on August 16. Finally: August 16 is the date locked in for Kell Brook's title challenge against American Shawn Porter .","Floyd Mayweather may move world title rematch with Marcos Maidana from Las Vegas to New York City .
If Mayweather were to fight Maidana in New York, he would lose a sizeable chunk of the proceeds from the fight to the IRS ."

"A man living alone on an island like Robinson Crusoe for almost 20 years faces eviction from his castaway oasis. The Australian man has been living on tiny Restoration Island off the north-eastern coast of Australia since 1993 after the former high-flying Sydney businessman lost £6.5 million in the 1987 stock market crash. Living off crabs and coconuts, and connected to solar-powered internet, David Glasheen has enjoyed a life of private tranquillity his dog Quasi, calling himself ‘the luckiest bloke in the world’. Australian Robinson Crusoe: Voluntary castaway David Glasheen has been living as a recluse on a small island off the Australian coast for almost 20 years with his dog Quasi but the island's directors are trying to evict him . But the Queensland government is trying to evict the voluntary castaway, in his sixties, after he failed to build a resort on the 1.53ha island, a condition of the lease which allowed him access to the land. The Queensland Supreme Court recently ruled that the land should be repossessed and that he and his business partners are ‘trespassers’. He told The Daily Telegraph: ‘This judgement is just horrible.’ Living a reclusive life, Glasheen learnt . to be self-sufficient, growing vegetables and brewing his own beer. He . also still trades stocks using an online trading account. He said: ‘You soon learn in the bush to survive. If you don’t you die pretty quickly. ‘It is a fabulous place, I am a lucky bloke to be there. Lonely in love: Using his solar-powered internet connection Glasheen tried internet dating to find his 'Girl Friday' to live with him, using a mannequin to publicise his plight but had no luck . 'Luckiest bloke in the world': Glasheen loves living on the island, catching fish and crabs, growing vegetables and brewing his own beer to survive . Broke island lease: The government has ruled that Glasheen must vacate Restoration Island, a 1.52ha oasis, having failed to build tourist accommodation and fishing facilities, a condition of his lease . 'I have learnt a huge amount. I started to value what is really important. Trust, honesty, respect - simple things. 'I have learnt that you can do things with very little.' While he loves his life in paradise, Glasheen does get lonely and several years ago tried internet dating to find ‘Girl Friday’ to live with him. He got hundreds of responses but had no luck in love. Glasheen said: ‘It gets lonely out here. ‘My only hope is for a mermaid to turn up on the beach.’ A girlfriend had initially moved to the island, 1,500 miles from Queensland capital Brisbane, with Glasheen but found life there too difficult. He is visited occasionally by passing yachtsmen, kayakers and groups of organic farmers. Few visitors: Glasheen says sometimes he gets lonely with his dog his only companion but he is occasionally visited by passing yachtsmen, kayakers and organic farmers . Must vacate: The island's directors have been trying to evict Glasheen since 2000 and he says that he has 'no idea' what he will do if he has to move from the island he has been living on for almost 20 years . Australian oasis: Restoration Island is 1,500 miles from Queensland capital Brisbane and was named because Captain William Bligh found essential supplies were there that had been set adrift by mutineers on HMS Bounty . Glasheen leased one third of the island . from the Australian Government for £13,000 a year on . behalf of Restoration Island Priory Ltd. The 43-year lease which allowed Glasheen required him and a business partner to develop fishing facilities and tourist accommodation valued at a minimum of £131,000 on the island, a condition which they failed to do. A Supreme Court judgement said the island’s directors had been trying to get Glasheen to vacate the island since 2000. The court said: ‘The defendants have wrongly deprived the plaintiff of its asset for over a decade during which time they have enjoyed its benefits. Glasheen is considering appealing the decision. Asked what he will do if he is forced to leave his island home he said: ‘I have no idea. I live on now. Tomorrow I might be dead.’ Restoration Island was named after Captain William Bligh found essential supplies that had been set adrift by mutineers of the HMS Bounty. Survival skills: The picturesque island has taught Glasheen bush survival skills because 'if you don't (learn them) you die pretty quickly' he said .","David Glasheen has been living on Restoration Island off the Australian coast for almost 20 years after he lost £6.5 million on the stock market .

"The remains of a 59-year-old man have been found six miles from a Nevada town after he vanished 18 months ago while looking for help when he and his wife became stranded. Albert Chretien's body was discovered on a mountain near the Nevada-Idaho state line on Saturday by hunters. Mr Chretien and his wife Rita had set out from their home in British Columbia, Canada, to a Las Vegas trade show in March 2011 when they became catastrophically lost. The couple became stuck in a remote area when their GPS system led them on to a back road. While Mr Chretien disappeared trying to find help, his 56-year-old wife was found 48 days later close to death after surviving on trail mix and snow. Scroll down for video . Found: The remains of Albert Chretien, pictured with wife Rita, have been found 18 months after the couple's vehicle became trapped in the Nevada wilderness . Elko County Sheriff's Deputy David Prall said Mr Chretien was within six miles of Mountain City, but his GPS battery likely failed and he began walking too far north, facing uphill into the deepest snow. Prall said that it took a courageous man to make it as far as Mr Chretien did. Authorities said they were able to identify the 59-year-old using the wallet and business cards found on his body. The news offered a measure of relief and closure to his family. 'She's obviously upset but she's also relieved that we recovered Albert's remains,' Detective Jim Carpenter told CBC News. Trapped: The couple's vehicle, pictured, became stuck in some mud after taking a risky trail under the guidance of their GPS system . Landscape: While Mr Chretien was found in an area known for conditions the couple were not prepared for, pictured, he was just six miles from Mountain City . In an email to CBC, Mr Chretien's sister Lorraine Hoving said 'it does open the wound again, however, to the emotions,' but that his family were thankful for the news. 'It appears he went peacefully, which we are so thankful for … Apparently, it snowed hard that night so he must have simply laid down and went to heaven,' Ms Hoving wrote. Lost in the woods: The couple were trying to drive from their home in British Columbia to a Las Vegas trade show when they got stuck . 'We are all holding up fine, we are experiencing a great sense of relief and [are] thankful for closure.' Mr and Mrs Chretien had planned to make a rest stop at the small town of Jackpot on the Nevada border and consulted the navigational system for the quickest route from Oregon. Unfortunately this led them through a treacherous mountain range for which they were woefully ill-equipped. Their ten-year-old Chevrolet only had front-wheel drive and soon became stuck in the mud. Mr Chretien set out on foot after three days to get help. Chad Herman, one of three hunters who found Mrs Chretien, told emergency workers: 'She's about dead, and her husband took off about a month ago and never came back, so I'm sure he's dead.' Mrs Chretien had survived for seven weeks by eating trail mix, boiled sweets and drinking water from a stream. Mr Herman said the 56-year-old was 'really weak' when they found her and that she had draped . colourful blankets from the van's windows to attract attention. A helicopter was sent to airlift Mrs Chretien to hospital in Twin Falls, Idaho, as it was . considered too risky to try to reach her by road. She was released from hospital and returned to her home in British Columbia with her . family for further treatment. One of the couple's three sons, Raymond Chretien, said the family was 'stunned' their mother had been found alive. Location: Hunters discovered the man's remains on Saturday near the Nevada-Idaho line, easily identifying him with his wallet found and body in tact . He said she had lost 20-30lb during her ordeal. Raymond Chretien said: 'I don't believe they were prepared for winter weather. They don't go camping.' A search and rescue team, with 20 . volunteers on horseback and several all-terrain vehicles, continued to cover a wide search area looking for Mr Chretien for the following days to no avail. Sergeant Kevin McKinney, spokesman for the Elko County Sheriff's Office, said the search also involved one plane. The Chretiens were last seen on CCTV on March 19 when they stopped for fuel and supplies . at a petrol station in Oregon. The couple appear to have turned their van off a main road in southern Idaho or . north-eastern Nevada near Mountain City. Desperate words: A note written by Rita Chretien about her ordeal while her van was stuck in the Nevada wilderness . Desperate rescue: Mrs Chretien was discovered 48 days later in the van, pictured, with her son saying she had lost 20-30 pounds in weight . The area in which the Chretiens were traveling is known to be particularly dangerous and inhospitable during the winter months. Bill Landon, who lives in Mountain City, said: 'Them mountains are nasty, some of the gnarliest mountains you ever seen. 'The mud up there is something terrible.You sink up to your knees in it. When it rains back there, those roads turn to plumb mush.' Mel Basanez, a 74-year-old retired . grocery shop owner who has lived in the area all his life, said the . journey that the Canadian couple had attempted was a big risk. He said: 'I can't imagine getting off the highway in this country at that time of year. The minute the guy got off the highway, he should have realised he was in trouble.' By typing Jackpot into the van's GPS, the shortest route leads off the main road and along a network of forest roads labelled only with numbers. Last sighting: Albert Chretien (bottom left) is captured on CCTV making a stop for supplies in Oregon . Sgt McKinney said: 'I'm no expert on GPS devices and how they work, but if you plug in for the shortest distance to any location it'll give you that, but that's not always the best way to go.' Ryan Stowell, who lives in the remote mountain area, said: 'I think that GPS really screwed them up. 'There's no reason for us to be up there, unless we go up there to see if the road is open to Elko.' The couple's pastor said Albert Chretien had recently bought the GPS unit. Revered Neil Allenbrand said: 'They planned to use it basically to get around Las Vegas.' He described Mr Chretien, the owner of an excavating business, as 'a bit of an adventurer at times'. Family's response: Members of the Chretien family spoke about their ordeal at St Luke's Hospital, in Idaho last year, pictured, while this weekend they described the news of their father as tragic but relieving . Blindly following GPS units has led several drivers into life-threatening situations in the past. In December 2009, a couple from Nevada were stranded for three days in the Oregon desert after they followed directions from a navigation device. The following January, an Oregon couple spent 12 hours stranded in the Cascade Mountains near Washington with their 11-month-old daughter. Mike Ferguson, author of guidebook GPS Land Navigation, said many inexperienced travellers put too much trust in devices and don't use their common sense. Mr Ferguson said: 'Unless you're prepared for it, with a four-wheel drive, or maybe a snow machine in winter, when it sends you off into remote terrain, it can surely get you into big trouble.'

"Confession: Labour MP Tristram Hunt has admitted he might send his three children to private schools . Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt has admitted he might send his children to private schools. The Labour MP has a five-year-old son, Digby, who goes to a primary school in London. He also has two younger daughters who he suggested could go to the same school. But asked if he would pay for them to attend independent schools, he said: ‘As a parent you can never rule out whatever takes place but we are delighted with the education he’s [Digby’s] having.’ The TV historian turned MP, the son of Lord Hunt of Chesterton, benefited from a public school education himself. He was educated at £15,465-a-year University College School in Hampstead, north London. It is part of the Eton Group, which comprises 12 of the most elite independent schools in the country. And he would not be the first Labour MP whose commitment to the Party’s philosophy of equality and egalitarianism is open to question when it comes to educating their children. Tony Blair and Harriet Harman both send their children to the selective London Oratory School. And ardent Left-winger Diane Abbott - who had criticised the way her colleagues educated their children - enrolled her son, James, at the prestigious private City of London School. Privately educated: Hunt was educated at £15,465-a-year University College School (pictured) in Hampstead . Details emerged in 2003, a month after she spoke out about the public deserving ‘education on the basis of merit, not ability to pay’. Tory MP Peter Bone yesterday said Labour MPs had a tendency to ‘say one thing and do another’. He added: ‘I think he [Hunt] should send his children to the best school for them - if that’s a private school that’s absolutely the right thing to do. ‘But then it’s a little worrying when they lecture us about where to send our children to school.’ Barnaby Lenon, the chairman of the Independent Schools Council, said: ‘We’re delighted that the shadow secretary for education is thinking of sending his children to an independent school.’ Uncommitted? Tony Blair and Harriet Harman both send their children to the selective London Oratory School . Mr Hunt’s comment, in the Daily Mirror, raises the prospect of his children being taught by unqualified teachers - despite Labour’s policy that full-time teachers in state-funded schools must be fully qualified. He said: ‘We are not going to come in and sack teachers but we are going to say they have to work towards qualified teacher status or they have to go.’ He also suggested Labour could bring back Education Maintenance Allowances for 16-18-year-olds, which were cancelled in England by the Coalition amid claims they were being used as ‘beer money’. Their reinstatement could be paid for by axing wealthy pensioners of the winter fuel allowance. The 39-year-old, who studied history at Trinity College, Cambridge, presented several television documentaries and wrote a number of books before being elected as the MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central in 2010. But he slipped up when asked the date of the Battle of Crecy, where Edward III defeated the French. He suggested 1419 but admitted he was ‘probably wildly out’. The actual date was 1346.","The Labour MP has a five-year-old son Digby and two younger daughters .

"Holidaymakers watched in horror yesterday as five crewmen were killed in an accident on a luxury Thomson cruise liner. During a stopover for a festival in the Canary Islands, eight crew were checking a lifeboat when its ropes snapped and it suddenly plunged 65ft from the upper deck into the sea. The lifeboat is said to have overturned as it hit the water, trapping most of them underneath. Were you a passenger on the cruise ship? Email Paul.Bentley@dailymail.co.uk . Scroll down for video . Upturned: A lifeboat remains in the sea after falling from a cruise liner called 'Valleta' and killing five people during a safety drill while it was docked at La Palma in the Canary Islands . Close-up: Four people are believed to have died before they could be rescued and a fifth man passed away later . Aftermath: A rescue boat is moored by the capsized lifeboat following the tragedy . Tragic incident: A rescue helicopter is seen next to the Thomson Majesty cruise ship at the Santa Cruz pier . Three were taken to hospital, but five . crewmen – three Indonesians, a Filipino and a Ghanaian – drowned as . shipmates desperately fought to rescue them. Last night, Thomson Cruises said it . was investigating the accident aboard the Thomson Majesty, which only . made its first sailing for the firm last summer. The luxury ship, which carries 1,462 . passengers and has 17 spa rooms, two swimming pools and five . restaurants, had arrived at Santa Cruz on the island of La Palma three . hours earlier for a six-hour stop en route to Madeira. At just before midday, with many . passengers on shore enjoying carnival celebrations, the crew began to . lower the lifeboat as part of a drill that was made compulsory for . cruise liners at every stop following the Costa Concordia tragedy. But witnesses said that during the . safety exercise, one of the lifeboat hoist cables snapped, briefly . causing the boat to hang vertically with the eight crew on board. Seconds later, the other cable snapped under the strain, sending the boat plummeting six decks towards the water. Rescue workers: The five people killed were crew of the Thompson Majesty, operated by Thomson Cruises . Concern: The local harbourmaster said the early indications were that the lifeboat had plunged into the water after a mechanical failure . Location: The Thomson Majesty liner had arrived in the port of the island of La Palma (pictured) just three hours earlier from Gran Canaria for a six-hour stopover en route to Funchal, Madeira . The Thomson Majesty - a nine-deck boat measuring 679ft by 92ft with a speed of 19 knots - has five restaurants, five bars, two lounges, a casino, two swimming pools, a library and fitness centre. It . can carry up to 1,462 passengers along with 600 staff. A . seven-night cruise of the Canary Islands on the boat, leaving in . February or March, costs £600 per person for a two-person cabin online, including return flights from London to Tenerife. The survivors, two aged 30 and one . aged 32, managed to jump away before it hit the water. Two, both Greeks, . are said to be seriously injured and are being treated at a local . hospital. The third, a Filipino, has been discharged. The others were trapped as they . entered the water. Four of them were dead by the time their bodies were . recovered, while the other crewman died a short time later. Last night, the small, white, . two-hulled lifeboat could be seen capsized beside the ship. The Foreign . Office said it was ‘urgently investigating’ the incident. Last night a former passenger raised doubts about the safety drill. Retired entrepreneur Terry Dobbins, 75, from Bournemouth, was on the ship last week and watched the ‘shambolic’ safety exercise. He added: ‘The lifeboat was coming . half way down, then lurching to a halt. They were bouncing in mid air. The winches were seizing up. It was really worrying. ‘I’m not sure if I would go back. Our lives are in their hands.’ The 40,876-ton Majesty, which has a . crew of 600, sails around the Greek islands in the summer before taking . passengers on winter sun cruises to the Canaries, Madeira, Morocco and . Tenerife. The 20-year-old ship is managed on Thomson’s behalf by a . company called Louis Cruises. It is the second tragedy to strike the . ship since it entered service in 1992. In March 2010, two passengers . were killed when the liner, then called the Louis Majesty, was struck by . a giant wave in the Mediterranean. Last night Thomson said: ‘There was an . incident involving the ship’s crew during a safety drill. Our thoughts . are with the families of those involved. ‘We are working closely with the ship owners and managers, Louis Cruises, to determine exactly what has happened. ‘We are also working closely with all relevant authorities and will be co-operating fully with their investigations.’","Thomson Majesty liner had arrived at La Palma port just three hours earlier .

Jack Schaap, 54, had been pastor of the First Baptist Church of Hammond in Indiana for 11 years, but was let go in July after a deacon saw a text on his phone from the teenager, allegedly with a picture of the two of them kissing. He pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in September to transporting a minor across state lines for sexual relations. Dismissed: Dr Jack Schaap, who was the pastor of First Baptist Church in Hammond for more than a decade, was let go in August . Big city: Shaap's wife, Cindy, second left, is the daughter of famed Baptist Rev Jack Hyles; here, they're pictured in front of Chicago's Buckingham Fountain . Caught: A deacon of First Baptist Church saw a picture on Schaap's phone from a teenage girl; the picture allegedly showed the two kissing . In a new court filing, he says he was stressed out and depressed at the time that the month-long relationship started. Donations to his church were down and . he said he had to lay off employees and was working up to 100 hours a . week, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Schaap met the victim through that extra work, which included counseling students at First Baptist's schools, he said. The court filing, which is to be . considered with his sentencing, included 140 letters of support from . family and church members. 'We were known for our happy marriage, and it was not a hypocrisy; it was real,' Jack Schaap’s wife, Cindy, said in a letter. In the September plea agreement, Schaap admitted that he . had sex with the girl, who turned 17 a week after the relationship started. He also admitted that he used a computer to persuade the girl to have sex with him . illegally. The relationship lasted from June 1, 2012 to July 30, 2012, during which he traveled with her from Indiana to Illinois to Michigan, 'with the intent . that she engage in sexual activity', according to the Chicago Tribune. The legal age of consent in the state of Indiana is 16, the lowest age allowed in any state. Schapp's wife, Cindy, is the daughter of the late founder of the church, Rev. Jack Hyles. Long-running: Schaap, pictured preaching from the church's pulpit, had been pastor there since 2001, but was dismissed after a vote from the deacons . Place of worship: The First Baptist Church is located in Hammond, Indiana, and is partially housed in the old federal court building; its auditorium sits 7,500 . Roots: Schaap, pictured left, is married to Cindy Schaap, the daughter of the late Rev Jack Hyles, right, who founded the First Baptist Church in Hammond . Mega-churches are houses of worship with 2,000 or more members and weekly attendees. They have grown in popularity in recent years, and are mostly a phenomenon of modern times. According to the Hartford Institute for Religion Research, most current mega-churches were founded after 1955 after larger churches started to become more appealing to many church-goers. Many focus on ‘seeker services,’ which often offer little deep theology and instead appeal to sceptics and non-believers. They are also aimed at targeting younger audiences, often with the prospects of contemporary music and more casual settings than traditional churches. The denominations involved include Baptists, Methodists, and Nondenominational, as well as some Pentecostal churches. Jack Schapp's published books include Marriage: The Divine Intimacy and Dating . with a Purpose: Common Sense Dating Principles for Couples, Parents, and . Youth Workers. The pastor has received his fair share of criticism over the years due to some of his more controversial teachings. Last . year, he was chastised for his views on women, believing them to be an . inferior species and saying husbands should take charge of their wives . and blasted Eve as being the sinner. He . also said it would be a 'cold day in hell before I get my theology from . a woman', adding: 'Your soul is going to hell because of what Eve did.' Typically, mega-churches have more . than 2,000 members or regular attendees, with several areas to listen to . sermons, often with one or more pastors speaking during a Sunday . service. Many of them feature contemporary worship styles, with live music complete with worship band, and sometimes even an orchestra pit. Mega-churches have also received a fair amount of criticism, as some say they focus more on entertainment than on worship, and that large numbers detract the amount of time pastors can spend with the congregation. First Baptist is housed in the old federal courthouse building in Hammond, Indiana, and contains an auditorium that seats 7,500. More than 15,000 people attend services on the weekend.","Jack Schaap, 54, has been pastor at First Baptist Church of Hammond in Indiana for 11 years .

"Not even the godfearing could escape the wrath of the storm. The Bishop of Bath and Wells was tucked up in his four-poster bed when the wind blew in the roof of his episcopal palace. He tried to flee but it was too late. The chimney stacks came crashing down, plunging bishop and wife through the floor, burying both in the rubble. He was found, it was reported, ‘with his brains dash’d out’ while she had wrapped herself in the sheets out of sheer terror and suffocated. They were the most eminent victims of the most catastrophic and destructive storm ever recorded as hitting the shores of Britain. The Great Storm of 1703 caused devastation in just one 24 hour spell . Gale force winds whip up the sea around Seaham Habour lighthouse, in County Durham yesterday. Storms and heavy downpours wreaked fresh havoc across Britain causing damage, delays and injuries . The country has trembled this week, rocked by 100mph-plus winds which caused injuries and two reported deaths, but these were relatively endurable conditions compared with the tiger of all tempests, the Great Storm of 1703. The author Daniel Defoe put the death toll of the storm at around 8,000 . It is often overlooked. Historians acknowledge the bad weather that almost stopped William the Conqueror in 1066 and the ‘protestant wind’ saw off the Spanish Armada in 1588. The epic snow-bound winter of 1947 and the forest- felling ‘hurricane’ of 1987 have both passed into legend. But the daddy of all these disasters — the one against which this week’s heavy winds can justifiably be measured — was three centuries ago, in the reign of Queen Anne. As an area of low-pressure tracked its way across the centre of the country on the Friday night and Saturday morning of November 26/27, 8,000 lives were lost, a large swathe of the Royal Navy was wiped out and the Eddystone lighthouse off Plymouth was obliterated. ‘Never was such a storm of wind, such a hurricane and tempest known in the memory of man,’ wrote a chronicler of the times, ‘nor the like to be found in the histories of England.’ Gusts in the English Channel topped 140mph. So fierce was the wind that a ship torn from its moorings in the Helford River in Cornwall was blown helplessly, its cowering crew still on board as mountainous seas tossed it, for 200 miles before grounding on the Isle of Wight eight hours later. Its mast smashed, a ship lies wrecked on the coast. The Royal Navy lost 14 warships and 1,500 crew in the storm . The low pressure system causing all this was astonishing. Daniel Defoe, writer and political commentator (and later the renowned author of Robinson Crusoe) could not believe how low the mercury in his barometer had sunk, and suspected at first that his children had been messing about with the instrument. What was actually taking place was what historian Martin Brayne terms ‘the most terrifying and catastrophic storm this island has ever known’. The hurricane-force winds caused havoc on land. Trees were uprooted and reduced to mere matchwood. Hundreds of the windmills that dotted the landscape were destroyed and at least one burst into flames from the friction as the sails whizzed round at extraordinary speed — an uncanny precursor of the modern- day wind turbine that caught fire at Ardrossan in Scotland during high winds last month. Church spires — which a combination of religious piety and architectural technology had been making ever higher — toppled. A curate in Kent was distraught to see his landmark spire, close to 200ft and the tallest in the county, dashed to the ground. Lead was stripped from roofs, simply rolled up like scrolls by the unstoppable force of the wind. Tons of it were torn from the roof of Queen’s College, Oxford, and then sent hurtling through the window of the church opposite. Gusts in the English Channel topped an incredible 140mph . At Cambridge, pinnacles were blown from the top of King’s College Chapel. Gloucester, Ely and Bristol cathedrals took batterings, and the godly were convinced that the biblical proportions of what was happening meant Judgment Day was upon them. Homes were just as vulnerable,with falling chimneys a widespread hazard. A moralising chronicler recounted the tragic tale of a child asleep in a cradle a foot from its parents’ bed. ‘The fall of a chimney beat out the infant’s brains and mashed the whole body, in the father’s and mother’s sight. ‘From whence we may observe that, in a general calamity innocency suffers with the guilty, and the poor babe is destroyed with a stroke of divine vengeance while the sinful parents are permitted to stretch out their lives.’ There was a near miss for the Royal Family. At St James’s Palace, Queen Anne and her husband, Prince George, fled from their rooms just minutes before a chimney stack crashed in. As she then stood at a window and watched the trees in the park being torn apart, a garden wall fell. ‘Many houses demolished, many people killed,’ noted the London-based diarist John Evelyn. Then, when he managed to get to his country house in Kent, he was depressed by the sight of thousands of ‘goodly oaks lying in ghastly postures, like regiments fallen in battle’. It was the British Isles coastline which saw the worst of the storm, with 1,200 people dying on the Goodwin sand bank in the English Channel . He took it all as divine retribution ‘for our national sins, and my own’. Around the British coast, there were serious problems with flooding as high tides, whipped up by the wind, surged over inadequate sea defences. Both sides of the Severn estuary were awash. But it was at sea — the essential highway of an expanding maritime nation — that the havoc was greatest. Dozens of the hundreds of colliers plying the east coast with Tyneside coal for London simply disappeared after trying to ride out the storm at anchor. Cables snapped in the heaving seas and they were gone. Further south, the Solent was dotted with wrecks. On one of these, the Newcastle, a 50-gun naval man-of-war, 197 of the 233 crew drowned. Those ships that survived did so because their crews not only hauled down all sails but took axes and hacked down the masts and rigging to deck level to give themselves any chance of staying upright. One captain of a warship that was escorting 130 merchant ships towards Ireland ordered his fleet to take refuge in Milford Haven, West Wales, when the storm was at its height. He recorded ‘the dismal sight of ships, some without masts, some sunk and others upon the rocks. The wind was blowing so hard, with thunder, lightning and rain, that a man could not stand on deck. Nigh on 30 merchant ships are lost.’ There were tales of enormous courage and luck, such as the sailor who was washed off one sinking ship by a mighty wave and deposited on the quarterdeck of another, which managed to stay afloat. BUT there were also examples of gross inhumanity. This image shows a flash of lightning striking what appears to be a lighthouse. Many believed the storm was divine retribution . In the English Channel, numerous ships were blown onto the treacherous Goodwin Sands, a sandbank in the English Channel, and stayed there until the tide washed over them and drowned their crews as they hung upon the broken masts and rigging. The Kent mainland was just six miles away but folk there did little to help save lives. Instead, these ‘cannibals’ and ‘monsters’, as an angry Defoe termed them, waited until the sea had claimed the marooned men before moving in to scavenge what they could from the wrecks and the bodies. ‘Boats came very near the stranded men in quest of booty and plunder, but nobody concerned themselves for the lives of these miserable creatures,’ Defoe wrote in The Storm, a chronicle of the ‘dreadful tempest’ which he published the following year. Close to 1,200 lives were lost on the treacherous Goodwin sand bank. The most spectacular casualty of the storm was one of the recent wonders of the age — the newlybuilt Eddystone lighthouse, a warning beacon on a dangerous reef in the middle of the sea 14 miles south of Plymouth. It had been completed just five years earlier as the result of the mad-inventor  determination and engineering skill of one Henry Winstanley. It had taken two years to build, its stone base secured to the wave-tossed and frequently unreachable rock by a dozen 12-ft iron rods. Winstanley was convinced it could stand up to anything that Nature could throw at it. So confident, in fact, that, as the storm began to brew on the morning of November 26, he hitched what turned out to be a suicidal ride on a supply ship to go there and experience for himself how his brainchild would defy the elements. It didn’t. Winstanley died inside his own creation as, battered by 60ft waves and whipped by incredible winds, the wooden superstructure cracked and it crumbled into the sea. As for the storm, it blew away as quickly as it had come, roaring across to the European mainland before petering out. Back in Britain, the country was left to count the cost. The Navy had lost 14 of its principal fighting ships and 1,500 crew. Defoe put the total loss of life at around 8,000. But if true, it was a huge slice out of a small nation. Britain’s population was just five million. It was as if, today, 100,000 people had in a single day and night been slaughtered. And the cause of all this mayhem? At the time, the almost universally accepted explanation was that this was the hand of God at work, handing out divine retribution. ‘I pray that we may all repent’, wrote one sea captain, who had survived the onslaught, ‘for doubtless this was a warning against us of God’s anger.’ From a 21st-century viewpoint, the tempest of 1703 has a different explanation — as the sort of exceptional climatic event that occurs perhaps once every 500 years. At the very least, it puts this week’s stormy weather in perspective. It could, indeed, have been a lot worse.","8,000 lives were lost, a large swathe of the Royal Navy was wiped out and the Eddystone lighthouse off Plymouth was obliterated .

"Luis Suarez is yet to apologise for his bite on Giorgio Chiellini – but if one does arrive then expect it to include justification for his actions. For the Uruguayan – twice guilty of sinking his teeth into an opponent – is yet to master the art of a sincere sorry. In 2010, following his bite on PSV's Otman Bakkal while playing for Ajax in the Eredivise – for which he received a seven-game ban - Suarez’s apology attempted to explain the indiscretion. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez: These things happen - I collided with his shoulder . Shocking: Luis Suarez appeared to bite Girogio Chiellini's shoulder during Uruguay's win over Italy on Wednesday at the FIFA World Cup in Brazil . Painful: Suarez holds his teeth in pain while Chiellini rolls around the floor in agony following the incident . Previous: Luis Suarez received a seven game ban for biting PSV's Otman Bakkal while playing for Ajax in 2010 . Ouch! Otman Bakkal shows the bite marks to a PSV teammate after the incident in April 2010 . ‘In those moments you can only feel your heart beating strong, you are not able to think about what you are going to do and after you just feel bad and regret,’ he said. Three years later and in the wake of his attack on Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic, the Liverpool striker questioned the length of the 10-game ban served upon him. ‘I would like to explain to everybody that I decided to accept the ban because – while 10 games is clearly greater than those bans given in past cases where players have actually been seriously injured – I acknowledge that my actions were not acceptable on the football pitch,’ he said in a statement. Controversy: Suarez (top left) is captured biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013 . Handy: Suarez's deliberate handball versus Ghana at the 2010 World Cup helped Uruguay reach the semi-final . Confrontation: Suarez was found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra in 2011 . VIDEO Suarez hands Liverpool problem . In 2011, Suarez received an eight-game suspension and was fined £40,000 for racially abusing Manchester United’s Patrice Evra having called him a ‘negro’ during a match at Anfield. Again, though, his apology was far from contrite. ‘I admitted to the commission that I said a word in Spanish once, and only once,’ he explained. ‘I never, ever used this word in a derogatory way and if it offends anyone then I want to apologise for that.’ He was also forced to issue an apology when he refused to shake hands with Evra in the corresponding fixture at Old Trafford. Meanwhile, at the 2010 World Cup when he was red carded for handling on the line to deny Ghana a winning goal, Suarez later admitted he would do the same again after Uruguay went on to win the quarter-final tie. And Suarez’s latest reaction is to play down the incident with Italy defender Chiellini, which occurred during the closing stages of Uruguay's 1-0 victory on Tuesday, a win which sends them into the second round. The 27-year-old said: ‘These situations happen on the field. 'I had contact with his shoulder, nothing more, things like that happen all the time.’ FIFA have confirmed they have opened disciplinary proceedings against Suarez and the player and Uruguay have until 9pm on Wednesday to provide evidence. If Suarez is found guilty of biting Chiellini, however, then expect his apology to be delivered through gritted teeth. Following his bite on PSV's Otman Bakkal in 2010... ‘I feel very sorry about what happened to me against PSV. ‘I apologise to Bakkal and to all Ajax supporters. ‘Being the captain, I am aware I didn’t make the right decision. ‘I did something wrong. In those moments you can only feel your heart beating strong, you are not able to think about what you are going to do and after you just feel bad and regret. ‘I am very self-critical and I do know I’m not like that.’ Following the ruling that he had racially abused Patrice Evra in 2011... ‘I admitted to the commission that I said a word (negro) in Spanish once, and only once. ‘I never, ever used this word in a derogatory way and if it offends anyone then I want to apologise for that. ‘I told the panel members that I will not use it again on a football pitch in England.’ Following his refusal to shake hands with Evra in 2012... 'I have spoken with the manager (Kenny Dalglish) since the game at Old Trafford and I realise I got things wrong. 'I have not only let (Dalglish) down but also the club and what it stands for and I'm sorry. I made a mistake and I regret what happened. 'I should have shaken Patrice Evra's hand before the game and I want to apologise for my actions. I would like to put this whole issue behind me and concentrate on playing football.' Following his bite on Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic in 2013... ‘I am truly very sorry about the incident with Branislav Ivanovic. ‘I hope that all the people who I offended at Anfield last Sunday will grant me forgiveness and I again repeat my apology to Branislav. I would like to explain to everybody that I decided to accept the ban because – while 10 games is clearly greater than those bans given in past cases where players have actually been seriously injured – I acknowledge that my actions were not acceptable on the football pitch. ‘So I do not want to give the wrong impression to people by making an appeal.’","Suarez appeared to bite Italy defender Chiellini during Uruguay's 1-0 win over Italy .

"A mother-of-three was sacked from her new job in a department store cafe after customers complained about her tattoo. Joanne Stronach, 39, who has the positive mantra 'everything happens for a reason' inked on her arm, was just three weeks into a six-month trial in the coffee lounge at Wetherells in Selby, North Yorkshire, when she was told she was unsuitable for the position. Ms Stronach said she was left 'angry' and 'humiliated' after bosses told her her body art - a celebration of her three children - would offend older patrons at the traditional department store. Complaints: Mother-of-three Joanne Stronach, lost her job at a Yorkshire department store after customers complained about her 'everything happens for a reason' tattoo .

Ms Stronach, who has worked in catering and pubs all her life, explained: 'They said I didn't fit in with the image of Wetherells and the older customers don't like tattoos. 'They are all old folks, they are fuddy duddies and they act like its Mr Selfridge. They should just get over it and get in the real world. I was just shocked. They wouldn't even let me wear long sleeves because they said it was unhygienic, even though I wore them until they got me a uniform. 'I was in long sleeves for the first two weeks and then I got my short sleeve shirt in the third week and that's when it all happened. 'I went there to do a job, which I did well as I always do I told the boss of the kitchen, who said it wouldn't matter as long as they are not offensive.

Ms Stronach, from Selby, said she had been thrilled to land the job as cafe assistant in Wetherells, which was established in 1898, because she has been going there all her life. 'I . have got new job starting in two weeks as a carer and the first thing I . asked was will my tattoos be a problem and they aren't of course,' she said. The proud mother said her tattoos of hearts, butterflies and stars were her way of celebrating her children Reece, 15, Charlie, 13 and Lacey, four. Ms Stronach said the words 'Believe everything happens for a reason... just believe' on her arm were especially personal. 'Its a very personal one that means everything I do is because of my love for my children,' she said. 'The . tattoos were all done by Steve Dagg in Selby. One features my . daughter's name, Lacey, with a heart, and 'Love' with two hearts and on . my other arm, it says 'Everything happens for a reason' with . butterflies. 'I was even told by one customer that she liked my butterfly. 'I know so many people who shop there as I've worked around town for 13 years.

"The founder of file-sharing website Megaupload was today remanded in custody after denying charges of internet piracy and money laundering. Kim Dotcom - nicknamed 'Dr Evil' - a German national, smiled and waved to around 20 supporters in court before being denied bail. Prosecutor Anne Toohey argued at the bail . hearing, in Auckland, New Zealand, that Dotcom, also known as Kim Schmitz, . was a flight risk 'at the extreme end of the scale' because it was . believed he had access to funds, had multiple identities and had a . history of fleeing criminal charges. But his defence lawyer said the former hacker, who is reportedly 6ft 6in tall and weighs more than 20 stone (285lbs), was hardly likely to escape detection by New Zealand immigration. 'He . is not the sort of person who will pass unnoticed through our customs . and immigration lines and controls,' said lawyer, Paul Davison. Scroll down for video . Denied: Megaupload boss Kim Dotcom (right) was denied bail during a hearing in Auckland, New Zealand today . Distinctive: Dotcom's defence lawyer argued that at 6ft 6in and weighing more than 20 stone (285lbs) the former hacker was unlikely to pass unnoticed through customs and immigration . He added that his client had cooperated fully, his passports had been seized and his funds . frozen. U.S. authorities want to extradite Dotcom, 38, in what they say is one of the biggest criminal copyright theft cases ever brought.

Fans: Speaking to his supporters inside court Dotcom said: 'Hey guys thanks for turning up, I appreciate it.' He also wished a female supporter a 'happy birthday' Defiant: Dotcom's defence lawyer, Paul Davison, said his client was 'realistic about what is happening' but was hopeful about the outcome of the judge's bail decision expected later this week . Judge David McNaughton said the bail . application was too complicated for an immediate ruling, adding he would . issue a written decision no later than Wednesday. Dotcom and three others, were arrested on Friday after New Zealand police raided his £16million  country estate at the request of the FBI. Police . had to cut Dotcom out of a safe room he had barricaded himself in, . because, according to his layer, he was frightened and panicked. In total seven MegaUpload executives – including two other Germans and a . Dutchman also seized in New Zealand – have each been charged with five counts . of racketeering, copyright infringement and conspiracy, and could be . jailed for up to 20 years. Presenting Dotcom's case for flight . risk, prosecutor Toohey said 45 credit cards in three wallets were found . in the mansion under Dotcom's various names, while three passports were . also found. But his defence lawyer said: 'My client collects them (credit cards), most of them are out of date.' After the judge's decision Dotcom took time to talk to his supporters. 'Hey guys thanks for turning up, I appreciate it,' he said, wishing a female supporter a 'happy birthday'.

'cyberlocker', in which users can upload and transfer files that are too . large to send by email. Such sites can have perfectly legitimate uses. But the MPAA, which has campaigned for a crackdown on piracy, alleged that the vast majority of content being shared on MegaUpload was in violation of copyright laws. The website allowed users to download films, TV shows, games, music and other content for free, but made money by charging subscriptions to people who wanted access to faster download speeds or extra content. The website also sold advertising. Although music stars such as Kanye West . and Alicia Keys have supported MegaUpload, film and record companies say . the seven-year-old file-sharing site is making a fortune off their work . without paying them a penny. According to the indictment, MegaUpload was estimated at one point to be the 13th most frequently visited website on the Internet.Current estimates by companies that monitor Web traffic place it in the top 100. The five-count indictment, which alleges copyright infringement as well as conspiracy to commit money laundering and racketeering, described a site designed specifically to reward users who uploaded pirated content for sharing.For instance, users received cash bonuses if they uploaded content popular enough to generate massive numbers of downloads, according to the indictment. Such content was almost always copyright protected, the indictment said. 'Fast cars, hot girls, superyachts . and amazing parties. Decadence rules,' said the commentary accompanying . the so-called fun documentary, which Dotcom dedicated to 'all my . fans'. The FBI estimates that Dotcom personally made around $115,000 ($121,000, £77,700) a day during 2010 from his empire. The list of property to be seized, . includes nearly 20 luxury cars, one of them a pink Cadillac, works of . art, and NZ$10million ($10.5million, £6.7million) invested in local finance companies. Dotcom's New Zealand lawyer Davison said . in court that Megaupload's business was being misrepresented and . authorities were being aggressive to add drama to the . case. 'His business did not reproduce or copy material as alleged,' he told . the court, adding that copyright holders had been given access to . Megaupload to identify improper posting of material. He likened the site . to the popular YouTube video site, where people 'promoted their . creativity'. Prosecutor Toohey said two other men sought on global warrants for involvement in Megaupload had been arrested in Europe. In New Zealand, questions are being asked about how Dotcom, who moved to . the country in 2010, could be given permanent residency under a . business investor scheme despite criminal convictions for insider . trading. The shockwaves of the case appeared to be spreading among rival websites . offering lucrative file-sharing. FileSonic, a website providing online . data storage, said in a statement on its website that it had halted its . file-sharing services. Dotcom's case is being heard as the debate over online piracy reaches fever pitch in Washington, where Congress is trying to craft tougher legislation. Lawmakers stopped anti-piracy legislation on Friday, postponing a critical vote in a victory for Internet companies that staged a mass online protest against the fast-moving bills. The movie and music industries want Congress to crack down on Internet piracy and content theft, but major Internet companies such as Google and Facebook have complained that current drafts of the legislation would lead to censorship. Critics of the U.S. Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, and Protect IP Act (PIPA), quickly showed their opposition to the shutdown of Megaupload.com, with hackers attacking the public websites of the Justice Department, the world's largest music company Universal Music, and the two big trade groups that represent the music and film industries.","Denied bail because of access to funds and authorities believe he has multiple IDs .

"Ipswich defender Aaron Cresswell is undergoing a medical ahead of a potential move to West Ham. The 24-year-old left-back has emerged as favourite to join the Hammers as manager Sam Allardyce looks to boost his defensive options, with a move for Norwich’s Martin Olsson now believed to be dead in the water. Cresswell has impressed in recent years at Portman Road, missing just four league games over the course of the last two seasons for the Sky Bet Championship club. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch West Ham unveil Teddy Sheringham and their new kit . Highly rated: Cresswell had been attracting interest from several Premier League clubs . Having started his career at Tranmere, Cresswell moved to Ipswich in 2011 and now looks set to complete a move to West Ham and experience Barclays Premier League football for the first time in his career. The news comes on the day West Ham’s current crop returned for pre-season training, where Allardyce posed for pictures with his two summer recruits to date - striker Mauro Zarate and defensive midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate. Recognition: Cresswell was named in the Championship Team of the Year . Having finished 13th in the league last season, Allardyce has been assured of his position by club owners David Sullivan and David Gold after a minority of Hammers fans began to vent their frustrations at the perceived negative tactics of the former Bolton and Newcastle boss. With 14 clean sheets in the Premier League, West Ham’s survival was based on a sound defensive unit but Allardyce has been keen to add to his numbers at the back, with Cresswell likely to become his third addition ahead of the forthcoming campaign.","Highly-rated defender is closing in on move to Upton Park .

"A secondary school has outraged parents after introducing a 'tinkle pass' which allows students out of lessons to use the toilet just once a week. The cards are issued to students at Castle Vale Performing Arts College in Birmingham every Monday morning. If students don't use them, they must hand them in on a Friday afternoon to ensure they aren't carried forward to the next week. Anger: Castle Vale Performing Arts College has outraged parents after introducing a 'tinkle pass' which allows students out of lessons to use the toilet just once a week . The specially designed 'tinkle card' reads: 'I am missing a super learning opportunity because I need a tinkle.' New headmistress at the school, Charlotte Blencowe, is responsible for the introduction of the cards after introducing a series of new strict policies after taking over during the summer. Students have also been told they can only communicate in class via a series of hand-signals. These include 'Fingers to eyes and then to the board = I can't see', 'To hands clasped in the air = I need a new book or paper' and '3 fingers in the air = I need the toilet.' Pupils have also been told that their bags would be searched to ensure their mobile phones are switched off and to check that they have the required number of pens and pencils. Ideas: New headmistress at the school, Charlotte Blencowe, pictured, is responsible for the introduction of the cards after introducing a series of new strict policies since taking over during the summer . The new rules come after parents staged . an angry protest outside the college on Thursday after 40 students were . sent home for wearing the wrong shoes. Police were called when crowds of . parents gathered outside the gates, furious that their children had been . turned away for breaching a tough new uniform code. Eggs were thrown at the teachers during the protest. Teresa Doyle's children, Ellie, 13, and Connoe, 15, attend the school. She said: 'It's a secondary school but they're treating it more like a nursery with all these hand signals and ""tinkle cards"".' 'My kids are saying to me, ""Mum, we're not at school, we're at a prison"".' 'They're not allowed to talk in class at all and must do everything by these bizarre hand signals.' Mrs Doyle said all pupils were allowed into school yesterday even though many still 'broke' the new uniform rules. She said: 'There were crowds of parents in reception complaining, but no-one's yet managed to talk to the headteacher. 'One parent spotted the headteacher in the corridor and tried to speak to her but she refused. 'She told one of the other teachers to speak to him and then turned her back on him.' Miss Blencoe, who reportedly once dated the son of Chuckle Brothers star Barry Elliot, has refused to comment on the allegations. Another parent said: 'It's ridiculous because what happens if the child needs to use the toilet during class more than once a week? Fury: Police were called to the school on Thursday when crowds of parents gathered outside the gates, furious that their children had been turned away for breaching a tough new uniform code . Trouble: Parents and pupils staged an angry protest outside the college on Thursday after 40 students were sent home for wearing the wrong shoes . 'What are they supposed to do - wet themselves?' The only communication given to parents has been via deputy headteacher, Mark Riggall. Parents yesterday received a text message telling them to go to the school website and download a letter written by Mr Riggall. It reads: 'I would officially like to thank everybody who has worked hard to make the day today such a success. Not happy: Connor Simons, 12, whose mother Wendy had to go to Asda and buy him a pair of shoes for £25 . 'The atmosphere inside school was calm and focused, allowing all students to engage their learning in a positive way.' The letter goes on to list the types of shows which are acceptable, with Mr Riggall saying he needed to 'clear up some issues' from the first day of term. The letter then states that students wearing the appropriate shoes would be allowed into lessons, whilst those who are not 'will be held in the main hall until the correct footwear is brought into school.'","Castle Vale Performing Arts College issues the cards every Monday morning .

"A massively wealthy arms dealer with close links to Britain claims that he can provide proof that Nicolas Sarkozy received millions in illegal cash from Colonel Gaddafi, it emerged today. Ziad Takieddine, 62, insists that the former Libyan dictator funded the former French president’s election campaign in 2007. Takieddine was interviewed by Paris judge Renaud Van Ruymbeke on December 19 and said the majority of the money was paid between ‘December 2006 and January 2007’, five months before Sarkozy came to power. Greeting: Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, right, being welcomed by then French President Nicolas Sarkozy, left, at Elysee Palace in Paris, France. It has been claimed that Sarkozy received millions in illegal cash from Gaddafi . Promising that ‘I can supply you’ with the paperwork, Takieddine said he wanted a ‘new enquiry’ into the scandal. Takieddine’s explosive testament follows similar claims from other witnesses, all of whom insist that Sarkozy was a corrupt head of state. French law bans candidates from receiving cash payments above £6,300, but it is claimed that Gaddafi’s donations were laundered through bank accounts in Panama and Switzerland. An Arabic language document made public last year refers to Gaddafi approving an 'agreement in principle to support the campaign for the candidate for the presidential elections, Nicolas Sarkozy, for a sum equivalent to 50 million euros (£40 million)'. A bundle of incriminating evidence was leaked by senior members of the National Transitional Council, the organisation which governed Libya after the Arab Spring revolution. The money was then allegedly distributed through Takieddine, who was acting as a middle man between Arab despots and French politicians. Gaddafi's son, Saif-Al Islam Gaddafi, also insists that Libya financed Sarkozy's election. Friends: Colonel Gaddafi, left, was referred to as brother leader by then French President Nicolas Sarkozy, right, when the pair met in 2007 . Saif-Al Islam, who is now awaiting trial, said: 'Sarkozy must first give back the money he took from Libya to finance his electoral campaign. We funded it.’ Eyebrows were first raised when Gaddafi was honoured with a state visit to Paris in late 2007. He was referred to as the 'Brother Leader' by the French president, and allowed to pitch his tent next to the Elysee Palace. Scandal: Sarkozy is also accused of accepting millions in illegal cash from L'Oreal cosmetics heiress Liliane Bettencourt . The apparently incriminating evidence emerged through an investigation into Takieddine's involvement in the so-called ‘Karachi Affair’. This involved illegal kickbacks to France on a on a 1994 arms sale to Pakistan, in which Sarkozy is also implicated. As head of state, Sarkozy could not be prosecuted while in office, but within weeks of him losing the election to Francois Hollande in May his Paris home was raided by police. He and his third wife, Carla Bruni, were abroad in to Canada at the time, but Sarkozy has since been made an ‘assisted witness’ in the so called ‘Bettencourt Affair’. This is yet another corruption scandal, in which Sarkozy is accused of accepting millions in illegal cash from Liliane Bettencourt, the l’Oreal heiress and France’s richest woman. Sarkozy turned on his friend Gaddafi at the beginning of the Arab Spring, French jets were the first to attack Gaddafi's tanks in a brutal military campaign which ended with the Libyan leader being murdered. Sarkozy was unable for comment on today’s revelations, but has previously claimed that the Gaddafi accusations are 'grotesque'. Takieddine, who is worth upwards of £100 million, was last year involved in a bitter divorce from his estranged British wife, Nicola Johnson, 50. The couple enjoyed living in a number of homes across the world, including Warwick House, in Holland Park, west London, which was estimated to be worth upwards of £17 million. Takieddene is under investigation for the role he played in the Karachi affair, but denies any wrong doing.","Arms dealer claims that the majority of the money was paid before Sarkozy came to power .

"Milton Keynes Dons' remarkable cup run is set to continue after they overcame fellow League One high-fliers Bradford City at Stadium mk. Benik Afobe, who scored twice against Manchester United in the second round, bagged another brace as Karl Robinson's side reached the last 16 of the Capital One Cup for the first time in their history. Afobe netted in the fifth minute to put the Dons ahead, and then sealed the victory five minutes from time to earn the Dons a place in round four. Benik Afobe smashes in his spectacular first goal from just outside the Bradford box to put MK Dons ahead . The on-loan Arsenal striker celebrates his fourth Capital One Cup goal of the seaon, and his fifth would follow . James Meredith struggles to get the ball off MK Dons' Dean Bowditch as the hosts held out . The first goal in particular was spectacular, as the on-loan Arsenal striker spun away from his marker and fired into the bottom corner from 20 yards for his ninth goal of the season. On the night his parent club went out of the competition at home to Southampton, it was the kind of inspiration they could have done with. Bradford, who famously reached the final of this competition two years ago, had plenty of chances to get back into the game, Mason Bennet and Jason Kennedy spurning the best opportunities as the visitors shaded possession. Afobe had the pace, and the finish, to wrap the game up late on with his ninth goal of the season . MK Dons boss Karl Robinson congratulates his striker after Afobe booked the Dons' place in the next round . But the Bantams were unable to find an equaliser, and when Liverpool target Dele Alli slid the ball through for Afobe in the 86th minute the striker had the pace and composure to secure the win. MK Dons assistant manager Richie Barker was full of praise for the on-loan striker who has now bagged nine goals in this season's competition. 'Benik has scored a lot of one-on-ones because of his pace,' said Barker, 'but the way he took his first goal was excellent. I didn't realise how good it was until I watched it the second time around. 'He's got everything. And to be fair to him and Will Grigg - who have rotated - every time one of them starts they end up scoring and it gives us a headache in terms of team selection.' Afobe sank to his knees in celebration after securing MK Dons their best ever League Cup showing .","Afobe scores at the beginning and the end to see off Bradford .

"A Canadian model was allegedly involved in smuggling over 50,000 MDMA pills and about 40 kilograms of the drug before being apprehended at a California airport on Thursday. Krista Marieann Boseley and fellow Canadian Gilles Joseph Pierre Lapointe were both charged in the incident, documents obtained by The Smoking Gun reveal. Boseley was photographed during an open call for Playboy and is reportedly a real estate agent, according to the website. Stopped: Krista Boseley, pictured, was reportedly involved smuggling MDMA into California from Las Vegas . Ready for the cameras: Boseley was photographed during an open call for Playboy and is reportedly real estate agent and her work is visible here on a Model Mayhem page . Authorities went to John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana on Thursday to search for a plane, '[b]ased on an investigation in another district [...] that the airplane or its occupants may be involved in the smuggling of narcotics or currency,' the documents say. Boseley and Lapointe were seen by plain clothes investigators arriving at the airport, taking their luggage out the private plane, and going to a rental car desk before they were stopped outside near the rented vehicle, according to the court documents. Lapointe was spoken to separately by investigators, one of whom wrote in the affidavit that he 'immediately saw a large sum of United States currency' after opening the man's backpack. The documents say Lapointe told investigators the $13,000 found was actually casino winnings from the Bellagio Hotel. Boseley reportedly told authorities the $7,500 in her purse was also Bellagio casino winnings . Apprehended: Boseley and Gilles Lapointe were both nabbed by authorities at John Wayne Airport on Thursday (file photo) Boseley reportedly told authorities the $7,500 in her purse was also Bellagio casino winnings. After using a drug dog, authorities later found 'approximately 30,000' MDMA pills in Lapointe's carry-on luggage, according to the documents. An additional 28,000 MDMA pills and 40 kilograms of the drug were found during a search of the plane, along with a GPS tracker detector, the documents say. During the investigation, it was revealed 'that Boseley was stopped approximately September 16, 2013, by the Los Angeles Police Department and she was found with over $40,000 in cash. Boseley stated at that time that the money belonged to someone else.' It does not appear Boseley is behind bars, though Lapointe currently is, The Smoking Gun reported.","Canadian model Krista Boseley is accused of smuggling drugs into Johne Wayne Airport in Santa Ana, California on Thursday .

"Costa Rica striker Joel Campbell has the chance to further prove to Arsene Wenger on Saturday that he is worthy of a place in Arsenal's squad next season. But Wenger is set to farm Campbell out on loan again. Campbell, 22, spent last season in Greece playing for Olympiakos. But Wenger is more inclined to loan Campbell to a Premier League club - at least until January - this season. West Ham, Everton, Southampton and Newcastle are all interested. Out to impress: Joel Campbell trains on Friday ahead of Costa Rica's semi-final against Holland . Rising star: Wenger will have been impressed by Joel Campbell at the World Cup but will still end him on loan . Club promotion: Wenger at dinner with Fabio Cannavaro (left), Christian Vieri (third left) and Juan Sebastian Veron (second right) One of the features of this World Cup has been the number of headed goals - there have been 32 so far. Surely the best remains Robin van Persie’s supreme diving header in Holland’s opening win over Spain. It’s nearly twice as likely for a goal to be scored in the second half of Saturday's games. So far 94 have been scored in the second half compared to 57 in the first half, with seven having been struck in extra time. Marouane Fellaini has stated he has nothing to prove to Manchester United when he plays for Belgium against Argentina on Saturday. Even if he wanted to make a point, it is a bit late for that. New manager Louis van Gaal has agreed with the club’s hierarchy to sell the player signed from Everton for £27million last summer. Defiant: Marouane Fellaini says he has nothing to prove to Manchester United fans after a poor season . A move back to Everton or Newcastle is on the cards but both clubs won’t want to pay more than a cut price £12m. A loan move is a possibility. Former England boss Glenn Hoddle has said he no longer wants to see Brazil win the World Cup in their own back yard because they are not playing Samba football. His point is backed up by the fact that their goals in the knockout phase have been scored by their defenders - the strongest part of their team - with David Luiz netting twice and Thiago Silva once. Indeed ex-Chelsea star Luiz - now of PSG - could become the icon of this team if they go on to win the tournament. With pin-up star Neymar, still their top scorer with four goals, ruled out of the World Cup, Luiz - who scored a wonder free-kick in the 2-1 win over Columbia - has now emerged as Brazil's talisman - much to Hoddle’s dismay. Former Liverpool striker of the Seventies David Fairclough was the first player in English football to be dubbed a supersub because of his knack of coming off the bench (in the days when there was only one sub) and scoring vital goals. This World Cup has become the tournament of the super sub. So far 29 goals have been scored by subs compared to 15 in 2010 . One to Watch: . Lets hope it’s a sight to behold rather than a kicking - or diving - match and we see Arjen Robben or Robin van Persie - or both - rise to the occasion and set up a semi-final most likely against Lionel Messi and Argentina in a battle of Jogo Bonito. Time to shine: Robin van Persie has the chance to lead Hollland into the World Cup semi-finals on Saturday . World Cup Moment: . After putting England to the sword in the quarter finals of the 1986 World Cup finals, Maradona then put on another one-man demolition show in the semis against Belgium - scoring twice in Argentina's 2-0 win. One-man show: Maradona scored twice as Argentina beat Belgium in the 1986 World Cup semi-finals . I Say:Phil Neville’s nightmare performance as commentator in the England v Italy game has seen Danny Murphy move up the packing order. And the ex-Liverpool, Fulham and England midfielder has taken his chance superbly. His comments and quips in the classic Belgium-USA game were class. And the way he constantly berated Fellaini bordered on comic genius. But I hope he doesn’t pursue a career in broadcasting because, given his insight into the game, he should go into coaching. I have spent time in his company and his knowledge and willingness to cut through the b******* is impressive.

"On the road that runs adjacent to the Dique do Tororo lake directly in front of Salvador’s Arena Fonte Nova, a familiar ritual has been played out every single match day of this World Cup. In the hours before kick-off, boys from the nearby slum houses have emerged to play football in the road. The best player has to play with one shoe off. Nearby, those not old enough to join in race up and down on bicycles with no tyres on. Part of it is exhibitionism. The thousands of visitors pouring round the lake on the way to the stadium provided a ready-made audience. Largely, though, these games simply represented a desperate desire to be involved in a tournament that never really belonged to them. For these kids have had no greater chance of watching a game taking place on their doorstep than they had of being picked to wear the famous yellow and green. VIDEO Scroll down to watch an angry Brazil fan smash a TV in the street after humiliation . Down and out: Oscar collapses after Brazil's capitulation against a ruthless Germany . Looking on in horror: Brazil fans watch their beloved Selecao crumble in quite astonishing fashion . Instead, their World Cup experience comprised watching matches on shared TVs, some stationed on boxes in the street, some powered by stolen electricity. This was the World Cup for them and millions like them. And now even that is over. There are two ways to view the disaster that befell Luiz Felipe Scolari’s Brazil team in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday night. It can be seen as a sporting disappointment placed in proper context or as a symbolic humiliation of a population fast losing ways in which it can feel proud. In a bar on Sao Paulo’s fashionable Avenue Paulista on Tuesday night — it cost £30 for beer, fried food and a seat in front of a TV — the patrons had forgotten about the game by the time the musicians struck up in an awning outside afterwards. Just a few miles away, though, a gang was breaking into a bus depot to set fire to a fleet of vehicles. Elsewhere in Sao Paulo, electrical shops were looted. Sirens wailed through the night, at times masking the fireworks that — on this occasion — symbolised desolation rather than celebration. In Recife, on the north-east coast, mounted police broke up fights in the FIFA Fan Fest while in Rio gangs of youths attacked and robbed tourists outside the Copacabana Hotel. Spelling it out: Brazil was rocked by a quite astonishing result . Final insult: Germany fans in Lebanon set fire to a Brazil flag after they watched the game in Beirut . The last time Brazil were humiliated on home soil at a World Cup — a comparatively tame 2-1 defeat by Uruguay in 1950 — they changed their kit as part of turning over a new leaf. They ditched their white shirts and chose the now famous yellow jerseys instead. So where now? Back to white or maybe black to show they are in mourning? Like any social or civil unrest, the root causes run deep. This isn’t really about football. But with so much public money being ploughed into this bloated, middle class, corporate event, it was always likely that the fall-out would be grim if things went wrong on the field. In the run-up to a tournament that millions in Brazil simply did not want, the public seemed to cut an unspoken deal with the authorities and with FIFA. If Brazil give us what we want on the pitch, we will tolerate this tournament. If they don’t, we will have our say. Nobody, of course, thought for one moment that it would end like this. Defeat is one thing, humiliation quite another. As the respected veteran journalist Gustavo Eduardo Poli, from TV Globo, told the BBC: ‘There will be anger. There is anger already but we don’t know the full reaction. Not yet.’ Brazil wept publicly. On TV they dissected the performance of Scolari’s team all morning. Reaction in the newspapers was colourful. ‘Go to Hell, Phil,’ declared one. Another merely congratulated the team who lost the 1950 World Cup final to Uruguay as being better than the current version.All that is froth, of course. As Poli said, the chances are that the real, devastating impact of this sporting catastrophe will actually be played out in the coming days and weeks and nobody knows yet quite how bad it will be.Forget the TV pictures of the pretty girls crying in the stands as Germany humiliated Brazil in the Estadio Mineirao. Their pain is unlikely to have lingered much longer than it took to take a taxi home to the suburbs. The real anguish here will be felt by those at the other end of the lop-sided socio-economic pyramid. It will be felt by those still waiting for proper roads in Natal, a subway completion in Salvador (work began in 2001) and a proper drainage system in Recife. Fans' fury: Angry Brazilian supporters torched a bus in Sao Paulo after their team's shambolic show . The morning after the night before: Torched buses sit ruined in a depot in the wake of defeat . They say that sport imitates life but not in Brazil it doesn’t. Here, it only serves to highlight the differences between one kind of life and another. Only two outfield players in Scolari’s squad earn their living in the Brazilian league. When you consider that every member of the great Brazilian teams of the 1962 and 1970 World Cups played in South America then the disconnect felt by the public is clear. These days, Brazil’s national league is a debt-ridden, under-performing shambles. Top clubs such as Corinthians and Flamengo are millions of pounds in debt. Others failed to pay player wages last season. It’s no surprise then that Brazil’s brightest young players are hauled off to talent factories in Russia and Ukraine before being recycled -— at huge personal gain — into the European leagues when they are good enough. The players of the national team couldn’t be further removed from those street kids in Salvador if they tried and the irony of this defeat by Germany is that a European game that has for so long been creaming off Brazil’s talent has now returned to kick sand in its face on its own shores and in front of its own disintegrating public. The public in Brazil cannot soothe themselves — as we do in England and Italy and Spain — with the thought of the recommencing of successful domestic leagues and new forays in to the Champions League. These last few weeks represented the last chance for the Brazilians to see their own players for a while. Under control: Police officers take actions to keep order after the match in Belo Horizonte . On the march: Brazilian police officers are watchful following unrest in Belo . At times it has been tempting to believe that the Brazilian lower classes have taken something from this tournament. The yellow and green bunting strung across the pot-holed roads of the favelas appeared to indicate patriotism. On the fringes of the beach-front Fan Fests in Fortaleza, Recife and Natal, meanwhile, locals have partied enthusiastically, drinking cheap weak beer dispensed by street hawkers and eating food grilled on makeshift barbecues. On every street corner, though, have stood the Brazilian riot police, a constant reminder of just what might happen. The Brazilian authorities are perhaps fortunate that the third-placed game their team play on Saturday takes place in Brasilia. A new town built in 1960, the capital — with its wide roads and Manhattan-style grid system — is as easy to police as anywhere. The government do face an election in October, though, and it is hard to believe the ramifications of a World Cup that will now be remembered for only one game will not be felt at the polls. Back in 1950, Brazil sank under the weight of that loss to Uruguay at their own Maracana. The Maracanaza (the Maracana Blow) hit like a hammer. Sixty-four years on, there is no reason to suspect the affect will be any different. ‘I played for 19 years,’ said Zizinho, a member of the 1950 Brazil team. ‘I won a few titles and yet  now I’m just remembered as a loser.’","Brazil's humiliation can be seen as a sporting disappointment or as a symbolic humiliation of a population fast losing ways in which it can feel proud .

"She's been linked to a string of eligible bachelors since splitting from her long-term boyfriend, Alex Loudon, last year. But Pippa Middleton has now been pictured on a 'date' with James Matthews, the wealthy investment banker brother of Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews. The 37-year-old seemed to be the perfect gentleman as he helped the sister of the Duchess of Cambridge into a cab following a night out at an exclusive London restaurant earlier this month. New romance? Pippa Middleton is reportedly dating James Matthews, the brother of Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews . And Pippa, 29, certainly seemed to have dressed up for the occasion, looking chic and stylish in a black shift dress and lace-detail jacket. Meanwhile, James looked smart as he held the door open for his friend wearing a tailored black jacket, a white shirt and jeans. Friends of the rumoured couple have claimed their relationship is going from 'strength to strength' following a string of dates. The pair were first spotted having dinner at the Queen's Club tennis centre in West London and nine days ago they dined out at the fashionable Hakkasan restaurant, where onlookers said they were 'openly flirting' as they shared a bottle of wine in a 'secluded booth'. Early days: Friends of the couple claim the relationship is going from 'strength to strength' Perfect gentleman: James held the door open for Pippa as she got into a cab following a 'date' at London's exclusive Hakkasan restaurant . Family connections: James is the elder brother of Made In Chelsea's Spencer . A source told the Sunday Mirror newspaper: 'They were deep in conversation and only had eyes for each other. Pippa was all smiles and kept giggling. 'They stayed for nearly three hours and didn't seem to want the meal to end.' James a former Eton pupil, is chief executive of Eden Rock Capital Management Group, which he set-up more than 10 years ago. His brother Spencer, 24, has starred in E4's Made In Chelsea reality show since it first aired last year and their parents, David and Jane, bought Eden Rock, a luxury hotel in the Caribbean, in 1995. Pippa split from her long-term boyfriend of . three-years, City banker Alex Loudon, in 2011. She has since been linked with the Duke of Northumberland's son, George Percy, 28, a friend from her time as a student at Edinburgh University. A friend of Pippa's added: 'Pippa is quite taken with James. She wants to take things slowly at first but she she is ready for a full-time man in her life again.' Pippa was embroiled in controversy earlier this year when she was pictured laughing in a car as a man brandished what appeared to be a gun at photographers in Paris. She was in France for an 18th Century-themed ball, which was also attended by a stripper, a dwarf and people in bondage gear. Last week, she launched a party guide, Celebrate: A Year of British Festivities for Families and Friends, having been paid a £400,000 advance to pen the book. Dating?

"Making waves: MP Penny Mordaunt on Splash! spoke about her compelling life story but omitted her failed marriage . When Tory MP Penny Mordaunt appeared in a primetime ITV diving show, the publicity blitz covered almost every aspect of her compelling life story. But for the woman once voted ‘Britain’s sexiest MP’ one topic was kept strictly off-limits – her short-lived marriage. The 40-year-old MP for Portsmouth North has told friends she was so bruised by the experience that it has put her off ever marrying again. Her wedding to Paul Murray, whom she met while they were both students at Reading University, is omitted from her entries in Who’s Who and Debrett’s. One Westminster database even lists, under ‘number of marriages or civil partnerships’, the figure zero. Ms Mordaunt, an aide to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and a Royal Navy reservist, has attracted scores of admirers – and raised her political profile – since her appearance on Splash!, in which celebrities are trained to dive by Olympic medallist Tom Daley. She was voted off last weekend’s show following an inglorious belly flop into the pool. During interviews to publicise the show, Ms Mordaunt revealed her difficult early years growing up in Portsmouth as the daughter of a paratrooper-turned-teacher. Her mother died of breast cancer when she was 15 – the same year her father was also diagnosed with cancer – turning her into a ‘child carer’. She took a job as a magician’s assistant to fund her way through college, which involved her being ‘sawn in half’. She also told of her ‘life-changing’ year working in Romanian orphanages, before going to university  to study philosophy, and that she has a gay twin brother. Scroll down for video . Revealed: Her marriage certificate to Paul Murray in 1999 when they were both 26. She told friends the experience left her so bruised she never wants to marry again . The only mention of her personal life was that she lives with her partner, Ian Lyon, a classical singer, Burmese cat breeder and director of an IT company, in Portsmouth. They have eight cats, but no children. However, a marriage certificate shows that she wed Mr Murray, the son of retired Lieut Col Leonard Murray, in July 1999, when they were both 26. Mr Murray was listed as an ‘assistant hall manager’ while Ms Mordaunt, who was then starting a career in public relations, was described as a ‘press officer’. One friend said: ‘The marriage is completely off-limits, a no-go zone. It went wrong quite quickly, and she says it has put her off for life.’ The MP for Portsmouth North was voted off the ITV show last weekend after a belly flop in the pool . The Mail on Sunday can also reveal that Ms Mordaunt helped to secure the acquittal of one of her university lecturers after he was falsely accused of indecently assaulting two students. John Cottingham, now the emeritus Professor of Philosophy at Reading University, had been accused of trying to seduce the pair by discussing bondage and the work of the Marquis de Sade during a garden party. He walked free from court after a 1997 trial in which Ms Mordaunt, then 24, said she had ‘no hesitation’ in coming forward to support Professor Cottingham. She said she had attended a conference at Oxford on her own at which the professor was also present – without incident – and had ‘never felt threatened’ in his presence. Yesterday, a spokesman for Ms Mordaunt said she was not available for comment.","Short-lived marriage to fellow university student kept off-limits in show .

"The 30-year-old woman who went missing in a rainforest for 17 days told police that she could hear rescue teams calling out for her and helicopters circling the area. Cairns police have said they believe Shannon Leah Fraser, who insists she could not get to the rescue teams despite being able to hear them, ABC reports. Ms Fraser - a cancer patient and mother of three- was last seen at the Golden Hole swimming spot, south of Cairns, Queensland on September 21. Scroll down for video . Shannon Leah Fraser was reported missing on September 21 but was found by a farmer on Wednesday morning . She was found on Wednesday morning when a farmer noticed her stumbling out of the bush badly burnt, scratched up and noticeably thinner. Her mother says her daughter has miraculously survived a 17-day ordeal lost in rugged bushland where she lived on creek water, small fish and insects. 'She's badly burnt, she's lost a lot of weight,' Ms Sharrock told The Courier Mail. 'She's got a lot of infected cuts from fighting the scrub. She told us she just sat in a creek for three days to soothe her cuts and burns. 'It's incredible, it's amazing, we all thought she was dead. Thank God, she's alive.' She said her daughter was now recovering in hospital. The 30-year-old was last seen at the Golden Hole swimming spot, south of Cairns . Police have not confirmed any of the circumstances around Ms Fraser's reappearance, other than to say she was found safe and well on Wednesday morning. Ms Fraser had gone to the swimming hole with two men including her partner. Her partner later told police he'd left her sitting alone under a gazebo near the river but when he returned five or 10 minutes later, she was gone. Her disappearance sparked an intensive search, police suspicions she might have met with foul play, and a public appeal for information by her mother.","Shannon Leah Fraser was reported missing on September 21 .

"Scientists have shown, for the first time, that parents' children can resemble the mother's previous partner - at least in neriid flies. This controversial idea, known as telegony, dates back to ancient Greek times, but was discredited in the early 20th Century with the advent of genetics. However scientists found that the size of young neriid flies was determined by the size of the first male the mother mated with, rather than the second male that fathered the offspring. Scientists from the University of New South Wales claim that the controversial theory of telegony could be true. This suggests a female's previous male partner decides some of the characteristics of offspring she has with the next. This was based on evidence from young neriid flies (shown) The scientists from the University of New South Wales in Australia tested the theory by  manipulating the size of male flies, and studying their offspring. 'Our discovery complicates our entire view of how variation is transmitted across generations, but also opens up exciting new possibilities and avenues of research,' said lead author Dr Crean. 'Just as we think we have things figured out, nature throws us a curve ball and shows us how much we still have to learn.' The researchers propose that the phenomenon is due to molecules in the seminal fluid of the first mate being absorbed by the female's immature eggs, and then influencing the growth of offspring of a subsequent mate. Telegony is a widely discredited idea that suggests children of a particular species can inherit characteristics from a mother’s previous mate. The theory was popular in the 19th century but, with an increased understanding of genetics in the 20th century, it has been viewed as inconsistent with current theories. Several experiments have failed to prove any evidence of telegony. Meanwhile a statistical investigation of telegony in humans found no correlation and ruled out the idea. The latest research, however, will be food for thought for some who had previously declared telegony an impossibility. The study was published in the journal Ecology Letters. The team produced large and small male flies by feeding them diets as larvae that were high or low in nutrients. They then mated the immature females with either a large or a small male. Once the females had matured, they were mated again with either a big or a small male, and their offspring were studied. 'We found that even though the second male sired the offspring, offspring size was determined by what the mother's previous mating partner ate as a maggot,' Dr Crean. Despite major advances in genetics, many questions remain about how some traits are inherited. 'We know that features that run in families are not just influenced by the genes that are passed down from parents to their children,' Dr Clean added. 'Various non-genetic inheritance mechanisms make it possible for maternal or paternal environmental factors to influence characteristics of a child.' In the flies, for example, it has been shown that males that are well-fed as larvae go on to produce big offspring. 'Our new findings take this to a whole new level - showing a male can also transmit some of his acquired features to offspring sired by other males,' she says. 'But we don't know yet whether this applies to other species.' The idea of telegony - that a male can leave a mark on his mate's body that influences her offspring to a different male - originated with the Greek philosopher Aristotle. It was a concern to royalty in the 1300s and still popular as a scientific hypothesis in the 1800s but rejected in the early 1900s as incompatible with the new science of genetics. Scientists found that the size of young neriid flies was determined by the size of the first male the mother mated with. They add they 'don't know yet whether this applies to other species' (stock image shown). Advances in genetics in the 20th century had previously discredited the theory of telegony .","Scientists from the University of New South Wales claim that the controversial theory of telegony could be true .

"A paralyzed man walked down the aisle to his wedding in upstate New York on Saturday. A robotic exoskeleton called an Ekso allowed groom Matt Ficarra to make the trek with wife Jordan Basile to 'Sign, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours,' The Syracuse Post-Standard reported. Both guests and bridesmaids cried during the newlyweds' walk, the newspaper reported. Nuptials: Bride Jordan Basile and groom Matt Ficarra were married on Saturday . The happy couple: Ficarra, who was paralyzed three years ago, was able to stand and walk by using a robotic exoskeleton . Ficarra told the newspaper he used the device in visits each week at an Allentown rehabilitation center. 'It feels great to be married,' he told The Syracuse Post-Standard of the nuptials, which took place in DeWitt. 'And I am so happy to have met my goal of walking at my wedding.' His father Frank Ficarra told the paper before his son said 'I do,' 'It's spectacular. I am so proud of him. He's determined and he accomplishes what he sets out to do.' Ficarra became paralyzed after a summertime boating accident three years ago, according to The Syracuse Post-Standard. 'I didn't realize how shallow the water was,' he told the newspaper. 'On one of the jumps, the side of the boat was wet and I slipped. I went into the water headfirst.' Emotional: Both guests and bridesmaids cried during the newlyweds' walk . I do! The couple were engaged last year at Christmastime . 'I remember looking up at the sun through the water,' he also said. 'I was floating, and then I remember not being able to move anything - not even a finger or a toe. I got very calm and accepted that this was the end. Then at the last second someone scooped me out of the water.' The two texted six months in the wake of the boating accident then went out, Basile told the newspaper. She earlier twice rejected his offers, calling him an 'obnoxious' college athlete. 'We got to know each other that way before we started dating,' she said. 'He was more settled then, and I was in a better place too. We have been together every moment since then. We have fun together, and we don't let life pass us by.' Basile also said of her husband's walk before the wedding 'I'm so happy for him.' 'Walking down that aisle means a lot to him. But for me, it doesn't really matter. He could be sitting or crawling down the aisle - all that matters to me is that he's by my side.'","A robotic exoskeleton called an Ekso allowed groom Matt Ficarra to walk down the aisle to his upstate New York wedding .

"Jack Laugher became the most successful diver at these Games by winning the three-metres synchronised title with training partner and ‘best mate’ Chris Mears. The pair, who train in Leeds, embraced when the big screen confirmed a score of 431.94 before seeking out their mothers to ‘give them a big squeeze’. They finished 28 points ahead of Australian silver medalists Matt Mitcham and Grant Nel, with English pair Nick Robinson-Baker and Freddie Woodward clinching a surprise bronze with 364.41 points.

Perfect timing: Laugher (left) and Mears (right) pull off a dive on their way to winning gold . Laugher, 19, already had two Commonwealth gold medals and one silver before Tom Daley had even competed at Edinburgh’s Royal Commonwealth Pool, proving that British diving is more than a one-man show. Mears, 21, is one of Sportsmail’s Road to Rio athletes. ‘These Games have been an absolute dream for me,’ said Laugher. ‘I was hoping, if I could get lucky, to come away with three medals. To come away with two golds and a silver is fantastic.’ Laugher, who was crowned one-metre springboard champion on Wednesday and a silver medallist in the three-metres individual event on Thursday, added: ‘To do the last one with my best mate and to get that alongside each other is what we have been dreaming of all year.’ Laugher and Mears’ best dive was an inward three-and-a-half somersault, for 85.68, but the pair produced three dives over 80 points in a world-class performance. Mears, a music producer in his spare time, told Laugher jokes and they reminded each other of their favourite movie lines between nerve-shredding dives. Too good: Laugher and Mears finished almost 30 points ahead of Australia after a series of impressive dives . Double success: England's Nick Baker-Robinson (second from right) and Freddie Woodward (right) pose alongside the gold medallists after winning bronze . ‘I see Chris dancing around to house music, throwing his hands in the air, while I listen to more chilled music,’ said Laugher. ‘We get each other laughing between dives. If you’re happy and chilled out, you dive well.’ Mears, fourth in the one-metre springboard, was delighted to make amends. ‘I was gutted with the one-metre,’ he said, ‘I was so close to the bronze that it put pressure on me today.’ Mears recovered from life-saving surgery to remove a ruptured spleen suffered while diving in 2009 and added: . ‘I learnt a lot. I probably wouldn’t have made London if I hadn’t gone through that. I wasn’t really working hard at school or in training.

"Andy Murray was knocked out of Wimbledon at the quarter-final stage by Grigor Dimitrov on Wednesday as the defending champion succumbed meekly in straight sets. Despite having won two major titles and Olympic gold, Murray has at times been guilty of losing with a whimper at the highest level. Here, Sportsmail looks back at occasions when the Scot has underperformed. French Open 2014 SF – Rafael Nadal beat Andy Murray 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 . Having missed Roland Garros the year before due to a back injury, Murray impressively reached the last four in Paris for a second time. Two tough five-setters earlier in the tournament against Gael Monfils and Philipp Kohlschreiber came back to bite as the Scot ran out of gas against the ‘King of Clay’, winning only 10 points on Nadal’s serve as he was knocked out in one hour and 40 minutes. Making light work of that: Rafael Nadal beat Andy Murray in just an hour and 40 minutes at the French Open . US Open 2013 QF – Stan Wawrinka beat Andy Murray 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 . Coming into a Grand Slam for the first time as a defending champion and with the confidence gained from ending the 77-year wait for a Wimbledon male champion, Murray was highly fancied to claim a second US Open crown. Big-hitting Wawrinka prevailed, though, in two hours and 15 minutes as a frustrated Murray claimed he was mentally exhausted after his SW19 heroics. Problem: Murray couldn't take the strain as he went out to Stanislas Wawrinka at the US Open last year . Australian Open 2011 F – Novak Djokovic beat Andy Murray 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 . Djokovic condemned Murray to his third Grand Slam final defeat as the Serbian stormed to victory on a hot and humid night in Melbourne. A nervy start cost Murray and he failed to find a way back into the match. Murray struggled to deal with the aftermath as he suffered a slump in form, losing his next three tournament openers in straight sets.

Play looked to be done for the day as the match was suspended at 8pm due to rain with Berdych leading 6-4, 3-4, but the weather cleared and the players returned to the court. Murray looked as if he did not want to be there and the Czech took just 50 minutes to wrap up the win. Shock: Murray couldn't control his emotions during a 2010 French Open defeat against Tomas Berdych . US Open 2009 4R – Marin Cilic beat Andy Murray 7-5, 6-2, 6-2 . Murray always reckoned his search for a Grand Slam title would end on the hard courts of Flushing Meadows and rightly so after reaching the final the previous year. However, Murray failed to take two set points in the first set and had no answer to Cilic’s power as the Croatian took charge to seal the upset.

"Alastair Cook's increasingly desperate run search has not gone unnoticed by England’s opponents in the upcoming Test series, and yesterday India batsman Virat Kohli piled more pressure on the home side’s troubled captain. England’s opening batsman will start Tuesday’s first Investec Test at Trent Bridge under more intense scrutiny than at any point since taking over from Andrew Strauss in 2012. After beginning his captaincy tenure with five hundreds in nine Tests — including 562 runs at an average of more than 80 in leading his side to an historic series win in India — Cook’s flatlining form has coincided with an alarming slump in his side’s fortunes. VIDEO Scroll down for India batsman Virat Kohli excited for Test series in England . Flatline: Alastair Cook's recent form will see him targetted by India in the upcoming Test series . Under-fire: Cook's England captaincy is under scrutiny following a poor run of results, including loss to Sri Lanka . VIDEO Broad backs captain Cook . Without a hundred in 24 Test innings, and following successive series defeats to Australia and  Sri Lanka, Kohli believes the  captaincy is weighing heavily on the 29-year-old’s shoulders. ‘Cook was batting brilliantly when he came to India (in 2012) and he made full use of that,’ Kohli said. ‘Obviously, right now, things have been pretty difficult for him. Everyone goes through that phase where they don’t score runs, but because he has the captaincy as well that might be troubling him. ‘We know he’s a quality player and he can come back at any  time. We’d like to keep him under  pressure and get him out early, because the English batting has revolved around him for the last few years. ‘He’s going to be a big player in this series and we’d like to get him early to get momentum.’ Cook retains overwhelming  support within the England dressing room and yesterday received more backing from one of his  senior lieutenants, Stuart Broad. After supporting Cook to the hilt following the winter’s 5-0 Ashes whitewash, and sacking Kevin  Pietersen in the process, senior  figures at the ECB have much to lose if he fails to deliver. But defeat at Trent Bridge and a failure to make a significant contribution with the bat would surely leave Cook on the brink. ‘He is our highest scorer of hundreds ever and he has not got one for a year so he’ll be desperate to get back on that wagon,’ Broad said. ‘We all know the quality he has.’ Target: Virat Kholi admits India will try and take advantage of Cook's lack of confidence . Heavy hitter: England are expected to recall fit-again Ben Stokes for the Test series against India . While his batting form speaks for itself, Cook’s tactical acumen has also been questioned, with his apparent reluctance to go for the jugular costing England on more than one occasion. This week at Trent Bridge  England are expected to recall their most exciting prospect with fit-again Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes — one of the few England players to return from Australia with his reputation enhanced — likely to return at the expense of Chris Jordan. Stokes fielded at third slip alongside Ian Bell and Cook in practice yesterday and his impressive bowling form for Durham in recent weeks, allied to his proven batting record, should see the 23-year-old return for the first time since he broke his hand punching a locker in Barbados last March. ‘Ben has the X-factor and is a maverick,’ said his Durham coach Jon Lewis yesterday. ‘He has the ability to change a game faster than any other player I’ve known and that makes him stand out. He is a competitor in every sense of the word. He has the ability to make things happen.’ Stokes’s return would see  England take the field boasting nine batsman with Test hundreds to their name.

Broad, who made three figures against Pakistan at Lord’s in 2010, would bat at nine, though his bowling will be more useful during a five-Test series packed into 42 days. The 28-year-old has been hampered by patella tendinitis over recent months and he, along with England’s other fast bowlers, are likely to be rotated at some point in the series. ‘We’ve got a great opportunity to play a lot of cricket for  England in the next five or six weeks, but we will have to look after our bodies,’ he said. ‘It’s an annoying phone call you get from the selector that you’re missing out the next game because you’re being rotated, but I think it is pretty sensible.’","Virat Kohli admits Alastair Cook will be targeted by India in Test series .

"Neymar will be fit to play for Brazil in Friday's World Cup quarter-final against Colombia, despite suffering from thigh and knee injuries sustained against Chile. Brazil's confederation said on Monday that team doctor Jose Luiz Runco checked on Neymar when the squad returned to its training camp and revealed the player is not a concern for the host's clash in Fortaleza. Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari was worried following Saturday’s win over Chile, saying Neymar could take days to be fit and that doctors would have to do their 'best to put him on the pitch.'

Neymar complained of a left thigh injury after Brazil’s penalty shoot-out win over Chile, while Runco also said the player was also being treated for a knock on his right knee. Confederation spokesman Rodrigo Paiva did say the player could miss a few training sessions depending on how the injuries progress. 'The worst is the knee, it’s what’s hurting the most,' Paiva said. 'He may be rested from practice if needed. He will be evaluated again, but Runco said fans don’t have to worry because he’s not a concern for the match.' The Barcelona frontman was subjected to heavy challenges during the match against Chile, and twice had to leave the pitch for treatment. Neymar admitted he played with pain the rest of the match while manager Scolari said the attacker’s thigh was extremely swollen in the dressing room after the match.

"A slimmer has found an unusual incentive to stick to her diet and exercise regime. Mel Fraser began posting 'belfies' - or bottom selfies - online to motivate her to continue to drop the pounds, managing to lose an impressive 5st 7lb in total. Celebrities Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj launched the trend for taking so called 'bum selfies' and Mel used hers to track her slimming progress. Having tried to lose weight many times Mel found the combination of the Cambridge diet and posting progress 'belfies' online worked for her and she finally lost nearly 6st (before, left; after, right) But she says it was the support she received via social media that really spurred on her dieting. The beauty salon assistant's surprising method saw her lose almost 6st, shrinking from a dress size 20 to an eight. And now the mother-of-one has more than 10,000 online followers, with whom she shares healthy meal ideas, exercise techniques — and photos of her shrinking botttom. Mel, 24, from Glasgow, says: 'I used to be so fat I hated going outside the house because I couldn't bear the thought of anyone looking at me. In total 5ft 2in Mel dropped from 15st 2lb and a size 20 to a ultra toned 9st 9lb and size eight . 'Now I post pictures of my body to thousands of people. 'I love my new shape and have Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to thank for helping me get it. 'Posting pictures of my body as it changes keeps me on track and it's great to know that I'm now helping other people get the body they want.' Mel's weight spiralled out of control after she had daughter Aimee, now four. As the relationship with her daughter's father began to falter, Mel started comfort eating. She says: 'With a baby to look after, it was easier to turn to convenience food than cook from scratch. Instead of losing baby weight, I started to get bigger.' Mel got locked into a cycle of eating junk food, admitting: 'If I was miserable, I would treat myself to a bag of crisps or a chocolate bar to cheer myself up but I was just making the problem worse.' Mel started a beauty therapy course but got in the habit of eating a pizza on the way home. She says: 'I was in constant denial, telling myself there wasn't time to cook and that eating a takeaway was OK.' Mel was out shopping with a friend when she decided to weigh herself in a shop. She burst into tears when the scales crept up to 15st 2lb. At just 5ft 2in tall, she was classed as medically obese. Mel reveals: 'I was shocked. I had no idea I was that heavy. I weighed more then than I did when I was nine months pregnant. Mel's size meant she was ashamed to leave her house or even go to the supermarket (left) but now she is full of confidence (right) 'I was so embarrassed that I started to dread being seen by anyone I knew.' Mel began making excuses not to leave her home. She explains: 'When my mates pestered me to go out, I told them I couldn't get a babysitter and I started getting my shopping delivered so I could avoid the supermarket.' She also arranged for her mother Julie, 45, to take Aimee out on walks and trips to the park. Mel says: 'Of course I wished I could go, but I was worried I'd have a panic attack. I was so horrified by my appearance that I assumed others would be, too.' Stuck at home, she used takeaway junk food to make her feel better. Mel says: 'It was ridiculous. I was a prisoner in my own home because of how I felt about my weight, yet each week the grocery delivery would be full of pizza, biscuits and crisps. 'I felt I was letting Aimee down. She deserved a healthy mum who could do things with her.' In January 2012, Mel's New Year's Resolution was to visit the gym — but she only managed a handful of sessions. Just two months later she forced herself to leave the house again when Aimee asked that her birthday party be at a soft-play centre. Mel says: 'I was dreading it. I'd hidden away for so long and I knew people would be shocked to see how big I was. I noticed the look of surprise on the faces of some guests as I arrived.' As the pounds continued to fall off, Mel continued sharing selfies with her online pals to keep motivated . Mel clearly took a leaf out of KIm Kardashian's book with her unusual weight loss tracking method . Days later, Mel's mother emailed her pictures of the day and Mel broke down in tears. She says: 'I looked like a beached whale.' In desperation, Mel began researching diets and found the Cambridge Weightloss Plan. Weeks later, she was swapping takeaways and junk food for three calorie-controlled milkshakes a day. Mel says: 'At first it was tough but I knew I had to stick at it for my daughter's sake. It was torture cooking dinner for her and not being able to have any. 'But I had such an unhealthy relationship with food that I needed a plan that took it out of the equation all together and the Cambridge offered me that. As Mel began to exercise she started to post near daily pictures, gaining over 10,000 followers . Mel says she was hooked on weight lifting straight away and soon began to see the difference in her arms . 'I felt hungry for the first time in years. I had forgotten what it felt like.' Mel was thrilled to lose 9lb in the first week of her diet alone, and the next week she lost a further 5lb. The sudden weight loss made her begin to post comments online about her diet. She says: 'It was amazing to get so much support back, especially from forums and Facebook pages where others were following the same diet as me and we could support each other.' Mel also began posting selfies online, charting her progress. She explains: 'I was really nervous the first time I did it but the comments I got were so lovely and encouraging that it gave me a huge boost. I finally rediscovered the confidence to start taking Aimee out to the park.' As the pounds continued to fall off, Mel continued sharing selfies with her online pals to keep motivated. By October 2012, she had lost 5st 7lb and was down to 9st 9lb. But Mel knew that to keep the weight off, she would have to start exercising regularly — and introduce normal food to her diet again. Mel says she now loves showing off her new body and hopes putting her journey online has inspired others . She explains: 'I was hooked on lifting weights straight away and, within weeks, my arms looked strong and firm. 'The feeling that I had the power to change my body to how I wanted was amazing.' Mel made sure to keep her followers up to date with her fitness, too, saying: 'I was posting pictures pretty much every week and people had started to ask how they could lose weight and tone up too. 'I realised social media had helped me lose weight and that now I could use it to help others. 'The comments were so flattering — people said I looked amazing and wished they had a bum like mine. 'It seems crazy that I had gone from hiding indoors to posting pictures of my bum to thousands of people. 'Once, I hated my body so much it was ruining my life — now I can't stop showing it off and I hope it helps others turn their lives around.'","Mel's weight spiralled out of control after she had daughter Aimee, now four .

"It is definitely not a candidate to become a new home for humanity. Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope has made the most detailed global map yet of the glow from a turbulent planet outside our solar system - and found an astonishingly inhospitable environment. The exoplanet, called WASP-43b,  is a world of extremes. This is a temperature map of the 'hot Jupiter' class exoplanet WASP 43b. The white-colored region on the daytime side is 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit. The nighttime side temperatures drop to under 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. First discovered in 2011, WASP-43b is located 260 light-years away. The planet is about the same size as Jupiter, but is nearly twice as dense. The planet is so close to its orange dwarf host star that it completes an orbit in just 19 hours . The planet is too distant to be photographed, but because its orbit is observed edge-on to Earth, astronomers detected it by observing regular dips in the light of its parent star as the planet passes in front of it. Seething winds howl at the speed of sound from a 3,000-degree-Fahrenheit 'day' side, hot enough to melt steel, to a pitch-black 'night' side with plunging temperatures below 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Astronomers mapped the temperatures at different layers of the planet's atmosphere and traced the amount and distribution of water vapor. 'These measurements have opened the door for a new kinds of ways to compare the properties of different types of planets,' said team leader Jacob Bean of the University of Chicago. Seething winds howl at the speed of sound from a 3,000-degree-Fahrenheit 'day' side, hot enough to melt steel, to a pitch-black 'night' side with plunging temperatures below 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. First discovered in 2011, WASP-43b is located 260 light-years away. The planet is too distant to be photographed, but because its orbit is observed edge-on to Earth, astronomers detected it by observing regular dips in the light of its parent star as the planet passes in front of it. 'Our observations are the first of their kind in terms of providing a two-dimensional map on the longitude and altitude of the planet's thermal structure that can be used to constrain atmospheric circulation and dynamical models for hot exoplanets,' said team member Kevin Stevenson of the University of Chicago. As a hot ball of predominantly hydrogen gas, there are no surface features on the planet, such as oceans or continents that can be used to track its rotation. Only the severe temperature difference between the day and night sides can be used by a remote observer to mark the passage of a day on this world. The planet is about the same size as Jupiter, but is nearly twice as dense. The planet is so close to its orange dwarf host star that it completes an orbit in just 19 hours. The planet also is gravitationally locked so that it keeps one hemisphere facing the star, just as our moon keeps one face toward Earth. Scientists combined two previous methods of analyzing exoplanets in an unprecedented technique to study the atmosphere of WASP-43b. They used spectroscopy, dividing the planet's light into its component colors, to determine the amount of water and the temperatures of the atmosphere. By observing the planet's rotation, the astronomers also were able to precisely measure how the water is distributed at different longitudes. Scientists combined two previous methods of analyzing exoplanets in an unprecedented technique to study the atmosphere of WASP-43b with the Hubble Space Telescope. Because there is no planet with these tortured conditions in our solar system, characterizing the atmosphere of such a bizarre world provides a unique laboratory for better understanding planet formation and planetary physics. 'The planet is so hot that all the water in its atmosphere is vaporized, rather than condensed into icy clouds like on Jupiter,' said team member Laura Kreidberg of the University of Chicago. The amount of water in the giant planets of our solar system is poorly known because water that has precipitated out of the upper atmospheres of cool gas giant planets like Jupiter is locked away as ice. But so-called 'hot Jupiters,' gas giants that have high surface temperatures because they orbit very close to their stars, water is in a vapor that can be readily traced. 'Water is thought to play an important role in the formation of giant planets, since comet-like bodies bombard young planets, delivering most of the water and other molecules that we can observe,' said Jonathan Fortney, a member of the team from the University of California, Santa Cruz.","Seething winds howl at the speed of sound .

"They say you 'Gotta go to Mo's', but it would appear that Mo's gotta go to Dick's! The CEO of Modells, a sporting goods chain who once appeared on the TV show 'Undercover Boss' pretended to be an executive from a rival company in an effort to get confidential information, according to a lawsuit. Dick's Sporting Goods claims in a lawsuit filed Feb. 20 in Mercer County Court that Mitchell Modell, CEO of Modell's Sporting Goods, showed up at a Dick's store in Princeton in February saying he was a Dick's senior vice president. Dick's alleges Modell told employees he was to meet the Dick's CEO there and persuaded workers to show him the backroom of the store and to answer questions about the business. In disguise: Mitchell Modell (left), the CEO of Modell's Sporting Goods who appeared Undercover Boss to spy on his employees is now accused by the CEO of rival store Dick's Sporting Goods, Edward Stack (right) Lied to get in: Dick's Sporting Goods claims Modell visited one of its stores in Princeton on Feb. 8 and pretended to be a senior vice president of Dick's who was collecting information about the store . Modell gathered information about online sales, including a 'ship from store' program that gets products to customers' doors quickly, the lawsuit said. Retailers spy on each other all the time. In his autobiography, Sam Walton writes about covert shopping trips to keep tabs on rivals like Kmart and Price Club. 'Ever since retailers first started having cash registers, retailers have scouted each other's stores,' said Burt Flickinger III, president of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group. But if the lawsuit's allegations are true, this appears to be a particularly egregious case. It is rare that a CEO would actually get caught misrepresenting himself to store employees, experts say. Trade war: Modell allegedly told a store manager he had an appointment to meet Dick's CEO Edward Stack at the store and convinced employees to show him around the store's private back areas and answer questions about store operations . Undercover boss: What retail experts find particularly baffling about the complaint is how Modell, a highly visible CEO, thought he wouldn't be recognized. Here he is seen when he legitimately went undercover for the CBS TV program . 'What happens all day every day is retailers go to their competitors' stores and probably and certainly don't disclose who they are,' said RBC Capital Markets analyst Sean McGowan. 'But I can't think of any instances where a retailer represents he is an executive to gain access.' Dick's accuses its rival of civil conspiracy and trespass and is seeking attorneys' fees and a judge's order to prevent Modell and his workers from entering nonpublic areas of Dick's stores or posing as employees. Modell's spokesman Jason Karlowski says he couldn't comment immediately but would be able to answer questions later Friday. In 2012, Mitchell Modell shaved his head and put on an oversized mustache to pose as a low-level employee on the CBS show 'Undercover Boss.' He later said the experience taught him how physically demanding warehouse work was and led to staffing and workload changes throughout the company. His New York-based chain has more than 150 stores, mostly in the Northeast. Dick's, based in Pittsburgh, is a publicly traded company with more than 550 stores nationwide. Pending litigation: Modell's, a family-owned business founded in 1889 and based in New York, has more than 150 stores in 11 states, primarily in the Northeast. Dick's has more than 550 stores in 46 states . Let him in: In a complaint filed in Mercer County Court Feb. 20, Dick's Sporting Goods claims Modell visited one of its stores in Princeton on Feb. 8 and pretended to be a senior vice president of Dick's who was collecting information about the store . Lawsuit: Dick's is seeking unspecified financial compensation for damages, and a ruling that would bar Modell (pictured) or any of his employees from making future visits to the non-public areas of a Dick's store or using the information gained from Modell's February visit .","Dick's Sporting Goods chain alleges Mitchell Modell pretended to be an executive from a rival store to obtain secrets .

"A female teacher is facing aggravated sodomy and child molestation charges over the alleged indecent assault of a 15-year-old boy. Victoria Tatum, 24, was arrested at Newton County High School in Georgia on Thursday on felony charges and booked into jail without bond. Tatum, from Decatur, has been charged with two counts of aggravated child molestation, aggravated sodomy, and enticing a child. Victoria Tatum, 24, was arrested at Newton County High School in Georgia after allegedly engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old boy . A worried family member reported the relationship to police on Tuesday, according to the Rockdale Citizen. The math teacher, who is originally from Pennsylvania, was in her first year of teaching at the high school. It is not believed that any of the sexual molestation incidents took place on school grounds and have been going on for several weeks. It is believed that only one student was involved, police said on Thursday. Tatum was hired by Newton County Schools on July 28 this year. A criminal background check came back negative for charges at the time she was hired. The 24-year-old has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of both the Sheriff’s Office investigation as well as an internal investigation being conducted by the Newton County School System. In a statement to MailOnline today, Sherri Davis-Viniard, NCSS spokesperson, said: 'These are very serious charges.

Poster boy: Neymar fighting for the ball with Chile defender Mauricio Isla . Hulk: 6 . Dreadful mistake for Chile’s equaliser and a booking for that controversial disallowed goal. But terrific too at times. Fred: 5 . Missed what chances came to him and replaced midway through the second half by Jo. Says it all really. Disappointing: Fred had a disappointing game before being subbed off . CHILE . Claudio Bravo: 7 . Some mad moments but did his job, including some quite stunning saves. Gary Medel: 6 . Looked stretched at times but a courageous display by the Cardiff City man. Rock: Chile defender Gary Medel was excellent at the back . Francisco Silva: 6 . Did well, in partnership with Isla, to marshall Oscar. Gonzalo Jara: 6 . Picked up a booking that meant a suspension and struggled at times with Hulk’s strength and power. Mauricio Isla: 6 . Like Silva did a good job making like difficult for Brazil as a right-sided wing-back. Battler: Mauricio Isla challenging for the ball with Brazil's Neymar . Eugenio Mena: 6 . Booked and therefore also knew he would be out of the next game. But worked tirelessly. Marcelo Diaz: 6 . Coped well in the midfield battle zone against quality opposition. Arturo Vidal: 7 . What a good player the Juventus man is. Seemingly can play anywhere too. Acrobatic: Chile and Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal goes for a fly kick . Charles Aranguiz: 6 . Crunching tackle on Neymar in the opening exchanges. Eduardo Vargas: 7 . His ball for the equaliser was superb and defended from the front. Alexis Sanchez: 8 . Marvellous goal.

Brazil team doctor Jose Luiz Runco . said Neymar would be out for about six weeks and added: ‘He does not . have any neurological injury that would compromise his life as an . athlete or a human being. He will be able to pass, to run.’ Neymar thanked his team-mates for . their support in an emotional video recorded at the team’s . training ground before he was flown home to Guaruja by helicopter to . begin his rehabilitation. But Scolari knows the importance of . Neymar to the squad and has asked the 22-year-old to come to Belo . Horizonte and cheer the team on against Germany. ‘He will be with us if he can, on the . bench or in the stands,’ the former Chelsea manager said. ‘It all will . depend on how he is.’ As well as being without Neymar, . Scolari will probably have to replace Thiago Silva, who is unlikely to . win an appeal against his second booking of the tournament during the . 2-1 victory against Colombia on Friday.

But the biggest task for Scolari is . filling the gap left by Neymar, who was Brazil’s top scorer at the World . Cup with four goals. ‘It’s equivalent to a catastrophe,’ Scolari said. ‘Neymar is our reference. He is a player that would make . the difference in any team. We have lost the one player we did not want . to lose.’ The Brazilian federation confirmed . yesterday that team psychologist Regina Brandao would visit the training . ground after Scolari admitted he found the ordeal of seeing his best . player injured hard to take. ‘It was a big shock,’ he said. ‘The . image of Neymar being carried off a stretcher towards the plane, the . difficulties, the tears.’ But Bastian Schweinsteiger has warned Germany the injury to Neymar could galvanise Brazil. ‘We are all very sad Neymar can’t play,’ he said. ‘It is always best if all the big players are on the pitch for the big games. ‘But the loss of Neymar can create strength and weld together the Brazilian team.’","Neymar is out of the World Cup in Brazil after fracturing a vertebra .

"A couple who claimed to be so broke they had to borrow money from relatives ran up £1million in fraudulent debt and spent it on a fleet of Bentleys and Range Rovers. Jeremy Palmer, 53, and his wife Dawn, 50, from Dunton near Basildon in Essex managed to obtain a credit card in the name of an unwitting relative to rack up debt between 2002 and 2008. The couple, who pleaded not guilty, were jailed for a total of eight and a half years when they appeared at Blackfriars Crown Court yesterday following a seven-week trial. Jeremy Palmer, 53, (left), and his wife Dawn, 50, (right) ran up more than £1million in fraudulent debts, which they spent on three Range Rover Sports and two Bentleys . They had used the name of Mrs Palmer's innocent brother, Mark Waterhouse, to acquire credit and buy three Range Rover Sports and two Bentleys and take out massive overdrafts. The shocked 51-year-old from Chelmsford, Essex, said he felt 'abused' by his family's betrayal and has not spoken to his sister and brother-in-law since their arrest in 2011. He said: 'I was devastated; couldn't believe it.' 'I'm still shocked to be honest. I had helped them in the past when they had money troubles, they were always borrowing money. 'I feel totally abused. You don't expect this from your own family.' Mrs Palmer also claimed to earn more than £200,000 a year to secure further advances against the marital home in Brentwood Road, Dunton, using her maiden name. The couple, who lived in Brentwood Road in Dunton, Essex (pictured), now face eight and a half years in prison . The total amount of credit obtained and losses run up with the bank and on credit cards amounted to more than £1million. Mr Palmer was jailed for six years after he was convicted of 16 counts and his wife was found guilty of five counts and was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment. Essex Police spent three years investigating the couple's fraudulent activity. Detective Sergeant Danny Walker, investigating officer, said: 'This was a prolonged, multi-faceted series of fraud offences where advantage was taken of a member of their family. 'The motivation for these offences was pure greed and the money obtained was used to purchase cars and other items which otherwise they would not have been unable to afford. 'Their selfish crimes have caused damage to a family which no money or prison sentence can repair.'","Jeremy Palmer and his wife Dawn obtained credit card in name of relative .

"Chelsy Davy's love life has been subject to speculation recently following rumours her boyfriend, society jeweller Charles Goode, was set to pop the question. So it's no wonder her friends are keen to catch up with her to discover if she really is soon to become a Mrs. The former long-term girlfriend of Prince Harry was spotted confiding in a friend as they met for lunch in London's Notting Hill. No ring: Chelsy's engagement finger was bare as she met a friend for lunch . Chelsy, 28, has publicly denied she's engaged. Last month she told the Daily Mail's Sebastian Shakespeare: 'It's absolute rubbish - I'm definitely not engaged or even ready to get married.' True to her word, she did not have a ring on her engagement finger when she was spotted eating out today. Dressed casually in ripped black trousers and a faux fur animal print gillet, she wore her long blonde hair loose around her shoulders. As she shared a cigarette with her friend before their lunch arrived, Chelsy's face was animated in conversation. I'm not engaged! The former flame of Prince Harry has publicly denied reports she's due to walk down the aisle . Catching up: Chelsy met up with a friend in London's Notting Hill . She could have been filling her friend in on her holiday to Africa at the start of September, where it was thought Charles, 30, would go down on one knee. But as they are not yet to make their relationship more serious, some of her royalist fans hope she may one day rekindle her romance with the prince, 30. Solicitor Chelsy and Prince Harry had a seven year on-and-off relationship which saw the Zimbabwean beauty join him at many official events. However the couple called time on their relationship in 2011. Not ready to tie the knot yet: Chelsy with boyfriend Charles Goode . As they were: The solicitor and Prince Harry when they were an item in 2010 . According to friends, she decided she couldn't permanently live the life of a royal - particularly after seeing the intense public scrutiny the Duchess of Cambridge has been under since she became engaged to Prince William. The couple remain good friends though and are reported to keep in touch regularly by phone, while their paths also frequently cross at the society weddings of friends they share. While Chelsy has moved on to have a relationship with Charles, the prince had also found love again with Cressida Bonas. However, as with his experience with Chelsy, the pair have also had an on-off relationship. The couple were said to have split up in April but remain good friends.","Prince Harry's ex seen eating out with a friend .

"A father has been cleared of inflicting a catalogue of injuries on his baby daughter. A jury took just 20 minutes to find Martin Thomas, 30, not guilty of ten charges including grievous bodily harm with intent following a six-day trial at Liverpool Crown Court. As the judge announced each verdict, Mr Thomas became more emotional and by the time the tenth and final one was read out he was crying openly. Evie Grace Fisher-Thomas died aged just four months in February 2013. Her father was today acquitted of inflicting a catalogue of injuries on her . As he left the court room, however, Mr Thomas was approached by members of the public who had been in the public gallery and they shouted abuse at him. Evie Grace Fisher-Thomas tragically died aged just four months from causes unrelated to the charges facing Mr Thomas. But the father of two from Wigan, Greater Manchester, had to go through a trial accusing him of assaulting Evie Grace and leaving her with skull and rib fractures. A jury took just 20 minutes today to find Martin Thomas, 30, not guilty of ten charges including grievous bodily harm with intent to his daughter, Evie Grace who died aged just four months of a respiratory illness . Hayley Fisher holds her daughter Evie Grace who died aged four months in February. Miss Fisher's boyfriend Martin Thomas was today acquitted of 10 charges relating to injuries suffered by the baby . After being found not guilty today he spoke out about undergoing almost two years of hell including physical attacks and an attempt at suicide. Martin Thomas, 30, was acquitted of attacking his four-month-old daughter Evie Grace . He said the ordeal had left him afraid to leave his home and cost him his job at Heinz's plant in Kitt Green but he now hoped to put the trial behind him and grieve properly for Evie. Mr Thomas said: 'I was very emotional when the judge read out the verdict. 'The security woman said I was free to go so I left the court straight away. 'It's all such a big relief. All I ever wanted to do and set out to do was prove my innocence and now I have done that. 'I've been beaten up on the street and called names and for the last 20 months I've been stuck in the house. I had to leave my job and I've been suicidal, I tried taking my own life. 'You just wouldn't believe how much of a weight off my shoulders it actually is. 'No one can ever imagine or come close to imagining how I've felt unless they go through it themselves. 'I can now finally walk around the streets without looking over my shoulder and I can actually grieve properly for my daughter without any stress on my back.' Treacher Collins syndrome is named after Edward Treacher Collins (1862–1932), an English surgeon and ophthalmologist who first described it in 1900. It is a rare disorder found in about 1 in 50,000 births. It is characterised by a small lower jaw, downward-slanting eyes, hearing loss, drooping lower eyelids and malformed or absent ears. Some individuals may be so mildly affected, they remain undiagnosed; others can have severe facial deformities, which can be life-threatening if the airway is blocked. Mr Thomas was found not guilty of inflicting injuries to Evie's skull and ribs following the trial, which he said was a harrowing experience as it forced him to relive every detail of his daughter's life. Evie, who suffered from the rare condition Treacher Collins syndrome, died on February 21, 2013 from respiratory failure while sleeping at home with her parents, Mr Thomas and his girlfriend Hayley Fisher. Mr Thomas also criticised people who had used online sites such as Facebook and Twitter in the time since his arrest to post abusive or unpleasant messages about him, but says he now just wants to put the ordeal behind him. He said: 'The trial was awful. It went through everything that happened, the accident, the day Evie actually passed away, everything was brought back up. 'I have to say social media hasn't helped one little bit, seeing people's ideas, views and opinions. I just want everyone to be aware of the verdict and that I was found not guilty. 'I'm now going to try my best to just move forward and go back to work. I can now go out with friends as I've not been able to do that, I was scared of people thinking I had done something. Now I don't have to worry about that. 'I can put it all behind me the best I can.'","Daughter Evie Grace died aged just four months in February 2013 .

"Manchester United have unveiled their new kit for the 2014/15 season. England striker Wayne Rooney was at the centre of the photo, flanked by Old Trafford team-mates Robin van Persie and Shinji Kagawa. The collarless shirt, designed by Nike, features white on the sleeves and a hint of black, and marks the first strip released during Louis van Gaal's tenure of the Old Trafford club. The traditional white collar returns for the new campaign, while the words 'youth, courage and greatness' are embossed in the neck of the shirt.

Commenting on Van Gaal's decision to replace goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen with Tim Krul ahead of Holland's successful penalty-shootout win over Costa Rica, De Boer said: 'It was a genius move. Van Gaal is the best coach I ever worked with. He is the best chance for a team to have success. 'Nobody really believed in this Holand team, but I said, ""if one man can change this team, it is Louis van Gaal"". It is the same for Manchester United.' Speaking to talkSPORT, De Boer added: 'Sometimes you need a bit of luck, of course, like we have had in this tournament and it will be the same at Manchester United. 'In the long term you will have success with him, but do you have the patience? He could win the Premier League title, or maybe the Champions League, but it is not really realistic, of course.'

"Murdered police officer Bryson Anderson’s family honours the man who was a much-loved husband and father of three. After many months of denial, Fiona Barbieri, 47, and her 21-year-old son Mitchell cried and hugged in the dock as they prepared to plea to their roles in the death of Detective Inspector Anderson on December 6, 2012 as they were due to stand trial at the NSW Supreme Court on Wednesday. Almost two years after he was stabbed to death in the neighbourhood dispute, Bryson’s widow Donna Anderson and their three children Olivia, Darcy and Cain could not wipe the smiles off their faces when they told fond stories of how Bryson was always the larrikin of the family. Scroll down for video . Bryson Anderson with his wife Donna and children from left to right - Darcy, Cain and Olivia . Detective Inspector Bryson Anderson was killed while trying to calm a neighbourhood dispute in 2012 . Fiona Barbieri, 47, and her 21-year-old son Mitchell cried and hugged in the dock as they prepared to plea to their roles in the death of Detective Inspector Anderson . Mitchell pleaded guilty to the officer's murder, while his mother pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of substantial impairment. The 21-year-old now faces a mandatory life sentence for murdering a police officer in the course of his duty. Justice has been served for the family of slain police officer Anderson, but the emotional scars still remain for them and will do for some time to come. Donna spoke to Channel Nine's ACA about the two very different sides to her husband who was stabbed to death after attending a neighbourhood dispute in Oakville in north west Sydney. ‘There was the policeman side to him which was incredibly serious – he took his job very seriously -but there was the family side of him where he was just the clown in every family gathering,’ she said. Bryson's family described him as a joker who had a great sense of humour . His wife Donna said her husband absolutely adored their three children . Olivia, Cain and Darcy could not speak highly enough of their deceased father . Despite working in a stressful and demanding job in the police force for 26 years, Bryson always had the time for his children. ‘He just absolutely adored his kids,’ she said. ‘He was a typical dad - he loved dad jokes and if he could embarrass the kids in front of their friends that was even better.’ His three children could not speak highly enough of their father. ‘He would totally just love life - it was awesome,’ his only daughter Olivia said. ‘Yes, he liked to embarrass us.’ His eldest son, Darcy said he was a great dad who was always a joker. ‘He photo bombed a lot – my first cricket game in my photo – he was in the background,’ he said. ‘Cricket is my life – me and dad built the pitch out the front in 2003 I think.’ ‘We got tonnes of dirt and just rolled it and got it all padded down and I just keep mowing it in.’ 'He was always a joker – he photo-bombed a lot,' his youngest son Cain said. While being dedicated to his family and career, he also managed to squeeze in volunteering with the Special Olympics, travelling to Vanuatu to give gifts to children and also volunteering as a firefighter. ‘He would come home from the police sometimes he would only be there for an hours or so and then the bells would go off and he would go out to a fire call and he did that for nine years,’ Donna said. Bryson's only daughter Olivia said her father had a great love for life . Darcy loves cricket so much that his father helped build him a cricket pitch in their front yard . Youngest son Cain said his father was always a joker who 'photo-bombed a lot' But reminiscing on old funny stories will never take away the pain of losing their beloved father. Detective Inspector Anderson's family said his killers' guilty pleas have brought them closer to the formal conclusion of the case. But privately they continue to struggle with their loss, and it will be some time before they finally come to terms with the tragedy. Speaking outside court, Detective Inspector Anderson's brother, Warwick, was flanked by police officers. 'Today we are relieved that the events have brought us closer to a resolution of the public phase of this matter,' he said. 'Privately there is still a significant way to go for our family as we try to come to terms with the senseless and tragic loss of Bryson.' He said his family's 'thoughts, care and prayers' were with the colleagues who continued to suffer physical and psychological injuries as a result of his brother's death. While dedicated to his family and career, he also managed to volunteer with the Special Olympics . Bryson also loved travelling to Vanuatu to give gifts to the local children . Bryson volunteered as a firefighter for nine years while also working as a police officer . During the committal hearing last year, a number of police officers broke down as they recalled the murder. The court heard the officers were called to the Barbieris' Oakville property in Sydney's west following reports of a neighbourhood dispute. Detective Inspector Anderson was killed while trying to calm the dispute. Police were called to the property after neighbours complained about arrows being fired into their yard from a cross-bow. Over the next two hours, 11 police who attended the scene were forced to take refuge behind a cordon as they fought off abuse, arrows, angry dogs and other weapons while trying to bring the situation to a peaceful resolution. Detective Inspector Anderson, 45, died after he was attacked and stabbed during the stand-off that ensued. At officer Anderson's 2012 funeral, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said the decorated officer was greatly admired by his fellow officers . The family privately continue to struggle with their loss, and it will be some time before they finally come to terms with the tragedy . Anderson always showed 'initiative and leadership; intelligence and perseverance' Constable Hannah Watson said she remembered seeing Mitchell Barbieri strike officer Anderson but thought the senior officer had just been punched. Constable Ryan Mitchell told the court last year: 'When I saw there was a significant amount of blood on my colleagues, I knew what had happened was very serious.' At Detective Inspector Anderson's 2012 funeral, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said the decorated officer was admired by his fellow officers for his tenacity and determination, as well as his empathy and compassion. 'He showed initiative and leadership; intelligence and perseverance; dedication and humility; and, memorably, a ready smile and an engaging way. 'Bryson drew people to him, without guile and without effort.' The Barbieris will return to court on November 12.

"Human remains found on a remote Alaska island have been identified as those of a missing French adventurer, Alaska State Troopers said. Francois Guenot, 32, dubbed 'the crazy Frenchman', vanished in May after embarking on a kayaking trip, Alaska Dispatch News  reported. His destination was Perryville, a small community hundreds of miles away from Kokhanok on the Alaska Peninsula. The remains of the 32-year-old man were found in September on Shuyak Island north of Kodiak. The state medical examiner's office identified the remains using dental records, troopers said Wednesday. Mystery: Francois Guenot was last seen in Kohanok on the Alaska Peninsula and planned to kayak hundreds of miles to Perryville. Remains found on Shuhak Island in September have been identified as his body . Guenot, from Maiche, France, began appearing last year in southwest Alaska villages. He told people he had walked, canoed and bicycled across Canada and through Alaska, and planned to reach Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. He was last seen in early May near Kokhanok and friends last heard from him late that month, when he was near Kamishak Bay, on the coast of Katmai National Park and Preserve. A kayak believed to be Guenot's was found by Katmai park rangers in June, and a waterproof bag was found 3 miles away. The kayak contained identification, food and maps, as well as an array of personal journals, according to rangers at the park, which is home to Alaskan brown bears. His last journal entry was dated June 15. The Coast Guard launched a brief search of the area but found no sign of the missing man. Guenot's father and brother arrived in Alaska in August to press authorities to continue searching. They reasoned that survival items such as a compass, tarp and knife were not among the items found. A volunteer cleaning up marine debris on the beach at Shuyak Island found the remains, which were wearing a rain jacket, chest waders and gloves. Wilderness: The 32-year-old's red-and-white kayak, containing his possessions, was discovered on a beach along Shelikof Strait off Cape Douglas (pictured), around 200 miles south-west of Anchorage, in June . Mr Guenot, who worked as a ski instructor in Maiche, had spent more than two years trekking across Canada before venturing to Alaska. He arrived in Canada in the summer of 2011 to begin his trek across North America, which included several misadventures, including falling into a river in the winter. He eventually made his way to Fairbanks, where he found a bike at the dump and rode it to Homer, before venturing to Seldovia, where he found two kayaks and made them into one seaworthy vessel. In . January . 2012, he told Yukon News that he dreamed of adventure in the wilds of Canada and Alaska, . saying: 'I don't want to stay like a dog on a leash in France.' Treacherous: The adventurer is believed to have been making his way from Kokhanok to Perryville. Katmai National Park ranger Wendy Artz said the land between the two villages in home to more bears than people . After showing up in south-west Alaska, Mr Guenot befriended Kokhanok resident Gary Nielsen and lived on his property in a tent. When it was too cold to sleep outside, Mr Nielsen said the explorer - who earned his nickname based on his ultimate goal to reach the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia - would sleep in a steam bath. He added that Mr Guenot had set off in May, telling him that he was going to Perryville, but had seemed to have trouble comprehending the great distances involved in travelling Alaska. Earlier this year, the adventurer had spent three weeks walking around Lake Iliamna during spring break up, but somehow came back in one piece, he said. Meanwhile, another of Mr Guenot's friends, Jim Tilley of Intricate Bay, said many locals were concerned about him, telling the Daily News: 'He was just aloof to the dangers of Alaska.' Mr Neilsen said Mr Guenot had been planning to meet up with friends on July 19 when he vanished. 'If we hear nothing by the end of July, he's probably dead,' he added.","Francois Guenot, 32, vanished as he explored Alaskan wilderness in May .

"Labour’s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves raised the issue with French government ministers in Paris this week . Britain is handing out £600,000 every week in child benefits to European immigrants whose children live abroad. The most recent figures show that 20,400 families received payments for a total of 34,268 children, setting back taxpayers £31million a year – or some £600,000 every week. A detailed breakdown of the figures revealed that nearly two-thirds of the children are in Poland, with payments for 22,093 youngsters going to the eastern European country. Of the rest, 1,231 families in Ireland get cash for 2,505 children, while 1,215 families in Lithuania, 797 in Latvia and 789 in France also benefit. Children living abroad receive the same amount of money as those in the UK – even if they have never set foot here – despite the cost of living being much lower in many other countries. Migrants working here claim the UK money rather than use equivalent schemes at home as the handouts are much more generous. Parents receive £20.50 a week for their first child and £13.55 for any further children in Britain. By contrast, the Polish government pays out £13.60 a week for children under five, £18.20 for children aged 5-18 and £19.60 for those aged 18-24 in education. The figures were uncovered by Labour – who accused David Cameron of ‘giving up’ on reform to EU benefit rules and attacking the payment of child benefit abroad as ‘unfair and not affordable’. Labour’s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves raised the issue with French government ministers in Paris this week. She said: ‘David Cameron’s government seems to have given up any effort to end the scandal of millions of pounds of child benefit being sent abroad every year. ‘Rather than admitting defeat the Prime Minister should be ordering his ministers to work with governments across the European Union to bear down on this abuse of our benefits system. ‘People who work hard and pay in to the social security system are right to be angry when they see child benefit being sent abroad. ‘It’s unfair and it’s not affordable. That’s why I have raised this important issue with French government ministers this week. If the Tory-led government continues to fail to act over millions in child benefit being sent abroad each year, a Labour government will.’ Miss Reeves will also meet a series of ministers from other EU countries to argue for an end to what she called ‘abuse’ of the child benefit system . Miss Reeves will also meet a series of ministers from other EU countries to argue for an end to what she called ‘abuse’ of the child benefit system. Earlier this year David Cameron admitted changes to the rules will have to wait until after the 2015 election. He said: ‘Today if you travel and work from another European country into Britain, you can then claim child benefit and other benefits for your family back at home even though actually they’re not living in the UK and going to UK schools and all the rest of it. ‘And under the current rules, it seems extremely difficult, if not impossible, to change that. ‘Now I haven’t met anybody who thinks this is sensible … so that is again a really big change.’ However, when in opposition, the Tories pledged to change the rules so the controversial payments would cease. The party’s then Treasury spokesman Philip Hammond said: ‘It beggars belief that Gordon Brown is continuing to send millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to children who don’t even live in this country.’ The number of families claiming benefits for children living abroad has fallen slightly in the past two years by 3,682. But recent changes to child benefit rules mean that families in Britain where one parent earns more than £60,000 a year do not receive any child benefit, and the money is cut on a sliding scale for those earning between £50,000 and £60,000. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘As the Prime Minister has made clear, we need to change the rules around paying child benefit in respect of children who live in other European countries. 'We need a change of EU law to do this, which is why the Government is pursuing renegotiation of the relevant EU rules with our European counterparts.’","UK handing out £31m a year - £600,000 every week - to European immigrants .

"Authorities say the last one of the 13 teenagers who escaped from a youth detention center in Nashville is back in custody. Metropolitan Nashville Police say the 16-year-old Timothy B. Willis was located early Sunday by an officer on patrol. The Tennessee Department of Children's Services says in a statement that Willis and 12 other teens overpowered a guard late Friday, taking his keys to open a door at the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center. Timothy B. Willis, a 16-year-old with a record including charges for theft, assault, and being a runaway, was busted Sunday a little more than one day after escaping a youth detention center . According to the Tennessean, one managed to squeeze out through an opening between the rolling gate and perimeter fence. That boy was able to throw a rock through the guard house window on the opposite side, then open the gate and let the rest free. The statement says police located all but Willis within hours. The 12 youth back in custody were taken to a juvenile court detention center. The breach was the third major disturbance reported in recent weeks at the center. In that case, the teens escaped by kicking through the dorm walls and shimmying underneath a weak spot in the perimeter fence. Two juveniles from a Sept. 1 escape remain at large. Several of those who participated in this most recent attempt were also part of previous escapes. Repeat offenders may be transferred to a new facility. The state department of corrections may also transfer extra guards to the facility. The facility generally houses teens with at least three felonies on their records, spokesman Rob Johnson told the Tennessean. The Tennessee Department of Children's Services says in a statement that thirteen teens overpowered a guard late Friday, taking his keys to open a door at the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center . Officials say the boys tried to convince the facility's 52 other inmates to follow them out. 'We believe the students tried to get other youth to join in, but they refused,' a statement from authorities said. Two of the 14 staff members working during the escape sustained minor injuries. 'Aside from calling for help on a radio, the guards have few methods to control the youth,' the statement read. 'They do not have weapons or pepper spray.' Children's Services officials and police didn't immediately answer Associated Press calls for details Saturday. The department said 52 other teens at Woodland Hills remained securely held. Authorities are asking that anyone with information on the whereabouts of Willis call 862-8600.","Timothy B.

"James Rodriguez won the battle of the No 10s, but it is Neymar's Brazil who live to fight another World Cup day. In the most bruising of all the encounters at these finals – 54 fouls is a record – it was hardly the setting for the tournament poster boys to shine. But while Neymar showed flashes, Rodriguez burned brightly. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Neymar arrive at hospital as his World Cup dream is crushed . In the shadow: Neymar failed to outperform James Rodriguez but Brazil were 2-1 winners over Colombia . Bugged: Not even a giant insect could distract Rodriguez as he converted from the penalty spot . Pain game: Neymar, tended to by Rodriguez, left the field on a stretcher with a back injury . He created the opening for Colombia to win their late penalty and duly kept his cool to convert from the spot, despite the presence of a giant bug on his shoulder. Rodriguez, though, had bugged Brazil throughout. He recovered from each attempt to maim his frame – Fernandinho the chief culprit – and was the heartbeat of his side’s forward forays. Brazil were already two goals to the good - Thiago Silva and David Luiz on target - by the time Rodriguez’s sixth goal of the finals halved the deficit with 11 minutes remaining and, try as he might, a deserved equaliser eluded the Monaco star. Neymar, who had assisted Silva’s early opener, did eventually fall foul amid the rough stuff and, after Juan Zuniga’s knee landed in the small of his back, he left the field in tears on a stretcher. It later emerged that Neymar had broken a vertebrae in his back. His World Cup is over, as is Rodriguez’s. Both of them will be sorely missed. Here, Sportsmail runs you through the most anticipated head-to-head of the finals so far... Danger: Rodriguez's heat map demonstrates the pockets he was populating . Hot: Neymar's involvement was not as concentrated but he still got on the ball in good areas . Head-to-head: Neymar and Rodriguez's stats compared . On the front foot: How did they compare in the final third? Clock watch: Neymar versus James Rodriguez . 3min – The pair have to wait three minutes for an involvement of note and on players find team-mates with ease – nerve-settlers, if they needed them that is. 4min – Neymar sizes a free-kick 25 yards out but, despite beating the Colombia wall, his effort also evades the target and drifts harmlessly wide. He is human, after all. 7min – GOAL: Brazil 1 Colombia 0 – Neymar wins the corner and takes the corner from which skipper Thiago Silva bundles home from close range. That’s his first assist of the finals, although to be fair he’s scored most of Brazil’s goals. Lucky charm: Neymar receives a kiss from the player escort before the game . Flying: Neymar enjoyed a bright start to the game but faded as the first half wore on . 12min – Neymar is at the heart of everything and, after skipping clear of a red shirt on halfway, he attempts to spring the front-running Maicon clear but the pass is intercepted, just. 14min – Rodriguez has seen precious little of the ball but when he finally does he’ll probably be wishing he hadn’t, Brazil’s Fernandinho upending him after a hefty challenge on the halfway-line. A little reducer from the Manchester City enforcer. Marked man: Rodriguez feels the force of Fernandinho's challenge again . 20min – Neymar delivers another pair of teasing flag-kicks but this time Colombia are alert to the danger and clear. 21min – Rodriguez escapes down the left and steals a yard for the cross but his final ball is poor and is hacked clear at the near post. 22min – Rodriguez shows his class with a mazy run and neat pass but Juan Cuadrado fails to match his comrade’s enterprise and his contribution comes to nothing. The No.10 is just starting to work his way into the game. Eventually: Rodriguez escapes his minders but it comes to nothing . 31min – It has been break-neck stuff and, amid the frenzy, Neymar’s radar has malfunctioned as he is guilty of a couple of wayward passes. We can forgive him that, though. 37min – Rodriguez takes an age to measure a free-kick 20 yards out but his curler is blocked by two yellow shirts who broke suspiciously early from the wall. 42min – Colombia are still to fashion a real chance and Rodriguez is again let down by his team-mates having drove forward and found Ibarbo on the left, who miscontrolled. 44min – Neymar wriggles free of his minder on the fringe of the penalty area and is duly impeded, winning a free-kick which he curls wide of Ospina’s goal. Replays show it wasn’t as close as the Brazilian’s pained expression had suggested. Same again? Rodriguez had shaped to repeat his wonder goal from the last 16 but instead teed up a team-mate . HALF-TIME: Brazil 1 Colombia 0 . 47min – Neymar showboats inside the Colombia half with an outrageous piece of skill to evade his man but then beats himself with a step-over too many and possession is lost. It’s been that sort of night for him. 50min – With shades of Johan Cruyff, Rodriguez buys himself two yards of space 25 yards from goal but rather than shoot elects to play in Armero only for his through-ball to deflect into the grateful arms of Julio Cesar. 55mins – Neymar continues to be careless with his distribution and another pass goes astray. 63min – It’s Neymar’s turn to feel the force of some heavy treatment as Cuadrado sends his crashing to the turf on the left-wing. Neymar dusts himself off to deliver a lofted free-kick to the far post but Ospina claims. The delivery had too much height on, if anything. 67min – Rodriguez sees yellow for a sliding challenge which fells Hulk and the Colombian makes a point – quite rightly – of reminding the referee of the five fouls committed on himself which went unpunished. Fall guy: Rodriguez's foul on Hulk led to Brazil's second goal . 68min – GOAL: Brazil 2 Colombia 0 – And from the resulting free-kick David Luiz steps up to dispatch an absolute stunner into the top corner, all but booking the hosts’ place in the last four. Rodriguez and Co contest the award of the free-kick but it matters not. 73min – Neymar wants in on the act but the measurements of his carefully-designed curler are slightly out and the ball drifts wide with Ospina scrambling. 77min – Neymar kills dead a ball dropping from the sky just inside the area but within a split-second Mario Yepes is on him and snuffs out the danger. 78min – Rodriguez is the architect as his slick through-ball frees Bacca and the substitute is upended by the on-rushing Julio Cesar, who escapes a red card but concedes a penalty. 79min – GOAL: Brazil 2 Colombia 1 – And it is Rodriguez who takes responsibility and nonchalantly rolls the ball into the bottom corner for his sixth of the tournament. Spot on: Rodriguez rolls home his sixth of the tournament . 84min – Brazil are clinging on and, with Neymar missing, it’s Rodriguez taking centre stage as his side chase what had seemed an unlikely equaliser. 86min – Neymar is left in a heap after Zuniga’s knee thunders into his back and that’s enough to end his evening, the forward leaving the action in tears and on a stretcher. Crying shame: Neymar is in tears as he is stretchered from the action . 90min – Rodriguez has to be careful otherwise he could be following Neymar down the tunnel, the Colombia man barging Marcelo off the ball at the expense of a free-kick and then arguing his cause a little too forcefully with the referee. 93min – Rodriguez serves up another whipped corner but Zuniga’s header skips wide and Brazil survive.

And the former drug cheat admitted his career could have been over had the race not gone to plan. 'It is just such a relief; there is a lot of young potential out there,' Chambers said. 'I was running for my life. Any one of those guys could have got me, everyone raises their intensity, so I knew I had to raise my performance too and fortunately I did it.

I would have had to seriously review my situation.' Aikines-Aryeetey's second place also booked his spot for Zurich, with Ujah having to rely on the discretion of the selectors for the third spot. On his race, Ujah said: 'I came here to win, but unfortunately, it was a matter of putting three races together. I got cramp on the very first step (in the final) and experience won today.' James Dasaolu, who ran 9.91 here last year, missed the event this time around through injury and so could miss out on selection for the Europeans, having also failed to make England's Commonwealth Games team.

"At Manchester United, they were calling him 'Mandela' by the end, such . was the young man's act of insubordination towards manager Sir Alex . Ferguson. It certainly was not an oversight that Paul Pogba's . name barely earned a mention in Ferguson's recent autobiography. Ferguson's silence spoke volumes. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pogba perform outrageous freestyle skills . Influence: France midfielder Paul Pogba challenges Nigeria's forward Victor Moses . Pogba did not challenge racial divisions and he will not have stadiums or museums named after him as the great South African Nelson Mandela did but his uncompromising defiance of a repressive manager spoke loud in the United dressing-room. They knew this was a player that should be taken seriously. On the BBC on Monday evening, Rio Ferdinand revealed an anecdote that provided an insight into the confidence, bordering on arrogance, of this young footballer: 'He told me minutes before he left ""I want to be the best player in the world."" I don't know if he'll be the best player in the world, but I think he'll definitely turn out to be the best midfielder in the world.' The story is well-told by now but United refused to offer the terms that Pogba and perhaps more crucially, his agent Mino Raiola, demanded. It was not money alone that decided Pogba's decision. Command: Pogba produced another imperious performance against Nigeria . He simply felt that United did not believe in him, a view confirmed on a . New Years Eve in 2012. United were crippled by an injury crisis but . victory should still have been relatively straightforward against . Blackburn of the Steve Kean incarnation. As it . transpired, United lost the match 3-2 at Old Trafford. Ferguson selected . a strange midfield, choosing Park Ji-Sung and Rafael Da Silva in the . central midfield positions. One week later, Paul Scholes had been . invited to come out of retirement. Pogba never did start a game for the . club. Speak to those at Old Trafford and they now recognise a . gross error of misjudgement, although it should be said that those . voices were rather less dissenting at the time. The tone eighteen months . ago was one that reproached a young upstart for questioning the . knowledge of Ferguson. Now, however, there can be no . arguments. Pogba is making the greatest British manager of all-time . appear rather foolish. Ferguson's refusal to offer him the wage package . he desired can be filed in the calamity catalogue that wears labels such . as 'Taibi', 'Djemba-Djemba' and 'Prunier'. Once again . for France on Monday evening, Pogba served notice of his status as the . planet's most complete young midfielder. He is only 6 foot 2 inches but . he seems taller, wider and stronger. In domineering form at this World . Cup, he has towered across the global football landscape, a tackler that . turns 50/50's into 80/20's and a midfield beast allaying flawless . technique with a brutal physique. One French newspaper . last year described him as an 'NBA athlete with Brazilian feet'. Pogba . is dancing to the Samba beat in Brazil, taking on opponents, shoving . them aside with a scornful disregard as he drives his team-mates up the . pitch. Focus: Pogba headed home after Nigeria keeper Vincent Enyeama flapped at a cross . Up for it: Pogba celebrates scoring the first goal against Nigeria . It is why Juventus feel within their right to request a fee . beyond £60million before they even begin negotiating with clubs such as . Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester United this summer. They see . something in Pogba that goes beyond the norm, a truly special . footballer. Those at United saw a leader with fierce . determination in Pogba and anybody that has witnessed the French team at . this World Cup will have identified the Juventus midfielder as an . obvious candidate for the national team captaincy in years to come.

"Thomas Samuel posted five images of 'revenge porn' online then invited the victim's friends and family to view them . A jilted boyfriend who posted 'jaw-dropping' revenge porn online and attracted more than 50,000 views has escaped a jail sentence. Thomas Samuel, 45, posted the explicit pictures of his ex after a bitter break-up and shared them with the victim's family and friends. But despite Facebook removing the pictures within hours, they were shared and ended up on pornographic websites. Samuel admitted sending a communication conveying indecent images and said he had acted in spite after the girl posted 'unsavoury' details about him online. He was handed six months behind bars, suspended for two years. The woman told Bristol Magistrates' Court: 'They have caused me massive embarrassment and huge stress to me and my family.' She added she was constantly in fear of seeing him again and was also consumed by the knowledge that many people in the community where she lives were aware of the pictures. The court heard the pictures were first uploaded to Facebook after the couple argued following their split in March this year. Samuel claimed he took the steps after his partner circulated details about him on the site which he did not like. Before creating a spoof profile Samuel sent his ex-girlfriend a number of text messages, warning her not to tell other people their business. Scroll down for video . One read: 'I see you like telling everyone our business. You won't mind if I share a few photos with your friends.' While another said: 'As we are sharing info with everyone, I will share your favourite photos.' Samuel, of Lawrence Hill, Bristol, then sent 15 to 20 friends requests from the spoof account to various people she knew of. A couple of hours later, the former partner started receiving calls from family and friends telling her what had appeared on a Facebook page bearing her name. One friend, who accepted the request, said she saw a number of 'extremely explicit' pictures of the woman performing a sex act and other photos of a similar nature. She described the pictures as 'jaw-dropping'. Thomas Samuel, left, avoided prison after his six month sentence was suspended for two years . Samuel was also given a restraining order prohibiting him from contacting his former partner . Facebook was made aware of the account and the profile was taken down within two hours. But the court heard the pictures had remained online and, after putting her own name into a search engine, she found the pictures on pornographic websites. She discovered one picture had been viewed 48,000 times. The woman said the pictures had been taken on Samuel's Samsung phone when the two were together. Bridget Sanger, defending Samuel, said the situation was 'entirely regrettable' and the full consequences 'were not foreseen'. She said that Samuel had uploaded the pictures 'as a last resort' to stop abuse he was getting as a result of damaging comments put online by his ex-partner. The court heard that Samuel, who has done community work, youth work and charity work, lost his job when his employers found out about the case. Robert Stacey, chairman of the bench, said the offence crossed the custody threshold, and he would have to give Samuel a prison sentence. But he suspended the sentence and also made him subject to a restraining order prohibiting him from contacting his former partner. Samuel was ordered to undertake 180 hours of community work, pay court costs of £86 and pay a victim surcharge of £80. Victims of revenge porn have rarely been able to access justice as the term is not deemed a crime under Home Office classifications. On rare occasions, police have been able to press charges when the suspect's behaviour has encroached onto other legal territory - for example, blackmailing a victim or when the images are of children. Legislation, most of which pre-dates social media such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, means prosecutions could be brought under the Communications Act 2003, Malicious Communications Act 1988 and the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act. But a rise in the awareness of revenge pornography, partly due to high profile cases featuring celebrities, has seen politicians and campaign groups push for new laws covering revenge porn. In July, David Cameron backed proposals to make posting revenge porn online illegal, acknowledging in the Commons it 'clearly has criminal intent'. In September, Labour MP Geraint Davies proposed that people who are complicit in the distribution of revenge porn be prosecuted. Speaking ahead of the presentation of his Bill, Mr Davies said: 'It's a massive issue. People think they can take pictures and push them out for people's titillation but clearly it's causing a lasting, permanent harm and distress to people. 'People need to know the law is on their side and it should not be tolerated. Clearly there will be some that get through the net due to the difficulty of pursuing the case, but that's not a reason to fail to protect the innocent from abuse.' The Criminal Justice and Courts Bill is expected to have its Report Stage in the House of Lords on October 20. After that, there will be Third Reading in the Lords before returning to the House of Commons for consideration of amendments. Only then would it go for Royal Assent and become law.","Thomas Samuel posted 'jaw-dropping' photos online as revenge porn .

"It is one of football's most iconic images - Diego Maradona taking on the Belgians as he tried to conquer the world. Such was the danger Maradona posed to the Belgian goal during this Group 3 match in Barcelona during the 1982 World Cup, it seems they've put six men on him. But all is not what it seems. The photograph is wonderful - Maradona in his pomp, unafraid to take on all-comers - but it is rather misleading. Iconic: The famous photograph of Diego Maradona appearing to take on half the Belgian team at the 1982 World Cup . JUNE 13, 1982 - FIFA WORLD CUP, GROUP 3NOU CAMP, BARCELONA (ATT: 95,000) Argentina: Fillol, Galvan, Olguin, Passarella (c), Tarantini, Ardiles, Bertoni, Gallego, Maradona, Diaz (Valdano 63), Kempes . Belgium: Pfaff, Gerets (c), Millecamps, Baecke, De Schrijver, Vercauteren, Coeck, Ceulemans, Vandersmissen, Vandenburgh, Czerniatynski . Scorer: Vandenburgh 62 . The Belgian rearguard action is not Maradona's markers, it is actually a defensive wall to an Argentinean free-kick that has splintered. We are less than a minute into the second half at the Nou Camp, the score is still goalless and Maradona has won his team a free-kick, with Luc Millecamps earning himself a yellow card for the foul. It's too far out to attempt a shot but Ossie Ardiles has the chance to put the ball into a dangerous area. Maradona lurks 10 yards away from the wall and the video of the moment shows them frantically gesturing for someone to pick up the dangerman. Ardiles takes a short free-kick to Maradona and it's at this point the wall breaks up and starts to hunt down the ball. On the attack: Diego Maradona carries the ball forward into the Belgian half as Argentina search for the breakthrough in their opening match of the 1982 World Cup . Tripped: Maradona is brought to ground by the Belgian defender Luc Millecamps, prompting referee Vojtech Christov to award a free-kick . In the book: The referee also booked Millecamps for the foul, barely a minute into the second half . Mark him! Players in the Belgian wall frantically urge one of their colleagues to mark Maradona, who is stood about 10 yards away from the wall as Ossie Ardiles prepares to take the free-kick . Rolling ball: Ardiles strokes the ball to Maradona, who has still not been picked up . The moment: As Maradona takes in the ball with his left foot, the wall splinters and looks towards him. It is at this point the famous photograph is taken . The famous photograph is taken just as Maradona cushions the ball with his left foot, the eyes of the six players in the wall all trained towards him. It is taken in the split second before Ardiles runs through the cluster of Belgian players because no other Argentine players are in shot. Maradona tries to return the ball to Ardiles but the danger is snuffed out by the alert Millecamps. Nowhere to go: Maradona tries to pick a pass to Ardiles, who has run through the cluster of Belgian players . Snuffed out: But Maradona is unable to find a teammate and the swarming Belgian defence manage to clear the ball . Cleared: The danger passes as Belgium get the ball away. They go on to win the match 1-0 . Tight squeeze: Lionel Messi surrounded by six South Korean players at the 2010 World Cup in an echo of the famous Maradona photo . So this spectacular photograph is a trick. The perfect angle and the perfect timing to show one of the greatest ever players at his swaggering best. Belgium went on to win the match 1-0, Erwin Vandenbergh scoring the winner on 62 minutes. Both advanced from the group. They are set to meet again in Brasilia in the quarter-finals of the World Cup on Saturday, with Lionel Messi playing the role of Maradona.

"A mother has been left devastated after a 12-week scan revealed her unborn baby already faces a fight for survival - because his heart is growing outside of his body. Samantha Kerr, 33, was delighted when she became pregnant just months after a miscarriage. But the excitement soon turned to worry after her 12 week scan showed the baby boy's heart protruding from his chest. The baby has been diagnosed with ectopia cordis, an extremely rare condition which affects just eight in one million births. Mrs Kerr was devastated when her 12 week scan revealed her baby was growing with his heart protruding from his chest. She has decided not to have an abortion and has named her son Gabriel, which means 'miracle' The baby has been diagnosed with ectopia cordis, an extremely rare condition which affects just eight in one million births. The condition can cause the heart to be located anywhere from the neck to the lower abdomen, although in most cases it protrudes outside the chest through a fracture in the breastbone . Despite the problems ahead Mrs Kerr and husband Dennis, 34, of Maidstone, Kent, have rejected an abortion and Mrs Kerr is determined to have her son. A mother-of-two already, she  has already named the child Gabriel, as it means miracle. But doctors have warned his chances of survival are slim, with 90 per cent of babies with the condition are stillborn or die within three days. Even if Gabriel does survive he faces dozens of operations to rebuild his chest, which have only proved successful for a few babies in the past. Mrs Kerr, a teaching assistant, said: 'We were given the decision to terminate the pregnancy or continue with it, whatever we decided it was going to be heart-breaking. 'He is moving around and is as alive as he can be and for that reason I didn't want to take a decision on his future into my own hands. We just wanted to give him the chance. 'We were told it is a very high risk pregnancy and there are concerns as to whether the baby will make it. 'There are not that many success stories and that's why we are praying for a miracle.' Mrs Kerr and binman Dennis, who married last Saturday, are nervously anticipating the due date of April 17 but have been told they need to wait to see how the baby develops in the coming weeks. In the 12 week scan Gabriel's arms, legs and head can be clearly seen - alongside a heart protruding from his chest. Mrs Kerr, who has two teenage children with a previous partner, now has a string of appointments at her local hospital and with specialists at King's College Hospital in London. Ectopia cordis is a congenital malformation in which the heart is abnormally located either partially or totally outside the chest. The condition can cause the heart to be located anywhere from the neck to the lower abdomen, although in most cases it protrudes outside the chest through a fracture in the breastbone. Incredibly rare, the condition affects only eight in every one million births, with 90 per cent of these babies either stillborn or dying within the first three days - usually through infection, hypoxemia (an abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood), or cardiac failure. Although the exact cause is unknown, ectopia cordis is thought to be related to problems with the development of the baby's 'lateral plate mesoderm', the middle layer of the embryo, in early pregnancy. The development of the muscles that hold the baby's organs in place fails, leading to them bursting through barely developed muscle and bone, and continuing to grow outside the skin. She said: 'He is our little miracle and we are willing him to survive. 'We love him already and we will pray for a miracle. That is all we can do. 'I would give my life for him to be healthy. I think that is what a mother would do for her children.' She added: 'We were told because of our age there was a high chance we could terminate and have a healthy child in the future. 'But we have not just signed up for a healthy child, we have signed up for a baby and this is what we have been given.' Mr and Mrs Kerr are now trying to find other families who have had babies with the condition. Mrs Kerr said: 'We have found a family in Texas online who have had a success story and have contacted them on Facebook but have not heard back from them.' A King's College Hospital NHS Trust spokesman said: 'Ectopia cordis is a rare and extremely serious condition. 'We have discussed the various treatment options with Samantha, and we are providing her with all the information, help and support she needs. 'Whichever choice she makes, we have said we will support her decision, and provide all the appropriate care and treatment.' Dr Gurleen Sharland, a consultant in foetal cardiology at Evelina London hospital, said: 'Ectopia cordis is caused by a defect in the chest wall which can lead to the heart being completely or partially outside the body. 'Sometimes babies suffering from the complication may also be born with other external organs which makes survival more unlikely. 'The condition requires surgery if the baby is to survive but sometimes this is difficult as the heart has developed so long outside the body that the chest is too small to accommodate it.' Mrs Kerr and husband Dennis, 34, married last Saturday and are nervously anticipating the due date of April 17 .","Samantha Kerr, 33, found out her baby has rare condition ectopia cordis .

"When you’re in a rush, it might feel like it takes forever to get a pan of water to boil. But according to an Oxford University engineering professor, the key to speedy cooking is a bit of rocket science. Dr Thomas Povey is an expert on jet and rocket engines, particularly the techniques used to manage and transfer engine heat in the most effective way. Now he has brought the benefits of his knowledge to the nation’s kitchens, dreaming up a new saucepan design which knocks a minute off a boiled egg’s cooking time. From start to finish, it would normally take around six minutes to boil an egg – three minutes for the water to boil plus another three minutes of cooking time. But Dr Povey’s patented new design could reduce this by roughly a minute, which might prove useful for people who need to cook a quick meal in the morning. Called the Flare, the saucepan works best with gas hobs. It has a series of fins which direct flames quickly and evenly up the side of the pan, holding the heat far more effectively than traditional versions. The main body is aluminium but the handles are made of stainless steel, so will not reach the same searing temperatures as the base. Flare pans, which can also be used with electric, ceramic and halogen hobs, reach the right cooking temperature around 34 per cent faster – and use 28 per cent less energy than conventional pans. The Oxford Professor of Engineering has now formed a partnership with Lakeland homewares to turn his prototype into a finished product. The new range will be available in the UK exclusively through the firm’s stores and website. But the cost of joining the kitchen space age comes with some pretty galactic prices – the designs range from £49.99 for a milk pan to £59.99 for a ten-inch frying pan, £64.99 for a saucepan and £84.99 for a top-of-the-range stockpot. Dr Povey said: ‘A lot of tests have been done comparing Flare pans to conventional saucepans and they have proved to be at least 30 per cent faster in coming to the boil.’ The pans go on sale next month starting at £49.99. The finned design channels heat from a gas flame across the bottom and up both sides, to capture energy that would otherwise be wasted. This results in the pan heating up significantly more quickly and cooking food faster. It claims to be 40 per cent more efficient and consequently, faster.","The energy efficient Flare design, which has fins, was dreamed up by a professor of engineering at Oxford University .

"Those feeling a bit woolly as they emerged on Sunday morning in Madrid may have got a shock to see a flock of 2,000 sheep parading through the city's streets. The muster is part of a 700-year-old law that allows farmers to move their livestock through areas that were open pastures and woodland before modern day Madrid became a sprawling city. With the tradition under threat due to modern farming practices, shepherds continue to lead their sheep through the streets to defend their ancient grazing, droving and migration rights. A flock of 2,000 sheep are moved through the streets of Madrid as shepherds preserve ancient tradition . Tourists and local lined the roads, blocked from traffic in the Madrid city centre on Sunday . A shepherd stands in the middle of the flock as the sheep walk where woodland and pastures once were . While a serious statement about their livelihoods, the muster is quite a spectacle for locals and tourists as traffic is blocked to allow the safe passage of the flock. The walk moved through some of the city's most recognisable features, and paused at the old town hall so the chief herdsman could hand authorities their fee for the crossing - they pay 25 maravedies, Iberian copper coins first minted in the 11th century. The shepherds led their sheep by the Puerta del Sol (Madrid's Piccadilly Circus or Times Square equivalent) and past the Bank of Spain's main office as they headed to Retiro Park. A man takes a photo with his smartphone as the sheep move past a host of Madrid's historic landmarks . The chief herdsman paid officials 25 maravedies, a copper currency that first minted in the 11th century . In medieval times, Madrid was a landscape ripe with grazing land and woodland - some of the grazing routes date back to 1372 but have been blocked since King Philip II selected the site to be the capital of his empire in 1561. Musicians and dancers in regional rural costumes accompanied the parade and showed the pride the Spanish take in their native Merino breed of sheep, originally from the historic Castile region of Spain and also Turkey. Now the breed is hugely important to the wool industries of South America and Australia.","Farmers claim ancient rights to move their sheep where fields once were .

"The family of a schizophrenic black man who was gunned down by a white police officer in a park six months ago are still fighting for the cop to be arrested. Officer Christopher Manney, 38, responded to a call for a welfare check for 31-year-old Dontre Hamilton, who was sleeping on a bench in Red Arrow Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on April 30. He gave him a patdown but Hamilton, who had a history of schizophrenia and paranoia, became combative and the pair exchanged punches before Hamilton hit Manney with his baton, and Manney responded with gunfire, killing the man. Earlier this month,  the police department fired Manney, concluding that while he had correctly identified Hamilton as emotionally disturbed, he ignored his training and treated him as a criminal. Scroll down for video . Killed: Dontre Hamilton (left) was shot dead by Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney (right) after Manney was called for a welfare check. A scuffle ensued between the men and Manney shot him 14 times . But the victim's family wants more: criminal charges for the officer, and improvements in the way mentally ill people  are treated by police and social service programs. Hamilton's family participated in a vigil days after his April 30 death but then said little publicly as they waited out an investigation into the shooting. They carried out small, orderly rallies as they waited for details about what happened and for the officer to be disciplined. They were frustrated months later, when protests erupted in Ferguson following the shooting of a black 18-year-old, Michael Brown, by a white officer. Demanding answers: Maria Hamilton holds posters used in rallies calling the release of information and policy changes after her son, Dontre Hamilton, was shot and killed by a police officer . 'We tried to be accepting and respectful of the way the system works,' Hamilton's brother Nate said. 'Until it got to the point where the Mike Brown thing happened. Now, you know who this police officer is, you're seeing them get information, and in Milwaukee, we're not getting no information.' He added: 'They messed with the wrong family... I'm not going to back down.' The family joined a Milwaukee demonstration organized to support those in Ferguson, and attention quickly focused on the similarities between the Brown and Hamilton cases. Nate Hamilton acknowledged some missteps, such as when protesters blocked a freeway exit ramp or became disruptive at a Police and Fire Commission meeting. But overall, the protests have been peaceful, which Nate Hamilton said is crucial to building support for the family's goals. While the protests have highlighted that Manney is white and Hamilton was black, Hamilton's family is focusing on broader issues, including mental health. Police Chief Edward Flynn promised more training for officers dealing with people with mental illness and, on October 15, fired Manney, who has appealed. Calling for justice: Relatives and friends rally for the district attorney to bring charges earlier this month in Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee, where Hamilton was shot after an altercation with the officer . Tragic: Paint left in Red Arrow Park by Dontre Hamilton's family marks the area where he was shot dead . Hamilton's family wants to see Manney charged. The district attorney's office has delayed a decision until it gets a recommendation from a national use-of-force expert. The Hamiltons have been studying the law and police policy to better advocate for changes. They're also finding other ways to channel their grief. Hamilton's mother is organizing a support group for women whose sons died in police shootings or custody and hopes to address shortcomings in mental health and social service programs. Maria Hamilton had struggled to get her son care after insurance problems caused him to miss his medication last winter. Until then, he had been doing well, living in group housing and working. Without the drugs, he became paranoid and began moving from place to place, eventually ending up in the park, where he was sleeping when Manney responded to a call from a nearby business about him. Memorial: Dameion Perkins, left, and his brother, Nate Hamilton, sing a song they wrote about the death of their brother. Proceeds from the song will benefit a foundation established in Hamilton's memory . Never forgotten: Nate Hamilton wears a bracelet honoring his brother Dontre Hamilton as he plays the song . 'Had he had that medication, he might still be sitting here with us,' Maria Hamilton said. Nate Hamilton and another brother, musician Dameion Perkins, wrote a song expressing their grief, anger and frustration. The song describes their 'worst fear' - a brother 'shot 14 times, didn't do no wrong. Laying in the park, really I don't see no harm. The investigation is still going on.' Proceeds from the song sold on iTunes will benefit a foundation established in Hamilton's memory. 'We can't bring Dontre back,' Perkins said, 'but what we can do is help somebody along the way.' Perkins and Nate Hamilton remain bothered by police descriptions of their brother as homeless and violent. They describe Hamilton as fearful, but not dangerous. He checked into a hotel two days before the shooting and had almost $150 in cash on him when he died. Questions: The family said the high-profile rallies held in the aftermath of Michael Brown's death at the hand of white cop Darren Wilson (both pictured), has led to answers in that case that they haven't had in theirs . 'He wasn't dressed bummy, he was still dressed well, he had some Air Jordans on his feet ... so we just felt like that was uncalled for,' said Nate Hamilton, who followed his brother into the roofing business before starting a remodeling company. Maria Hamilton moved her sons from Gary, Indiana, to Milwaukee in 1995 to escape growing gang violence. She raised them to work hard, have faith and look out for one another. But Perkins said the shooting showed them that they had to be leaders. 'It's taught us,' he said, 'to use our minds on a broader scale.'","Dontre Hamilton, 31, was shot by Milwaukee officer Christopher Manney after he found him sleeping on a park bench on April 30 and a scuffle ensued .

"A grieving widow has been arrested after letting her husband's death go unreported for months in the hopes she could fulfill his bizarre last request to be eaten by birds. Ila Solomon, 55, of Lafayette, Ariz., was charged Thursday with welfare fraud, theft, failure to report a dead body, failure to file a death certificate, and unlawful disposition of a dead human body. Authorities claim she was even illegally cashing her dead spouse Gerald Gavan's social security and pension checks. Ila Solomon, 55, of Lafayette, Ariz., was charged Thursday with welfare fraud, theft, failure to report a dead body, failure to file a death certificate, and unlawful disposition of a dead human body . ABC 15 reports that Gavan's body was discovered on the living room floor nine months after his death. Solomon claimed the 88-year-old died on April 28th after suffering a stroke but forensic evidence showed Gavan had been dead since at least July 2013. Solomon previously told reporters that Gavan wanted his body consumed by vultures as part of a ritual in India. 'I just think that somebody who did so much for the United States should have the death he wanted, that's all,' she told ABC 15. 'He just wanted to be eaten by the birds to be part of the cycle of life. 'Plan number two would be for me to take him outside or him to die outside so that the birds could eat him here, but that didn't happen, instead he died right here,' she said. Authorities claim she was even illegally cashing her dead spouse Gerald Gavan's social security and pension checks . Police first went looking for Gavan in May but Solomon told the officers that he'd gone to the Kentucky Derby with her sister and brother-in-law. She also told cops that he'd had a stroke and was being cared for in an assisted living facility. That claim made the officers suspicious and they entered the home only to spot his decomposing body hidden beneath some bed covers an in an advanced state of decay. The union was Solomon's third marriage. Solomon claimed the 88-year-old died on April 28th after suffering a stroke but forensic evidence showed Gavan had been dead since at least July 2013 . Solomon claimed to have returned some of the federal benefit money, but it seemed too little too late. She has declined to comment on the charges.

"When it comes to getting something for nothing, one man from New York thought he was the master. Always on the lookout for a deal, Blake Jareds, 23, from Jericho, Long Island, spotted an offer for the on-demand limo and taxi service, Uber that would see him receive $20 in ride credit for each person that signed up. By referring friends and cleverly forwarding a referral link to various deals and coupon code websites, he was able to rack up $50,000 in credit for future car rides. Creative: Blake Jareds, who works at a New York-based real estate startup signed up so many people to Uber he earned $50,000 in credits . Almost everyone's private driver: Blake Jareds credit was canceled and his account was flagged after he gave one driver a one-star review . All Uber riders know they can get a free $20 credit toward future rides by signing up their friends, but it is safe to say, even someone as popular as Mr Jareds didn't have 2,500 friends. He posted his Uber credit code on a Reddit site for people looking for cut-price deals. His referral link became so popular that if someone searched for 'Uber promotion code' or something similar on Google, his link would be the one that users would sign up. He believes more than 90% of the several thousand people that signed up came from his link. Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Jareds defended his get-free-rides-quick scheme. 'I think my actions were appropriate. Did I violate any of their guidelines out right? No. Did i walk a fine line? Perhaps. I brought them new business that they never had before. I saved them tens of thousands on customer acquisition and generated a huge amount of new revenue.' Although clearly frustrated at the loss of $50,000, Mr Jareds says he doesn't intend to sue. 'Instead of taking it all away, they should have taken back the credit earned from practices they deemed inappropriate and let me keep what was rightfully mine.' Common knowledge: Uber riders know they can get a free $20 credit toward future rides by signing up their friends for the on-demand limo and taxi service . Deceptive? Uber declined to comment on Jareds' claim, but pointed us to the company's credit policy, which requires users to actually know the friends they're signing up for the mobile app . New Uber members were enticed further to use the code as they each received $45 ride credit of their own. Strangers are encouraged to use someone else's referral code to join. Within a matter of weeks, he had racked up enough ride credit to take care of every need.  'Free Uber for life, essentially,' he told MailOnilne. However, Mr Jareds life in the back seat all came to a  grinding halt eight weeks after he began enjoying the hi-life when his account was flagged by the account integrity department at Uber. Mr Jareds, who works at a New York-based real estate startup, believes it occurred after he left a driver a bad review. 'I Rated a driver one star because he . took a terrible route and wasted 30 minutes. That review was probably . flagged in the system, which led to a community manager to review the . ride, and consequently my account. They noticed how high my credits were and froze my account. They informed me that I earned credit inappropriately and my account/credit was suspended.' ' Of course i wished i would have stopped and stayed under the radar with $50k in credits. But at the time, it was too easy and I thought I was doing everything legitimately. I think they would have eventually caught on.' Uber cancelled his credit and wrote him the following curt message: Our system has flagged your account indicating you’ve taken advantage of the Uber referral program to earn Uber credit inappropriately. You will no longer earn credit from invite codes associated with these accounts, and we’ve removed the credit earned previously from the primary account associated with this invite code. Good for business: Mr Jareds believes that more than 2,500 signed up to Uber under his referral code and he should still be earning credits as a result but he has been blocked from doing so . Entrepreneur: Jareds had posted his Uber credit code on a Reddit site for folks looking for cut-price deals, and many of his 2,500 or so referrals came from there . Uber declined to comment on Jareds' claim, but has restated the company's credit policy, which requires . users to actually know the friends they're signing up for the mobile . app. It . prohibits giving away your credit code to strangers: 'public . distribution on sites where you are a contributor but not the primary . content owner (e.g., Wikipedia, coupon websites) is not allowed.'

Only after doing that could he step outside into the corridor and speak to his coach Amelie Mauresmo about how things were going in his fourth-round match against South African giant Kevin Anderson. That, it turned out, was about the only inconvenience of the day as his Wimbledon title defence continues to fall into place.

"Should FIFA ban Luis Suarez after latest bite storm? Luis Suarez's reputation lies in tatters again after the Liverpool striker appeared to bite Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay’s bad-tempered victory in Natal. With just 12 minutes to go and the scores locked at 0-0 here, Suarez and Chiellini fell to the floor in the penalty area. Chiellini seemed absolutely incensed and replays soon showed why as Suarez was shown apparently attempting to dig his teeth in his opponents’ shoulder. Uruguay went on to win the game 1-0 with a goal soon after from captain Diego Godin. They progress to the second phase at Italy’s expense.

Last season’s FWA and PFA Player of the Year will certainly face a FIFA investigation and is likely to be hit with a retrospective ban. He may well claim that his gesture was with his forehead rather than his teeth. Chiellini seemed in no doubt, however, as he appeared to show the Mexican referee marks on his shoulder. Suarez, of course, spent ten games on the side lines in England 14 months after biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic at Anfield. Since then both Suarez and his club manager Brendan Rodgers have claimed that the Uruguayan has changed his ways and this week the South American even claimed the British media were persecuting him. The events present all that as nonsense, however, and Suarez’s future back in England must now be in serious doubt once again. On an afternoon of dire football here on the north-east coast, neither side really deserved to win. The Italians, however, handed their . opponents an advantage they refused to waste when their own midfielder . Claudio Marchisio was sent off midway through the second half for a . stamp at Cristian Rodriguez. Agony: Chiellini lays on the turf clutching his shoulder .

Click here to view our brilliant Match Zone, including Luis Suarez's heat map . Given how much was at stake, it was perhaps not surprising that this game was rather tetchy and stilted in the first half. Nobody could have expected it to be quite as bad as it was, though, with neither team coming remotely close to scoring or even creating a worthwhile chance. Italy . would certainly have been the happier, given that they arrived here . knowing that a draw would take them through. Nevertheless, the half of . football they contributed here was even worse than that which saw them . lost to Costa Rica in Recife last week. Chief . culprit for the Italians was Mario Balotelli who contributed one of . those performances that makes you wonder what anybody ever sees in him. Having scored the winner against England in Manaus, he was less . effective against Costa Rica but at least had a couple of decent efforts . on goal. Heads I win!

Here he did nothing but conduct a running battle with Uruguayan defenders that saw one stand on his ankle early on, prompting Balotelli to gripe and moan all through the first period.

Unhappy: Balotelli contests his booking . Andre Pirlo – as we would expect – did bring a save from Fernando Muslera midway through the half with one of those deceptive, floating free-kicks but that was as close as Italy came before the break. As for Uruguay, they were hardly more progressive. Suarez had admitted on the eve of the game that he still wasn’t fully fit after knee surgery and he wasn’t at his best here. He did work a decent one-two with Nicolas Ledeiro that prompted Gianluigi Buffon to save from both men in succession. They were routine saves, though, and Uruguay’s frustration at being unable to develop any momentum was perhaps personified by defender Martin Ceceres’ attempt to score from 15 yards inside his own half in the 40th minute. Rough and tumble: Andrea Barzagli lets Luis Suarez know he's there . Tough treatment: Giorgio Chiellini challenges Suarez from behind . Perhaps not surprisingly, the ball drifted some distance wide of Buffon’s goal. In to the second half and ultimately it too Marchisio’s red card to bring the game to life at all. Prior to that act of apparent madness, the afternoon had continued to drift. Moments earlier Uruguay had fashioned a genuine chance and Rodriguez certainly should have done better than shoot across goal when played in down the left by Suarez. It was Marchiso who made what threatened to be the defining contribution, though. Quite why he decided to raise his studs in to Rodriguez’s leg when he was in possession of the ball himself is anybody’s guess. What we did know, though, that referee Marco Rodriguez made the correct call and all of a sudden Italy were up against it. Denied: Suarez is thwarted by Gianluigi Buffon . Suarez almost increased Italian worries in the 66th minute as he dashed in to the area after Edinson Cavani’s shot had ricocheted in to his path. Buffon was equal to the low shot, though, extending a strong right arm to divert the ball round the post. Italy – wary that time was beginning to work in their favour – did their best to disrupt an already bitty game further by time wasting and feigning injury. As the game entered its final 15 minutes, it appeared to be working, too, as there was precious little flow or apparent method to Uruguay’s game. Soon enough they did score, the impressive Godin heading in from a corner with nine minutes left. By then, though, all attention had switched to Suarez. Uruguay are through but whether their number nine plays again in this tournament is very doubtful. Blue wonder: Mario Balotelli's girlfriend Fanny Neguesha shows her support .

"A photographer from Victoria, British Columbia, has released a series of images of her friend's C-section in the hopes of demonstrating to the world that the taboo procedure can be a 'peaceful and joyful' experience for both mother and baby. While Jessica Bender, who specializes in maternity photography, had previously documented two natural births, she had never before been given an opportunity to capture a C-Section. So when her friend Carly asked whether she - and her camera - would be present in the delivery room, Jessica leapt at the chance. It was, she says, an unforgettable experience. Bouncing baby boy: Jessica hopes that her photographs will show a different side to C-sections . 'It was very special': While she has previously had the opportunity to document two natural births, this was the first C-section that Jessica had witnessed . Mother and child: Carly couldn't wait to meet her newborn son Elias . 'I could not take my eyes off the surgery site,' she told the Huffington Post. 'There were moments where I almost forgot to take pictures, because I was so caught up in the amazingness of it all. 'I've never witnessed any kind of surgery, and this has got to be the best kind out there, so it was very special.' The photographer captured every aspect of the birth from the procedure itself right up until the moment when Carly and her family were first introduced to the newborn baby boy, named Elias. And while she has had plenty of experience in the delivery room in the past - both during the births of her own two children and while photographing the births of others - the mother-of-two confessed she knew next to nothing about the reality of the C-section procedure before observing Carly's surgery. 'C-sections are beautiful': The photographer was captivated by every aspect of the procedure . Breaking the taboo: Jessica hopes that women everywhere will realize that C-sections are not necessarily something to be feared . Baby Elias: Mother and son are both doing incredibly well following the procedure . Jessica admits that the experience enabled her to see a completely new side to the procedure and she is eager to demonstrate that C-sections are not always the scary and painful nightmares that they are often described as. 'Most women find themselves with a C-section delivery after not being able to progress with a vaginal delivery, and of course that does bring fear,' she said. 'But I would challenge them to leave that, and any feelings of 'failure' at the operating room door. I'd tell them to greet their baby as they would have if the birth plan had gone exactly the way they had envisioned it. 'C-sections are beautiful too. It is still a family, meeting their baby, it’s a miracle.' 'It's a miracle': Jessica was honored to be a part of such a special moment .

"Overdose: David Smith, 67, took his own life with a lethal drug cocktail the day he was due to stand trial for child abuse offences . A former BBC driver and prolific paedophile killed himself on the day he was due to stand trial on new child abuse claims, an inquest heard yesterday. David Smith, chauffeur to celebrities during the 1980s, left a note apologising to his mother and asking to be left to die in 'peace and comfort' after locking himself in his flat and taking an overdose. Police discovered his body after he failed to turn up at Southwark Crown Court last October where he was due to face a jury after being the first person charged under Operation Yewtree - the investigation begun after claims were made against disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile. The 67-year-old convicted child sex abuser was accused of two counts of indecent assault, two of indecency and a fifth charge of rape involving a 12-year-old boy in 1984. On one occasion he was said to have assaulted the boy at the BBC studios at White City in West London. DC Ben Markam, from Operation Yewtree, said when they arrived at his flat in Lewisham, South-East London, a note was on the locked front door with instructions on who to contact to open it. After obtaining a warrant, the detective forced the door open and found the body in his bedroom. It was cold and stiff, as if rigamortis had set in, and there was no pulse, Southwark Coroner's Court heard. Empty packets of pills and a half empty bottle of whisky were also found in the flat, as was a note. It read: 'If still alive allow me to die in peace and comfort, no organs no transplant.' It concluded by saying sorry to his 95-year-old mother and two other people believed to be relatives. Discovery: When Mr Smith didn't attend the first day of his trial, police went to his house with a warrant and found him dead in his bedroom . DC Markham said Smith's flat was dated but neat and tidy with his money and personal possessions carefully arranged on his bedside table. Pathologist Dr Peter Jerreat told the inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court that the cause of death was drug intoxication. 'He had been drinking, but not a significant amount,' he added. 'There were no signs of injury.' Senior Coroner Dr Andrew Harris concluded that the case contained all the 'ingredients' to prove he killed himself by 'deliberately taking a fatal combination' of drugs. Smith had denied abusing the 12-year-old boy, between June 1 and July 21, 1984. He was said to have met his victim at a swimming pool, invited him back to his flat where he abused him. Investigation: Mr Smith was the first to be arrested under Operation Yewtree which was launched in the wake of the allegations against Jimmy Savile, pictured in 2009 . He also took the boy on a visit to the BBC studios at White City. During the journey the boy claimed that he was assaulted. Court documents from the criminal case said there was 'no evidence to suggest any connection' between Smith and Savile, though the former 'was contracted to work as a driver for the BBC in the relevant period', it added. Smith was a prolific sex offender whose first conviction was in 1966. He had 22 convictions for sexual offences against young boys. After his death, another man who had an abuse claim pending against Smith separate from the scheduled trial said his death had cheated him and other alleged victims of seeing justice done. The man said he was 'bitterly disappointed' and 'angry and disappointed' that he would not face trial. A BBC spokesman said: 'We have not found a record of David Smith being employed by or working for the BBC.'","David Smith, 67, worked as a chauffeur to celebrities during the 1980s .

"For all his many talents - raw pace, an explosive strike and a strut of arrogance - Arsenal’s strike-force requires greater replenishing than merely the return of Joel Campbell next season. Campbell appears to be a fine young player, perhaps only usurped by the magnificent Neymar among the younger players at this World Cup so far. He will prove a valuable addition to the Arsenal squad, now that the work permit issues which forced the club to loan him out to Real Betis and Olympiacos in the last two years have been resolved. VIDEO Scroll down for Paulo Wanchope: Joel Campbell wants to impress Wenger . Hard to beat: Campbell holds off future Premier League opponent, England's Phil Jones . Threat: Campbell gets to grip with Luke Shaw as Costa Rica again frustrated a big side in Group D . Campbell offers acceleration that will change the dynamics of Arsenal’s attacking thrust. His rapid flourishes will push the opposition back, force defenders to think differently. No longer should they have to rely solely on Olivier Giroud, as was the case for so much of last season. Campbell, too, seems the kind of hard-working, ball-playing footballer that will respond to the paternal qualities of Arsenal’s manager, Arsene Wenger, and he will be encouraged by the Frenchman’s confirmation that he will be part of the squad for pre-season. Against England, Campbell demonstrated his qualities once more, nipping in before defenders Chris Smalling and Gary Cahill, mithering Luke Shaw with his direct running and providing the locals in Belo Horizonte with an ‘Ole!’ treat after one classy back-flick. In a game that was played out at the tempo of a warm-weather pre-season training camp, there were very few at all out there that flirted, even fleetingly, with inspiration. To his credit, for the sixty-sixty minutes Campbell played, he did as much as any other player to break the stranglehold of tepid mediocrity that enveloped this match, darting in behind at every opportunity, shooting from distance when the opportunity presented itself. High flyer: Campbell controls the ball in the air and looks set to be given a chance by Arsene Wenger . After that, he was rested for the knockout stages, offering a stark reminder of England’s demise as a forward with nine goals in the Greek league last season is conserved for grander occasions. This is not to belittle Campbell, who was irresistible against both Uruguay and Italy. Certainly, he can make an impact for Arsenal next season. But can he transform Wenger’s side from also-rans to title winners? That much would seem to be the stuff of fantasy and Arsenal fans must dearly hope that Arsene Wenger has greater ambitions in this transfer window. Arsenal must buy a forward of elite-standing, a game-changer, somebody that will strike fear, rather than comfort, into the defences of the continent’s finest outfits. Campbell, who has scored just eleven club goals in the last two seasons, is evidently not that man. Arsenal fans need a Mario Balotelli, not a chap they’ve only seen on the telly. In this Costa-Rica team, Campbell is the go-to player, the one that is worshipped.  In this perfectly-oiled, intensely drilled side, Campbell’s ability is blended with adrenalin and a fervent national pride. When he returns to Arsenal, he will be an understudy with a point to prove. Time will tell whether he can elevate his performances on a consistent basis, but Wenger must know better than to demand too much, too soon.

'There's no point in hiding,' she said . in the interview. 'Everybody has already seen my face and my body, but . that's not what I am and who I am.' Jada told the station that she had attended a party with a friend, and thought it was just going to be kids hanging out. But when she showed up, the teen boy hosting the party gave her a drink of punch she believes was spiked with some sort of drug.

They aspire to be neutral conduits of data and to sit outside or above politics. ‘But increasingly their services not only host the material of violent extremism or child exploitation, but are the routes for the facilitation of crime and terrorism. ‘However much they may dislike it, they have become the command and control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals, who find their services as transformational as the rest of us.’ An aerial view of Government Communications Headquarters in Benhall, in the suburbs of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire: The agency's new chief says internet firms need to open up even more to state spies .

"An Eton-educated Tory has become the first minister to visit Communist Cuba in 10 years, the Foreign Office said today. Hugo Swire is holding meetings with the country’s revolutionary government to secure more support to tackle the Ebola crisis in West Africa. Cuba is sending hundreds of doctors to work in British aid centres in Sierra Leone. Hugo Swire (left), the Conservative Foreign Office minister, is in Cuba to hold talks with the Government of Raul Castro (right) Mr Hugo Swire (right) spoke to Cuban boxer Felix Savon (left) after signing an agreement of cooperation with Cuban first vice president of National Institute of Sports, Education and Recreation Roberto Leon Richards . Mr Swire, a former director of Sotheby's auction house and army officer, said it had been ‘too long’ since a British minister had visited Cuba. The Foreign Office said Mr Swire arrived in Cuba on Wednesday and is set to leave the Caribbean island tomorrow. He is due to meet Mariela Castro, the daughter of Cuban president Raúl Castro and the niece of former president Fidel Castro. Mr Swire said: ‘It has been too long since a UK Minister was in Cuba, but I’m very happy to rectify that. Although we naturally have our differences, we work together where we can, including on the response to the Ebola epidemic, where Cuba is playing a vital international role. ‘Cuba is sending hundreds of medical professionals to UK-run facilities in Sierra Leone on top of staff already in that country and in Guinea. ‘I am proud that we can work together on such an important cause, and one which the UK has committed £205m to tackling. It has the potential to become a global problem and as such needs a global solution.’ Former Cuban President Fidel Castro handed over power to his brother Raul in 2008 . Mr Swire’s politics and background could not be further removed from the Communist regime ruling Cuba since the 1960s. Before going into politics, the foreign office minister served in the Grenadier Guards and as a financial consultant. He is the third Great Grandson of John Swire – the founder of the giant Liverpool textile trading business. Mr Swire married Alexandra Nott, the daughter of John Nott – the former Conservative Secretary of State for Defence during the Falklands War.

'However, we also recognise that Cuba is changing and welcome advances of the past two years, including new economic freedoms, the release of political prisoners, and the easing of travel restrictions. 'We believe that the time is right to engage with Cuba across a broad spectrum of issues, including prosperity interests. Cuba is in the process of gradual reform and the EU is also seeking to upgrade its relations via negotiation of a new PDCA.'","Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire in four-day visit to Communist state .

"Chinese security officials carried out anal probes on more than 10,000 pigeons released during National Day celebrations, amid fears they may have been carrying bombs. The birds were released during this morning's dawn ceremony in Beijing's symbolic heart, Tiananmen Square - but only after each bird passed a rigorous and highly unusual examination for explosives. Beijing police were concerned that would-be terrorists targetting one of China's biggest public events this year may have  used the birds as mobile bombs - rigging them with incendiary devices that could be detonated either at close proximity to a government official, or as the birds flew over the crowd. Suspicious items: Reports of the examinations - which did not say exactly what investigators were looking for - drew amused and derisive responses from some Chinese readers on many news websites . Threatened: Beijing police were concerned that would-be terrorists targetting one of China's biggest public events this year (pictured) may have used the birds as mobile bombs . The symbols of peace were released at sunrise in  Tiananmen Square in a ceremony for the October 1 holiday to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Beijing domestic security police officer Guo Chunwei was quoted in the Jinghua Times as saying workers checked the wings, legs and anus of each pigeon ahead of time to ensure they were ""not carrying suspicious material."" The entire process was videotaped, and the birds were then loaded into sealed vehicles for the trip to Tiananmen Square, the newspaper said. A similar report appeared in the Beijing News, and the People's Daily tweeted about it in English: '10,000 pigeons go through anal security check for suspicious objects Tue, ready to be released on National Day on Wed.' The reports — which did not say what the suspicious materials might be — drew amused and derisive responses from some Chinese readers, and many news sites - including the Beijing News website - later deleted the reports.

Security: The entire examination process was videotaped before the birds were loaded into sealed vehicles to join the jubilant celebrations taking place Tiananmen Square (pictured) Tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters have taken to the streets of Hong Kong this morning as demonstrations spread to new areas of the territory on Chinese National Day. There was little sign of momentum flagging on the fifth day of the mass campaign, whose aim has been to occupy sections of the city in order to express fury at a Chinese decision to limit voters' choices in Hong Kong's 2017 leadership election. Some protesters  could this morning be heard jeering Chinese National Day celebrations despite earlier fears that police would use force to move the massive crowds on before events marking the 65th anniversary of the Communist Party's foundation of the People's Republic of China began. The crowds have brought large sections of the Asian . financial hub to a standstill over the past five days, disrupting businesses from banks . to jewellers. Overnight thunderstorms failed to dampen spirits . and the protesters woke to blue skies on Wednesday. Riot police had used tear gas, pepper spray and baton . charges at the weekend to try to quell the unrest but tensions . have eased since then with both sides prepared to wait it . out - at least for now. Members of the Chinese public responded with sarcasm because they see in the pigeon body searches their own plight in what they consider an oppressive society with tight surveillance, censorship and judicial injustice, according to independent commentator Zhang Ping. 'The liberty and dignity of citizens are increasingly vulnerable, and can be expropriated at any time, like with the pigeons,' Zhang wrote in an editorial that was circulated on social media under his pen name, Changping. 'They have to go through the pains and insults of the rude anal check and yet they must appear peaceful and happy on the screen of the state broadcaster.' The security measures reflect heightened concern about violence following a string of attacks blamed on separatist militants from the country's ethnic Uighur Muslim minority, as well as bus explosions and random slashing attacks attributed to disgruntled individuals. Last October, three Uighurs in a vehicle rammed through crowds in front of Tiananmen Gate in central Beijing and set off explosives in an attack that killed themselves and three bystanders. Beijing authorities also are sending police helicopters to monitor highway checkpoints, ring roads within the city, major intersections and areas with heavy traffic, including popular tourist spots such as the Great Wall and the Summer Palace, the Beijing News said. Additionally, the capital has mobilized 850,000 citizen volunteers to help keep a lookout in the city of about 20 million people, the newspaper said.","Birds released at ceremony in Beijing - but only after rigorous examination .

"Was it at 2.01pm on Saturday that Lewis Hamilton’s extraordinary miscalculation brought an end to his dreams of a second world title and his wider hopes of becoming an all-time great of his sport? It may yet unfold that this conjurer of the track, the phenomenal Lewis, will drive as brilliantly in the British Grand Prix on Sunday as he acted foolishly in qualifying here and restore himself in his title fight with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Nothing can ever be ruled out with Hamilton, this see-sawing driver, but on Saturday night the feeling was that a dramatic, defining, damning moment had left its imprint on the 2014 season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch on-board lap with Lewis Hamilton round the Silverstone circuit . Rattled: Lewis Hamilton (left) has allowed Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to get under his skin at times . The incident came in the final lap of qualifying, when Hamilton decided to abort his final flying lap for no compelling reason. Rosberg passed him, set the fastest lap and will start the race from pole. Hamilton, who trails Rosberg by 29 points, will start from sixth. Why? ‘I don’t know,’ said Hamilton, at his surly worst when asked for an explanation in front of the BBC cameras. ‘I don’t have much of an answer. I just decided not to do the lap.’ With that he walked off almost as ill-advisedly as he had turned off the track a few minutes earlier.Where was his respect for ‘the greatest fans in the world’, the British public he had buttered up a few days earlier with what now sounded like empty platitudes? Too slow: Rosberg passed Hamilton to set the fastest lap and will start Sunday's race from pole . But back to qualifying, which was beset by changing conditions: drizzle, rain, cloudy but dry, sunny. Hamilton had set the fastest time in his first lap of the final session before rain fell harder and all the cars came in. Niki Would the rain relent, allowing them to go out again? Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, said: ‘The team wanted them to stay in, but the drivers said they wanted to get in another lap, so it was decided they would.’ In that final, supposed shootout, Hamilton made a small mistake, locking up, at the Arena - Turn Four - and, believing it to be too wet to beat his previous time, pulled out of the lap and let Rosberg through to capitalise on the markedly drier conditions at the end of track. Mercedes put out a statement a few minutes later to explain Hamilton’s side of the story. ‘I made a mistake today and pulled out of the lap when I should have kept going,’ he said. Mistake: Hamilton's miscalculation could end his dreams of a second world title . ‘It was a tough qualifying with the changing conditions and we got through most of it really well, until the most important part. ‘It was my decision, a bad call, and that decided my qualifying. ‘I’m so sorry to have disappointed the fans here today as their support has been fantastic and I’ll do what I can to have a great race for them on Sunday. I need to have a start like I had in Austria two weeks ago and then do my best to get back to the front. You never know what might happen. ‘It’s difficult when you're just out of the car to express your emotions and see the positive, but I’ll go back to the team and my family now and we'll build up for tomorrow from there.’ Pole: Rosberg (centre) Sebastian Vettel, and Jenson Button (left) will start from the front at Silverstone . Well, that was like the Gettysburg address compared to the muddle of excuses – amid some perfectly reasonable excuses – put forward by Hamilton when he came to his press conference later. His funniest claim was that, ‘I never give up’. So, what were you doing abandoning the lap, Lewis? He again accepted that it was his fault, yet, contradicting that, cited the failure of the team to tell him it was faster in the final part of the lap as some sort of mitigation for his decision. What makes Saturday’s antics most bizarre is that Hamilton, for all his ups and downs, has always been a racer, a fight-to-the-end warrior. But here at Silverstone, of all places, where conditions are famously different from one end of the track to another, did he decide to stop. Lead: Hamilton (right) rounds a corner ahead Rosberg during qualification on Saturday . He could have qualified second or third or fourth or fifth. In fact, he could have beaten Rosberg. There is a pattern emerging: he has made mistakes in the past most recent qualifying sessions, a part of his performance that is traditionally extremely strong. Rosberg, it seems, has rattled him. Sir Jackie Stewart, watching from the paddock, said: ‘His head certainly seems to have gone a bit.’ Finish: Button celebrates after taking third position in the qualifying session of the British Formula One Grand Prix . One question is whether Hamilton has the intellectual gifts to find the answers against the calculating, clever Rosberg. Another is whether he will resist thinking the team are against him. Ostensibly declining to wade into psychological warfare, the German did so stealthily, saying: ‘With regards to the championship, it’s good for me that Lewis is down in sixth.’ Hamilton finished the afternoon by, again, promising the fans more today. It all sounded a little hollow in the circumstances.","Lewis Hamilton's British Grand Prix qualifying miscalculation allowed Nico Rosberg to grab pole position .

"Former IRA commander Martin McGuinness has said he likes the Queen, adding that the British monarch showed courage in agreeing to meet with him and rising above his terrorist past. Sinn Fein's deputy first minister first met the Queen when they shook hands at a charity event in Belfast in 2012 in a highly symbolic gesture of reconciliation. Last June, the veteran republican guided her around Belfast's former Crumlin Road prison, where he and his power-sharing partner at the devolved administration at Stormont, first minister Peter Robinson, were incarcerated during the conflict. Meeting: Former IRA commander Martin McGuinness, who met the Queen for the first time at a Belfast charity event in 2012, said he likes the monarch, who he added showed 'courage' in agreeing to meet him . 'I liked her courage in agreeing to meet with me; I liked the engagements that I've had with her,' said Mr McGuinness. 'There's nothing I have seen in my engagements with her that this is someone I should dislike, I like her.' He said the Queen understood the significance of the peace process. The Sinn Fein leader told the BBC: 'I know who Queen Elizabeth represents. I know she's the head of the British state. I know she has all sorts of titles in relation to different regiments in the British army. 'She knows my history. She knows I was a member of the IRA. She knows I was in conflict with her soldiers, yet both of us were prepared to rise above all of that.' Guest: Earlier this year Mr McGuinness attended a Windsor Castle banquet given by the Queen in honour of the state visit to Britain by Irish president Michael D Higgins, pictured with the Queen, Prince Philip and Mr Higgins's wife Sabina Coyne . Joining in: Mr McGuinness, pictured at the banquet, joined in a toast to the monarch as an orchestra played God Save The Queen . Earlier this year Mr McGuinness attended a Windsor Castle banquet given by the Queen in honour of the state visit to Britain by Irish president Michael D Higgins. He joined in a toast to the monarch as an orchestra played God Save The Queen. The politician last met the Queen in June at Crumlin Road Gaol. Once a forbidding institution synonymous with the grim years of the conflict, the transformation of the notorious prison into a popular visitor attraction is symbolic of Northern Ireland's journey toward peace. Mr McGuinness was held in the prison for over a month in 1976 on a charge of IRA membership - a count that was later dropped in court. Democratic Unionist leader Mr Robinson was detained there during the 1980s for his involvement in protests against the controversial Anglo Irish Agreement. When he was a Sinn Fein MP Mr McGuinness refused to sit in the House of Commons because he would have had to swear an oath of allegiance to the monarch. The republican party still does not take up its seats at Westminster but is the largest in nationalism and forms a decisive part of the mandatory coalition at Stormont with the Democratic Unionists and smaller parties. The administration is fragile following disagreements between unionists and nationalists over parades, flags and dealing with the legacy of a 30-year conflict which left thousands dead or injured. Mr McGuinness made his latest comments in a BBC documentary, History in their Hands, broadcast on Radio Ulster.","Sinn Fein politician first met the Queen in 2012 at a charity event in Belfast .

"The Duke University freshman who turned to a career in porn to fund her education identified herself Tuesday in an online column in which she revealed a photo of herself under her stage name, Belle Knox. Knox - previously identified by her college newspaper as 'Lauren' - was the subject of an article that appeared in the Duke Chronicle last month about the male classmate who outed her as a porn star to fraternities and sororities at the university. In her column, Knox describes the bullying she's received since word of her porn career spread across her college campus - and the Internet. Scroll down for video . Revealed: The Duke University freshman revealed this photo of herself in a column for XOJane.com as well as her stage name, Belle Knox . Bullied: Knox says people have set up fake Twitter accounts and used them to harass her . Threats: Knox says both she and her family have received threats since her identity was revealed . 'My decision to do porn to pay for college was a private one I made, and then I was outed to my university classmates by another Duke student who had seen me on the Internet a few months ago,' Knox wrote in the column, which appeared on the website XOJane.com. 'He proceeded to reveal who I was to the entire Greek system . . . I started to be harassed. He started to be applauded.' Some of the harassment Knox describes include calls for her to leave Duke because of the humiliation she has caused the university, and some even saying that she killer herself. 'Most recently, I have been told that I am “an embarrassment to Duke,” I bring nothing but bad publicity to my school, and I need to be silent,' she writes. 'Do I want to behave and be a good girl? Then ""no more media,"" I am told. The message repeated to me seems clear: ""You are not a human being. You have no rights or feelings. You are simply a nuisance. You have to stay silent. No matter what, just stay silent.""' Knox ends her column with 'today, I am choosing to reveal my porn identity to the world. My name is Belle Knox, and I wear my Scarlet Letter with pride.' Knox's story came to light last month after the Duke Chronicle ran an article about how the trouble started for 'Lauren' when fellow college freshman Thomas Bagley came up to her and asked her if she was the same girl as the adult film star he'd been watching. Knox admitted that she acted in pornographic films under a stage name, but swore him to secrecy. Joy: Knox previously said that her experience in porn has brought her 'unimaginable joy' For his part, Bagley denies having recognized her in porn, telling the Daily Caller that she actually confessed her secret to him. Both agree that despite his promise, Bagley blabbed at his next fraternity rush event. Once he leaked the secret, people across campus were texting and tweeting about the Duke freshman porn star within a matter of days. The aspiring lawyer was crudely mocked and attacked online. 'If you b***ed her, report in,' wrote one anonymous poster on the CollegiateACB message board. 'We going to pretend like she . was unaware of the social consequences of going into that business? she . made a decision, now she needs to live with the consequences,' wrote another. She soon found herself talking to the campus newspaper about her life in porn, which Lauren would later call an attempt to control the conversation. In that interview, Knox said she started in adult films as a way to offset her massive tuition bills, and called the Duke campus a place where women had to hide their sexuality, and were held to a 'virgin-wh*** dichotomy.' In that story, the author took note of Knox's 'designer bag' and new iPad as proof of her porn-riches. Higher learning: Duke students took to the internet to criticize Lauren's career choices and speculate who might have had sex with her . However, Knox wasn't entirely pleased with the Chronicle's representation. While she thanked them for giving her a forum she also accused them of skewing her words and betraying her trust in a response on the blog Develle Dish, adding that they had 'portrayed me as a naïve, attention seeking little girl who flaunts her wealth.' She went even further detailing her life in pornography and the lack of impact she expects it to have on her future in a first-hand account published on xoJane later that week. 'I couldn't afford $60,000 in tuition, my family has undergone . significant financial burden, and I saw a way to graduate from my dream . school free of debt, doing something I absolutely love,' Knox - as 'Lauren' - wrote. 'Because to be . clear: My experience in porn has been nothing but supportive, exciting, . thrilling and empowering.' She further elaborated that the site she performed for was a 'rough sex website' but that she had never been 'coerced or harmed' while filming. 'Everyone has their kinks and we should not shame anyone for enjoying something that is perfectly legal and consensual for all parties involved,' she wrote. First-hand: In an article on xoJane, Lauren said she had no fear of porn impacting her future career as she wouldn't want to work for anyone who held it against her . 'For me, shooting pornography brings me unimaginable joy. When I finish a scene, I know that I have done so and completed an honest day's work. It is my artistic outlet, my love, my happiness, my home.' Finally, she shot back at critics who claimed she was being degraded: 'I can honestly say that I have never felt more empowered or happy doing anything else.' Knox also called for people to examine why they treated female sexuality 'with such disdain,' and dismissed online comments that said her history would prevent her from finding work after graduation. 'I wouldn’t want to work for someone who discriminates against sex workers,' she wrote.","The Duke freshman identified herself by her stage name, 'Belle Knox'

"These are the pictures posted on a social networking website which raised the suspicions of Queensland Police and led to bomb squads being sent to a home just kilometres from where the G20 will be held. They were posted on Facebook by a 32-year-old Rochedale South man whose home was searched by police and a series of controlled explosions were carried out on Saturday afternoon. The man has been charged with a number of offences including manufacturing explosives, following the discovery of explosive chemicals, drugs, bullet shells and a training grenade, reports ABC. A 32-year-old Rochedale man posted pictures of home-made explosives on Facebook . The photos were seen by police and bomb squads were sent to his home to investigate . Photos of home-made explosives were found on the man's Facebook page which grabbed the attention of the police . Superintendent Noel Powers told media at a press conference on Sunday the man, from Logan City in Brisbane's south, was not an avid maker but that the man had been 'fully compliant' with police inquiries. '[He's] someone with an unhealthy curiosity towards explosives, combined with a limited knowledge of chemistry - perhaps a more than average level of knowledge in chemistry - it's a lethal combination. 'He's been posting certain images and comments on Facebook that has come to our attention and thank God we've been able to action it from there,' Superintendent Powers told the press conference, reports ABC. Queensland Police have warned 'even small amounts' of chemicals found at the home could be dangerous. A police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that several streets have been blocked off since Saturday afternoon and will remain in lock-down for the next couple of days. Commissioner Ian Stewart said all motorcades will be watched over the next 10 days to ensure leaders are taken from the airport to accommodation, as well as their meetings with full security. The man's Facebook page is littered with pictures of him holding guns and knives . Roads near the property will remain closed for the next few days . Queensland Police say there's no suggestion they are linked to terrorism . Explosives specialists are currently performing a series of controlled denotations at the home . 'Until this event is safely delivered, we will continue to operate and conduct bomb searches outside the centre,' he said in a conference on Sunday. 'It is concerning as to why someone would do this in a suburban area and it's a situation where people are dealing with dangerous chemicals but our job now is to render the scene safe. 'We can ensure the community that there has been no threats to the G20 or anything related to the summit meeting.' Treasurer Tim Nicholls said the police operation has been running exceptionally smooth to ensure everyone has a safe and secure environment ahead of next week's leaders summit. 'We encourage people to come to the city and do so with high certainty of being safe and enjoy life as normal', he said. 'In a major event like this, we are conducting a peaceful and secure summit here in Brisbane, not just for our guests and visitors but for the entire community. 'And this is a real opportunity for Queensland to show the rest of the world what we do.' Queensland police were called to Rochedale South in Logan City of Brisbane's southside at 4.15pm on Saturday after discovering explosive devices in a home . Officers from the Explosive Ordnance Response Team are dealing with numerous explosive devices and will continue to render the scene safe with controlled detonations continuing throughout the day. Police are advising nearby residents to stay indoors and warn they're likely to hear explosions.

"A powerful Pacific storm predicted to grow to hurricane force churned toward Hawaii this morning, bringing with it heavy rains and potentially devastating winds that could wreak havoc upon the island state today. Forecasters said that the storm likely will bring 40 to 50 mph winds to the Big Island's Kau, Puna and South Kona districts. 'Right now, we expect the main impacts to be on the Big Island,' National Weather Service meteorologist Ray Tanabe said on Thursday. The weather service has issued a tropical storm watch for the island. Fears: Tropical Storm Ana likely will become a hurricane by Friday evening but return to tropical storm strength Saturday morning . Tropical Storm Ana likely will become a hurricane by Friday evening but return to tropical storm strength Saturday morning, Tanabe said. That's also when the storm is forecast to be closest to the island — about 85 to 90 miles offshore to the southwest. The storm will be farther from the coast than predicted earlier, and will be a hurricane for a shorter period than previously thought, they said. The soil in the Kau district already is heavily saturated from recent thunderstorms, raising the risk of flooding there. The weather service issued a flash flood watch for the entire state from Friday through Sunday, indicating flooding is possible anywhere in the archipelago, said Chris Brenchley, a weather service meteorologist. Between 5 to 10 inches of rain may fall, though locally some areas could get 20 inches or more, he said. Flooding: The soil in the Kau district already is heavily saturated from recent thunderstorms, raising the risk of flooding there . Ana (AH - nah) is expected to lose some power as it moves northwest along the island chain. It could bring 40 mph to 50 mph winds to Oahu — which is home to Honolulu, the state's biggest city — and Kauai. Gusts could reach up to 75 mph near the storm's center. 'It will weaken, but it still will be packing some pretty strong winds,' Tanabe said. The current forecast calls for Ana to approach Oahu and Kauai more closely than the Big Island, but it will likely be a tropical storm and not a hurricane then. Kauai Mayor Bernard Carvalho, Jr. on Thursday proclaimed an emergency to help his county respond to storm damage on Kauai and Niihau islands. State officials and Civil Air Patrol personnel have hiked and flown to Kalalau Valley, Polihale and other remote parts of Kauai to tell campers about the approaching storm, the county said.","Tropical Storm Ana likely to become a hurricane on Friday night .

"Bookies reckon Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert should be looking over his shoulder after his new No 2, Roy Keane, was installed as favourite to be the club's next permanent boss. Keane will join forces with Lambert while continuing to work as assistant to Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill. Former Sunderland and Ipswich manager Keane linked up with O'Neill in November and is now returning to club football at Villa Park.

Lambert, who had his coaching staff significantly depleted last season when assistant Ian Culverhouse and football operations manager Gary Karsa were suspended and then sacked for unspecified disciplinary reasons, has welcomed Keane to the Midlands. He said: ''Roy has a great knowledge of football, on the coaching side as well, and he'll be a great asset and a big help to everybody here at Aston Villa Football Club.

The players will love working with him. 'Although we never played together, we competed against one another and he's someone for whom I have a lot of time and respect. He has worked under some great managers, some of the most successful in the game, and he'll be a great help to myself as well. 'Roy brought Sunderland up out of the Championship and into the Premier League, he gained further experience at Ipswich - where we were close rivals while I was manager at Norwich - and he's now working at international level as assistant manager with the Republic of Ireland. 'All of that experience and knowledge along with the qualities he has as a longstanding, leading professional in the game means he will bring a lot to the table. We're delighted to have him here.'

"Mary Brown, of New Mexico, says her special-needs daughter has been trying to wipe out her family with poison, but when she sought treatment for the disturbed teen, the mother was charged with child abuse. Brown, a mother of two from Hobbs, says her 15-year-old daughter, Katie, laced food and drinks with toxic cleaning products on three separate occasions this year, causing severe damage to her sister's vocal chords. When Katie Brown was born, she suffered a brain hemorrhage that resulted in cerebral palsy - a condition that causes movement problems and a host of disabilities. Dangerous mind: Katie Brown, 15, who suffers from cerebral palsy, has allegedly poisoned her family three times . Victim: Katie's mother, Mary Brown, said her special-needs daughter got mad at her in March for making her do chores and laced her iced tea with Lysol . Weapons of choice: In June, Katie poured bleach in her mother's Coke, and in August she sprayed a carpet cleaner on a tray of cornbread . 'She just has outbursts, and we never know when they're coming,' Mary Brown told the station KOB4. For Brown and her family, things took a dangerous turn in March when Katie poured Lysol cleaning liquid in her mother's iced tea as payback for making her do house chores. Brown drove her daughter to a hospital for psychiatric treatment, but the 15-year-old was released. Three months later, the mentally unstable girl spiked her mother's Coca Cola with bleach, but once again the hospital let her return home after a brief stay. Then in August Katie sprayed toxic carpet cleaner on cornbread. 'She started laughing and said I put rat poison on it,' Brown recalled. In harm's way: Katie's sister, Kaylee, pictured left and right, and Mary Brown's boyfriend, Eugene Fraust (right), ate the tainted cornbread and suffered damage to their vocal chords . Kaylee Brown was forced to leave her high school choir after the August poisoning . Brown's other daughter, Kaylee, and her boyfriend who ate some of the tainted food suffered damage to their vocal chords. Katie's sister was even forced to leave her high school choir because she lost her ability to sing. Brown's boyfriend, Eugene Fraust, said he was told by his doctor that another such poisoning could prove fatal for him. Fearing for the lives of her loved ones, Brown once again took Katie to a hospital, but this time she would not let her come home until she received help. Desperate measure: Brown was charged with child abuse after taking Katie to the hospital for treatment and not allowing her to return home . As a result of her actions, the mother of two has been charged with child abuse and the 15-year-old has been taken into state custody. But Mary Brown says her daughter belongs in a mental hospital, where she could receive the care and treatment she needs. ‘I love my daughter, and all I want for her is to get the help she needs,’ said Brown.","Mary Brown, from New Mexico, says her daughter Katie spiked food and drinks three times this year .

"It says a lot about how miserable a World Cup semi-final was contested in Sao Paulo that even the penalty shootout was somehow dull. The one moment of sparkling genius in an otherwise turgid match featuring Argentina and Holland was a tackle by Javier Mascherano. What a tackle it was. With the game seemingly destined for extra-time, Holland’s star of this World Cup, Arjen Robben, made a last-gasp bid to snatch a spot in Sunday’s final with just seconds left on the clock. Robben burst on to a cute flick from Wesley Sneijder, took two touches at full pace to bear down on Sergio Romero’s goal and unleashed the shot that would break Argentine hearts. But somehow there was Mascherano. His diving boot was dangled in hope and despair but arrived with timing so perfect it could make a Swiss watchmaker blush. Danger averted, match saved. Thirty minutes of stupefying extra-time and that anti-climax of a penalty shootout later, and Argentina were heading for their date with destiny. Moment of truth: Javier Mascherano tackles Arjen Robben in the World Cup semi-final on Wednesday . They think it's all over: Robben had looked certain to score as he closed in on goal in the dying seconds . Lunge: Robben got his shot away but Mascherano dived in to block the effort with an outstretched boot . None shall pass: The defensive midfielder thwarted the Dutch winger with a perfectly-timed tackle . VIDEO Argentina scrape into fifth final . Holland and Argentina are famed for producing players of rarefied skill and exquisite technique, but this was a match for demolition experts rather than architects of footballing beauty. Mascherano was the man swinging the wrecking ball into Holland’s midfield throughout. And he did all of this after an early clash of heads left him briefly unconscious. In a team featuring Lionel Messi, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Gonzalo Higuain, plus Sergio Aguero and Angel di Maria when fit (and Carlos Tevez when selected), it is easy to forget about Mascherano. He breaks up play, passes the ball simply and goes about his business with the minimum of fuss, apart from the odd scything tackle here or there. You might say he rarely catches the eye, but he often catches the shin. Mascherano doesn’t even play in his favoured midfield position for his club. Barcelona have instead squeezed him into the side as an auxiliary centre-back since his move to the Nou Camp in 2010, although that may change next season under new boss Luis Enrique. Maracana, here we come! Argentina celebrate their penalty shootout victory over Holland . Star man: Lionel Messi will carry the hopes of his nation in the final against Germany . Wrecking ball: But it is Mascherano's grit and graft that could prove decisive, as it did against Holland . Javier Mascherano (Argentina) 478 . Philipp Lahm (Germany) 458 . Toni Kroos (Germany) 443 . Daley Blind (Holland) 323 . Stefan de Vrij (Holland) 323 . Oscar (Brazil) 30 . Mehrdad Pooladi (Iran) 19 . Javier Mascherano (Argentina) 18 . Kyle Beckerman (USA) 18 . Luiz Gustavo (Brazil) 17 . Liverpool fans will recognise the wisdom in that decision. After his bizarre arrival in English football alongside Tevez at West Ham in 2006, Mascherano moved to Anfield a year later and made his name as one of European football’s toughest-tackling midfield spoilers. Liverpool were powerless to stop him joining Barca, where he has faded from view somewhat, stuck behind Sergio Busquets and Alex Song in the defensive midfield pecking order. But this World Cup has provided a timely reminder of just how effective a midfielder Mascherano is. At 30 years-of-age and with 104 caps to his name, the former Corinthians and River Plate star was able to call on a vast wealth of experience to rescue his county when they needed him most. The statistics also show that Mascherano has had a highly effective World Cup overall, having made more tackles than any other players apart from Brazil’s Oscar and Mehrdad Pooladi of Iran (google him). But the more eyecatching number posted by Mascherano is the amount of successful passes he has completed in Brazil – 478 and counting, the highest of any player at the World Cup so far - at a rate of 86.6 per cent. Argentina owe their passage to the World Cup final as much to that tackle on Robben as to any of Messi’s four goals in Brazil. And if they are to claim the game’s ultimate prize in the Maracana on Sunday, it will depend on Mascherano's ability to roll up his sleeves and dismantle the German passing machine.

"An owl in Minnesota is lucky not to have become a permanent hood ornament when it got lodged in the grille of a passing car. Around 3:30am last Thursday, an owl was hunting along Highway 169 in Plymouth when it swooped down to catch its prey. Stuck: Kenneth Love was surprised when a swooping owl struck his car in the early morning and became lodged in the grille . At that exact moment, Kenneth Love was passing through the area and their fates collided, as the bird was struck at the perfect angle and became lodged in the grille of Love's car. After seeing the bird crash into the front of his car, he drove to a friend's house to try and pull the owl free with the help of some thick gloves. Watching: Love said the bird watched 'every move' he made as he and a friend tried unsuccessfully to pull the bird free . He records video of the rescue attempt, but in spite of all their efforts, the owl still can't get break free. Love tweeted that the owl 'kept looking at me every move I made while stuck' and told ABC the bird bit at him. Finally, Love calls police, who covered the bird's head with a towel before finally pulling it free. Love's own feathers were ruffled by the incident. He tweeted later: 'I don't care if I am a man. I'm just a city boy. Don't see this everyday.' The bird was then taken to the Minnesota Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota in St Paul, where it's currently recovering. According to the center's weekly patient census, the owl joined seven other great horned owls, one screech owl and one long-eared owl. This owl was lucky to be freed as quickly as it was. Last year, the Huffington Post reported a woman in south Florida struck an owl while driving along the turnpike late at night. She assumed she had killed the bird, saying that she didn't stop to check at the time because it was dark. When she went out to run errands the next day, a family flagged her down, telling her something was caught behind her grille. As it turns out, the owl had simply fallen through the slats and become stuck, though it emerged from the incident unscathed.","Kenneth Love was driving along Highway 169 in Plymouth when he struck an owl, which became stuck in the grill .

"BIG BOOTS TO FILL . Brazil will never be able to replace Neymar, but Oscar and Willian can give it a good go. Jose Mourinho has championed Oscar in that role behind the striker, so much so that he sold Juan Mata to play him there. Neymar has thrived in that position but Oscar can, too. He is a complete footballer and is tenacious with and without the ball. If he plays through the middle expect him to be buzzing all over Bastian Schweinsteiger. His Chelsea team-mate Willian could also be involved and whether he plays out wide or through the middle, he will add some serious mileage to this team because he is a real worker. VIDEO Scroll down for Neymar's likely replacements Willian and Bernard in Brazil training . Filling in:  Chelsea's Oscar (left) and Willian (right) will have to fill the void left by Neymar . Loss: Neymar's tournament is over after he sustained a back injury against Colombia . HEARTS v HEADS . I've been in the stadium for Brazil’s last two games and the atmosphere is unbelievable. It just does not stop. As a player it is difficult to raise your head up and out of that and to stay calm, but that is what Brazil must do. Whenever the hosts score the overwhelming sensation is relief, but then they can go into panic mode and lose their heads. That’s why they’ve been scraping through games. They could have done with somebody like Kaka, who has won the World Cup, in the squad to help settle them. The Germans have not been brilliant, but they are an excellent tournament team and are well organised. If Brazil play with too much emotion, Germany could calmly exploit it. VIDEO Willian ready to fill Neymar's boots . Passion: Brazil celebrate David Luiz's goal against Colombia in Fortaleza . Partisan: Brazil have been playing with the pressure of an expectant nation . Efficient: Mats Hummels scored the only goal as Germany beat France 1-0 at the Maracana . BACK TO BASICS . Against Algeria in the last 16, Germany looked strangely vulnerable, despite having 23 shots at goal. They did not control the game as you would expect but against France they were much more solid. Philipp Lahm was moved back to where he belongs — at full back — and Jerome Boateng replaced Per Mertesacker in the centre to give their backline much more pace. That allowed Schweinsteiger to really dominate the midfield from deep, with Sami Khedira dropping in when needed. It was as well as they had played since the opening win against Portugal, so don’t be surprised if they line up that way again. Change: Phillip Lahm has reverted to full back, allowing Bastian Schweinsteiger to control the midfield . FLYING FULL BACKS . I don't know why Luiz Felipe Scolari played Maicon against Colombia instead of Dani Alves. In Alves and Marcelo, Brazil have two of the best attacking full backs in the world. Yes, they can leave gaps behind them but Scolari should be saying to Germany: ‘We are Brazil and we’re going to attack you. Can you deal with us going forward?’ Marcelo has so often provided an outlet for Brazil but he does need to concentrate. I don’t imagine Thomas Muller will start on the wing but the German forward will angle his runs — moving inside then out wide — to get in the space behind Marcelo. Pointing the finger: Marcelo trains with David Luiz at Brazil's training base in Teresopolis . On the run: Dani Alves trains with the Brazil team on Monday ahead of their semi-final showdown .

"An esteemed New York doctor may have tried to maliciously gain control of his wealthy widowed patient's estate, alleges a friend of the patient in a Manhattan civil suit.

Spears also claims that Dr. Moyer assigned abusive nurses who both mentally abuse and neglect his patient. Multimillion-dollar estate: The lawsuit filed by friend of the alleged victim Helen Schlesinger, Donna Spears, claims that Dr. Lawson Moyer illegally wrote himself into his patient's will . The New York Post reports Spears is claiming that Dr. Moyer broke the law by becoming both Schlesinger's primary care doctor and her power of attorney.

"All countries which banned their players from having sex at the 2014 World Cup have been eliminated, while those with a more relaxed view on the matter are enjoying better results on the pitch, research has shown. Germany and Holland bosses allowed wives and girlfriends to stay in team hotels and both have navigated their way safely into the quarter-finals of the tournament. Meanwhile, France, Brazil and Costa Rica who have more complicated rules regarding sex, but still allow it, also remain active in the competition as do Argentina, Belgium and Colombia whose preference isn't recorded. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Neymar's stunning girlfriend Gabriella sunbathes with friends . Secret of their success: Has Brazil's progress in the World Cup been down to a relaxed attitude to sex?

Of the sides that banned sex - Spain, Russia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Chile and Mexico - none made it past the last 16. Bosnia striker Edin Dzeko's failure to light up the World Cup could be attributed to time spent apart from his girlfriend Amra Silajdzic. Some managers have shown more of an interest than others. Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari hasn't banned it, but will monitor it. He said: 'The players can have normal sex during the World Cup. Usually normal sex is done in balanced way, but there are certain forms, certain ways and others who do acrobatics. We will put limits and survey the players.' Other coaches, such as Costa Rica's Jorge Luis Pinto, is happy for his players to engage in sexual activity as long as they winning on the pitch. He said: 'I can assure, with no doubts, they will be able to ""enjoy themselves"" just as soon as they qualify for the next round.' It was believed for a long time that sex has a detrimental effect on an athlete's performance, distracting them or exhausting them before a big match but more recent research showed that this was not the case with scientists claiming there is no physiological evidence to suggest this.

"Will Brazil win the World Cup without Neymar? Brazil has woken to realise it was not all a mind-bending dream of disturbing contradictions. Yes, the World Cup hosts are into the last four. And, yes, Neymar is out of the competition, injured in a quite innocuous incident at the fag-end of a chaotic quarter-final against Colombia. 'To win the Cup without him?' asked Fortaleza-based newspaper O Povo on its front page; a headline to accompany the image of Neymar being carted from the pitch in the city's Castelao Stadium. 'Gained but lost,' was another headline and 'Joy and Sorrow' declared Diario do Nordeste, with a split front page to mirror the ecstatic features of David Luiz after his goal from a free-kick, Brazil’s second in a 2-1 win, and the tragic early exit of Neymar prone on a stretcher with his face screwed up in pain. Agony: Neymar lies in agony after being kneed in the back just three mintues from the end . Stretchered off: Neymar is carried away by medics leaving all Brazilian fans in a state of panic . Carried away: Neymar was stretchered off the pitch and taken to hospital after Brazil's quarter-final win . There were detailed diagrams to explain how Brazil’s poster-boy had a tiny crack in the third vertebra, near the bottom of his spine, in more or less the area where Juan Zuniga connected with his knee. Outside in the streets of Fortaleza, the debris from a night of muted celebration was being cleared and market traders were adorning their stalls once again with replica Brazil shirts with 'Neymar Jr' and a No 10 emblazoned on the back. He seems set to remain the commercial force of the World Cup but Luiz Felipe Scolari must begin the process of finding a creative force to replace his playmaker on the pitch, ahead of a semi-final against Germany. Scolari must lift the spirits, convince the nation this campaign does not end with the exit of Neymar and a one-match ban for captain Thiago Silva, also ruled out of Tuesday’s game in Belo Horizonte. More than that, he must convince his team. The gloom descended as Brazil’s players shuffled through what is called the 'Mixed Zone', the area set aside by FIFA where players are made available for interview after each game. It is a snaking route like you might find at an airport or in a post office. The first to emerge told how they would pray for Neymar’s speedy recovery, how important he was to their progress. By the time the final ones trailed through, an hour or so later, the reports from the hospital were filtering though. Neymar was definitely out, according to Brazilian broadcasters as they buzzed around. The team doctor had confirmed it. This news was relayed to players as they were interviewed and the tone altered from one of hope and optimism to one of sadness and regret. Cynical: With the ball nowhere near Zuniga smashed his knee into the lower part of Neymar's back . Man down: The Barcelona forward falls to the ground after the challenge that rules him out of the semi-final . The damage: Brazilian television stations obtained an x-ray of Neymar's back and highlighted the broken bone . Welcome back: There were emotional scenes as Neymar was greeted by his team-mates upon returning to the base at Teresopolis . Oscar had already climbed aboard the bus and as he wakes this morning, he will find millions of hopeful eyes turning in his direction, just like when he carried the famous No 10 on his back, as he did until last year. Scolari 'demoted' Oscar to No 11 and the quiet and diligent Chelsea midfielder was forced wider to accommodate Neymar in the same way he was often forced out wide at Stamford Bridge until Jose Mourinho arrived and sold Juan Mata. Despite Mata’s brilliance over two years in London, Mourinho’s decision did not seem entirely absurd because Oscar started last season in wonderful touch. There were goals, assists and shimmies and feints, combined with wiry strength and an appetite to work hard and contribute defensively. As the season went on he faded, however, prompting the Chelsea manager to wonder aloud if he did not like the winter weather. There were flickers and moments of quality but Oscar could not reproduce his early-season form. He has scored only twice in the last 18 games for his club, two goals in the same game against Arsenal. Room for improvement: Oscar will be expected to step up in the absence of Neymar against Germany . Outshone: Oscar, pictured here in action against Colombia, has failed to hit top form like his compatriot Neymar . At this World Cup, too, he has been subdued. There was a 90th-minute goal against Croatia but he has been largely eclipsed by Neymar’s goals and public dazzle, even though giant billboard posters of Oscar with Calvin Klein pants and six-pack on display are a frequent sight around Brazil. This is the time to reclaim his place as playmaker for the Selecao. If they are to survive this setback and win a sixth world title in the Maracana, then they need Oscar to spark into life. Brazil needs the sublime and creative Oscar who marked his first Chelsea start with two magical goals in the Champions League against Juventus. He is still only 22, seven months younger than Neymar, who was the youngest Brazilian to carry the honour (or is it a burden, these days) of wearing the No 10 at a World Cup. Oscar will continue to wear No 11 but he must start to think again like a No 10. There is no doubt he has the craft and the vision although - more than an individualist like Neymar, he thrives on the movement of others around him: runners to thread passes to, team-mates on his wavelength to combine with. Expectation: Oscar and quarter-final hero David Luiz (right) have the weight of Brazil on their shoulders . Vision: The Chelsea midfielder relies on the movement of his team-mates to get the best out of himself . He certainly can threaten goal if he is moved into the centre as many expect he will be in Scolari’s enforced reshuffle, to play behind centre-forward Fred, with his Chelsea team-mate Willian and Bernard of Shakhtar Donetsk the leading candidates to come into the team. Brazil’s Chelsea connection will be strengthened if Willian gets the nod. David Luiz may be bound for Paris St Germain but he remains a Blue for the moment, and Ramires has made important contributions albeit mostly from the bench in Scolari’s team. The Londoners can lay claim to the fab four if Brazil achieve their dream, just as Arsenal claimed to be the driving force behind France’s world title in 1998 and West Ham with England in 1966. If that is to become reality, it is time for Oscar to step forward and deliver. To prove they can do it without Neymar. It is time for Brazil's other No 10 to step forward.","Neymar has been ruled out of the World Cup after suffering a broken bone in his back against Colombia .

"Oprah Winfrey’s love of truffles clearly knows no bounds. Just a few days after Instagramming a series of pictures of herself on a truffle hunt in Italy, the TV host turned up to top Miami restaurant Prime 112 with her own truffle in tow, before presenting the rare white truffle to the chef so it could be shaved over her Kobe Beef burger. One witness told the New York Post, 'Oprah not only rolls deep in a huge toe-crunching SUV and more security than the president, she also rolls with her own personal truffle.' Scroll down for video . Come prepared: Oprah Winfrey is seen leaving Prime 112 in Miami, Florida, where she reportedly asked a chef to add one of her own truffles to her meal . Just before dinner, the 60-year-old's driver accidentally ran over a woman's foot outside the restaurant, but fortunately no serious injuries were caused. The talk show host showed concern for the woman, immediately getting out of her Cadillac Escalade to check on her well-being. Oprah has been vocal about her truffle obsession in recent months. Magic mushroom: Earlier this month, Oprah enjoyed a tour of the Sabatino Tartufi Truffle factory in Umbria, Italy, which she called the 'best trip ever' on Instagram . Teamwork: Oprah's best friend Gayle King shared this photo of the talk show host with Ms King's daughter, Kirby Bumpus, on the truffle-hunting expedition . 'I’m a truffle freak,' she told reporters at the premiere of The Hundred-Foot Journey in August. 'I walk around with truffle salt. That’s on my rider for the hotels - truffle salt, truffle oil. I want to go to Alba [in Italy] and do the truffle hunt with the pigs,' she added. Earlier this month, she fulfilled that dream, traveling to Umbria, Italy, to hunt for the delicacy with her best friend, Gayle King, and Ms King's daughter, Kirby Bumpus.

Germany, of course, are managed by Joachim Low, Klinsmann’s friend and the man who served as his assistant when Klinsmann managed his home country in their own World Cup eight years ago. A draw will ensure both teams go through to the next stage, leaving Portugal and Ghana to fly home. Not surprisingly, conspiracy theories abound. Even the taxi driver taking journalists to the airport in Natal yesterday expressed the view that a cosy draw was in the offing. Klinsmann, for his part, has simply said the right things. ‘There is no time for friendship calls to Jogi,’ Klinsmann said. ‘This is all about business now. There will be no such call.

"Hull City look set to sign Norwich winger Robert Snodgrass after agreeing a fee with the club. Tigers boss Steve Bruce has agreed to match the club-record fee that brought former loanee Jake Livermore to the club on Wednesday, with an initial £7million rising to £8million. Scotland international Snodgrass, 26, who scored seven times in 34 games for the Canaries last season but could not prevent their relegation from the Barclays Premier League, has passed a medical at the KC Stadium . Deal: Hull City have agreed a £7million fee for Norwich and Scotland winger Robert Snodgrass . Determined: Snodgrass scored seven goals in 34 appearances for Norwich last season . International: Snodgrass has also scored three goals in 15 appearances for Scotland . He is eager to continue his top-flight career and is expected to undergo a medical and discuss personal terms in the next 24 hours. Sunderland had been linked with a move for the versatile Snodgrass, but were reportedly unwilling to match the fee offered by Hull. Should the former Leeds player become City's second summer signing it would provide further proof of the commitment shown by the club's controversial owner Assem Allam. Although he has courted the fans' ire with unsuccessful attempts to rename the team Hull Tigers, as well as unveiling a new badge earlier this month, he has also agreed plenty of big-money signings. Bruce has been allowed to break the transfer record several times since winning promotion, first with Tom Huddlestone's £5.25million capture a year ago, then in January when Nikica Jelavic and Shane Long came in for up to £7million each. Livermore has already raised the bar again and Snodgrass would equal that mark. Snodgrass has scored three goals in 15 internationals for Scotland.

"A brave toddler who needed 70 percent of her lung cut out after being born with a rare congenital condition has started nursery despite now facing the removal of a diseased kidney. Two-year-old Emily Norris, of Bowthorpe, Norwich, required the emergency surgery after a chest infection in 2012 and the illness has now spread to her right kidney. But amazingly - the resilient toddler, described by her mother as 'incredible' and 'a ball of energy' recently attended her first day at Costessey Pre-School in Norwich. Brave: Two-year-old Emily Norris, of Bowthorpe, Norwich, pictured with her mother Nicki Pybus . Her mother, Nicki Pybus, 26, said: 'Emily's absolutely fantastic - we're all so proud of her. Starting school is a huge step forward. 'Giving Emily her own little bit of independence is scary in a way - but seeing her go to Costessey Pre-School and loving it is amazing.' Ms Pybus was first made aware of complications during a 20-week pregnancy scan - when doctors noticed a mass on the baby's lung and advised her to consider termination. She added: ''That was never an option for me. I thought it was down to her - if she wanted to be born and wanted to thrive then that was up to her.' Despite the mass on her lung, Emily was remarkably born without complications and was able to breathe perfectly.. But when she turned four months old and picked up a chest infection she was rushed into hospital on Boxing Day 2012. Ms Pybus said: 'They said there were cysts on her lung and in the end they spread to take up 70 per cent of her right lung. 'She was admitted to Norfolk and Norwich Hospital for two and a half weeks, then sent home. Rare illness: Emily was born with a congenital condition affecting her right lung - 70 per cent of which has had to be removed . 'But the cysts grew so much she went from being monitored to doctors saying the mass needed to come out.' Emily had been struck down by the very rare condition congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung. The stricken infant was transferred to London's world-renowned Great Ormond Street Hospital to have the diseased slice of her lung removed. During the two weeks in hospital, Ms Pybus had to leave her older children, Jake, seven, and Dominic, three, with her family.

First day: The toddler recently had her first day at at Costessey Pre-School in Norwich - but sadly her illness has spread to her right kidney, which will also have to be removed . While the mass on Emily's lung was big enough to be picked up on early scans, the cysts on her right kidney were only discovered later - news that devastated Emily's family. Ms Pybus said: 'She will have to have her kidney removed as well. Doctors said they had seen the condition before, but they had never seen it happen to two organs in the same person. 'But for a child that has been through so much Emily's just so happy and smiley. 'She smiles at all the doctors and nurses at the hospital, even though they are going to prod and poke her. 'She gets out of breath and we will have to watch out when she's more active, but by the time she's at high school, her lung should be able to compensate. 'Emily's just incredible. She's a little ball of energy, but I constantly worry. 'No matter how well she's doing, there's always something to worry about.

"A Bengal tiger snatched a man off a fishing boat in eastern India, dragging him away into a mangrove swamp as his children looked on in horror, according to his son. The attack happened on Thursday as Sushil Manjhi and his son and daughter were crab fishing in a stream in the Sunderbans National Park. The tiger leaped aboard the boat and clamped its jaws on Manjhi's neck, said Sushil's son, Jyotish. The tiger 'quickly flung my father on his back and gave a giant leap before disappearing into the forest,' said Jyotish from his village of Lahiripur in West Bengal state . Scroll down for video . Tiger in the water: A Royal Bengal tiger prowls in Sunderbans, at the Sunderbans delta, near where the incident happened . 'Shortly after we reached the spot, around 7am, we got a whiff of a strange odour. We immediately decided to turn back to a safer zone,' Jyotish told The Times of India. He told the newspaper they paddled towards a less dense area when the tiger struck. 'Suddenly, my sister cried out: ""Dada, bagh (tiger)"". I was stunned, and my body froze. All I saw a flash of yellow. It took me a moment to register the gruesome sight before me. My father was completely buried under the beast,' he said. He said he and his sister tried to beat . the animal with sticks and a knife, but the thrashing had no effect. His . father was dragged away and was presumed dead. The national park is one of the largest reserves for the royal Bengal tiger. Thursday's attack was the fourth deadly assault by a tiger this year in the Sunderbans, according to wildlife officials. India has more than half of the 3,200 tigers believed to be left in the wild in the world. But as the country undergoes breakneck development to accommodate the growth of its 1.2 billion people, tiger habitats have been shrinking. The big cat's numbers have also dwindled because of rampant poaching to feed a flourishing market for tiger organs and bones in China.","Tiger said to have flung man on his back and then disappeared into forest .

"Gary Lineker claims England are ‘a generation behind’ Germany as Joachim Low’s team attempt to win the country’s fourth World Cup against Argentina.

Expert opinion: Former England striker Lineker has been in Brazil covering the World Cup for the BBC . On Sunday Germany will attempt to win the World Cup for the fourth time in their history against Argentina in the Maracana. The former England striker said: ‘When you look to Germany, they have always managed to get it right.

Hot property: Toni Kroos is one of Germany's standout players and has been linked with Manchester United . Leader: Thomas Muller has already scored 10 World Cup goals in his first two tournaments . In reserve: Andre Schurrle has proven an effective substitute for Germany . Talent: Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is as adept with his feet as many of the outfield players . ‘A couple of defeats and you are gone - that’s the danger of World Cups. ‘There was huge disappointment, but at the same time we all knew before this tournament that most of our players were too young and very inexperienced and our experienced players were perhaps a little bit too mature. 'The truth was realised, but at the same time we weren’t that bad in the games. There was a bit of promise. 'I don’t think it was as depressing as four years ago when you couldn’t see much future. Whereas with this bunch in two years time, four years time there is reason for hope.’ 'We are addressing issues. It’s unbelievable that it’s only in the last two or three years we’ve started with small sided pitches and small goals. Finally we’ll get kids trying to pass the ball to each other rather than lump it up to the other end of the pitch. 'At least it’s here. And the academies are getting better coaches. Kids are learning to play. That’s why we’re seeing an emergence. That’s why we’re seeing the Under-17s and Under-20s doing better in international football.

Next generation: Ross Barkley is among a number of talented English youngsters . New look: Adam Lallana is a recent and exciting addition to the England set-up . 'With the emergence of the Sterlings and Barkleys and the Sturridges and the Lallanas and the Wilsheres – players than can actually play, and keep the ball, there’s reason for hope. ‘There aren’t too many countries in the world where you’ve three organisations running the game. ‘It doesn’t help because they’re all in a bit of a fight for power. Ultimately if we can develop enough players, the balance of foreign players isn’t great, but that’s because we’re not producing enough players. ‘Most clubs would actually like homegrown players because they’re a lot cheaper. We could do with one or two managers giving the homegrown youngsters a chance, like Brendan Rodgers has done at Liverpool.

"Qatar have revealed the design for the second of its 10 brand new stadiums being built ahead of hosting the World Cup in 2022. The Al Bayt stadium in Al Khor City, just over 30 miles north of the capital Doha, is expected to be ready by 2018, well ahead of schedule to host the tournament in eight years time. Preliminary work has already begun on the extravagant arena, the design of which is based on Bayt Al Sha’ar, a traditional black-and-white tent used by nomadic people in Qatar.

The area surrounding the venue will feature space for local businesses and restaurants, as well as landscaped paths to be used for exercise.

"Spaniard Carlos Velasco Carballo wore the referee's kit, but he wasn't in charge for this quarter final in Fortaleza. The refereeing at this World Cup has been consistently lenient. Teams will have noted that and now know that they have a licence to foul, particularly gifted opponents like James Rodriguez. Time and time again the dangerous Rodriguez was blocked, tripped and body checked. Yet, Paulinho and his Brazil team-mates escaped sanction. What the Tottenham man has to do to get a yellow card at this tournament I do not know. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Neymar wheeled through hospital by worried staff . Furious: Colombia's defender Juan Camilo Zuniga argues with Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo . Fouling: Paulinho was a constant offender but was not booked by the referee . Ouch: Fernandinho was another who emerged without a booking despite making several fouls . Even when Colombia got a free-kick in a promising position, Carballo ignored the Brazilians charging the ball down from perhaps six yards. A caution for the defender and a retake was the correct decision. With the hosts a goal up but facing a determined Colombian side they elected to ignore the beautiful game and resort to foul tactics to progress to the semi-final. The second half of a promising game deteriorated into a petty ugly affair in which Carballo was happy to award free-kicks but nothing else – until it was too late. Frustratingly when Rodriguez committed a minor foul, he was cautioned adding fuel to the fire that Brazil are enjoying every perceived advantage of being a home team. If this continues they must surely lift their sixth World Cup. That David Luiz scored the winner from the free-kick added insult to injury. Finally: Julio Cesar and Thiago Silva were booked as the referee eventually got tough with hosts Brazil . Paying the price: James Rodriguez fouled Hulk for the free kick that led to David Luiz's goal . In the book: Rodriguez was also booked as Colombia were sent crashing out by the hosts on Friday . While Carballo did nothing to impress his assistant worked well and rightly flagged for offside to disallow Mario Yepes effort. It is hard to give Carballo any credit for finally giving a decision against Brazil when Julio Cesar hacked Carlos Bacca down. Carballo made his name in La Liga for being a strict disciplinarian but FIFA instructions have clearly affected a number of referees in this tournament and it is highly unlikely that will change in the remaining six games. The question now is whether the referee for Brazil’s semi-final will be strong enough to ensure fair play – and that referee could well be Howard Webb.","54 fouls were recorded during Brazil's 2-1 World Cup 2014 semi-final victory over Colombia .

"There have been plenty of spectacular catches in Twenty20 cricket but Trent Boult's effort for New Zealand against West Indies tops the lot. Boult was standing on the boundary when West Indies' Kieron Pollard mowed Corey Anderson into the leg-side.

Boult's effort is possibly even better than the catches taken by the Aaron Finch/Adam Lyth combination for Yorkshire this summer. They teamed up to great effect against Lancashire in the Roses match, with Lyth taking the ball on the boundary and throwing it to Finch as he headed over the rope. And the roles were reversed last week against Leicestershire, when it was Finch who did the initial work and Lyth took the catch. That one was even better. But are either better than Boult's stunner?

"When Suzanne Shaw married Peter Cook on the back of his tumultuous divorce with supermodel Christie Brinkley, she chose to ignore the warnings. But in a complete reversal, Shaw has now written to Brinkley to personally apologize for not heeding her cautions about Cook's philandering. Cook's marriage to Brinkley collapsed in a very bitter and public divorce trial in 2008 following revelations he had an affair with his 18-year-old assistant Diana Bianchi. While Bianchi, now 29, has since gone on to marry a New York writer, Shaw has divorced from Cook and written a letter to Brinkley to try and mend their rift. Scroll down for video . Christie Brinkley, 60, ended her ten-year marriage to architect Peter Cook when she found out about his year-long affair with the then 18-year-old Bianchi . Peter Cook and Suzanne Shaw pictured together at the annual Hampton Classic Horse Show last year . Fight in court: Christie Brinkley is escorted by court officers as she arrives at New York State Supreme Court for the beginning of her divorce trial against Peter Cook in 2008 . According to the New York Post, the letter stated: 'Christie and I have talked recently and I have privately apologized to her, but, given the public nature of their divorce and custody battle, I feel a public apology is also appropriate and deserved. She added: 'Christie was wrongly vilified as being an embittered ex-wife. 'I’m deeply sorry for my part in causing Christie any unnecessary pain.' Meanwhile, the woman at the centre of the split between Christie Brinkley and Peter Cook six years ago has married. Diana Bianchi, 29, was just 18 when architect Cook hired her as an assistant before seducing her in 2005. The exposure of the affair between Cook and Bianchi ended his ten year marriage to supermodel Brinkley in  very public divorce proceedings in 2008. Happy: Diana Bianchi, 29, who was at the centre of the Brinkley-Cook divorce, has married  Aaron Arizpe . Bianchi has now married food writer Aaron Arizpe from New York, and changed her last name. 'She was just a kid when [her affair with Cook] happened,' a family friend told the New York Post. 'She was a teenager. But things change, people change, they mature. She couldn't be happier now, and we're really happy for her.' Bianchi, who was the daughter of the Brinkley-Cooks' neighbour, had a year-long affair with Cook which started in 2005 when Bianchi was 18 years old and working as his assistant. Brinkley was told of the affair in 2007 and ended their ten-year marriage which saw her and Cook embark on a very public court battle. The other woman: Diana Bianchi, pictured at the Brinkley-Cook divorce trial in 2008 . During the 2008 divorce, the court was told that Cook had paid Bianchi $300,000 in the hope she would keep the liaison quiet.

"It was not so long ago that Brendan Rodgers was saying he had been made a better manager, and a better person, by Luis Suarez. He was talking, firstly, about his unquestionable talent as a footballer but, more importantly, Rodgers referred to the inspirational power of Suarez’s personal growth last season. So Liverpool’s manager has every right to feel cheated , as do a lot of other people. And not just cheated out of his best player for close to three months at the start of next season, either. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the shocking moment Suarez bites Chiellini and more . Personally cheated: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers had said Luis Suarez had made him a better person . Down and out: Luis Suarez has been banned from all football activity for four months . Homeward bound: Suarez will return to Uruguay and play no further part in the World Cup . Goodbyes: Uruguay's Luis Suarez is seen embracing a member of the coaching staff on a balcony at the team's hotel in Natal . The consequence of Suarez’s behaviour runs far deeper than mere professional inconvenience. FIFA . were correct to mete out a punishment that reached beyond the . boundaries of  international football when Suarez bit an opponent for . the third time in his career, playing for Uruguay on Tuesday. Yet, for Rodgers, the betrayal does not stop there. He has been personally cheated, too, because he invested emotionally in what we now know was a lie. Like . many in the English game, from the dressing-room to the press box, he . was fooled into thinking he had witnessed one man’s capacity to change . for the better. He . thought he had seen a journey, an epiphany, a powerful redemption. He . thought  he was a better person, a  more valuable person, for the . rehabilitation of Luis Suarez. He had helped. He was of use. And now it . all seems false. Events . in Brazil this week will cast a shadow over the advances made by . Liverpool last season, because it will be a while before the club can . trust again. The footballer can be replaced - although not like for like - but not the faith. All for nothing? Rodgers thought he was more valuable for rehabilitating Suarez but now it all seems false . If . Suarez goes one month, one season, one year, unblemished, what does it . mean, what will it matter? He will work a lifetime trying to put right . his behaviour at this World Cup because everything he says, or does, . from here will be met with scepticism. No . one will buy the sham of a reformed Suarez any more. No one will judge . the performances, without also considering the man. For all the cant . from several quarters about a vendetta in the British media, Suarez won . the Football Writers’ Footballer of the Year Award at the end of last . season, having started it suspended for biting Chelsea’s Branislav . Ivanovic. As Rodgers remarked in a speech on Suarez’s behalf, it is part of British nature to forgive. VIDEO Suarez actions bad for everyone - Sanchez . Flashpoint: Suarez holds his teeth in pain after appearing to bite Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 1-0 win . Referee! Branislav Ivanovic explains what happened after Suarez appeared to have bitten him back in 2012 . Suarez . was a popular winner. He was respected and admired, not just for the . exceptional quality of his play, but for his new maturity. It . is not just X Factor voters who are suckers for a moving back story. Suarez had grown from a dark soul, a player who did and said the most . despicable things, to one who embodied the game at its finest. He . has always played beautifully but now had a serenity to match. No . diving, no biting, no vile words designed to wound. He made the people . believe. And then, when they were at their most trusting and vulnerable, . he revealed it was all an act. Fooling us all: Suarez's bite on Chiellini reveals the frontman's good behaviour last season was all an act . Stellar season: Rodgers (left) said it had been a privilege to work with Suarez after the frontman scooped the Football Writer's Player of the Year award (right) There . will be predictable howls at FIFA’s punishment and its extension to his . club career. Suarez, after all, was not banned from playing for . Uruguay when suspended by the Football Association. Yet the FA is an . organisation under the umbrella of FIFA. The  bigger body can pass its . rulings down, the smaller body cannot pass its rulings up. It . is unfortunate that Liverpool, who have worked so hard at reforming . Suarez’s unpalatable excesses, are now punished beside Uruguay - who have done nothing but indulge and excuse him, and shamefully so since last Tuesday. Yet what else was there to do? The . evidence was plain. If Suarez has not transgressed in English football . since the Ivanovic incident it is only because the FA have threatened . draconian punishment. What option did FIFA have, then, other than to adopt the same policy? A . ban from international football alone would not have stopped a . potential move to Real Madrid or Barcelona this summer. Indeed, the . absence of regular commutes between Europe and South America would . almost have made Suarez more appealing. Unfortunate: Liverpool have worked hard to help reform Suarez but are now being punished . And . what message would that send if a player who had brought the World Cup . into disrepute then became the most expensive signing of the summer? FIFA had to include Liverpool in their reckoning if any penalty was not to become worthless. Is . it enough? Some might even argue he has got off lightly. The ban from . all competition could have lasted two years, according to FIFA’s rules. In the circumstances, certainly the recidivism, four months  globally . and nine games in internationals, seems fair. It . is harsh enough to hurt Suarez, not so ferocious that it destroys his . career. It leaves room for rehabilitation, enough time for the player to . change, to grow, to be redeemed. Whether . anyone is interested in viewing this sequel is another matter. Disbelief can only be suspended so far even in horror show audiences. Dracula has risen from the grave? Not this time, bub.","Luis Suarez has been banned for nine matches and banned from all football for four months by FIFA .

"Three penalty appeals - which the referee does not feel are enough on their own to award a spot kick - should not add to a penalty kick but that’s what appeared to benefit Arjen Robben and Holland in Fortaleza. Ref Pedro Proenca is used to players exaggerating and simulating in his native Portugal. He even knows Robben from Champions League matches and he appeared to be prepared to wave aside theatrical falls during the game. The penalty which was given came from poor defending from the experienced Rafael Marquez, who from his days at Barcelona should know better than to put his leg in the way of a player like Robben. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the fall and falls of Arjen Robben . Tumble: Robben goes over and the Portuguese referee awards a penalty deep into injury time .

First claim: Hector Herrera took a boot to the head after challenges from Stefan de Vrij and Ron Vlaar . Penalty shout: Hector Moreno looked to catch Robben in the penalty area as he challenged for the ball . VIDEO Dutch party rumbles on . A case can be made for a penalty but for me the way that the Dutchman dives with legs flying out behind him would stop me giving that penalty. There was a much clearer incident which should have resulted in a penalty for Holland just before half time when Robben was perhaps caught by Marquez but then wiped out by Hector Moreno. Mexico themselves had a clear penalty when Hector Herrera was through on goal and Ron Vlaar flew in with a high boot to stop the Mexican. Decider: Marquez appeals after Robben goes down for the late penalty that won Holland the game . Big call: Robben tried to jink around Marquez but appeared to be caught by Mexico's captain . Difficult decision: Mexico appeal - in vain - after Robben went down to win the stoppage time penalty .

High risk: Marquez was booked for the challenge that saw Proenca award a late penalty to Holland . Two on one: Rafael Marquez and Moreno were both involved as Robben went down in the area . Ouch: Robben reacts after the challenge but he could not convince the referee . Decision: Proenca elected not to award the Mexicans a penalty for this challenge by Ron Vlaar . Head shot: Herrera went down under the tough challenge but the referee deemed it not a penalty . It had to be seen as dangerous play and . in such situations if there is physical contact then a direct free kick, . or penalty if it occurs in the 18 yard box, should be given. There was another penalty appeal in the 67th minute when Robben (naturally) threw himself to the ground but Proenca rightly waved the appeals away. They say cheats never prosper but when referees merely wave aside dives insead of cautioning the cheat, then they will dive and dive again and often, as in this game, eventually ‘win’ penalties which are so crucial. Painful: Herrera falls to the ground as Vlaar looks on but no penalty was given by the referee . Still not happy: Robben and Proenca have a chat during the first half cooling break .

Fernandes made clear at the start of the season, at the announcement of his driver line-up car for this year in January at Caterham's Leafield base, he was threatening to pull the plug. Via a demoralising outburst, Fernandes said: 'My message to the 250 people here (at the factory) is we have to go for it this year. This is it - the final chance. 'We've given you the best infrastructure, the best potential drivers, but it is now down to all of you to go and do it. 'If we're at the back I don't think I'm going to carry on.

"Britain will overtake France to become the second-biggest economy in Europe behind Germany next year, the International Monetary Fund has said. It predicts growth of 3.2 per cent in the UK this year and 2.7 per cent in 2015, compared with just 0.4 per cent and 1 per cent in France. The estimates mean output in Britain will total £1.9trillion next year – outstripping the £1.8trillion France is expected to produce. However, the UK still lags behind Germany’s £2.4trillion economy. All smiles: By next year, Britain's economic output is set to top £1.9trillion after growing by 3.2 per cent this year and 2.7 per cent next year, outstripping the £1.8trillion France is expected to produce, . The figures, in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook, will be a boost for George Osborne. But they are an embarrassment for Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has closely aligned himself with France’s socialist president Francois Hollande. Mr Hollande swept to power in 2012 as an old-fashioned socialist, promising to take on the rich and big business, but is now the least popular French leader on record. The economy remains in a rut – France has been labelled ‘the sick man of Europe’ – and unemployment is 10.5 per cent, compared with 6.2 per cent in Britain. Chris Williamson, chief economist at research group Markit, said France was being held back by its ‘increasingly bloated public sector’ with government spending among the highest in the world at 57 per cent of total national output. France is the biggest country in the EU, with a population of about 67million – compared with 64million in the UK. In 2009, the French economy was worth £1.7trillion compared with £1.4trillion in the UK, according to IMF figures. But the Fund, whose managing director Christine Lagarde and chief economist Olivier Blanchard are French, is now expecting Britain to stretch ahead. France, the largest country in the EU, is being held back by a 'bloated public sector', according to the IMF, and huge public spending under socialist President Francois Hollande (pictured) It is expected to be the fastest-growing major economy in the developed world this year. And by 2019 it is forecast to be worth £2.3trillion while French output is set to total £2.1trillion, according to the IMF. The German economy is forecast to be worth £2.8trillion in 2019. The IMF this week slashed its growth forecasts for the eurozone and said there is a 40 per cent chance of recession. Meanwhile, George Osborne yesterday called for ‘fiscal discipline’ across Europe as he warned there was no such thing as ‘a free lunch’. The Chancellor said he was sceptical about calls for extra public spending at a time when many countries were struggling to balance the books. His warning came as stock markets across Europe tumbled amid fears of recession and Japan-style deflation. The FTSE 100 index sank 91.88 points to 6339.97 in London – its lowest close for a year. France and Italy have urged the EU to relax its budget rules, while the IMF has called for more spending on infrastructure. But Mr Osborne said: ‘You can’t then go breaking the rules at the first test.’","UK output predicted to be £1.9trillion next year against France's £1.8trillion .

"It's been a painfully slow courtship, but the United States may finally have fallen in love with the game it calls soccer. They have been coming to World Cups for decades, but never has their battle cry 'I believe that we will win!' been so fervently sung. It has been adopted as the nation's catchphrase as millions of fans - some new converts to soccer, others veterans - have followed the progress of Jurgen Klinsmann's team with an infectious enthusiasm. Scroll down for video . Main man: Jurgen Klinsmann watches with a smile as his United States team train in the sunshine of Salvador ahead of their World Cup last-16 meeting with Belgium .

With President Barack Obama leading the star-studded cheer squad, the American nation will again be entranced on Tuesday night as the US take on Belgium in their last-16 clash in Salvador. For the first time, there is genuine belief that Team USA can beat anyone in their path and that confidence was much in evidence as they trained on the eve of the match in the sunshine at Roberto Santos Stadium. Klinsmann, the coach who has done so much to accelerate the development of soccer in the States during his three-year tenure, stood smiling as his players whizzed around him in a blur. The mood was upbeat, energetic, confident, a squad happy to be considered the underdogs and thriving on it. They emerged from the group when few expected them to - beating Ghana, coming within seconds of beating Portugal and narrowly losing to Germany, one of the tournament favourites.

Stopper: Goalkeeper Tim Howard practises his kicks during the training session held 24 hours before the last of the eight second round ties . Things won't exactly get easier against Belgium but Klinsmann, a World Cup winner with West Germany in 1990, has instilled such a self-belief that they do genuinely believe they can win. 'We made it out of a difficult group and now every game is 50-50,' the coach said. 'We need to be spot on, right now, give everything we have. I am confident that if every player gets to his limits tomorrow we will have a positive outcome. 'We started a process three years ago, we see a lot of things developing on many fronts, but you know you get judged by how good the outcome is in the World Cup.' The Us will certainly have excellent backing in Salvador. More American fans have travelled to the World Cup in Brazil than any other nation outside South America, while hundreds of thousands have been watching on big screens set up in major cities back home.

In Chicago, for example, after more than 20,000 supporters gathered in Grant Park to watch the Germany match on a big screen, plans have been made to open up the 61,000-capacity Soldier Field for an outdoor screening of the Belgium game. Soccer invading the backyard of American Football, by popular demand. Nationwide, 25 million tuned in for the Portugal match, a new record for televised soccer in the States. That will almost certainly beaten by the Belgium encounter. 'You can't stop it anymore, the sport is breaking through in the United States,' Klinsmann added. 'It is coming through at every level, there are kids playing it anywhere, but the recruiting office is the national team, in every country. This is a cool moment right now, but we have to take advantage of it. 'The support back home means a lot to us.

Klinsmann doubles up as the technical director for US Soccer, overseeing the development of the country's youth team as well. His son Jonathan is a member of the under 18 squad. He is encouraged by the progress being made - 'millions of kids playing soccer throughout the country, it is going to another level' - but his steely focus is very much on the present. 'We are not thinking at all about the future right now, we are thinking about the present and we want to go far', he said.

"On Thursday night in Lausanne, Switzerland, three sprinters broke the 10-second barrier for the 100 metres: Justin Gatlin, Tyson Gay and Mike Rodgers. Gatlin’s 9.80secs was the quickest time in the world this year. It should have been a cause for celebration, but it left only a  sickening, churning feeling. There is little entertainment in watching sport when you do not care about the winner. All three sprinters, after all, have returned to track and field after serving drugs bans. All three have never said ‘sorry’. They just swanned back into the sport and let their fast times do the talking. Three cheats: Gatlin, Rodgers and Gay all ran under ten seconds on Thursday after serving drugs bans . Example: Gatlin poses with young fans after setting the fastest time in the world this year . A near-capacity crowd in Lausanne applauded, kids queued for autographs and the world just stood back and watched it happen. Athletics is so desperate for heroes — particularly in a year in which Usain Bolt has yet to light up a track — that its marquee event has been reduced to a circus. Thursday night was an evening that shamed the sport. Gatlin was given an eight-year ban that might have been life after failing a second drugs test in 2006, but saw it cut to four years —  giving him ample time to come back and win 100m bronze at London 2012. He referred only to his ‘indiscretions’, then spoke about his ‘struggles’, ‘stresses’ and the ‘journey’ he has been on. Anyone would think he was the victim, rather than the perpetrator. Gay adopted a similar tone about his year away from the sport, grassing up anyone he could to receive a back-dated, 12-month ban for testing positive for anabolic steroids three times last June. Unrepentant: Gatlin has never apologised for his doping offenses which say him banned for four years . VISITED the wonderful Olympic museum in Lausanne, where Britain’s Desiree Henry’s name is etched on the steps after she helped light the flame at London 2012. Henry, now 18, then ran in the Athletissima meeting that evening. There’s Olympic legacy for you. WATCHED Petra Kvitova’s stunning display to win the Wimbledon singles title, then realised a 55-minute, one-sided final played right into the hands of those who do not think women merit equal prize money. The sport badly needs more rivalries and personalities. THOUGHT how wonderful it was to hear people casually chatting about cycling thanks to the beautiful pictures from the Tour de France. It’s a sport which can get bogged down with technicalities, but a trip to Yorkshire worked wonders for bringing it back down to earth. Funny, that. We will probably never know exactly how Gay ‘helped the authorities’ to gain such an apparently lenient sentence, but one thing is for sure: it did not involve accepting any accountability. Rodgers, too, initially provided ‘inaccurate and misleading testimony’ after testing positive for a banned stimulant in July 2011, before finally ‘accepting full responsibility’ and a nine-month ban that ended conveniently before the 2012 US Olympic trials. Rodgers has since also morphed back into the sport. The thing that really grates is the utterly brazen, swaggering attitude to such flagrant breaches of the rules. The return to four-year bans for ‘serious doping offences’ in 2015 should help, but at the moment cheats seem to drift in and out of the sport apparently at will. They are there in almost every race, with their illegally-won honours scratched out and the dirty dollars in prize money reluctantly handed back, ready to go again without a word of explanation to the world. It stinks. Hero: Men's sprinting has welcomed cheats back into the fold, perhaps because of a lack of other options . Admiration: Fans will warm to Gatlin and his fellow cheats despite their bans, if they keep running fast . The BBC received 172  complaints after commentator Mark Lawrenson (right) said Switzerland’s Josip Drmic ‘should have put a skirt on’ after a particularly weak shot at goal. I don’t know about sexist, I’d say it was just plain stupid: it’s an absolute hassle attempting to do any kind of sport in a skirt, Lawro. Athletics is caught in a cycle of self-harm, whereby each positive drugs test drives another nail deep into the  the sport, yet must be exposed to send out a message that cheats will never prosper. These same cheats are then largely welcomed back with apparently open arms — as long as they keep running quickly. I am not such an idealist as to suggest nobody deserves a second chance. Young, ambitious athletes can make mistakes and more experienced competitors can put their trust in the wrong people, but humility must follow such transgressions. There must be some acceptance that what they did was wrong. Otherwise, the vital trust between spectator and athlete will continue to be eroded. VIDEO Gay back from drugs ban . Other way: Chambers, who won the British title again last week, has apologised for his drug use . Reigning British 100m champion Dwain Chambers also served a doping ban, but the sickening feeling that followed Gatlin’s win in Lausanne did not greet the 36-year-old’s victory in Birmingham eight days ago. The only arrogance left in him is a sprinter’s deep belief in his own ability. He cheated, he was caught, he told the truth and now, more than a decade on, he is still winning and winning clean. There is something admirable in that. Yet Chambers is still lumped in with the Gatlins and Gays of this world, the ‘former drugs cheats’ whose deceit continues to rile. And the really sad thing is we largely let them get away with it.","Gatlin set world's fastest time of 9.80secs on Thursday .

"Jose Manuel Barroso walks away from his role as President of the European Commission with a pension worth more than £100,000-a-year, it emerged today. The Brussels chief, who has opposed demands from Britain for radical reform of EU migration, will enjoy the annual pay check provided he remains 'loyal' to the European project. Tory MPs condemned the 'greed and arrogance' of EU fat cats, and urged David Cameron to 'put them in their place'. Scroll down for video . Jose Manuel Barroso retires as European Commission President with a pension worth more than £100,000-a-year . After demanding Britain pay an extra £1.7billion to EU coffers, Mr Barroso is also in line for a generous 'transitional allowance', travel and moving costs and a month's salary to help him adjust to life outside Brussels. Mr Barroso has repeatedly clashed with Mr Cameron, frustrating his attempts at EU reform. In a farewell speech in London last week, Mr Barroso warned Britain's hopes of restricting migrant numbers would 'not be in conformity with European laws'. And on Thursday it emerged that deays before he stands down, the Commission had ordered the UK to pay an extra £1.7billion for its EU membership. The Commission issued the demand after using rules dating back to 1995 and finding Britain's economy has grown faster than expected, so must pay a greater share to Brussels. To add insult to injury, France will receive a £790million rebate because its economy is struggling. Furious Mr Cameron hit back insisting it was an 'appaling' way to behave, and warned the move made it harder to justify Britain's membership of the EU. But Mr Barroso brushed aside the 'concerns in London' and insisted 'sometimes these decisions do happen' Details of the remuneration of outgoing commissioners show the generous payments Mr Barroso can look forward to. He is entitled to an annual pension worth 4.275 per cent of the basic salary for every full year in office. His monthly salary of €25,554.58 ( or £20,188.12) means his annual pension pot after 10 years in office will be £103,562. Pension experts said someone paying into a normal pension would have to build up a pension fund worth £3.6million to secure such generous annual payouts. Tory MP Stewart Jackson told MailOnline: 'This doesn't surprise me. The British people are fed up with the greed and arrogance of unelected EU fat cats like Barroso. 'It's time the UK flexed it's muscles and David Cameron took a lead in putting them in their place.' Conservative Peter Bone said: 'It's a joke isn't it. All this does is add to the growing numbers of people who want to take us out of the EU. 'What it looks like, and what it is, is an elite who pay themselves what they like, don't listen to the British people and don;t take decisions in the national interest.' Mr Barroso will also get a 'resettlement allowance' of one month's basic salary and 'travel expenses and moving costs are reimbursed', according to the European Commission website. David Cameron has clashed with Mr Barroso over immigration and a demand for Britain to pay an extra £1.7billion . A transitional allowance is also paid for three years, beginning on the day after leaving office. This allowance is between 40 and 65 per cent of his £242,000 annual basic salary, and is subject to European Union tax. The transitional allowance can be capped but only if he takes up a new job, and his new salary plus his allowance means he is earning more than a member of the Commission. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, told the Sunday Times: 'It's ridiculous that the European Union hands out lavish perks for ex-officials one day and then demands more money from Britain the next. 'Both voters and the business leaders who create jobs in the UK will find President Barroso's lecturing particularly grating, given that we're paying him to promote the EU for the rest of his life.' A spokesman for Mr Barroso said: 'All information on commissioners' salaries and entitlements, including pensions, is public. We never do bespoke calculations, or check figures prepared by others when it comes to the precise remuneration or pension of named individuals. 'The commission does not set the terms of commissioners' salaries and entitlements; the member states do.'","Generous perks for European Commission President as he stands down .

"This week it was revealed that teachers are currently using training packs which suggest sex as young as 13 is ‘normal.’ The ‘traffic light tool’ which was sent out to schools up and down the country by sexual health advice service Brook also suggests that masturbation and kissing are  OK between children as young as nine. But how does losing your virginity at 13 really affect you? We spoke to one woman, who wished to remain anonymous, who said that it was one of the worst things that could ever have happened to her. Scroll down for video . Is 13 too young? Two teenagers kiss on the floor of a bedroom (picture staged by models) Now an adult, she explained that as a young girl she entered into a relationship with an older teenager and it was only in later life that she realised that their sexual behavior was wrong. She said: ‘I lost my virginity at the age of 13. At the time I had an 18-year-old boyfriend who I thought was the epitome of cool because he used to pick me up from school on his motorbike. ‘We were together, on and off, for almost three years in the end, and I always used to describe him as my first love. ‘That was, until I grew up and fell in real, adult love, and realised that all I ever had with him was a case of extreme infatuation.’ The woman - who was outraged when The Family Education Trust bought the ‘traffic light tool’ to the public’s attention - explained that the sex was planned and that she was on the pill at the time. ‘I definitely didn't have sex because all my friends were doing it, and it wasn't really a social-climbing exercise either, but I did want my boyfriend to stay with me.' However, that didn't stop her riding an emotional roller coaster that she feels she would have been better equipped for had she not been so young. ‘When we did, inevitably, split up on numerous occasions the emotional fallout was unprecedented. I would weep for days in my room, refuse to eat and obsess over whichever girl it was that he'd dumped me for that time. ‘It was unhealthy and borderline unhinged, but then, I was only 13 years old.’ Having heard the latest news she is adamant that young children should not be taught that sex at such a young age is normal. ‘I have a 15-year-old niece now, and she's still such a child in my eyes. The idea of an older man convincing her to have sex with him makes my blood boil, and she's two whole years older than I was when I was doing just that. The age of consent varies massively around the world, from 13 to 20... ‘My mum knew about what I was doing at the time and whilst I don’t blame her entirely I do wish she'd tried to reason with me, perhaps told me that I didn't need to have sex with a boy to keep him interested.' Our case study says that having sex so young skewed the way she viewed relationships. ‘Being in an intimate relationship at such a young age definitely made me see sex in the wrong way. ‘For many years after I broke up with my first boyfriend, I didn't have much self-respect and slept with quite a few people that I wish I hadn't. ‘I was simply not emotionally mature enough to deal with a sexual relationship and, while I don't necessarily regret the person I chose to lose it with, I do 100 per cent regret doing it so soon.’ She went on to say, ‘Children should definitely NOT be taught that sex at 13 is normal. The age of consent is in place for a reason. ‘I think it would be good to be taught more about the emotional side of a sexual relationship as well as just the mechanics and scaremongering. ‘Yes, you might get an STI or even pregnant, but what about the psychological damage to your young teenage mind. ‘It's a tough enough time already without adding those woes to the list. Children should be allowed and encouraged to stay young for as long as possible – we're all growing up far too fast these days. ‘Save sex for the right person AND the right time.’ The Brook 'Traffic Light Tool' states that for children as yoiung as 13 'green behaviour' includes 'consenting oral and/or penetrative sex'","The Family Trust lead uproar as children are being taught sex at 13 is OK .
