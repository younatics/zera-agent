"By . Lorraine Candy . For the past two weeks I’ve been working away from home. I’ve been at ‘the fashions’, as a colleague’s young son calls the bi-annual catwalk shows of Milan and Paris. It’s written in my contract that I attend these runway collections, it’s business and I am obliged to be away. This means my husband is in sole charge of the four children, aged two to 11. It’s Mr Candy’s turn in the hot seat at air-traffic control: he’s wrestling with the dreaded domestic to-do list alone. Lorraine Candy: Should I be worried? Should I quit my job and stay within a five-mile radius of the kitchen to safeguard my marriage? Will everyone survive the triple school-run to get in on time? Will homework get done, hair get brushed, uniforms washed and  hamsters fed? Will veggies get eaten and fizzy drinks be rationed? Will he leave me when I get back? This week I’ve learnt that apparently modern men resent being used as ‘daddy day care’. According to some they dislike it so much they hot-foot it out of a relationship, join internet dating sites and reveal their best body part is ‘their bum’. At least that seems to be the consensus of judgmental opinion I’ve read on the recent split between TV presenter Susanna Reid and her partner of 16 years Dominic Cotton (the man with the good bum). Columnists gleefully appeared to collude in the ridiculous view that it just wasn’t on for a working mum to expect her partner to take on equal childcare. How dare Susanna tackle a tough commute to work at BBC Breakfast, devote further time to training for Strictly Come Dancing, and then expect Dominic to be responsible for their three boys in her absence, the commentators crooned, as the news that Cotton was single and looking for love online broke. They concluded Cotton left because he resented his temporary role as house husband, that being the primary carer is really the woman’s job. This kind of thinking is illogical. Equal parenting is indisputably the most efficient way of organising childcare when both parents choose to or need to work. None of us know the reason Reid and her partner parted (it’s none of our business frankly) but to blame her career for the split is nonsensical. At least that seems to be the consensus of judgmental opinion I've read on the recent split between TV presenter Susanna Reid and her partner of 16 years Dominic Cotton (the man with the good bum). So should I be worried? Should I quit my job and stay within a five-mile radius of the kitchen to safeguard my marriage? It never crosses my mind  — as I head for the airport for my short business trips and hand over control of the fearsome foursome —  that Mr Candy may then feel the need to exchange me for a less demanding model. Can he cope in my absence? Of course he can, he is a man not a pot plant (no one asks if I’m going to be able to cope when he goes away for work, no one thinks I’ll resent the responsibility). He isn’t any less capable just because he hasn’t got a womb or his hair is shorter than mine. In fact, he seems to enjoy his rare mum-free existences. When I get home the little fellas have all but made ‘Daddy Does It Best’ badges. He doesn’t parent the way I do given his haphazard time-keeping — with Mr Candy routine is suspended, bedtimes are flexible, baths negotiable and the toddler often goes out in her PJ bottoms instead of her leggings — but that’s half the fun for the children. They adapt to his way of doing things and I silence my inner control freak to overlook the fact they have probably had Tesco pizza for tea three days in a row. I haven’t been ‘lucky’ as some imply when they witness Mr Candy’s willingness to help out, I’ve been logical. We knew children would be hard work so we defined a way of doing it we think works for us. Logic with a lot of love thrown in. And on the plus side, my husband revels in the ‘superhero’ status bestowed on him by some of the other mums while I am away. ‘He’s so good, isn’t he?’ one mum once said to me as if his appearance at the  playground was as rare as a Nando’s black card. ‘He’s just a man,’ I replied, ‘doing the school run. Nothing unusual about that.’Lorraine Candy is editor in chief of Elle magazine.","Modern men resent being used as ‘daddy day care’

"By . Erin Clements for MailOnline . Model Ginta Lapina has filed a lawsuit claiming that hair care company Schwarzkopf and her agency, Women Management, misled her into doing an advertising campaign, telling her the shoot was for Karl Lagerfeld. The 25-year-old, who has starred in campaigns for Anna Sui, DKNY and Jill Stuart, says she flew to Paris in July 2013 for what she was told was a photo shoot by Mr Lagerfeld that would accompany an interview with the legendary designer. She was surprised to discover that the images were actually used in an advertorial, and is seeking more than $1 million in damages as well as a court order prohibiting Schwarzkopf from using her pictures. Model behavior: Ginta Lapina has filed a lawsuit claiming that she was misled into doing an advertising campaign for Schwarzkopf after being told the shoot was for Karl Lagerfeld . She also alleges that Women Management arranged the deal with . Schwarzkopf without her knowledge or consent, and that she was paid . $19,700 for her time, but not compensated for the use of her images. 'The Schwarzkopf Look 2014 Trends advertorial was NOT [billed as] an advertising campaign, and therefore, the models were compensated only for their time for the photo shoot but not for the usage of their image,' says the suit, filed in Manhattan Federal Court. The Chanel creative director, who often shoots his own campaigns, did photograph the advertorial, which appears on Schwarzkopf's website. Status update: Ms Lapina, pictured in the advertorial (right), says the deal has 'diluted' her brand, because Schwarzkopf is not of her caliber . The Latvian-born model, who married 49-year-old businessman Adam Hock in 2012, says she is accustomed to being solicited for campaigns by clients 'willing to pay a model a high-six figure sum.’ Furthermore, the deal has 'diluted' her brand, because 'Schwarzkopf products and look of advertisement are not of the caliber normally endorsed by a model of plaintiff Ginta's stature in the industry.' 'In sum, Defendants conspired to obtain a top model for an advertising campaign without having to pay the usual and customary compensation that a top model commands,' claims the suit. Camera man: Karl Lagerfeld did shoot the advertorial, though Ms Lapina says she was told the photos would be used for an interview with the designer . The suit also notes that Models.com ranked Ms Lapina 27th in a list of the highest-earning models this year. Women CEO Sergio Leccese told the New York Daily News that he was 'surprised and disappointed' by the suit, adding: 'We deny any and all allegations of wrongdoing and intend to seek all appropriate remedies in connection with these issues.' MailOnline's request to Schwarzkopf for comment was not immediately answered.","Ginta Lapina alleges that Schwarzkopf is not of her caliber and has 'diluted' her brand, paying her far less than the six-figure sum she usually commissions .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Food packaging could soon feature a label that changes colour to let you know if it has gone off. A British company today launched the smart labels that 'activate' when a package is opened and change colour using a traffic light system to indicate whether the contents are still safe to eat. Pre-packaged foods like ham or cheese need to be eaten within a certain number of days of being opened - even if they are still within the use-by date. Fresh thinking: The label changes from brown, to orange, to purple, depending on how edible the food still is . It is hoped the smart labels will cut food waste by preventing customers throwing out food they wrongly believe has gone off. A typical Brit throws away around £700 worth of edible food a year, often because they are being over-cautious with open packets in the fridge. Professor Andrew Mills invented the technology for the 'smart plastic' when he worked at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow and has spent five years refining the idea. The labels were launched today by Insignia Technologies, who say they have had interest from retailers and supermarket chains in the UK, France and America. Each one will add around 2p to the cost of a packet of food. Experts are also working on similar systems for fresh fruit and vegetables, food and drink in jars or bottles, and cosmetics such as mascara or contact lens solution. Prof Mills, now a professor in Materials Chemistry at Queen's University, Belfast, said: 'It is a huge development for consumers and for the food industry. It has got real potential. 'We have all gone to the fridge and thought ""I can't remember how long ago I opened that"", and we err on the side of caution and tend to throw it away. Naughty... but is it still nice? Labels will ensure you know food is still OK to be eaten once it has been left in the fridge for a while . 'This indicator is focused on how long the package has been open. This is vital to prevent good food being thrown away. 'It would reassure you that it's only been open for a day, and it is fine to eat. 'Anything that makes a dent into food waste is a good thing. The levels of food waste areunsustainable. 'It's also brilliant for frozen foods that have been defrosted, as then the best before date doesn't apply. Look familiar? For most people, a fridge this full is a rare sight - but perhaps not for much longer . 'This has the potential to make a very big difference to the way we use packaged goods, whether foods or other materials.' The labels work with foods that have been packaged in a modified atmosphere using carbon dioxide (CO2). Each features a central disc bordered by three segments - a brown one for 'just opened', an orange one for 'use soon' and a purple one for 'past best.' When the packet is opened, the CO2 released triggers a timer in the label so it begins changing colour. It can be adjusted by varying the thickness of a special film covering the label so it will turn purple for 'past best' at between two and seven days. Insignia Technologies' chief operating officer Stephen Currie said: 'It's all systems go. I think it is fantastic. It is a real, genuine innovation for the food packaging sector. 'It is something which can help restore shoppers' confidence.' The company, based in Newhouse, Lanarkshire, Scotland, received backing from Scottish Enterprise and private investors. It is also working on developing a similar system using stickers which can be applied to items such as fruit, cosmetics or even pharmaceutical drugs. Delicately flavoured goods such as coffee and spices could also benefit, as consumers could use the system to tell if they still taste their best.","Label begins to change colour once the packet is opened .

"BET has suspended a producer over the joke and have publicly apologized . By . Carolyn Hiblen for MailOnline . Karrueche Tran has found herself at the centre of an uproar after making fun of Jay Z and Beyoncé's daughter, Blue Ivy. Co-hosting Monday night's episode of 106 & Park, Chris Brown's model girlfriend took aim at the two-and-a-half-year-old's hair. And the dig certainly didn't go down well with fans of the superstar couple, who were quick to slam the 26-year-old for the decidedly low blow against an innocent child. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Karrueche Tran found herself at the centre of controversy during a guest-hosting gig on 106 & Park on Monday night after she joked about Jay Z and Beyoncé's infant daughter Blue Ivy's hair . During a segment with co-host Brandon Broady, the pair reflected on the previous evening's MTV VMAs, with Broady introducing 'the top six things Blue Ivy thought about the VMAs'. Karrueche then delivered the line: 'I really did wake up like this because my parents never comb my hair.' Obviously immediately regretting the scripted diss, she awkwardly giggled before adding: 'Sorry Blue, I love you!' But it wasn't good enough for fans, who took to Twitter in their droves to call her out on the mean-spirited 'joke'. 'I really did wake up like this because my parents never comb my hair': The two-and-a-half-year-old, who appeared on stage with her famous parents during Sunday night's MTV VMAs, was the butt of a mean-spirited joke delivered by Tran . Low blow: The adorable little girl looked absolutely gorgeous with her hair worn in natural curls as she hit the stage in her father's arms to present her mom with the Vanguard Award . Twitter user @caitlynanala wrote: 'Karrueche Tran making fun of Blue Ivy's VMA hair is a testament to not only her irrelevance, but her desperation! Lmao.' 'The fact that BET had @karrueche throw a jab at blue ivy's hair on 106&park. & they wonder why they can't get Beyoncé to perform live,' commented @briiitea. 'As a human being w/ a brain, it's also a bit worrying that @Karrueche would bully 2-year-old Blue Ivy on @BET. You are not a puppet, right?' asked @KennethWareJr. Attempting to defend herself, Karrueche hit back: 'Now y'all know I LOVE me some Beyoncé and Blue Ivy! I didn't write this script y'all lol,' later following it up with, 'I am definitely team #BeyHive.' Rookie mistake: Chris Brown's 26-year-old girlfriend and co-host Brandon Broady's gag went down like a lead balloon, with the model giggling awkwardly before apologising, 'Sorry Blue, I love you!' Script change: Karrueche was said to be mortified following the incident, with both she and her manager fuming that she was put in that situation, the punchline apparently having changed since earlier rehearsals . A source close to Tran tells TMZ she simply read the joke verbatim off the teleprompter, the script apparently having changed since rehearsals. She insists she didn't see the joke beforehand and was mortified afterwards, with both she and her manager going 'nuclear' because they too felt the comment was in 'poor taste'. Speaking to TMZ, Karrueche admitted she actually admires the child's hairstyle, saying: 'I love that Blue is able to wear her natural hair.' BET President Stephen Hill also issued an apology via Twitter, in which he revealed that he had reached out to Beyoncé and Jay Z and is taking 'punitive actions' against the producers who put the guest host in that unfortunate position. Hitting back: Tran attempted to defend herself, taking to Twitter following the show to explain that the gag was scripted and not her idea . Showing the love: She also made this comment as she insisted she's a huge fan of Blue's famous mom, Beyoncé . Over four messages he wrote: 'Last night on 106 & Park there was a stupid, unthoughtful joke made about a young child. 'We apologize publically to the child's parents (and have done so privately) and we have taken punitive actions with those responsible (sic). 'It was very bad judgment and we will serve you much better in the future. 'Oh, and please don't hate on Karrueche; it was NOT her fault. We also apologize to her for putting her in that position.' BET is understood to have suspended a producer of the network's music video countdown show for the remark.

"By . Daniel Miller . New Ukrainian Defense Minister Valeriy Heletey has pledged to retake Crimea from Russian control . Ukraine's newly-appointed defence minster has pledged to to retake Crimea from Russian control promising a victory parade in the key city of Sevastopol. The parliament in Kiev erupted with cheers following the remark made by Colonel General Valeriy Heletey, 46, a former policeman who previously headed the state's VIP bodyguard service. Heletey was recommended for the position by President Petro Poroshenko as someone who would work day and night to revitalise Ukraine's armed forces. In his address, Heletey, who replaces Mikhailo Koval, said: 'Believe me, there will be a victory parade -- there will be for sure -- in Ukraine's Sevastopol.' Russian troops annexed Crimea, home . to a Russian-speaking majority, in March following a widely-disputed . referendum in which 96.7 per cent reportedly voted to become part of . Russia. It comes as government troops continue their bloody offensive against pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine who have declared independence and occupied government buildings. Ukraine and the West say Russia is helping arm the rebels and letting its citizens cross the border to fight, while key allies France and Germany are pushing Poroshenko to pursue talks over attacks. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a conference call yesterday during which they appealed to him to put pressure on the rebels in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. President Poroshenko said he was prepared to order a ceasefire providing it was observed by both sides, all hostages were freed and borders secured by government forces. Poroshenko also appointed Lieutenant . General Viktor Muzhenko as chief of the military's general staff and . Yury Kosyuk, an agriculture magnate and one of Ukraine's richest men, to . oversee defense issues in the presidential administration. Heletey was recommended for the position by President Petro Poroshenko, right, as someone who would work day and night to revitalise Ukraine's armed forces . He told the parliament: 'Today the revival of the army is starting from the scratch, the army which is capable of fighting and winning. 'I have witnessed that during meetings with soldiers and officers while visiting the zone of anti-terrorist operations - the army which knows how to and is able to defend its people and country,' he added. Ukrainian astronomers have named a star 'Putin is a D**khead' in a jibe aimed at the hated Russian president. The star was adopted and named through the Pale Blue Dot Project, which allows anyone to adopt and name a star for just $10, with the money going to fund the hunt for Earth-like planets. The co-ordinates of star which is officially named 'Putin Huilo' are: Celestial Star: right Ascension: 18 h 59 m 47.09 s Slope: 46 * 26 '44', 'magnitude: 11. The term Putin Huilo is belived to have been coined by football fans and was widely chanted at matches, before being picked up by rock bands and becoming a popular internet meme. It was widely shouted during the Maidan protest in Kiev which resulted in the ousting of President Yanukovych and his government. Kiev has struggled to re-assert control over the country's industrial east, where fighting between government troops and pro-Russia separatists has claimed more than 400 lives since April. The army has been unable to prevent rebels from occasionally cruising the countryside in armored vehicles or to dislodge them from the occupied town of Slovyansk. Yesterday three Ukrainian traffic police officers were shot dead after unknown gunmen wearing camouflage uniforms opened fire. The incident took place near the main railway station in Donetsk - the largest city in eastern Ukraine, where clashes between government troops and pro-Russia separatists are ongoing. At least 250 civilians, almost 200 soldiers and at least 800 rebels have been killed in eastern Ukraine since April. According to figures released by the UN at least 110,000 people have left Ukraine for Russia this year, the majority from eastern regions. The insurrection started after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was driven from office by a protest movement among people wanting closer ties with the European Union instead of Russia. Russia called Yanukovych's ouster a coup by radical nationalists and seized Ukraine's Russian-speaking Crimea region. Ukraine says Russia is now backing the insurgency. Poroshenko was elected in a special election May 25 to replace Yanukovych.","Former policeman Valeriy Heletey, 46, has been brought in to revitalise army .

"By . Daniel Miller . Updated: . 11:22 EST, 3 October 2011 . A psychiatrist may be pushing his own sanity to the very limit after working an average of 110 hours a week throughout an entire year. Dr. Quazi Rahman, 55, a psychiatrist at Kings County Hospital, New York, earned $515,700 in overtime during 2009 and claims on one occasion to have worked for 96 hours straight. With a base salary of $173,503 it means Rahman took home a total of $689,203 from the public purse in a single year. Dr Quazi Rahman worked an average of 110 hours a week throughout an entire year, earning $515,700 in overtime during 2009 . Time sheet records show on one occasion he clocked up 141 hours in a single week, leaving him less than four hours a day off. The documents, obtained under the Freedom of Information Law, show Raham, worked a total of 3,820 hours overtime during 2009. It . means he almost tripled his working hours by putting in an additional . 73 hours a week, on top of his regular 40-hour schedule. In one period starting on March, 2, he is reported to have worked 55 days in a row without a single day off. Then . during a week in April he managed to top even that by toiling for 141 . hours straight, including four non-stop days working 24 hours solid. But he was far from finished, racking up 116 hours the following week and 130 hours more the week after that. (picture posed by model) Rahman was able to work for hours non-stop by taking naps when things at the hospital were quiet . However following an investigation by the New York Post the city Health and Hospitals Corporation checked his time sheets and discovered 80 hours worth of discrepancies. He was ordered to hand back $10,800 and pay an additional $10,800 penalty. Official said that as a precaution they would review the time sheets of other staffers in the department. However the HHC defended Rahman claiming the money that was overpaid was most likely the result of a coding mistake. They said Rahan was capable of working the mammoth shifts by sleeping on the premises when things were quiet. HHC spokeswoman Ana Marengo told the Post: 'He consistently worked 15 hours a day and sometimes more, which is not uncommon for some physicians during parts of their career, particularly if they can be on call. 'Although the hospital is generally busy, his on-call responsibilities in the inpatient unit allowed him periods of rest when there was down time.' During 2010 Raham's overtime fell to a mere 1,959 hours meaning he earned just $438,000 after the hospital recruited additional psychiatric staff.","New York shrink worked an average of 110 hours a week for an entire year .

"By . Mario Ledwith . and Paul Thompson . Millionaire: Christopher Tappin, 65, always maintained his innocence, saying he was a victim of an FBI sting. He pleaded guilty in November last year and has been sentenced to 33 months in prison . A retired British businessman who fought a long battle against extradition has been jailed for 33 months for smuggling arms to Iran by a court in the US. Christopher Tappin, 65, pleaded guilty to selling missile batteries  in return for a reduced sentence at the trial in El Paso, Texas. He is likely to spend six to nine months in the US before being sent back to Britain to complete his sentence, his lawyer said. In a statement, Tappin apologised for his actions and said he looks forward to returning home to be near his sick wife. Tappin, from Orpington, Kent, will begin his sentence at Allenwood prison in Pennsylvania, to start by March 8. He had fought a two-year battle against extradition after originally denying the charge. But in November he pleaded guilty to charges of arms dealing at a court in El Paso. The plea bargain meant Tappin escaped a possible sentence of 35 years in prison. Tappin, a former president of the Kent Golf Union, was also fined £7,095. US District Judge David Briones told a court hearing that Tappin should be allowed to serve his sentence in the UK . but the decision ultimately rests with the US Bureau of Prisons. His lawyer said it would be several months before he could be repatriated. 'The prison system moves incredibly slow, so he will be there for several months,' said a source at the US Justice Department. His wife Elaine Tappin said she hoped the jailed businessman would have 'the mental fortitude to cope with whatever lies before him in the months and years to come'. Mrs Tappin, who is seriously ill with chronic Churg-Strauss syndrome, a . rare auto-immune disease, was unable to attend the hearing. Following the sentencing, she said: 'Now I can begin to see light at the end of this long dark tunnel - but remain frustrated that Chris' extradition was granted in the first place. 'Being returned to a US prison will be dreadful for him. He is learning to live with the regrets - it is a chastening experience after a 45-year unblemished business career.' The couple have been married for 38 years and have a son and daughter. Mrs Tappin added: 'I pray that the US and UK authorities between them will expedite Chris' repatriation to Britain - so we, and his friends, are able to visit him in prison.' Separated: Tappin, with his wife Elaine, before being handed over to the US to face the arms dealing charges . Jail: The maximum-security Otero County Prison Facility where Tappin was previously held. He was originally kept in isolation for up to 23 hours per day . She vowed to lobby the Government to . change the law in favour of domestic prosecution over extradition, . saying that she has been 'dismayed' by the current system. She added: 'The cost is too often . either unnecessary, disproportionate, or both. We cannot change what has . happened to Chris, nor to those who have gone before him, but we can . take steps to stop unwarranted extradition being imposed on others. Tappin previously denied attempting . to sell batteries for surface-to-air missiles which were to be shipped . from the US to Tehran via the Netherlands and claimed he was part of an FBI sting. Before the 'plea bargain', he faced . the prospect of 35 years behind bars in a high-security prison, and no . prospect of return to the UK to serve his sentence. His lawyer in the UK previously indicated her client had little choice but to accept a deal. Karen . Todner, who also represented computer hacker Gary McKinnon, said: ‘The . odds are so heavily stacked against a defendant who chooses to plead not . guilty and then is subsequently found guilty that the vast majority of . people facing trial in the US opt to take a plea agreement.’ The case followed an investigation which began in 2005 when US agents asked technology providers about buyers who might have raised red flags. Those customers were then approached by undercover companies set up by government agencies. Tappin admitted that between December 2005 and January 2007 he knowingly aided and abetted others in an illegal attempt to export oxide reserve batteries, a special component of the Hawk Air Defence Missile, to Iran. Released: Christopher Tappin was released after being bailed to live with lawyer Dan Cogdell in Montgomery County, near Houston . Far away: Chris Tappin with his wife Elaine pictured in his home in Orpington, Kent, before he was extradited to the U.S. By pleading guilty, he waived his right to appeal against his conviction or challenge the sentence handed down in this case. His associates Briton Robert Gibson agreed to co-operate and was jailed for two years . after pleading guilty to conspiracy to export defence articles. He also . provided customs agents with about 16,000 computer files and emails . indicating that he and Tappin had long-standing commercial ties with . Iranian customers. Their US contact, Robert Caldwell, served 20 months . in prison. Tappin was held in prison for two months following his extradition in February, and then granted $1million (£650,000) bail. Tappin dealt with a front firm called Mercury Global Enterprise, but . claimed the batteries, worth around £5,000 each, were going to be used . in the car industry.

"By . Ian Ladybourn, Press Association . Leeds coach Brian McDermott will be aiming to help lift the weight of history from the shoulders of his ageing stars when he leads them out at Wembley on Saturday. McDermott is a former Cup winner with Bradford but his old Bulls team-mate Jamie Peacock is the only member of the Rhinos team to have experienced the joy of winning rugby league's famous knockout trophy and that was away from Wembley. Kevin Sinfield, Danny McGuire, Rob Burrow, Ryan Bailey and Jamie Jones-Buchanan have formed the nucleus of the Leeds team that won Super League's Grand Final at Old Trafford a record six times as well as the World Club Challenge three times in the last decade but are still waiting to put the final piece in the jigsaw. Holy grail: McDermott (right) and Kevin Sinfield will be hoping to lead Leeds to glory on Saturday . Leeds are appearing in their 24th Cup final - only Wigan with 30 have more final appearances - and are looking to win it for the 12th time but a seventh defeat in the last 14 years would set a new record of 13. Most of the neutrals at Wembley are sure to be supporting underdogs Castleford but few would begrudge Sinfield and company reaching their Holy Grail. 'That's my job,' McDermott said. 'And if I can deliver it, it would mean a fair bit to me. 'I've listened to them all talk about it. I don't think they go searching the streets for answers or looking in the stars because they've all by their own right been very successful in everything except the Challenge Cup. 'It's the missing piece in the jigsaw and I know it means a lot to them. If I can deliver that, I'd be over the moon. I'd be over the moon for myself as well.' Since they last lifted the trophy at the old Wembley in 1999 , with a 52-16 win over London Broncos, the Rhinos have lost finals in 2000 (Bradford at Murrayfield), 2003 (Bradford at Cardiff), 2005 (Hull at Cardiff), 2010 (Warrington at Wembley), 2011 (Wigan at Wembley) and 2012 (Warrington at Wembley). Touching distance: Leeds have failed in each of their last six attempts to win the famous trophy . McDermott has been at the helm for Leeds' last two defeats but it has not dulled his enthusiasm for the 117-year-old competition. 'That novelty never wears off,' he said. 'There's a lot of ceremony involved compared to a Grand Final, where you feel like you could turn up in your jeans and flip-flops and it would still be a big event. 'There's a fair bit of protocol you've got to go through at Wembley. I suppose as a young player or coach, it's a bit of a pain in the a***, you think 'let's get on and play'. 'But when you get older - and some of these lads have been in a few - you start to enjoy it, start meeting a few people. You know you are on show and that you are representing our sport.' Despite their losing habit at Wembley, McDermott is hoping his side's big-match experience will count for something against Daryl Powell's Castleford, who won at Wigan in the quarter-finals and recently held Leeds to a draw in Super League at Headingley. Last man standing: Jamie Peacock is the only member of the Leeds side to have won the Challenge Cup . 'I don't think it will give us a massive edge but it certainly helps us in preparation and, if you can get on the field and feel a bit more confident because of the preparation you've had, it gives you an edge,' McDermott said. 'But, when the whistle blows, I don't think Cas will be too bothered about how many finals we've appeared in. 'We lost at their place in 2013 and this year had two very challenging games. I am sure they will be confident - they broke us down a couple of times in both those games, so it's on. 'What we're not doing is planning for a team that chokes. Cas won't choke, I guarantee it. They won't get there and freeze. We're planning for a good Cas.'","Leeds have lost six finals in last 14 years .

"By . Adam Shergold . Ross McCormack started the repayments on his £11m transfer fee with the goal that may well have saved Felix Magath’s job as Fulham edged this spicy west London derby. There were plenty of raised eyebrows when the striker arrived from Leeds United but he gained instant hero status at Griffin Park with a second-half winner. Trading passes with Chris David, McCormack slotted the ball home left-footed from a tight angle to sink Brentford and settle a highly entertaining Cup tie. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Top 10 Ross McCormack transfer memes . Off the mark: McCormack slots home for his first goal since joining Fulham from Leeds for £11million this summer . On the run: Jota attacks for Brentford who will be keen to concentrate on League matters after this Capital One Cup defeat . Brentford: Button 6; Odubajo 5.5, Tarkowski 6, Dean 6, Bidwell 6.5; Tebar 6.5, Dallas 6, Toral 6.5 (Diagouraga 62, 6), Jota 6.5 (Gray 74, 5), Smith 5; Proschwitz 6 (Hogan 73, 5) Subs: Bonham, Reeves, Moore, O’Shaughnessy .

And nobody would have been more relieved that Fulham’s German manager, who was fearing for his future after a dismal start to life back in the second tier. The Scot was thrilled too. Feeling a weight lifted from his shoulders in opening his account, he booted an advertising board as he celebrated in front of the delirious travelling fans. These two rivals had not met in a competitive fixture since April 1998 and though Griffin Park was a long way short of capacity, the atmosphere crackled on a soggy west London evening. Brentford could not have picked a better time to face their foes from five miles down the road. Fulham’s miserable year has not improved with dropping down a division, with four successive defeats from the season’s start leaving them rock bottom of the Championship and manager Felix Magath fighting for his job. Not that stopped him tinkering with his team. He had already deployed 22 players in those four matches and there were five changes here from the side that capitulated at Derby on Saturday. Mark Warburton evidently agreed with the need for change in the Cup, making six alterations from the side that drew with Birmingham. The game started at a frenetic pace, with Brentford’s Jake Bidwell showing intent down the left-hand side to force a couple of early corners and further spark the crowd. Fulham, though, saw the first clear opening when Tim Hoogland’s 25-yarder fizzed narrowly over David Button’s goal, before £11m man Ross McCormack failed to steer Chris David’s whipped cross on target with his head. Relief: McCormack celebrates his goal at Griffin Park as he finally begins to show why Magath asked Fulham to spend so much money on the striker . Under fire: Felix Magath's position at Fulham is under threat after his side's slow start to live in the Championship following Premier League relegation last year . At the other end, Tommy Smith powered a header over from a Jota corner kick before Brentford enjoyed their best opening of the first-half. A clever training ground free-kick routine saw Jota unleash a fierce angled shot that Marcus Bettinelli knocked away with one fist and brilliant reflexes. This was a game that simply refused to settle. It was fast and furious, with attack and counter-attack. Another long-range hit from Hoogland skidded into the hands of Button, before Cauley Woodrow criminally blazed over from six yards out after Kay Voser’s cross had found him unmarked. On the stroke of half-time, the lively Jota wriggled into the box and smashed a low drive against the post with Bettinelli well beaten. Fulham’s defence was caught napping shortly after the break when Moses Odubajo crept in behind and drilled a dangerous ball across the face of goal. McCormack stormed through on to Voser’s pass and swept the ball past Button but the joy of his first Fulham goal was cut short by an offside flag. However, he didn’t have to wait too much longer for his moment as everyone of a Fulham persuasion finally had something to smile about.","Former Leeds striker scores only goal to see off Brentford after clever interplay with Chris David .

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . The UK's top anti-terror police officer has said today that 'significant progress' has been made in the hunt for the UK jihadist who murdered American journalist James Foley. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley appealed for help in rooting out aspiring home-grown terrorists as he decried the 41-year-old's 'pitiless' death at the hands of Islamic extremists in Iraq. Islamic State terrorists posted a video online last week of the horrifying murder of hostage Mr Foley at the hands of a killer who spoke with a British accent. Making progress: The UK's top anti-terror police officer, Mark Rowley, (left) has said today that 'significant progress' has been made in the hunt for the UK jihadist who murdered American journalist James Foley (right) Today Mr Rowley, the UK's leading counter-terrorism officer, said: 'Every reasonable person in the country has been touched by the pitiless murder of James Foley at the hands of Islamic State terrorists, and the murderer's apparent British nationality has focused attention on extremism in the UK as well as the Middle East. Investigators are making significant progress.' He appealed to family members and friends of would-be UK terrorists to come forward, stressing that nearly half of potential jihadis identified as part of Syria-linked investigations had not previously been classed as dangerous. Mr Rowley said that counter terrorism police had recently arrested a 19-year-old man in Camberwell, who was charged with engaging in conduct of preparation for terrorist acts, and is now awaiting trial. He added: 'Another young man, previously unknown of as a terrorist risk, was arrested last week on suspicion of planning to leave the country to travel to Syria for terrorist acts. He remains in custody. Shocking: Islamic State terrorists posted a video online last week of the horrifying murder of hostage Mr Foley at the hands of a killer who spoke with a British accent . 'The biggest growth in Syrian related investigations has occurred in London and the West Midlands. The growth of dangerous individuals poses challenges for policing, especially when nearly half of Syria travellers of concern were not known as terrorist risks previously.' In the first half of this year 69 suspected extremists who planned to travel to Syria or fund terrorism there were arrested, and five times as many suspects are being arrested now compared to 2013. 'High priority operations, especially against those involved in attack planning or on the cusp have increased greatly,' he said. 'Port stops and cash seizures have grown by over 50per cent as we strive to disrupt terrorists. 'The biggest growth in Syrian-related investigations has occurred in London and the West Midlands. The growth of dangerous individuals poses challenges for policing, especially when nearly half of Syria travellers of concern were not known as terrorist risks previously. Journalist: Mr Foley pictured working in Syria in August 2012. Mr Rowley described the death as 'pitiless' 'Hence, we appeal to the public to help identify for us aspiring terrorists - they may be about to travel abroad, have just returned or be showing signs of becoming radicalised.' Scotland Yard investigators are currently having hundreds of pieces of terrorist content linked to Syria removed from websites including YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Mr Rowley said the force is also trying to prevent hate crimes here that may be sparked by events abroad, for example anti-Semitic offences related to Gaza and crimes against Muslims over the actions of Islamic State. He added: ""There is a lot at stake. In addition to the public assistance in identifying potential terrorists, we all need community and religious leaders to continue to speak out against warped narratives and we need everyone to ensure that public debate does not give oxygen to the terrorists by giving them the publicity they seek.' Earlier this month Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe warned it cannot be predicted when potential terrorists might decide to return to the UK from countries such as Iraq and Syria, and police are preparing in case of an influx. It is estimated that around 500 Britons have travelled to Syria to fight alongside extremists there, of whom around half are thought to be from London. However, during a visit to India Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg rejected calls for tougher measures to combat the threat posed by returning British jihadists. Anger: London Mayor Boris Johnson (right) said he wants Mr Foley's murderer, who has become known as 'Jihadi John' (left) to be killed in a bomb attack . London Mayor Boris Johnson said he wants Mr Foley's murderer to be killed in a bomb attack and joined the growing calls for Britons fighting abroad to be stripped of their citizenship. But Mr Clegg said: 'We actually have a number of measures already on the statute book which allow us to keep a very close eye on those people who aren't in prison, aren't sentenced, but nonetheless are perceived to be a threat to the United Kingdom. 'And of course, we will continue to review all the powers on the recommendation of the police and security services that may be deemed to be necessary to deal with this very serious issue. 'I sometimes wish it was as simple as Boris Johnson implies: all we need to do is pass a law and everything will be well.' Writing in his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson said those who 'continue to give allegiance to a terrorist state' should lose their British citizenship, and called for swift changes to the law so there is a ""rebuttable presumption"" that those visiting war areas without notifying the authorities have done so for a terrorist purpose. He wrote: 'Young men such as this killer are famously told that if they die in 'battle' they will be welcomed in heaven by the sexual ministrations of 72 virgins. 'Many of them believe it - even though scholars have suggested that the reference to ""black-eyed virgins"" is in fact a promise of 72 raisins. 'I suspect most of us don't give a monkey's what happens to this prat in heaven, whether he meets virgins or raisins - we just want someone to come along with a bunker buster and effect an introduction as fast as possible.'","Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley appeals for help to root out terrorists .

The injury would rock Arsenal's title hopes just two games into the new season with Alexis Sanchez and Yaya Sanogo to call upon to fill the centre forward role. Manager Arsene Wenger said in a press conference that Giroud would see a specialist on Wednesday, and despite not categorically ruling out the Frenchman for any length of time, Wenger admits he is sad about the news of an injury, which he claimed could be long-term. Wenger ruled Giroud out of Wednesday's Champions League play-off second leg with Besiktas, saying: 'He will not play.' 'For the rest, he will see a specialist in England tomorrow (Wednesday) and after we will make an announcement of how long he will be out. Lone man?

Lukas Podolski was thought to be heading to Juventus but a loan move is now in doubt, while Wenger may need to strengthen the frontline further. Yaya Sanogo was in good form in pre-season, scoring four goals against Benfica in the Emirates Cup, but Wenger refuses to panic just yet and is still looking ahead to the Beskitas clash.

Perhaps what she didn’t expect was an unorthodox move from the chap alongside her as he swept in to steal a kiss. Scroll down for video . Cheeky: Pippa laughs as her friend appears to lean in for a kiss on the cheek at the Swiss ski resort in Gstaad . Grainy footage posted on the internet shows him apparently planting one on our future queen’s little sister as she enjoyed herself at a disco with some cringe-makingly dreadful dance moves. The film was taken at the Palace hotel in Gstaad, where Pippa and her boyfriend Nico Jackson earlier had box seats to watch a match in the Hublot Polo Gold Cup Tournament, a celebrated magnet for the fabulously rich and famous. Yesterday the video was generating interest from around the world as various websites posted links to it, including one that raised the intriguing question: ‘Do you think Pippa has the best boudjies in the business?’ Pippa, 31 next month and looking curvy in an £800 Matthew Williamson dress, is captured doing some 80s-style, finger-pointing moves to raucous music when the unidentified male comes into view on the dancefloor beside her.

Pippa was in the trendy resort with Mr Jackson, a grammar school educated stockbroker who has a home in Geneva. They were earlier pictured chatting happily and walking hand in hand around town and at the polo. The couple were recently reported to have been house-hunting in South London after Mr Jackson sold his £1.56million flat in Kensington.

A wanted man was captured by police on Friday evening after his attempts to exchange cocaine-coated currency at a bank's drive-up window resulted in employees contacting authorities. One teller at the San Luis Valley Federal Bank in Monte Vista, Colorado, complained of tingly and numb hands after handling the money of Joseph Michael Gutierrez, 24, of Del Norte, Colorado. The cash was also described as moist and having a strange odor.

Monte Vista Police Chief Jim Grayson told the Alamosa Valley Courier that officers from his department responded to a possible hazardous material call at the bank at approximately 5:42 p.m. on Friday. Once there, they found Gutierrez attempting to exchange numerous one-dollar bills for larger bills. The San Luis Valley Hazardous Materials unit soon responded to the scene, where field tests for hazardous materials were negative, but a sample of the bills did test positive for the presence of cocaine. On April 8 of this year, Gutierrez was summoned for driving with a revoked license, theft less than $100, and possession of drug paraphernalia. It has been reported that up to 90 per cent of bills in the United States carry traces of cocaine.","Joseph Michael Gutierrez was attempting to exchange dollar-bills for larger bills .

Then, after eight minutes of the second half, up popped Jack Cork. It was a decent time to score his first goal in more than 100 Southampton games; a decent time to remind Koeman of what he can offer, considering he has less than a year on his contract and Swansea are deliberating over a move. Until then, Southampton had been dire against. Thereafter, they cantered, Graziano Pelle rounding off the win in stoppage time. Heading home: Jack Cork gets up the highest to score the first goal in a poor Capital One Cup clash . Dire: Matthew Briggs carries the ball past James Ward-Prowse in a game that neither side looked eager to win .

Subs not used: K Davis, Gardos,  Taïder, Stephens. Manager: Ronald Koeman 6 . Referee: Dean Whitestone 6.5 . Att: 6,014 . MOM:Dusan Tadic . Koeman said: ‘There were two different halves. After the first 45, I was unhappy with the team. We didn’t control. They played fantastically, but we were very sloppy, not aggressive, not pressing. But much better in the second half. ‘The result is OK but I won’t forget the first 45. They (Millwall) gave everything and we didn’t in the first 45. That is not good.’ Credit to Millwall, they battled. Credit to Millwall, they were deceptive, considering all signs suggested this was a tie they could do without. Ian Holloway made nine changes to the side that lost to Rotherham in the Championship on Saturday, and in the stands, there were 4,000 less than at the weekend. Koeman, by contrasted, only drafted Matt Targett, Lloyd Isgrove and Shane Long into the team that drew with West Brom. Koeman added: ‘We know we can’t win the Premier League so we will see what we can win. For others, maybe they can’t always go with the best team because there are so many games, but we don’t have European football.’ Isgrove, used on the left on Southampton’s attack, is one of the latest bright talents to come through the club’s academy and looks likely to get more senior chances this season. At 21, he has already been included in the Wales squad and made his league debut for Southampton against Liverpool on the opening day. Celebration: Cork wheels away in delight after netting his first goal for Southampton at the Den . Here, he offered a single glimpse of what the fuss is about by rapidly pursuing Justin Hoyte and closing a 10-yard gap before scrapping for possession. But that was the extent of it. Midway through the first half he went down injured and after 29 minutes he came off. If that was worrying for Southampton, then so was the composition of the first half. They controlled large periods without creating chances, while Millwall twice came close. First, Jack Powell delivered a corner from the right which Byron Webster glanced across goal. Then, from David Forde’s punt, Magaye Gueye raced clear after 35 minutes. He sliced his shot horribly. Graziano Pelle attempted a lob from 40 yards for Southampton in response, but it was easily saved. It summed up the visitors’ half. Ecstacy: Graziano Pelle was clearly delighted with his late goal, which was thoroughly deserved . Holloway said: 'I feel absolutely gutted. I really enjoyed the first half. When I saw their team sheet I thought what have I done? I wanted to give people a chance, but I knew it was a risk. I am delighted with the way they did it but I am devastated.' The second started no better, Jermaine Easter going close after receiving a pass from Webster on the left. He cut inside and shot marginally wide from the edge of the area. Dusan Tadic, on for Isgrove, came close moments later as Southampton finally tested Forde, his shot from 20 yards drawing a good save. Tadic was again involved as Southampton broke through in the 53rd minute. His pass created a chance for Pelle, whose shot was tipped over. And then Tadic took the resultant corner, from which Cork headed the opener. The 10-minute blitz was completed by Pelle hitting the post. Thereafter, Pelle went close again with a drive from the edge of the box and then had a low strike well saved by Forde, while Millwall had a shout for a penalty rejected. Pelle deserved a goal and he got one, striking in stoppage time. Koeman looked pleased.","Cork scores first goal for the club to put Southampton ahead .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A 12-year-old girl who underwent life-saving gastric sleeve surgery after gaining more than 150lbs following brain tumor surgery has returned to school 50lbs lighter. Alexis Shapiro, who now enjoys activities including swimming again, told NBC News that she feels 'reborn' and grinned for pictures ahead of her first day back in a classroom in almost two years. But while she has shed 50lbs and reversed her diabetes, there are still struggles; she has a hormone condition that must be treated by a drug injection minutes after symptoms appear to avoid a coma. The pre-teen, from Cibolo, Texas was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor in 2011 and surgery to remove the mass disturbed her metabolism and left her body unable to regulate energy or appetite. Back to school: Alexis Shapiro, 12, smiles ahead of her first day of sixth grade on Monday. It comes five months after she underwent gastric surgery to curb her weight gain following a rare brain tumor . Still smiling: When asked how her first day back to schoolwent, Alexis gave a thumbs up and a thumbs down to show that it was fine, her Facebook page explained - but she was still smiling . Alexis, previously a happy and healthy girl of normal weight, gained 151lbs in the space of two years thanks to hypothalamic obesity. She developed type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related problems. Her parents Jenny and Ian, learned that their insurance did not cover bariatric surgery, so they set up an online crowdfunding campaign and raised more than $86,000 to cover medical costs. Alexis went under the knife on March 21. Due to complications, what should have been a gastric bypass had to be changed to a gastric sleeve surgery at the last minute. The sleeve gastrecomy saw her stomach permanently reduced to 25 per cent of its original size. According to her doctors, without the surgery Alexis would have continued putting on 2lbs a week and eventually become immobile despite a strict daily regimen comprised of diet and exercise. If her condition was left untreated, Alexis soon would have tipped the scales at whopping 400lbs. Before surgery: She put on more than 150lbs following surgery for the brain tumor. Her parents, Jenny and Ian, turned to the internet when their insurance refused to cover the gastric surgery for Alexis . Fighter: She is pictured ahead of the surgery in March. Since getting the gastric sleeve, she has lost 50 lbs . All smiles: Alexis is pictured before she was diagnosed with the life-changing rare brain tumor . But three months after the surgery, her mother revealed Alexis' type 2 diabetes was 'pretty much gone'. At 203lbs, Alexis was also suffering form an enlarged liver, but now the large organ is substantially smaller and her blood chemicals are at normal level. On Monday, when she returned to class, a school nurse stood by with a walkie-talkie and her emergency medicine in case her hormone condition sparked an 'adrenal crisis', NBC reported. The adrenal insufficiency is a side effect of the brain tumor and she also takes oral drugs to manage it. But when a crisis is on its way, she starts to get a headache, vomits and has low blood sugar. If symptoms were to show, she would need a dose of Solu-Cortef within 30 minutes. If she does not get it, her organs will begin shutting down, her mother said. Back in charge: Alexis is now swimming and playing like she did before and her mother says she has more confidence. She is pictured right in a swimsuit - which had been one of the little girl's aims . Jenny Shapiro said her daughter's return to school was both exciting and nerve-racking. 'It's... a huge step in the right direction, but it's just so hard to let go,' her mother Jenny told NBC. 'I'm her security blanket. I've always been with her so I've learned her symptoms.' But shesaid that not only is Alexis more physically capable, she is also returning to her happy, confident self. She recalled a recent conversation that 'melted my heart'. Her daughter told her: 'You know what? I used to see this fat little, chubby girl (in the reflection). I looked in the mirror and I saw somebody pretty. I like that girl.'","Alexis Shapiro was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor in 2011 and the treatment left her with a condition called hypothalamic obesity .

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . When Kate Bush gave birth to her only son Bertie, the child's existence was kept secret for more than five years until fellow singer Peter Gabriel inadvertently let it slip during an interview. Since then, the notoriously private musician has kept her son in the shadows, revealing little to fans and the media other than his name. Now, that seems set to change after 16-year-old Bertie, an aspiring musician in his own right, joined her on stage at the Hammersmith Apollo last night. Stepping out of the shadows: The mother of all comebacks was inspired by the son she once tried to hide from the world. Bertie McIntosh - the son Kate Bush had with her husband - sings, acts and dances in the show . Sporting a straw trilby from under which a halo of red curls could be seen, Bertie was one of five backing singers and has been, according to reports, working quietly with his mother for the last few years. 'He gave me the courage to push the button,' said Bush during last night's performance. 'Thank you Bertie. It's been a fantastic adventure so far. And it's only just begun.' So who is Bertie McIntosh? Born in 1998, his very existence was kept secret for years and he continues to live quietly with his mother and father David McIntosh in Berkshire. Known to be hugely supportive of his mother, he joined her at the Dorchester Hotel as she picked up a South Bank Arts award, watching proudly from the sidelines. But like his parents, music is his real passion and he has a track named after him on 2005 album Aerial and boasts singing credits on another track, Somewhere In Between. Still secretive: Kate Bush remains a private person and covered her face with her hands as she was driven away . Big moment: Kate Bush takes to the stage for the first time in 35 years - much to the excitement of fans . All change: Kate Bush in 1978 when she first burst onto the scene (left) and in a photo taken earlier this year . And his mother certainly appears to appreciate it. As well as his mention on stage, Bush also wrote glowingly of her son in the programme. 'Without my son Bertie, this would never . have happened,' she wrote. 'Without his encouragement and enthusiasm, particularly . in the early stages when I was very frightened to commit to pushing the ""go"" button, I'm sure I would have backed out. 'Throughout he has been my chief . consultant, my editor, my confidant. In order for him to be part of . this, which has always part of the deal, he has had to work really hard . in order to keep his school commitments as well as his commitments to . the show. 'He is a very talented actor and . beautiful singer, as you will witness and he brings something special to . the show through his presence. Thank you Bertie. Thank you so much.' As for Bertie himself, all he was prepared to say was to modestly note that he hopes his performances will allow him to 'earn his keep'. A chip off the old block if ever there was one.

In an emailed statement sent to MailOnline late Tuesday evening, Bussen said 'My [Marine] Corps unit was flying home after a two week long training exercise in Alabama.

The stewardess had been listening and suggested that the whole plane might like to hear as well. 'Going home had been on my mind all day, so when I got up to sing, that was the song that felt right!

"By . Martha Kelner for the Daily Mail . Sheffield United took what their fans may view as a small measure of revenge over West Ham last night. Victory at Upton Park came in a penalty shootout after the Hammers’ £12million signing Enner Valencia, the Ecuador World Cup striker, had his spot-kick saved on his home debut.

Referee: James Linington 6. *Player ratings by Martha Kelner at Upton Park . Upton Park was almost full for this second round tie, the first meeting between the clubs since they fell out spectacularly over a Carlos Tevez transfer. West Ham paid compensation in the region of £20m to Sheffield United after Tevez’s last-day winner away to champions Manchester United in 2006-07 effectively relegated the south Yorkshire club. But there were irregularities over Tevez’s signing and the club were aggrieved that West Ham were not punished more stringently. That money - and subsequent parachute payments for falling out of the Premier League - was not put to good use and Sheffield United are spending a fourth successive season in the third tier of English football. But Tuesday night’s result was sweet for them. Manager Nigel Clough said: ‘There’s still a little a bit of injustice felt by our fans but hopefully this was about how we played, and the win tonight.’ Both he and opposite number Sam Allardyce praised Blades goalkeeper Mark Howard, who made a series of superb saves to take the tie to penalties. ‘At the end of the day it is our fault,’ said Allardyce. ‘It was an Inspired performance by their goalkeeper. Whatever we shot at him he saved or blocked and if he saved, it fell to one of their boys.’ Only three players from that 2006-07 season - Mark Noble, James Collins and Carlton Cole - remain at Upton Park and only Noble was included in Tuesday night’s squad. But the passage of time and personnel has not served to stem the flow of bad feeling. Battle: West Ham's Mo Diame does his best to dispossess Sheffield United midfielder Ben Davies . Laces had barely been fastened before the first shouts of ‘There’s only one Carlos Tevez’ rang out from the home support. Around 900 visiting fans travelled and from their corner of the Sir Trevor Brooking Stand they responded with catty calls of ‘same old West Ham, always cheating’. Allardyce handed a season debut to the boundlessly talented but seemingly endlessly troubled Ravel Morrison, just two days before he is due to appear for a preliminary hearing at Manchester Crown Court. The 21-year-old has been charged with two counts of common assault. Morrison, wearing the trademark black gloves he dons whatever the weather, from high summer to midwinter, played his part in their goal. His pass out wide was collected by Reece Burke and whipped into the box to Diafra Sakho, who headed into the bottom corner. It was a debut goal for the Senegalese striker signed from Metz for £3.5m. Sheffield United were fortunate to equalise 12 minutes into the second half through a Winston Reid own goal. The West Ham captain was in the wrong place at the wrong time when Bob Harris’s cross was missed by Marc McNulty and deflected off Reid past Jaaskelainen.

The charges date back to the late 1970s and concern an alleged victim who was 11 years old at the time. Both men are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on July 29. The men were arrested last year under Operation Cayacos, a strand of a wider investigation which was launched following claims by MP Tom Watson. Another man, Richard Alston, 69, from Suffolk, is accused of five counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency with a child. Both men are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on July 29 . In 2012 Mr Watson used Parliamentary privilege to claim that a file of evidence used to convict Peter Righton of importing child pornography in 1992 contained 'clear intelligence' of a sex abuse gang.

"By . Ryan Gorman . A Doberman paralyzed months ago in a freak accident has learned to walk again. Kenny, believed to be 10-years-old, was unable to move his legs this past April after a metal door was dropped on his neck. Doctors initially advised the dog should be put down, but a team of volunteers had another idea. Kenny was sent to Two Hand Four Paws, a Los Angeles animal rehabilitation center. Now he is walking, running and playing like any other dog, a volunteer told Huffington Post. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . He enjoys long walks on the beach: Kenny once couldn't move his legs, now he runs and jumps in the sand . The poor pooch was left paralyzed after a worker at another shelter accidentally dropped the door on his neck, the prognosis for a full recovery was weak. The owner of the shelter brought the dog to Two Hands Four Paws, founder Leslie McMahon told the site, detailing his strenuous rehab. ‘I took him [Kenny] straight to the neurologist, and she knew we didn't have the roughly $8,000 to do an MRI and surgery,’ Ms McMahon recalled, ‘so she told us to just try rehab to see if we could get him up again.’ The dog was put through a rigorous physical therapy program spanning four hours each day.Activities included having Kenny ‘in the pool, doing massage, laser, acupuncture, assisted standing and assisted walking in the quad cart,’ she added. In the beginning: Kenny couldn't walk and had to rely on people carrying him, as well as the walking cart in the foreground . Poor pooch: Kenny was weak and unable to move any of his legs . Despite stiff limbs that made the process ‘incredibly difficult,’ the team plugged away, she said.Another hurdle encounter by the team was when Kenny lost the ability to pee. ‘[It] became life-threatening, and we actually thought we would lose him because of this,’ Ms McMahon said. Another group, the Bill Foundation, became aware of the dog’s dire condition and was able to cobble together donations totalling $6,000 in less than one day, the group’s director told Huffington Post. Kenny was sent for an MRI, and then went into surgery – during which doctors discovered the shocking extent of the damage to Kenny’s spine, and said he might not survive, let alone walk again. The Doberman’s battle still wasn’t over, as he contracted pneumonia less than a month later. ‘It was scary touch-and-go for a few days,’ but Kenny made it, Ms McMahon told Huffington Post. A lot of physical therapy: Many people worked tirelessly to keep Kenny's limbs strong while he recovered . A long road to recovery: The chances of recovery appeared bleak, but Kenny began to pull through . Baby steps: Kenny was able to walk with some assistance after a few weeks . Kenny’s rehab went into overdrive when he was finally healthy again. ‘At times we had four people in the pool with him, each one 'walking' a leg to mimic the motion of movement,’ she said. ‘He probably got at least 25 hours of physical therapy a week, including acupuncture.’ Ms McMahon reserved her optimism, but didn’t lose all hope. ‘I rarely see dogs walk again after being down that long. I frankly didn't think we would get this puppy up again,’ she told the site. Video Source YouTube . Playful pooch: The fully recovered doberman now runs, jumps and plays like any other dog . Write caption here . Good boy: Kenny sports a happy smile knowing that he's all better . Kenny rewarded the team’s tireless efforts when he took his first steps this past July.

"By . Australian Associated Press . Concerns are mounting over a powerful new form of gonorrhea after a patient was found to have the highest level of drug resistance to the disease ever reported in Australia. It is understood the patient, a tourist from central Europe, contracted the 'sex superbug' in Sydney and was eventually treated in Cairns. The discovery of the case in Australia, which resulted in a health alert in July, has also prompted warnings in New Zealand, where sexual health clinics are on high alert amid fears the new strain will spread there. A powerful new form of gonorrhea was found in a tourist from Central Europe traveling in Australia . NZ Sexual Health Society president Edward Coughlan warned the patient involved, who is believed to have left the country, had the highest level of gonorrhea drug resistance ever reported in Australia . Some men with gonorrhea may have no symptoms at all. However, men who do have symptoms, may have:    *A burning sensation when urinating;    *A white, yellow, or green discharge from the penis;    *Painful or swollen testicles Symptoms in women can include:    *Painful or burning sensation when urinating;    *Increased vaginal discharge;    *Vaginal bleeding between periods.Rectal infections may either cause no symptoms or cause symptoms in both men and women that may include:    *Discharge;    *Anal itching;    *Soreness;    *Bleeding;    *Painful bowel movements. NZ Sexual Health Society president Edward Coughlan warned the patient involved, who is believed to have left the country, had the highest level of gonorrhea drug resistance ever reported in Australia. The warning comes amid concern in recent years about an untreatable strain, known as H041, which was first discovered in 2009 after a sex worker fell victim to the superbug in Japan. There have also been reports of a medication-resilient strain of the sexually transmitted disease in Hawaii in May 2011, as well as in California and Norway. Dr Coughlan warned that most antibiotics developed in the past 70 years had been useless in treating the infection, and there were no new treatment options on the horizon. 'This is a major public health concern,' he said. Gonorrhea, colloquially known as the clap, is caused by Neisseria gonorrhea, a bacterium that can grow and multiply in the warm, moist areas of the reproductive tract, including the cervix, uterus and fallopian tubes in women and in the urethra in women and men. Symptoms are often silent but the long-term effects can be devastating, causing painful pelvic disease in women and infertility in both sexes. Comment has been sought from state and federal health authorities.","Powerful new strain of gonorrhea found in a tourist from Central Europe traveling in Australia .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . A middle-aged man has been taken to hospital after his friend used a firefighting plane to drop 400 gallons of water on him as part of the Ice Bucket Challenge. The 51-year-old, from Belgium, was taken to hospital over fears he may have suffered internal injuries during the stunt Empuriabrava aerodrome in Catalonia, Spain. But doctors have now confirmed he only received minor wounds and is recovering in Girona hospital. Scroll down for video . A 51-year-old Belgian man was taken to hospital in Spain after his friend used a firefighting plane (file pic) to drop 400 Gallons of water on him as part of an Ice Bucket Challenge . According to Rolf Kuratle, head of Skydive Empuriabrava which runs trips from the aerodrome, the victim had set the stunt up with a friend who had been flying the plane. He told The Local: 'They had arranged to do it as part of the Ice Bucket Challenge craze in order to raise money for ALS. 'The pilot flew a fire-fighting plane, the kind used to put out forest fires, and dumped the load onto his friend. They obviously miscalculated how much water it was.' Other Ice Bucket fails include one girl who was videoed running into a metal pole just after having freezing water dumped over her head, and another who fell off a horse after drenching herself while sitting on the animal's back. The accident happened at Empuriabrava aerodrome in Catalonia, Spain. Initial medics believed the middle-aged victim may have suffered internal injuries, but it turned out that he was not seriously hurt . Jesean Morris, 20, a fugitive from Omaha, Nebraska, was even arrested after posting an Ice Bucket video on his Facebook page which police used to trace his whereabouts. Morris was on parole following his release from the Omaha Correctional Center where he was serving time  for assault and use of a firearm during a crime when he posted the video. The Ice Bucket Challenge started in America but has since taken social media by storm, raising £37million for research into ALS, a degenerative condition also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.","Belgian man, 51, taken to hospital over fears he suffered internal injuries .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . Questions have been raised about whether USC's newly-named captain Josh Shaw sprained both of his ankles by jumping from a balcony to save his nephew, as he claimed. The cornerback, who has been sidelined indefinitely due to the injuries, said he had seen the seven-year-old struggling in a swimming pool at a family party in Palmdale, California on Saturday night so he jumped from the second story to save him from drowning. But on Tuesday afternoon, USC coach Steve Sarkisian said he has received calls questioning the validity of the story and the school is now vetting his account, the school website reported. 'I'm going to refrain from talking about the situation itself,' Sarkisian said on Tuesday. 'I will say that Josh had never given us any indication not to believe his story. He's been a kid of very high character for us, a team leader, elected team captain. I had no reason not to believe him.' Heroic: Josh Shaw, 22, was named USC's captain on Saturday - but he has now been sidelined indefinitely after claiming he suffered two sprained ankles saving his nephew from drowning in a swimming pool . But he added that they had received some calls questioning the story so the school wanted to be diligent by investigating further. 'Josh is adamant with what occurred, and we're going to continue to vet some of the stories that have come across our desk or our phones and see what we have and go from there,' he said. He added that Shaw has not changed his story since the questions emerged. The Palmdale Sheriff Station said that there was no record of a call regarding Shaw's incident. Shaw, who had been voted captain of the team just hours before the incident, previously told USC's website, that he had seen his nephew Carter, who can not swim, struggling in the pool. With no one else around, the 22-year-old athlete jumped off a second-story balcony and landed on  concrete below. Despite the pain in his ankles, the football player said he was able to crawl to the pool and pull his nephew, Carter, to safety before hoisting himself out of the water. He said that he was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with two high ankle sprains. Carter was traumatized but is physically fine. Shaw had been named captain of the team just hours before - but these injuries mean he will sidelined indefinitely, the website reported. 'I would do it again for whatever kid it was, it did not have to be my nephew,' Shaw said in the report. Strong: Shaw, left, defends against Notre Dame in November 2012. He started every game for the Trojans last season and was expected to start at cornerback this season . 'My ankles really hurt, but I am lucky to be surrounded by the best trainers and doctors in the world. I am taking my rehab one day at a time, and I hope to be back on the field as soon as possible.' Coach Sarkisian lauded his player's quick thinking when USC published the story. 'That was a heroic act by Josh, putting his personal safety aside, but that's the kind of person he is,' he said. 'It is unfortunate that he'll be sidelined for a while and we will miss his leadership and play, but I know he'll be working hard to get back on the field as soon as possible.' Shaw, who is from Palmdale, played at Florida as a freshman before transferring to USC. He started all 13 games for the Trojans last season and was expected to start at cornerback this season. Southern Cal is ranked No. 15 in the preseason by the Associated Press. The Trojans open the season on Saturday at home against Fresno State.","Josh Shaw, 22, was named team captain on Saturday - but he has now been sidelined indefinitely .

"By . Ray Massey . The number of deaths on the roads has risen alarmingly this year – with experts warning that the use of smartphones could be to blame. There were 380 road deaths in the first three months of 2014 – 13 per cent more than in the January to March period last year. But when the number killed is added the number seriously injured – to create the official Whitehall casualty measure – there were 5,500 incidents in the first quarter of this year, a rise of 17 per cent. Scroll down for video . Experts fear the rising number of deaths on UK roads could be down to mobile phone use and texting while driving. New figures reveal there were 380 road deaths in the first quarter of 2014 (file picture, posed by model) The casualty figures are higher among so-called ‘vulnerable’ road users on two wheels or on foot. Motoring groups said there were ‘questions to be answered’. Experts were last night asking whether issues such as mobile phone use and texting by drivers and pedestrians failing to look where they are going were contributory factors. They also said there were signs of increasing conflicts between cyclists and motorists sharing congested road space. The latest official estimates for January to March 2014 show that the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured rose by 16 per cent to 1,460. Cyclist fatalities and serious injuries increased 27 per cent to 690, while the number of motorcyclists killed or seriously injured rose by 20 per cent to 950. The figure for car occupants rose by 15 per cent to 2,160, while among children under 16 there was a 17 per cent to 500. The number of child pedestrians killed or seriously injured rose by 9 per cent to 350. Whitehall experts said the big rise could partly be explained by the severe weather at the start of 2013 which kept many vehicles, and pedestrians, off the roads. Motoring groups also said there were signs of increasing conflicts between cyclists and motorists sharing congested road space (file picture) March 2013 was the coldest March for 50 years which was reflected in the ‘comparatively low’ road casualty figures – including 336 deaths for the first three months of last year. They argued that a more meaningful comparison is the fatality figure for the first three months of 2012 which, at 414, is higher than the estimated figure for the same period this year. Also, the fatality figure for the first three months of 2011 was as high as 445. RAC technical director David Bizley said the weather had an impact, but added: ‘Mobile phone use has been a problem for some time and there’s not been enough action to tackle it. Using a hand-held phone or texting while driving must be made socially unacceptable.’ The AA’s Paul Watters said this year’s figures were ‘very disappointing’, adding: ‘We hope this is no more than a temporary blip to the long-term progress the UK is making in reducing road deaths and injuries.’ Transport minister Robert Goodwill said the number of deaths last year was the lowest since records began in 1926, but added: ‘However, one road death is one too many, which is why we continue to work to tackle dangerous driving and make our roads safer for everyone.’","380 road deaths in first three months of 2014 - 13 per cent more than in 2013 .

Ahead of the launch of the collection this September, luxury label Mulberry has released a film taking a look at Cara’s creative journey from the collection’s concept at Mulberry’s head office in London, to craft at The Rookery, Mulberry’s flagship factory in Somerset. For the collection, Cara visited the archives, choosing leathers, sketching ideas and discussing the practical needs she had for a multi-functional bag. The supermodel even used her famous tattoos as inspiration with the lion inking inspiring the studs on the bags and her 'made in England' design being printed onto the bottom of her arm candy. Tim Walker and Ronnie Cooke Newhouse chose the Scottish Highlands as the location for the campaign shoot for its dense beauty and intense landscapes. As well as fronting the A/W 2014 Mulberry campaign, Cara has even turned designer for the brand, helping to create her own collection . Animal-lover Cara loved filming on location in the Scottish Highlands surrounded by lambs and sheep . The Mulberry team and Cara apparently stayed in a Scottish lodge and woke up every day to early morning mists, huge breakfasts, homemade shortbread and wild land to the location for the shoot. Cara, who has made no secret of her love of animals, often seen carrying her pet rabbit Cecil with her, reportedly fell in love with one of the lambs that were roaming around the production team as they shot the campaign in an isolated spot. The fact that this project is one of many Cara has on the go at the moment is perhaps why she has chosen to slightly pare back her partying over the last two weeks. The model, who rarely stays in the same place more than a couple of nights, spoke about her hectic schedule to The Telegraph: ‘When people described things to me as a whirlwind, I never really knew what it meant, but then you get inside the tornado and you know exactly what it is. It’s madness. ‘You get so caught up in so many things that it can be difficult to find the time to say, “Am I actually okay with this? Am I happy?"".'

"By . Bianca London . Model, drummer, singer, actress, fashion designer and professional party girl - is there anything Cara Delevingne hasn't squeezed into her 21 years? The supermodel has added another string to her bow by turning seamstress in a new fashion video. Ahead of the launch of the Cara Delevingne Collection this September, luxury label Mulberry has released a film taking a look at Cara’s creative journey from the collection’s concept at Mulberry’s head office in London to craft at The Rookery, Mulberry’s flagship factory in Somerset. Many talents: A new video released by Mulberry shows Cara Delevingne designing her new handbag collection for the luxury brand - and she's a whizz on the sewing machine . The film documents Cara's project with Mulberry from the initial concept through to design amends and production. To garner inspiration for the collection, Cara visited the archives, choosing leathers, sketching ideas and discussing the practical needs she had for a multi-functional bag. The supermodel even uses her famous tattoos as inspiration with the lion inking inspiring the studs on the bags and her 'made in England' tattoo being printed onto the bottom of her arm candy. In discussion: The film documents Cara's project with Mulberry from the initial concept through to design amends and production . Testing, testing! Cara, 21, gives one of the satchels a good sniff at the Mulberry flagship factory in Somerset . Earlier . this week she said that young girls should aim for careers that are . more intellectually demanding than modelling but today, Cara Delevingne . stayed true to the career choice that rocketed her to fame by posing . in the new Mulberry campaign. The . 21-year-old, who made her TV acting debut in last night's Playhouse Presents . on Sky Arts tonight, proves in this new imagery why she became a . household name. Posing . in an array of fur coats and crisp white blouses, Cara shows off the . range she designed for the quintessentially British brand. Don't quit, Cara! Miss Delevingne, 21, showcases . her new handbag designs for Mulberry as she prepares to make her acting . debut on Sky Arts tomorrow after revealing that acting is her true . passion . Although Mulberry's new . bag is available in a limited edition lion design inspired by the . model's tattoo, there were also were plenty of other options on . offer. The hero piece is undoubtedly the beautiful . quilted nappa leather style, available in a range of colours, including black and green. Living up to her quirky reputation, the model said of her creations: 'My Granny will like this bag,' she revealed of the calfskin camo design. 'She’s 102 years old.' Bizarrely, she went on: 'My . five-year-old cousin will probably like this bag. He’s a boy.' Furry friends: Cara showcases her new designs . for the luxury British fashion house, including this camo napsack that . she says her male cousin would love . In little more than . two years, Cara has reached . supermodel status, . but in a . recent interview she seemed a tad downbeat about her chosen industry. While she acknowledges her ‘luck’ at having achieved so much in such a short space of time, she told Alexis Petridis of The Guardian that young girls should be aspiring for careers that are more intellectually demanding. When asked what she’d do if her daughter . wanted to become a model, she replied: ‘I’d say no, if that’s all she . aspired to. You know, I get a lot of girls who say, I just want to be a . model so badly. And I think: You can do better than that. Career change: The British supermodel is bagging . quite a few film roles. She stars opposite Kate Beckinsale and Daniel . Bruhl in the thriller The Face of an Angel, to be released later this . year, as well as playing a small part in Pan directed by Joe Wright . ‘I mean, look, I do love it, I’m not saying anything bad about it, I just think you can do a lot more.’ She . adds: ‘I was incredibly lucky to do as well as I’ve done, it’s not . easy, there’s so many models go through so much s**t, and it’s just, if . you have a brain, which everyone does, use it and try and do something . else.’ Today, she told The Metro: 'Acting is all I ever wanted to do so I'm living the dream. I prefer acting to modelling.' Cara’s ascent began in the offices of . fashion website Asos in 2012, where she was ‘discovered’ by Burberry’s . Christopher Bailey while working as an intern. ‘As . a model, I really stand for not being a model, if that makes sense,’ she said.  ‘When I started, the whole idea of the model was very . different, it was a bit stuck-up. Not stuck-up, but no one was trying to . have fun, or not even have fun, but be willing to smile.’ That . smile, allied with a series of comedic expressions, has become . something of a trademark - and a magnet for the cameras that follow her . every move. What's . more, the star admits she would love to quit modelling herself one day . and go away and make a music album for six months. She said: 'That's what I'd f**king love to do. And when this shit doesn't work out, yeah, I will block that out and do it.' Big break: Cara will make her acting debut tonight on Sky Atlantic's Playhouse Presents alongside Sylvia Simms . Success: Cara Delevingne's fortunes have changed . drastically over the last two years.

'She was the face, she was the icon.' Cara, who is known in the industry for her tomboy style, said of her shopping habits through the ages: 'I just used to wear superhero clothes.

"By . Dr Seth Shostak, The Conversation . While alien life can be seen nightly on television and in films, it has never been seen in space. Not so much as a microbe, dead or alive, let alone a wrinkle-faced Klingon. Despite this lack of protoplasmic presence, there are many researchers – sober, sceptical academics – who think that life beyond Earth is rampant. While alien life on planets has been shown by artists (such as in this illustration) it has never been seen in space. But there are many sober, sceptical academics who think that life beyond Earth is rampant . They suggest proof may come within a generation. These scientists support their sunny point of view with a few astronomical facts that were unknown a generation ago. In particular, and thanks largely to the success of Nasa's Kepler space telescope, we can now safely claim that the universe is stuffed with temperate worlds. In the past two decades, thousands of planets have been discovered around other stars. New ones are turning up at the rate of at least one a day. More impressive than the tally is their sheer abundance. It seems the majority of stars have planets, implying the existence of a trillion of these small bodies in the Milky Way galaxy alone. This is the proposed European Space Agency mission called Plato, which is comprised of small telescopes. Its jobs is to find all, or very nearly, of the transiting exoplanets around the sky's brightest stars . A deeper analysis of Kepler data suggests that as many as one in five stars could sport a special kind of planet, one that is the same size as Earth and with similar average temperatures. 40 billion worlds in our galaxy could host alien life, according to a recent study. And Nasa claims that we will be able to find that life within the next 20 years, with a high chance it will be outside our solar system. During a public talk last month in Washington, the space agency outlined a roadmap to search for life in the universe using a number of current and future telescopes. Do we believe there is life beyond Earth?' said former astronaut and Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. 'I would venture to say that most of my colleagues here today say it is improbable that in the limitless vastness of the universe we humans stand alone.' Such planets, styled as 'habitable', could be swathed by atmospheres and awash in liquid water. In other words, the Milky Way could be host to tens of billions of Earth's cousins. It is hard to accept that all these worlds are sterile, a circumstance that would make us, and all the flora and fauna of our planet, a miracle. Miracles have little status in science. Of course, just because there is a lot of attractive, cosmic real estate doesn't mean finding inhabitants would be easy. There are only three ways to do that, and they all depend on sophisticated and expensive experiments. First, we could find life nearby. There is real effort to do that, particularly in our reconnaissance of Mars. So far, most of the search has been indirect: deploying rovers whose job is to locate the best places to dig into the red planet, and possibly uncover either fossilised or extant microbes beneath the sterile surface. These are not attempts to find life. They are attempts to find places where life could be found. Progress is deliberate, and it is sluggish. Without doubt, Mars remains the favourite bet for biology. Nonetheless, some experts prefer to wager on the moons of Saturn and Jupiter. We could find alien life, but politicians don't have the will, according to Seti's Seth Shostak (pictured) At least five of these satellites seem to be home to some sloshy environments – mostly liquid water, although in the case of Titan, natural gas. Again, the type of life that could best thrive on these moons would be microscopic. Sensing its presence might be accomplished in several ways, ranging from simple flyby missions that nab effluvia from natural geysers, to sending elaborate drilling rigs to penetrate the ten miles of ice that separate the surface of Jupiter's moon Europa from the mammoth seas that lie below. Sadly much of this reconnaissance hardware is still on the drawing boards, not in space. Progress is slow, mostly because funding is low. A second scheme for sniffing out evidence of biology is to assay the atmospheres of planets around other stars. This is done using a time-honoured technique of astronomy, spectroscopy – an approach that would allow researchers to learn the composition of an atmosphere at many light-years' distance. While an experiment to find oxygen or methane in someone else's air is straightforward to describe, it is hard to do. That is because planets are dim, and the stars they orbit are bright. This . Nasa graphic shows how the number of confirmed planets has dramatically . increased since the launch of Kepler in 2009 and its subsequent studies . of distant stars . 40 billion worlds in our galaxy could host alien life, according to a recent study. And Nasa claims that we will be able to find that life within the next 20 years, with a high chance it will be outside our solar system . Various solutions to this problem have been imagined, including multi-element, orbiting telescopes and giant light blockers, or occulters, in space. It is rocket science, but it is not as hard as curing the common cold. Engineers could build this stuff within a dozen years, but only if they had the money. The third approach to finding biology beyond Earth is looking beyond microbes for intelligent life by eavesdropping on radio signals or flashing laser lights. More antennae and better receivers could speed up this search, but once again, funding is the limiting factor. President Barack Obama announced that the proposed 2015 Nasa budget has about $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion) for planetary science, astrophysics and continued work on the new James Webb space telescope . For perspective, consider that the proposed 2015 Nasa budget has about $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion) for planetary science, astrophysics and continued work on the new James Webb space telescope – categories that encompass all the planetary searches described above and more. That is considerably less than one-thousandth of the total US federal budget. The budgets for Seti, which takes the third approach, are a thousand times less. So it boils down to this: we don't know for certain that there is life in space, but the circumstances of the universe certainly suggest that this is a plausible idea. Finding it would be extraordinarily exciting, but because the payoff is uncertain, the investments in searching have been modest. Of course, if you don't ante up, you will never win the jackpot. And that is a question of will. Seth Shostak is a senior astronomer at Seti Institute in California.

"By . Martha Cliff for MailOnline . When it came to their granddaughter's 21st birthday one pair of grandparents weren't content with gifting a key in the door. Dee and Harry Giles made their granddaughter's dreams come true when they paid for her to get the boob job she had always wanted. Amy Hart, 22, from Worthing West Sussex had always suffered from low body confidence due to her 34A bust. Scroll down for video . Amy Hart turned to her grandparents for a loan when her mother couldn't afford her £5000 boob job . Although she was often compared to soap star Helen Flanagan, Amy still suffered from self esteem issues and hated being photographed in a bikini. So when it came to deciding on a 21st birthday present, breast implants were the obvious choice for Amy. However, when the air stewardess approached her mother with her request, Susanne Hart said that operation - costing £5000 - was out of the question. Desperate to get the breasts to match her size 8 figure, Amy turned to her grandparents. Amy says she had always felt really self-conscious wearing a bikini with her 34A breasts . Amy has now gone up four cup sizes to a 34DD and she says she has never felt more confident . Her doting relatives were hesitant at first but when Amy said that if they couldn't help she would take out a commercial loan Harry and Dee finally relented and agreed to lend her the cash. Once she was given the go ahead, Amy wasted no time and days later had booked an appointment with a private surgeon and decided on a double D pair to take the place of her natural boobs. The stewardess was no stranger to surgery having had her teeth corrected when she was just a teenager. 'When I was 17 I had veneers for my teeth and they made me so much more confident and willing to smile I figured that it would be a similar story with my boobs.' Since her operation Amy has felt confident enough to try her hand at beauty pageants . Despite it being a life long dream to have bigger breasts, Amy admits that she was nervous about the operation. 'I had a wobble the week before my surgery but when they came to draw on me I figured it was too late now and I was sure it was the right decision.' Since having the procedure the 22-year-old feels so confident that she has turned to beauty pageants to flaunt her new figure and has spent the last year strutting the catwalk. 'I'm loving getting in to the pageant circuit - I would never have had the confidence before I had the surgery' says Amy. Doting grandparents: When Amy (centre) first approached them Dee and Harry Giles  were hesitant to loan her the money, but when their granddaughter said she would turn to a commercial loan they gave in . 'The best bit is that it's not all about looking nice and pretty dresses - it's about inspiring younger girls and raising thousands for charity.' Amy says that since her operation she has been able to where whatever she wants without feeling self conscious about her small chest.

"By . Ap  Reporter . Southern California coastal areas filled sandbags and built sand berms Tuesday to ward against possible flooding from big and potentially damaging surf spawned by Hurricane Marie spinning off Mexico's Pacific coast. A large southerly swell was expected to produce large waves, rip currents and strong longshore currents in Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. 'These areas will potentially see the largest surf seen in recent years, with breakers of 10 to 15 feet possible,' a Weather Service advisory said. Scroll down for video . Breakers: Beachgoers watch large waves crash on the shore at Seal Beach, California on Tuesday as Southern California prepares for some of the biggest waves in years thanks to offshore Hurricane Marie . Making the most of it: A body surfer swims through a wave at Seal Beach in Southern California. A large southerly swell was expected to produce large waves, rip currents and strong longshore currents in Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Thursday . Taking precaustions: Residents in Southern California coastal areas filled sandbags and built sand berms Tuesday to ward against possible flooding from big and potentially damaging surf spawned by Hurricane Marie off Mexico's Pacific coast . Swimmers and surfers were urged to be aware of dangerous conditions, and minor coastal flooding and beach erosion is possible, forecasters said. In the city of Long Beach's Peninsula neighborhood, residents watched as bulldozers built huge sand berms between the ocean and their homes. Several took the warning to heart and shoveled sand into bags to place around their garage doors and entryways. Big Wednesday: Californians are preparing for some of the biggest waves in years on Wednesday, calling to mind the 1978 surfing classic starring Gary Busey, Big Wednesday . Deborah Popek, who's lived in the area 20 years, took a walk along the boardwalk with her cat, Sophie, to check the surf and see how neighbors were preparing. She's had flooding in the past, she said, especially in her garage. 'It's always at the last minute that everybody panics because, you know, we don't expect things to happen,' she said. 'But they're really taking things seriously because the sandbar is as high as they've ever built it right now. I've never seen it this high.' A few yards down the boardwalk, resident Corey Nelson shoveled sand into 10 sandbags with a friend's help. A firefighter had been to his home Monday with a warning and although the surf was quiet so far Tuesday, he chose to take it seriously. 'He said supposedly the waves come over the breakwater wall and there will be flooding,' he said, adding that the firefighter had talked about 10 to 15 foot waves at a breakwater that protects the Long Beach shoreline. 'We've had the water go over the breakwater right here and into our planter, and I mentioned that to him and he said, `Well expect that times three.'' The high surf advisory will be in place for several counties north and south of Los Angeles, including Orange County. But Los Angeles and Ventura counties will likely see the biggest storm surge, according to the NWS advisory. Swells generated by Category 2 Marie were expected to reach Southern California by Tuesday, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip currents, as well as minor coastal flooding, the hurricane center in Miami said. The U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami said Marie's maximum sustained winds decreased to 105 mph (165 kph). Additional weakening was forecast and the storm was expected to lose hurricane status in the next day or so. Marie was centered about 550 miles (880 kilometers) west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California and was moving northwest near 14 mph (22 kph). Swells provoked by the storm were affecting much of Mexico's Pacific coast and the Hurricane Center was warning of dangerous surf and rip current conditions. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 60 miles (95 kilometers) away from the storm's center, with tropical storm-force winds reaching out to 275 miles (445 kilometers). Wet: Residents shelter from heavy rain brought by hurricane Marie, in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco state, Mexico, on Sunday. Hurricane Marie intensified its activity throughout the day, reaching category five before eventually weakening once again as California prepared to face its impact later in the week . The southern Pacific coast state of Oaxaca requested federal disaster relief after about 10,000 homes were either damaged, flooded or cut off by mudslides on the state's mountainous rural roads due to rains associated with Marie last week. One man was injured in a mudslide but there were no reported deaths, the state government said late Sunday. The government of Baja California Sur, closer to the hurricane's current location, said it would cancel some classes in the resort cities of Los Cabos as a precautionary measure. Swells generated by Marie were expected to reach Southern California by Tuesday, and could cause life-threatening surf and rip currents, as well as minor coastal flooding, the hurricane center in Miami said.","National Weather Service says breakers of 10-15 could come Wednesday .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Jason Groves . Lib Dem MP David Ward was slammed last night for claiming he would copy Hamas terrorists and fire rockets at Israel if he lived in Gaza . Nick Clegg was facing an international backlash last night after a Liberal Democrat MP kept his job despite saying he would fire rockets at Israel if he lived in Gaza. David Ward tweeted on Tuesday night: ‘The big question is – if I lived in Gaza, would I fire a rocket? Probably, yes.’ Continuing his rant, he added: ‘Ich bin ein Palestinian – the West must make up its mind which side it is on.’ Amid a growing storm of controversy, Mr Ward issued a statement which Lib Dem HQ insisted amounted to a 'categorical apology'. He said: 'I utterly condemn the violence on both sides in Israel and Gaza. 'I condemn the actions of Hamas, and my comments were not in support of firing rockets into Israel. If they gave the opposite impression, I apologise.' He added: 'However, while I defend the right of Israel to exist and defend itself, I will continue to speak out for the rights of the Palestinian people who are facing untold suffering. More must be done by the world community to end this humanitarian crisis and protect the families living in Gaza. I can understand their plight and desperation. 'A ceasefire in this conflict is essential. If we are to end the suffering, and establish a safer society for people in Gaza, the first step must be an end to violence on both sides.' However, Mr Clegg has made no decision on whether to kick Mr Ward out of the party, despite him being carpeted last year for making comments seen as anti-Semitic. Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps insisted Mr Ward’s ‘appalling’ comment was ‘essentially an incitement to violence’. Former defence secretary Liam Fox declared: ‘Firing missiles against a civilian population is unforgivable at best, and a war crime at worst. 'That a party politician and member of Parliament should say something so irresponsible demonstrates why he and his party are unfit for office. This is now a question of ethics for the party leadership.’ Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi has written to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, urging him to investigate Mr Ward for encouragement of terrorism. Mr Zahawi wrote in the letter: 'Freedom of speech is an important right but it is not an unqualified one. This is especially true for public figures who have the capacity to influence the actions of others. 'Mr Ward's tweets would appear to be prima facie evidence that he has committed the offence of encouragement of terrorism as defined by Section 1(2) of the Terrorism Act 2006. 'Mr Ward may or may not have intended this statement to encourage others to fire rockets from Gaza into Israel, but regrettably he would appear to at least have been reckless as to whether others would be encouraged to commit such acts.' His comments came as militants in Gaza fire rockets into Israel as the region again erupts into conflict . Mr Ward’s comments were made late last night. Earlier in the day, he posted the message: ‘Sick of the mantra (that) 'Israel has the right to defend itself'. Palestinians have same right! Gaza rockets (are fired) because of failure in dealing with Israel.’ Mr Ward has a majority of just 365 in a constituency with a large Muslim population. Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, said: ‘It’s no surprise to see that David Ward would kill Israelis. And no surprise that he still has the Lib Dem whip.' And Charlotte Henry, a prominent Lib Dem activist and blogger, said his comments were ‘cowardly’, adding: ‘No human cannot be horrified by events in Israel and Gaza. David Ward debases them and shames his party.’ Labour simply described Mr Ward’s comments as ‘vile’. Mr Ward’s comments are reminiscent of those made by the former Lib Dem peer Jenny Tonge a decade ago. Baroness Tonge was forced to resign as the party’s children’s spokesman after saying of Palestinian suicide bombers: ‘If I had to live in that situation – and I say that advisedly – I might just consider becoming one myself.’ Conservative Grant Shapps (left) branded Mr Ward's comments 'appalling' and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg (right) launched an investigation which could see Mr Ward kicked out of the party . Mr Ward's apology was issues after after the Board of Deputies of British Jews called on Mr Clegg to withdraw the party whip from the MP, whose membership was suspended for a period following previous controversial remarks about Israel and the Jews. The Board of Deputies said he had 'shamed Parliament, the Liberal Democrats and himself'. Last year he was disciplined by Nick Clegg for ‘unacceptable’ comments in which he accused ‘the Jews’ of atrocities against Palestinians in a message posted just before Holocaust Memorial Day. He was suspended from the party for three months last summer following another outburst in which he appeared to question Israel’s right to exist.","David Ward, MP for Bradford East, claimed he would copy Hamas terrorists .

"By . Michael Zennie for MailOnline . The Federal Aviation Administration has effectively grounded Uber-style flight-sharing services that allowed passengers to hitch a ride with private pilots. A legal ruling by the FAA on Wednesday said pilots were generally not allowed to advertise available seats on their planes and accept payment for fuel costs unless they have commercial licenses. That premise - connecting private, small plane pilots with passengers - was the basis for AirPooler and several other online start-ups that were hoping to do for the skies what Air BnB and Uber have done for sharing apartments and hailing cabs. It seems now that the concept may have crashed before it even got a chance to get off the ground. AirPooler and other services allowed private pilots and passengers going to the same destination to connect and exchange payment for fuel and flight costs (stock image) AirPooler asked for legal advice from the FAA on whether its business model was permissible. FAA assistant counsel for international law Mark W. Bury responded: 'In your request for legal interpretation, you maintain that the AirPooler service is not a commercial operation and does not involve common carriage because there is no compensation for pilots. We disagree.' AirPooler maintains that the company satisfies a big demand for paring passengers who want to get away and pilots who are hoping to save some cash on their next flight. 'There’s a really deep underlying economic basis. It’s much more than a fad for the shared economy because you have all these assets around that are being underutilized,' AirPooler CEO Steve Lewis told Bloomberg. AirPooler operated as a 'car pooling for the skies' - like an Air BnB for planes - that allowed passengers and pilots to split the cost of a private plane flight . The 'sharing economy' has led to major success for companies like Uber and Air BnB. Uber, which lets users circumvent traditional taxi services by summoning private cabs from the smart phones, is worth an estimated $17billion. Air BnB, which allows people to rent out their apartments - or rooms in their homes - for short periods of time raised $500billion from investors in April. AirPooler and similar companies like FlyteNow say they will continue to negotiate with the FAA to find a way to operate within the rules. In the meantime, the flight sharing board has gone dry. There are currently no available flight sharing offers listed in major markets on AirPooler. The FAA ruling leaves one small glimmer of hope for the future of flight sharing. The regulator said that existing laws allow private pilots to receive payment for fuel and maintenance from passengers - as long as the fliers had already planned to travel to a specific destination. The rule had previously been exercised through world-of-mouth and offline ride boards, however, and the FAA said that AirPooler's system didn't operate within the narrow definition of the law.","FAA legal opinion came after AirPooler asked the agency to review its business model .

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . Injured: Natalie Eaton, 18, was impaled with a golf club on her second day of college, while attending a fraternity rush party at Arkansas State University . An 18-year-old was just two days into college when she was sent to the hospital in critical condition after getting impaled with a golf club at a fraternity party. Natalie Eaton of Harrisburg, Arkansas awoke on Thursday and was able to move most of her body, but she still doesn't remember the accident that sent her to St Bernard's Hospital in Memphis. According to authorities, Eaton was attending a rush party at Arkansas State University's Kappa Alpha fraternity, having a cookout and playing games around 6pm Tuesday evening. That's when a 19-year-old man threw a football at a 20-year-old man, and the 20-year-old hit it baseball-style with a golf club. But when the club made contact with the football, the shaft snapped and hurled at Eaton, impaling her in the neck. Doctors say the club hit a major artery and her spinal cord and initially told friends and family she may be paralyzed. But the immediate response of the man who caused the accident may have reduced that threat. 'His quick reactions probably saved her life,' Eaton's best friend Makaleigh Riddle told KAIT. The unnamed student held Eaton's head up for 15 minutes, applying pressure to the wound, until an ambulance showed up. Eaton was then taken to St Bernard's in critical condition. Scroll down for video . Scene: The incident happened around 6pm Tuesday evening at the Kappa Alpha house on campus.  The 20-year-old who accidentally impaled Eaton also helped keep her stable until ambulances arrived . It wasn't until Thursday afternoon that she finally woke up, and appeared to have recovered much more than expected. 'Where the club went in, it hit her spinal cord,' Riddle said. 'The way doctors talked about it, it was probably paralysis. That's the best that we were looking at. It was really hard to hear. But now she's moving her arms and legs a day later.' Rick Stripling, ASU's vice chancellor of student affairs, says he doesn't expect charges to be filed in the case since it was an accident. The fraternity has since reached out to Eaton and her family on Twitter, in apology and the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority held a prayer vigil for the new student. The incident happened just one day after classes started for Fall 2014.

"By . Associated Press . and Ashley Collman for MailOnline . The 6.0 magnitude earthquake that rocked northern California this weekend may not have been deadly but it was certainly disastrous to the historic buildings in downtown Napa. The capital of the state's wine country was littered with bricks Sunday morning after the earthquake caused  brick buildings to crumble, despite many being retrofitted to withstand the tremors. Experts say damage could exceed $1billion. Now locals are calling for an alert system to be put in place to warn them the next time a major earthquake hits - even if it's just a few seconds to duck and cover. Scroll down for video . The Alexandria Square Building in downtown Napa, California receiving arguably the most damage in the 6.0 magnitude earthquake that hit northern California early Sunday morning . Ten seconds before the severe earthquakecaused the ground to rumble throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, a university lab in the city of Berkeley got the alert that the seismic waves were rolling its way. The lab is testing a prototype of an earthquake early-warning system that California is pursuing years after places like Mexico and Japan already have them up and running. Sunday's rolling magnitude-6.0 earthquake near Napa has led to renewed calls for the system's quick deployment in the state before another, possibly more destructive temblor strikes. 'There's no doubt a major earthquake will hit California — the only questions are when and where. I believe an integrated earthquake early-warning system is essential to save lives and property,' California's senior senator, Democrat Dianne Feinstein, said in a statement Monday. She joined a chorus of political leaders and scientists calling for the system. Experts say it would allow trains to slow down or stop, power plants and factories to shut off valves, and schoolchildren to dive under desks to avoid falling objects, reducing injuries and damage. In California, it may be closer to reality than most state residents realize. A bill signed by Gov Jerry Brown last year ordered his Office of Emergency Services to develop a comprehensive statewide system and by 2016, identify sources of funding for it. It would cost an estimated $80million. Three people were seriously injured in the tremor, and nearly 90 hospitalized for more minor injuries. Above, bricks spilled out onto the street outside this building in downtown Napa after the earthquake . Locals are now calling on the state to set up an emergency alert system that would give about a 10 second warning before a quake . Richard Allen, director of the University of California, Berkeley, Seismological Lab, said the 10-second alert his lab received estimated the quake at a magnitude-5.7. Berkeley is about 40 miles from the quake's epicenter and did not experience any damage, but 10 seconds could have made a big difference in a more violent temblor, he said. That time would allow people to find safety, he said. Sunday's quake caused several injuries, left four mobile homes destroyed by gas-fed fires and damaged wineries, historic buildings and hotels in the Napa area. The damage has been estimated as high as $1 billion. The area has experienced dozens of aftershocks since, the largest of which was a magnitude-3.9 quake that struck at 5:33am Tuesday about 7 miles south of Napa. There were no calls reporting damage or injuries, but the quake did rattle already frayed nerves. The region suffered an estimated $1billion in damage from the earthquake. Above, the damage done to the Vinter's Collective wine-tasting room in downtown Napa . Twelve of the 15 historic buildings in downtown Napa had been retrofitted for an earthquake, but that didn't stop all of the damage . 'That's not just an aftershock. That's another earthquake to me,' Krisha Reed told KTVU-TV after running out of her apartment. She suffered injuries in Sunday's quake. The early-warning systems can't predict quakes and are not effective at the epicenter, where the tremors go out almost simultaneously. The warning people receive — a few seconds to tens of seconds — depends on the distance from the epicenter. Napa would have received, at most, a second of warning if California already had a system in place, said Thomas Heaton, a professor of engineering seismology at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Meanwhile, the city's business owners spent Monday mopping up high-end vintages that spilled from barrels and bottles and sweeping away broken glass in the rush to get the tourist hotspot back in shape for the summer's final holiday weekend. Napa Valley is known for it's world-famous wine production. Above, a store clerk looks at a pile of wine bottles that shook off the shelves at Van's Liquor's after the quake . A skater took advantage of a buckled street after a 6.1 magnitude earthquake hit the San Francisco Bay Area . Elvira Balbazar, an employee at the 3J's Oreintal Market cleans up after the earthquake . Government and tourism officials assessing its economic and structural impact encouraged visitors to keep flocking to the charming towns, tasting rooms, restaurants and spas that drive the Napa Valley economy. The worst damage and disruption was confined to the city's downtown, where a post office, library and a 141-room hotel were among more than 160 homes and buildings either deemed unsafe to occupy or enter. Two hotels and 12 wineries remained closed Monday, as well as gift shops, restaurants and other downtown businesses, said Clay Gregory, president of tourism organization Visit Napa Valley. 'Clearly, we are concerned that people are going to see that it was a catastrophe, and it certainly wasn't good, but it wasn't a catastrophe by any means,' Gregory said. August, September and October grape harvest represents the busiest time of year for both the valley's 500 or so vintners and the visitors who come from all over the world to see them work. At the famed Robert Mondavi Winery outside Napa, gift shop supervisor Kevin Seeman said there had been only a small number of canceled reservations. 'A lot of the staffers are worried,' Seeman said. 'Some of them, their homes are full of rubble; they are worried because they can't find their cats. The visitors seem not so worried about it all.'

"By . Martyn Halle . Transplant surgeons are using a pioneering technology that keeps a donor heart pumping outside the body. Dubbed the ‘heart in a box’, the device keeps the organ ‘alive’ from the moment it is removed until it is placed in a recipient. Traditionally, all donor organs are placed in a cool-box and surrounded by ice to prevent them deteriorating on their journey between hospitals. Not only does this extend how long a donor heart can be kept outside the body, but it allows specialists to assess if it is suitable for transplant. Saving lives: The Organ Care System (OCS), developed by TransMedics, allows donor hearts to continue functioning in a near-perfect state outside the body during transport . But over the past 12 months, surgeons at Harefield Hospital, Middlesex, have carried out 25 heart transplant operations in which the patient received an organ that had been transported and prepared for transplantation using the groundbreaking Organ Care System (OCS). It simulates the conditions of the human body, pumping oxygenated blood inside the heart so it can continue to function as it would inside a living person. The technology increases the time the organ can be maintained outside the body to at least eight hours, compared with a maximum of three to four hours on ice. This means hearts can be retrieved from further afield. Harefield began using the technology in February last year because of  the number of organs that surgeons were forced to decline due to distance. The hospital has since been  able to accept what are known as ‘marginal’ organs, which might usually have been deemed too risky for the recipient. Heart in a box: The device keeps the organ 'alive' from the moment it is removed from a donor's body until it is placed in the body of a recipient . The heart in a box also allows surgeons to assess whether the donor heart is suitable for transplantation. It is harder to assess a non-beating heart and mistakes can be made about suitability. The technology has already prevented patients from receiving a donor heart that will not work and could put their life at risk. Surgeons often start opening up a patient to receive a donor heart before the organ has arrived because of the limited time they have to get it into the recipient. Saving lives: The OCS increases the time an organ can be outside a body to at least eight hours . This is particularly relevant where . patients have been kept alive on an artificial heart, another type of . device that is ‘plumbed into’ the body, taking over the functions of the . organ. Because this . involves further surgery, more time is needed to get these patients . ready for transplant, so often a heart will be given to a person who can . be operated on faster. Between January 2010 and December 2013, there were 271 long-term devices implanted into adult patients across the UK. However, only  47 patients with these devices received a heart transplant in the same period. Since Harefield began using OCS, it has been able to operate on 17 artificial heart patients compared with just seven in the previous three years. Andre Simon, consultant surgeon and director of transplantation at the Royal Brompton and Harefield, said the heart in a box had enabled the hospital to carry out more transplants. ‘Put simply, it means that patients at Harefield have had life-saving heart transplants which otherwise would not have been possible, primarily because we have travelled greater distances to retrieve an organ and have been able to transplant  many more patients who already have an implanted device keeping them alive. ‘For us, the OCS technology has become the gold standard for organ retrieval. 'It means we can treat more patients and has resulted in patients spending less time on intensive care and in hospital post transplant compared with previous years. 'We have  also reduced the incidence of post-transplant heart failure.’","Organ Care System keeps heart 'alive' from donor to recipient .

"By . Gemma Champ . With their sweeping floor-length gowns and high necklines, the stars on the Emmy Awards’ red carpet appeared surprisingly demure. But only until they turned around ... for the most fashionable look this year was a blast of bare back. And it worked wonders for those who exhibited it, from Downton Abbey stars Michelle Dockery and Joanne Froggatt to big Hollywood names like Claire Danes. Scroll down for video . Maid for the red carpet: Joanne Froggatt (right) of Downton Abbey in a showstopper by J.Mendel and (left) looking every inch a lady is Downton's Michelle Dockery in Rosie Assoulin . It was the two Downton actresses who revealed the most daring amount of back at the awards ceremony. Both were wearing gowns that cut away from their shoulders, right down to the base of their spine. Their eye-catching expanse of bare skin saw both hailed as among the best-dressed stars, while Froggatt — modest Anna in the series — showed off an extremely toned physique. British TV presenter Cat Deeley went for a striking pink and white dress with a deep V of back cleavage, finished off with a bow. January Jones, known for her roles in X Men and Mad Men, wore a scarlet strapless dress that fell away at the back to show off her perfectly clear, smooth skin. All white on the night: Modern Family star Sofia Vergara in a strapless white Roberto Cavalli gown (left) and in the pink is British TV presenter Cat Deeley making her entrance at the 66th Annual Emmy Awards (right) And Ms Danes managed the night’s most demure back display in a stunning red dress with a lace panel. But while the stars may make this style look easy, flashing some back is surprisingly difficult to do well. For while breasts can be lifted, tummies tucked and legs improved by soaring stilettos, the back is far harder to artificially enhance. For mere mortals, there is the risk of love handles, back fat and even acne. Only exceptional skin will work, matched by perfectly honed arms. So little wonder that stars want to show off their smooth, tanned and perfectly toned backs when it is such a coveted asset. Most of them even put their hair up to give a clear view. Ladies in red: January Jones (left) wore a full-skirted Prabal Gurung gown, Claire Danes (centre) chose Givenchy, and Marchesa swathed Christina Hendrick's curves as all three dazzled in scarlet . But the trickiest part of the backless look is actually the front. For only those with a pert bust can get away with going bra-less — which is what these dresses demand. Ms Jones benefited from structure built into the bodice, which lifted her bust without the need for a bra. She and Ms Danes also worked the other major trend of the night: bright red. As did Christina Hendricks, whose voluptuous curves reminded fashionistas that a revealing front can be just as striking as any back. Julia Roberts chose to stand out from the crowd in a short bejewelled skirt. Her peplum jacket and skirt neatly demonstrated that, at 46, she has no need to hide her famous legs away.

"By . Fiona Macrae . A safe and widely-used arthritis drug stops Alzheimer’s in its tracks, a British study has found. The 20 men and women who were given Etanercept did not descend further into the disease – unlike those who were given a dummy treatment. Memory, mood and the ability to carry out vital everyday tasks such as washing and dressing were all, on average, stopped from getting worse. The results, revealed at a major Alzheimer’s conference and dubbed ‘quite amazing’, are comparable with those for Aricept, one of the few existing Alzheimer’s treatments. A home-screening test is available for to check for early Alzheimer's  symptoms . However, Aricept and other drugs do not work for everyone and their effects wear off relatively quickly. With Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affecting more than 800,000 Britons and the number predicted to double in a generation as the population ages, David Cameron has described dementia as ‘the key health challenge of this generation’. A drug already used for something else would be cheaper and quicker to test and get to patients. Dr Doug Brown, director of research and development at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘There is a desperate unmet need for new drugs for dementia but we know that getting treatments to market from scratch can cost billions and take decades. ‘Repurposing existing drugs could see new treatments for dementia available in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost, so it is an opportunity we can’t afford to waste.’ The study by Professor Clive Holmes, a psychiatrist and Alzheimer’s researcher, focuses on a blood protein called TNFα, which is key to the pain, inflammation and destruction of the joints in rheumatoid arthritis. It is also thought to trigger the death of brain cells in Alzheimer’s – and patients with more of it in their blood do worse than those with low levels. Etanercept, which is injected into the stomach or thigh, stops TNFα from causing damage. A safe and widely-used arthritis drug stops Alzheimer’s in its tracks (File photo) And given as a weekly jab for six months, it held Alzheimer’s at bay for that time, the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Copenhagen heard. Professor Holmes cautioned that only a small number of patients were treated – but described the results as ‘quite amazing’. He said: ‘Our results are better than we expected. ‘It is the first drug in a long time that has shown such promise.’ The professor is now seeking funding for a larger trial. Many promising Alzheimer’s drugs fail when tested on hundreds and thousands of people (PLEASE KEEP) but if the drug fulfils its early promise, it could be given to dementia patients in as little as five years. So far it has only been given to Alzheimer’s patients for six months. But it is hoped that given for longer, it would stall the disease for longer. It may even prevent someone with slight memory lapses ever going to suffer full-blown Alzheimer’s. Professor Holmes said: ‘We are not reversing the disease but we may be holding it back, so the earlier we start it the better.’ However, he stressed that much more research is needed. Dr Eric Karran, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, described the results as ‘encouraging’ but cautioned: ‘We know that clinical trials have a high failure rate and so we need to see Etanercept tested further in larger and longer trials in Alzheimer’s disease.’ The jab costs around £180 a week. However, it is hoped that by the time it is cleared for use in Alzheimer’s, the price will have fallen. It may also be available in pill form by then.","20 men and women given Etanercept found their symptoms did not worsen .

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . A newborn baby girl was listed in extremely critical condition Tuesday after her 24-year-old mother left her in a neighbor's trash can in Utah just three days after delivery. A woman heard what she thought was a kitten meowing in the trash bin in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns at around 7am Tuesday and discovered the newborn, Unified Police Detective Jared Richardson said. The child was airlifted to a hospital in Salt Lake City, where she is now on a ventilator and fighting for her life. Scroll down for video . Police walk near garbage cans where a baby was found Tuesday in Kearns, Utah, just three days after her birth . Neighbors heard the little girl's cries coming from this trash bin but at first mistook them for a kitten meowing . Her mother, who was being questioned by police, later returned and told officers she had left the baby about an hour before the child was found. Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder, who oversees the Unified Police Department, said authorities believe the baby girl was born Sunday. Winder said at a news conference that investigators did not have any information about where the mother gave birth or why she may have left the baby in the trash can. 'We had a young lady make a very, very terrible decision,' he said. On Tuesday evening, a woman who identified herself to Good4Utah as the young mother's sister came forward claiming that the 24-year-old did not know she was pregnant. 'She doesn't think like a 24-year-old,' the woman explained, adding that her sister has learning disabilities. Police would decide whether to arrest the mother after interviewing her, Winder said. The 24-year-old mother of one was taken to a hospital earlier today to receive medical attention and undergo a mental evaluation. Generally, anyone who abandons a child can face felony charges, in addition to any abuse or neglect charges, he said. There were no visible injuries to the child, who appears to have been suffering from a general lack of medical care. There is also no information about the newborn's father, Winder said. Bad mother: The child's 24-year-old mother is escorted from a home by a police officer after the discovery of her little girl, who was left fighting for her life due to lack of care . The mother's sister said the woman has learning disabilities and did not even know she was pregnant . At the news conference, Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams and health officials listed resources available for expectant and new mothers, including a crisis hotline and the state's safe haven law, which allows mothers to leave newborns at hospitals, no questions asked. A handful of infants are dropped off at Utah hospitals under the safe haven law every year, said Al Romeo with the Utah Department of Health. It's not common for a mother to abandon a child in a trash can or other unsafe place, but there have been a few cases over the past 10 years, he said. Romeo cited the discovery in April of seven dead newborn babies in the garage of a home in Pleasant Grove, Utah. Police believe the mother killed six of the infants after giving birth to them over a decade. A seventh baby is believed to have been stillborn.","Neighbors in Kearns, Utah, initially thought the baby's cries coming from their trash bin was a cat meowing .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan For The Daily Mail . A football team finds a level in the end. For this season, possibly beyond, Celtic’s level will be the Europa League. On this evidence, that may be no bad thing. Ronny Deila’s team crafted a useful 1-1 draw in the away game in Maribor. But the solid foundations of the first leg collapsed in catastrophic fashion 15 minutes from time. Make no mistake, there will be no UEFA reprieve from this. VIDEO Scroll down for Ronny Deila: We don't deserve Champions League football . Winner: Maribor's Tavares (centre) scores what proved to be the only goal of the game . Party time: Tavares (centre) celebrates scoring goal that sent the Slovenian side into the group stage . Here we go! The Maribor bench celebrate as the Slovenians stun the Scottish champions . Celtic: Gordon, Lustig (Boerrigter 71), Ambrose, van Dijk, Izaguirre, McGregor, Mulgrew, Johansen, Kayal (Commons 46), Berget (Matthews 66), Stokes. Subs Not Used: Zaluska, Biton, Denayer, Griffiths. Booked: Commons, van Dijk, Boerrigter. Maribor: Handanovic, Stojanovic, Rajcevic, Suler, Viler, Vrsic (Bohar 82), Mertelj, Filipovic, Ibraimi, Mendy, Tavares (Dervisevic 90). Subs Not Used: Cotman, Mejac, Sallalich, Zahovic, Arghus. Booked: Suler, Rajcevic, Stojanovic, Tavares. Goals: Tavares 75. Att: 58,000 . Ref: Viktor Kassai (Hungary) Galling is the knowledge that, at 0-0, Scotland’s champions were through. A scoreless draw would have been sufficient to secure a third successive season of Champions League group-stage football. But this is an under-resourced Celtic team with deep problems. The greatest of which is defending. Evidence Emilio Izaguirre, the fall guy of this debilitating defeat. The Honduran left-back was once the next big thing. With Beram Kayal, he was the shining light in Celtic’s fabled transfer system. Now he can do little right. He was guilty of the wretched piece of defending which allowed Maribor’s captain Marcos Tavares to hook a deflected shot home in a crowded penalty area in 75 minutes, a defensive header landing his own team bang in trouble. From the moment the ball nestled in the net, Celtic were effectively out. On a night of abject frustration and disjointed play, they rarely looked like scoring. In the third of four minutes of injury time they should, somehow, have salvaged extra-time when Virgil van Dijk — pushed up as an emergency centre-forward — blew a wonderful chance from eight yards. And yet, after two years of performing in the group stage and downsizing, Celtic’s chickens have come home to roost. Striker Stefan Scepovic will sign for £2.4million in the next 24 hours. But like Mubarak Wakaso and Aleksandar Tonev, the Serbian’s arrival is too little, too late. At time up, Maribor players and officials leapt and cavorted in disbelief on the pitch. They were an average team, but less average than Celtic. Both they and Celtic got what they deserved. So close: Celtic's Callum McGregor (left) watches as his effort finds the crossbar . Stunned: Celtic Kris Commons (left) and Virgil Van Dijk are dejected after the latter missed a late chance . Inevitably, there will be questions asked of Deila once more after this. His team were humiliated by Legia Warsaw, advancing on a technicality at the say-so of UEFA’s disciplinary committee. They weren’t good enough then and to exit the competition twice in one season is grim stuff. There was a naivety to the way he chased victory here. In the end the decision to sacrifice three points in Inverness on Saturday proved hopelessly misjudged. In truth, no one expected what transpired here. Maribor were dominated in Slovenia but turned the tables on a night when Deila’s side flailed and thrashed around. Celtic made only one change from the away leg, which finished 1-1, Efe Ambrose – in an eyebrow-raising move – replacing Jason Denayer in defence. Yet they played at times as if they had been introduced 20 minutes before kick-off. A degree of credit for that should go to Maribor. Passive at home, they were aggressive here, pressing higher up the field and more menacing in attack. For Celtic, it started promisingly enough. After five minutes Jo Inge Berget danced to the byeline and squeezed the ball across goal, defender Marko Suler slotting past his own post as Anthony Stokes lurked with intent. A large crowd, close to capacity, settled in anticipation of a home victory. Yet the passing of time brought unrest and concern rather than an opening goal. Maribor came close twice in the 16th minute. Agim Ibraimi found too much space in the middle of the pitch and smashed a 25-yard shot inches past Craig Gordon’s post. Tussle: Celtic's Virgil Van Dijk (right) tackles Jean-Philippe Mendy as the Hoops crash out . Talking to: The Maribor fans are spoken to by police at Celtic Park as their side . Angry: The fans clashed with police but they were left cheering as their side beat Celtic in Glasgow . Within moments, Stefan Johansen lost the ball in his own half, Tavares almost creating a clear chance until Ambrose got across to snuff out the danger. At right-back, there seemed less prospect of Ambrose — an erratic defender at the best of times — doing any real damage. And yet Maribor came closest of all in 33 minutes. A diagonal ball to Mitja Viler found Ambrose hopelessly out of position. As he charged across, the attacker cut inside to his right foot with ease and drove a low shot which Gordon brilliantly saved, the ball rebounding off the chest of Tavares and safely into the Scotland keeper’s hands. For Celtic, it was a let-off. Alarmingly, they were creating little or nothing at the other end. Callum McGregor was the liveliest player. Yet it was hardly a crowded field. Stokes was hopelessly isolated in attack and looks increasingly uncomfortable with the role Deila is asking him to play. Even so, the Irishman did craft a decent opening from a driven corner, van Dijk failing to find power or direction with his header. The concern of the home support was growing by half-time. Deila had repeatedly said he would rather his team lost than play bad football. There was a real danger here that they would exit the Champions League doing both. For that reason, perhaps, the Norwegian brought Kris Commons into the fray at half-time, withdrawing an ineffectual Kayal. Left out of the starting line-ups home and away, last season’s top scorer was a surprising omission. And yet this much was clearer. Stokes — and Celtic — needed help. And Deila was seeking it from a player he seems less than enamoured with. Not happy: Celtic fans protest after their side were knocked out of the Champions League . Fuming: Celtic have made a bad start to the season and must now play in the Europa League . The first thing Commons contributed was a yellow card. The second was a degree of urgency. With the crowd finally finding their voice, the home team gave them something to stir the senses when McGregor struck the bar from 10 yards after a fine run from Stokes. Celtic, suddenly, had a spring in their play. But few realised then that would be their best opening. With an away goal from the first game, they had no need to win. In that idealistic way of his, however, Deila was of no mind to take chances. It’s hardly hindsight to say his team were almost too open, frantic even. Commons came within inches of a spectacular opening goal in 65 minutes, collecting the ball 30 yards from goal. As it sat up, he had just one thought in mind, thumping a half volley inches over the bar. It was a fine effort. And yet, within seconds, Celtic survived a major let-off. For the first time in the game, Maribor slipped in behind the green and white defence, Dare Vrsic ignoring options inside to thump an angled shot straight at Gordon from 10 yards. The keeper pulled off a fine save, but for Celtic it was a significant escape. Their last of the night. Adam Matthews replaced Berget. Lustig then limped off to make way for Derk Boerrigter. When the Dutchman is the answer, it’s clear something, somewhere is malfunctioning. It all told in the end. With the scrambled, looping goal from Tavares. With the last ditch misery for van Dijk. With the disbelieving celebrations of the visitors. For Celtic, the Europa League is now their fate. Truth be told, it’s their level.","Celtic fail to make Champions League group stage .

Errol Douglas MBE, hair stylist to multiple A-list clients spanning film, fashion, music and business, shares a few tips on achieving that fabulous finish on a blow dry in between salon visits. PREPARATION IS CRUCIAL – ALL WASHES ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL . 'It’s really important to select the right shampoo and conditioner that begins the journey to the ultimate polished finish – a shampoo and conditioner that clean and hydrate without harshness or weighing hair down – it’s a crucial balance. Water temperature is also vital to get right – make it luke warm to cool. Hot water opens the scalp’s sebaceous glands which stimulates an unhelpful grease risk.' Errol Douglas MBE, hair stylist to multiple A-list clients spanning film, fashion, music and business, shares a few tips on achieving Kim's fabulous finish . EASY ON THE PRODUCT – LESS IS ABSOLUTELY MORE . 'This really is the most common blow dry blunder: overloading the hair with too much product. It’s true that damp hair is the first step in introducing something that assists styling, but when you select the right product you really do need very little of it. Before applying squeeze and pat dry with a towel, avoid rough drying. Also place the product in the centre of your hand and warm it before applying first at the roots through the middle and to the ends.' Errol recommends: Moroccanoil Treatment Light (for fine or blonde hair) – 'Apply a small amount from mid-length to ends. An extra tiny amount can be applied after blow drying to tame any fly-aways or condition dry ends even more.' DIRECTION? BACK TO FRONT – LITERALLY . 'Divide the hair into two sections, start atthe back and work your way forward. This technique contributes significantly to how long the blow dry lasts. If you’d like some movement in the end result, pin the section your not working on up, this gives that lift Kim has at the root that gives body but not bouffant.' TENSION IS A GOOD THING – FOR A BLOW DRY! 'Introducing tension and pressure at the root with a barrel brush with dryer nozzle pointed downwards to smooth the hair shaft as it goes gives the shine in the finish (equally a dryer than dries quickly helps here. The Errol Douglas Infrared dryer dries from the inside out so locks in moisture and helps minimise frizz and drying time). The super sleek end result is entirely down to firm pressure with the right brush as you blow dry. It creates root movement, and this very movement at the root is like the scaffolding of the blow dry you construct. Use a top quality anti-static round brush from the beginning until just before the polish stage.' Errol recommends: Morocconoil Luminous Hairspray – 'Those looking for extra volume can spray a little on the roots at this stage of the blow dry.' SWAP BRUSH & ADD SHINE – IT’S ALL IN THE FINISH . 'Change tools here as your prepare to really invest in a high shine,clean finish for your blow dry. Use a paddle brush to dry the remaining ends, and then comb through each section with straighteners. Spray hairspray up and in as opposed to directly onto the crown – it'll weigh it down.'","Kim, 25, carried handbag by Milli Millu .

"By . Andy Hampson . Stoke boss Mark Hughes hailed Mame Biram Diouf's stunning winner after his side claimed a shock victory at Manchester City. Diouf ran from deep inside his own half to nutmeg Joe Hart and hand the Potters 1-0 success over the Barclays Premier League champions at the Etihad Stadium. It was a brilliant first goal in Stoke colours for the former Manchester United forward, who was signed on a free transfer from Hannover in the summer. Winner: Diouf, a former Manchester United striker scored the winner for Stoke at the Etihad Stadium . Poised: The striker scored a fine solo goal to inflict Manchester City's first league defeat of the season . Bargain: The former Manchester United striker was a free transfer this summer from German club Hannover . Hughes said: 'We are really pleased for Mame. He is a striker and when you come to a new club you want to make an impression as quickly as possible and that means scoring goals. 'We could see he was going to give us something we didn't have last year, which was pace and power on the break. 'It was an outstanding goal and I hadn't realised until I saw it again how deep he picked the ball up. 'He kept on going and you always sensed he was going to go all the way and get a shot off. Thankfully there was enough power on it to beat Joe. It was fantastic goal to win any game.' Progress: Stoke manager Mark Hughes saw his side win after six successive league defeats at Man City . Diouf might also have had a penalty in the first half when he appeared to be tripped by Aleksandar Kolarov and he went close to a second when he almost connected with a Peter Odemwingie cross. Yaya Toure went closest for City when he hit the bar and the Ivorian also appealed for a penalty late on after a challenge by Erik Pieters, but he was instead booked for diving. Hughes said: 'Apparently people were saying it was a good call for a penalty. 'But I saw the one we should have had in the first half, which I felt was a good call. 'I am going to say they even themselves out. We scored a goal so we would have won anyway.' Big win: Mark Hughes hopes the win at reigning champions Manchester  City can kickstart Stoke's season . The victory was Stoke's first of the season and Hughes expects it to lift their campaign. He said: 'It was important. Either way, I always sensed this was a game that was going to kickstart our season.' Hughes, a former City boss, said the only personal satisfaction he took was in the importance of the victory for his side, as he had 'no axe to grind' with the Eastlands club. He added: 'I was here as the manager and enjoyed that time. It didn't last as long as I thought it could have done, but there you go. 'You just move on to the next challenge. I am at a good club now.' Dejected: Manchester City stars Samir Nasri and Sergio Aguero look frustrated as City failed to score . City manager Manuel Pellegrini felt his side, who had started their title defence with comfortable wins over Newcastle and Liverpool, were off-colour. The Chilean said: 'I think we were a very patient team, we tried to create space but Stoke defended very well, and we couldn't create space. 'I think (in terms of) the attitude of the players, we did all we could do but it was a bad day for the creative players. 'It was too easy (for them) the way they scored the goal in a counter-attack, from a corner in their own box and he ran 70 metres to score. 'In these games it is very important to be patient but it is more important not to concede. They defended always with 10 strong players behind the ball.' Pellegrini was frustrated about the late penalty incident involving Toure but did not want to make a big issue of it. Shock loss: Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini said it was a bad day for City's creative players . He said: 'What I think doesn't matter. I don't talk about the referee. All of you know it was a clear penalty. It doesn't matter. I don't want to analyse the game.' Pellegrini would not be drawn on reports linking City with a loan move for Monaco star striker Radamel Falcao before Monday's transfer deadline. He said: 'I am not talking about rumours. We have now 48 hours, we will see what happens. 'We have important restrictions about the amount of money we can spend and the number of players we can use, so it is not easy for us to bring important players.' Stoke were hopeful a knee injury suffered by Odemwingie was not serious while City midfielder Fernando was to have a groin problem assessed.","Mark Hughes previously managed Manchester City between 2008-2009 .

But Schneiderlin has started all three league games so far, and Koeman said on Saturday evening: 'I am very pleased with his attitude over the last few weeks. 'He accepts the situation the way it is. If he didn't accept it he wouldn't reach the level that he did today. Fine performance: The French midfielder curls in one of his two goals as Southampton beat West Ham 3-1 . Attitude: Koeman has praised Schneiderlin's attitude and application despite being linked with Tottenham . 'I understand his situation. If a player gets an offer from a big club I understand that but he is happy now and he accepts the situation - he is a fantastic player.' Despite former Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino being keen on taking Schneiderlin to join him at Tottenham, Koeman is almost certain the 24-year-old will remain a Southampton player when the transfer deadline closes on Monday night. 'If it is up to me it is 100 per cent. Ninety-nine per cent from the club that he will stay,' he said. 'It is always difficult when you have a lot of changes in the team and I have to wait until the start of September to know what players I have in the squad. But it gives us a good feeling after today.' Lesson: West Ham manager Sam Allardyce (left) said Southampton taught his side a lesson during the defeat . For West Ham, it was a disappointing afternoon, a week after a 3-1 victory at Crystal Palace. A penalty shoot-out defeat to Sheffield United saw them knocked out of the Capital One Cup at their first hurdle and Sam Allardyce's side were not at the races once again as they looked for back-to-back league wins. 'We weren't good enough,' Allardyce said. 'Southampton taught us a lesson, we weren't sharp enough and didn't retain the ball as well as they did, close down as well as they did and gifted them two goals. 'As much as they were in control and on top of the game, we've lost two very stupid goals from set-pieces.' New signing: Former Arsenal midfielder Alex Song has signed for West Ham on loan from Barcelona . One bright point for West Ham was the pre-match announcement that they have signed Barcelona midfielder Alex Song on loan. The former Arsenal man will spend the remainder of the campaign at Upton Park and Allardyce wants to see the Cameroon international 'kick a few backsides'. 'I hope he can bring a bit of leadership as well as his quality play,' Allardyce said. 'The lads are not opening their mouth enough. They all talk about what they should do before the game in the dressing room and in training, but when they go out on the pitch they don't talk to each other. It is clear that their communication is zero. 'Somebody has got to get a grip and open their mouth. If it is a short corner get someone out there. It is not difficult for someone to look around and organise the team. It doesn't appear that anyone is analysing what the situation is and not have the desperate defending that we had. 'Having spoken to him he looks a leader to me and kick a few backsides on the field. If they are not playing as well as they should do he will get them motivated.'","The midfielder scored twice during Southampton's 3-1 win at West Ham .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has admitted he was envious of watching other clubs compete in the Champions League in the last few years. The Reds are back in Europe's premier club competition, following their runners-up finish in the Barclays Premier League last season, for the first time since the 2009/10 campaign. Gerrard, who inspired Liverpool to glory in the competition in 2005, is understandably champing at the bit to once again compete against the best players the continent has to offer. VIDEO Scroll down for Steven Gerrard gets a shock taking on the Ice Bucket Challenge . Crowning glory: Steven Gerrard lifts the Champions League trophy for Liverpool in 2005 . Talking point: Gerrard listens to Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers during a training session on Friday . And he has revealed missing the last few editions, as Liverpool went though a difficult period, had been a wrench. 'I've missed it so much. There's almost a jealousy when you watch the Champions League and you're not involved in it,' the 34-year-old told Liverpool's official website. 'It's a horrible thing to do - you want to be part of it. It's the ultimate competition. I'm just as excited as any supporter and anyone connected to the club. I can't wait for it to start.' The five-time winners have been drawn in a group with defending champions Real Madrid along with Swiss side Basle and Bulgarian outfit Ludogorets. Gerrard acknowledges they face stern opposition, and not just from the Spanish giants, but is optimistic they can reach the knockout stages. Feeling Blue: Gerrard admits it has been tough watching Premier League rivals, such as Chelsea, in Europe . Consistent: Arsenal have been an ever-present in the Champions League under Arsene Wenger . Missing out: Manchester United will not be in Europe's top competition after last season's poor campaign . 'It's a tough group and there are some tough games in there, but it's an exciting group and certainly a group that we can progress from. That's the key. The first challenge is to get out of the group,' he said. Gerrard is, however, relishing the double-header with Carlo Ancelotti's Real. He added: 'They were one of the sides that all of the players wanted, and certainly the supporters. The supporters can't wait to get over to Madrid and have a good time. 'For us, it's a chance to go and compete against the best. We're not in this competition to make the numbers up; we're not celebrating and going out to enjoy this competition - we want to compete and go as far as we can.'","Liverpool are back in Europe's premier club competition for the first time since the 2009/10 campaign .

"By . David Clough, Press Association . England have named uncapped batsman Jason Roy in their 14-man squad for the one-off NatWest Twenty20 International against India at Edgbaston. Roy, 24, gets the call after a breakthrough season at Surrey, for whom he is the country's top NatWest Twenty20 Blast run-scorer with 677 at an average of 48.35 and strike rate of almost 160. The Durban-born batsman is joined in the squad to face India next weekend by three other players not currently involved in the Royal London one-day international series. Hitting out: Jason Roy has been in superb form for Surrey during this year's Natwest T20 blast . Eoin Morgan (captain), Moeen Ali, Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Jos Buttler (wkt), Steven Finn, Harry Gurney, Aalex Hales, Chris Jordan, Joe Root, Jason Roy , James Taylor, James Tredwell, Chris Woakes. They are Ravi Bopara, a surprise omission from the ODI squad, seamer Tim Bresnan and Nottinghamshire batsman James Taylor. Eoin Morgan is again captain, as he was for England's Twenty20 against Sri Lanka earlier this summer, in the injury-enforced absence of Stuart Broad - who is set to undergo surgery on his knee this week. Michael Carberry and Ian Bell, both involved in the defeat against Sri Lanka at The Oval in May, have made way for Roy and Taylor. The latter has not featured for his country since last September's ODI win over Ireland in Dublin but has had a fine season for Nottinghamshire, while former dual Ashes winner Bresnan last played in England's embarrassing ICC World Twenty20 defeat against Holland in Chittagong five months ago. National selector James Whitaker said: 'This one-off NatWest International Twenty20 provides us with an opportunity to look at players who have impressed recently in domestic cricket and gives them a chance to test themselves on the international stage against high-quality opposition.' Taylor's availability depends on the conclusion next Saturday, without need for a reserve day, of Notts Outlaws' Royal London Cup semi-final against Durham at Chester-le-Street. Dynamic: The opener blasted 677 runs in the competition, earning him a first call-up to the England squad . Adopted nation: Roy was born in South Africa . Before then, England have more pressing issues to address after their second successive ODI trouncing by India at Trent Bridge on Saturday. The six-wicket setback, inflicted with seven overs to spare after England again failed to cope with the travelling spinners, leaves the hosts 2-0 down and unable therefore to win the five-match series after an initial washout in Bristol. Captain Alastair Cook has been under pressure already from those, including former team-mates Graeme Swann and Michael Vaughan in their post-retirement roles as pundits, who believe he is not the right man to lead England to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand early next year. While Roy, Taylor and Bopara will have the opportunity next Sunday to demonstrate they can provide fresh impetus in England's middle order and therefore even steal into the World Cup, Cook cannot stargaze about what may happen next February and March but must concentrate on putting things right in this week's two remaining ODIs at Edgbaston and Headingley. 'When you play for England, you're under pressure to perform,' Cook said. 'You keep looking six months, seven months away ... (but) we're very clear in the dressing room that we're trying to win the next game. Return: James Taylor's excellent limited overs form has earned him a place back in the England reckoning . 'You can turn it around very quickly, but it starts with individual responsibility.' Cook himself has gone 37 ODI innings, and more than two years, without a century - and collectively, England have made just four hundreds against Test opposition in 26 matches on their way to defeat in four of their last five series since the start of last summer. The captain knows that must change, and is optimistic it will. 'It will take someone to score that hundred, and everyone will jump on the back of that,' Cook said. 'You get 330 and you win a game of cricket, and it changes. 'It would (just) take someone like 'Morgs', for example, to suddenly go bang bang and get some 80s. He's that type of player. Firepower: Ravi Bopara's big hitting, clever shotmaking and canny bowling is useful in T20 cricket . 'But again, probably it's confidence as a batting unit that we haven't scored the runs in the last couple of games. 'The only way (to put it right) is not looking at anyone else, but the six or seven batters to turn it round themselves.' There was minor encouragement for England in the return at Trent Bridge of fast bowler Steven Finn, so badly out of form last winter and absent from international cricket for almost a year. Finn has also been selected in the Twenty20 squad, and Cook senses he is on his way back to peak form. 'He's come such a long way from where he was in February,' Cook said. 'He probably went for a few too many runs [at Nottingham] - but as a guy bowling at 86, 87mph on a slow wicket, he adds a different dimension. 'You saw the best of Finn in New Zealand, and India once when we were there. 'If he can get back to that level, he's a very fine bowler.'","South African-born batsman handed first England chance .

Mario Balotelli's £16million move to Liverpool will be made official in the next 48 hours as his agent warned that this is the player’s last chance to star at an elite club. The Italy forward flew to the UK on Friday evening to begin his medical and met Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers at the club’s Melwood training ground, where hundreds of supporters had gathered to welcome him. Balotelli completed the second part of his medical on Saturday before returning to Milan and it is now a question of when Liverpool announce he has become their ninth - and most unexpected - signing of the summer.

The 31-year-old wed Krista D'Agostino in a ceremony and reception donated by local business. In front of some 150 family and friends at Boston's Hyatt Regency, the couple said 'I do.' Happy day: For a while, standing at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in 2013 was the worst thing that happened to survivor James Costello, pictured, but it quickly became the best . The location was donated, as were services including wedding planning, video and cocktails, according to the New York Daily News. The beautiful photography of the event was donated by Prudente Photography. The couple became close as Costello struggled through months of surgery and painful rehabilitation following the April 2013 bombing. Though he didn't lose a limb like many others, he was left with painful wounds throughout his body. A now-iconic image shows Costello staggering down Boylston Street in the aftermath of the blast with his clothes in tatters. Vows: Costello was blown up in the terrifying attack but the resulting agony saw him meet the love of his life, the nurse who cared for him in hospital, and the couple tied the knot this past weekend . Joy: Costello previously said he was so happy he'd been blown up because he got to meet D'Agostino . Loving: D'Agostino, a nurse at the Spaulding Rehabilition Hospital, nursed Costello through his operations . The bombing left three dead and more than 260 injured. D'Agostino, who worked at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, nursed him through grueling skin graft operations and exhaustive physical therapy. 'She hates when I say this, but I'm actually glad I got blown up ...I got her,' the survivor said on the 'Today' show in December. Hyatt's marketing director Emily Sharp described the ceremony as 'amazing,' to the Daily News. 'They're the nicest, most deserving people.' The newlyweds are now heading to Hawaii for a relaxing honeymoon. The nuptials come a few months after another Boston bombing survivor - Costello's friend Marc Fucarile who lost his right leg - wed his high school sweetheart, and achieved his goal of walking down the aisle. Aftermath: This now-iconic image shows Costello staggering down Boylston Street in the aftermath of the blast with his clothes in tatters. He was at the event with a group of school friends who were also injured . Fucarile and his fiancée Jen Regan tied the knot at Fenway Park in April, a year after the roofer lost his right leg, broke his left, suffered severe burns and was peppered with shrapnel. The 35-year-old, who was the last bombing victim to leave hospital after undergoing a staggering 49 surgical procedures, had wanted to reclaim the week and create happy memories. He grinned as he left the stadium, using a cane to help him walk on his new prosthetic and the support of his new wife's hand. The couple, who have a six-year-old son, enjoyed a day themed with the colors of 'Boston Strong' - blue and yellow - from bridesmaid dresses to the Duck Tour buses used to ferry guests. Fucarile, who had been planning his wedding when the bombs exploded and put the plans on hold, added that he knew right away that Fenway was the perfect venue for the wedding. Stunning: The couple were married in front of 150 friends and loved ones at Boston's Hyatt Regency .

'We were going to get married on an island, a beach or Fenway Park,' Fucarile told Boston.com. 'Once we found out [the reception] would be at the Hotel Commonwealth, I told Jen, ""We're getting married at Fenway Park somehow"".' Fucarile was watching a friend take part in the marathon with four boyhood buddies from Stoneham, Massachusetts when the bombs went off. After the first bomb detonated, brothers Paul and J.P. Norden huddled with Jarrod Clowery, James 'Bim' Costello and Fucarale, not realizing they were inches away from the second device. When it exploded, both brothers and Fucarile lost a leg, while Clowery suffered burns and shrapnel wounds and Costello was hospitalized with serious injuries.","James Costello was blown up in the April 2013 attack but the resulting agony saw him meet the love of his life, the nurse who cared for him .

"By . Nick Purewal . Neil Warnock has admitted Crystal Palace will face a transfer-deadline frenzy after he put recruitment plans on hold for Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Newcastle. The new Eagles boss secured Wilfried Zaha's Selhurst Park return on Thursday on a season-long loan deal from Manchester United. Warnock set Friday aside for team preparations, leaving just Sunday and Monday for Palace to complete as many as four more deals. Scroll down for videos... Keep calm and carry on: New Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock is biding his time in the transfer market . Guess who's back! Wilfried Zaha returns to Selhurst Park on loan from Manchester United . The transfer window shuts at 11pm on Monday, with Palace still keen on Southampton's Jack Cork and Norwich's Gary Hooper. 'I have had 320 messages from agents and they are all brilliant players, all with different agents,' said Warnock, who cut off his Cornwall retirement to return to the south London club. 'I doubt we can do anything before the weekend. 'We need to get through the weekend. If we can get three or four players, I think we can hold our own. 'Hopefully by Sunday, Monday night we will have a couple of people to show you. I'm sure it will be chaos, it always is.' Club in turmoil: Crystal Palace have lost both of their opening Premier League games this season . Tony Pulis quit Palace on the eve of the new league season after rowing with owner Steve Parish over transfer strategy. Warnock revealed he did not even discuss recruitment or transfer funds with co-chairman Parish before agreeing to take the Selhurst Park helm. 'You don't talk about anything like that,' he said. 'I didn't talk about money or anything, it was the opportunity. 'I think contracts came later. You don't get opportunities like this very often. 'Probably in different circumstances, there might have been four or five other managers who might have enjoyed it as well. But I'm very fortunate I have the job now.

"By . Chris Waugh . Nothing will give Arsenal fans more pleasure than knowing that one of their own helped humiliate Manchester United on Tuesday night as MK Dons hammered Louis van Gaal's side 4-0. Benik Afobe is the second Gunners striker this year to down a United side while on loan at another club after Joel Campbell netted against the Reds for Olympiacos in a 2-0 win for the Greek side. But, with Olivier Giroud struggling with a foot injury and Arsenal struggling for options up front, Gunners fans will be left wondering why Arsene Wenger cannot select Afobe in the first-team right now. VIDEO Scroll down for Jack Wilshere's thoughts on Benik Afobe and other Arsenal youth . Brace: Arsenal loanee Benik Afobe netted twice for MK Dons during their 4-0 victory over Manchester United . Celebration: Afobe showed his pace, power and strength during the Capital One Cup tie on Tuesday evening . Afobe - a 21-year-old striker who is enjoying his sixth loan spell in four years - bagged a brace for the Dons to wrap up a famous win for the League One side. The forward now has three goals in six games this season. He showed his pace, power and strength as he tormented United's young defence and opportunistically capitalised on two mistakes to score twice. For the first goal, Afobe ran in behind the United defence and took a wonderful through-ball in his stride before coolly slotting past David de Gea. His second strike was perhaps even more impressive. After James Reece misjudged a long ball down the right-hand side, Afobe ran in behind him, nicked the ball and held off the challenges of three players as he advanced into the box and fired home. Cool: Afobe slots home his first, and MK Dons' third, after collecting an excellent through-ball . Opportunism: Afobe nicks in behind the United defence before beating three defenders to score his second . Born in Kent, Afobe was picked up by Arsenal's academy at the age of just six. He was signed professionally in 2010 and has since spent time on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, Huddersfield Town, Reading, Bolton and Millwall. His career return of 15 goals in 71 games is not overly impressive, but the potential he showed against United means Wenger must be contemplating why he allowed to let him leave on a season-long loan. Having represented England from U16 through to U21 level - and having scored once already for the oldest of those sides - he has shown he can rise to the big occasion. But even if Arsenal fans do not see Afobe play at the Emirates for the remainder of this season, they will laud him as a hero after downing United in such devastating fashion. Finish: Afobe raced into the box, beating three men on the way, before unleashing an unstoppable shot .

He came back as a World Cup winner. He got back (to Arsenal) on August 11 and he has already played two games, so after three or four weeks he will be at his best again.’ Ozil, 25, was bought from Real Madrid for £42.5million a year ago, making him the most expensive export in German football history and Arsenal’s biggest ever signing. Glory: Ozil won the World Cup with Germany in Brazil during the summer and only returned on August 11 . Prospect: Ozil was a rising star in La Liga with Madrid before the £42.5m deal which brought him to Arsenal . But his languid style has given rise to accusations of laziness, even in his homeland where former Germany star Paul Breitner called for him to be dropped before the World Cup semi-final against Brazil because he ‘does nothing but walk around the pitch’. There have been calls for Wenger to bolster his squad in the final days of the transfer window, particularly up front where injured Olivier Giroud will be unavailable until at least January. While he said he would ‘remain alert’ until the final seconds of the window, Wenger believes his squad is strong enough without more additions. He also claimed bringing in too many players can deny youngsters a chance to break through. ‘If you always buy, you can never give a chance to a player,’ he said. ‘Take the example of Calum Chambers. Calum played centre back because I gave him the chance. If I had bought four centre backs already I would never have played him.’ High five!

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . Sportsmail's Lawrence Booth pinpoints the main statistics and talking points surrounding James Anderson's pursuit of a record ahead of the fifth Test between England and India at the Kia Oval. Chasing Botham . Jimmy Anderson needs seven wickets to equal the England Test record of 383 held by Ian Botham. Anderson sits joint-15th on the overall list. Chase: Jimmy Anderson needs seven wickets to equal the England Test record of 383 held by Sir Ian Botham . Indian feast . In terms of wickets taken, India are Anderson’s favourite opponents, providing him with 78 of his Test scalps at 27.46 apiece. On average, his richest pickings have come against Pakistan: 32 wickets at 17.65. The early bird... Anderson's ability to swing the ball both ways, late and at pace, makes it tough for batsmen early on. He has inflicted 52 ducks on Test batsmen (India’s Virender Sehwag, with three, is top) and 125 have failed to reach double figures. Thanks for coming, lads! India are Anderson's (left) favourite opponents in Test match cricket . Rabbits in the headlights . His all-time bunny is Australia seamer Peter Siddle, who has fallen 11 times to Anderson in Tests, but some big names are close behind. Anderson has removed Michael Clarke and Sachin Tendulkar nine times, with Shane Watson on eight. Heartbeat of the team . Anderson has been a reliable barometer of England’s health. He has played in 44 Test wins, in which he has claimed an impressive 207 wickets at 22.63 apiece. But in 29 defeats, his figures are considerably worse: 74 wickets at 46.09 each. All smiles: Botham shares a joke with Anderson in 2013, but the latter is closing in on his record . Golden year . The most wickets Anderson has claimed in a calendar year was the 57 he managed in 2010. But his best yearly average so far belongs to 2014, when his 36 Test wickets have cost just 22.75 apiece. James' giant haul . In all, Anderson has bowled to 252 Test batsmen and has dismissed 167 of them. Of his haul of 376 wickets, 247 have been caught, 81 bowled and 48 lbw; 255 of those have been right-handers, with 121 being lefties.

"By . Paul Newman for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Alastair Cook could never have imagined what was ahead of him when he lifted the Ashes urn at The Kia Oval this time last year, but the England captain now has the opportunity to consign 12 months of near total misery to history. A win for Cook’s ‘new’ side in the final Investec Test would not only complete a series victory over India but would draw a line under the recriminations which accompanied the unravelling of one of the most successful of all England teams. The famous old south London ground is a worthy venue for Cook, the highest profile survivor of the Australia whitewash fall-out, to attempt to silence any remaining doubts that he truly is the best man to take England forward. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Captain Cook focused on series win . Year's a long time! Alastair Cook and England were lifting the Ashes at the Oval in August 2013 . Look what's happened since: Australia reclaimed the little urn with ease Down Under last winter . ENGLAND (probable): Cook (capt), Robson, Ballance, Bell, Root, Moeen, Buttler (wkt), Woakes, Jordan, Broad, Anderson. INDIA (probable): Vijay, Gambhir, Pujara, Kohli, Rahane, Dhoni (capt/wkt), Jadeja, Ashwin, Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Aaron. Umpires: Kumar Dharmasena (SL) and Paul Reiffel (Aus). TV umpire: Tim Robinson (Eng). Match referee: Ranjan Madugalle (SL). Pitch: Looked a bit greener than usual yesterday and England hope it has more pace and carry than last year. TV and Radio: LIVE on Sky Sports 2 from 10am and on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra from 10.25am. Weather: South London looks set to be dry, but possibly cloudy, for the bulk of the Test. Not only has Cook twice been part of an Ashes-clinching side at The Oval but it was here that he saved his England skin with a century against Pakistan four years ago during what was, before now, the toughest time of his career. ‘We were running around the ground this morning and Stuart Broad said to me, “It doesn’t seem a year ago we were lifting the Ashes here”,’ said Cook. ‘I said, “It might not to you but it does to me!” ‘A lot has happened over the past year and I guess the beauty of sport is that you never know what’s going to happen next. ‘We’ve made a big stride forward over the last couple of weeks and this is another little challenge now. How do we cope when we’re up in the series? Can we finish the job? I hope the next year is a lot more successful and less eventful!’ There are certainly real signs of progress for England, through the form of the likes of Joe Root, Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali, but it is one of the senior core of players who have finally come to the fore in the last two thumping victories who is poised to hog the limelight over the next five days. Jimmy Anderson stands seven short of Sir Ian Botham’s record as England’s leading Test wicket-taker and Cook paid tribute to the leader of his attack while remembering the uncertain start of their relationship. ‘If he breaks the record here it will probably mean England are in a very strong position,’ said Cook. ‘It’s an amazing achievement for the most skilful bowler in the world. All smiles: Alastair Cook has been questioned but is re-finding form in both his batting and captaincy . VIDEO Captain Cook focused on series win . Mean Machine: James Anderson is on the cusp of becoming England's all-time leading Test wicket taker . Long time ago: England don't appear to be missing the sacked Kevin Pietersen this summer . ‘You saw his guts and determination last week when he was bowling so well at Old Trafford despite being ill. That tells me what sort of bloke he is and to back that up with talent and skill makes him a very fine bowler.’ The pair are firm friends but it was not that way when they first met. ‘I played against Jimmy for Essex against Lancashire and he called me all the names under the sun,’ said Cook. ‘Then we went on an A tour of West Indies together and we never spoke. We both got called up by England to go to India and I thought, “This is going to be an interesting 48 hours”. But we talked on the plane and now we’re good friends. What amazes me is how he keeps trying to improve.’ If all eyes will be on Anderson and Broad — who will play with either a splint or a mask protecting his broken nose — then there will be three other England players with much to prove against what looks a deflated India. This is a huge game for Sam Robson who, since hitting a century against Sri Lanka in his second Test, has struggled outside off stump and it is conceivably his last chance to prove he should open against his native Australia next year. ‘It is vitally important we get a settled partnership at the top of the order,’ said Cook. ‘Robbo has had a tough couple of games but that can happen when you open. ‘This is a hurdle he has to get over and I’ve no doubt he can do it. He has to back his ability to score runs and prove himself as an international performer.’ The stakes are almost as high for Chris Woakes and Chris Jordan, who both seem certain to keep their places ahead of Ben Stokes and Steven Finn despite failing to convince in this series that they are the right back-up to the big two. Yet England’s problems suddenly seem so much smaller than those of India, who have fallen apart and lost focus so spectacularly over the last two Tests in Southampton and Manchester after winning so impressively at Lord’s. Man on a mission: Anderson has been England's key man in recent Tests as they recorded two wins . Ishant Sharma, who destroyed England with seven wickets on that last, turbulent day at Lord’s, is fit to return, which should give India a boost, but whether captain MS Dhoni is in the mood to capitalise on it remains in doubt. Dhoni’s captaincy and performance on the last day at Old Trafford were little short of bizarre and, incredibly, he decided to have a day off on Wednesday, apparently to indulge his hobby of shooting, rather than practise with the rest of his side. It is the sort of behaviour that would lead to castigation if he were England captain. ‘I felt like having a day off and took one,’ said a dismissive Dhoni. ‘It’s personal. I was with the team for the three days after Old Trafford and we had enough team-building activities. One more day won’t make any difference.’ It is an arrogant attitude which should help England’s attempt to seal a series win here that would mean the world to them and vindicate their own captain.

"By . Joe Bernstein . Having taken dog’s abuse from Arsenal fans for daring to leave The Emirates, Manchester City’s Premier League title winner Samir Nasri is in no mood to deliberately open up old wounds ahead of the Community Shield clash against his former club at Wembley on Sunday. But ask the 27-year-old son of Marseille a direct question and you’ll usually get a direct answer, which is why he doesn’t consider Arsene Wenger’s new-look team, boosted by the arrival of Alexis Sanchez, genuine challengers for City’s championship crown just yet. ‘I think Chelsea will be the biggest threat. For me, Arsenal still have a weakness in defensive mid and at centre-back,’ he says without any thought of shirking the issue. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Samir Nasri get abused by Arsenal and Liverpool fans . One of us: Nasri has performed well in recent seasons at City, winning over the fans . Back then: Nasri in his Arsenal days before moving to Manchester City in 2011 . ‘Chelsea’s signings have really caught my eye. Cesc Fabregas is a great replacement for Frank Lampard, I know that from playing with him at Arsenal. They had a weakness up front so they've signed Diego Costa who was great for Atletico Madrid last season. They lost Ashley Cole but bought in Filipe Luis. ‘They have also done their business fast so the players have had time to spend working together. They will be really dangerous.’ As for the rest, Nasri is slightly skeptical, particularly as he thinks Chilean World Cup star Sanchez will need time to bed in after his £35million move from Barcelona. ‘Liverpool have bought a lot of players but they have also lost (Luis) Suarez and it’s really hard to replace a guy like this. ‘For Arsenal, Sanchez has the quality, but the Premier League is not La Liga. It is really, really hard. ‘We saw that with Mesut Ozil last year. We expected a lot from him and at the start of the season he was brilliant. But he found out when every other league has a break in December, you carry on playing in England. 'Stupid': Nasri is given stick by Arsenal fans as he sits on the bench at the Emirates in 2012 . Content: Nasri is now enjoying his football at the Etihad, with two Premier League titles in three years . 'It is tough and I think players need a year to adapt. We had the same with Stevan Jovetic at City. He had a lot of injuries in his first year, now he’s come back second time around and is flying in pre-season. ‘The only player I know who came in from abroad and made an impact during his first season was Sergio Aguero at City. The rest at some point have all had their ups and downs.’ Dissing Arsenal’s title chances and politely suggesting we might have to wait 12 months to see the best of Sanchez isn’t going to go down well with Gunners fans who accused Nasri of joining City for the money in 2011. A video of him being abused by Arsenal supporters was posted online last year when he went to The Emirates as a spectator to see them play City. Nasri doesn’t seem to think the situation will ever alter but describes the animosity as “stupid” and believes fans are misguided to think professional players should feel the same blind loyalty to clubs as they do. ‘The abuse doesn’t affect me on the pitch, I just think it’s stupid. I’m not an Arsenal fan, I am not from London. If we want to be honest, we are players who look at what is in the the best interests for us and our career,’ he says. In the community: Samir Nasri was speaking at Manchester City’s Community Shield Media Day at Carrington . ‘When Manchester City came, it was the best choice for me to come here. And today I have won trophies, I am really happy, I have everything and I have a better life. ‘If the fans can’t move on then it’s too bad. But me, I am not trying to have a problem with that. They do what they have to do, they love their club, maybe they saw it as treason or that I betrayed them. But it’s not that. I’m not like that. ‘I just look at for what’s best for me; and that’s what Bacary Sagna did, Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure.’ Those three players have all left Arsenal for City in recent seasons, as well as Nasri and Gael Clichy. Nasri accepts financial reasons play a part – City pay the biggest wages per player than any team in world sport – but insists it’s not the only consideration top players take into account. ‘Fans think it must be for the money. But it’s not just the money. Ok, it’s a factor, it’s important nowadays. But if someone earns 200 (thousand) a week or 150 or 100 a week, it’s not going to make a difference or an impact on your life, so that’s not true. ‘I am in debt to Arsene Wenger at Arsenal. If I am this player today, it is because of him. But I don’t need to explain myself, what I have done with Manchester City should be enough and I don’t have to point to it all the time.’ In debt: Nasri says he is the player he is today because of former boss Arsene Wenger . Nasri has won two Premier League titles and a Capital One Cup in three seasons at City, vindication that moving to The Etihad was the right thing do to even if Sir Alex Ferguson went on a charm offensive at the time to take him to United. The midfielder was excellent last season, a player who benefitted from Roberto Mancini leaving and Pellegrini arriving, and now wants to improve again, particularly to help City in the Champions League after three consecutive failures. A five-year contract signed this summer underlines he is firmly part of the club’s long-term plans. ‘I think we have the best squad,’ he states. ‘We have four strikers that I would qualify as world class – Edin Dzeko, Alvaro Negredo, Jovetic and Aguero. Next up: City players train in preparation for the Community Shield final at Wembley on Sunday . ‘Then we have four on the wing in Jesus Navas, David Silva, James Milner and myself. We have Yaya Toure who can score 20 goals and have improved the group from last year with some players at the back which was our weakness.’ His club form hasn’t translated onto the international stage and having been axed from the French World Cup squad, won’t wear the dark blue of his country again. It’s allowed his mind to focus fully on what lies ahead with City. First up, it’s Wembley this afternoon. ‘It is not a glorified friendly,’ he declares. ‘Playing Arsenal is always something special and we need to show we are ready for the start of the Premier League the following weekend.’ Samir Nasri was speaking at Manchester City’s Community Shield Media Day at Carrington, where he joined in to helped the Club’s Community Coaches train children from local schools and sports clubs.","Nasri has received abuse from Arsenal fans each time he returns to the club .

Swansea boss Garry Monk swapped his club suit and tie for a casual open neck and jeans on the touchline – but there was nothing dress down about his team’s display. The Welsh club who have started the Premier League with two wins in two looked smart as they eased their way into the Capital One cup’s third round. And Monk, who made ten changes to the starting line-up that has beaten both Manchester United and Burnley, learned he’s got plenty in reserve.

Subs not used: Collin, Brandy, Swift, Derbyshire. Booked: Arnason, Brindley, Broadfoot, Morgan. Referee: Stephen Martin 6.5. Man of the Match: Gomis. The rookie boss whose side stunned Old Trafford and provoked the spending spree that brought Angel di Maria to England for a British transfer record has played the transfer markets like a veteran. And it was the star signing of his summer, French international striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who got the crucial first half breakthrough. The 29-year-old, picked up for nothing from Lyon, showed the class that has brought him 12 France caps as he spun on to Nathan Dyer’s pass and placed a shot in the bottom corner. It was a perfect opening shot from Gomis in his battle to win the centre forward’s role from last season’s 24-goal top scorer Wilfried Bony. And when the Ivory Coast striker replaced the Frenchman late on he was desperate to get on the scoresheet himself – but fired over from 12 yards and saw another effort blocked on the line. Dyer, made captain for the night, was the one player who stayed in the side and was full of enthusiasm to enjoy his night. Having a go: Gomis tried his luck on a night when he endeared himself to the Liberty Stadium crowd . Dyer, made captain for the night, was the one player who stayed in the side and was full of enthusiasm to enjoy his night. His pace troubled the Championship new boys early on and he was so proud of the chance to skipper the side that he refused to come off despite a nasty head wound in the second half. Dyer’s enthusiasm set the tone for a committed home display, and Monk also saw a quality debut from his own Argentinian World Cup star, centre half Federico Fernandez, who cost little more than a tenth of what United have paid for Di Maria. And alongside him former Arsenal youngster Kyle Bartley had an outstanding night to suggest that the Swans have plenty of depth in their squad. Competitive: Rotherham battled hard but were unable to force an equaliser against Swansea . There were even some promising cameos from academy graduates Josh Sheehan and Jay Fulton. Rotherham boss Steve Evans made five changes to the team that beat Millwall, and clearly wanted to gain some momentum from a Cup success. But midfield man Lee Frecklington wasted their one big opportunity when with half an hour gone he volleyed over the bar from six yards. However all the time there was only one goal in it, boss Evans knew his side had a chance and he turned away in despair when sub Conor Newton drove a late chance to equalise over the bar. Evans could constantly be seen arguing with the fourth official when decisions didn’t go his way, but the truth was that Swansea – even in dress down mode – had far too much quality.

"By . Hamish Mackay . European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley has withdrawn from the USPGA Championship due to a shoulder injury. The 47-year-old missed the Alstom Open de France at the beginning of July as a bout of bursitis affected the mobility in his left shoulder and the condition has ruled him out of next week's major tournament at Valhalla Golf Club. The Irishman undertook a scan during the Scottish Open and a period of rest has now been prescribed. Recovery: Paul McGinley says he was forced to pull out of the USPGA as his shoulder needs time to recover . McGinley said: 'The scan showed that I really needed to rest my shoulder for a couple of months if I am to address the injury properly and so, because of that, I have regrettably had to withdraw from the USPGA Championship. 'It's a pity because I would have loved to have teed up at Valhalla but I assessed the situation over the past couple of weeks during my family holiday and I think this is the sensible decision. 'It's not just during the week of the tournament itself that is the problem, it is the fact that the injury also hampers my normal preparation for events and you do not want to be going into any tournament - far less a major championship - not properly prepared.' The news will not be welcomed by European fans. The Ryder Cup is less than two months away and while there has been no suggestion that McGinley is in danger of missing the tournament, it will undoubtedly affect his preparation and form going in to it.

Langer's 13-stroke win is the largest margin of victory in a senior major, beating Hale Irwin's 12-stroke win in the Senior PGA Championship in 1997, while he almost doubled Bob Charles' record of seven strokes in the British event, set at Turnberry back in 1989.

"By . Pa Reporter . Crystal Palace co-chairman Steve Parish does not feel let down by former boss Tony Pulis but expects to see him working again soon. Pulis stunned Palace by asking to leave his role as manager just two days before the season started, with Parish agreeing to his request. Former Stoke boss Pulis - who guided Palace to a miraculous escape last season - was reportedly unhappy with the way the club had done their transfer business in the summer. No regrets: Crystal Palace co-chairman Steve Parish (centre), pictured on Saturday in the stands at the Emirates Stadium, allowed manager Tony Pulis to leave two days before the start of the season . All change: Parish and Pulis didn't see eye-to-eye over transfer targets over the summer . But although Parish is sad to see the Welshman move on, he is adamant he did the right thing by not stopping him from walking. 'I can't explain it, I'd love to be able to tell you everything that went wrong,' he told Match of the Day. 'There was a good transfer budget agreed, there was a lack of targets that I think the manager felt was good enough in the window and it came to a point where he felt he didn't want to carry on. 'I can't have people at the football club who aren't 100 per cent committed to what we're trying to do, so reluctantly I agreed to let him out of his contract. Interim: Keith Millen has been appointed caretaker manager at Palace . Late blow: Aaron Ramsey scored Arsenal's winner at the Emirates as Palace were beaten in stoppage time . 'I can't be let down for what he achieved for us. He doesn't owe us but we don't owe him. He did a fantastic job for us but we are what we are. I got this club from administration to where we are now by taking decisions to create a positive environment. 'If people don't feel they can work in that environment then it's fine for them to move on.'

"By . Mike Dawes . South Africa's Tim Clark shot a final-day 65 to snatch a victory away from Jim Furyk at the Canadian Open and earn his second PGA title. Furyk led by three shots going into the last round as he sought a third Canadian Open crown but the veteran American could only card a one-under-par 69 to open the door to nearest challenger Clark at Royal Montreal Golf Club. And the 38-year-old took full advantage with a five-under round that saw him come back in just 30 - thanks to a superb spell of putting - to finish on a 17-under total of 263, equalling the tournament record, and one shot clear of Furyk. Comeback: Tim Clark shot a final-day 65 to win the Canadian Open . Sportsmanship: Jim Furyk congratulates Clark after he claws back his three-shot lead . Clark had a poor start to the rain-affected final day with a bogey on the par-four first, but he cancelled that out on the sixth to reach the turn in level par, before hitting a hot streak that brought him further birdies on the 11th, 12th, 14th, 15th and 17th. Furyk, champion in 2006 and 2007, could not compete with that, managing his only back-nine birdie on the penultimate hole as Clark added the Canadian Open title to his triumph at The Players Championship in 2002. Justin Hicks was three shots behind Furyk in third after closing with an impressive 64, with fourth place being shared between Matt Kuchar (65), Michael Putnam (66) and Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano (66) on 11 under. Fallen: Furyk couldn't get away from his opponent as he was outdone on Sunday . Surge: Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell finished in the group on nine under par in Montreal . Dicky Pride played the round of the day as his seven-under-par 63 matched the course record - which was also equalled by Furyk on Friday. That left Pride on 10 under, alongside local hope Graham DeLaet. Former US Open champion Graeme McDowell was in the group on nine under, while Scottish duo Martin Laird and Russell Knox finished on five under - all three players carding final-day 68s.

"By . Sean Gallagher . Arsenal have completed the signing of Nice goalkeeper David Ospina for £3.2million, according to the French side's manager Claude Puel. Ospina alerted interest from the Gunners following a series of impressive performances for Colombia at the World Cup - helping them to reach the quarter-finals before losing to hosts Brazil. The 25-year-old joins the north London side on a reported four-year deal. Puel revealed the news of Ospina's departure on Sky Sports News saying: 'It is confirmed, yes. At 25 years old it is important for him to experience another championship, so it is a fantastic move for him.' It was believed that the 25-year-old was initially pinpointed as a ready-made replacement for back-up keeper Lukasz Fabianski, who recently joined Swansea, with Wojciech Szczesny the current No 1 at the club. However, Arsene Wenger has insisted that performances will dictate who holds the No 1 position this season at the club, as Ospina looks to stake a claim for a first-team spot. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsenal train at the home of the New York Red Bulls . Playing for keeps: David Ospina (L) will challenge Wojciech Szczesny to become Arsenal No 1 . Shop window: David Ospina helped Colombia reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Brazil . 'You know at the start Szczensy will be . the No. 1, then again it will be down to performances and, if Ospina shows . that he is better, he will play,' he told ESPN. Puel has no doubt in his mind though that his former keeper can become an instant success at the Emirates and land himself the No 1 jersey. He added: . 'I think he can take the No. 1 spot at Arsenal because his qualities are . very, very strong. He is very good with his feet, with his arms, and he . knows soccer. He is a very, very good player.' Ospina will join Alexis Sanchez and Mathieu Debuchy as new signings at the Emirates next season, while the club has also been linked with a move for Porto's £35 million-rated defensive midfielder William Carvalho. They are also believed to be close to sealing a deal to take highly-rated Southampton defender Calum Chambers to the club for £12million. Wenger believes that the new additions the club has made now means they will make a sustained challenge for the Premier League title this season, after falling somewhat short over the last few years. Good old days: Arsene Wenger speaks to Thierry Henry ahead of Arsenal's friendly against New York Red Bulls . Another level: The signing of Alexis Sanchez shows that Arsenal can compete in the transfer market . Speaking at a press conference ahead of his side's pre-season friendly with New York Red Bulls, Wenger agreed that Arsenal were looking to repeat the success they have enjoyed in the past. 'That's what our target is but still I think we have been very consistent,' he said. 'It was a very different period initially because we built a new stadium and had to pay it back. We survived at the top level but we want more.

"By . Dave Wood . Alan Shearer has warned Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal that he needs to sign three world-class players just to make the top four. The Red Devils are desperate to make up for their Champions League failure this season and the Dutchman vowed to spend after watching his injury-hit side lose 2-1 at home to Swansea on the opening day of the Premier League season. And Match of the Day presenter Shearer said Saturday's disappointing defeat at Old Trafford could be a 'blessing in disguise'. VIDEO Scroll down for Van Gaal: Our confidence will be smashed down with this result . Hammer blow: Swansea City's Gylfi Sigurosson scores the winner at Old Trafford on Saturday . He said: 'As poor a performance as it was, and a poor result, it could be a blessing in disguise because it could say to the money men at Manchester United they need at least three world class players. 'They need big money to be spent on top, top players to get into the top four let alone to challenge for the championship.' United's pursuit of players during the summer has been hampered by their failure to qualify for the Champions League. Tough start: Louis van Gaal knows he has a big job on his hands at Manchester United . Shearer added: 'It's similar to last season when they left it late to sign players and they were found wanting.' Dutchman Ruud Gullit expressed surprise that Van Gaal had ditched the attacking philosophy that had served his fellow-countryman so well during his spells in charge at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, . He said: 'My biggest surprise was when he played the 3-5-2 system with Holland it was a necessity because we had bad defenders. Warning: Alan Shearer and Ruud Gullit highlighted problems for Van Gaal on Match of the Day . 'But at Manchester United you have to play attacking football and he adapted the game he did with the national team. 'At Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich he played 4-4-3, and always attacking football and now all of a sudden he's going to play this way.'","Swansea defeat could be 'blessing in disguise' for Manchester United boss .

"By . Martin Allen . Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. This week, Mad Dog has his say on Ray Wilkins' suitability for another job in football, Sam Allardyce's football is producing results at West Ham, and what he has which is 'similar' to Dennis Bergkamp's statue at Arsenal... UPS AND DOWNS . I thought Ray Wilkins was very open and honest talking candidly about his mental health in football throughout his career, after his dismissal from Fulham last week. It's something many managers and coaches, including myself, have to overcome. Losing your job in any walk of life is tough. But being in the public eye in a job that you love, the incredible highs and lows, always being busy, it can be very difficult to cope. Brave: Ray Willkins spoke openly about his illness throughout his career after his dismissal from Fulham . Experience: Any club would be lucky to have a coach of Wilkins' standard . Click here to read Matt Lawton's exclusive interview with Ray Wilkins . You are a councillor, decision-maker, long-term and short-term planner, recruiter, teacher, charity worker, supporter and mentor. As well as picking the team and sorting out training for the players. Then it's just one phone-call, or text message, or email, and it stops. Just like that. Soon the texts and phone-calls stop and the buzz – the same buzz as all supporters feel come match-day times 100 – is gone from your life. You're lonely, isolated and wondering what the future brings. I'm not sure how you define depression. But I've felt a lack of energy, questioning your own ability, questioning if you'll ever work again and generally feeling fed up, sad and, at the want of a better word, bereavement. Frank: Wilkins was speaking to Sportsmail's Matt Lawton about his troubles . Everyone else gets on with their lives and I guess that feeling is called depression. I'm sure Ray will get an opportunity in football once again. He's a gentleman, full of knowledge, had great success and I see it as a strength that he has got help from a therapist and specialists in place to support him and, most of all, give him guidance for the future. This will, in my opinion, improve him and he will get better as a manager or coach. God bless. We must never forget, although people quickly do, the tragic loss of Gary Speed less than two years ago, who seemed bright and bubbly on Football Focus just the day before. I believe more has to be done to help and support managers who are out of work. LUKE'S A SHAW THING FOR ENGLAND . On Saturday I got the chance to visit my old stomping ground to watch West Ham versus Southampton. I'll tell you one thing I'm sure about and that's Southampton's 18-year-old left-back Luke Shaw. He's got pace, he's also got another gear, and goes forward with intent to do damage in the final third. He was tested one-on-one defensively all afternoon and he didn't get beaten once. Solid: Luke Shaw has the credentials to go all the way, he didn't get beaten once against West Ham . Competition: I can see Shaw usurping Ashley Cole (left) and Leighton Baines in the England team . Perhaps his decision-making in defence was at fault when he didn't track Matt Jarvis's run for West Ham's first goal. But in time, and with experience, that will improve. It looks from afar that Chelsea are letting Ashley Cole slowly run-down his contract and my guess would be that young Shaw will be moving to Stamford Bridge in the summer. With Leighton Baines edging towards 30 - though, it must be said, he has improved with age like a fine bottle of wine - I'm sure young Shaw will be filling the England left back spot for many, many years to come. THE WEST HAM WAY . A lot has been said about Sam Allardyce's way of playing. But I have not yet seen a book or manual that states how you have got to play to win a game of football. Sam has his way and after four straight wins, with his main players now available, not one West Ham supporter would've left Upton Park without a spring in their step and the claret-and-blue blood bubbling around their body. Southampton's Mauricio Pochettino had his team playing from the goalkeeper, through the back four, then the midfield, into the forwards, with both full backs overlapping. They were focused on ball retention and moving the opposition to create openings, with a South American style that is good to watch. Results: Sam Allardyce is getting the three points with his system, and has lifted West Ham into the top half . Route one: Kevin Nolan's goal typified the impressive performance . On Saturday, when the Saints goalkeeper had a goal kick, Southampton's two centre halves pulled deep and wide, level with their own six yard box and the two central midfield players dropped off to the edge of the penalty area to receive passes to start their attack. At no point did he smash it long. If those players were marked the keeper attempted a 30-yard pass with the full backs pushed high-up and wide in the wing positions. West Ham's goalkeeper, Adrian, kicked the ball 70 yards directly to Carlton Cole and in one instance the knock-down came to Kevin Nolan. Regret? Mauricio Pochettino had his team pass the ball out in defeat, while West Ham celebrate the win (below) His half-volley attempt at goal was blocked and the next pass was played to Stewart Downing, who on his second touch tried to get a cross in. It was blocked and went off for a corner. With only three passes the Upton Park crowd were on the edge of their seats in eager anticipation as the corner came in. The crowd loved it and at the end of the day, with three points on the board, I'm sure not one West Ham supporter could turn round and say, 'I don't know why we don't play out from the back and tip-tap it about in our own 18-yard box'. NO MATCH-WINNERS, NO WINS . A lot has been made about the lack of goals from the Barclays Premier League teams in Europe last week. But it surely can come as no surprise. Swansea City didn't have Michu playing. Tottenham were missing Emmanuel Adebayor. Man City didn't have Sergio Aguero in their side. Arsenal, no Olivier Giroud. No surprise: Manchester City and Arsenal were missing their main strikers in midweek in Sergio Aguero (left) and Olivier Giroud . So the main strikers, the match-winners, who win these games and make the difference, if you don't have them playing, you don't win. If Arsenal had signed Luis Suarez they'd have won the Premier League and gone very close in the Champions League this season. Yaya Sanogo looks decent, but he's hardly Suarez, Dennis Bergkamp or Thierry Henry, is he? Potential: But Yaya Sanogo isn't going to be the next Arsenal legend (like Luis Suarez could have been), is he? MAD HOT DOG . Speaking of Bergkamp, I see Arsenal have recognised the incredible contribution of one of the game's most amazing players with a statue at the Emirates. His incredible talent was so similar to Eric Cantona, with his arrogance and supreme confidence. He used to strut around like the King of Highbury, more often than not walking with his eyes squinted like a kestrel looking calmly and quietly for the gap or the opening where he could punish the opposition. He was magnificent, one of best of all time. Legend: Dennis Bergkamp deserves his statue outside the Emirates Stadium . Not quite: The closest I've ever come is... a Chilli Mad Dog! In 2012 they unveiled a statue of Sir Alex Ferguson outside Old Trafford. At West Ham, you've got the famous Bobby Moore Stand. In Chelsea's Stamford Bridge they've got the Zola Lounge. There are loads of them. And a couple of years ago my son George rang me with the news that a street vendor was selling a hotdog with chilli and mustard called the Chilli Mad Dog. Sadly no stand, or statue. On Tuesday night, Vassos Alexander and . Chris Hollins were left speechless for the very first time when I was . with them on BT's SportsHUB. They were shocked and horrified with my prediction that England would win the World Cup. With . their mouths wide open, and all planning from rehearsals now out the . window, I explained that with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Raheem Sterling, . Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck, Daniel Sturridge, Wayne Rooney, and with . Stevie G playing deep in front of the back four, we have a team with . pace and self-belief that can test and challenge the very best. You just wait and see.","More has to be done to help coaches like Ray Wilkins .

"By . Chris Cutmore . Follow @@Chris_Cutmore . Rory McIlroy admitted he cut his Open party short in order to immediately focus on adding to his major haul and completing the career grand slam at the Masters next spring. The 25-year-old Northern Irishman became the third youngest player - after Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus - to win three majors and celebrated his glorious triumph at Hoylake in a Liverpool nightclub, followed by a champagne-fuelled session in Belfast with old friends the following evening. But with the US PGA Championship held at Valhalla in just the second week of August, the last thing McIlroy wants is a hangover and by Wednesday he was already enduring an intense fitness session at the GSK Human Performance Lab in London.

Party time: McIlroy's friend and mother filled the Claret Jug with Jagermeister on Sunday night . McIlroy is in no mood to let major tournaments slip by while he is in the form of his life, and his sights are already set on both the year's final major and then the big one at Augusta next April, where he can become only the sixth player in history to complete the full set. 'That’s an immense thing to aim for and I still can’t believe I’ll be going in at 25 with a chance,' McIlroy, who turns 26 next May, told The Telegraph. 'For me it’ll always be all about the majors. In the Tiger era, their importance has become massive. They’re the storyline, they’re the narrative: ""How many majors have you won?"" not ""How many tournaments have you won?"". Despite his already burgeoning major haul, McIlroy has had a mercurial and at times turbulent career, but since breaking off his engagement to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki in May he has won both the prestigious BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth and now The Open. The former US Open and US PGA champion intends to strike while his irons are hot. The greatest prize in golf: McIlroy lifts the Claret Jug after winning The Open at Hoylake last Sunday . VIDEO The Open Championship: Final Round . 'I’m 25, and realistically I have 15 more years at the top of my game - that’s 60 chances or so,' he said. 'And since the 2011 US Open, I’ve won three in 14 majors. As everybody knows I’ve had some up and downs in that time, but I would have taken that return. Jeez, would I? That’s nearly one a year – and I can add up, you know.' Pictures have emerged from last Sunday night in Liverpool that suggest a wild party - friends and family were shown filling the Claret Jug with Jagermeister - but McIlroy admitted clubbing with his parents was 'a bit surreal and weird.' Fine company: McIlroy is bidding to join Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as winners of golf's grand slam . Monday's bash was a wilder one, with many bottles of champagne filling the famous old trophy as it was passed round a big table of friends to swill from. McIlroy admits that was the night he truly 'let my hair down.' But McIlroy insists the party is over for now while he chases sporting immortality. Only Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Nicklaus and Woods have achieved the grand slam, but McIlroy is already three quarters of the way there. 'I’ve turned a corner in everything,' he said. 'I’m on a good path; the game’s good, mentally I’m good and I’ve never been so fit and healthy. So I’ll enjoy it but will keep going, foot down... there’ll be plenty of time to party.'","Rory McIlroy won The Open at Hoylake last Sunday .

I always say to the players that they must show respect to the . club and that when the manager makes a decision like this, it’s not . because someone has played poorly. ‘Sometimes . it is tactical or down to injury, but you accept coming off and sit . with the rest for the remainder of the game.

We . were desperate to come here and be ourselves and give a performance that . the fans could be extremely proud of, but we played a bit too much with . our hearts at times. Liverpool wanted to hit us on the counter, and we . should have used that to our advantage, but we didn’t. ‘We . seemed focused only on trying to score, and, as a consequence, we left . ourselves way too open.

Instead, what we have at the moment is a 19-year-old kid being pushed and pulled in every direction by every international team with half a chance of nicking him for their senior side. Welcome home: Adnan Januzaj arrives back in England from Dubai on Tuesday after Manchester United's warm-weather break (left), during which he was pictured posing with the legendary Diego Maradona (right) Catch him if you can: Januzaj in action for United during their draw against Fulham earlier this month . Take England. ‘We’re still in dialogue with FIFA,’ was the measured response from one of Roy Hodgson’s aides when England’s head coach was asked for an update on Januzaj’s naturalisation. Seriously, you would have thought we were dealing with a hostage crisis, not the international aspirations of a Manchester United substitute. There is a certain amount of sympathy for the predicament Hodgson finds himself in, even if he did direct a yorker at the feet of the FA board. He wants a policy decision from the FA on this sensitive situation, something that may well come long after Hodgson has departed as England’s head coach. Judging from the political noises in Kosovo, there are no such difficulties as they prepare to play their first international friendly, against Haiti, next month. Explosive entrance: The 19-year-old burst onto the scene with a double strike at Sunderland last year . Headache: The United winger is wanted by England but has several international options . Waiting for the call: England boss Roy Hodgson is a confirmed admirer of the talented youngster . The tie is an emotional one, with Januzaj’s family involvement in the country’s bloody battle for independence in the nineties a key factor in their attempts to secure him. These are noble and honourable arguments, but a gruesome war, with its origins centuries old, should not influence his final decision. Then there is Belgium, where Januzaj was born on February 5, 1995. On the basis of his birthplace, Marc Wilmots, the country’s international manager, has the greatest claim of all. Which brings us to the ‘English is English’ debate, a phrase coined by Ray Clemence when he was talking about Manuel Almunia in 2008. In FA Confidential, written by the FA’s former director of public affairs, it is claimed Sven Goran Eriksson wanted Carlo Cudicini (Italian), Steed Malbranque, Louis Saha (both French) and Edu (Brazilian) to represent the England national team. Clemence was vehemently opposed to Cudicini’s selection, arguing the case for young, emerging English goalkeepers. Back in 2008, Fabio Capello made it known he would consider Almunia, a Spanish national, if he acquired a British passport. England’s Italian-born manager did not want to push it publicly or privately, but he would have been considered for selection if he had become a naturalised citizen. Boy wonder: An even younger Januzaj holding trophies during a school tournament in Belgium . If the shirt fits... Januzaj (back left in Roma kit) poses for a team picture at Athenee Royal De Jette school . It was met with generational resistance, something Clemence, then England’s goalkeeping coach, spoke about at the time. ‘I am all for English goalkeepers in the England team,’ he said. ‘It’s as simple as that.’ Except it isn’t any more, is it? Taken in its purest form, this awkward phrase would mean discrimination at every turn. People would want proof that every Englishman had been born to the strains of Jerusalem in the delivery room. Take Graeme Le Saux as an example. Ask 10 people around you where Jersey is on the map and the majority of them will struggle to stick a pin in right place. But it doesn’t matter because Le Saux, who was born in the Channel Islands - St Helier, Jersey, in fact - went on to play 36 times for England. Before he chose England, presumably because he was playing in this country at the time with Blackburn, he was also eligible to play for Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and France. Tony Dorigo, a member of England’s 1990 . World Cup squad, was born in Melbourne, Australia. He qualified for a . British passport under residency rules and opted to play for England. Dorigo’s father is Italian, his mother Australian. That is an example of . the Januzaj principle and anyone who was around the England team at the . time of Dorigo’s change of nationality will tell you that they didn’t . bat an eyelid. Not born in England: Former Three Lions left-backs Graeme Le Saux (left) and Tony Dorigo (right) Ultimate prize: Marcel Desailly (right) kisses the World Cup in 1998 alongside Zinedine Zidane (centre) Still patriots: Lilian Thuram and Desailly were both born outside France but played for Les Bleus . Applied to other countries, little Odenke Abbey, born in Ghana in 1968, went on to lift the World Cup 30 years later with France. By then he had changed his name to Marcel Desailly and was widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished central defenders in the history of the game. Look at the pictures of Desailly, sent off with 10 minutes left to play in the Stade de France, celebrating with his team-mates at the final whistle. Lilian Thuram, the right-back, was born in Guadeloupe. Christian Karembeu was born in New Caledonia. Substitute Patrick Vieira was born in Senegal. Over in Spain, the success story at Euro 2008 began with Marcos Senna, born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, lifting the trophy after Fernando Torres scored the winner in the final. Senna, who made 28 appearances for his adopted country, was the 40th naturalised player in Spain’s history. In terms of international football, the lines are blurred by the increase in travel and the desire to experience life in other countries. If Januzaj chooses to play for England, we may never discover the reasons why. Then again, it shouldn’t matter.","Manchester United forward Adnan Januzaj is being coveted by England .
The 19-year-old can also play for Kosovo, Belgium, Turkey or Albania .
Just because star was born in Belgium does not mean he has to play for that national side .
Marcel Desailly is just one example of many stars born outside the country they played for at international level ."
"By . Jamie Redknapp . It’s always important to have a deep squad, and David Moyes will be delighted to have Danny Welbeck in his. With Robin van Persie out, Wayne Rooney has taken on the bulk of responsibilities up front, but Welbeck is now playing an absolutely vital role. He was a super sub at Norwich, scoring after coming on at half-time, and he now has four goals in his last four league games for United. Matchwinner: Danny Welbeck netted the only goal of the game for Manchester United against Norwich . Under Sir Alex Ferguson, Welbeck was struggling to score. Now Moyes has him doing that. Earlier this month he told Welbeck to follow Rooney’s example and stay behind after training to work on his finishing. It’s amazing to hear a manager having to encourage his players to work harder; that should be par for the course. I always looked at senior players and followed their work ethic but, in fairness, it seems to be working. Since the start of December, Welbeck’s scored twice as many goals as he had during the rest of the season and his shooting accuracy has improved by 10 per cent. Hull's pass master . Tom Huddlestone has been one of the signings of the season. The price of £5.25m was good business for Hull, good for Tottenham and good for Tom. He’s playing football and he’s become a bit of a cult hero. He’s such a technical footballer, has two great feet and he strikes the ball so cleanly. He hit a fierce shot with his left foot to score against Fulham and then smashed a 35-yard free-kick against the bar with his right. He hit it just like Cristiano Ronaldo. I love that Steve Bruce has brought in good footballers and Hull aren’t afraid to attack. George Boyd and Robert Koren were both terrific on Saturday, and Huddlestone orchestrates it all, sitting deep in that quarterback position. He really makes the team play and is . one of the best passers in the league, he can put it on a sixpence from . 50 yards. He’s formed a good midfield partnership with Jake Livermore in . the middle, and it helps that they both know each other from their . Spurs days. There is a . chance that Livermore could be recalled by Tim Sherwood, who is a fan, . but Huddlestone is at Hull to stay, and what a great signing he has been . for Steve Bruce. Clinical: Welbeck scored his fourth goal in as many Premier League games at Carrow Road . In action: Tom Huddlestone (right) was in stunning form against Fulham on Saturday afternoon . Goal threat: Huddlestone had a trim after finally scoring for Hull City at the KC Stadium . Influential: Huddlestone dominated in midfield, as his heat map from the Fulham clash shows . Fourth is still no bad thing . I’d love to ask Brendan Rodgers if he would take fourth place now. I fancied my old side for a Champions League spot this season but never thought they would be title contenders. They’re by no means out of it because this is a crazy season but in the last four seasons they have finished, on average, 27.5 points behind the title winners. To make up that difference in one season is a huge ask. Down but not out: Luis Suarez was unable to find the back of the net against a resolute Chelsea side . They’ve not been close for a number of years so they’re not yet used to that winning consistency, but it will come. They have benefited from not being in Europe this season, but the Champions League needs Liverpool in it. More than just a bench-warmer . Another striker that’s showing the value of a big squad is Edin Dzeko. He will see himself as a first-team player but with the form of Sergio Aguero and Alvaro Negredo, his chances have been limited this season. He’s a great player to have on the bench — he has scored 13 goals in 43 substitute appearances — but he will want more. He’s big, strong in the air and talented, and most teams would love to have him. Imagine the damage Chelsea would do if he was leading the line. It shows City’s strength, and Dzeko will be important for them over the next few weeks with Aguero out injured. Crucial: Edin Dzeko stepped up to the plate for Manchester City in their tight win against Crystal Palace . Clinical: Dzeko's intelligent movement created a space for Jesus Navas to pick him out in the penalty area . Eden's magic . When he first arrived, I wondered whether Eden Hazard would be Jose Mourinho’s kind of player. He likes his wingers to work hard but I think he knows that, even if he doesn’t track back, Hazard is a match-winner. They almost fell out when Hazard skipped training but Jose managed him well and you forget he’s still only 22. Just like that: Eden Hazard celebrates his equaliser against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge . Cardiff chaos . I thought I’d seen everything in football until Saturday night. The sight of Vincent Tan booing after the final whistle was utterly bizarre and it would be almost comical if it wasn’t such a desperate situation for the Cardiff fans. It doesn’t matter if he was booing his own players or his own fans, it’s not the kind of behaviour you would expect from an owner, but then Vincent Tan is not your average owner. He has already changed the club’s colours from blue to red, helped fund Cardiff’s promotion to the Premier League and then sacked an incredibly popular manager in Malky Mackay. Opinionated: Vincent Tan was filmed booing at the final whistle after Cardiff's 2-2 draw against Sunderland . Cardiff fans have waited more than 50 years to get back in the top flight, but so far their season has been engulfed in farce. Fans can put up with a lot of things if they feel the owner is committed and puts his money in, but their current situation is ridiculous. They need to bring in a manager and are keen on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but will he want to work with Tan? There’s no doubt any manager would love to manage a club like Cardiff City, but with Tan in charge, they may not be quite so happy to take the risk. Mutch to admire . Amid all the madness at Cardiff, there was one bright light for them on Saturday: Jordon Mutch. He’s only 22, but the midfielder is a fluid mover and good on the ball. He’s got an extra yard of pace that sets you apart and he has a fantastic attitude. People might criticise some of Malky Mackay’s signings, but Mutch was a bargain at £2million from Birmingham and could develop into something special. Stunned: Jordon Mutch scored Cardiff's opening goal against Sunderland from range .","David Moyes must love having Danny Welbeck in his United squad .

Mark Clattenburg is being investigated by referees’ chief Mike Riley after Southampton accused him of ‘abusing and insulting’ their captain, the England star Adam Lallana. Sportsmail can reveal that the extraordinary incident occurred in Southampton’s  2-1 defeat by Everton at Goodison Park last Sunday. Saints have written to the Premier League asking that Clattenburg is not appointed as an official for any of their matches until the investigation is over.

Last . season, Clattenburg was accused by Chelsea of racially abusing their . midfield player John Mikel Obi during a fiery Premier League clash . against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge. An FA inquiry concluded . there was no case to answer and Clattenburg was back in charge of a . Chelsea game six months after he had been accused of calling Mikel a . monkey. On Saturday, Clattenburg will officiate the high-profile FA Cup third-round tie at the Emirates between Arsenal and Tottenham. At his Friday press conference, Arsene Wenger said: 'I would be disappointed if he isn't the referee. You are innocent till proven guilty.'

Fuming: Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino let rip over the decision not to award a penalty . At his Friday press conference, Everton manager Roberto Matinez responded to the story: 'That's the first time I have heard that. I thought Mark Clattenburg had a very good game in terms of controlling the players and his manner. 'I don't think that that was the case. That's the first time I've heard any comment about that.’ According to sources close to the incident, . Clattenburg spoke to the player in a manner that is ‘not what you might . expect of one of the game’s top officials’. Saints manager Mauricio . Pochettino was furious with Clattenburg after the game and claimed the . South Coast club should have been awarded two spot-kicks. But . Southampton, who followed up their loss at Everton with a 3-0 defeat by . Chelsea at St Mary’s on New Year’s Day, have taken Pochettino’s . complaints a step further by writing to the Professional Game Match . Officials Ltd board. Riley is investigating the matter, but PGMOL and . the Premier League refused to comment. Merseyside mayhem: Clattenburg sent off Everton's Tony Hibbert during a fiery clash with Liverpool in 2007 . One that got away: Clattenburg did not send Dirk Kuyt off despite a lunge at Phil Neville at Goodison Park - the Dutchman went on to score two penalties as Liverpool beat their Merseyside rivals 2-1 back in 2007 . Riley is duty-bound . to speak with Clattenburg about Southampton’s claims and they are . expected to respond to the club’s letter within the next few days. Clattenburg is well known in the game for responding to verbal abuse from players with some choice phrases of his own. After the match at Goodison, Pochettino complained bitterly about Clattenburg’s handling of the game. The . Southampton manager said: ‘These things need to be said and I am . actually defending my club because it is my club and if I don’t talk I . am going to be seen as if I am dumb or I don’t care about my club. ‘I . don’t mean any disrespect against any referees but anyone watching the . game can see there were two clear penalties that weren’t given or should . have been given.

Cleared: Clattenburg returned to refereeing after investigations found him not guilty of any wrong-doing . Southampton assistant manager Perez has vowed Saints will not let the situation affect their preparations for hosting Burnley on Saturday. Refusing to go into detail on their complaint to PGMOL, Perez said he expects the club to find out more information in the next few days. 'I won't talk about this situation, I prefer to stay away from this and just focus on the game on Saturday,"" he said. 'This type of situation doesn't help us in this moment, for this game, it's away, and we'll see in the next couple of days what's happening with this. 'I read it this morning; when you are in the games sometimes you can see or hear something, but history has led me to stay away from these things.' ‘That would have changed the game completely but we weren’t given them and, of course, we are angry and upset about this. ‘I . am saying that should not be forgotten in the overall analysis of the . game and they need to be said. We don’t want to be judged by our young, . handsome, good-looking players. We just want what’s fair. We can be . a******s as well.’ Incredibly, last Sunday’s match was . Clattenburg’s first appointment at Goodison Park since his questionable . handling of the Merseyside derby won 2-1 by Liverpool in October 2007. On . that occasion he sent off Everton’s Tony Hibbert, allowed Liverpool’s . Dirk Kuyt to escape after he launched a kung-fu kick at Phil Neville and . ignored a penalty appeal when Jamie Carragher clashed with Joleon . Lescott. This weekend Clattenburg will be officiating Saturday's FA Cup third-round tie at the Emirates between Arsenal and Tottenham. MERSEY MADNESS, OCT 2007In the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, Clattenburg looked ready to book Everton’s Tony Hibbert but, after apparently consulting Liverpool’s Steven Gerrard, sent the defender off. He failed to show Dirk Kuyt a red card for a waist-high lunge and denied the hosts what looked a penalty in the final minutes. He did not referee an Everton match for five years and the game against Southampton was his first return to Goodison Park. SUSPENSION, JAN 2009After the winding-up of one of his businesses in the High Court, Clattenburg was suspended from refereeing and finally sacked by the referees’ governing body, the PGMO, for breaching his contract. He was accused of having business debts of nearly £200,000 and told he would never referee again, but he was reinstated that February after clearing his name. BASHING BELLAMY, DEC 2009In a match between Bolton and Manchester City, Clattenburg sent off Craig Bellamy for two bookable offences — dissent and diving. At half-time, he allegedly said to members of the City staff: ‘How do you work with Craig Bellamy all week?’ SEETHING SPURS, OCT 2010The referee had already caused problems between Tottenham and Manchester United when he failed to award Spurs a goal in 2005 after Pedro Mendes’ lob clearly crossed the line. Five years later, he correctly, if controversially, allowed a goal to stand when Nani tapped the ball in after goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes thought he had a free-kick. CLEARED OF RACE JIBE, OCT 2012Clattenburg was accused of aiming a racist insult towards Chelsea midfielder John Mikel Obi during their 3-2 home defeat by Manchester United. The FA and the Metropolitan Police launched inquiries into the incident, but a month later, dropped the investigation and Clattenburg was cleared. Mikel was later fined £60,000 and banned for three matches for threatening Clattenburg in the aftermath of the game.","Mark Clattenburg under investigation after being accused of 'abusing and insulting' Adam Lallana .

A team of computer researchers have studied millions of emails from Yahoo! Mail and have discovered that emails are most frequently sent between countries with certain similarities. A team of computer researchers have studied millions of emails from Yahoo! Mail and have discovered that emails are most frequently sent between countries with certain similarities. The researchers analysed emails over a period of 6 months in 2012. They worked out the user's location from their IP address, and anonymised the data so users could not be traced. The research, by Stanford University, Cornell University, Yahoo!, and Qatar’s Computational Research Institute, suggests that how many emails are exchanged between two countries is dependent upon their relative GDP, language and trade relations. The study also revealed that countries with tangible ties – such as a shared border, regular interconnecting flights, and close trade relationships – share the most emails. In the journal ArXiv the researchers wrote: ‘The ﬁndings (unsurprisingly) support the idea that geography, transportation and administrative decisions are all important determinants of between-country communication: distance decreases density, as do visas, while direct ﬂights increase it.’ However, there were some surprises. The . research revealed that people in different countries of the European . Economic Area email far less than the scientists predicted. It also showed that people in countries with colonial ties do not email more as a result. The researchers wrote: ‘Our ﬁndings in the main model with respect to contiguous borders and common European Economic Area membership appear surprising, as they decrease rather than increase density.' The US (left) unsurprisingly has strong links with the rest of the world.

'We focused on the flows of interpersonal communication as a bottom-up view of international alignments. 'To that end, we mapped the locations of the world’s countries in global email networks to see if we could detect cultural fault lines. 'Our analysis shows that email flows are consistent with Huntington’s thesis.' In addition to location in Huntington’s “civilizations,” our results also attest to the importance of both cultural and economic factors in the patterning of inter-country communication ties.'","Ten million Yahoo!

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . Marco Reus, Ilkay Gundogan, Fabio Coentrao, Paul Pogba and Arturo Vidal are among the names in circulation at Manchester United. They are the kind of reinforcements David Moyes will need if United are to challenge once again for the Barclays Premier League title. Aside from their wage demands, here are the two questions they will be asking of United’s chief executive Ed Woodward: . Crucial duo: Whether United sign anyone could depend on Robin van Persie (left) and Wayne Rooney . Turin talent: United have been watching Juventus midfield pair Paul Pogba (left) and Arturo Vidal . The fact that neither question can be answered by Moyes or Woodward is hardly a great selling point for one of the biggest clubs in world football. Without satisfactory answers to either of those questions, it is impossible for a top player to consider signing for Manchester United. In the last five seasons, Rooney has scored 85 goals in 137 Premier League appearances. Over the same period Van Persie has 90 in 128 in the league. If Rooney and Van Persie are not in the team, then United cannot hope to win a competitive Premier League, let alone the Champions League. Let’s be honest, Reus and Gundogan - who played in Borussia Dortmund’s midfield in last season's European Cup final - won’t fancy threading balls into the path of Javier Hernandez. Decent enough player, but Reus and Gundogan, who scored Dortmund’s equaliser in the final against Bayern Munich, operate on a different level: inside the Westfalenstadion they rely on Robert Lewandowski. Rooney and Van Persie are on the same wavelength, elite players who are capable of turning games with a twist of their hips and a finish to match. Can Pogba, who left United for Juventus in controversial circumstances two years ago, or Vidal really rely on the fading talents of Antonio Valencia or the inconsistency of Ashley Young on either wing? Probably not. Realistically, this United team is all about Rooney and Van Persie. Rooney, who earns £250,000 a week, is coming up 10 years as a United player. His future at Old Trafford is far from certain. There is nothing scheduled to discuss terms on a revised contract that will expire in less than 18 months. Dortmund duo: Marco Reus and Ilkay Gundogan (below) are also on David Moyes's radar . Since the interest from Chelsea last . summer, there has been nothing to suggest that Rooney will commit his . long-term future to United. It is still possible that the United forward, who has been in Egypt with his family recovering from injury, will leave in the summer. There is, of course, an argument that United must cash in at the end of the season to prevent him walking away on a free transfer in the June 2015. The practicality is that United wrote off his transfer valuation five years after he was signed from Everton for 2004. Anything they get from here is a bonus. To meet accounting standards, the £28m United paid for him was amortised between 2004, when he left Goodison Park, and 2009. So, anything United . get for Rooney from here is good business because his transfer fee . from Everton was effectively written off five years ago. Left back on the agenda: Fabio Coentrao, here training with Cristiano Ronaldo, is a long-term United target . Rooney is one issue for incoming players and Van Persie, especially his continued absence from the United team, is another. We . have been here before with Van Persie when he was at Arsenal, when . injuries disrupted the early periods of his career in north London. He has only played two full seasons in the Premier League since his move to England from Feyenoord in the summer of 2004. Two years ago, when he was elevated to the role of captain at Arsenal, he played in every league game and scored 30 goals. Talisman: Wayne Rooney (right) has been United's best player this season but is yet to sign a new deal . Hold on to them! Van Persie (right) and Rooney (centre) celebrate the Dutchman's goal against Arsenal . Last . season at United, when he won the title in his first season at Old . Trafford, he scored 26 times in 38 Premier League appearances. Now he is sidelined with niggling injuries and no-one, including Moyes, knows when he will return. Van . Persie, who is captain of the Holland team who will be appearing at the . World Cup in Brazil this summer, has not played since December 10. His . last goal was against Arsenal, the winner at Old . Trafford on Novemer 10 after 27 minutes. Watching brief: Moyes ran the rule over Pogba and Vidal in Juve's weekend match at Cagliari . This may be unfounded, but it doesn’t feel as though he has the same appetite for the game now that he finally has a Premier League medal. For someone struggling with groin and toe injuries, he has been out of the game for a long time. His return date is unspecified. Him and Rooney are the two players that can make a difference when it comes to lifting silverware at the end of a season. Without them, United simply don't have the same appeal.","Manchester United need to decide on Wayne Rooney's future now .

Above, Sir Cliff sips Bollinger champagne (left) from a glass using a straw (right) Engaging in discussion: Sir Cliff donned a purple top with a red shirt underneath for his trip to the pizzeria . Smiling: Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell (second from left), and a woman believed to be his his wife Majella (in sunglasses) joined Sir Cliff and his friends on the balcony . The 73-year-old smiled, laughed and engaged in light-hearted discussion with his six companions, which included his loyal friend and former priest John McElynn, as well as Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell and his wife Majella. He then sipped Bollinger champagne from a straw as they watched the sunset. Mr O'Donnell, who has known Sir Cliff since the 1980s, has publicly backed his friend, describing the star's treatment by police as 'unfair'. Speaking to the Belfast Telegraph, Mr O'Donnell described Sir Cliff as a 'really genuine, good person who would do nothing to anybody, least of all a child'. He added: 'I think the way it has all been conducted is definitely unfair and not in keeping with the law. It is like there is some kind of witch- hunt.'

Just hours earlier, Sir Cliff travelled to Britain on a private jet to attend a police premises in South Yorkshire. The star voluntarily met officers who interviewed him under caution. He was not arrested or charged over the allegation of sexual assault on a boy under 16 at an event held by American evangelist Billy Graham at Sheffield United’s Bramall Lane stadium in 1985. Afterwards, Sir Cliff is thought to have taken a private plane direct from Doncaster to Faro, arriving at 9pm on Saturday night.

Following the raid on Sir Cliff's Berkshire home on August 14, the police chief leading the inquiry accused the BBC of a ‘cover-up’ over how its journalists learned the star’s property would be raided. The Corporation has received 762 complaints over its live coverage of the incident. Sir Cliff - who was not given any prior warning of the raid - was said to be furious it was broadcast on TV before he had been spoken to by police. Meanwhile, Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the claims of a cover-up were a ‘matter of deep concern’. Companions: John McElynn (second left) is pictured with Mr and Mrs O'Donnell,  and a waiter (far left) at the restaurant .

"By . Wayne Gardiner . David Hockaday has launched a defiant defence of his position as Leeds head coach and stated his desire to be with the club on a journey to the Champions League. Fourteen years have passed since Leeds were competing with Europe's elite and Hockaday is the latest man to have been tasked with setting the club back on the road to former glories. His time in charge looked to have ended at the weekend, though, when owner Massimo Cellino decided to sack him just five games into his tenure, only to perform a dramatic U-turn and then place the blame for the club's poor start to the Championship season on himself and defender Giuseppe Bellusci. In charge for now: Hockaday is still Leeds United manager after a dramatic U-turn from owner Massimo Cellino . Tough start: Under Hockaday Leeds United have lost three of their opening four Championship fixtures . The Italian - who infamously sacked and reinstated Brian McDermott inside a mad 24 hours back in February - decided that Bellusci was at fault for getting sent off in the 4-1 loss at Watford and that he himself had to shoulder responsibility for not giving Hockaday enough players. That earned former Forest Green boss Hockaday an unexpected reprieve, but he insisted on Tuesday that he had never been aware that he was on the verge of losing his job anyway. 'I can't even comment on things I have read, what people have said or reportedly said. I had a calm, two-hour conversation with the president on Sunday, we spoke about the game, the defining moment of the game,' he said. 'We talked through players needed and everything and so it wasn't even addressed. It is what it is, I'm here, coaching, I love my role, my players and I am getting a lot out of them. U-turn: Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino (right) has earned a reputation as a 'manager eater' at Cagliari . 'I run my life by controlling the controllables. I will manage the game when it's being played, coach my players and anything outside of that is out of my hands. 'I'm just a hard-working guy who loves his job and that's what I will continue to do.' With Forest Green the only club on his managerial resume, Hockaday was a surprise appointment when Cellino unveiled him after being tipped off about the 56-year-old by someone he claims he cannot remember. As such, and with Cellino earning a reputation as the 'manager eater' after going through 36 managers in 20 years at Cagliari, few gave Hockaday as much time as he has already had - at present 68 days. Fond memories: Leeds United reached the semi-final of the Champions League in 2001, losing to Valencia . He says, though, that despite the sideshow about his future, he is determined to be a part of what Cellino is trying to build at Elland Road. 'When I have a conversation with the president and we talk about the club and the way forward and getting players in, that makes me happy,' he added. 'It shows me there's a future for everybody. It shows me that the president, however he is portrayed, is unbelievably passionate about this football club. I am not just saying it, I mean it. 'This guy wants Leeds to be in the Champions League, he does. I believe over time that will happen. I think it's inevitable. The timescale I don't know, I want to be part of that journey, a big part of that journey. 'I am going to fight tooth and nail to be here for as long as I can, to be as successful as I can.'","Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino decided to sack David Hockaday on Saturday after the 4-1 defeat at Watford .
Cellino made a dramatic U-turn keeping Hockaday in charge for now .
Leeds have lost three of their opening four Championship matches so far .
Hockaday is adamant he will stay on as manager and is aiming for the Champions League with Leeds, who reached the semi-final back in 2001 ."

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . Boris Becker was seen having a knock up at the U.S. Open practice court with an extraordinary case of what appeared to be tennis elbow. The former tennis player, who won the Slam himself in 1989, is at the tournament as world number one Novak Djokovic's coach. But it seems the former German star, who won Wimbledon three times in the 1980s, needs to put his racquet down and give his arm a rest. Scroll down for videos . The large bump did not stop the former world number one from going for a knock-up on a practice court . Ouch: The lump looks sore but Becker, who is Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic's coach, carries on . The 46-year-old former world number one was only named as the Serbian's coach last year but the huge lump on his elbow may be a sign he needs a rest. Surprisingly the lump is on his left arm, suggesting the injury may not be tennis-related as he is a right-handed player. However Becker will have to go careful on the double-handed backhands for the time being, especially when facing this year's Wimbledon champion, Djokovic. Fans spotted the lump on Becker's left elbow was he watched the Serbian breeze past Argentine player Diego Schwartzman 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 today. Is that a grimace? Becker's injury may not be tennis-related as it is on his left hand and he is a right-hander . Size of a tennis ball: The lump on Becker's elbow is similarly sized to the balls used at the US Open in New York . But more pictures of the uncomfortable-looking bump appeared later on as photographers watched Becker having a knock-up at the Arthur Ashe stadium court at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York. Djokovic, who said he enjoyed playing in the late evening slot at the Open, next plays Paul-Henri Mathieu. Djokovic and Murray are on course to face each other in the quarter finals should they both reach that stage. Murray laboured to beat Dutchman Robin Haase yesterday over four sets. It is not all work for Becker, however. He was seen relaxing in the Flushing district of Queens, New York yesterday with his wife Lilly. The couple were seen laughing and kissing as Mrs Becker sipped on a glass of wine. Tennis elbow is a condition that causes pain and inflammation around the outside of the elbow. It is caused by the overuse of the muscles of the forearm and lasts between six months and two years. Now that's tennis elbow: Boris Becker was seen with a huge lump on his left elbow at the US Open . Becker imparts some wisdom to world number one Djokovic, who he has been coaching for less than a year .

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . At 19, Bethany Walton tipped the scales at an unhealthy 34st but managed to lose 13st following a NHS-funded gastric sleeve operation in 2006. But after 'stretching' her stomach after being unable to regain control of portion sizes, she piled a third of the weight back on and currently weighs 26st. Now the jobless 27-year-old says she hopes to go under the knife for a second time - and says an anonymous benefactor has stepped forward with the £11,000 cost of a gastric band. Scroll down for video . Second operation: Bethany Walton, 27, is to have a second gastric operation - eight years after her first . Britain's fattest teen: Bethany won the dubious accolade aged 19 when she tipped the scales at 34st . Speaking to Closer magazine, she told of how even as a child, she loved larger portions and hit 6st by the age of five. Her taste for sugary carbs such as pasta and cheese sandwiches made her weight problem worse and by the age of 19, her eating had spiralled out of control. So overweight was Miss Walton, she got breathless while working as a florist and was warned that she might not make it to 30 by doctors. By April 2006, her weight problems had become so bad that she was forced to undergo a gastric sleeve operation to remove three quarters of her stomach. Over two years, she shed 13st and dropped to a size 22. But as her appetite began to increase, the weight began to creep back on. 'Previously a yoghurt or piece of fruit used to fill me up but I started feeling more hungry so ate a little more than normal. 'I soon began to eat bigger portions and before long, I was able to eat a small meal of pie and mash.' Her eating escalated, with Miss Walton rapidly adding chocolate and cheese sandwiches to her menu - despite warnings from doctors. Now, eight years on from her original operation, she says going under the knife for a second time is the only way forward. 'I hated clothes shopping and felt fat and frumpy,' she adds. 'I knew that the only way I could lose weight again was by having surgery because I couldn't control my portion sizes. Food gave me comfort and I couldn't say no to it.' Unhealthy: Bethany, seen here with her mother Julia Barr, weighed 30st by the time she was 13 . Weighty problem: Bethany, now 27, was told she wouldn't see 30 but still finds portion control a challenge . But when she approached her GP, Miss Walton was told that the NHS wouldn't fund any further surgery. Help, however, came in the shape of an anonymous benefactor who came forward with the £11,000 cost of the operation after seeing her on a TV show. Miss Walton, who says she hopes to become a photographer, was overjoyed and will have a gastric bypass and band fitted within the next few months. 'I'm struggling to get a job,' she adds. 'No-one says it's because of my weight but I think it might be, so I hope this op will change things. 'I'd ideally like to get down to 20st and a size 18. I just want to have a happy, healthy life.' Read the full interview in Closer magazine, out now .","Bethany Walton, now 27, weighed an unhealthy 34st by the time she was 19 .

"By . Dan Bloom . and Julian Robinson . Filmmakers have been told they must meet stringent new targets on diversity if they want to win grants from one of Britain's biggest arts bodies. The British Film Institute, which hands out £27million a year, has introduced a 'Three Ticks' system which includes quotas on the number of actors and crew who are female, gay, working-class, disabled or from ethnic minorities. Once the system takes effect in September, budding filmmakers must satisfy at least two out of the three categories before they can be eligible for funds. The BFI has told filmmakers they will have to meet their new diversity targets if they are to receive funding in the future. Its headquarters is pictured in Southbank, London . Despite MPs raising concerns about so-called 'quota' systems in the past, the move was praised by culture minister Ed Vaizey, who said it would 'raise the bar' to make films reflect modern Britain. The BFI, a government body which distributes millions in lottery funds, is now recruiting a 'diversity expert' to ensure its rules are put in place correctly. In advice about its new rules, which it said are obligatory, the BFI gave examples of films which should be seen as models of 'telling diverse stories'. They include Belle, which depicts the struggles of the illegitimate mixed-race daughter of an 18th Century Navy officer, and Gone Too Far, a film about a streetwise teenager on a south London housing estate who meets his long-lost Nigerian brother. The King's Speech, starring Colin Firth, centre and Helena Bonham Carter, right, was backed by funding from the BFI . Another is Pride, a romantic comedy about gay activists in 1984 featuring Bill Nighy. In order to comply with the rules, films must 'tick' at least two out of three categories from 'on-screen diversity', 'off-screen diversity' and 'creating opportunities and promoting social mobility'. On the set, film companies will be asked to ensure 30 per cent of supporting and background characters 'positively reflect' diversity. The British Film Institute wants filmmakers to satisfy at least two out of three of its criteria if they are to win funding for new projects. The government body, which is employing a 'diversity expert' to ensure rules are put in place correctly, has set out its three categories as follows: . 1. On-screen diversity: diverse subject matter, at least one lead character positively reflecting diversity, at least 30 per cent of supporting and background characters positively reflecting diversity . 2. Off-screen diversity: diverse key creatives (director, screenwriter, composer, cinematographer), at least two Heads of Department from diverse backgrounds, production crew and production company staff (both with a range of targets across different diverse groups) 3. Creating opportunities and promoting social mobility: paid internships and employment opportunities for new entrants from diverse backgrounds, training placements for people from diverse backgrounds . In the off-screen category, at least two heads of department would have to be from 'diverse backgrounds'. The . third category requires film-makers to provide 'paid internships and . employment opportunities' and training placements for people from . diverse backgrounds. The . initiative, which the BFI says is backed by UK producers’ association . Pact as well as ethnic minority recruitment and training charity . Creative Access, will be rolled out from September. Last . month, Conservative MP Philip Davies hit out at BBC pledges to ensure . that one in seven actors and presenters will be black, Asian or from . ethinic minorities within the next three years. The BFI also helped to fund the film, Philomena, starring Judi Dench, left, and Steve Coogan, right. Future films will have to tick two out of three new boxes to satisfy new diversity targets . And he told MailOnline today that recruiters should be 'blind' to matters such as religion, race and gender, adding: 'This sort of political correctness is the kind of thing that makes people's blood boil.' But defending the BFI scheme, culture minister Ed Vaizey said: 'This initiative from the BFI should help raise the bar and ensure BFI lottery funded film productions reflect diversity both in front and behind the camera. 'I want to continue to see the TV, film and the performing arts industries actively discussing how they can drive change and improve diversity right across these sectors. 'I hope others will follow the BFI in developing and implementing possible solutions.' BFI chief executive, Amanda Nevill said it was 'vital' that the film industry represented society, to ensure the sector remained 'really relevant'. Gugu Mbatha-Raw arrives for the UK premiere of Belle, in London . The BFI Film Fund is the largest public film fund in the UK, investing more than £27m into film development, production, international sales and distribution, and supporting around30 new film productions each year. But in advice about its new criteria, which it said are obligatory, the body gave examples of films which it now considers should be seen as models of 'telling diverse stories'. They include Belle, which depicts the struggles of the illegitimate mixed-race daughter of an 18th Century Navy officer. The British-made film, released in the UK last month, has made nearly £5.8million at the box office, and starred Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Tom Wilkinson, Miranda Richardson and Matthew Goode. Another example was Gone Too Far, a film about a streetwise teenager on a south London housing estate who meets his long-lost Nigerian brother. The movie, starring Malachi Kirby and Shanika Warren-Markland, explores tensions between wthnic minorities on the estate and premiered at the 2013 BFI London Film Festival. It also singles out Pride, starring Bill Nighy, which charts the lives of gay activists and their attempts to support the miners' strike in a village community in Wales.","New rules issued by British Film Institute, which dishes out £27m a year .

Leicester are waiting to see if they first receive international clearance for new high-profile signing Esteban Cambiasso before making a decision on his availability for Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Arsenal at the King Power Stadium. Former Argentina international Cambiasso signed a one-year deal with City on Thursday after becoming a free agent following his release from Inter Milan after a 10-year spell with the Serie A giants. Veteran: Leicester have added experience to their squad with the capture of Esteban Cambiasso .

The last time Arsenal played Leicester was the 38th and final game of the unbeaten 2003-04 Premier League campaign. Leicester’s players to have featured so far have a combined total of 550 Premier League appearances, fewer than any other team this season. Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez has conceded more fouls (7) without getting booked than any other Premier League player this season. Invincibles: Arsenal's Patrick Vieira scores past Leicester keeper Ian Walker to seal a 2-1 win in the sides' last meeting back in May 2004, which resulted in the Gunners going the 2003-04 campaign unbeaten .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Five nurses who worked at a care home where malnourished pensioners lived on porridge and had pressure sores so deep their bones were exposed have been found guilty of misconduct. The extent of the neglect came to light when five elderly people died in a two-week period at Parkside House Nursing Home in Northampton. A tribunal today found manager Phyllis Johnson and nurses Anastacia Madulu, Girlie Franklin, Maria McKenzie, and Mary Ombui guilty of failing to provide basic care to 10 residents. Nurses Anastacia Madulu, left, and Mary Ombui, right, were found guilty of misconduct at a Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing. The pair, along with their colleagues, failed to provide basic care to 10 patients . Home manager Johnson was also found guilty of failing to report the deaths of three residents to the Care Quality Commission, failing to provide nutritious meals to residents and failing to ensure her staff were adequately trained. Five residents aged between 83 and 100 died at the home between July 22 and August 6, 2009, after being left malnourished, immobile in bed, and with putrid pressure sores. The future of the womens' careers now lie in the hands of the Nursing and Midwifery Council panel who ruled they are guilty of misconduct and their current fitness to practise is impaired. NMC panel chairman Michael Cann said: ‘The panel is of the view that the residents of the home were elderly people, suffering from both mental and physical disabilities and in most cases were also assessed as lacking mental capacity to make decisions regarding their care. ‘Those people were unable to care for themselves, extremely vulnerable and completely reliant on the registered nurses at the home,’ he said. ‘A number of residents were found to be suffering from severe grade four pressure sores which had not been correctly treated and which in some cases were so deep that tendons and/or bones were exposed. ‘They were malnourished, some were dehydrated and lived in a care home that was described as run-down, filthy, and stocked with faulty or inappropriate equipment,’ he said. Nurses Maria McKenzie and Girlie Franklin were among those found guilty of leaving malnourished patients to endure pressure sores so severe their bones were exposed . The panel has heard that in some cases residents had been fed on a diet consisting of little more than porridge. Mr Cann said the ‘appalling condition’ of the pensioners was ‘a direct result of a complete failure of the nursing staff at the home’. ‘The panel heard evidence that the pressure sores suffered by the residents were either preventable or should not have progressed to the extreme state had they been provided with adequate care or nourishment,’ he added. Concerns about Parkside House were first raised when an elderly woman was admitted to Northampton General Hospital on July 21, 2009 with severe pressure sores on her heels exposing her bones and tendons. She was unresponsive and died the following day, exhibiting signs of dehydration and malnourishment. Parkside House Nursing Home in Northampton where the nurses found guilty of misconduct left patients with bed sores so severe their bones were exposed . Another resident with severe pressure sores died on the same day at the home, while three people were shipped out of the home over fears for their health. The third vulnerable pensioner died in a community hospital on July 28 while two died in separate care homes on August 4 and 6. A serious case review into the deaths found the ‘causes considered to be consistent with the effects of severe neglect’. Two other Parkside House nurses, Alice Nojozi and Nobuhle Moyo, were let off with cautions following earlier NMC hearings. The tribunal continues with the panel set to decide if any or all of the nurses should be struck off the register.","Five nurses guilty of misconduct rules Nursing and Midwifery Council .

"By . Ian Parker, Press Association . Leicester manager Nigel Pearson is confident big-name signing Esteban Cambiasso will not upset the team harmony he has worked hard to nurture during his time at the club. The Foxes pulled off a surprise transfer coup this week in attracting former Argentina international Cambiasso to the King Power Stadium. Cambiasso has made clear, even at the age of 34 and after winning numerous trophies during his previous 10 years with Inter Milan prior to his release this summer, he is eager to make history with City. VIDEO Scroll down for Nigel Pearson: Leicester have already missed out on a few signings . Star signing: Leicester completed the signing of Esteban Cambiasso on Thursday . Harmony: Leicester boss Nigel Pearson does not believe Cambiasso's arrival will affect team harmony . BORN: Argentina, August 18 1980 (age 34) Playing position: Central midfielder . 1998-2001: Independiente (98 apps, 14 gls) 2001-2002: River Plate (37, 12) 2002-2004: Real Madrid (41, 0) 2004-2014: Inter Milan (315, 41) 2000-2011: Argentina (52, 5) But, as has been witnessed at numerous clubs in the past, such a stellar acquisition can often have an unsettling effect on those around them. Pearson, however, has no doubt about the type of player and character Cambiasso is, especially after seeing how well he was received by his new team-mates on Friday. 'He's been welcomed into the group, as you would expect him to be,' Pearson said of the 52-times capped international. 'The players have been quite excited about the prospect of having somebody of that stature in the game being alongside them. 'But Esteban will view himself as one of the players, one of the squad, which is a very positive thing.' Pearson also believes Cambiasso will be able to teach him a trick or two given the player's 'world-wide experience'. 'I, like anybody, have a capacity to keep learning,' Pearson added. 'Certainly if somebody comes with the wealth of experience he has, I will probably - if I've an open enough mind - continue to learn from people like him. 'I don't see that as being anything other than positive. Managers learn as much from players, as players do from managers and coaches. 'I've always had that sort of view, and hopefully I'll continue to learn from my players as well.' Whether Cambiasso makes his debut in Sunday's home game with Arsenal depends on whether he receives international clearance. Done deal: Cambiasso had been locked in talks with Leicester after leaving Inter Milan over the summer . The clash with the Gunners continues City's tough run of fixtures to start their return to the Barclays Premier League following a 2-2 home draw with Everton and 2-0 defeat at Chelsea. Pearson has told his players what he expects. 'It is another big game against one of the most successful sides of the modern era in English football,' he said. 'They are a side that has an exceptionally good blueprint as to how a football club should be run. 'But our philosophy is we have to play to our strengths, without being naive or gung-ho. 'We have to be ruthless in both penalty boxes to get the better of the top sides.' Pearson is hopeful of attracting two more players to the club before the transfer window closes at 11pm on Monday. Premier League bound: The move sees Cambiasso make his mark in England for the first time in his career . One of those appears to be QPR defender Danny Simpson, with the other Lokomotiv Moscow striker Dame N'Doye. 'We'll try and get two more players,' Pearson said. 'If we can do that, fine. If we can't then, as I've said in the past, I'm happy with the players I have. 'It's more out of our desire to have a strong enough squad to go from window to window. 'It's not that I don't have faith in the players I have. You know I do - I speak about it all the time. 'I'm very proud of what this group of players have achieved to get here.' Aside from the prospect of Cambiasso making his debut, Pearson has midfielders Marc Albrighton and Danny Drinkwater and striker Jamie Vardy available again following injuries, but midfielder Matty James (shin) and defender Matthew Upson (foot) are definitely out.

"By . Jonathan Veal, Press Association . Nottingham Forest came through their toughest test of the season so far with their unbeaten start intact as they beat a spirited Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 at Hillsborough. Forest, among the favourites for promotion, are enjoying a fine start to life under Stuart Pearce and Henri Lansbury's first-half header made it four Sky Bet Championship wins from five and puts them top of the early league table. But this victory was by no means plain sailing as they were given a stern challenge by a Wednesday side who saw their own unbeaten start to the campaign end. Match winner: Henri Lansbury's 37th-minute goal proved decisive as Forest claimed all three points . Celebration: Lansbury is congratulated by former Sheffield Wednesday winger Michail Antonio . Sheffield Wednesday: Westwood, Lees, Loovens, Mattock (Hope 85), Palmer, Maguire (Helan 79), Semedo (Madine 64), Coke, Maghoma, Nuhiu, May. Subs not used: Kirkland, McCabe, Zayatte, Corry. Booked: Palmer, Mattock, Semedo, Loovens. Nottingham Forest: Darlow, Hunt, Mancienne, Hobbs (Lascelles 73), Lichaj, Burke, Cohen, Antonio (Fryatt 79), Reid, Assombalonga, Lansbury (Tesche 68). Subs not used: De Vries, Fox, Veldwjik, Osborn. Booked: Burke, Assombalonga, Antonio. Goal: Lansbury 37 . After Lansbury's strike eight minutes before half-time, the Owls put up a sterling rally in a bid to get back into the game, with Stevie May going close three times and Forest goalkeeper Karl Darlow producing fine saves to deny Chris Maguire and Atdhe Nuhiu. But they could not make the breakthrough they deserved and succumbed to a first defeat, although on this showing Stuart Gray's men will not be embroiled in the relegation fights of the last two years and could be play-off candidates. The confidence running through both sides owing to their respective impressive starts was evident from the off and both attacked with early intent. A fine piece of defending from Michael Mancienne denied Wednesday striker May a tap-in as the former Chelsea man desperately intercepted Liam Palmer's cut-back while the ever-dangerous Britt Assombalonga tested Keiren Westwood with a low drive for Forest. It continued to be an open game as Wednesday went close through Jacques Maghoma's testing effort which forced Darlow into a good low save, while at the other end Assombalonga looked every inch the £5million striker as he caused the hosts' defence endless problems. However, the former Peterborough man was not involved as Forest forged into a 37th-minute lead, which was reward for a sustained spell of pressure. Instead it was former Wednesday winger Michail Antonio who was at the heart of the action as his teasing ball was guided home by the head of Lansbury. Provider: Nottingham Forest winger Antonio set up Lansbury to score the winning goal at Hillsborough . Battling for the ball: Sheffield Wednesday's Jeremy Helan is challenged by Chris Burke of Nottingham Forest . Wednesday's response was almost immediate as Maguire dragged a shot wide from the edge of the box when he had time to compose himself. The Owls fightback was more vigorous after the break as they searched for a leveller with May having three efforts in quick succession, two saved by Darlow and one was dragged wide. Forest's goal was coming under siege and Darlow pulled out a fine stretching save to deny Maguire while Jack Hunt and Mancienne defiantly blocked efforts in a mad scramble. Pearce's men had to survive a late onslaught as Darlow superbly tipped over from Nuhiu's curler before another scramble was desperately cleared away. But they held on and headed away from Hillsborough with the points in the bag and looking definite promotion material. Happy man: Stuart Pearce will be delighted with his side's result against Sheffield Wednesday .

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . Uber sneaky: The ride-sharing company Uber allegedly has been trying to undermine its rival Lyft by stealing away its drivers . The ride-sharing service Uber has been allegedly poaching drivers from its main rival Lyft with the help of 'brand ambassadors' armed with burner phones and credit cards, according to newly released documents. Founded in San Francisco in 2009, Uber uses a mobile application to connect riders with vehicles for hire. The start-up’s chief competitor, Lyft, came onto the scene in 2012, offering similar services via its peer-to-peer ride-sharing app. On Tuesday, the technology website The Verge released an exclusive report outlining how Uber has been chipping away at Lyft’s market share through its so-called Operation SLOG, which so far has resulted in thousands of canceled rides for the two-year-old start-up. According to the report, Uber has employed independent contractors dubbed 'brand ambassadors' to hire Lyft cars using disposable phones and company credit cards in order to recruit their rival's drivers. Uber has vehemently denied trying to sabotage their chief competitor, which has been expanding its business nationwide. 'Lyft's claims against Uber are baseless and simply untrue,' the ride-sharing company told The Verge. Uber also has denied claims made by Lyft that its employees have deliberately ordered and then canceled some 5,500 Lyft rides, costing the company’s staff both time and money. But an unnamed contractor working for Uber told The Verge that his employers are 'flat-out lying' to their customers, the media and their investors about their concerted efforts aimed at disrupting their competitors in the cutthroat ride-sharing business. Speaking to The Verge, the Uber employee laid out the company's secret strategy designed to poach drivers from its opponent. According to the source, Uber's 'brand ambassadors' would order Lyft rides using Uber-supplied burner phones and credit cards, chat up the drivers and try to convince them to sign up with Uber before reaching their destination. A brand ambassador could earn up to $750 for recruiting each new driver, the Uber contractor revealed to the technology website. Ahead of Lyft's introduction of its ride-sharing service in New York last month, Uber went to work building 'street teams' made up of brand ambassadors who were given instructions to gather information about the completion’s plans and to siphon away its drivers. Scroll down for video . New kid on the block: Lyft came onto the scene in 2012, offering services similar to Uber's via its peer-to-peer ride-sharing app . An email sent by Uber managers to their independent contractors outlined the recruitment process, beginning with hiring a Lyft car using a burner iPhone. The Uber agents posing as regular passengers were then supposed to engage the Lyft driver in small talk, asking him or her about their history with Lyft. 'After assessing driver for openness to Uber, ask them if they’d consider joining Uber,' the directive stated. The brand ambassadors were coached to entice potential recruits with promises of higher trip volume, ‘more polished clientele,’ and newer vehicles. The ideal outcome of the in-ride exchange was signing up the driver with Uber on the spot. In order to avoid redundancy and minimize the risk of being detected by Lyft, Uber created a private group on the messaging app GroupMe where brand ambassadors could share profiles of Lyft employees each of them had approached, The Verge reported. According to information obtained by the site, Operation SLOG has been put in place in at least 10 cities around the country, including Los Angeles, Miami and Boston. Drivers are allowed to pick up passengers for both Uber and Lyft, but the practice is frowned upon by the companies. The end justifies the means:  An Uber contractor revealed that the company has been using 'brand ambassadors' to hire Lyft cars in order to chat up the drivers and poach them away from the competitor . Motorists who switch their allegiance from one ride-sharing business to the other are rewarded with perks and bonuses. In response to the allegations detailed in The Verge piece, Uber posted a blog entry Tuesday downplaying the sabotage claims related to its driver-recruitment program called Operation SLOG, which stands for 'Supplying Long-Term Operations Growth.' 'There’s been a lot of discussion – and a lot of misinformation – about Uber’s driver recruitment and the ridesharing industry’s at large,' the post read. 'We’d like to set the record straight and demystify our recruiting efforts.' Speaking to NBC News, an Uber spokesperson went to far as to call the claims in The Verge article ‘patently false,’ but acknowledged the existence of a systematic recruitment of Lyft drivers. ‘We can't successfully recruit drivers without talking to them, and that means taking a ride,’ the Uber representative said. In its blog post, Uber described ride-sharing as a ‘noisy marketplace’ and suggested that its aggressive recruitment efforts are necessary to ‘cut through the noise to market to potential partners.’","Technology website The Verge obtained emails and documents outlining Uber's plan to siphon away drivers from Lyft .

Aston Villa never recovered after an early brace from Groningen attacker Tjarron Chery put the hosts 2-0 up inside seven minutes in their pre-season friendly at Euroborg, with the Dutch side going on to win 4-1. Paul Lambert's side, fresh from a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Chesterfield on July 30, put in a disappointing performance against their Eredivisie opponents, as they created very little going forward and rarely threatened the Groningen goal. Jarchinio Antonia and Dino Islamovic scored the home side's third and fourth goals, either side of a thumping Charles N'Zogbia free-kick in the 76th minute.

The former Newcastle shot-stopper's poor clearance fell straight to Chery and he made no mistake with his finish. Three minutes later Groningen's N0 10 doubled his side's advantage with a thunderbolt into the top corner from 30 yards. Given, on this occasion, could do nothing about the goal. The hosts continued to dominate proceedings at Euroborg, and shortly after the half-hour mark, Antonio tapping in from a close-range after a driving run down the wing from Danny Hoesen. Three down at the break, Lambert resisted making changes until midway through the second half. Instructions: Lambert's assistant Roy Keane urges his team on during a brief water break at Euroborg .

Charles N'Zogbia was one of those introduced, and the Frenchman soon left his stamp on the game with an emphatic free-kick in the 76th minute. Leandro Bacuna, another of Villa's second-half substitutes, was given a standing ovation by the Groningen fans having played for them for four years between 2009-2013. Despite Nzogbia's thunderous set piece, Villa continued to look short of ideas going forward, and the Frenchman was at fault for Groningen's fourth and final goal in added time at the end of the game, as he gave away possession cheaply, allowing Islamovic to sneak in and slot the ball under Given.","Groningen attacker Tjarron Chery scored twice in the opening 10 minutes .

It took them a little while to settle, with Dynamo captain Brad Davis firing wide after 19 minutes, but thereafter Villa were in the ascendancy. Fabian Delph dragged a shot wide after 27 minutes after a penetrating run from the heart of midfield, before Bennett headed over a minute later. Delph picked up a knock, however, and was withdrawn for Kieran Richardson as a precaution just after the half-hour mark. Karim El Ahmadi came close to giving Villa the lead with a well-struck 25 yard effort that swerved in the air and caused problems for goalkeeper Tyler Deric. But Lambert's men would not have to wait too much longer for a lead, as Bennett rose highest at the back post to score. Villa, who made wholesale changes at the break, picked up where they left off after the break, with Darren Bent wasting a couple of decent opportunities. Alan Hutton jumped to meet an Ashley Westwood free-kick 10 minutes into the second period, but Deric was equal to it.

Lambert was pleased with how his side coped in very warm conditions to end their American tour on a high. 'It was hard in this game because of the heat. It's very hard to play in,' he told Aston Villa's official website. 'But I was delighted with them again. It was really, really pleasing in these conditions.

"By . Sami Mokbel . Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM . John Terry came off the bench to score as Chelsea got their pre-season schedule off to a winning start over Wycombe. The Chelsea skipper slotted home his side's third of the night as the Blues - who were without their two big summer signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas - cruised to a comfortable 5-0 win.

Touch of class: Bamford provides the finish for his goal and Chelsea's opener . As you'd expect the encounter, Chelsea's first of pre-season, got off to a lethargic start. Marco van Ginkel, who is now fully fit following last season's anterior cruciate ligament injury looked impressive in central midfield alongside Oriol Romeu during the opening exchanges. The first real opening arrived in the 20th minute and it lead to Chelsea taking the lead when Ake's strong run and cross down the left resulted in Bamford sweeping home from 12 yards. Todd Kane's night came to an end just a minute after the goal as he hobbled off with a groin injury to be replaced by Kurt Zouma - the 19-year-old defender signed from St Etienne for £12million in January.

Mourinho made a raft of changes at half time; senior players Terry, Nemanja Matic, Branislav Ivanovic and Mohamed Salah all coming on. But it was the Chelsea's young guns who combined again to give the west Londoners a two goal advantage three minutes after the restart.

"By . Wally Downes Jr . Captain fantastic John Terry spared Jose Mourinho's blushes after earning Chelsea a 3-2 win - with two goals - against League Two minnows AFC Wimbledon. The Premier League side was two down with 16 minutes to go - after being roughed up by 16st powerhouse Ade 'The Beast' Akinfenwa and outrun by the hungry stars of the 12-year-old football club. But the half-time introduction of Terry and Branislav Invanovic turned around their fortunes and helped them to triumph.

Subs not used: Boga . The Blues were undone by an Alan Bennett header inside 40 seconds before Matt Tubbs crashed a penalty past Mark Schwarzer. Terry pulled one back for his side and Mohamed Salah levelled things up with seven minutes left on the clock. Only for Terry to grab the glory - after a summer spent on holiday instead of at the World Cup – and help his side keep face. The opener stunned the travelling fans at Kingsmeadow. Chelsea conceded a harmless looking early corner but when George Framcomb whipped it in and Bennett out-jumped the Premier League side's defence Chelsea were stunned. The visitors had plenty of the ball for the remainder of the first-half but it was largely passed along the back-four and occasionally lent to midfielder anchorman Nemanja Matric who all-too-often played it safe or sidewards. AFC then produced another shock when they doubled the lead with six minutes of the half left. An ideally lofted pass into Tubbs allowed the tireless forward to control the ball and cut across Kurt Zouma in one movement that left the centre-back perplexed. Down went Tubbs and Zouma should have got his marching orders as he was clearly the last man but no cards were shown, clearly due to the games 'friendly' status. The only thing Chelsea fans had to smile about, based on Saturday's performance, was their occasional witty song about Akinfenwa's hulking figure.

But the man labelled the 'strongest man in English football' due to his ability to benchpress 180kg – almost twice his bodyweight - looked like he was well on his way having the last laugh. Time after time he rolled defenders, shook off challenges and shrugged off the attentions of Chelsea's million-pound men before he was withdrawn on 66 minutes with his side in charge. Chelsea's first good chance of the match didn't arrived until the 44th minute when Nathan Ake, playing at left-back, surged forward into oodles of space but his effort was poor and gifted Wimbledon another goal-kick. Chelsea rung the changes at half-time and Ivanovic should have scored when he was found at the back post, with a lofted pass, but he was caught between a header and volley and let the ball drift out.

Substitute Izzy Brown was then left unmarked to take aim at James Shea's goal with an easy header but it was straight at the grateful keeper. Wimbledon's dogged defence could not hold out forever and was finally breached by the Chelsea skipper on 74 minutes when he arrived late at the back-post and poked home. Mourinho's men finally found some momentum and were soon level. The Egyptian Salah picked up a pass from deep meandered through the Dons' defence and rifled home to hurt the depleted Dons . And, with the home side all out of gas, it was down to Terry to rise to the occasion. With seconds left he jumped above the shattered Dons players to nod home at the front post and crush the Wimbledon dream.","Terry came off the bench at half-time to score twice .

The home side's lead lasted until half-time, but Fabregas and Costa combined to prove why the club paid so much money for them early in the second period.

Keep an eye on the site for more of the same as Chelsea and the rest of the big clubs prepare for the big Premier League kick off next month. 'It was pretty physical because they've started the season already so we had to work even harder. 'Today I think I was good and I got a goal. I started near the half time and played a good one-two with Iva (Branislav Ivanovic) and it's a decent finish.' 'To play 90 minutes for the first time is demanding but I've been working hard towards fitness. 'The shoulder is good - if we didn't know that I'm safe to play I wouldn't but we made the decision to go ahead.' It ends 1-1 in Klagenfurt. Jeremie Boga superb equaliser cancels out Silvio de Oliviera's opener that may or not have crossed the line. Three minutes of added time. Looks like this is going to end a draw. 89 mins: Pellets make two substitutes with a minute left...is this time wasting in a pre season friendly?! Here's a Vine of Jeremie Boga's equaliser: . 85 mins: Boga looks on fire. This time he hits a free kick which skims off the top of the small and out for a corner. He's only 17, you know. 83 mins: Wonderful play from Jeremie Boga - he goes on a great run through and even despite losing balance he finishes brilliantly into the bottom left hand corner. 80 mins: Another substitute from Mourinho, Nathaniel Chalobah replaces Nemanja Matic deep in midfield. 78 mins: Talk of the devil...Ivanovic has gone up front. Also, a sub: Andreas Christensen comes on for Izzy Brown. 77 mins: Chelsea threw Branislav Ivanovic up front at the weekend and now it's John Terry's turn to make some advancing runs. The Chelea skipper wins a corner after finding his way into the penalty area, but the dead ball is wasted. 69 mins: Cech won't be giving up his No 1 shirt for Thibaut Courtois without a fight - here he makes a good reaction save and tips the ball over the bar from a close range header from de Oliviera to keep the score at 1-0. 67 mins: Chelsea have won a series of corners but they're still not creating a huge amount and Petr Cech has to beat away a strike from range as Pellets try to counter. 59 mins: Bamford, Luis and Van Ginkel come off for Dominic Solanke, Oriol Romeu and Nathan Ake . 55 mins: A cross gets knocked back across the box and it comes to Silvio de Oliviera whose shot comes off Petr Cech and hits the bar. It's deemed to be over the line by the linesman after some protests and the Austrians lead. 49 mins: Kurt Zouma shows off his reckless side. He gave away a penalty against Wimbledon at the weekend and now he goes in for a big challenge on the right hand touchline but takes all of the man and none of the ball. Off we go again in Klagenfurt as the referee gets us underway. Jeremie Boga is coming on for Lewis Baker. Good news: Marco van Ginkel has looked excellent in midfield for Chelsea - sharp passing, snappy challenges and generally looking very impressive. A quick screenshot of one of those big tackles is on show below... Bad news: This game is fairly dire. Chelsea haven't created any clear cut chances and when they have had a sight of goal it's been wasted with Pellets 'keeper Alexander Kofner only having to make easy saves so far. Where are Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa when you need them? Half time whistle goes in Klagenfurt and it's 0-0. Jose Mourinho will no doubt ring the changes at the break. 34 mins: Patrick Bamford does really well to hold off a defender and puts Izzy Brown, but the 17-year-old can't convert and his shot hits the 'keeper. 27 mins: Salah goes down in the area looking for a penalty under Rene Seebacher's challenge but he went down easily and it's certainly not a spot kick. Easy decision for the referee. 'Crowd bored here already at the Worthersee Stadion. The Mexican waves have begun.' 22 mins: Best chance of the half. Izzy Brown's ball comes to Mo Salah on the edge of the box and he goes for it first time - doesn't connect well enough though. It's tame and well saved. 21 mins: Pellets try to launch a counter attack down their right hand side but Filipe Luis shows he'll be a solid option for Chelsea on the left by dealing with it well. It's not the most exciting game so far - the crowd in Klagenfurt are already onto the Mexican waves... 15 mins: Patrick Bamford runs onto a ball from Nemanja Matic but he's too far wide really to shoot, but he gambles from a tight angle and hits the side netting. 12 min: Mo Salah dinks a ball over the top for Baker but it's slightly too long for him and he can't wrap his boot around it to knock it across the box. 11 mins: Marco van Ginkel is keen to impress... He's threw himself into a few big tackles so far. No holding back which is perhaps surprisingly for someone who spent most of last season out with injury. Mo Salah, by the way, has changed shirt number. He's switched from sporting the No 15 shirt to No 17. That former, of course, was Didier Drogba's number when he first joined Chelsea. Is Salah leaving it open for the legendary centre forward's return? 8 mins: Good chance for Chelsea as Baker makes a run down the right flank and plays the ball to Patrick Bamford - he slips it through for Mo Salah but the Egyptian (now not off to join the military) gets tackled as he hesitates on the edge of the area. 6 mins: Bit of a slow start here with no real chances but Lewis Baker has the first shot on target with a free kick - well struck but easily saved by the goalkeeper. And we're off, Chelsea are in all blue tonight with white socks after sporting their yellow strip against Wycombe and Wimbledon. Strong starting line-up from Chelsea there - even if Jose Mourinho is yet to trust his World Cup players with the chance to come back into the side. Diego Costa, Gary Cahill, Fernando Torres and Cesc Fabregas all crashed out of the group stage and are all left out. Filipe Luis does get a start though - he had the summer off after not being picked by Brazil, so it will be the first chance to see him in a Chelsea shirt. Hopefully we'll be seeing something like this: . Chelsea subs: Mitchell Beeney, Matej Delac, Nathan Ake, Oriol Romeu, Nathaniel Chalobah, Andreas Christensen, John Swift, Jeremie Boga, Dominic Solanke. Here's tonight's starting line up for Chelsea: . Starting XI: Petr Cech, Branislav Ivanovic, Kurt Zouma, John Terry, Felipe Luis, Marco Van Ginkel, Nemanja Matic, Mo Salah, Lewis Baker, Izzy Brown, Patrick Bamford. So, Cech returns to the side after recovering from the dislocated shoulder he suffered in last season's Champions League semi final against Atletico Madrid.

Hull's players had already talked of winning the Europa League in Warsaw next May but they were staring at a nightmare until substitute Aluko pounced to volley home from six yards in the 80th minute. The goal keeps alive the dream of facing the likes of Inter Milan at the KC Stadium this season. To give their journey some perspective, exactly 10 years ago last night Hull were playing Bournemouth in League One. They won 1-0. Go back 15 years and they were getting beat 1-0 at Exeter City in England's bottom tier. Bruce handed a full debut to £6million signing Robert Snodgrass as he attempted to inject some energy following a sluggish showing during the goalless draw in Zilna last week. Trencin signalled their intention from the off when Haris Hajradinovic attempted to lob Allan McGregor from kick-off, the Scottish goalkeeper panicked enough to scramble before gathering. Battle: Shane Long fights for possession with Peter Cogley at the KC Stadium . But there was nothing he could do to prevent Trencin's shock opener just 90 seconds later as Frantisek Kubik escaped down the right and drew back for Tomas Malec to apply a measured finish. The visitors threatened to double their advantage when a well-worked free-kick landed at the feet of Jakub Holubek and he stung the palms of McGregor with a vicious strike from 20 yards. Hull should have been level when Shane Long broke free on 15 minutes but his dink was read by Milos Volesak and the stopper spread his frame to block. Long, though, was guilty of a glaring miss soon after when Snodgrass screwed a shot in to his unmarked feet on the edge of the six-yard box. First he stabbed tamely at Volesak before swiping at fresh air when the ball rebounded. It was an embarrassing passage which left the forward on the floor, face hidden in shame. Proving his worth: New signing Jake Livermore storms through midfield with the ball . But the KC crowd – and Long – exhaled a collective relief just moments later when Robbie Brady loaded a cross from the left and Ahmed Elmohamady rose to power a header into the bottom corner. Long was enduring a miserable night and he somehow headed straight at nemesis Volesak when a corner was deflected onto his brow just four yards from goal. Liam Rosenior was introduced after half-time and his first touch – a 25-yard drive – very nearly nestled in the top corner and Tom Huddlestone lashed narrowly over on 73 minutes. The home side continued to press and their prayers were answered when Aluko connected with Snodgrass' knock-down just yards from goal.","Aluko nets winner with ten minutes remaining at KC Stadium .

"By . Charlie Scott . Follow @@charliefscott . David Nugent's prolific pre-season continued as Leicester City swatted MK Dons aside on Monday evening, recording a comfortable 2-0 win with goals coming either side of the break. Nugent, a one-time England international, put the visitors ahead at Stadium mk with a deflected effort from distance, and James Pearson, son of Leicester boss Nigel, increased their lead with a stonking strike into the top corner from 30 yards in the second half. Leicester have now won four and drawn one during their run of pre-season games, as they prepare to play in the Premier League for the first time in a decade. The difference: Leicester goalscorer David Nugent, right, hassles Dele Alli in possession during the match . Nugent was at the heart of everything good about Leicester's play at Stadium mk. The former Portsmouth striker netted the opening goal of the game, provided the assist for Pearson's stunning second-half effort, and was handful for MK Dons' defence throughout. As early as the fifth minute Nugent was causing problems, dropping deep before threading a pass out to Riyad Mahrez, whose cross then found Jeff Schlupp on the left. Only a decent stop from David Martin kept the score level. MK Dons: Martin; Hodson (Baldock 74), Lewington (Tilney 74), McFadzean (Hickford 84), Kay (Tingey 84); Alli (Randall 69), Potter (Trialist A 69); Green, Bowditch (Powell 46), Reeves (Hitchcock 53); Afobe (Trialist B 69). Subs not used: McLoughlin, Burns, Flanagan, Summerfield, Rasulo. Leicester: Hamer, Pearson (McCourt 72), Morgan, Kennedy (Sesay 79), Hammond, King, Albrighton, Schlupp, Mahrez (Barmby 75), Wood, Nugent. Subs not used: Logan, Cain, Blyth, Panyiotou. Goals: Nugent 23, Pearson 67. Attendance: 4,332. Not long after Leicester thought they were ahead when Chris Wood bundled home from close-range after Nugent had flicked an enticing cross from Marc Albrighton into his path. Despite the New Zealand striker's appeals the goal was chalked off, with Wood adjudged to have fouled goalkeeper Martin in the build-up. Midway through the first half Pearson's side were deservedly in front. Nugent, with his back to goal, swiveled on to his left and let fly from 30 yards, the ball bouncing into the back of the net courtesy of a generous deflection. Leicester continued to pepper the goal of their former player Martin, and the Dons' goalkeeper had to be alert to keep out efforts from Wood and Mahrez in quick succession. The hosts began to force the issue as the half progressed. Their exciting academy product Dele Alli fired an effort against the post in the 43rd minute, and seconds later put Arsenal loanee Benik Afobe through on goal, but Ben Hamer saved well. Dons completed the loan signing of Afobe earlier on Monday, and there were encouraging signs for the club's fans as he and Alli struck up an immediate understanding going forward. The home side started the second half stronger, with Afobe's pace pinning Leicester's defence back. Good impression: Benik Afobe, right, played well on his MK Dons debut after joining from Arsenal on loan . In the 58th minute Afobe wasted their best chance of the game, when his touch let him down inside the area following a decent cross from Danny Green. Only a goal-line clearance from Andy King stopped Afobe levelling the scores shortly after the hour mark, the Leicester midfielder hoofing the ball away from danger after the 21-year-old forward had shot at goal following a Green corner. Despite MK Dons' dominance after the break it was Leicester that grabbed the second goal of the game - and what a goal it was. That man Nugent's cross from the left was cleared only as far as Pearson. The right-back needed just a single touch to set himself, before hammering a shot into the top corner from 30 yards that prompted applause from both sets of supporters. Five minutes later he departed to a standing ovation from the Foxes fans. Dons introduced a couple of trialists late on, with Trialist A firing just over and then clearing off his own line within the space of a minute. Rotherham and Werder Bremen are next up for the Foxes, before they start their Premier League campaign against Everton on August 16.","Former England international scored midway through the first half, his fourth goal in pre-season for the Foxes .

Liam Moore's expertly taken volley gave the Premier League side the lead, but Phil Brown's side levelled things up in the second half when Tom Clarke nodded home from close range. After a cagey opening 25 minutes the game suddenly came to live when Moore gave the Foxes the lead from an excellent move. Clinical: Liam Moore and Tom Clarke celebrate scoring for their respective sides .

The League One side went close to getting themselves back into the game on 40 minutes with Moore again heavily involved as he made a crucial block from veteran striker Kevin Davies' shot. Preston continued to apply pressure after the interval and eventually got a deserved equaliser on 57 minutes. Clarke rose highest in the area to level the scoreline, as they looked to preserve their four-match unbeaten run. The Foxes were fortunate not to be 2-1 down just a minute later when Kasper Schmeichel came to the rescue to palm away John Welsh's effort.

"By . Dominic King . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . So, they have missed out on the first piece of silverware of the year. A last minute goal, scruffily conceded from a set piece, would suggest Brendan Rodgers was left tearing his hair out on a sultry night in Boston. If anything, the opposite was true. Liverpool's manager will not be losing any sleep after Daniel Agger's late own goal clinched the grandly-named Buick Trophy for Roma and for good reason. Liverpool's squad took a step closer to full fitness and a classy performance from Philippe Coutinho augers well for the future.

If there was concern for Rodgers from . the game, it was the shoulder injury to Fabio Borini that curtailed his . night after just nine minutes but, that apart, this was just the kind of . work out Liverpool were looking for. And, with key performers such as . Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana to slot in - plus the . imminent arrival of Loic Remy to provide more forward options - it was . no surprise to see Rodgers make the post match lap of the pitch sporting . a relaxed smile. Results do . not matter at this stage of the campaign, it is about making sure . preparations go smoothly and since they have been in the United States, . Liverpool's have gone like clockwork.

"By . John Drayton . Newcastle strolled to a 4-0 victory against Sydney FC on Tuesday as Alan Pardew's new signings were given the chance to impress in New Zealand. Siem de Jong gave the Magpies an early lead as the Dutchman pounced on a mistake from Sydney goalkeeper Ivan Necevski to rob him of the ball before slotting home for his second pre-season goal of the summer. Shortly afterwards, Newcastle new boy Emmanuel Riviere scored on his non-competitive Newcastle debut after putting the finishing touch to a Yoan Gouffran cross.

Newcastle defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa even fancied his chances as the right-back let rip from 20-yards to find the net courtesy of a fairly hefty deflection. It was a good workout for Alan Pardew's side in the chill of Dunedin as Sydney began to put up more of a fight in the second half while the string of substitutes took the flow out of the game. It took until the 82nd minute for Newcastle to grab their fourth when substitute Adam Armstrong slotted past the Sydney goalkeeper.

"By . Oliver Todd . Follow @@oliver_todd . Just as it looked like Alvaro Negredo's luck was turning, disaster struck. 'The Beast' brilliantly created Scott Sinclair's opener against Hearts but minutes later he was leaving the field with a limp. And it looked as if things were to get worse for City when Osman Sow equalised in the second half for the recently relegated Edinburgh side - before Aleksandar Kolarov's penalty 10 minutes from time gave the Blues their first win of their Scottish pre season tour. Negredo made a blistering start to his City career last season before fading away at the end of the campaign - and while fans will have been delighted to see him play a brilliant eye-of-the-needle assist for Sinclair to score, his early exit could be a worry with less than a month until the start of the season.

Attendance: 12,118 . Manuel Pellegrini played different teams . in each half as the Premier League champions looked to build up their . fitness ahead of a tough defence of their title. Summer signings Fernando and Willy Caballero both made their second appearances of the summer as half time substitutes on a night when City's stars who did not travel to the World Cup enjoyed a run out. Hearts engineered the first real opening after 19 minutes when Jamie Walker threaded a pass through to Dale Carrick in the box but the striker's left-footed strike from a tight angle was repelled by goalkeeper Richard Wright. City were not so forgiving in the final third and Pellegrini's side went ahead after 25 minutes. Negredo . found Sinclair in the box and the midfielder kept his calm amid shouts . for offside to cooly roll the ball pass Alexander from close range.

With the exception of the goal scorer, City named a completely different line-up after the break.

City were awarded a penalty with ten minutes left when Callum Paterson brought down Emyr Huws after taking a bad first touch. Kolarov - roundly booed after criticising Paterson for a challenge on keeper Caballero - silenced the home crowd with a clinical low finish.

"By . Chris Wheeler . So there will be no Manchester derby in Miami after all following the second penalty shootout defeat to befall Manuel Pellegrini and his Premier League champions in the space of four days. They did not seem particularly upset about that as the squad flew out of Minneapolis in the early hours of Sunday morning and headed for Manchester instead of Florida where neighbours United will now face Liverpool on Monday night. With the remainder of his World Cup contingent due to report back at the start of the week and Frank Lampard arriving on Wednesday, Pellegrini was just grateful there were no injuries on a pitch he had described as ‘high risk’ beforehand. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pellegrini talk about Manchester City's Premier League rivals . Blow: Manchester City drew 2-2 with Olympiacos in Minneapolis but were defeated 5-4 on penalties . Shot stopper: Roberto Jimenez Gago was the hero for the Greek side in the shootout . Big win: The Greek contingent in the United States grapple for a shirt of their heroes . Opponents . Olympiacos had even refused to train on the temporary grass surface at . the University of Minnesota’s TCF Bank Stadium and the game only went . ahead after urgent talks on Friday night. It passed off without any . problem after the surface was heavily sanded and watered overnight and . then touched up with painted green. City . twice went ahead through Stevan Jovetic’s fifth goal in three games on . tour and an Aleksandar Kolarov penalty only to pegged back on both . occasions – just as they had been by Liverpool at Yankee Stadium on . Wednesday – as Dimitrios Diamantakos claimed both goals for the Greeks. Joe . Hart’s unconventional save with his foot from Avraam Papadopoulos sent . the shootout to sudden-death after James Milner and Scott Sinclair both . saw their attempts saved, but Micah Richards blasted wildly over with . what may prove to be his last kick for City and Anastasios Papazoglou . wrapped up victory. At . least Pellegrini now has two more days at home to prepare for next . weekend’s Community Shield against Arsenal. ‘I said the pitch was a high . risk but they worked hard on it to improve it and fortunately nothing . happened,’ he said. Hope: Joe Hart did make a fine save with his leg during the penalty shootout . Teamwork: Stevan Jovetic is congratulated by Edin Dzeko after he put Manchester City in front on Saturday . ‘The . tour has been extremely useful and the team have been professional. We’ve had some great performances but the condition of the pitches . condition has hindered us. ‘The . positive of these few games has been the quality of the games and the . levels my players reached. The negative will be the travelling . distances. ‘We are not ready for the new season yet because the rest of our squad are only coming back on Monday.’ Jovetic . fired City ahead in the 35th minute after Samir Nasri flicked the ball . to him near the left touchline. The Montenegrin produced a burst of pace . to get away from three Greek defenders, and when two more closed him . down inside the box he steered a clever shot between them and inside the . neat post with goalkeeper Roberto wrong-footed. Olympiacos . were level two minutes later, however, when a neat move opened up the . City defence. Captain Ionnis Maniatis squared the ball to danger man . Diamantakos who drilled it past Hart despite the keeper getting a hand . to it. Both . teams had a goal ruled out for offside, Diamantakos in the second . minute after another incisive move and Edin Dzeko shortly before . half-time. In form: Jovetic scored five goals in three games in the International Champions Cup . Poacher: But Dimitrios Diamantakos was impressive two, notching a double for his side . Blow: Olympiacos replied almost immediately in Minneapolis in the International Champions Cup . OLYMPIACOS: Roberto, Elabdellaoui, Manolas (Ghazaryan 63), Siovas (Papadopoulos 13), Masuaku, Samaris, Maniatis, Kasami (Bouchakalis 63), Dominguez (Avlonitis 63), Saviola (Dossevi 46), Diamantakos. Goals: Diamantakos (36, 66). MANCHESTER CITY: Hart, Clichy (Milner 46), Kolarov, Boyata, Rekik, Fernando (Garcia 46), Navas (Silva 46), Toure (Richards 46), Nasri (Zuculini 46), Jovetic (Sinclair 75), Dzeko (Guidetti 46). Goals: Jovetic (34), Kolarov (53, pen). Booking: Kolarov (45), Milner (50). There . was also one penalty appeal apiece with Olympiacos coach Michel . striding onto the pitch gesticulating angrily when Dedryck Boyata’s . challenge sent Diamantakos tumbling as he raced in on goal. It was a . 50-50 call by referee Fotis Bazakos but Michel, for one, certainly felt . as though he had got it wrong. City . were equally aggrieved on the stroke of half-time, Kolarov talking his . way into the official’s notebook as he protested against the decision . not to award a penalty against substitute Papadopoulos when his untidy . challenge upended Jovetic. City . had the best of the other first-half opportunities. Nasri dragged his . low shot wide when Yaya Toure picked him out unmarked in the box, . Jovetic sidefooted over from an even better position following good work . by Jesus Navas and Dzeko who then squared a wonderful pass that invited . a close-range finished from Nasri but the Frenchman seemed a little . reluctant to go into the challenge with the keeper. Tough tackle: Manchester City forward Stevan Jovetic worked tirelessly throughout the match . Tight marking: Two Olympiacos players double up on City winger Jesus Navas . Wrestle: Samir Nasri is tugged back by Avraam Papadopolous during the game . It . was Nasri’s last contribution to the game because he was one of six . changes made by Pellegrini at half-time. The City boss would probably . have done it anyway but the intense heat – the players twice stopped for . a water break  – and state of the pitch no doubt played a part in his . thinking as well. It . was one of the substitutes who earned City the penalty from which . Kolarov restored their lead in the 53rd minute. David Silva combined . with Jovetic and then cut inside Kostas Manolas who clearly brought the . Spaniard down. There was no hesitation from Mr Bazakos on this occasion . and Kolarov steered his spot-kick into the roof of the net. Diamantakos . struck again in the 66th minute, however, when Olympiacos levelled . against the run of play. Neither Boyata nor Karim Rekik were alive to . the danger when Gevorg Ghazaryan slipped a pass in behind them, and . Diamantakos took the ball around Hart before scoring from a tight angle. Neither . side were able to produce a winner, meaning that City were already . relying on Liverpool losing against AC Milan before they went into the . shootout. It went against them again but Pellegrini is unlikely to have . lost much sleep over it on the flight back.","Manchester City draw 2-2 with Olympiacos in Minneapolis .

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @@CraigHope01 . Alan Pardew was left with plenty to ponder after an inept defensive display allowed Malaga to run out easy 3-1 winners at the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen. On the evidence of their first-half collapse, it will take more than new right-back Daryl Janmaat – watching from the stands – to plug the holes in Newcastle's backline this season. Pardew's side were prised open at will by the La Liga outfit and they duly raced into a three-goal lead by half-time. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Newcastle outcast Gabriel Obertan's fine goal against Malaga' Tough challenge: New signing Emmanuel Riviere tries to get past Malaga's Welington . Bad day in the office: Jack Colback and his Newcastle team-mate look disappointed after conceding to Malaga . Senior centre-backs Fabricio Coloccini – the skipper – and Steven Taylor were culpable, as were full-backs Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa and Massadio Haidara. Pardew will complete the loan signing of striker Facundo Ferreyra next week but he could well be minded to re-enter the market for defensive reinforcements. It took just two minutes for Malaga to fashion their first sight at goal as Ricardo Horta blazed over from 12 yards after Roque Santa Cruz, the former Manchester City striker, delivered from the right. Malaga were exposing the Magpies backline with alarming ease during the early exchanges and Rob Elliot spread his frame to block from Duda after the Portuguese had scampered in on goal. United did work one opening for Moussa Sissoko but his volley, from Remy Cabella's deep free-kick, could only locate the side-netting. Jesus Gamez was causing the Premier League side all manner of problems down the right and, when he landed an inch-perfect cross on the unmarked forehead of Sergi Darder six yards out, the midfielder somehow contrived to nod over the crossbar. Tricky customer: Former Man City striker Roque Santa Cruz featured for Malaga against Newcastle . Newcastle: Elliot, Yanga-Mbiwa (Satka 84), S Taylor, Coloccini (Williamson 74), Haidara (Dummett 46), Abeid (Vuckic 74), Colback (Anita 67), Sissoko (Aarons 46), Armstrong (Obertan 46), Cabella (Riviere 46), Perez (Gouffran 46). Subs not used: Krul, Alnwick, Janmaat, Streete, Tiote, Campbell. Goals: Obertan 60. Malaga starting XI: Kameni, J.Gámez, S.Sánchez, Weligton,Antunes; S.Castillejo, Camacho, S.Darder, Horta; Duda, Santa Cruz. Goals: Darder 25, Castillejo 32 and 4. Darder, though, made amends on 25 minutes when he lashed home the game's opening goal from 25 yards, leaving Elliot helpless as his strike cannoned into the back of the net via the base of the post. Santa Cruz was next to take advantage of United's porous rearguard as he broke free in the area but again Elliot spared his defenders' blushes. There was nothing he could do to prevent Malaga's second on the half-hour mark, however, Gamez escaping down the right yet again before dropping his centre on Samu Castillejo's boot and he dispatched an uncompromising volley beyond Elliot from eight yards. The 19-year-old helped himself to a second just before the break, lashing into the top corner – albeit via the aid of a deflection – having been afforded too much room on the angle of the penalty area. Ignacio Camacho should have made it four shortly after the restart for the second half but headed wide from a corner when unmarked just four yards from goal. Newcastle outcast Gabriel Obertan has been told he can find a new club and the winger did at least serve a reminder of his worth with a fine consolation, leathering into the bottom corner having made strides into the area from a short corner. But it was matters at the other end which will be of Pardew's chief concern.","Former Man United winger Gabriel Obertan gets himself on the scoresheet .

Yoan Gouffran's 42nd-minute header was enough to separate the sides during a physical match which saw Alan Pardew's men suffer four injuries.

The Magpies also lost Mehdi Abeid and Rolando Aarons to injury as Wellington continued to put in strong challenges throughout the game. But Pardew will be relatively pleased overall with his side's display as they overcame an industrious Phoenix side who were let down by their poor finishing in front of goal. Gouffran's header was somewhat fortuitous - he opportunistically capitalised on a mistake from Phoenix goalkeeper Glen Moss, who ran past Vurnon Anita's cross, allowing his French team-mate to nod into the net. And the Wellington outfit had beaten West Ham 2-1 earlier in the week and the Magpies were troubled at times by their hard-working side.

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Even by pre-season standards, Moussa Sissoko had endured a torrid afternoon. Invariably he had passed it to an opposition jersey or, worse still, straight out of play. But following a sedate 88 minutes, it was he who sparked life into this most turgid affair. Gabriel Obertan attacked the by-line and drew back to the edge of the area where Sissoko was lurking. Embrace: Managers Alan Pardew and Jagoba Arrasate greet each other before the game . Tussle: Massaido Haidara and former Real Madrid midfielder Esteban Granero fight for the ball . Given how he had performed until that point, fans in the Gallowgate End would have been forgiven had they ducked for cover. But the France international kept his composure and produced the game's one moment of quality, tucking into the bottom corner to win the game for his side. It was United's final friendly of the summer but manager Alan Pardew would have taken little from it. In the 10th minute Daryl Janmaat escaped down the right but his low cross skipped off the greasy surface and into the arms of Geronimo Rulli with Emmanuel Riviere sliding in. The best chance of the opening exchanges came the way of the visitors when Inigo Martinez split the back four to spring Imanol Agirretxe clear. The striker, however, tried to be too cute and his chip was easily gathered by Tim Krul. Slide: Yoan Gouffran slides in for a tackle during the first half against Real Sociedad .

And that was as close as either side came during a subdued first half. Pardew introduced Rolando Aarons during the break and his arrival triggered an improvement in tempo. Jack Colback swapped passes with Riviere and burst into the area only to see his low drive blocked by a sliding Markel Bergara. Aarons then escaped three defenders but, with options left and right, elected to shoot and scuffed tamely into the arms of Rulli. The Sociedad stopper was again called into action on the hour mark, producing an instinctive one-handed save to deny Mike Williamson after he had headed towards the top corner from Remy Cabella's corner. And so it was left to Sissoko to win it after fine work from Obertan. Thankfully, the full-time whistle sounded soon after. Competitive action cannot come quickly enough.

Hoops boss Harry Redknapp fielded a near-full strength side for the pre-season friendly clash in Ireland as his side gear up for a return to the Premier League next season.

Rangers doubled their lead before half-time when Austin grabbed his first with header from a Joey Barton corner. The visitors then left it late to complete the scoreline with a quick double salvo.

"By . Gerard Brand . Follow @@gedbrand10 . Clint Hill's own goal gave Greek side PAOK a deserved win at Loftus Road as Harry Redknapp's final preparations before the new Premier League season ended with an uninspiring defeat. Substitute Hill turned home a dangerous cross with just over 20 minutes remaining, while new signing Jordon Mutch made his debut for Redknapp's side, playing the full 90 minutes. Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker promised much for the new season in a five-man defensive line, but question marks still remain over the future of striker Loic Remy, who was not named on the bench for Saturday's game despite taking part in a full training session beforehand. Ready for the new season: Shaun Wright-Phillips was bright for the home side during their 1-0 defeat . Strong in the challenge: Charlie Austin holds off PAOK's Stelios Kitsiou at Loftus Road on Saturday afternoon .

Subs not used: Giakoumis, Skondras, Katsikas, Tziolis, Pereyra, Koulouris, Spyropoulos, Konstantinidis, Pozatzidis, Tzandaris, Savvidis . Goal: Hill o.g 67 . Redknapp ended pre-season with three wins out of seven going into Saturday's opener at home to Hull City. His side were disjointed in the opening 45 minutes, failing to register a shot on target despite fielding a strong side for the Greek Superleague runners up. Joey Barton struck a speculative effort over the bar in the opening minutes after goalkeeper Glykos Panagiotis scuffed his kick, before Mutch's cross-cum-shot flew just wide after muscling his way into the area. Mutch, making his debut, did just enough to impress a sparse Loftus Road crowd on his debut, the 6ft 2in new signing providing height and strength in midfield and a threat in the penalty area. With seven Premier League goals last term, the £6million capture from Cardiff should be money well spent. But the home side did anything but impress. A long ball pumped upfield by PAOK was headed clear by Ferdinand but only as far as Robert Mak, who hit wide on the volley. Fun in the sun: QPR boss Harry Redknapp watches on as his team end their pre-season with defeat to PAOK . The visitors should have been one up after 12 minutes, Eyal Golasa seeing his effort blocked by Caulker after Richard Dunne had misjudged a cross. QPR have a goalscorer in Charlie Austin, in the Championship at least. Time will tell whether he can reproduce that form in the Premier League, but QPR do have a proven hit man in Remy. The Frenchman, who travelled with Redkapp's side to Ireland a week ago for their pre-season tour, trained on the pitch before Saturday's game despite not being considered fully match fit. His failed move to Liverpool created another unwanted transfer saga, but QPR will want to concentrate on integrating him back into the fold to partner last season's top scorer Austin. QPR's No 9 was shy in front of goal despite hitting four in pre-season, opting to make one pass too many before a dire first-half came to a close. Just after the break, Stefanos Athanasiadis' first-time effort forced a superb save out of Robert Green having been found in yards of space inside the penalty area. Green then produced another fine stop down low to his right from Mak's effort, before Athanasiadis' rebounded effort hit the post with the goal gaping from three yards. PAOK continued to dominate the game as substitute Nedum Onuoha made a last-ditch tackle to deny Dimitris Salpingidis in the six-yard box. And the Greeks deservedly led after 67 minutes. Substitute Facundo Pereyra drove into the box, slid the ball into the danger area for Hill to knock into his own goal. It took until the 71st minute for QPR to test the opposite goalkeeper; substitute Karl Henry's long-range effort tipped over by Asterios Giakoumis. From the resulting corner, Austin's header was cleared off the line as QPR sprung to life. However, despite the tight scoreline, QPR were well beaten.","Recent signing Jordon Mutch made his first start following move to QPR .

"By . David Kent . Jos Hooiveld’s close-range strike shortly after half-time was enough for Ronald Koeman’s Southampton to beat Swindon Town 1-0 during their friendly at the County Ground on Monday evening. The centre-back broke the deadlock in the 51st minute, when he reacted quickest to James Ward-Prowse’s outswinging corner to flick the ball past the despairing dive of Swindon goalkeeper Wes Foderingham. The Saints’ recent signing from Feyenoord, Graziano Pelle, looked lively in the opening stages, and could have put his side ahead as early as the ninth minute when he met a cross from the right by Nathaniel Clyne only to head straight into the arms of the grateful Foderingham.

Goal: Hooiveld. Minutes later Pelle turned provider for Clyne, but the young . full-back could not find the back of the net with his well-struck effort from . distance. Pelle’s hold-up play was the highlight for Koeman’s team in . a fairly low-tempo affair at the County Ground, the Italian-born forward keeping . the ball well from Swindon’s dogged defenders during his 62 minutes on the . pitch. After dominating much of the first half Southampton . deservedly went ahead six minutes after the break. Hooiveld prodded past Foderingham from Ward-Prowse’s . enticing corner, and moments later the latter nearly doubled Saints’ lead with . a glancing header that flew just over the crossbar.

"By . Adam Crafton . Follow @@AdamCrafton_ . An unfamiliar scent of stability is wafting through the Lancashire air. Following the bedlam of recent years, when a Venky's chicken was a surer bet to last longer than a Venky's football manager, Blackburn Rovers have now staggered into some stability with the forthright Gary Bowyer. Appointed only 15 months ago in March 2013, Bowyer is, incredibly, the eighth longest-serving manager in the Championship. Under Bowyer, the storm clouds engulfing this club have mellowed into a gentle breeze and for the first time in a long time, optimism abounds ahead of the season opener at home to Cardiff City on Friday evening. Following this spirited draw against Stoke, Blackburn remain undefeated in five pre-season games and they have not lost a football match since March, ending the last campaign with a 12-match unbeaten run and falling only two points short of a play-off place. Goal hero: Stoke's Bojan, pictured alongside Stephen Ireland and Marc Wilson, got himself on the scoresheet . Striking for goal: Bojan scored an equaliser for Stoke City against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park . Blackburn Rovers: Robinson, Baptiste (Songo'o 85), Hanley (Taylor 70), Kilgallon, Spurr (Olsson 73), King (Henley 87), Lowe, Evans (Dunn 76), Conway, Cairney (O'Connell 89), Rhodes (Varney 70). Subs not used: Kean. Goal: Rhodes 38. Stoke City: Begovic (Sorensen 46), Bardsley, Huth, Shawcross (Wilson 63), Muniesa (Pieters 73), Arnautovic (Ireland 46), Nzonzi, Adam (Whelan 63), Diouf, Walters, Crouch (Bojan 46). Subs not used: Ward. Goal: Bojan 69. Attendance: 4,351 . 'Stability is crucial,' Bowyer said. 'Now we have to try and improve again. The players here are not happy with finishing eighth. We want to do better.' Against Stoke, Blackburn, an organised and committed side, demonstrated why supporters are slowly but surely falling back in love with this football club. It was Rovers that opened the scoring shortly before half-time, as Jordan Rhodes darted in front of Ryan Shawcross to glance a header past Asmir Begovic in the Stoke goal. In their anxiety to conform to Financial Fair Play regulations, Blackburn's summer transfer window has brought only a small number of loan moves and free transfers. In Rhodes, however, Blackburn possess one of the most clinical strikers in the English game and his new contract may prove to be the most significant movement that Bowyers will make. Stoke - despite being without a win in pre-season - are a patient and enterprising side under Mark Hughes and they gradually reasserted their foothold on the game, with Bojan, signed from Barcelona, demonstrating his credentials once more with a fine strike from 25 yards that flew past Paul Robinson in the Blackburn goal. We will soon learn whether he can indeed hack a wet, windy night at the Britannia but in the sunshine at Blackburn, the 23-year-old - who once kept Zlatan Ibrahimovic out of the Barcelona team - was head and shoulders above all those on show. 'He's a quality player,' Hughes smiled. 'It's not just his finishing ability but his ability to pick a pass in tight spaces. Even when there are a lot of bodies around him, he always seems to have time on the ball and that is a reflection of a great player. We will benefit from that, certainly.'","Stoke summer signing Bojan gets himself on the scoresheet at Ewood Park .

A youthful Sunderland side secured their fourth pre-season win on the bounce, as they beat Recreativo Huelva 1-0 thanks to a late penalty from teenage French striker Mikael Mandron. Gus Poyet's men have racked up impressive wins against Darlington, Carlisle and Hartlepool on home soil in recent weeks - scoring nine goals and conceding just once - but their winning streak looked set to end before Mandron smashed home a spot-kick in the 78th minute. The Uruguayan coach started his U21 side at the Estadio Municipal de Albufeira for the match against Spanish side Recreativo, the first of three pre-season friendlies they they will play in Porgual before returning for the start of the Premier League season. Cool customer: Mandron smashes his penalty home to seal Sunderland's 1-0 victory against Recreativo . Match-winner: Mandron is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring his second winner in a week . Battling for possession: Sunderland midfielder George Honeyman tussles for the ball with Recreativo's Dimas . Martin Smith came within a whisker of giving the Black Cats the lead in the 23rd minute when he smashed a free-kick on to the crossbar from 25 yards. The rebound fell to David Ferguson on the edge of the box but his first-time effort arrowed just wide.

Recreativo then had their best chance of the first half when Victor Diaz nearly scored with an ambitious backheel, only for Liam Agnew to hack the ball away on the goal-line. Poyet made a number of changes at the break, with Vito Mannone the only substitute not to appear at the start of the second half. Shortly before the hour mark Recreativo hit the woodwork through defender Herman Menosse, the Uruguayan thumping a header against the crossbar with Joel Dixon well-beaten. In the 72nd minute Sunderland were forced into bringing Duncan Watmore back on, despite the midfielder being subbed off at the break. Having used all their outfield substitutions, the youngster trotted back on to replace George Honeyman, who had picked up an injury. And six minutes after that change, Poyet's side were ahead. Charis Mavrias was brought down by Avila inside the Recreativo penalty area and the referee quickly pointed to the spot. Mandron stepped up to take the spot-kick and made no mistake from 12 yards, blasting his effort into the back of the net.

Spurs replied five minutes later through Soldado's well-taken penalty before Seattle took the lead once more through Tristan Bowen who tapped home Sean Okoli's cross with his first touch of the game. However, Tottenham avoided defeat as Iago Falque, who spent last season on loan at Rayo Vallecano, scored from the penalty spot having won the spot-kick after kicking the ball against the hand of Seattle defender DeAndre Yeldin.

"By . David Kent . Erik Lamela showed glimpses of why Tottenham spent £30million on him with a friendly double against Toronto. The 22-year old Argentine, who made just nine Barclays Premier League appearances in an injury-hit campaign last season, has vowed to recreate the form which brought him 15 Serie A goals in 2012-13 with Roma. And if he continues like this, he just might. Lamela firing his first on 18 minutes with a Gareth Bale-esque finish from just inside the box, and his second with equal aplomb five minutes before the break.

Subs not used: McGee, Fredericks. Goals: Lamela 18, 40. Townsend 85 . Roberto Soldado was provider for both in the pre-season friendly at BM Field, giving further optimism to Spurs fans, who saw former striker Jermain Defoe captain their opponents. Lamela's opener came after Christian Eriksen launched a swift counter-attack on the right, bursting into the Toronto half before feeding Soldado. As the Spanish forward approached the area, he looked up and sprayed a pass across the area. Aaron Lennon unselfishly left the ball for the advancing Lamela, whose low left-footed shot whistled past Chris Konopka and into the bottom right-hand corner. Lamela started the move which led to his second, finding Lennon and making a lung-busting run into the box. The former England winger slipped the ball to Soldado on the edge of the area. Spotting the onrushing Lamela, his perfectly-weighted pass was controlled by Lamela before he blasted home from a tight angle with another clinical left foot effort. At half-time, Mauricio Pochettino made 10 substitutions, with only Brad Friedel remaining from the first-half XI. Toronto punished defensive uncertainty between central defensive pairing Michael Dawson and Zeki Fryers by battling back to restore parity. Substitute Andrew Wiedeman was involved in both, hitting the first before setting up Jordan Hamilton, who defied his 18 years by beating Friedel with a cool finish from inside the area. But Andros Townsend showed his class with a quality finish to win the game for Spurs. Lewis Holtby snatched possession and surged forward, feeding the England winger on the left.

"By . Rob Draper, Mail on Sunday Chief Football Writer . Mauricio Pochettino will be pleased enough with a comfortable victory over Champions League qualifiers Schalke but alarmed by the manner in which Spurs almost let the Bundesliga side back into the game late on. Tottenham looked to be convincing winners until a shaky last 15 minutes – but at least saw Ben Davies get his first run out at White Hart Lane and encouraging displays from Andros Townsend, Roberto Soldado and Erik Lamela. Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor both established credentials for starting at West Ham next week by getting on the scoresheet – but Erik Lamela’s first half display was the most intriguing. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mauricio Pochettino praise his team after Schalke friendly . Opening goal: Emmanuel Adebayor puts Spurs ahead with a left-foot strike in the first half .

Goal: Boateng 80 . Referee: Anthony Taylor . Pochettino does seem to be coaxing performances of his compatriot, who barely registered last season after his £30m move. The Argentine looked sharp, bright and ready to impress in the first half, before being one of a number of half-time substitutions. Lamela was involved in the opening goal’s build up, sweeping the ball to Aaron Lennon, who in turn moved it on to Lewis Holtby. The former Schalke player drove in a cross and Emmanuel Adebayor controlled and finished well on 29 minutes. But though Spurs moved the ball well enough, Pochettino was a constant presence on the touchline, cajoling his team, urging them to calm down in possession but apparently not happy with the closing down when attempting to win the ball back. With Jan Vertonghen, Michael Dawson, Paulinho and possibly Etienne Capoue to come back into this team and with Kyle Walker recovering from injury, Pochettino hasn’t quite shown his full hand as yet. Nevertheless there were encouraging signs. Eric Dier, born in Essex but raised in Portugal and a summer signing from Sporting, looked comfortable at centre half. Getting comfortable: Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino watches on during his side's 2-1 win at White Hart Lane . High tackle: Kaan Ayhan challenges Danny Rose as the Spurs left-back tries to break forward for the hosts . On the scoresheet: Spanish striker Roberto Soldado doubled Spurs' leader in the second half . Smiles all round: Lewis Holtby rushes to congratulate Soldado after his quick reactions made it 2-0 . Christian Eriksen carried on where he left off last season with a fine range of passing, playing in Lennon on 14 minutes only for Schalke keeper Ralf Fahrmann to race from his line to smother the ball. And Holtby should have done better against his old club on 27 minutes but hesitated before shooting , allowing Fahrmann to save. Schalke, who start their season their Bundesliga campaign in two weeks but who have a domestic cup tie in eight days time, offered little resistance. They sauntered through the first half, barely threatening, their only meagre offering being an off-target striker by Kevin Prince Boateng on 45 minutes. The raft of half-time substitutions included Davies coming on and looking capable enough. Townsend looked bright, coming on for Lennon, and sprinting away to cross for Soldado, but the Spaniard lifted his shot well over on 53 minutes. Out to impress: £30m man Erik Lamela looks to be back to full fitness for Spurs ahead of the new season . Familiar face: Kevin-Prince Boateng, right, netted Schalke's goal in the 80th minute of the game . Townsend was less impressive in front of goal, curling a shot wide on 58 minutes when played in by Eriksen. However, he improved on 68 minutes, unleashing an excellent striker that Fahrman did well to push away. First to react though was Soldado, diving forward to send a looping header back over Fahrmann and into the net for 2-0. However, Tottenham’s complacency almost allowed a victory to slip away when Dennis Aogo found room down the left to cross for former Spurs man Kevin-Prince Boateng, who stroked the ball home on 80 minutes. Hugo Lloris then got a rare touch on 83 minutes, being forced to dive to his right to touch away Donis Avdijaj’s strike.","Emmanuel Adebayor put Spurs ahead with a calm finish in 29th minute .

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . England took on Germany in a penalty shootout and won, but not without the helping hand of a big Finn. For Jussi Jaaskelainen was West Ham's hero as they overcame hosts Schalke 7-6 following a dire goalless draw in Gelsenkirchen. The stopper saved from Felipe Santana and then, decisively, from Axel Borgmann as a tedious contest reached a thrilling climax hardly in keeping with the previous 90 minutes. At long last: West Ham celebrate beating Schalke on penalties after a 0-0 draw . Big Finn: Jussi Jaaskelainen was the hero for the Hammers, saving the final spot-kick . WEST HAM: Jaaskelainen; O'Brien, Tomkins (Reid 46), Collins, Potts; Downing (Vaz Te 78), Kouyate (Diame 54), Poyet, Fanimo (Lletget 54); Nolan; C.Cole (Lee 83) SCHALKE: Giefer, Freidrich, Kolasinac (Avdijaj 62), Boateng, Hoger, Choupo-Moting (Aogo 62), Fuchs, Barnetta (Meyer 46), Multhaup, Matip (Santana 46), Neustadter . PENALTIES: 0:1 Nolan, Neustadt 1:1, 1:2 Collins, 2:2 Meyer, Vaz Te Fires, 3:2 Papadopoulos, 3: 3 Lee, Jaaskelainen parried against Santana, Poyet 3:4, 4:4 Aogo, 4:5 O’Brien, 5:5 Itter, 5:6 Potts, Sobottka 6:6, 6:7 Lletget. In an arduous first half, Schalke's Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting escaped down the right before centring and Jaaskelainen had to be on his guard to save at the near post. Christian Fuchs took aim from range for the hosts and was unlucky to see his effort whistle narrowly over the crossbar. Cameroon international Choupo-Moting looked Schalke's best bet for a goal and he cracked the base of the post having seized on a mistake by James Collins. The same player the drilled wide from distance before teeing up Kevin-Prince Boateng whose effort was saved by Jasskelainen. The former Finland international was again called into action before the break as he got down low to repel defender Marvin Friedrich's measured steer after Schalke had worked a short corner into the area. Strong: James Collins of West Ham does well to tackle Schalke star Kevin Prince Boateng on Saturday . Pinned to his chair: Hammers boss Sam Allardyce watches on from the sidelines in Gelsenkirchen . On the run: Joey O'Brien looks to make things happen for West ham . It was from a corner after half-time that the Hammers got their first real sight at goal, Stewart Downing's floater landed on the forehead of Collins but he flashed wide when unmarked just six yards out. Friedrich then struck the post following a goalmouth scramble midway through the second period but chances were at a premium as the half wore on. And so it was that Jaaskelainen emerged the hero as Sam Allardyce celebrated his first victory of a difficult pre-season which has seen Andy Carroll ruled out for four months because of an ankle injury and co-owner David Gold 'favourite' a Twitter post criticising the boss. Midfielder Ravel Morrison was then remanded in custody after being charged with two counts of common assault.

"By . Michael Gadd . Winston Reid's homecoming didn't go to script for the New Zealand Premier League star as West Ham were beaten by Wellington Phoenix at Auckland's Eden Park. Sam Allardyce's side got more than they bargained for against the team which finish one place above the wooden spoon last A-League season and for Reid, who was handed the captain's armband for the occasion, it'll be a night to forget. The Phoenix took a 2-0 lead into half-time and West Ham were only able to peg one back through new signing Mauro Zarate inside the closing 20 minutes. Shining light: Mauro Zarate's goal was a rare positive sign for Sam Allardyce as West Ham lost to Wellington . Upset: Wellington's Andrew Durante (right) celebrates with team-mates after he heads them into the lead . Hometown hero: New Zealand's Winston Reid was given the captain's armband for the match in Auckland . Wellington Phoenix: Moss (Italiano 81), Muscat, Gorrin (Brindell-South 90), Burns (Boxall 78), Brockie (Krishna 71), Boyd (Cunningham 55), Riera (Blake 84), Fenron, Sigmund, Durante (c), Blake .

Goal: Zarate . It took a slice of individual brilliance from Zarate, making his second appearance for the Hammers after a 33-minute shift in their 0-0 friendly against Ipswich, to give his side a chance to save face. A slick side-step at the top of the penalty area and a powerful finish into the bottom left corner from the Argentinian gave keeper Glen Moss no chance. But the celebrations were muted from the tourists who knew this was rare show of class when the expectations were much higher from both their manager and the crowd. Phoenix took the lead after just 11 minutes after Mark Noble was beaten for pace and gifted the Phoenx a free-kick, which Australian-born New Zealand international Durante headed home. Alex Gorrin made it 2-0 with a solo run that left the Hammers' defence reeling and a solid finish past Jussi Jaaskelainen - it was a magic moment for the 20-year-old who joined Sunderland as a 16-year-old from Tenerife, in Spain, but was let go on a free transfer this season having not graduated from the academy system. Chances to extend the lead kept coming for the . hosts in the second half, including Nathan Burns' curling effort that stretched . Jaaskelainen and added insult to injury for West Ham's opening hour.

Both ends: Goalscorer and All Whites international Durante goes in for a trademark tough challenge on Noble . Allardyce won't have been impressed, especially given Phoenix took the field minus three of their most important players from their last - albeit unsuccessful - campaign. Substitutes rained onto Eden Park in the closing stages, as is customary in friendlies, with Diego Poyet making his debut after his free move from Charlton. Another custom that won't have amused the Hammers came from the Phoenix fans, who traditionally take their tops off if their team is leading going into the final 10 minutes of a match. Stewart Downing, who came on late, went close to an equaliser in the closing stages but was denied by Lewis Italiano, who made his club debut after a move from Perth when he replaced Moss. Before the match, a traditional Maori haka issued a challenge to the Hammers they couldn't meet. Both sides also paid tribute to Newcastle United fans John Adler and Liam Sweeney, and those who were lost in the MH17 tragedy over the Ukraine.","Andrew Durante and Alex Gorrin scored first-half goals for the hosts .

Sullivan was there, looking animated throughout, but co-chairman David Gold was unable to reach the ground, having turned back after a four-lorry pile up at Dartford tunnel. In his absence, though, West Ham dominated the opening exchanges with a strong starting XI. And Matt Jarvis was at the heart of the lot. The winger first fed Carlton Cole to create a chance on the turn, before Jarvis's inch-perfect cross found Cheikhou Kouyate, whose header sailed over. The 28-year-old, then, had a go himself, stretching to fashion a chance but missing the target. It was encouraging, and new boy Aaron Cresswell almost haunted his former employers on his return. The 24-year-old left goalkeeper Dean Gerken for dead with a deft job, but only saw it crash off the face of the crossbar on his old stomping ground. At half time, the expected changes were made. Among them was new signing Diego Poyet, who said he was 'glad to get another 45 minutes on the pitch'. There was also Zarate, replacing Cole, but the striker's debut was short lived to say the least. The Argentinian forward from Velez Sarsfield lasted a little more than half an hour before going off. West Ham tried to make the breakthrough in the second half but looked deflated, unable to crack Ipswich's code. Nevertheless, there were signs of encouragement from Kouyate and Co overall.

West Ham United joint-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold said: 'We have a very clear vision of how we want West Ham United to operate under our joint ownership. Although not everybody understands the West Ham Way, we do and we respect it as we have been supporters all our lives. We believe this is about a philosophy that is not just about the style of play, but the whole ethos that surrounds the club. 'Sam was asked to give us a detailed presentation on his vision for next season and during this he assured us that he can deliver that ethos to West Ham United and we have agreed to support him with the resources that he needs. We have mapped out a way forward with him that will ensure our much-deserving fans have more to cheer about next season. 'We should also stress, though, that while improvements do need to be made, Sam deserves credit for the job he has done thus far after securing promotion in his first year and two respectable Premier League finishes in the two years thereafter. 'We have also seen the likes of Mark Noble, James Tomkins and Winston Reid all make huge progress under his management, which in turn contributed to our impressive record of 14 clean sheets last season. 'The truly historic opportunity of a move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016 forms a major part of our five-year strategy to take this club forward and, while we have a duty to make sure we stay in the Premier League, we also want to make sure the performances on the pitch will befit a team playing in such a world-renowned stadium. 'We are absolutely committed to taking West Ham United to new heights and we want to see the Club continue on an upward trajectory next season. The 2014-15 campaign is crucial to our future and we are confident that Sam has the passion, experience and determination to make sure it is a success.'

"By . Lucy Waterlow for MailOnline . It's been 50 years since Mary Poppins first burst onto cinema screens with her wise words, magical umbrella and bottomless bag. So to celebrate her half century, Britain's famous brand of Norland Nannies, hired by the rich, royal and famous, are giving back to families in need. The Norland Agency has partnered with the Twins and Multiple Births Association (Tamba) to provide a service called Helping Hands, which gives free practical short-term support in the home for parents with twins, triplets and more who are in crisis. It's a far cry from the usual Norland clientele, which includes the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The royals hired Norland graduate . Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo to help them care for Prince George. Left: Mary Poppins, starring Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews turns fifty today; Right: Ishbel Brown, one of the nannies from Britain's famous Norland agency who is volunteering to mark the iconic character's half century . Mick Jagger . and his ex-wife Jerry Hall used a Norland nanny when their children were . young, while Princess Anne and the Duchess of York are among royalty . who have called upon their services. One of the nannies involved in the scheme is Ishbel Brown, 26, from Northumberland. She told MailOnline why she has volunteered: 'I feel privileged that I've been able to train at Norland so I wanted to give something back,' she said. 'It's expensive having one baby so imagine when you need double or triple of everything. It can be really hard for families to cope. 'But it's inspiring to see how resourceful they can be. Lots of families can't afford brand new toys but give a baby a wooden spoon and a pan and they can be occupied for hours.' As an experienced nanny of six years, Ishbel knows how challenging it can be for parents to care for just one baby at a time. So what advice does she have for people with twins and triplets? Actors Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins and Dick Van Dyke as Bert in a scene from Mary Poppins, which turns fifty today . 'There's no magic formula - you have to work around the babies. Some are happy to be fed . together and in some cases it's possible to breastfeed twins at the same . time,' she explains. 'It's very common with twins to top up . with formula but it all depends on the mother's milk supply. It's even . harder with triplets. I've personally never met a mum of triplets who . has solely breastfed. 'I recommend people go to as many support and play groups aimed at parents with twins and triplets as possible - like the ones run by Tamba. 'Having multiples can feel really overwhelming, so it's good to talk to people in the same situation.' With their crisp brown uniforms, impeccable manners and traditional values, the Norland Nannies are often compared to the fictional Mary Poppins - made famous by the Disney film which was first released 50 years ago starring Julie Andrews. But Norland has been training nannies for far longer than Mary Poppins has been a firm family favourite. The college in Bath was founded by Emily Ward in 1892 under the motto 'Love Never Faileth'. Alongside child care, the students have always learnt how to cook, sew and administer first aid. But they have also moved with the times, and more recent graduates have been trained in self defence and even been advised on how to escape from paparazzi. Ishbel Brown is one of the Norland Nannies volunteering her time to twins charity Tamba . The latter has become necessary since the nannies are the go-to service for A-Listers looking for an extra pair of hands to help with their offspring. Ishbel said she believes the services of the Norland nannies remain in demand because parents still want to imbue their children with traditional values. 'Norland teaches us to have fun with the children in our care but to also ensure that they grow up respectfully with good morals and good manners,' she explains. As well as undertaking their usual workload, in the past year, Noland Nannies have pulled on their distinctive uniforms to provide 1644 hours of free help to more than 17 struggling families. These parents may have been coping with everything from severe medical complications, to parental bereavement, postnatal depression and serious behavioural problems. Norland graduate and nanny to Prince George, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, (left) accompanied the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George (right) on their official tour of New Zealand . Claire Burgess, early years consultant for Norland and honorary consultant for Tamba said: 'Norland is so pleased to be able to support families of multiples in this way and have been overwhelmed by the response from our nannies who have volunteered their time and expertise without any charge.' Whilst the Norland Nannies provide the free help, Tamba covers the nannies' travel expenses and accommodation through the charity's Helping Hands fund. Keith Reed, Tamba CEO said: 'We are so grateful for the support that Norland Nannies provide our families. Each week we receive phone calls from parents who are at breaking point for all kinds of reasons, whether from financial pressures, a marriage breakdown or deterioration in health. Any family can find themselves in a crisis but with Norland's support these families can move towards getting back on their feet.' To be eligible for the Helping Hands programme families need to have multiples, be unable to afford to pay for help themselves and be in serious need of assistance. Families must have sought help from family, friends, neighbours or other external agencies and will need to receive support for their application from a health professional. Those families that are not eligible under the Helping Hands criteria will be directed to other sources of support that are appropriate for their individual situation.

His first goal, although fortuitous, displayed a real striker's instinct. Evans passed the ball straight to Samir Carruthers, who put the ball into Grigg's path and the striker placed by ball past David de Gea. The second was arguably even more impressive, however. Grigg ghosted in behind Anderson and, with no United centre-backs in sight, chested a pinpoint cross into the back of the net.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . There must have been many occasions when critics of controversial Toronto mayor Rob Ford have wanted to throw a bucket of ice over his head - and now he has done the job for them. Mr Ford performed the stunt as part of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge charity fundraising craze that is sweeping the internet, in which people around the world pour buckets of ice water over their heads  and then nominate someone else to follow suit. The nominee has 24 hours to comply or donate $100 to the charity as a forfeit. Scroll down for video . Cold shoulders: Rob Ford gets his icy soaking from brother Doug (left) and his nominator Tie Domi . Among the celebrities who have joined the craze are pop stars Justin Bieber and Britney Spears, and golfer Tiger Woods. Mr Ford, 45, went through with the stunt after being nominated by former Toronto Maple Leafs ice hockey player Tie Domi, who got his soaking last week. In a video posted on YouTube, Domi helped the mayor's brother, Doug Ford, empty a garbage bin full of ice water over the mayor's head. In the video, the mayor stands in front of a large 'Ford for Mayor' banner and says: 'Hi, I am Mayor Ford. I have been called out by legendary Maple Leaf Tie Domi for the ice bucket challenge for ALS.' Turning to Domi, he shouts: 'Tie, I accept your challenge. Let's bring it on.' Domi and Doug Ford appear, pick up a plastic bin emblazoned with more 'Ford Mayor' stickers and tip it over the his head.

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . An American rapper who is thought to have been killed in Syria while fighting for ISIS was a school friend of an Islamic convert who joined the terrorist group al-Shabab, it has emerged. It was confirmed by a state official on Tuesday that Douglas McArthur McCain travelled to Syria to join a militant group, most likely the Islamic State, and had been killed fighting over the weekend. Now it has been revealed that McCain, who had most recently lived in San Diego but grew up outisde Minneapolis, attended the same high school as Troy Kastigar, who died in 2009 aged 28, while fighting for al-Shabab in Somalia. Scroll down for video . Douglas McArthur McCain, left, who died fighting in Syria struck up a high school friendship with Troy Kastigar, right, who died fighting for al-Shabab in Somalia in 2009 . Both men were said to have struck up a close friendship with each other during their time at  Robbinsdale Cooper High School in the town of New Hope, where McCain graduated in 1999. Kastigar's mother Julianne Boada told the NY Daily News: 'They both were sort of searching, it seemed like. 'It’s just like who would ever have predicted this outcome. For Troy, he was so bright again. It was really a path that was so wonderful to him. 'They had quite a few friends in school who were Somali immigrants and an African American friend whose family was Muslim.' It has been reported that Kastigar converted to Islam three years before he travelled to Somalia and appeared in a video where he was lauded as one of the 'Minnesotan martyrs'. Smiling and laughing in the footage, . Kastigar called his battle experiences 'the real Disneyland' and urged . other Muslims to come and 'take pleasure in this fun.' He was killed in 2009 in the Somali capital Mogadishu, according to the video. It is unknown when the pair last had contact. It . comes following the death of McCain, after pictures of his body, . showing his distinctive neck tattoo, and his passport were shared by the . Free Syrian Army. Minnesota criminal courts records show McCain had a few minor traffic offences, including two instances where he was convicted of giving police a false name or ID in 2003 (left) and 2008 (right) His cousin Kenyata McCain, told the Minneapolis Star . Tribune that she had spoken to him as recently as Friday and 'he was . telling all of us he was in Turkey.' 'I know that he had strong Muslim beliefs,' she told the newspaper. 'But I didn't know that he was in support of ISIS. I didn't think he would be.' At an apartment complex in New Hope, Shelly Chase remembered McCain as a friendly boy who welcomed her nine-year-old son, Isaac, when the Chase family moved in some two decades ago. Even though McCain was a few years older, the boys used to lift weights, hit punching bags and play basketball. Both Shelly Chase and her son, now 28, fought back tears as they talked about McCain. 'I'm holding in the tears, I really am, because this is hard. He was a good kid,' Shelly Chase said. 'Someone must have persuaded him.' Isaac Chase said he had always looked up to McCain. Chase joined the military in 2007, and said before he left, he knew McCain was running into trouble, sometimes smoking marijuana at the park. Minnesota criminal courts records show McCain had a few minor traffic offences, including two instances where he was convicted of giving police a false name or ID. 'I don't know if he was just lost or what,' Isaac Chase said. 'He was a good person at heart.' The . Free Syrian Army claims to have found McCain's body after a fight with . ISIS. McCain's American passport was found in his pocket along with $800 . in cash . He said he last talked to McCain in 2008 when he was home on leave. McCain told Isaac he was proud of him, and he was trying to straighten out his own life, Isaac said. A 26-year-old aid worker who was kidnapped from Syria last year has been confirmed as the third hostage held captive by the Islamic State (aka ISIS). The terror-group has demanded a $6.6million ransom for the woman, as well as the release of imprisoned neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, according to reports. The hostage's family has asked for her name not to be released for fear of her safety.  She is the third of at least four hostages held by ISIS, including executed photojournalist James Foley. The ransom was revealed on Monday, at a press conference held on behalf of Siddiqui's family, who are trying to distance themselves from ISIS. It was also confirmed through a close friend of the unidentified hostage's family. News of the ransom comes just a week after the group beheaded Mr Foley in a savage propaganda video posted online. FBI Director James Comey said in June that roughly 100 people had left the United States to join the conflict in Syria. Comey said the terrorism threat of today 'has spread, metastasized. ... The traveler problem makes it even more difficult, because the people going to Syria are not from any particular demographic. They're not from any particular part of the United States.' Comey's remarks came during a visit to the FBI's field office in Minneapolis, which has struggled in recent years with several young Somali-Americans leaving the United States to join the terror group al-Shabab in Somalia. FBI spokesman E.K. Wilson said agents continue to investigate reports that several young men have left the Minneapolis area for overseas locations, including Syria. 'We have done extensive outreach recently, as we have the last seven years, but we've had a concerted effort ... over the last few months,' he said, as reports of travel to Syria surfaced. Friends of McCain were incredulous after being told of the circumstances of his death. 'He was a goofball in high school,' a classmate told NBC. 'Doug was a fun guy to be around. Played basketball, joked a lot, had a small sense of humor. Got along with most … Wasn't the best athlete, but liked to play.” Another friend who would go to teen nights at the YMCA with McCain called him a 'good guy who loved his family and friends. 'He would be the light in anyone's darkness. He always made you smile with his goofy self.' After graduating in 1999, he stayed in Minnesota for some time according to his criminal record. He was arrested in 2000, at the age of 19, for disorderly conduct and then again in 2006 for obstruction. He was convicted on both charges. According to his Twitter, he converted to Islam around 2004, referring to himself as 'Duale ThaslaveofAllah' and his online posts become much more fervent. ISIS are an extremist group currently invading Iraq from Syria in an attempt to establish a caliphate. Last week they brutally beheaded American journalist James Foley in a video posted online . Among his likes on Facebook are the 'Quaran and Hadith' and 'The Black Flag' as well as Pizza Hut and the Chicago Bulls . At some point he traveled to Sweden where he performed sometimes as a rapper. Kevin Kohlin knew him there and says they often played basketball together and chatted about hip-hop music. 'We would talk just a little bit about religion,' Kohlin added. 'He respected my Christianity.' McCain appears to have moved back to San Diego recently where he worked at a Somali restaurant for sometime. An acquaintance at the restaurant said he was normal and 'open-minded' and just 'wanted to be a good Muslim'. In September 2010, he posted an ominous image that had the caption, 'They are coming back soldiers of Allah.' It appears that McCain crossed into Syria from Turkey in the last few months. He tweeted to another ISIS fighter in June his intention to join them in 'r town' - mostly likely meaning Raqqa . News of McCain's death comes as ISIS has demanded a $6.6million ransom for an American aid worker held hostage . His MySpace profile contains similar messages, with photographs of McCain with the Quran captioned, 'The Quran is all I need in this life of sin.' In April, McCain retweeted an English translation of a speech given by an ISIS spokesman and soon after that was spotted in Turkey - a common entryway into Syria. McCain attended high school in Minnesota where he played for the basketball team, and once performed as a rapper . Three months ago, McCain met with friends at a Burger King in Istanbul where they talked about the NBA . In May, McCain began praising the decade anniversary of his conversion to Islam and began to message and friend self-declared jihadis online. On June 9, he tweeted to another ISIS fighter that 'I will be joining you guys soon'. He also asked if another jihadist had made it to 'r town' - most likely referencing the ISIS-stronghold city of Raqqa. Later he posted: 'I'm with the brothers now'. His last tweet was on August 19. Several of McCain's friends and family members have taken to Facebook to mourn his loss. His younger sister  posted a collage of three pictures with her brother, and wrote a brief memorial. 'I really don't understand why and how and I have no words, I never thought this will be the way we say goodbye. You where my oldest brother, my biggest headache, the one I argue with the most, my words when I needed you to be. I can hear you now saying ""lele guess what, I'm awesome"" and that big brother you are. This is absolutely unreal to me I love you big brother.'

"By . Ruth Styles . With her long blonde hair, perfectly made-up face and petite frame, Natasha Payne, 51, looks every inch the glamorous athlete. But her looks don't tell the whole truth. Less than eight years ago, she was living the life of a naval officer under the name she was born with - David. Now living as a woman with her girlfriend Mary Watson, 26, in Newcastle, Ms Payne says her life has changed for the better which has allowed her to pursue another passion - for pole-dancing. Scroll down for video . New lease of life: Natasha Payne, 51, says she is overjoyed by the success of her pole-dancing career . Indeed, so good is Ms Payne, she took bronze for Team GB in the over-50 category at last year's World Pole-Dancing Championships. 'I competed as a woman against dancers from all over the world,' she reveals in an interview with Closer magazine. 'I was amazed when I won bronze - I'd come a long way from the confused boy I used to be.' Ms Payne's life has changed immeasurably since coming out as transgender in 2008. After joining the navy and marrying aged 27, she went on to have a son and, outwardly at least, appeared to be living a happy, normal life as a devoted husband and father. But when Ms Payne, who says she had always felt trapped in the wrong body, plucked up the courage to tell his wife of his feelings, things began to go wrong. 'She was shocked but sympathetic,' she says. 'It was hard for her to accept and the relationship broke down three years later.' Brave: Ms Payne, who came out as transgender in 2008, was a member of the Royal Navy until 1999 . After leaving the Navy in 1999, she remarried but her new wife was uncomfortable with her desire to live as a woman and in 2008, the couple divorced. Single once more, Ms Payne decided the time had come to begin living as a woman full time - a decision that her McDonalds manager girlfriend Mary completely supports. Miss Watson also encouraged her to begin pole-dancing - a move which, says Ms Payne, has since given her confidence a real boost. 'I began going to classes to keep fit and I loved it so I started performing in local clubs,' she enthuses. 'The response was amazing - I had straight men flirting with me.' Flexible: Ms Payne took the bronze medal in the over-50s category at the Pole-Dancing World Championships . Delighted: She says she is thrilled at her success and says it has given her a huge confidence boost . Four years on, Ms Payne's pole-dancing career is going from strength to strength and she says she's never been happier. 'Mary is proud of my dancing and comes to watch me sometimes,' she says. 'My son has seen me perform too and supports me because he knows it makes me happy. I hope it'll become an Olympic sport.' And if it does, Ms Payne's name will undoubtedly be the first on the team sheet.

"By . Lydia Warren . Toronto Mayor Rob Ford might be free of drugs and alcohol after two months in rehab, but it appears he still has at least one vice. The politician ordered a staggering five espressos in one cup during a drive with Canadian DJ deadmau5, telling the stunned musician: 'It's good, trust me! I pound these espressos back.' The bizarre interaction took place as the two men took a ride in the DJ's 2013 Ferrari 458 Spider F1 Edition, which is plastered with an animated cartoon cat called Nyan Cat. The ride was part of deadmau5's ongoing online series called Coffee Run, in which he picks up a celebrity and they get coffee together. Their conversation is then uploaded, unedited, to YouTube. Scroll down for video . Going big: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford orders five espressos in one cup during a ride with deadmau5. The interaction was filmed by the DJ for his online series, Coffee Run, where he gets coffee with a celebrity . Shock: An incredulous deadmau5 gives Ford a funny look after he orders the caffeine-packed drink . deadmau5 had first reached out to Ford to be part of the show by tweeting at him in April, and on Monday, with Ford settled back to work following his visit to rehab, he picked him up from City Hall. During the 30-minute clip, the two men cover a range of topics - peppered with plenty of expletives. They chat about football, Toronto's pot holes, the city's new $4.5 million BMX track - which Ford brands a 'scam' - and how after work, he goes home, sees his kids and plays Risk. And as they talk about how cell phones and eating behind the wheel make for dangerous drivers, Ford said he would not be making rules against them, explaining: 'I hate government intervention. Live and let live.' 'You're a mayor man!' deadmau5 says, shocked. A laugh: The two Canadians chat about potholes, football and the city's parking on their 30-minute drive . Eventually, they pull up to the window of a Jim Horton's, where Ford orders his five espressos. On hearing the hefty order, deadmau5 is incredulous. 'What does that equate to?' he asks, laughing. 'That's cardiac arrest... You know what that would do to me, dude?' Ford, who gives him money to pay for the coffee, laughs and assures the DJ that 'it's good' and that it helps him stay up all night so that he can call his constituents. Throughout the journey, deadmau5 expresses his shock at the amount of caffeine Ford must be drinking, while the mayor just laughs and double-checks he has been given enough. Five espressos is more than 320mg of caffeine. Doctors deem 400mg a safe daily intake, according to the MayoClinic - meaning that if he really does 'pound' the drinks back, it's a cause for concern.

Ford admitted last year that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor' following months of denials, and he checked into rehab when another video surfaced earlier this year. By comparison, deadmau5 is staunchly anti-drugs and admitted that his only vice is computer games.

"By . James Nye for MailOnline . The American dentist who last week lost his $34,000 legal action against British Airways after he and his partner were flown to Grenada in the Caribbean instead of Granada in Spain has spoken out. Dr. Edward Gamson flew from Washington DC to London in September of 2013 and instead of fulfilling his life-long dream of visiting the medieval city boarded a flight right back across the Atlantic after a ticketing mistake. 'I had a conference in Lisbon, Portugal, and I saw that as my opportunity to finally get to Spain,' said Dr. Gamson, of North Bethesda, Maryland, to ABC News. 'I had always wanted to see the Alhambra in Granada, Spain.' Caribbean paradise: An American dentist visiting Europe has sued BA after the airline refused to reimburse him for two first class tickets after flying him and his partner to Grenada in the Caribbean instead of Granada in Spain . However, Gamson and his partner realized to their horror 20 minutes into their connecting flight that they were not flying southwards from London, back west. 'Within 20 minutes of departing … we look at this little monitor in front of us, and the plane’s heading west, so I go up to the flight attendant and said, ‘Why west? Why not south? We’re going to Spain,’ Gamson recalled. 'He said, ‘Spain, what are you talking about? We’re going to Grenada. We’re in the West Indies,’ and my heart just dropped.' British Airways had allocated them incorrect tickets for their journey and even though Grenada was clearly written out, Gamson claims he didn't notice because he was on vacation. 'We had just flown across the Atlantic first class and really enjoyed it. I think just my mindset was like, ‘Just lay back, and don’t think about it,’ said Gamson to ABC News. Once they arrived in the Caribbean, Gamson and his partner hoped on a flight to Miami and from Miami they flew to London and eventually made it to Grenada. The couple spent three days flying on seven flights and spent $2,2776. 'When I booked the trip, with British Airways, not only was I specific on city and country, but I even gave airport codes,' he said. Holiday mistake: Mr Edward Gamson always wanted to visit Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain, but he was sent to Grenada in the Caribbean . 'And I certainly had no way of anticipating that there could be a booking agent who didn’t know the difference between the West Indies and Spain.' In the aftermath of the ticketing mix up, Gamson sued British Airways for $34,000 based on the cost of the extra first class flights he paid for and the lost time in salary for when he would have been working. However, a court in Washington dismissed the case last week. British Airways told ABC News that they had tried to make up for the unfortunate error and the court was satisfied they had. 'British Airways is focused on providing exceptional service to all its customers,' the statement said. 'As a goodwill gesture we offered Mr. Gamson and his companion new flights to Granada, Spain, which they declined. 'Instead they accepted free-of-charge flights to an alternate destination and enough Avios frequent flyer points for them to book another trip in the future. 'The customers also continued to pursue a legal case against British Airways, which was dismissed by the court in Washington D.C. last week.' Gamson denies that British Airways ever made this offer. Gamson told a British newspaper in June of his disappointment: ‘I have a lifelong interest in Islamic art. I’m also of Spanish Jewish heritage so it was something I had always wanted to do to visit Granada and the Alhambra. I made it absolutely clear to the booking agent I wanted to go to Granada in Spain. Why on earth would I want to go to Grenada in the Caribbean if I was flying back to America from Lisbon? ‘It’s just so sad. A trip we had been really looking forward to was ruined and ... BA won’t do the decent thing.’","Dr. Edward Gamson and his partner thought they were going to Granada, Spain .

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . She's the ice-cool editor of the world's most influential fashion magazine and it seems style doesn't stop for Anna Wintour - even on her day off. The US Vogue editor, 64, was courtside at Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York to see her favourite tennis star Roger Federer take on Marinko Matosevic on the second day of the US Open. Never one to dress down, the ever-stylish Wintour arrived wearing an elegant green, black and cream striped frock and her trademark Manolo Blahnik sandals, all accessorised with a huge pair of sunglasses and a sparkling gold necklace. A FROW with a difference! Anna Wintour joins Michael Jordan and Mirka Federer courtside at the US Open . Stylish: Ms Wintour wore her trademark dark sunglasses and a pretty green, black and cream striped dress . And she wasn't the only famous tennis fan on court. As Ms Wintour sashayed into her seat, she was greeted by basketball legend Michael Jordan who had picked a spot for himself nearby. The unlikely pair exchanged handshakes before settling down to watch Swiss star Federer battle it out on court. His wife Mirka, sitting just in front of Ms Wintour, showed off style chops of her own courtesy of a pretty cream chiffon blouse enlivened with delicate black embroidery. But no-one could outshine Ms Wintour, who yesterday arrived wearing a knee-length dress in dramatic crimson - autumn's hottest hue.

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . An American health official has warned the deadly Ebola virus still has the upper hand in the outbreak that has killed more than 1,400 people in West Africa. During a visit to Liberia on Tuesday, Dr Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, issued the stark warning but pledged that experts would continue to try and halt the spread of the infection. Liberia along with Sierra Leone and Guinea have been hardest hit by the outbreak and Nigeria has also confirmed they too have cases but officials there have expressed optimism the virus can be controlled. Scroll down for video . People gather around a man suspected of dying from the Ebola virus, in one of the main streets on the outskirts of the city centre of  Monrovia in Liberia . Liberian security forces with riot gear stop people from leaving the West Point area, that has been hardest hit by the Ebola virus which is spreading in Monrovia . A  man, left,  rents out his wheelbarrow and moves food goods for people in the West Point area in the Liberian capital . People wait for Liberian security forces to allow them to deliver foodstuff to friends and family members in the West Point area . Speaking at a meeting attended by the Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Dr Frieden said: 'Lots of hard work is happening. Lots of good things are happening. 'But the virus still has the upper hand. 'Ebola doesn't spread by mysterious means. We know how it spreads. 'So we have the means to stop it from spreading, but it requires tremendous attention to every detail.' It comes as medical staff in protective clothing transported a patient infected with the Ebola virus from an aircraft to an ambulance in Hamburg in nothern Germany. The World Health Organisation (WHO) employee who has contracted Ebola is the first patient with the virus to be treated in the country, officials said. A plane carrying a patient infected with the deadly Ebola virus lands in Hamburg in Germany, where they will receive treatment . An ambulance drove on to the tarmac to collect the patient, who was greeted by health workers wearing protective suits . The Senegalese epidemiologist who was infected in Sierra Leone was to be taken to an isolation ward of the UKE university hospital in Hamburg. It comes as Liberia has now resorted to stringent measures to try to halt Ebola's spread but frustration has mounted over the slow collection of bodies from neighborhoods in the capital Monrovia. A group of residents even attached plastic ties to the wrists and ankles of one suspected Ebola victim and dragged his corpse to a busy street. The patient is a Senegalese epidemiologist, who was infected while working in the west African country of Sierra Leone . The patient was taken by ambulance to to the UKE university hospital in Hamburg to receive treatment . Authorities have decreed that all the dead must be collected by government health workers and cremated because contact with bodies can transmit the virus. There is no proven treatment for Ebola, so health workers primarily focus on isolating the sick. A small number of patients have received an experimental drug called ZMapp. The London hospital treating a British nurse infected in Sierra Leone, William Pooley, said he is now receiving the drug. It was unclear where the doses for Mr Pooley came from as the California-based maker of ZMapp has said its supplies are exhausted. People gather as the await a truck with food stuff from the World Food Programme, WFP,  before they enter the West Point area . Liberian security forces patrol the entrance to the area that has been hardest hit by the Ebola virus spreading, which has claimed more than 1,400 lives in West Africa . Two Americans, a Spaniard and three health workers in Liberia have received ZMapp. It is unclear if the drug is effective. The Americans have been released from the hospital, but the Spaniard died, as did a Liberian doctor. Meanwhile in Nigeria, two more Ebola patients were declared to have recovered and were released from hospital, Health Minister Onyebuchi Chukwu confirmed. Five people have died of the disease in the country, while a total of seven have recovered. One person remains in the hospital in an isolation ward, Chukwu added. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has announced that it is pulling out its team from the eastern Sierra Leonean city of Kailahun, where an epidemiologist working with the organisation was recently infected. Daniel Kertesz, the organization's representative in the country, said that the team was exhausted and that the added stress of a colleague getting sick could increase the risk of mistakes. The Ebola virus has the 'upper hand' in an outbreak that has killed more than 1,400 people in West Africa, a top American health official has said . Also, Canadian health officials said in a statement that they would evacuate a three-member mobile laboratory team in Sierra Leone after people in their hotel were diagnosed with Ebola. The outbreak is the largest on record. Doctors took a long time to identify it in a region where people are highly mobile. It has spread to densely populated areas, and many people have resisted or hid from treatment. The disease has overwhelmed the already shaky health systems in some of the world's poorest countries. According to WHO, the Ebola outbreak has killed over half of the more than 2,600 people sickened. The U.N. agency said an unprecedented 240 health care workers have been infected. A water vendor, centre, reads a warning on the door of a vehicle, left, regarding the deadly Ebola virus in Monrovia, Liberia . The agency attributed the high number of infections among health workers to a shortage of protective gear, improper use of such equipment, and a shortage of staff to treat the tremendous influx of patients. In the current outbreak, as many as 90,000 protective suits will be needed every month, according to Jorge Castilla, an epidemiologist with the European Union Commission's Department for Humanitarian Aid. He did not say how many suits were lacking. The outbreak also desperately needs more workers to trace the people the sick have come into contact with and more centers where patients can be screened for the disease in a way that contains any Ebola infections, Castilla added. Meanwhile an Ebola outbreak emerged over the weekend in Congo, though experts say it is not related to the West African epidemic. Doctors Without Borders, which is running many of the treatment centres in the West Africa outbreak, said it is sending experts and supplies to Congo but warned that the charity's resources are stretched thin.","Dr Tom Frieden issued warning while on a visit to Ebola infected countries .

"By . Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . Another hurricane is heading our way - but rather than battening down the hatches, it might be time to reach for the sunglasses. Hurricane Cristobal, which is gathering speed in the Bahamas, is forecast to narrowly miss Britain at the end of the week. Experts say it will drag an area of high pressure behind it, creating a dry, warm and sunny start to September - a welcome relief after the end-of-August washout created spectacular scenes over the Seven Sisters cliffs in Sussex. Scroll down for video . Silver lining: Hurricane Cristobal is forecast to narrowly miss Britain next week, dragging warmer weather in its wake. Pictured are the cliffs at Seven Sisters, Sussex . Storm's end: Much of Britain has been hit by miserable weather, but a rainbow shone through the gloom today on the Sussex coast . Beauty spot: The cliff range in East Sussex is one of the most visited on the south coast and is also home to the famous Beachy Head . Hurricane Cristobal taking shape over the Bahamas on August 25. It is forecast to narrowly miss Britain next week - but drag behind it warm, dry and sunny weather . The remnants of the last Caribbean storm, Hurricane Bertha, struck the UK a fortnight ago causing dramatic downpours and some flash flooding. But the tail-end of Cristobal is likely to veer north and miss us, sucking a warm air mass up from Spain and creating at least a few days of dry weather. It will come as a relief after a sodden Bank Holiday weekend and a bitterly cold week. Hurricane Cristobal, which last night whipped across the Caribbean at 75mph and dumped 4 inches (10cm) of rain on Bermuda, is expected to move up the east coast of the United States before hurtling across the Atlantic. Though showing a similar path to ex-Hurricane Bertha which caused havoc at the beginning of August, it is not expected to have anywhere near the same impact on Britain’s weather when it arrives at the weekend. According to America’s National Hurricane Centre, Cristobal will weaken to a storm as it moves towards Europe on Sunday. Divine intervention? The striking shaft of light on the East Sussex cliffs made them look almost as if they were being smiled upon from above . Idyll: The Met Office said after a generally unsettled picture this week the hurricane's tail could trigger more wind and rain in some regions in the north . Unlike Bertha, which tracked right across the UK, the remnants of Cristobal are unlikely to hit the country directly but instead veer to the north. The Met Office said after a generally unsettled picture this week it could trigger more wind and rain in some regions. Forecaster Dan Williams said: ‘We might see a bit of wind and rain in the northwest from the remnants of Cristobal on Sunday and it might get a bit breezy. ‘For many places Cristobal could bring some decent weather at the weekend by dragging high pressure towards the UK.’ MeteoGroup . spokesman Billy Payne added: ‘The latest model is that the tail-end of . the storm will go to the north of Britain on Monday over Iceland and . Scandinavia. ‘Following behind will be a region of high pressure. It will be dryer and more settled than we have seen recently. Unsettled: Horse riders take a coastal trip along The Leas in South Tyneside today, passing the red and white Souter Lighthouse under a blanket of foreboding clouds . Time to make hay? A train runs along the mainline today behind newly harvested fields near Darlington, County Durham, after more wet weather was forecast . ‘That . is likely to last through the middle and maybe the late part of next . week, when it looks sunny and dry for many, with temperatures in the low . 20s.’ Hurricane Cristobal has already caused at least five deaths in the Caribbean islands, officials said. The US National Hurricane Centre in Miami said the hurricane would likely avoid a collision with the US Eastern Seaboard, but it was creating dangerous surf and rip conditions off the coast. The Turks and Caicos cancelled flights after the hurricane dumped 12 inches (30cm) of rain on the islands over the weekend. Some 640 families in Haiti have been left homeless during the passage of the storm. Ominous: This funnel cloud appeared above caravans in Dymchurch, Kent . Holidaymakers were treated to another sign that summer could be over - a sinister-looking funnel cloud in grey skies above the seaside. The ominous shape formed yesterday above Dymchurch, Kent, on Tuesday after days of heavy rain. Described as a 'funnel cloud' because its base did not touch the ground, it forms when a combination of high winds and high humidity causes condensed water vapour to spin in a vortex. It was caught on camera by Stevie McGarrigle, who was on holiday with his two children and was stunned to see the mini storms circling above their caravan. Stevie, 39, a gardener from south east London, said: 'It had been raining for the past few days and I was just sitting outside when these mini twisters started to form. 'There were a few just sprouting up and then breaking away. It was amazing. I have never seen anything like it in my life. 'At first we were a bit scared because we thought on big one could form. I mean it was really windy and the trees were getting hammered. 'Then all of a sudden they just broke up and went away.'","Hurricane Cristobal forecast to narrowly miss Britain next week - but drag behind it warm, dry and sunny weather .

"By . John Stevens for the Daily Mail . and Alan Roden . Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling will today end their bitter feud in a desperate attempt to salvage the campaign against Scottish independence. The Labour grandees will appear together at a rally in Dundee to shore up support for Scotland remaining in the UK after Mr Darling's disastrous television debate performance. The pair fell out after the former chancellor accused the former prime minister of 'hopeless' leadership and 'appalling behaviour' during his time in Downing Street. But they are thought to have agreed an 'uneasy truce' in hope of boosting the campaign. Scroll down for video... Former British Prime Minister  Gordon Brown has made an 'uneasy truce' with Alistair Darling . The future of the 300-year-old union was thrown into doubt as First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond bounced back in the television clash on Monday night. David Cameron yesterday angered Scots after Downing Street admitted he did not watch the debate. Aides confessed the Prime Minister, on holiday in Cornwall, only watched clips and had seen only 'highlights' of the first debate earlier this month. Supporters of independence said this showed many Westminster politicians do not really care what happens to Scotland. Angus MacNeil, SNP MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (the Western Isles), said: 'The reality is that like many MPs, Mr Cameron is not really bothered what goes on in Scotland and if we leave. The only thing that bothers him is that he does not want it to happen on his watch.' A spokesman for Yes Scotland said: 'Perhaps David Cameron is distancing himself from the faltering No campaign.' A source close to Mr Salmond said: 'David Cameron may not have been paying attention, but the London establishment is now starting to wake up to the fact this referendum campaign is going right down to the wire, and it is the Yes campaign which has all the momentum.' An average 834,000 Scots watched the debate on BBC One, and a further 1.5million tuned in to BBC Two in the rest of the UK. But many are thought to have been put off by the two campaign leaders shouting over each other. 'Uneasy truce': Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling fell out after the former chancellor accused the former prime minister of 'hopeless' leadership and 'appalling behaviour' during his time in Downing Street . A snap poll found 71 per cent of those questioned thought Mr Salmond won the debate, compared with 29 per cent for Mr Darling, however it did not find a change in voting intentions. Mr Darling, leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, yesterday insisted his camp had the momentum coming out of the second and final debate. He said: 'I'm not complacent – a lot can happen in the next three weeks – but we have momentum. I've always said I thought this would be a fight right down to the wire, but I am increasingly confident.' Mr Salmond was widely seen to have needed a win in the debate to help his campaign, which has consistently lagged in the polls. He has repeatedly called for a debate between him and Mr Cameron. He said: 'Let's have the real leader of the No campaign, David Cameron. Let's see if he can do any better than Alistair Darling did. I don't think he will.' Mr Cameron, who returns from his holiday at Polzeath today, has already been accused of complacency over the Iraq crisis. Downing Street denied Mr Cameron had failed to engage with the Scottish referendum campaign. A spokesman said: 'The key moment is when people go to vote on September 18.' Mr Brown and Mr Darling's once close relationship ended when the former chancellor gave an interview in 2008 describing the financial outlook as the worst for 60 years. The pair hardly spoke to each other after Labour was kicked out of office.","Labour grandees will appear together at a Better Together rally in Dundee .

"By . Jack Crone . and Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . LL Cool J's July 31 gig at Rikers Island jail was organized by Department of Corrections officials to reward 'good behavior' by prisoners . Inmates at New York's largest jail are regularly treated to gigs by hip hop stars as a reward for 'good behavior'. LL Cool J and Treach from Naughty by Nature are among big-name rap performers to have played for convicts at the prison. The  shows, which were supposed to be kept secret, have come to light just a day after it was revealed that escape artist David Blaine performed for criminals at Manhattan Detention Complex. A source told the New York Post: 'It takes [criminals'] mind off other things.' At the LL Cool J show on July 31, young troublemakers were asked to join the star on stage. 'One inmate assisted him in back vocals on a song,' the source said. Earlier this year, Treach  also performed at the jail, which sits in the East River between Queens and the Bronx. Treach, born Anthony Criss, spent a night at a separate prison in Hudson County, New Jersey, shortly before the gig at the New York jail. A spokesman for the Department of Corrections said celebrities put on the shows for free and are brought in to give prisoners some 'positive reinforcement'. 'The Department of Correction uses positive reinforcement as one of many strategies to reduce inmate idleness and improve facility safety,' he said. 'Their appearances are geared toward violence reduction, and inmates who attend these events do so as a reward for good behavior.' Treach (centre, pictured here with rest of Naughty by Nature) from hip hop trio Naughty by Nature, also put on a show for prisoners at Rikers Island, and even stayed the night at a jail in Hudson County, New Jersey . The Rikers Island prison, only accessible by one bridge, holds up to 15,000 convicts and suspects awaiting trial . But jailhouse performances can end badly. In 2006, a Rikers Island show by rapper Papoose set off a wave of violence, including eight  stabbings. The island jail complex houses up to 15,000 inmates at any one time. Convicts held there are usually serving sentences of less than one year, along with suspected criminals who cannot afford or who have not been given bail. The jail is similar to the infamous former prison on Alcatraz Island, in San Francisco, because of its relative isolation. Rikers Island is, however, connected to the mainland by a single bridge. Johnny Cash played two shows at Folsom State Prison, California, in 1968 as a follow-up to his 1955 hit Folsom Prison Blues. A live album of the shows had sold more than three million copies by 2003. Late rapper Mac Dre recorded vocals for an album over the phone from jail in 1992 while awaiting trial. He was later sentenced to five years in prison for conspiracy to commit robbery. The Sex Pistols, who toured the U.S. in 1978 after a long battle to obtain visas, played a one-off gig at a high security prison in Chelmsford, Essex, Britain. 500 inmates enjoyed the 1976 show. English singer-songwriter Billy Bragg formed Jail Guitar Doors, an initiative to provide musical instruments to prisons to help convicts rehabilitate themselves. Yesterday it emerged that the world's most prominent illusionist, magician and escape artist, David Blaine, had performed at Manhattan Detention Complex. There were anxious faces among prison guards when David Blaine teasingly showed dangerous criminals how to break out of prison during an intimate performance. The daredevil, who usually charges around $100 for tickets, performed some of his most famous tricks in front of a crowd of prisoners including rival Bloods and Crips members, according to the New York Post. One inmate is said to have asked the 41-year-old illusionist to autograph copies of his court papers while another requested he use his powers to make the bars from his cell disappear.","LL Cool J and Treach from Naughty by Nature put on shows for convicts .

"By . Steve Nolan . and Mark Duell . Taliban terrorists who shot Malala Yousafzai in the head have threatened to attempt to kill the schoolgirl again if they get the chance. The 16-year-old survived being shot by a gunman who boarded her school bus a year ago in Swat valley after angering the terror group with her outspoken and courageous public pleas for girls to be educated. But Taliban spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said yesterday that the teenager remains a target after releasing a book about her horrific ordeal. According to the New York Post, he said: 'She is not a brave girl and has no courage. We will target her again and attack whenever we have a chance. Scroll down for video . Threat: Malala Yousafzai, who received a Pride of Britain Award from David Beckham last night, remains a Taliban target according to a spokesman for the terror group . Survivor: Malala, pictured here attending school in Brimingham, survived despite being shot in the head on her school bus in Pakistan last year . ‘She accepted that she attacked Islam . so we tried to kill her, and if we get another chance we will . definitely kill her and that will make us feel proud. ‘Islam prohibits killing women, but except those that support the infidels in their war against our religion.’ She was shot in the head close to her left eye last October after he repeated pleas for girls to be educated following a Taliban banning of girls from class in her home region of Pakistan. Despite the threat of acid attacks and abuse against girls who continued to go to school, Malala remained defiant and was determined to be educated. Education: Teenage activist Malala Yousafzai now attends Edgbaston High School for Girls in Birmingham . Opinions: Malala Yousafzi speaks last month at the official opening to the public of The Library of Birmingham . With her father Ziauddin's backing, Malala Yousafzai kept an online diary and did interviews with journalists to encourage girls to seek education - but it also made her a target. The schoolgirl has described how she told her friend not to worry before she was shot because the Taliban 'have never come for a small girl'. Her autobiography, I Am Malala, describes how the gunman fired three shots at her. In excerpts from her autobiography, published in Parade magazine, she wrote: 'Some of the girls screamed. [Best friend] Moniba tells me I squeezed her hand. 'My friends say he fired three shots. The first went through my left eye socket and out under my left shoulder. 'I slumped forward onto Moniba, blood coming from my left ear, so the other two bullets hit the girls next to me... My friends later told me the gunman's hand was shaking as he fired.' Her horrified friends recall that the Taliban asked for Malala by name before shooting straight at her head. Courage: Malala, pictured on Panorama, miraculously survived being shot in the head in Pakistan a year ago . Everything, from schoolbooks to clothes, were soaked in blood and Malala was near death. She . travelled to Britain for treatment but her injuries were so bad that . her father asked relatives to start arranging her funeral. However, Malala slowly pulled through after being transferred to an army cardiology hospital with better intensive care. She now lives in Birmingham with her family and started at Edgbaston High School for Girls in March 2013. She . has been invited to a reception for Youth, Education and the . Commonwealth, being hosted by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, at . Buckingham Palace this month. Pulling through: Malala - who now attends Edgbaston High School for Girls - was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after the bullet went through her left eye . Support: She and her family, including father Ziauddin and her two younger brothers now live in Birmingham . Her . story was featured on a Panorama special on BBC One last night, in . which she spoke of how she struggled to adjust to life in Britain. I was feeling a little bit embarrassed and worried because I didn't know how to adjust myself in the new system. ‘Drama, . music, art and PE is taught - we don't learn it in Pakistan. Here, they . don't punish students with a stick... It was difficult to adjust to . this new culture and society, especially for my mother. ‘We . have never seen that women would be that much free, that they would go . to any market. They will be going alone with no men and with no brothers . and fathers. ‘In our . country, if you want to go outside, you must go with a man - if even . your five-year-old brother goes with you it's fine, but you must have . someone else. A girl cannot go outside all alone.’ She also told the programme that UK girls take their education for granted. She received a Pride of Britain Award last night and will be seen tonight on ITV1 receiving it from David Beckham after being nominated by thousands of members of the public for standing up to terrorists. Her courage has won her many admirers around the world and she even delivered a speech to the UN on her 16th birthday. She has been invited to a reception for Youth, Education and the Commonwealth, being hosted by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, at Buckingham Palace later this month. It is thought the Queen was impressed by her bravery. Her courage has even seen her tipped for a Nobel Peace Prize.","Malala Yousafzai was shot by Taliban in Pakistan for views on education .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A massive search is underway across the Idaho wilderness for a 21-year-old student after he failed to turn up for his first day of college. After finishing his summer job in Horseshoe Bend, Idaho last Tuesday, Lucius Robbi, packed up his car and set off for the University of Montana to arrive in time for orientation for his junior year. The outdoor enthusiast had tied two orange kayaks to the top of his green 1997 Subaru Legacy and told relatives and friends he intended to drive for a while before pulling over to explore the area. Surveillance footage apparently shows his car carrying kayaks as it passed a gas station in Garden Valley, Idaho about 20 minutes after he left Horseshoe Bend on Tuesday,ABC News reported. Scroll down for video . Have you seen him? Lucius Robbi, 21, left Horseshoe Bend in Idaho last Tuesday but never arrived at the University of Montana. A massive search is now underway for the adventurous student . Vehicle: Robbi drives a green 1997 Subaru Legacy, pictured, and had attached two kayaks to the top . The last ping from his cellphone was detected in the nearby town of Lowman on Tuesday afternoon - but no one has heard from him since. 'We're very, very worried at this point,' his father Marc Robbi told ABC. His family became concerned when he failed to turn up for the orientation and contacted the Boise County Sheriff's Office. Nearby counties have also been notified. Search teams, including Idaho Mountain Search and Rescue, as well as friends and family, are now scouring the vast area, but so far, no further traces of him have been found. Searchers believe they came across footage of his car passing the gas station, although the New York Daily News reported that it only appears as if there is one kayak on top of the car. Location: A map shows where he was last seen in Idaho compared to his destination in Missoula, Montana . Active: Robbi, pictured, had worked in Idaho as a raft and kayak guide  for the past two summers . Adventurous: Friends and relatives said he planned to camp along the route to university last week . 'The mother says that's his car,' Chief Deputy Dale Rogers of the Boise County Sheriff's Office said. 'We'll go with that. My view is I didn't see two kayaks. I would probably be wondering if it was his car.' Robbi, who is from Orleans, California, has worked as a guide for Cascade Raft and Kayak in Horseshoe Bend for the past two summers and enjoys other extreme sports, including snowboarding. His mother Tina Glaessner explained: 'If anyone can survive out there for seven days, he can do it.' Kenneth Long, Robbi's supervisor at Cascade Raft and Kayak, told the Idaho Statesman that he had talked about camping along the way. His coworkers have driven along the route but have seen nothing. 'This is a very troubling and odd situation,' Long said. Spotted: Surveillance footage outside a gas station about 20 minutes into his journey shows his car, with the kayak attached, passing by last Tuesday. His cell phone was also detected shortly afterwards . Concerns: His father Marc told ABC News that he was extremely worried about his 21-year-old son . It is unknown which route Robbi took, but possibilities include Highway 21 to Stanley, Highway 75 to Challis, Highway 93 to Montana or Highway 55 to Orofino and Highway 12 to Montana, the Statesman reported. Robbi is driving a green 1997 Subaru Legacy with California license plates: 6 CCP 540. The car could have one or two kayaks on top. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Boise County Sheriff’s Office at (208) 392-4411. Friends have also launched a gofundme page to raise money for the search.","Lucius Robbi left Horseshoe Bend in Idaho last Tuesday but never arrived at the University of Montana, which is 340 miles away .

"By . Louise Eccles for the Daily Mail . Lawyers last night joined calls for the taxman not to be allowed to seize money directly from bank accounts. Building societies, accountants and small firms have already questioned whether HM Revenue and Customs can be trusted with the powers when it has a record of making mistakes. The Law Society went further by branding the debt recovery proposals as ‘draconian and regressive’. Scroll down for video . Lawyers have joined calls to stop taxman raiding our bank accounts and firms have questioned whether HM Revenue and Customs can be trusted with the powers when it already has a record of making mistakes . Spokesman Gary Richards said lawyers feared HMRC ‘has a tendency to press on even when it has not demonstrated any need for additional powers’. He added: ‘We agree that tax that is due must be paid, but HMRC’s existing powers – if properly used – are sufficient. There are already streamlined procedures for recovery of tax due in UK courts. ‘We are concerned that the direct recovery of debt from bank accounts without judicial supervision may not comply with data protection or human rights legislation.’ Outlined in George Osborne’s Budget, the plans would allow the taxman to take cash directly from a current account, joint account or Isa, without going through the courts. Around 17,000 people a year could have money seized. Gary Richards from The Law Society says lawyers feared HMRC (whose headquarters in London are pictured above) ‘has a tendency to press on even when it has not demonstrated any need for additional powers’ Plans outlined in George Osborne's budget would allow taxman to take cash and not go through courts . The scheme has been subject to a consultation that opponents said appeared to have been little more than a formality. Chas Roy-Chowdhury, of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, said the number of groups that had expressed concern should be a wake-up call for the Treasury. He added: ‘The Government must take all the objections on board rather than pushing forward with this and acting like a bull in a china shop. ‘They need to rethink the whole proposal, which we think is defective. The impression we are getting is that they will go ahead with this whatever people say, and probably before the next election.’ The Building Societies Association issued a stark warning about the proposals on Monday, saying savers might go back to storing cash under the mattress if they fear their money is not safe in the bank. It said HMRC’s record of blunders meant it could not be trusted to be ‘judge, jury and executioner’. A wide range of organisations have questioned the plans, including the Federation of Small Businesses, civil liberties charity Liberty, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the British Bankers Association. HMRC will target only those who owe at least £1,000 and who would have at least £5,000 left in their bank account after the debt is taken. Tax officials should also have contacted them at least four times. The Money Advice Trust, a debt charity, claimed the safeguards were insufficient. But an HMRC spokesman said: ‘The Direct Recovery of Debt proposals contain numerous safeguards’, and ‘will level the playing field firmly but fairly’.","Questions raised over whether HM Revenue and Customs can be trusted .

"By . Paul Harris . In a guest diary column for the Spectator, Pippa shows that she has a rather lively sense of humour . As most authors would confirm, you’re only as good as your last book. Which is probably why Pippa Middleton has been thinking hard about what she writes next. The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister, known as much for her shapely derriere as her royal connections, says she has already come up with the perfect follow-up to her book Celebrate! ‘Maybe I should write a sequel and call it Bottoms Up,’ she says in this week’s edition of The Spectator. ‘Now that could be a bestseller.’ In a guest diary column for the magazine, Pippa shows that as well as the shiny smile and glossy mane of a Middleton, she also has a rather lively sense of humour. She acknowledges that her party-planning book, which she produced in a £400,000 publishing deal, has been widely derided as a bible of the blindingly obvious. Pippa, 29, seems to know about all the jokes. And she has a few of her own to add. ‘I have been much teased for my book,’ she begins in the Spectator column. ‘Lots of journalists are saying that my advice is glaringly obvious. A spoof Twitter account called @pippatips offers such pearls as “enjoy a glass of water by getting a clean glass and pouring in water from a tap or bottle”.’ She admits the criticism is all good fun but points out that writing a guide means you have to cover the basics. ‘If I were to write a cookery book, for instance, I would be compelled to say that, to make an omelette, you have to break at least one egg. Actually, that’s not a bad idea. Or maybe I should write a sequel and call it Bottoms Up? Now that could be a bestseller.’ The Spectator, an intellectual weekly magazine first published in 1828, might not come to mind as the natural platform for the thoughts of the gal from Bucklebury, widely celebrated as a ‘rear of the year’ contender. This week, however, she joins the hallowed ranks of previous diarists including Bernard Levin, Auberon Waugh and John Betjeman. And Pippa really warms to her theme, using the spoof  Twitter account that pokes fun at her as inspiration for some Christmas entertaining tips. ‘Here.... inspired by @pippatips, are my excruciatingly self-evident tips for festive entertaining in the workplace,’ she writes. ‘1: Choose, if you can, a Christmas-themed menu. A turkey, for example, can be perfect for large gatherings. ‘2: Don’t not invite any members of staff, as this can cause offence. ‘3: Keep speeches brief and cheerful: Christmas is not a time to talk about redundancies.’ 'I have been much teased for my book,' Pippa begins in the Spectator column. Critics have said the Duchess of Cambridge's sister stated 'the obvious' with her party tips . But as well as her tongue-in-cheek advice, her column also gives a glimpse of Christmas chez Middleton, revealing that her father Michael traditionally surprises the family by wearing fancy dress. ‘A couple of Christmases ago he appeared in an inflatable sumo outfit,’ she discloses. (No prizes for guessing that   such an outfit is available for hire from the Party Pieces company the Middletons run). The column records variously that she recently landed two grilse on a fly-fishing trip in Berwickshire... that she is planning a running, cycling and kayaking triathlon in New Zealand... and that she apparently has a soft spot for Roger Federer, ‘a man who exudes so much grace and beauty that he inspires anybody with a pulse,’ as she puts it. Last night those close to Pippa insisted the Spectator article was all her own work, and that she deliberately intended to send herself up. ‘It is completely intentional and good humoured,’ a source told the Daily Mail. Yesterday Miss Middleton was hard at work at a book signing in Amsterdam for Celebrate, recently slashed to half price in some British outlets and outsold by such great works as the Highway Code and a Tom Daley calendar. In a knee-length Beulah London peplum dress the colour of a Cadbury’s Dairy Milk wrapper with matching purple suede heels, she posed in front of a store in Haarlem, stacked high with copies of her book. All these book signings have done wonders for her literacy skills, she confides in her Spectator column. ‘I have finally perfected my signature. It took hours of practising.’ After That Book, Pears Of Wisdom from Pippa .","The Duchess of Cambridge's sister pokes fun at herself in a guest column for The Spectator .

"By . Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . Up to 3.8million credit card frauds have been left out of the survey, along with murders, rapes and crimes against children . Millions of card fraud cases are left out of official figures, making a ‘mockery’ of Government figures that crime is falling, it was claimed yesterday. Damning research shows up to 3.8million bank and credit card frauds are left out of the Crime Survey for England and Wales, distorting the true scale of offending. If they were included, the number of annual offences would rise by 50 per cent, from the record low of 7.3million to 11million a year. It means seven people are defrauded every minute. For the annual survey, the Office for National Statistics conducts face-to-face interviews with 40,000 people to glean their experiences of crime. But as well as many frauds, it excludes murder and manslaughter because the victim is dead, figures about rape and other sex offences which are calculated differently due to their sensitive nature, and crimes such as drug possession that are considered victimless. The ONS was criticised last night after it revealed the 3.8million frauds were not in its survey. Card frauds alone were said to be worth £450million last year. It was accused of failing to follow new trends as criminals turn to online fraud and other cyber crimes – such as credit card fraud, bogus online auctions and online dating scams – that often carry softer punishments. But ONS statisticians said it was difficult to be confident about the scale of plastic card fraud because victims often do not report it, or it is counted twice or more by different bodies such as banks and insurers. The estimate of the scale of card and banking fraud, which would make it the second biggest area of crime after theft, was slipped out last month. Professor Marion FitzGerald, a criminologist at the University of Kent, said: ‘Ministers were readily persuaded that the Crime Survey represented a gold standard for measuring crime when it started to show a continuous fall from the time Labour took office in 1997. Yet here we have an admission from its own results that crime is 50 per cent higher than the figure it claims.’ Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘Public confidence in crime figures is vital and requires recording the full range of crimes consistently. 'It is a mockery for a reputable crime survey to fail to count almost one in three offences.’ Labour’s policing spokesman Jack Dromey said: ‘If a member of the public is robbed, online or on the street, they are robbed and that should be recorded.’ The survey showed 211,344 frauds were recorded by police in England and Wales in the 12 months to the end of March, a rise of 17 per cent. There were also 333,600 frauds reported by the financial and retail sectors. John Flatley, of the ONS, said when it began the survey in the Eighties fraud was not a high-value offence, adding: ‘With the internet, fraud has exploded. In the past it was a long process to con money out of someone.’ Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: ‘It is incorrect to suggest the Government has overlooked the scale of economic crime. We are committed to tackling fraud.’","Crime Survey data ignores rapes, murders and crimes against children .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . A sandwich firm was ordered to pay almost £5,000 for preparing meals in a factory with food-splattered walls and filthy floors. Seasons in Newcastle was found guilty of five breaches of health and safety regulations after inspectors visited its kitchens at Foundry Lane Industrial Estate. The business's owner said he 'took his eye off the ball' as workers prepared sandwiches in 'grimy' conditions. Seasons was fined thousands after council inspectors visited the site and discovered its filthy conditions . The company admitted to five different breaches of health and safety regulations including failure to ensure staff maintained a high degree of personal cleanliness . Dirty: Knives and utensils are stored in a dirty cup at the factory in Newcastle where staff failed to meet several health and safety regulations . Staff at the firm had extremely poor personal hygiene and failed to store sandwich fillings in the fridge, Newcastle Magistrates Court heard. The company admitted failing to ensure food handlers maintained a high degree of cleanliness, storing food ingredients at temperatures that might result in a risk to health, failing to maintain the floor surface and having no hazard control procedure in place. It was fined £2,500 and ordered to pay £2,140 costs in addition to a £120 victim surcharge. Business owner John Robson said the failings occurred as he 'took his eye off the ball'. Paula Davis, food safety team manager, said the company was given a number of chances after officers visited the site in August and September last year before the council decided to press ahead with a prosecution. 'General cleanliness was poor and everything was just dirty and grimy. 'Door handles and switches were grimy and when you are handling sandwiches, the risk you can pass on bacteria is quite high,' she said. John Robson, the owner of Seasons, said standards slipped when he went on holiday and 'took his eye off the ball; . A Newcastle City Council spokesman said conditions in the factory were 'unacceptable' and 'shoddy' The factory in Foundry Lane Industrial Estate (pictured) had exposed concrete floors which are difficult to clean, said officials . 'The floors were really rotten; there was exposed concrete which you can't really clean properly. 'The personal cleanliness of food handlers was also poor.' 'The manufacturer pleaded guilty but got a real shock and has since been working really closely with us. 'There is now a decent business there which is far less likely to cause any problems for people.' Councillor Stephen Powers, cabinet member for community safety and regulation at . Newcastle City Council, said: 'It was simply unacceptable for this company to be preparing food in such dirty and shoddy premises. 'I'm pleased to note that since our successful prosecution Seasons has ""upped its game"" and has now improved its practices and procedures.' John Robson, who owns the business, said: 'We have changed everything around now. 'I was on holiday at the time and I took my eye off the ball a little bit. 'Staff were totally unsupervised because I wasn't there at the time.

"By . Martin Robinson for MailOnline . Victim: Emma, now 24, (picture posed by model) who was raped every week by a paedophile ring, says she kept the clothes she was abused in but South Yorkshire Police lost the evidence and told her a prosecution was unlikely . A 13-year-old schoolgirl 'raped once a week, every week' by an Asian gang from Rotherham saved the clothing she was abused in and handed it to police but they lost the evidence and encouraged her to drop the case, it emerged today. Emma was forced to drop the charges after officers told her it was 'her word against theirs' and it was unlikely her attackers would ever end up in court. After two years of countless rapes her parents, who made persistent complaints to South Yorkshire Police and Rotherham Council, sent her abroad so she could escape her abusers once and for all. Emma, now 24, was one of 1,400 victims habitually abused by  men in the town – almost all of them of Pakistani origin - and many of the paedophiles are still walking the streets, she said. Police treated the victims with contempt, turning a blind eye to their plight and in many cases holding them responsible. No officers or council employees have faced disciplinary action. Emma believes she was initially targeted because she was a virgin and suffered two years of violent sex attacks because detectives refused to protect her. 'They (the gang) started introducing alcohol and soft drugs and then at 13 I was sexually exploited by them', she told the BBC's Today programme. 'I had never had a boyfriend or anything and one man singled me out. I thought we were friends but then the main perpetrator raped me quite brutally in front of a number of people. 'From then on I was raped once a week, every week. Then they made me have sex with whoever who wanted to have sex with me. 'I reported it to police after three months of sexual exploitation started. I'd saved all my clothes I had been raped in and gave it to police as evidence. ‘But they lost the clothing so there was no evidence and said it was my word against his and said it wouldn't result in a conviction or make it to court. ‘The men were parking outside my house and threatening my family and the police said they couldn't offer any protection so I dropped the charges'. Crimes: Emma was one of 1,400 children from Rotherham abused on an industrial scale in the town, pictured . Emma's case contains a common threat as the majority of the girls suffered vicious threats of violence against them and their families stopped them going to the police. Some were ‘doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight, threatened with guns, made to witness brutally violent rapes and threatened they would be next if they told anyone’, the shocking report said. Emma said 'My sexual exploitation went on until I was 15 as the authorities so my parents decided the best thing to do was move me out of the country. 'What we have heard there are a lot of young people who suffered the same because these people were able to walk the streets and go unpunished'. She was asked why her parents could not prevent her from leaving the house and falling into the clutches of the sex ring. She said: ''My parents locked me up as many others did. Locked them in bedrooms and the house to stop them going out. I went out because I had no choice because they threatened to get my mum, to gang rape her. They gang raped me why wouldn't they do that to her. They used to follow her, knew where she went at one time'. South Yorkshire Police told MailOnlline: 'An initial allegation of rape was made, but later withdrawn. After the complaint was withdrawn, four items of clothing, two coats and two pairs of trousers, could not be found to be returned to the girl. South Yorkshire Police paid £140 to the complainant for the loss of property. 'A second allegation of rape was made in 2003.

"By . Spencer Matthews For Mailonline . I have given in to an overwhelming number of requests to take the ALS Ice Bucket challenge. Bad timing really given that summer is now officially over and the country has avoided autumn this year and has instead jumped straight to freezing cold winter. Just for anyone who has been living in a cave for the past month, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge is charity campaign to raise awareness and money to aid research into Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or as we call it here in the UK, motor neurone disease. Scroll down for video . Spencer was nominated by singer/charity campaigner Stacey Jackson, Rick Parfitt Jnr and Jamie Laing . The challenge is very simple, you video . yourself having a bucket of icy water thrown over your head and then you . nominate three friends that then have to do the same within 24 hours. My . latest nomination was from singer/charity campaigner Stacey Jackson, . but there have been several others, notably Rick Parfitt Jnr and Jamie . Laing. So far the challenge has raised £48m pounds for research into . the disease which affects the brain and the spinal cord causing motor . neurons to die and leads to gradual paralysis and eventually death. There . is no known cure for this terrible disease and seeing as I am a TV . personality and not a neurosurgeon, the best thing I thought I could do . to help was to throw a bucket of icy water over my head. If you are . thinking of doing this challenge then please do it properly. Pick a . container large enough to bathe a small child. There needs to be much . more than a couple of pints of freezing cold water - please note Simon . Cowell and Stacey Jackson - perhaps you would both care to do it again? Bill Gates and David Beckham did much better - both chose very decent sized containers of chilly water. A barman at Meursault prepared a huge Jeroboam bucket filled with a 50/50 mix of ice and water . When . I took my challenge I was doing a PR job for EA's latest game Sims 4 . and I was at a very high-end club called Meursault on Gloucester Road. The . barman picked out a wine cooler which contained barely over a pint, I . refused. Then a champagne bucket, still not big enough, then a magnum . cooler, I pointed towards the rather huge Jeroboam bucket. The . bartender added a 50/50 mix of ice and water. I sat out on the pavement . outside as the club didn't really want two gallons of icy cold water . poured all over the floor just before their lunch-time service started. Then the world's coldest wet T-shirt competition began. It's not the . first time I've had a cold drink thrown over me, as viewers of Made In . Chelsea will know, but this time at least it was for a good cause. And . now I have nominated Hugo Taylor, Caggie Dunlop and Lucy Watson to do . their challenge in 24 hours, so let's see if they can handle it.

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . William Hayden, 49, was arrested on Tuesday and charged with the rape of an 11-years-old girl . Reality show 'Sons of Guns' has been cancelled following the arrest of star William Hayden on child rape charges. In a statement to TMZ on Wednesday, a Discovery channel spokesman wrote: 'Given the serious and horrific nature of the charges against Will Hayden, we have decided to halt further production of Sons of Guns and cancel the series.' The series focused on the custom firearm store in Louisiana that Hayden founded. Hayden was arrested yesterday and  charged with the aggravated rape of a girl who was just 11-years-old at the time of the alleged offence. The 49-year-old was apprehended as a fugitive on Tuesday in Livingston Parish, Louisiana, two weeks after being accused of child molestation, according to East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office. The girl is now backing up the allegations and says she was orally and vaginally raped almost daily, but did not report it because he threatened her physically. She told investigators that Hayden took her virginity in March 2013 when she was 11-years-old. The alleged victim did not want to disclose any information at first because Hayden allegedly intimidated her and said: ‘Don't tell them nothing, because I'm all you got.' Hayden, a former Marine whose show airs on the Discovery Channel, was also arrested on August 9 for child molestation. But he insisted that the claims were the work of a bitter ex-girlfriend who told authorities that he had molested the girl to get back at him for breaking up with her. The gun store owner posted $150,000 bond the same day and was released, according to the sheriff's website. When the case was sealed by a judge, Hayden told TMZ that his ex-girlfriend, who is mother to one of his daughters, went to authorities and accused him of molesting the girl. Scroll down for video . Hayden (second left) is the star of Sons of Guns, which first aired on Discovery in 2011. It follows Hayden's company, which manufactures and sells custom guns in Louisiana . Sons of Guns first aired on the Discovery Channel in 2011 and follows Hayden's life at the helm of a gun store, Red Jacket Firearms, in Louisiana. It is not his first brush with the law, as Hayden was investigated in 2009 over ten unregistered guns by the U.S. Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Relatives filed a lawsuit against him in 2013, claiming he and his ex-wife had previously given them shares in the company - before transferring part of the company to a new name and rendering the shares worthless. But his attorney argued that he had transferred some of the business to comply with the ATF and federal regulations regarding automatic firearms and had never intended to deceive anyone.","William Hayden, 49, arrested yesterday for the rape of an 11-year-old girl .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . A woman who was depressed, had poor skin and was lacking in self-esteem due to her size has shed the pounds and turned her life around. Shelly Bannister lost 14in from her waist, 7in off her hips and slimmed down from 16st 5lbs to just over 13st by following a gruelling diet and fitness regime for seven weeks. Car worker Shelly, 25, had reached rock bottom in May when she registered for a gastric band operation. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Shelly Bannister, pictured on arrival at boot camp, left, and at the end of her seven-week stint, right, lost 14in off her waist, 7in off her hips and slimmed down from 16st 5lbs to just over 13st by following a gruelling diet and fitness regime for seven weeks . At the last minute she changed her mind, quit her job and enrolled at No.1 Boot Camp in Norfolk. The seven-week stay wasn't cheap at £4,699 but she says the camp's healthy food and military-style training run by ex-Special Forces experts turned her life around. Shelly said: 'I was just eating poorly - lots of convenience foods. At 5ft 2in, I don't carry extra weight well. 'After steadily gaining weight through my teenage years and trying every diet there is to do and failing, I decided something had to change. 'I had become depressed and anxious and felt unwell all the time. I just didn't enjoy anything anymore and needed to get my health and weight under control. 'I booked an appointment to get a gastric band and that's when I thought to myself, ""What am I doing?"". 'I had become that desperate that I was willing to put myself through an operation - this wasn't right.' Slimming down: Shelly considered a gastric band operation but at the last minute she changed her mind, quit her job and enrolled at a gruelling military-style bootcamp to turn her life around . Bold move: She took the drastic step of quitting her job and signing up to boot camp for seven long weeks and says it has completely changed her life . Knock-on effect: Shelly, who has a history of skin problems, says her face has never been clearer since embarking on her new lifestyle . Shelly knew she had to break out the vicious cycle that she found herself in - and the only option was a complete lifestyle reboot. She took the drastic step of quitting her job and signing up to boot camp for seven long weeks. Shelly, who lives with her boyfriend in Wythall, near Birmingham, explained: 'I quit my job not knowing how soon I would be able to get another one or if I even had enough money to pay my bills, but I finally decided my health needed to be more important than anything else. 'The first week was hell. I ached in places I didn't know possible and I thought, ""What have I done?"".' Tough times: Shelly knew she had to break out the vicious cycle that she found herself in - and the only option was a complete lifestyle reboot and while it wasn't easy, it has certainly paid off . Challenge: Shelly said that her first week at bootcamp was 'hell' and that she ached in places she didn't even know possible . She continued: 'All these fears soon disappeared, though, when I stepped on the scales at my first weigh in and I had lost 11lbs and 5in off my waist. I couldn't believe it and couldn't wait to carry on. 'Over the seven weeks I could feel myself getting fitter. My skin was clear for the first time in years and I was sleeping much better. I have been taught so much about nutrition that I feel confident I can go home and continue my journey and know what to eat and where I have been going wrong previously. 'I've regained my health, happiness and confidence, which is worth more than anything and I have even got my job back. 'The most shocking moment was seeing my before and after pictures. I couldn't believe the difference. I did not think I would achieve this much in such a short period of time. I will never go back to the unhealthy, overweight person I was before.' Gruelling: The bootcamp is run in a military style by ex-army officers and is a firm favourite of Made In Chelsea stars Spencer Matthews and Binky Felstead .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . The French Prime Minister has reshuffled his cabinet to silence critics of socialist President Francois Hollande's economic policies. Emmanuel Macron, who previously served as a top economic advisor, now heads the Economy Ministry, replacing Arnaud Montebourg, who railed against 'unjust' government policies. Macron, a 36-year-old former banker who advised Hollande until June 2014, is known for his pro-business stance. Scroll down for video . Emmanuel Macron, 36, a former banker known for his pro-business stance, has replaced Arnaud Montebourg as head of the Economic Ministry in a move designed to silence critics of President Hollande . His appointment by Prime Minister Manuel Valls will send a strong message to the EU that France is serious about getting its finances in order after years of stagnation. Education Minister Benoit Hamon and Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti, who supported Montebourg in attacking the government, also lost their jobs. Hamon was replaced by Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, the former sports and youth minister, and Filippetti was replaced by Fleur Pellerin, former minster for commerce and tourism. Yet, Finance Minister Michel Sapin, Foreign Affairs Minister Laurent Fabius and Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian stayed in place in the limited reshuffle. The reshuffle comes less than five months after Mr Valls took office, promoting Hollande's agenda. The changes are aimed at creating a Cabinet that embodies Hollande's policies, seen as too far to the right by some Socialists. Mr Montebourg (left) had criticised Mr Hollande's policies as being too right wing, and was backed by Education Minister Benoit Hamon (right), who has also been removed from his post . Prime Minister Manuel Valls (right) is a staunch backer of Hollande (left) and has created a cabinet which reflects his policies, seen as too right-wing for some . In addition to the ousted ministers, dozens of other Socialists are believed to consider Hollande's economic policies a betrayal of the party's cause. Mr Valls on Tuesday said any debate 'should be held within the government.' 'There is a single (policy) line and members of the government cannot make a spectacle,' Valls said in a TV interview on France-2 TV. 'I have a single mission ... to set the country aright,' he added. The French president asked all the ministers to swear their loyalty to the government line or to leave the Cabinet, a top government official said. France, the second largest economy in the eurozone, has had no growth this year. Hollande is the most unpopular president in recent French history, with ratings below 20 percent. He has promised to lower the country's 10 percent jobless rate, cut the deficit, and rekindle growth as well as cutting 50 billion euros ($29 billion) in state spending by 2017.","Economy, Education and Culture ministers all lose their jobs in reshuffle .

"By . Paul Newman for MailOnline . The gloom that led to the abandonment of the first one-day international in Bristol on Monday was matched when England’s World Cup hopes were written off by two star ex-players. Michael Vaughan, captain of the fabled 2005 Ashes-winning side, and spinner Graeme Swann, who retired when the Ashes were lost last winter, were damning in their condemnation of England’s one-day cricket in an animated conversation on BBC’s Test Match Special as rain lashed Nevil Road. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Joe Root's defence of Alastair Cook . Don't bother: Former England cricketer Graeme Swann poses with the ICC Cricket World Cup trophy in Bristol . Stern: Swann says 'I love Alastair Cook dearly but I don't think he should be bothering playing one-day cricket' Both believe England might as well not bother turning up in Australia and New Zealand next year, so poor are their chances of winning a first World Cup. They also feel Alastair Cook should give up the 50-over captaincy. Swann, who believes England are too influenced by statistics, said: ‘I always felt we were so far behind the other one-day teams because we play such an old-fashioned brand of cricket. ‘Some of my best mates — Cook, Bell and Ballance — are not one-day players who are going to win you a World Cup. I love Alastair Cook dearly but I don’t think he should be bothering to play one-day cricket. He doesn’t need to. He’s made a very good point in Tests and he should leave one-day cricket to young people who can smash it everywhere and win you a World Cup. ‘We won’t win this one, there’s no chance, but in four years we might if we get all these exciting players without any baggage into the team. Swann advocated the inclusion of James Vince, James Taylor and Jason Roy in England’s 50-over team. ‘I’d say Eoin Morgan would be the ideal captain of the one-day side,’ he added. No chance? Cook should relinquish one-day cricket because England don't have 'a cat in hell's chance' Unneccesary: Cook ‘doesn’t need to' play one-day cricket anymore and 'made a very good point in Tests' Vaughan, who was critical of the omission of Ravi Bopara from this series, was equally trenchant about what he sees as England’s conservatism in limited-overs cricket . He even said the selectors should have dropped him rather than let him captain the side at the ill-fated 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean. ‘We’ve made the same mistake now that we made in my time,’ said Vaughan. ‘We’re picking one-day squads on Test form. You need power at the top, in the middle and at the end now. It’s completely different because of Twenty20. I look at Alastair Cook and he has proven all the critics wrong in the Tests. I was wrong. But he’s been playing since he was 21 and this would have been the perfect time to move over in one-day cricket and have a real good break. ‘He will do half a job as a batsman and I don’t think he’ll win games for England as a tactician in one-day cricket. ‘Your captain has to perform and be a star player in the side. ‘I thought this was going to be the series where we were going to be a bit risky and pick a younger set of players who could strike at 89 and 95 (runs per 100 balls) and do some real damage.’ Had his say: Michael Vaughan admits Cook proved him wrong but says England's one-day game is unncessary .

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . Distressing photos show a toddler boy strapped to his nap cot at a Texas daycare that is currently under investigation for child abuse. The saddening photos were taken at Heart2Heart Montessori Cchool by teacher Hannah Tidwell, who witnessed facility owner Pamela Decker carrying out the abusive act on a 2-year-old boy. Tidwell then sent the pictures to the boy's parents, Kristi and Brad Galbraith, saying their son was one of two boys and a little girl restrained during nap time. The Star-Telegram reports that when Tidwell confronted Decker about the act, she said:  'Do not say anything about this. I know this [is] illegal but felt it was necessary.' Scroll down for video . Confined: A day care in Texas is under investigation for child abuse charges after pictures were taken, showing two boys strapped to their nap mats with duct tape . Abuse: Heart2Heart Montessori co-owner Pamela Decker is the woman accused of carrying out the distressing act . Now the Galbraiths are suing the school and Decker, seeking damages between $200,000 and $1million. 'I feel like this should never happen to any child,' Mrs Galbraith told NBC Dallas/Fort Worth. 'I was angry, I was shocked, I felt an extreme amount of guilt about how I could have chosen a place that would do this to my child.' Shocked: Kristi Galbraith pulled her son, one of the toddlers pictured, out of the school immediately after seeing the evidence . After informing Child Protective Services about the duct-tape incident, Tidwell elaborated on other abusive actions she witnessed at the child care center. She said one other child had been left alone in a room, and that kids were denied water throughout the day to reduce diaper changes. The Galbraiths immediately pulled their son out of the school after seeing the pictures, and started informing other parents of the alleged abuse. When they confronted Decker about the incident, she initially 'appeared to shrug off the accusation as implausible,' according to the lawsuit. 'It was only after the Galbraiths advised her that they had copies of photographs of their son duct taped to the nap mat that Ms Decker became visibly shaken; not distraught with what she had done but rather distressed that she had been caught,' the suit states. Torri Almquist's son was one of the other children strapped to a bed, and she was contacted by Decker before hearing from other parents. According to the lawsuit, Decker called Almquist and told her that Tidwell was spreading false accusations about her because she was 'pregnant and hormonal'. She admitted to using duct tape on the boys but said the Galbraiths were blowing the whole incident out of proportion. Open: The day care remains open, pending the investigation, but with far fewer students. The day care previously issued a statement saying they are cooperating with investigators . She told Almquist 'that she did something ""incredibly stupid and one of the dumbest things she had ever done"" and decided to duct tape her son and the other little boy to their nap mats. 'Decker apologized to Ms Almquist and advised her that other parents ""were freaking out"" and that the Dad of the other little boy had sent out a ""big email,"" ' the lawsuit reads. Decker then held a school meeting on June 19 where she described the incident, saying she had tried several times to get the boy down for a nap and then made a 'very foolish decision' to place a strip of duct tape across his blanket. 'He was quiet. He never cried. He never complained. He was not in any anguish. … He was not harmed in any way, emotionally, physically, at all,' Decker allegedly told the parents, according to the lawsuit. Victims: Lorri Almquist's son was also strapped to a nap mat. She says she is also looking into her legal options . She called it 'stupid' and 'inappropriate' and claimed the duct tape was only touching the blanket and not actually holding the child down. In the images, that's clearly not the case. She also said she self-reported herself to the center's director and Child Protective Services but attorneys say that reporting only happened after she found out about the photos. The day care center is currently under investigation by local police and the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. Evidence will be presented to a grand jury later this week, according to a Willow Park Police spokesman. Child Protective Services plans to wrap up their investigation this week as we;. The day care remains open, pending the investigation, but with far fewer students. They previously issued a statement, saying they are cooperating 'fully' with the investigation.","In June, a teacher at Heart2Heart Montessori School snapped pictures of toddlers strapped with duct tape to a nap mat .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . A mother and her five children were badly burned after a gas leak caused their house to explode. Sanjuanita Rodriguez and her five children, aged between three and 18, climbed out of the front window of their Dallas house early yesterday morning and were all taken to hospital with injuries. Firefighters were called to a single-story home in Oak Cliff, Texas, at 6.05am and when they arrived the home was engulfed in flames, according to Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans. Scroll down for video . A gas leak is thought to have caused the house explosion in Dallas that injured a woman and five children . Sanjuanita Rodriguez and her five children, aged between three and 18, climbed out of the front window of their house in Texas and were all taken to hospital badly burned and with other injuries . Speaking from Parkland Memorial Hospital, Mrs Rodriguez said that everyone is alright, but that they lost everything in the fire. 'I'm grateful to God no one died in that fire,' she said. The mother's condition appeared to be the most severe, with burns covering most of her body, according to officials. Her husband, Martin, was working at a nearby store when the house exploded and burst into flames. Mrs Rodriguez said that everyone is alright, but that they lost everything in the fire. She said: 'I'm grateful to God no one died in that fire' Their 11-year-old son has already has surgery for the burns and his 17-year-old brother was in a critical condition. An eight-year-old girl has burns on her hands and an 18-year-old man has burns to his legs, but the three-year-old girl escaped with the least severe injuries. Neighbours reported smelling gas in the hours before the explosion and said they rushed outside after hearing a loud boom to find the home on fire. Sara Rodriguez, 13, was standing in her kitchen making a sandwich when she heard an explosion. The teenager, who is not related to the victims, grabbed her mobile phone and started recording the inferno as she raced outside. 'I saw people screaming, yelling and I was like shocked,' she said. The mother's condition appeared to be the most severe, with burns covering most of her body . 'It sounded like  a bomb or something. It came towards us.' One neighbour said he saw all six family members climb out of the window and that one of the boys pulled his sister out of the house just before he heard a second explosion. Howard Jenkins said: 'His oldest son managed to get his sister out of the front window. Everybody got out that window. 'When they made it across the street, the house exploded. It was a matter of seconds. If they hadn't gotten out of there when they did we wouldn't have just had legs burned.' 'We woke up to a loud explosion. We thought a car hit a pole. When we came out, we saw the house engulfed.' A Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman said the Tuesday morning blast was accidental in nature and resulted from a leak inside the house.","Sanjuanita Rodriguez and her five children were all burned in the Dallas fire .

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . Death: Daniel Gliksten vanished in the early hours of New Year's Day near Budapest's Chain Bridge . The death of a British medical student who vanished during New Year's Eve celebrations in Hungary's capital is set to remain a mystery. Daniel Gliksten, 23, was found dead in the River Danube almost three months after he vanished near Budapest's Chain Bridge in the early hours of January 1 last year. The first-year student's devastated mother Cecilia Gliksten, 57, who run the 1,200-acre Denham Estate near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was among thousands who joined a frantic search which included the British and Swedish embassies. She flew to the Hungarian capital with other relatives as a Facebook search group gained almost 2,000 members. But the hunt ended in tragedy when the body of Mr Gliksten, who held dual British and Swedish nationality, was found almost three months later some miles downstream. This week an inquest into the student's death was held in his home county of Suffolk, but ruled the mystery of how he vanished was unlikely to ever be solved. Suffolk coroner Dr Peter Dean said post-mortem examination tests showed Mr Gliksten had drowned, most likely two to three months before his body was discovered. He said there was no suggestion of anyone else being involved in the student's death, but there was no firm evidence about how he came to be in the water. Dr Dean told the hearing in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk: 'We have a very sad situation where Daniel has clearly gone missing. 'This may well have been a tragic accident... But we simply don’t have any eyewitness accounts of that and the only conclusion I can draw is an open conclusion.' The student's friend Anna Oláh, who submitted a report to police about his disappearance, saw him for the last time at 2am and he was captured near the bridge on CCTV shortly afterwards. Scroll down for video . Final sighting: CCTV images released by police in Budapest captured the student just after 2am in the early hours of New Year's Day 2013. He vanished and his body was only recovered from the River Danube in March . Daniel’s remains were found months later by horrified passer-by Gyula Kukucska, the inquest heard. Ms Oláh recognised the pair of trousers, belt and set of keys on the body and other marks in the description of Daniel were also identified. Taken with the post-mortem examination findings and dental records and images, it was possible to identify the deceased person as 'highly likely' to be Daniel, the inquest heard. Dr Dean said some alcohol was in his blood, but no 'great evidential weight' could be placed on it because of the decomposition of the body. Mr Gliksten was a popular former pupil at the £20,000-a-year Culford School near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Landmark: The chain bridge (foreground) is one of the central sights in the historic city, near the Parliament . He left for Semmelweis University in Budapest to realise his ambition of studying medicine. His  father Michael, a former director of Charlton Athletic FC who died in 2009, bought the rambling Denham Estate from the Land Settlement Association in 1980. It boasts one of the largest fallow deer populations in the country, and together with the student's Swedish mother the businessman supplied London restaurants and Cambridge colleges with venison for 20 years. The sprawling farm also produces wheat, barley, oilseed rape, maize and spring barley and has a rare breed sheep, the Denham Castle lamb, which is unique to it. The coroner recorded an open verdict. Mrs Gliksten was too upset to comment on her son's death following the hearing.","Daniel Gliksten vanished in Budapest, Hungary, on New Year's Day 2013 .

"By . James Rush for MailOnline . This spectacular photo captured from the International Space Station shows the full extent of the size of Hurricane Marie as it bears down on the West Coast, causing dangerous swells near the beaches of Southern California. While the hurricane was weakening over colder water today, with its sustained winds decreasing compared to Sunday, a low-lying street in Seal Beach was still inundated by a surge of rising seawater. Police Sgt. John Scott says several homes and garages were flooded early Wednesday. Flooding is also reported to the north in Long Beach.

The National Weather Service has said beaches stretching 100 miles up the Southern California coast would see large waves. The hurricane's winds however had decreased to near 85mph early today from a peak of 160mph on Sunday. Marie, centred about 810 miles west of the southern tip of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula and moving west-northwest near 13 mph, was expected to slump to tropical storm force later today. Seal Beach resident Blanca Dubonbrown told City News Service how she woke up late yesterday to find her bedroom under three inches of water. Several of her neighbors in ground floor apartments also experienced flooding. Marine Safety Chief Joe Bailey says crews are trying to dig a channel to allow water that had breached a beach wall to drain back into the ocean.

Residents shelter from heavy rain brought by Hurricane Marie, in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco state, Mexico, over the weekend . Coastal areas in Southern California were yesterday filling sandbags and building sand berms to ward against possible flooding from the potentially damaging surf spawned by Marie. A large southerly swell was expected to produce large waves, rip currents and strong longshore currents in Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. 'These areas will potentially see the largest surf seen in recent years, with breakers of 10 to 15 feet possible,' a Weather Service advisory had said. Swimmers and surfers were urged to be aware of dangerous conditions, and minor coastal flooding and beach erosion is possible, forecasters said. In the city of Long Beach's Peninsula neighborhood, residents watched as bulldozers built huge sand berms between the ocean and their homes. Several took the warning to heart and shovelled sand into bags to place around their garage doors and entryways.","Image taken from International Space Station shows  Hurricane Marie as it spins off the coast of Mexico .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . A woman trying to raise money for charity by completing the ice bucket challenge has seen the cruel side of the online craze after being soaked in manure instead of water. Jamie Cowling, a farmer's daughter, thought she would be drenched in water from a high pressure hose when filming her effort at a farm in Somerset. But the 30-year-old's cruel brothers soaked her with slurry, after filling the tank with hundreds of gallons of waste. Scroll down for video . Jamie Cowling thought she was going to be sprayed with water but was instead given a shower of manure . After realising she is being sprayed by slurry, the mother-of-one makes a run for it but is quickly followed by her brothers' hose . Not one to have her spirit dampened, Miss Cowling hopes the practical joke will raise more money for charity. 'I got nominated by my sister and she had a tractor bucket full of ice-cold water dumped on her, and I wanted to do something different. 'My brothers told me they had filled the tanker with water - and stupidly I believed them. 'The plan was my partner was going to dump a bucket of water over my head first, so I was preparing for that when I literally got blown off my feet. 'I knew straight away it was slurry. 'I have grown up on a farm with three brothers and two sisters so I'm used to pranks. 'If it makes a few people smile, I'm fine with that.' The mother-of-one had gone to the family's farm in Dinder, near Shepton Mallet for a party on Bank Holiday Monday. Bare foot, she stood in front of a camera as her partner, Matthew Keen, stood nearby with a bucket. After falling to the ground (left) Miss Cowling is then soaked by a bucket of water her partner was holding on the sidelines (right) The mother-of-one is able to see the funny side of the prank and hopes it will help raise money for charity . Little did she know her brothers had already filled the tanker with waste, and were standing guard armed with a hose pipe. The video - which has already been viewed more than 3,000 times - shows Miss Coward talking to the camera in the rain about how she chose to be blasted with water. She said: 'At least growing up on a farm I'm used to being out in this weather, and at least it is water and not s***' Her family can be heard laughing as she is knocked to the ground - with Mr Keen adding his bucket of water for good measure. 'I was laughing straight away. 'I was power-washed off with the parlour hose first, and to be honest it was worse than the slurry - it was freezing cold. 'Then I went for a shower. And another one.' The challenge holds a special place in Miss Cowling's heart as it raises money for Motor Neurone Disease, an illness suffered by her late grandfather. The young man speaks to the camera before chasing the older man who is in a wheelchair with a bucket of water . He pours the water over the man's head despite his shouting before running away, filming the older man wheeling off . 'I know first-hand it's a disgusting disease,' she said. 'If we can help raise awareness then that's great - anything that's helping.' While Miss Cowling's brothers acted in jest, another shocking video has emerged of a yob throwing water over a man in a wheelchair. Speaking to the camera, the youth says he is going to soak the man in a wheelchair in the footage believed to have been shot in Manchester. He is then seen chasing after him as the distressed disabled man tries to wheel himself away. Laughter from the person filming the exchange can be heard. He dumps a bucket of water over the man's head at which point he slows down.","Jamie Cowling prepared to do ice bucket challenge in rain at farm .

"By . Alex Greg for MailOnline . Time Warner Cable is experiencing widespread outages nationwide. Customers began to register their displeasure with the network in the early hours of Wednesday morning, posting Twitter updates tagged with #timewarnercable from coast to coast. Time Warner Cable released a statement on the outage. 'At 4:30am ET this morning during our routine network maintenance, an issue with our Internet backbone created disruption with our Internet and On Demand services.' The company's own website was down for a time as they worked to restore service. Angry customers: Time Warner Cable customers took to Twitter to vent their displeasure . Widespread: The outages were reported from coast to coast from the early hours of Wednesday morning . 'We're working to restore services to all areas as quickly as possible; no ETR. Tweets will be delayed while this is addressed,' the company tweeted. It's unclear what caused the outage. The outages have affected major cities including Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Tampa and Houston, according to the site Down Detector. Customers reported busy signals on customer service hotlines and there was a peak of about 10,000 complaints at 6am. Many outraged customers believe the outage is a sign of things to come with Comcast's proposed $45 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable. Affected: There are still several areas experiencing outages, though Time Warner Cable says service is largely restored . A letter signed by Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti expressed his concern about the takeover's benefits for Los Angelenos. 'Without strong commitments to tangible benefits, there is a risk that the merged company may not deliver excellent products and services to Los Angeles consumers, or that the public interest will suffer,' wrote Garcetti.

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . Kate Bush fans have ignored the singer's requests to not film her performances during her 22-date tour by uploading photographs and videos from the opening night to social media. The pop idol had told fans it would 'mean a great deal' to her if those attending her shows at London's Hammersmith Apollo refrained from using iPhones, iPads or cameras. However, footage emerged on Twitter and YouTube this morning of last night's performance - the opening night of the tour which was attended by a host of celebrities including Lily Allen, Gemma Arterton and Frank Skinner. Kate Bush had asked fans not to film or take photos at her show, claiming it would 'mean a great deal' to her. However, several videos and photos emerged on Twitter and YouTube this morning of the star in action (above) Some fans had criticised the Wuthering Heights singer for making the 'no filming' request ahead of her tour . One video shows the 56-year-old singer swaying from side-to-side on stage as she performs Cloudbusting – the final song of the night – while another, taken from near the back of the venue, is of Among Angels. Popstar and mother-of-two Lily Allen also posted a photograph of the stage before Bush made her grand entrance. Captioning the picture simply with 'K8', Allen's image shows the stage lit up ahead of the Wuthering Heights singer's first stage performance in 35 years. Several fans have hit out at those who uploaded the content, blasting them for not respecting the singer's wishes. Writing on her website earlier this month, Bush said: 'I have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows. We have purposefully chosen an intimate theatre setting rather than a large venue or stadium. 'It would mean a great deal to me if you would please refrain from taking photos or filming during the shows. I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras. 'I know it's a lot to ask but it would allow us to all share in the experience together.' Today, one fan wrote under the video of last night's performance: 'Poor video, poor audio, why did you bother? And isn't this typical of the selfish world we find ourselves in; no respect for others' wishes at all.' However, while some fans blasted those who uploaded footage to social media, others condemned the star for making the request in the first place. Some fans blasted those who posted footage online while others criticised the star for making the request . The grainy footage was taken by one audience member of the 4,000-strong crowd at the Hammersmith Apollo . One user, MagratheaLegend, wrote: 'Banning all photography/filming in this day and age, I thought she had mellowed from all that egocentric nonsense. ' Meanwhile, Julia Greenwood said: 'I respectfully disagree with Kate's request, much as I love her, because even now, I'm not sure she truly understands how much people love her and would do anything to see her live. 'I tried like the dickens to get tickets but was unable. So should I be condemned forever after to never, ever see her perform? Seems unduly harsh and most un-Kate-like to me.' Another fan added : 'Thank you so so much for sharing this video. 'Not like most of you, I knew about Kate only four years ago and obviously became one of her fans. 'I'm only 17 and I feel so lucky, lucky enough to see her on stage like this for the first time because I couldn't afford the tickets.' Last night's show kicked-off the 22-date tour at the Hammersmith Apollo, which was chosen because it was the venue of her last gig on May 14, 1979 - when it was known as the Hammersmith Odeon. Around 80,000 tickets for the Before The Dawn residency sold out within 15 minutes when put on sale earlier this year. The video footage goes against the star's wishes, who asked for no iPhones, iPads or cameras to be present . One video shows the 56-year-old singer swaying from side-to-side on stage as she performs Cloudbusting . The singer is not the first musician to criticise gig-goers who spend their time using their mobile devices rather than watching the show. Roger Daltrey, The Who frontman, recently said it was 'weird' that people seemed to spend more time on their phones than watching a show. He said: 'I feel sorry for them, I really feel sorry for them. Looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally - if you're doing that, you're 50 per cent there, right? It's weird. I find it weird.' Performance artist Marina Abramovic also recently barred visitors to her exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London from bringing in their devices, so they could focus more on the art she was creating. Critics described the opening show as 'spellbinding' as Bush took to the stage for the first time in 35 years . The 56-year-old singer kicked-off her 22-date residency at Hammersmith Apollo in West London last night . Bush's return to the stage after 35 years went down a storm with critics and fans alike, who hailed her performance as 'spellbinding'. The first night saw the singer, accompanied by backing singers and a seven-strong band, open with Lily, followed by songs including Hounds Of Love and Running Up That Hill. Comeback queen Kate Bush has taken the charts by storm with no fewer than 11 of her albums featuring in today's midweek Top 100. Three of her classic singles have also re-entered the charts. It comes after the enigmatic singer made a triumphant return to the stage after 35 years in front of a star-studded crowd at the Hammersmith Apollo last night. Critics hailed her show a stunning success and her performance made headlines around the world. Now her hits collection, The Whole Story, is hovering inside the Top 10 of the album charts at Number 6, while five more - Hounds Of Love (13), The Sensual World (25), 50 Words For Snow (31), The Kick Inside (35) and The Dreaming (37) are also potentially heading for a Top 40 slot when the Official Albums Chart is published on Sunday night. Also in the Top 100 are Kate's 2011 collection, Director's Cut (58), The Red Shoes (60) Never For Ever (61), Lionheart (64) and Aerial (77). Kate's chart domination continues on the Official Singles Chart where three of her singles have re-entered midweek - Running Up That Hill (62), Wuthering Heights (77) and This Woman's Work (82). However, there was nothing from her early albums - not even Wuthering Heights - although her fans didn't seem to mind. Kyla Fox, 41, who had travelled from Newcastle, said: 'We've just heard musical history. I dreamt of this but never thought I'd see it. This was on my bucket list.' Michael Anmuth, 46, had come all the way from San Francisco, said: 'It was worth travelling this far because I've waited forever to see her. It has cost me a lot but it's definitely worth it.' Bush soared to fame in 1979 with her single Wuthering Heights, which she wrote when she was just 18. The song based on Emily Brontë's dark love story of the same name was followed by hits including Babooshka and Running Up That Hill. Shy of publicity, she became respected for her uncompromising individualism and refusal to make pop music in anything other than her own style. She was just 20 when she completed The Tour Of Life with three dates at what was then called the Hammersmith Odeon, after topping the charts with Wuthering Heights the previous year, becoming the first woman to go to number one singing one of her own songs. Over the years, theories about her absence from the stage have included her perfectionism, a fear of flying and the death of one of the tour crew, lighting director Bill Duffield, during a show. But in a rare interview with Mojo magazine in 2011 to mark a comeback from one of her lengthy recording silences, she explained that her years of absence from the touring circuit were simply down to the sheer exertion of a show. She said: 'It was enormously enjoyable. But physically it was absolutely exhausting.' MailOnline has contacted representatives of Kate Bush for comment.","Singer had asked fans not to film or take photographs of tour performances .

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . The makers of Grand Theft Auto have accused Lindsay Lohan of suing them purely to get attention after the actress filed a lawsuit claiming a character in the game was based on her. In Manhattan court papers made public yesterday, Take-Two Interactive Software and subsidiary company, Rockstar Games, call the case frivolous and claim it was 'filed for publicity purposes'. The producers of the hugely-popular game are now demanding the lawsuit be dropped and are asking that the actress be made to pay their legal fees up to now. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Lindsay Lohan is suing the makers of Grand Theft Auto V for using her likeness in the game . The 28-year-old Mean Girls star sued the company in July claiming that the game used her voice, image and style in their creation of a bikini-clad character named Lacey Jonas. The company denies this and says the character's only resemblance with Lohan is that they are both young, blonde women. But Lohan insists the similarities go much further. In the game, the actress's lookalike alter-ego parties at infamous celebrity haunt, the Hotel Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, 'a place where the plaintiff once lived and often frequents', according to the case documents. Lohan's legal papers also claim the 'game features a mission where the plaintiff's look-alike asks another character to take her home and escape the paparazzi'. Popular: Fans queue up to buy latest Grand Theft Auto game with giant picture of character Lacey Jonas featured on a promotional board . The papers conclude that the Lacey Jonas character sports the same 'likeness, clothing, outfits, clothing line products, ensemble in the form of hats, hair style, sunglasses and jean shorts worn by [Lohan]...before the release of the GTA V video game'. Lohan's lawyers are yet to comment. In her papers Lohan specifically refers to the The Hotel Chateau Marmont - where a scene in GTA V plays out. A letter written to Lohan from the high-end hotel, located on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, recently surfaced which shows that the star owed them a staggering $46,350 in July 2012.

"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . A chilling photo that allegedly proves Russia's most wanted terrorist is dead was released today by the head of the Chechen Republic. Pro-Vladimir Putin leader Ramzan Kadyrov uploaded the image of what is claimed to be Doku Umarov's body to the social-networking site Instagram. Alongside the photo, he wrote: 'For those who would like to believe that this rat is still alive, we can show him after his death.' WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Proof? This photo that allegedly proves Russia's most wanted terrorist, Doku Umarov, is dead was released today by head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov. It was posted on social-networking site Instagram . Wanted man: Known as Russia's Osama bin Laden, Umarov (pictured) is Vladamir Putin's most wanted enemy . Known as Russia's Osama bin Laden, Umarov is Putin's most wanted enemy - sought for crimes of terrorism, kidnapping, homicide and treason. The bearded warlord is responsible for a string of deadly attacks on Russia, including a train bombing between Moscow and Saint Petersburg which left 26 dead in 2009 and an attack on a Siberian dam which killed 75. He has also been linked to the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings, in which 40 . died, and the hit on one of the city's main airports, Domodedovo, in . 2011, in which 36 people perished. In April, Russian sources indicated Umarov had died without giving clear evidence. Mr Kadyrov (left) wrote alongside the chilling picture: 'For those who would like to believe that this rat is still alive, we can show him after his death'. Right, Umarov has been linked to a string of deadly attacks on Russia . It is not clear why Mr Kadyrov decided to release the photo of his 'dead body' today - particularly as Russia is under the spotlight for allegedly supporting terrorists in Ukraine in downing the Malaysian Boeing 777. The Chechen strongman did not provide any details as to how, where or when Umarov died. But he said: 'I have said earlier that Doku Umarov had been killed in a special mission. But various law enforcement authorities and the media hurried to doubt the information. 'They claimed they did not see the dead body. We at that time had undisputable proofs he had been killed. Later on, the fact of his death was confirmed officially. Atrocity: Umarov's Caucasus Emirate group claimed responsibility for the bomb that caused the November 2009 Nevsky Express train derailment that left 27 dead . Bombings: The group is also thought to have been behind three suicide bombings in the southern Russian city of Volgograd which killed 41 people in 2013, including this attack on a trolleybus . 'Now, to those who would prefer to believe that rat is still alive, we can demonstrate it after death.' On April 8, FSB spy chief Aleksandr Bortnikov told a meeting of the National Anti-Terrorist Committee in Moscow that Umarov's activities had been 'stopped'. Umarov had been seen as a threat to the Sochi Winter Olympics - but he is likely to have been killed earlier than this. Styling himself the 'Emir of the Caucasus Emirate', his aim was to expel non-Muslims from Chechnya, impose Sharia law and wage jihad far beyond the republic's present borders. Attack: Umarov was blamed for suicide bombings in Volgograd (above) which killed 34 people at Christmas . A trademark of his attacks was his deployment of 'black widow' women suicide bombers, ready to cause mass murder in vengeance for the death of their insurgent spouses. The U.S. had placed a $5million (£2.9million) bounty on his head. Umarov, who is thought to have died aged 49, has been reported slain on at least six occasions. In December last year, Kadyrov alleged he has been 'dead a long time'.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .
