The Co-op Bank was last night battling to reassure millions of customers it does not need a bailout from taxpayers – after its credit rating was downgraded to ‘junk’ status. Ratings agency Moody’s warned that the bank might need ‘external support’ amid spiralling losses on bad loans. It assigned the lender the same ‘junk’ credit rating that bailed-out nations Greece and Portugal received in 2010. This marks a humiliating blow for the Co-op, which was last year awarded the accolade of Europe’s ‘most sustainable bank’ by the Financial Times for the third year running. The Moody's credit ratings agency raised doubts about the Co-Operative banks ability to raise funds to plug gaps in its balance sheet . The lender used Twitter to reassure its customers that it does not need a taxpayer bailout . Yesterday the boss of its banking arm, Barry Tootell, stepped down with immediate effect. The downgrade comes just weeks after the Co-op pulled out of a £750million deal to buy 632 branches from Lloyds, blaming the ‘worsened outlook for economic growth’. Consumer experts said under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme customers’ deposits in Co-op licensed accounts are protected up to a total of £85,000. Co-op Bank, whose licence also covers Britannia and the Smile online bank, said there had been ‘no increase in transactions’ from customers at its branches. It said it was ‘disappointed’ by the downgrade, adding: ‘We have a strong funding profile and high levels of liquidity, which are significantly above the regulatory requirements.’ In a Tweet it also dismissed concerns that it could become the latest lender to require a bail-out. ‘We would like to reassure customers and members that we haven’t sought nor do we need government support.’ Barry Tootell today resigned as chief executive of the Co-operative Banking Group . But the Co-op acknowledged that it has not set aside enough spare capital to cushion itself against future shocks. The main threat is spiralling losses from reckless commercial property loans made by Britannia, the former building society that Co-op Bank took over in 2009. The bank slumped to a £674million loss last year as losses from bad loans – mainly commercial property loans made by Britannia – soared to £351 million. The Co-op is reported to need around £750million to plug the black hole in its finances. Moody’s claimed the ‘bank faces the risk of further substantial losses in its non-core portfolio’. It also raised the prospect of another taxpayer bail-out, adding that it may require ‘external support to maintain regulatory capital levels’. Like other lenders, the Co-op is still in the dark about exactly how much it has to raise. The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee revealed last month that UK lenders have a total shortfall of £25billion. The Prudential Regulation Authority, the new banking watchdog, will tell individual lenders what their shortfall is in the coming weeks. Dan Plant from personal finance website MoneySavingExpert.com said: ‘For savers worried about safety, there’s one clear message – if you’ve got under £85,000  combined in accounts with  Co-op, Britannia and Smile, you’re fully protected by the  compensation scheme. ‘Anyone with big savings who uses these brands should check now they’re under the limit.’ Insiders at the Co-op stressed its problems are very different to those which caused the collapse of Northern Rock in 2007.  The North East lender’s downfall was sealed when nervous banks stopped lending to each other, starving it of vital funds. But the Co-op Bank could resort to tapping up parent company Co-operative Group, which owns a string of businesses. It has assets of £82billion, including almost £7billion which could be used to prop up the bank. Last night the Government and Lloyds came under fire for accepting the Co-op’s cut-price £750million offer to run 632 Lloyds branches. State-backed Lloyds was ordered to sell these branches by the European Commission as a condition of receiving a £20billion bailout from UK taxpayers in 2008. But the deal, which would have involved the transfer of 4.8million Lloyds customers to the Co-op, collapsed last month. The Co-op blamed the ‘worsened outlook for economic growth’ and ‘increasing regulatory requirements’.","Barry Toottell quits as chief executive after Moody's downgrade .

A man suspended from a Detroit-area university after writing about his attraction to several of his teachers has lost a $2.2 million lawsuit he had brought against the school, claiming his free-speech rights were violated. Joseph Corlett, 57, a home builder who enrolled in college because of the weak economy, said he was an A-student in a writing class at Oakland University in Rochester until he submitted a journal in 2011 titled 'Hot For Teacher,' the name of a song by the rock band Van Halen. Corlett compared his writing instructor Pamela Mitzelfeld to Ginger, a sultry movie starlet character on the 1960s TV show 'Gilligan's Island.' Joseph Corlett, 57, has had a $2.2 million free-speech lawsuit he had brought against Oakland University thrown out of court . He described her as 'tall, blonde, stacked,' among other things. He also wrote that he feared being distracted and said, 'I'll never learn a thing.' He also described another teacher, who was pregnant, that she was 'hot, and not just from baking the bun in her oven.' Federal Judge Patrick Duggan dismissed Corlett's lawsuit and said that while his words may be appropriate in a karaoke bar, they don't need to be tolerated by Oakland University. He says there was no violation of Joseph Corlett's free speech rights. Corlett compared his writing instructor Pamela Mitzelfeld, right, to Ginger, a sultry movie starlet character on the 1960s TV show 'Gilligan's Island', left . Teacher Mitzelfeld had drawn an Oakland dean's attention to Corlett's prose after reading his journal for the first time. Officials said Corlett's writings violated a policy against intimidation or harassment and last year barred him for three terms, through to the winter of 2013. The university also said he must undergo counseling if he wants to return as a student. In an interview before the judge's decision, Corlett, who now lives in Sarasota, Florida, said he was fighting for his civil rights. ‘When you get past the titillation, you've got to look into what's really going on here,’ he said. ‘It's academic freedom or no academic freedom. We're all collectively dumbed when speech is suppressed or challenged.’ Corlett said students in the English 380 . class were told to write ‘raw things, a personal diary that maybe we . wouldn't want anyone to read.’ He said the teacher had no objection to . his earlier work, which earned an A, an essay about accidentally seeing . women's breasts. Corlett had titled his essay 'Hot for Teacher' after the 1980s Van Halen song . ‘There is no constitutional protection against being offended,’ Corlett said. ‘And while I am sympathetic to anyone's feelings, I repeatedly asked for instruction. I was repeatedly told there were no topics that were out of bounds.’ Corlett was removed from the writing class by two police officers after an Oakland administrator forgot to tell him that he was barred from attending while his status as a student was under review. He had been seeking $2.2 million for mental anguish and the embarrassment of being kicked out of school. Corlett enrolled full-time at Oakland in 2011 after earning an associate degree from Oakland Community College. The journal in which he wrote the piece was labelled as a ‘place for a writer to try out ideas and record impressions and observations’. The idea was that uncensored writings and . thoughts in the journal, which he handed in November, could be used to . create proper essays. Officials at Oakland said Corlett's writings violated a policy against intimidation or harassment and barred him for three terms . He compared one teacher in another entry to Ginger Grant, a character played by actress Tina Louise in 1960s TV comedy series Gilligan's Island. His wife Lynn has supported him during his lawsuit and his lawyers had claimed that he was been treated like a ‘student with a mental disability’. Ms Mitzelfeld told university officials that she would leave if they did not ban Mr Corlett from campus, reported the Huffington Post. She also claimed she was concerned he might be carrying a gun in her classrooms after he allegedly wrote about his support for carrying concealed weapons in previous work. Oakland University Writing Center director Sherry Wynn Perdue told the Huffington Post that Mr Corlett had ‘victimised’ Ms Mitzelfeld. Hot for Teacher by Van Halen was a sexually suggestive song from the U.S. band's album 1984, which courted controversy with its bizarre video.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:10 EST, 23 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:46 EST, 23 July 2013 . A jury has handed down a verdict awarding $1.2 billion in damages against a Florida nursing home accused of negligence. The Polk County jury took just over an hour to reach its verdict on Monday, in a case brought by the family of Arlene Townsend, who died after repeatedly falling while staying at Auburndale Oaks Healthcare Center. The substantial sum, which includes more than $1 billion in punitive damages and $110 million in compensation for Mrs Townsend's son, Gary, was awarded after the six-person jury was asked to determine damages, not liability, The Ledger said. Treasured: A lawyer for Gary Townsend, pictured with Arlene, says the damages reflect how much he valued his mother . 'He is grateful that the jury saw the value of his mother's life,' Bennie Lazzara Jr, who represented Mr Townsend, said. 'To him, she was a treasure. The jury valued her the same way.' The lawsuit was first filed in 2009, and focused on the care Mrs Townsend received at the home, where she lived from 2004 until her death at the age of 69, in 2007. Trans Healthcare Inc. and Trans Healthcare Management were listed as defendants in the lawsuit, My Fox Tampa Bay reported. It was claimed that Mrs Townsend fell repeatedly while at the nursing home and had not been supervised properly, according to The Ledger. Mrs Townsend fell 17 times while living at the nursing home, resulting in a hip fracture on the last occasion. According to the lawsuit, she was left in bed for days before being taken to hospital. The nursing home was said to be short-staffed, and federal and state money that should have been used for care was being diverted elsewhere, WFLA8 reported. Mrs Townsend's case was allegedly the fourth brought against the company. Issac Ruiz-Caruz, who represented Mr Townsend, claimed that the case had been about 'corporate fraud, corporate greed'. 'It was an enterprise of a . conglomerate that took over a nursing home in Polk County and looted the . assets of the company, short-staffed it, under budgeted it and, as a . result, the nursing home residents were suffering,' he told WFLA8. 'Ms Townsend was one of those nursing home residents that suffered and ultimately died as a result of those acts,' Mr Ruiz-Caruz added. Care home: Arlene Townsend fell 17 times and fractured her hip while staying at Auburndale Oaks . The companies argued that they only ran the nursing home until September 2004, according to court documents seen by the Ledger. Mr Lazzara said the large award was a sign from the jury that mistreatment of nursing home residents would not be tolerated. He added: 'It's one step in the fight, but it's a significant one.' The lawyers for the family must now try to claim the damages. The nursing home and an attorney representing the company have not commented on the case.","Arlene Townsend was not supervised properly, case claimed .

A university professor who stabbed his wife to death wrote 'Kill Kathie Kill Kathie Kill Kathie!!!!!' on a to-do list before murdering her, it has emerged. Jean-Pierre Trias wrote the grisly message on a list of daily chores that was saved in a computer file recovered by police, according to a wrongful death suit filed by the sisters of victim Katherine Porter. The suit, which was filed in Washtenaw County Trial Court, says that the note shows premeditation in Porter's murder. She was found dead at their home with two knives still in her body on January 11.

A new species of shrew that American scientists say has the 'most bizarre mammalian spine on Earth' has been found in equatorial Africa. The miniature Hero Shrew was discovered by scientists at Chicago's Field Museum who examined its spine, which has been an enigma to evolutionary biologists. The interlocking vertebrae of the Hero . Shrew render its spine four to five times more robust relative to body . mass - a condition not found in any other mammal. A new species of Hero Shrew that American scientists said has the 'most bizarre mammalian spine on Earth' has been found in equatorial Africa by scientists at Chicago's Field Museum . The new species of the Hero Shrew is named Scutisorex thori and possesses features that might represent intermediate character states . between the only other known Hero Shrew species (Scutisorex somereni), . and common shrews. The Hero Shrew was first discovered in 1910 but its most notable feature was not revealed . for another seven years, when a specimen was dissected to reveal the . most peculiar backbone of any mammal. It's spine is unique as the lower vertebrae have multiple lateral processes that interlock with the processes of neighboring vertebra. The arrangement, along with surrounding musculature, affords the animal extraordinary strength, so much so that the Hero Shrew has traditionally been worn as a talisman. Bill Stanley, Director of Collections and zoologist at the Field Museum, said: 'This shrew first came to light when explorers came to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo.' 'The explorers watched in amazement as a full-grown man stood on the back of the Hero Shrew, and the animal walked away, unharmed.' The spine of the first species of Hero shrew to be discovered (labelled B) is much stronger than the common shrew's backbone, labelled A . The newly discovered Hero Shrew's spine (pictured) is unique as the lower vertebrae have multiple lateral processes that interlock with the processes of neighboring vertebra. The arrangement, along with surrounding musculature, affords the animal extraordinary strength . Until now, there have been no other species of this bizarre shrew. The . new species described in this study represents a possible intermediate . between the original Hero Shrew and other shrews, since is possesses an . interlocking spine, but with fewer lower vertebrae and lateral processes . than the first Hero Shrew species. Humans have five lumbar vertebrae as do most other mammals, but the Hero shrew has at least 10. Mr Stanley said: 'Scutisorex thori has eight vertebrae, and fewer lateral processes than the original species.' The specimen of the new Hero Shrew was collected in the lowland forest near the Tshuapa River in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In their study published in Biology Letters, the scientists suggest these shrews position themselves between the trunk and leaf bases of Palms and use their unique spine to exert force and gain access to concentrated sources of beetle larvae that are otherwise protected from predation. The same adaptation may allow these animals to lift logs or rocks to access invertebrates – a food resource that remains unavailable to many other mammals. Here are backbones of three types of shew: The standard shrew (A) the original Hero Shrew (B) andthe newly discovered Hero Shrew (C). Scientists believe the new Hero Shrew might lift rocks and logs to find grubs . The specimen of Scutisorex thori now residing at The Field Museum is a holotype, meaning that it will be the standard for identifying other members of the species. The new species is named in honor of Thorvald 'Thor' Holmes, Jr. of the Humboldt State University Vertebrate Museum, at the suggestion of Bill Stanley, who did his graduate work there. The suggested common name is 'Thor's Hero Shrew', appropriately invoking Thor, the god of strength in Norse mythology. Mr Stanley said: 'The Age of Discovery is not over - in fact, discoveries such as these happen in natural history collections, like the ones that we have at The Field Museum. 'In addition, hypotheses such as the one that we've generated concerning the functional significance of the Hero Shrew's spine fuel the scientific machine.

New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick has broken his silence over former tight end Aaron Hernandez's murder charge, saying he was 'personally disappointed and hurt' to learn of the investigation.

And in yet another twist on Wednesday, a report claimed Hernandez has also become the focus of a double . homicide investigation involving two men who were shot dead in Boston . last year.

Held without bond: Anthony Joseph Garcia has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder in Nebraska . A doctor accused of killing four people in revenge for being fired 12 years ago from a university residency program was today ordered to be held in prison without bond. Dr Anthony J. Garcia, 40, dressed in a yellow jumpsuit and heavily shackled, made his first appearance in Douglas County Court in Omaha, Nebraska on Tuesday morning. Garcia has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder in connection with the deaths of Dr Roger Brumback and his wife Mary at their Omaha home in May this year. He is also believed to be responsible for the murders of 11-year-old Thomas Hunter and his family's housekeeper Shirlee Sherman back in 2008 in Omaha. Police say the killings were acts of revenge against Brumback and another Creighton University doctor who fired him from a pathology residency in 2001 for unprofessional conduct. Garcia was arrested last week in southern Illinois and extradited late on Thursday to Omaha. An affidavit unsealed last week showed receipts, eyewitness accounts, cell phone records and evidence at the Brumbacks' home connected Garcia to Omaha at the times of the killings. Garcia's attorneys argued before Judge Lawrence Barrett on Tuesday that the evidence in the affidavit was 'circumstantial and thinly veiled'. Garcia will be held in the Douglas County Department of Corrections pending a preliminary hearing set for August 14. The Brumbacks, both 65, were found dead . on May 14. Each had stab wounds to the side of their necks and Dr . Brumback also was shot, according to the affidavit. Police said the stab . wounds were similar to ones found in the 2008 murders. Attack: Investigators believe that in May, Garcia broke into Dr Roger Brumback's Omaha home, fatally shot him and stabbed his wife Mary to death (couple are pictured) Garcia is also accused of stabbing to death Thomas Hunter (left) and Shirlee Sherman (right) in 2008. Hunter is the 11-year-old son of Creighton professor William Hunter and Sherman was the Hunter family's housekeeper . Garcia was fired in 2001 by Dr Brumback and Dr William Hunter. The murdered 11-year-old was Hunter's son, but police have said they do not believe that the boy or the housekeeper were the intended targets. According to the affidavit and records, Garcia had applied for an Indiana medical license in 2008 and in 2012. Indiana denied his requests. Records released by the Indiana medical board from those applications show he failed to complete residencies in New York, Illinois and Louisiana in addition to Nebraska. He was suspended from a New York residency for yelling at a radiology technician, then withdrew from the program in 1999. He also withdrew from an Illinois residency, citing migraine headaches. Garcia's application for a Louisiana medical license was rejected in February 2008, two weeks before Hunter and Sherman were killed, in part because he had not completed the other residency programs. This undated photo provided by the Creighton Medical School shows Dr. Roger Brumback, who was murdered along with his wife Mary in May 2013 .","Dr Anthony Garcia, 40, held without bond in Omaha, Nebraska .

The company is said to be preparing to increase production of the headmounted devices by the end of the year . Liquid crystal on silicon ( LCOS) is a technology used in projection televisions and other devices that beam images to a screen. The images are reflected by the liquid crystals, which act in a similar way to mirrors. The crystals are applied directly to the surface of a silicon chip coated  which is highly reflective layer. A benefit of LCOS technologies is that the crystals can produce high-resolution and contrast images compared to those used in plasma screens. Google uses these chips in the screen on the right lens of its headmounted Google Glass products. Figures quoted by the Wall Street . Journal suggest the company could be looking to ship up to two million . units a year, while Mark Gomes of PoisedtoTriple Research suggested that . the Taiwan-based manufacturer wants to boost production to seven million a . year.

Tourism managers for Las Vegas are the latest to jump aboard the bandwagon of brands using the royal birth as a means of generating some cheap publicity for whatever they’re selling. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) expressed its congratulations to Prince George, born on Monday to Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, by posting a greeting on Facebook that read, ‘Congratulations on the royal addition. See you in 21 years.’ The wording is of course a cheeky reference to the new born baby’s Las Vegas-loving Uncle Harry who caused quite a stir when he visited Sin City last July. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority has expressed its congratulations on the royal birth with a cheeky online marketing campaign . Too young for Vegas: The Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William pose with their new baby son Prince George on Tuesday . The LVCVA estimates that the publicity generated by Prince Harry's infamous trip - which included a scandalous game of strip billiards - was worth the equivalent of $23 million-worth of free advertising. Little wonder then that the same organization has issued the tongue-in-cheek online ad in an attempt to get some mileage out of the latest addition to the British royal family. A host of companies haven’t been shy about trying to make a buck from the new Royal birth. Within hours of the announcement that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had welcomed their baby boy into the world on Monday, a raft of companies took to Twitter advertising their brands along with cute messages of congratulation. Profitable: Prince Harry, pictured partying in a Las Vegas pool, caused a media storm last summer when pictures were published of him naked in a hotel room . The LVCVA exploited Prince Harry's infamous visit last July which they estimate generated the equivalent of $23 million-worth of free advertising for the city . Among the billion dollar firms hijacking the birth of the third in line to the British throne were Coca Cola, Starbucks, Play-Doh, Oreo and Charmin. It would have been hard to miss the sensationalized media storm that erupted last summer when pictures of a naked Prince Harry in Vegas - with a young lady no less - were leaked to the world's press. The slightly grainy snap shots were taken on a camera phone during a private party in the five-star Encore Wynn resort and while they didn't do much to enhance Harry's public image, they did wonders for the Las Vegas tourism industry. The LVCVA estimated that the royal scandal generated an extra $23 million for the city in increased tourism in the months immediately following the incident. The organization estimates that 154 million people worldwide saw the infamous pics in the two months following Harry's visit. LVCVA . Board Chairman Tom Collins apparently was heard to say at a . board meeting not long after the visit: ‘God bless Prince Harry. He made us a bunch of money.’ The organization welcomed almost 40 million visitors last year including more than 330,000 people from the United Kingdom.

Redick had a bizarre 'abortion' contract drawn up with his former girlfriend in which he agreed to keep dating her for a year, or pay her $25,000, if she terminated her pregnancy, it has been reported. The written agreement was allegedly drawn up by the pair's lawyers in 2007, when Redick was still a rookie, and signed by the basketball player and his recent ex-girlfriend, model Vanessa Lopez, who was claiming to be pregnant with his child. The startling contract, which is reportedly signed by the guard, stated: 'Redick has agreed that once Lopez has terminated said pregnancy and has provided medical proof... Redick and Lopez shall attempt to establish and maintain a social and/or dating relationship for a period of one year.' Contract: The written 2007 agreement was signed by Redick, left, and his recent ex-girlfriend, model Vanessa Lopez, right, who was claiming to be pregnant with his child . MediaTakeOut unearthed the fascinating document today. Redick declined to comment to MailOnline on the contract. The basketball star played for Orlando Magic for six and a half seasons before he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks and then, about a month ago, to the Los Angeles Clippers. In the six-year-old contract it states that if it turned out Lopez had never been pregnant or if she failed to follow through on the abortion, Redick would have no further obligations to keep up the dating charade. If he simply got bored and didn't want to keep dating her following the abortion, he would be contractually required to give her 'written notice' 30 days prior to any break up and pay up the $25,000. First to publish: MediaTakeOut published the contract online on Tuesday . Star: J.J. Redick, pictured left, played six and a half seasons for Orlando Magic . But if Lopez continued to hang around after the year was up, it would be considered 'stalking,' the extremely unromantic contract stipulates. Redick's lawyer also insisted in the abortion agreement that the document itself may not be used to prove his putative paternity 'which paternity he has denied and does continue to deny.' Lopez went on to have liaisons and subsequently take to court other NBA greats.

An out-of-control natural gas well 55 miles off the Louisiana continued to burn Wednesday, hours after a blowout that prompted the evacuation of 44 workers. Officials stressed that Tuesday's blowout wouldn't be close to as damaging as the 2010 BP oil spill, in which an oil rig, the Deepwater Horizon, exploded off the Louisiana coast killing 11 workers and spewing millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. No injuries were reported as a result of Tuesday night's fire, Eileen Angelico, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. Scroll down for video . Fire: The Hercules 265 gas well caught fire 55 miles off the Louisiana coast late Tuesday, just hours after an explosion sent 44 unharmed workers fleeing for safety. The blaze continued, unabated, into Wednesday . She said it wasn't known what caused the gas to ignite. It also wasn't clear early Wednesday how and when crews would attempt to extinguish the blaze. BSEE said earlier Tuesday that a firefighting vessel with water and foam capabilities had been dispatched to the scene. Wild Well Control Inc. was hired to try to bring the well under control. Angelico said Wild Well personnel approached the well earlier Tuesday night, before the fire, but they determined it was unsafe to get closer when they were about 200 feet away from it. Continues: The well is located 55 miles off the coast of Louisiana. Though it continued to burn Wednesday, the accident is nowhere near as disastrous as the Deepwater Horizon spill, around 100 miles to the east . The gas blowout was reported Tuesday morning. The Coast Guard kept nautical traffic out of an area within 500 meters of the site throughout the day. The Federal Aviation Administration restricted aircraft up to 2,000 feet above the area. BSEE said inspectors flying over the site soon after the blowout saw a light sheen covering an area about a half-mile by 50 feet. However, it was dissipating quickly. Earlier this month, a gas well off the Louisiana coast flowed for several days before being sealed. Chris Roberts, a member of the Jefferson Parish Council in south Louisiana, said the travel restrictions might pose an inconvenience for participants in an upcoming deep sea fishing tournament. Worse spill: To the east of Hercules 265, the ill-fated Deepwater Horizon spill became the worst in U.S. history when it caught fire in 2010 and leaked 205 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico . ‘It could change some plans as to where some people plan to fish,’ he said. Tuesday's blowout occurred near an unmanned offshore gas platform that was not currently producing natural gas, said Angelico. The workers were aboard a portable drilling rig known as a jackup rig, owned by Hercules Offshore Inc., which was a contractor for exploration and production company Walter Oil & Gas Corp. Walter Oil & Gas reported to the BSEE that the rig was completing a ‘sidetrack well’ - a means of re-entering the original well bore, Angelico said. The purpose of the sidetrack well in this instance was not immediately clear. A spokesman for the corporation did not have the information Tuesday night. Industry websites say sidetrack wells are sometimes drilled to remedy a problem with the existing well bore. ‘It's a way to overcome an engineering problem with the original well,’ Ken Medlock, an energy expert at Rice University's Baker Institute said. ‘They're not drilled all the time, but it's not new.’","No oil spills reported from Hercules 265 drilling rig after an explosion early Tuesday .

Under a cost-saving plan by the U.S. Postal Service, people moving into newly-built homes will not have mail delivered to their doors and will instead have to pick it up at the curb or neighborhood cluster boxes. The Postal Service began the change in April, and Congress is considering an even bolder shift that would also affect existing houses. It's unclear if delivery to the door will eventually be eliminated entirely. 'Converting delivery away from door delivery to either curb line or centralized delivery would enable the Postal Service to provide service to more customers in less time,' Postal Service spokeswoman Sue Brennan said Tuesday. Stand and deliver: With the Postal Service facing billions of dollars in annual losses, door-to-door delivery service could be phased out in favor of cheaper alternatives . More than 30 million American homes get delivery to the door and another 50 million get mail dropped at curbside mailboxes. But the Postal Service, which is buckling under massive financial losses, sees savings in centralized mail delivery. Door-to-door delivery costs the Postal Service about $353 per address each year. Curbside delivery costs $224, and cluster boxes cost $160 per address. With cluster boxes, mailboxes for individual addresses are grouped together at a central neighborhood location. The move is one of many cost-cutting steps the Postal Service is trying as it continues to plead with Congress for permission to overhaul its business and avert a bailout. The agency also proposed eliminating . Saturday mail delivery but was forced to back off that plan this year . after lawmakers and some industries balked. Boxes: Alternatives for door-to-door delivery are shared neighborhood boxes for receiving mail, or curbside delivery . The agency also proposed eliminating Saturday mail delivery but was forced to back off that plan this year after lawmakers and some industries balked. Representative Darrell Issa, a . California Republican who has spearheaded Postal Service reforms, has . introduced a bill that would completely do away with door delivery and . require curbside or cluster boxes for existing residences with an . exemption for people with disabilities. The legislation was to be considered on Wednesday by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. A . senior committee staffer said the legislation could realize annual . savings of $4 billion from switching to curbside and $6 billion from . cluster boxes. Last . year, the Postal Service lost $16 billion, mostly due to dwindling mail . volumes and payments into a mandatory fund for its future retirees' healthcare. The . agency, which does not receive taxpayer funds, is under pressure to . modify its business model and raise revenues or risk requiring a bailout . of nearly $50 billion by 2017. The Postal Service's efforts to require cluster boxes for new residences are being received with trepidation. Cranberry Township, 25 miles north of Pittsburgh, recently received a letter from the local postmaster saying that all new homes would be serviced by cluster box units rather than door-to-door or curbside delivery. Beleaguered: Last year the USPS lost $16 billion, mostly due to dwindling mail . Most new residential construction plans have already been approved and the change would require going back to the drawing board, said Ron Henshaw, the town's director for community development. 'Our board supervisors who actually run the township are very concerned about this,' he said. Since April, residential developers can no longer choose between curbside or cluster box delivery, agency spokeswoman Brennan said. The Postal Service makes that determination based on what it considers to be more effective. The Postal Service has also been asking shopping malls and business parks to voluntarily convert to centralized delivery.","In a new cost-saving plan by the USPS, newly built homes will not be eligible for to-the-door delivery .

But it is clear to anyone who saw Carole Middleton and the Duchess of Cornwall arrive at the Lindo Wing at St Mary's this afternoon that Carole and Camilla are no ordinary grannies. They are the ultra groomed, ultra glamorous grannies of the future King. The two arrived separately to visit the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their newborn son, Carole arriving at 3pm with her husband Michael, and Camilla at around 5.30pm with Charles. And both looked the picture of elegance. Glamorous grannies: Carole arriving at the Lindo Wing this afternoon.

Fittingly, Carole chose a . pale blue printed dress by Irish designer Orla Kiely - a label worn . frequently by both of her daughters - to meet the grandson she will have . such a hand in raising. The dress, which was belted neatly at Carole's slender waist, was from the 2012 collection and would have cost around £160. For . her part, the ever more glamorous Camilla, who was once lambasted for . her dowdy style but is now so often the picture of elegance, wore a . pretty white silk dress with frilled neckline. While the third in line to the throne is the first grandchild for Carole, for Camilla it is her sixth. The two sets of grandparents arrived this afternoon just moments before the Duke and Duchess were to leave the hospital for their journey back to Kensington Palace. The new parents are set to spend two weeks at the Palace while William enjoys his two weeks of paternity leave. Then, it is thought that Kate will travel to Bucklebury to the mansion Carole and Michael bought earlier this year where she will spend the next four weeks under the wing of the Middleton before the couple are likely to join the Queen in Balmoral where she will be for the summer.

And while Carole paired the dress with . nude mid-heel courts from Russell & Bromley Chic Pump mid-heel court, £175, Camilla wore a pair of cream and taupe courts. In an indication of the key role the Middletons will play in the upbringing of the heir to the throne, they today became the very first members of the family to meet the Duke and Duchess's new . son, almost 23 hours after the infant was born. Until then the new parents had spent time bonding together with their baby. Carole declared her grandson, her first grandchild, to be 'beautiful' after the hour and a quarter-long visit. They are both doing really well,' she said. 'We are so thrilled.’ Carole added that the new parents were doing ‘fabulously’ - but wouldn't be drawn over the issue of naming the baby. No suggestions from them then? ‘Absolutely not!’ said Carole. Carole and Michael arrived a short while after Kate's hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker, unofficially confirmed that the Duke and Duchess would be departing today by arriving at the back entrance of the Lindo Wing wheeling along her kit bag.

The National Security Agency may have the technology to collect and sift through massive amounts of electronic data produced throughout the world, but claims it isn’t capable of searching emails sent by its own employees. In response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the spying agency has claimed that it simply doesn’t have the correct technology to carry out such a search. 'There's no central method to search an email at this time with the way our records are set up, unfortunately,' NSA Freedom of Information Act officer Cindy Blacker told ProPublica. The NSA, barely out of the news thanks to whistle-blower Edward Snowdon, claims that it doesn't have the technology capable of searching emails sent by its own employees . ‘The system is 'a little antiquated and archaic,' she added. A journalist for the website received the unexpected response when they approached the organization requesting to see correspondence between NSA employees and the National Geographic Channel regarding a documentary which had aired on the TV channel. A few days after filing his initial request, Blacker called and was asked to narrow his request since the FOIA office can only search emails 'person by person,' rather than in bulk. Blacker said he was bemused by the organizations response because it is quite common for large corporations to do bulk searches of their employees email as part of internal investigations. A new National Security Agency data center in Bluffdale, Utah is set to open in the fall and will be the largest of several interconnected centers spread throughout the country . The NSA has more than 30,000 employees. 'It's just baffling,' Mark Caramanica of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press told ProPublica. 'This is an agency that's charged with monitoring millions of communications globally and they can't even track their own internal communications in response to a FOIA request.' On Tuesday it was revealed that intelligence sources now believe whistle-blower Edward Snowden was unable to access the 'crown jewels' NSA programs that secretly monitor telephone and online conversations worldwide. After launching a wide reaching internal review demanded by President Obama, the NSA found that Snowden failed to see any ECI, or 'extremely compartmentalized information' according to one official familiar with the review. The administration has said that it knows the material Snowden downloaded but sources told CNN that this does reduce the seriousness of the former freelance contractors actions. Making a break for it: Edward Snowden's lawyer announced that it is in the leaker's best interest to stay in Russia for the time being before heading to a South American country for long-term asylum . 'We are not downplaying it,' said one source to CNN about the amount of data stolen by Snowden. The official spoke to CNN on background because the assessment is not fully completed. On Monday Snowden revealed that he . expects to be granted papers this week that will allow him to leave . the Moscow airport and legally exit into the Russian city. The . former consultant turned national security leaker has spent a month in . the transit area of a Moscow airport and his Russian lawyer announced on . Monday that they hope it will come to an end very soon. Anatoly . Kucherena, who helped the American file his bid for temporary asylum in . Russia on July 16, said Snowden thinks it is in his best interest to . stay in Russia for the time being before heading to a South American . country for long-term asylum. Snowden reportedly believes it would be unsafe to try to travel to Latin America soon because of U.S. efforts to return him to the United States to face espionage charges. Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena speaks to the media after visiting NSA leaker Edward Snowden at Sheremetyevo airport outside Moscow on Wednesday . 'He should get this certificate (allowing him to leave the airport) shortly,' Mr Kucherena said. Snowden's bid for temporary asylum in . Russia may take up to three months to process, but he can pass through . customs based on the initial response to his request, Kucherena added. Snowden has not ruled out seeking Russian citizenship, Kucherena said. Instead he is thought to be focusing his efforts on Latin American countries like Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua who have all said they would grant him political asylum. The problem with those destinations, however, is that none of them are reachable by direct commercial flight from Moscow. Snowden's presence at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport since June 23 has strained U.S.-Russian relations, with President Obama publicly and privately calling on Prime Minister Putin to order his extradition to the United States. Causing problems: The battle over Snowden has increased tensions between President Obama and President Putin, as the U.S. wants him back so the government can prosecute but Russia refuses . The drama between the two world leaders began shortly after it was revealed that Snowden flew from Hong Kong to the Russian capitol, with the white House claiming that there was a 'clear legal basis' to extradite Snowden. Instead, Putin tried to deflect the issue at a press conference during a trip to Finland where he said: 'Snowden is a free person. The sooner he chooses his final destination, the better it is for him and Russia'. President Obama has said he won't engage in any 'wheeling, dealing and trading' to get the leaker back on American soil in order to prosecute him for releasing top secret documents about NSA surveillance programs. 'I'm not going to be scrambling jets to get to a 29-year-old hacker,' President Obama said of the whistle blower during his trip to Dakar, Senegal.","Despite having the technology to spy on people around the world, the NSA claims it can't adequately search emails sent by its own workers .

'Creepy': Those who knew prime suspect Taylor Holder have described a socially awkward teenager with a love of weapons . The prime suspect in the murder of little Alanna Gallagher was 'weird and creepy' with a violent past, according to those who knew him. Classmates of 17-year-old Tyler Holder, who remains in a critical condition after being shot in the head by police, have described how the socially awkward teenager had a love of weapons, carried knives, and would crack sick jokes about rape. Holder opened fire on police yesterday when they arrived to arrest him, hitting officer Charles Lodatto in the groin. Mikayla Dawson, 16, remembered him as an 'angry person' from their days at Wayside Middle School. She said: 'He was the kid that you were always . really nice to because you didn’t know if he was going to come shoot up . the school.' Police have now confirmed neighbours have described Holder to them as a 'troublemaker' and that . he had been involved in 'criminal mischief' in the area. One neighbour even claimed to have seen a gray tarpaulin in Holder's back garden two or three months ago, similar to that covering Alanna, 6, when she was found dead just yards from her home on Babbling Brook Drive. Lauren Allen, 15, recalled a confrontation between her older brother and Holder a few years ago after a rare snowfall, when Holder destroyed a snowman her brother had built. In retaliation,Lauren’s brother threw a snowball at Holder, who 'just turned around and pulled out his pocket knife'. Lauren added: 'He was weird and creepy, and he’s been violent in the past.' Tragic: Six-year-old Alanna Gallagher was found bound and gagged. The youngster had been raped. Right, Charles Lodotto, who he opened fire on hitting the officer in the groin . Boyfriend: Patricia Hustede banned Holder from her home after he started dating her daughter, Cassie . Cassie Hustede dated Holder until earlier this year. The 20-year-old is currently being held in Tarrant County jail on a burglary charge, but her mother, Patricia, said that she had concerns about Holder from the beginning. 'I said to Cassie, ""There’s something bad about him, keep him away from my house"".' She explained Holder would visit the house even after Cassie had gone to jail to see how she was doing. She added: 'He fooled me. It just freaks me out that I allowed him in my house, around my kids and my grandkids.' Weapons: Holder was said to have carried knives and pulled one on a teenage boy after destroying his snowman, according to one source . The probable cause affidavit for Holder’s arrest, obtained by WFAA-TV (Channel 8), offers new details about the suffering inflicted upon Alanna, who went missing on July 1. The little girl, who was known for riding on her purple scooter in search of playmates, had been brutally raped. Her partially clothed body was found by 14-year-old Owen . Whiddon bound and wrapped in a grey tarpaulin in the middle of a street about a mile from her home later in the day of her disappearance. Genetic evidence was matched through DNA tests to a sample that Holder voluntarily provided to police earlier this month, the documents say. Belt: A DNA sample taken by police of Holder matched DNA found on Alanna's body and on a belt found at the scene . His DNA was also found on the buckle of a belt used to wrap Alanna’s body in the tarp. Four Wal-Mart bags were taped over the girl’s head with red duct tape secured around her neck. Her wrists and ankles were bound with the same tape and her body and clothes were wet with an unknown liquid. Police later found what is believed to be the same kind of duct tape in rubbish bags outside the home Holder shared with his mother just two doors from where Alanna lived with her family. Originally, Saginaw Police had said they had no specific suspects, but the affidavit suggests Holder was under suspicion almost immediately. Within hours of Alanna’s body being found officers reported seeing Tyler Holder 'pacing up and down the sidewalk', the affidavit says. Residents informed police Holder had told them that it was Alanna’s body that had been found, even before the authorities had revealed the identity of the victim. The next day, as officers searched the Gallagher home, Holder was seen standing across the street watching. Holder was questioned early in the investigation and told police on the day of Alanna's death he woke up about 2pm, watched television and went to apply for jobs, having recently been made unemployed by Sonic. The affidavit reads: 'Holder stated that he had no contact with Alanna Gallagher and that she had never been in his house,' Holder also denied having a tarpaulin in his back garden. But video surveillance obtained from the north and south ends of Babbling Brook Drive did not show Holder driving his vehicle that day as he had said. When they analysed his mobile phone, they found pictures of him with a garden hose in a sexual position. During an interview, Holder had admitted that he had sex with other men. On July 5, officers took a DNA sample from his mouth and were notified on Saturday it matched evidence found on Alanna's body. At about 9am on Tuesday, officers arrived Holder's home in unmarked cars. Neighbours heard them pounding on the door shortly before multiple shots rang out. Lodatto was shot in the groin, and the bullet hit an artery and broke into pieces. Arlington Police Chief Will Johnson said he was recovering from his injuries, although he had a long road ahead of him. Heartbreaking: The arrest comes after Alanna's body was found tied and partially naked with a bag over her head under this tarp in the street. A 14-year-old boy came across her body . Holder was shot in the head when another officer opened fire. He was taken John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth. Holder's mother Kim was contacted on Tuesday evening. When asked about the condition of her son, she replied 'not so good'. Her lawyer Lance Evans later added: 'Mrs Holder is in shock and is extremely worried about the condition of her son, as any mother would be. 'I ask that the Holder family’s request for privacy be honored as they come to grips with today’s events.' Alanna's family claim they have been targeted in the aftermath of the horrific incident.

A mother of twins has told how shocked she was when her seven-year-old boys managed to rack up a $3,000 iTunes bill, despite doing it through a free iPad app. Paula Marner from St John's, Canada, was on a trip to the UK and had left her sons Elias and Malachy at home with her iPad, so they could play Clash of Clans, an app she had downloaded for free. According to CBC news, after just ten days, the boys inadvertently maxed out her credit card and amassed a whopping $3,000 in charges - simply by typing in her iTunes login password while playing the game. Expensive: Paula Marner from St John's, Canada, gave her sons Elias and Malachy her iPad to play with while she was away. They inadvertently bought $3,000 worth of game features by making in-app purchases . Innocent mistake: The boys (pictured) thought they were doing nothing wrong, since their parents had simply told them never to download an app without permission . At first, Ms Marner assumed that the charges meant there had been 'fraudulent or criminal activity' on her card from the UK. But in fact, it was her seven-year-olds playing the game - which is one of the highest grossing iPad apps of all time - while she was away. The boys apparently typed in Ms Marner's iTunes password, and were then prompted to buy game features like tokens and gems which ranged in price from 99 cents to $99. Beneath the purchase options in the app, a small banner reads: '(Costs real money)'. 'That kept coming up consistently and they kept tapping it, because it's just tap purchase, tap purchase, tap purchase,' said the angered mother. She admits the it was her mistake for . giving her sons the Apple iTunes password, which they had to use each . time they logged in to play the game. Still, the boys thought they were . doing nothing wrong, since their parents had simply told them never . to download an app without permission.

'They kept tapping it, because it's just tap purchase, tap purchase, tap purchase' Like Clash of Clans, the game was free for the boy to download, but acquiring virtual food and coins within the app cost up to £70 each. The family, who also received a refund from Apple, only discovered the costly bill when the boy's grandmother had her credit card declined at a grocery store. Apple is also currently in the process of settling a lawsuit filed by five parents who claim to have had similar experiences with in-app purchases.

Huma Abedin professes her love for her husband in an unfortunately-timed essay in Harper's Bazaar which came out just hours after another woman revealed the sex chats she had with the disgraced former Congressman. The article comes as a vow of support for his bid to become New York City's next mayor, and was released the morning after the notoriously private Abedin spoke out at his press conference Tuesday where he confirmed that he will not be dropping out of the race. 'People have said many things about my . husband—some nice, some not so nice. And that will surely continue. Launching this campaign was not an easy decision for our family to make. Putting yourself out there comes with a cost,' she wrote in Harper's Bazaar. In a column that will appear in the magazine's September edition, the longtime Hillary Clinton aide tells how she went from being a 'single workaholic' to a wife and mother in a matter of three years. Scroll down for video . 'I love him. I have forgiven him. I believe in him': Huma Abedin read a statement at the Tuesday press conference reaffirming her belief in her husband and their marriage . Facing the backlash: Weiner addressed reporters in front of his apartment building on Wednesday morning but he did not have his wife at his side this time . When her husband Anthony Weiner launched his campaign to run for mayor of New York City two years after resigning from Congress amid a Twitter sexting scandal, he said that there were other women who would come forward with allegations against him. Opening up: Huma Abedin wrote an essay in the upcoming issue of Harper's Bazaar about how she decided to forgive her husband and supports his run for mayor . In the essay, she said that in addition . to being the 'smart, caring, and dedicated person' he has always been, . 'he is now something else- a better man'. What Abedin likely didn't know was that one such woman would release screen grabs of her virtual conversations with Weiner and the naked pictures he sent of himself- just days before the Harper's Bazaar issue hit newsstands. 'New Yorkers will have to decide for themselves whether or not to give him a second chance. I had to make that same decision for myself, for my son, for our family. And I know in my heart that I made the right one,' she wrote in a preview of the piece that was posted on the magazine's website. Though Abedin has worked for Hillary Clinton for nearly two decades, starting when she was an intern in the White House and worked for the then-First Lady. In her role as Mrs Clinton's top aide, she has kept to the sidelines, leaving her boss to be the focus of attention. 'I . kept my personal life private, even as the people I was close to lived . in the public eye. But all that changed two years ago, and Anthony and I . have spent these past few years working through the very private . challenges we faced on a very public stage,' she wrote in Harper's . Bazaar. Her husband's bid . for Mayor changed all that. She first appeared in one of his campaign . ads and made her press conference debut on Tuesday when she read a . statement in defense of her husband. Public defense: Abedin broke her notoriously private shell by appearing alongside her husband a year after he resigned in a July 2012 People article. It was revealed he maintained online relationships even at that time . 'When we faced this publicly two years . ago it was the beginning of a time in our marriage that was very . difficult and it took us a very long time to get through it,' Ms Abedin . said at today's press conference. Together: In the Harper's Bazaar article, Abedin talks about how she went from being a 'single workaholic' to a wife and mother in three years, seen here at their 2010 wedding . 'Anthony's . made some horrible mistakes both before he resigned from congress and . after but I do very strongly believe that that is between us. 'I love him. I have forgiven him. I believe in him.' For . his part, Weiner said that his wife was aware that he was still making . contact with women he had never met even after he resigned, and he said . that his June 2011 departure from Congress was not the end to his . inappropriate behavior. 'She . knew all along this process as I was more and more honest with her, I . told her everything so this is something we knew going into this season . of (campaigning). 'I'm pleased and blessed that she has . given me a second chance. For the past several months I have asked New . Yorkers to give me a second chance. 'Its . in our rear view mirror but it's not far and we continue to work on our . marriage. Frankly we're in a lot better place today or else I would not . have run for mayor.' Many public figures have come out to support Abedin, praising her remarks at the press conference, including Donald Trump who called her 'impressive'. Congressman Charles Rangel, who has . been the Democratic representative for Harlem for over 40 years, echoed those sentiments on MSNBC Wednesday morning. 'Nobody . that I know understands at all what Anthony Weiner was thinking about. And right now, I think you would agree that we all are concerned about . his wife. She's a brave lady,' Congressman Rangel told MSNBC on . Wednesday. 'I have seen . a lot of things like this in politics where males have to lean on their . wives for support, but I don't ever recall seeing a wife looking and . feeling so sad and embarrassed, because Huma is a very private person, a . very delicate, sophisticated person. And all the years that I've known . her, putting her into this political situation, as bright and as . intelligent as she is, is very awkward.' In . spite of her claims that his sexual proclivities are a personal matter, . they have made a very purposeful- and planned- re-entry into public life . with a number of interviews. The first came in the June 30, 2012 issue of People Magazine, where they posed for a family portrait and Weiner opened up about how they had worked through their problems. On the sidelines: Huma Abedin has been working for Hillary Clinton (pictured here in 2012 when she was serving as Secretary of State) since 1996 and is considered one of her top aides . Now the 'normal family' that they claimed to be is seen as even more of a facade as it was revealed yesterday that he began exchanging explicit messages and photos with a woman online less than two weeks after the People issue hit newsstands. He would not go into the specifics of . when he began talking with the woman who has since been revealed as . Sydney Leathers, but she told gossip site The Dirty that their first . contact took place on July 12, 2012. To . many that came as a shock because it was assumed that his inappropriate . behavior came to a stop after he resigned from Congress in June 2011. Leathers . was revealed to be a blogger for the Indiana Progressive Liberals who . worked as a part of President Obama's field campaign during his 2012 bid . for re-election. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . The latest woman: Syndey Leathers, 23, was identified as the one who Weiner was talking to online in 2012 . Virtual exchange: She released screengrabs of their conversations and pictures of his genitals that he sent . She sent screenshots of conversations she had with Weiner over social media site Formspring, where he used the screenname 'Carlos Danger' and described his sexual fantasies, such as: 'So I walk in to a hotel room and you are at the end of the bed. naked except for some amazing f*** me shoes. your legs are ******. your feet are flat on the ground you are leaning slightly forward. looking completely in charge.' Photos: The Dirty also released two pictures that the unidentified woman claimed Weiner sent her of his genitals . 'I like to whisper in your ear while I make love to you. That ok?' he wrote. 'Taking a shower. Wanna join me?' 'Staring at pics of u. Pathetic?' 'If I met you in a bar and tried to talk to you, would I have a chance?' 'You are a walking fantasy.' The publisher of The Dirty is Nik Ritchie, who wrote Tuesday that the then-unidentified woman has hired a lawyer 'in fear of Anthony Weiner but she is willing to expose his sexual nature to TheDirty.com for the betterment of America'. She released a statement through the site: 'Although I was 22 and technically an adult, I was obviously immature and I acted irresponsibly. I realize my correspondence with Mr Anthony Weiner was a huge mistake and I am embarrassed by it.'","Huma Abedin spoke out publicly supporting her husband on Tuesday in light of a new set of sex chats with a woman online .

Hill is now wheelchair bound for months to come and the man who landed on him could face criminal charges. 'There was a guy on my lap': A man jumped from a bridge just as Andy Hill (pictured) floated by on the river below, breaking both Hill's legs .

'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry': A sign on the Bandmann Bridge clearly reads 'no jumping,' now Hill and the man who did so anyway know why. 'He kept apologizing' said Hill . Shattered: Now Hill will spend the rest of the summer in a wheelchair and on crutches as his cracked femur, calf bones, and knee ligaments heal . ‘Suddenly I had intense pain and I was under water,’ said Hill. ‘Somebody had jumped off the bridge and landed on me.’ Fishabilities: Hill is upbeat in spite of his injuries. The social worker works with disabled people regularly and is now experiencing it personally. The avid fisherman also has a non-profit aimed at teaching the disabled to fish called Fishabilities . As . silly as the accident sounds, Hill is in terrible pain and can barely . use crutches to get around, so he mostly stays in his wheelchair. ‘He rolled off my lap and he just kept apologizing, ”I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.”’ Police are now investigating the incident, which occurred where county signage clearly reads ‘Loitering on, fishing, diving, or jumping from bridge prohibited.’ Though authorities say the jumper may have received injuries as well, he now faces potential criminal endangerment charges. Meanwhile, Hill is trying to stay upbeat in the face of such an absurd injury. ‘Who does this happen to,’ he laughed. ‘I don't know of anybody this has ever happened to.’ Hill does, however, know of people who have faced other physical disabilities through his job in social work.

From the moment her acting career took off as Megan Jones on Saved by the Bell in 1993, Hollywood actress Bianca Lawson has retained a youthful presence on television screens. For more than 17 years, Lawson has been regularly cast to play a teenage role, despite being twice as old as some of the more recent characters she has played. The 34-year-old from Los Angeles has appeared in several TV series set in American high schools, from Dawson's Creek and Pretty Little Liars, to the Secret Life of Teenagers. Scroll down for video . Class of 93: Bianca Lawson's first big role was in Saved by the Bell: The New Class . Fight club: Lawson joined the cast of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in 1998 . In all of them she was cast as a 17-year-old, or teenager of a similar age, according to Gawker. Her first school role was on Saved by the Bell: The New Class, where she played the brainy Megan Jones from September 1993, when she was 14, to December 1994. After graduating from TV's Bayside High School, Lawson moved on to Sister Sister, another school series, in 1996. In 1997 she stayed in school, but added the first of several supernatural twists, as she joined the cast of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She took over the role of being a slayer for three episodes after Buffy, played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, briefly died, according to Buzzfeed. After leaving the demons of Sunnydale school behind, Lawson attended the set of Smart Guy, where she played another teenager from 1997 to 1999, before leaving to join the cast of Dawson's Creek. In the popular series, which starred Katie Holmes and James Van Der Beek, Lawson played student film director Nikki Green, from 1999  to 2000. Series of students: The actress joined the cast of Dawson's Creek in 2000 . Old school: In The Secret Life of the American Teenager, Lawson played a 23-year-old dating a student . Undead: While playing ghost Emily in the Vampire Diaries, Lawson did not have to worry about her character aging . But, by 2001, Lawson had swapped the Massachusetts setting of Dawson's Creek for Chicago to play Nikki in Save the Last Dance. Perhaps bored of being typecast as a 17-year-old, Lawson's next role involved her playing a 23-year-old who was dating a high school student in the Secret Life of Teenagers. Her character eventually ditched the boyfriend because he was too young. However, Lawson soon reverted to playing a younger character, after being cast as the ghost of Emily Bennett on the Vampire Diaries in 2009, and then Maya St Germain in Pretty Little Liars. White lie: Lawson was in her early 30s when she played a schoolgirl in Pretty Little Liars . The graduate: She may have left the student roles behind but Lawson is still in school for Teen Wolf . She was 31 when she joined the cast of Pretty Little Liars in 2010, but her character remained a teenager until she left the show in 2012. Finally, at the age of 34, Lawson has managed to act her age, but the school setting remains. She is currently playing Ms Morell, a French teacher and guidance counselor in MTV's Teen Wolf.","From Saved by the Bell to Pretty Little Liars, 34-year-old has played series of teenage students .

A breed of parrot has been shown to be as clever as a child of four when it comes to making long term decisions proving their species don't, as is often assumed, just learn parrot-fashion. Scientists found the captive bred Goffin's cockatoo is able to resist the temptation of eating an immediate food item in order to trade it for a better reward down the line. This mirrored a famous experiment in the U.S. 40 years ago when nursery school children were put in a room and given a marshmallow, biscuit or pretzel stick. They could either eat it right away or wait 15 minutes and get an extra treat. The captive bred Goffin's cockatoo can resist the temptation of eating an immediate food item in order to trade it for a better reward in the future . Tracking them over time those with the . ability to wait got better grades, were healthier, enjoyed greater . professional success and proved better at staying in relationships - . even decades after they took the test. They were, in short, better at . life. The ability to . anticpate a delayed gain is considered mentally challenging since it . requires not just the capacity to control a direct impulse but also to . assess the gain's beneficial value against the cost of having to wait . and the reliability of the trader. Psychologists say such aptitude could be considered signs of economic decision making and are rarely found outside humans. Just . a few, typically large brained animals, have been found able to refuse . an immediate snack for a bigger one for more than a minute. But . the Indonesian cockatoo, which hit the headlines last year by . spontaneously making and using 'tools' to reach food, has now managed . it, reports the Royal Society journal Biology Letters. Isabelle Laumer, of the University of Vienna, said: 'The animals were allowed to pick up an initial food item and given the opportunity to return it directly into the experimenter's hand after an increasing time delay. The University of Vienna study mirrored a famous experiment in the U.S. forty years ago when nursery school childrens were put in a room and given a marshmallow, biscuit or pretzel stick . Pieces of eight: Psychologists say such aptitude could be considered signs of economic decision making and are rarely found outside humans . 'If the initial food item had not been nibbled by this time, the bird received another reward of an even higher preferred food type or of a larger quantity than the initial food in exchange. 'Although we picked pecan nuts as the initial reward which were highly liked by the birds and would under normal circumstances be consumed straightaway, we found all 14 of the birds waited for food of higher quality, such as a cashew nut, for up to 80 seconds.' Study co-author Dr Alice Auersperg said the Goffins acted 'astonishingly like economic agents', trading off between immediate and future benefits. She said: 'While human infants or primates can hold the initial food in their hands, one should also consider the birds were able to wait although they had to hold the food in their beaks, directly against their taste organs while waiting. 'Imagine placing a cookie directly into a toddler's mouth and telling him or her they will only receive a piece of chocolate if the cookie is not nibbled for over a minute.' Another of the researchers Professor Thomas Bugnyar has carried out similar studies on ravens and crows. He added: 'Until recently, birds were considered to lack any self control. When we found corvids could wait for delayed food, we speculated which socioecological onditions could favour the evolution of such skills. 'To test our ideas we needed clever birds that are distantly related to corvids. Parrots were the obvious choice and the results on Goffins show we are on the right track.'","Captive bred Goffin's cockatoo able to resist temptation of eating .

Lee Ellis, 39, stole roof tiles and lead flashing from the home of his former partner and two children . A father-of-two who literally stole the roof over his children's heads by stealing tiles and lead from their house has walked free from court. Unemployed Lee Ellis, 39, climbed up on to the roof of former partner Jill Slater's house in Castleford, West Yorkshire, in the early hours of the morning and removed the tiles and lead flashing. Ms Slater was was asleep at the property with their three-year-old twins and her 15-year-old daughter from a previous relationship when she awoke to footsteps on the roof. She rang police and then looked out the window - coming face to face with her former partner as he climbed down from the roof. Ellis fled the scene on foot but was caught by police officers after a brief chase following the theft on June 18. Wakefield Magistrates Court heard the tiles had been stacked up on the roof and a large quantity of lead flashing was found on the ground outside the house. Lisa Evans, prosecuting, told the court Miss Slater had to claim £3,500 from her insurance company for the damage Ellis caused to her home. She said: 'It sounded like rubble falling down and then footsteps. She was afraid and went in to her older daughter's room, who was also afraid.' Mitigating at the hearing yesterday, Craig Sutcliffe said his client had taken sleeping tablets and had little recollection of the incident. He said: 'He had no intention to cause upset to his own children or the mother of his children. The break up with Miss Slater was difficult for Mr Ellis. 'It wasn't a situation where there was a clean break between them, that's inevitable when there are children in the family. 'Also, despite the fact that they split up some time ago, they have periodically got back together which has perhaps led to a state of confusion about whether the relationship was truly over. In court: Ellis pleaded guilty to theft at Wakefield Magistrates Court, pictured, yesterday . Lee Ellis, pictured leaving Wakefield Magistrates Court, was sentenced to a 12-month community sentence . 'This was the final realisation that it was over. Whilst this was unpleasant for Miss Slater, at least it was someone who was familiar to her. 'There is no suggestion of the defendant using or threatening any violence towards her that night. 'He accepts that having removed them the most likely thing he would have done is sold them. He can only put it down to the sleeping tablets.' Ellis, of Castleford, admitted theft when he appeared at a previous hearing earlier this month. Bench chairman James Rollings-Spink sentenced Ellis to a 12-month community order with a 30-day activity requirement plus supervision for 12 months. Mr Rollings-Spink told Ellis that he must pay Miss Slater £150 compensation plus £85 towards prosecution costs and a £60 victim surcharge. He was also handed a 12 month restraining order, which bans him from contacting Miss Slater directly or indirectly. Ellis was told that he can only contact Miss Slater via a third party regarding their children.","Unemployed Lee Ellis climbed on to roof at ex's home in middle of the night .

A judge has agreed to postpone the punishment of a thief who stole cash from Help for Heroes - so the yob can go on holiday to Ibiza. Ashley Tonks, 19, collected donations for the charity at an Asda supermarket fundraiser but pocketed the cash. Magistrates sentenced him to 250 hours of unpaid work but he was unable to complete the final 100 hours after injuring himself in a motorcycle crash. His punishment was replaced with an extended curfew order which would have encroached onto two sunshine holidays which Tonks had already booked. But the lout persuaded District Judge Martin Brown at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court to let him enjoy a week-long break in Britain and eight days in Ibiza before he starts his curfew. Unrepentant Tonks, from Tuffley, Gloucester, claimed the curfew 'means nothing to me'. He said: 'I'm not a bad person, I made a mistake and I took a hit for it. 'I'm going on holiday on Saturday and then going away with the missus. If I was a bad person, surely they wouldn't have done that.'

Prince George of Cambridge is expected to live up to eight years longer than babies born in other parts of the country on the same day, new figures show. Newborns in Westminster, home of St Mary’s Hospital where the prince was delivered on Monday, have a life expectancy of 81.2 years compared to just 73.8 years in Blackpool. The dramatic difference in life chances was laid bare by the Office for National Statistics, which warned of a ‘north-south divide’ in the chance of reaching old age. Long life: New data shows wide variations between the longest life expectancy, shown in dark purple, and shortest, in light purple . Latest data released today shows male life expectancy at birth was highest in East Dorset at 83 years in 2009-2011, an incredible 9.2 years higher than in Blackpool. In Kensington and Chelsea, where William and Kate plan to have their family home in Kensington Palace, baby boys are predicted to live to 81.6 years. The Cambridges were safely tucked away in . a small cottage in Kensington Palace's grounds today, with the only . sign of movement this morning being a royal protection officer walking . their dog Ludo nearby.

'The distribution of life expectancy in England was characterised by a north-south divide, with life expectancy generally being lower among local areas in the north of the country,' the ONS said. For females, life expectancy at birth was also highest in East Dorset at 86.4 years and lowest in Manchester where females could expect to live for 79.3 years. 'These differences were statistically significant,' the ONS added. Life expectancy for baby girls ranged from 86.4 years in East Dorset to the lowest in Manchester where females could expect to live for 79.3 years . In 2009-11, the difference in male life expectancy between the highest and lowest figures stood at 9.2 years and 7.1 years for baby girls, but there had not been a significant changer since 2005–07. However in some areas life expectancy has fallen. In Rushmoor, Hampshire male life expectancy fell by 0.2 years but rose by 2.9 years in Camden.

Believe me, it’s the place to be — not the slightest bit exclusive, but with terrific benefits. From now on, I guarantee, you’ll have a fresh take on life and love. Nowadays, grandmotherhood doesn’t conjure up pictures of white-haired old  ladies in rocking chairs. You and I are more likely to be in jeans and funky boots. Proud: Carole and Michael Middleton, the parents of Kate, smile as they arrive at St. Mary's Hospital . Thrilled: Both beamed with pride following their visit . But still, this is a brand new phase of life. Suddenly, middle age becomes magnificent. Becoming a grandparent is an astonishing transformation, no matter who you are. It happened to me last year when my grandson was born in June and my granddaughter in September. Yes, two came along and I’m amazed by the way the small people have changed my life. I’m not just referring to the inevitable demands on time and attention, but a jolt into a different way of being. You’ll find out now. Already you’ve made a brilliant start. Most grandmothers rush eagerly to the hospital as soon as they can, but you wisely held back on the first day, knowing just how much William and Catherine wanted that quiet, private time with their new son. When you walked into the Lindo Wing at last, you saw the eyes (and lenses) of the world focused on seeing the royal baby — who is also, first and foremost, your grandson. Grandmother knows best: The Duchess of Cambridge pictured earlier this year with her mother Carole Middleton buying a baby cot . Useful: Bel Mooney with daughter Kitty and baby Chloe . It must have been daunting as well as exciting to realise how important your role will be in helping to shape his young life. I remember my mother telling me that when you have your own child, you’re young, busy and stressed, but when grandchildren arrive, you have changed. You’re calmer, wiser and ready to give that precious commodity: time. More than that, grandmotherhood can involve a subtle shift in your personality. Obviously, this doesn’t work for all women. But it has for me. Nature has designed older females for a vital role within the family. Our child-bearing years are over and we possess the confidence of middle age, knowing who and what we are, with nothing to prove. Now is the perfect moment to assume the all-important mantle of The Grandmother. Mind you, the transformation is gradual. Of course, I made all the obvious noises of delight when the babies were born and naturally felt proud and excited. But you don’t necessarily fall in love with your grandchildren overnight. Initially, your thoughts will be with your daughter — your own baby — wanting her to be happy, to cope, to grow into the role of parent and perform it brilliantly. Then you look at the little bundle in your arms and realise this strange new creature is about to make demands on you — and for years. That can make you anxious. I found myself wondering if I could be as competent, energetic and self-sacrificing as my parents were when I had my children, Dan and Kitty. Delighted: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their newborn son depart the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital . Content: The couple could barely contain their happiness as they showed their new born baby off to the world . What if I didn’t want to sit on the floor with a baby and a pile of plastic bricks? Would I (yuk!) get used to stinky nappies all over again? I hoped I’d grow into the role, but felt nervous. Maybe you feel that way, too. The first lesson I learned was to keep quiet. Having brought up our own children, you and I think we know what we’re doing. But woe betide you if a view escapes your lips unasked for! Believe me, your daughter (yes, even serene Kate) will soon put you in your place. The first time I took care of my granddaughter for the evening, I fed her and changed her nappy, then put her back in the wrong place in the crib. Imagine! I had to bite my tongue when Kitty demanded to know why. Remember, new mums are anxious. If the first rule of grandmotherhood is not to say ‘I did it this way’ or ask ‘Why do you need to do that?’, the second rule is not to bridle. Don’t endlessly bleat over the baby and blurt out opinions. This is their gig, not ours! That’s what I mean by a subtle shift in your personality. Even a control freak like me (and, I suspect, you) has to learn to step back. When Catherine wants advice, she might ask for it, but sometimes you’ll feel irritated because she doesn’t realise she jolly well needs it. Even if you murmur something loving, such as ‘Sweetie, don’t worry quite so much — it’ll be fine’, you’ll be wounded if she bites your head off. So step back and save yourself a stab of pain. And when you make mistakes, just shrug and be relaxed. The new parents make the rules about food and bedtime, and we have to obey them. With all the pressure on Catherine, it would be astonishing if in private she remains as unflappable as she seems in public. So it’s all the more important for you, as her mother, to be calm and quiet.Minimum instruction, but maximum reassurance. Our daughters need strong support and don’t want us to neglect them in favour of the baby. It seems to me essential to remember that you are Mum first and Grandmother second. That’s why it’s important to tell your daughter how well she is doing as she gradually learns to play the most important role in the world: being a mother. Praise her. She’ll need it. But above all — enjoy! As I write this, ten-month-old Chloe is on my knee because her mum, my daughter, is at an evening course and her husband is helping to bring in hay bales from our field. To type this, I’m trying to reach around baby, who keeps banging the keyboard, so I have to delete her contributions. It’s hilarious. Once, I’d have been frustrated by such a scene and want someone — anyone — to take the baby. Now, though, it makes me laugh. I can’t tell you the delight of realising you want to work less and play more. That’s the glorious thing about the Cool Grandmother Club — it’s a passport to optimism and fun.I’ve even learned to love that irritating pad of middle-aged spread on my hips, because I see what it’s for: a perfect seat for a baby. There’s a new sense of usefulness and of youth, too. In a moment, I will change Chloe’s nappy, give her a bottle and put her to bed — and I can’t wait for a goodnight cuddle. The smell of my grandchildren’s heads takes me back to being a young mother . . . and so life moves in a wonderful arc. I feel completed — and I hope you do, too. What else is there to say? Just this: that no matter his status from birth, the relentless public scrutiny or what the future holds, when snuggled in your arms he is just a lovely baby and you are just a normal, proud grandmother. Build a fortress around that private love, Carole. He will need it.","Duchess of Cambridge's parents celebrating their first grandchild .

When the police car pulled up alongside the trio, Miles fired the Colt .45 revolver at the officers. Scroll down for video . Opening fire: The three gangsters shoot the weapon in Hackney, east London, moments before the unmarked police car sped away . Fortunately none of the officers were harmed as the bullet hit the ground in front of the vehicle. Miles tried a second time to fire at the police but the weapon jammed. He then pointed it threateningly at the officers. PC Richard Gilbert, who was in the car, put the vehicle into reverse as Miles continued to point the gun at them before the gang cycled away. CCTV footage showed the three males . firing at the car. The trio, said to be affiliated with the . Certified Southwold Road gang in Hackney, then abandoned their bikes and . threw away the weapon before fleeing over a footbridge on January 10, . 2012. Jailed: Ricardo Miles, left, who fired the weapon, was given 13 years in prison while Adebola Alimi, right, was ordered to serve 12 years . Ikemulo also dropped an open-lock knife at the scene, less than half a mile from the Olympic Park. The colt .45 revolver was found with . six rounds, two fired and four live rounds in it unfired. The judge concluded that the other fired round was a practice shot some weeks beforehand. They attempted to remove gunshot residue from their bodies later that night by entering a sauna in Kentish Town. They were arrested in May 2012 after a long police investigation. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard they were hunting down members of the rival Gilpin Square Gang when the officers approached. Sentenced: Daniel Ikumelo was given 11 years and 11 months for his role in the 'joint enterprise' All three were found guilty of possessing a colt calibre revolver with the intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition and possessing a knife following a trial. Judge Neil Sanders, passing sentence, said: 'There was no lawful reason for you to have that weapon. 'There was a real risk of injury to not only the police officers but also residents as this was done in a residential area. 'Here, the intention was to endanger life and to use the weapon when the occasion rose as demonstrated by when it was fired in the context of gang rivalry. 'You three were associated to the Certified Southwould Road gang and set out to attack members of a rival gang. 'I assess you all to be dangerous. This was clearly a joint enterprise and you knew what weapons to use and if they were available. 'Happily no injuries were caused to anybody on this occasion.' Peter Rowlands, defending Miles, said: . 'He is not a hardened criminal. As a young boy at school he was doing . well and has quite a substantial record of achievement. 'If you look at the reports it gives . you an insight into Miles that he is still a young man of promise and is . devoted to his family.' Alistair Fell, defending Ikumelo, . said: 'This is somebody who has demonstrated commitment to his family . and has had a positive impact on younger family members. 'He is fortunate to still have the support of his family and he is still a young man at only 22. 'There was an intervening event when . he was the victim of a stabbing and this had significant impact on his . development. Prior to that incident he was not known to the courts.' Arlette Piercey, defending Alimi, . said: 'He has found it difficult to come to terms with the jury's . verdict and still thinks the jury got it wrong. 'He became a father at 17 and did not . shy from those responsibilities but instead became very involved, taking . her to school every day before working at night. 'The mother of the daughter does not think seeing Alimi in custody is a place for a child and so she has cut off ties with him.' Alimi, who came to this country aged six, is not a UK citizen and faces deportation.

But as they plan for the huge life change a newborn brings to any family, no matter how wealthy or how blue the blood, one things is for sure: Kate and Wills will be doing this very differently from previous generations of Royals. The two are said to be planning to break with the long standing tradition of a . formal nanny (or many nannies) taking control of childcare in the Royal household. Instead . they advertised for a housekeeper to help with multiple household . chores and help watch the Royal baby, with Kate and William expecting to . do much of the hands on care taking themselves. Scroll down for video . Traditional, highly trained Norland Nannies have served the Royal family for generations, but Kate and William are said to have advertised for a housekeeper in lieu of a traditional nanny . And, of course, Kate plans to spend the first six weeks of the baby's life at her parents' Buckinghamshire mansion, meaning she will have the 24-hour assistance of her very able mother. Previously . nannies were a huge part of the lives of royal children, with Prince . Charles, for instance, raised almost exclusively by a team of highly trained nannies. Charles had two main nannies, Nurse . Helen Lightbody and Mabel Anderson, who were surrogate mothers to him . throughout his childhood. At . the time - he was born in 1948 - a nanny was expected to do much of the hands on child . rearing, with parents playing a far less hands-on role than we would . expect today. Children . of the upper classes were expected to be presented to their parents by . the nanny, neat and clean and on their best behaviour. And the Royals were no exception. Indeed, the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, was not present at Charles' first three birthdays. And although that may sound harsh by today's standards, it would have . been the norm at the time, especially given the pressure of her Royal . duties. Prince Charles . was supported by his nanny, Mabel Anderson, when his parents went on a . six month tour when he was three years old. He later credited his nanny for . providing critical emotional support in his early childhood years and . beyond. Prince William in his pushchair with his nanny Olga Powell in Regent's Park in London in 1984. Despite growing up with a full-time nanny, William and his wife Kate are not to employ full-time help . Princess Diana leaves Lorenzo's with William and Harry and nanny Olga Powell: William's nanny helped him through the difficult time of his parents divorce . When it came to his own children, Charles and, of course, Diana, were much more involved on a daily basis wherever possible, . although they still employed two nannies, Olga Powell and Barbara Barnes. Olga Powell, from the prestigious Norland College, stayed . with the family for over 15 years. The formidable pair - of whom the . children were incredibly fond - reportedly took the young William to . parks in London in 'secret', in 'civilian' clothing and with just a . single security guard, to give him as many normal childhood experiences . as possible. Olga . Powell cared for both William and Prince Harry when they were young boys, . including the difficult period when their parents' marriage was breaking . up in the early 1990s. William was devastated when Olga died in 2012, and cancelled numerous engagements to be able to attend her funeral. As a child, the . Queen’s nanny, Clara Knight (affectionately known as Allah) would have . been staffed by a team of nursemaids, under-nurses and chambermaids, . with the Royal nanny dedicating her time to being with the children and . overseeing their strict daily routine. Later . Marion Crawford joined the royal household as Governess, a role that . incorporated private tutoring, some of the duties of a nanny and as a . companion. In a modern twist on the nanny role, Marion was in training to be a child psychologist when she accepted the post. At just nine months old, Elizabeth’s . parents went on a six month tour of Australia and New Zealand leaving her . behind with her nanny. During . this period the nanny would have been required to send regular updates . of Elizabeth’s progress detailing significant events. Via post one such letter accompanied by a . photograph of a smiling Elizabeth dated 8 March 1927 stated: 'If Mummy . looks into my mouth with a little magnifying glass she will see my two . teeth. Elizabeth; quite well and happy!'' Rosemary . Albone, a Norland-educated nanny and adviser to nanny firm Care.com told . MailOnline in a recent interview how much the role of baby care-giver has changed from Queen Elizabeth to Prince . Charles, and how much it will go on to transition as William takes on a parenting role to his own son or daughter. She . said: ‘With news that the royal couple have recently reported a job . advert showing they are looking for a housekeeper, perhaps they are . moving with the times and going for a modern approach to childcare. Princess Anne and Prince Charles are whisked away from Buckingham Palace by their nannies after Anne's Christening in 1950 . Prince Charles -waving to bystanders - and his sister Princess Anne are taken by their nanny into Marlborough House with bouquets of flowers to call upon their great-grandmother, Queen Mary, on her 84th birthday in 1951 . 'With . roles including walking the dog, polishing silverware, driving the car . and watching the baby, the new all-encompassing housekeeper is a million . miles away from the type of care that previous royalty have received.’ Ms . Albone explains that the role of the Royal nanny has dramatically . changed in parallel with the evolution of the Royal family themselves. The Royals have modernised their opinions about the needs of their children and how . they view themselves, their influence as parents, and the interaction they wish for. Ms Albone explains that ‘broad shoulders and a tough skin were . necessary attributes to cope with the amount of opinion shared about the . quality of the job [nannies] were doing by many members of the royal . family and the public’. Princess Anne's son, Peter Phillips, on his way to nursery school with his nanny, Mabel Anderson in 1980 (right) Ms Albone says: ‘The role . of the Royal nanny would have been a tricky one to get right in terms . of relationships; needing to acknowledge that the children may well see . their nanny as a central and significant figure in their lives and . someone who they could rely on to always be there; yet also someone who . would never outshine the central and influential role of the parent. Speaking about the arrival of . William’s own son or daughter, Ms Albone said: ‘Much has been speculated . about the appointment of a Royal nanny and whether that role will be . full or part-time, but what’s important is that whoever is charged to . look after the little one will know the child and the parents’ preferences very well. ‘This blending of care is a skill that . the nanny will need to be an expert at; making sure that their practice . is guided by the Duke and Duchess’ ideas and wishes primarily. ‘As . with previous Royal nannies, the new Royal baby’s carer will be . expected to have qualifications and experience and be knowledgeable . about current issues and how these can be interpreted to benefit the . child and family.’ Devoted Royal nanny Barbara Barnes carries Prince William onto a plane at the start of the six week royal tour of Australia in 1983 . Nannies have traditionally always helped royal mothers: Queen Elizabeth holds Prince Charles hand while a nanny carries Princess Anne as they catch a train to Balmoral to rejoin H.M. the King and Queen and Princess Margaret in 1950 .

BUT WILLS AND HARRY GOT 'SOFTER TOUCH' The Norland nannies are easily recognisable from their distinctive brown uniform, which is strictly enforced . The tradition of nannies in the Royal household . goes back centuries.

Famed . for their strict old-fashioned brown uniform, Norland nannies are . considered to be some of the best in the world, and some of the most . expensive. In terms of . the hierarchy of staff within royal households during the Queen’s . childhood, nannies sat relatively near the top spot. However . the position could be a lonely one, as the role fell between the rest . of the household staff and they were considered neither ‘upstairs’ nor . ‘downstairs’. An . obsession with rigid routines  - believed then to be essential for . every child – means that most nannies were expected to put their lives . on hold and dedicate themselves to a family that was not their own. Although . the majority of royal nannies remained single, they were always . addressed as ‘Mrs’ to acknowledge their position and to show respect.

A mother who is suing a prestigious London private school has been accused of 'ranting' at meetings and criticising teachers in an aggressive attempt to push up her children's grades. The woman sent teachers a flood of letters and emails about her children's education, a court heard - including a complaint when her six-year-old daughter received only 19 out of 20 on her spelling test. She is also alleged to have filed complaints about trivial issues such as a fight over a glue stick and water bottles being placed too near pupils' shoes. Claim: The High Court, pictured, has heard that a mother acted aggressively towards teachers at a top London private school . The mother and her husband, a businessman, are seeking £50,000 in damages from the school in West London, claiming teachers backtracked on a deal to give their children good references after they were withdrawn from the institution. At a High Court hearing, the school's barrister Jonathan Auburn said that the woman had acted in a 'rude and inappropriate manner - including insisting on interrupting staff when in the middle of meetings, speaking over people, haranguing them, and on occasion screaming at them'. He added: 'She placed oppressive expectations on her children of constant outstanding achievement, and would admonish both child and school if her full expectations were not always met.' The woman, who cannot be identified, allegedly pursued 'trenchant complaints' over unimportant matters, such as bottles of water being positioned too closely to muddy pairs of shoes. Mr Auburn asked her, 'Do you think - with hindsight - that that was quite a trivial matter?', but she replied: 'It was a matter of hygiene.' Fight: The school, not pictured, is accused of back-tracking on a deal it made when three children were withdrawn (file photo) On one occasion, the court heard, the mother complained that her nine-year-old son had been given an A rather than an A+ for a geography project. 'It was good but not good enough,' she said, adding that some children who achieved an A+ had failed to include a contents page in their essay . Mr Auburn asked: 'So your child got an A and you wrote in to raise that with the school, to say he should have got an A+, and you don't see anything odd about that?' - she replied, 'No.' He told the hearing that the school had no problems with the children themselves, but felt forced to ask the parents to remove them thanks to the adults' 'particularly poor behaviour'. The parents withdrew their children from the school, which cannot be named for legal reasons, and are now seeking damages for alleged breach of contract as well as an injunction barring the school from discussing them with any other school. They claim they struck a deal with the school after a 'stormy' meeting in which the headmaster promised to provide a good reference to any school the children applied to. But instead he told another head that the parents had 'harassed' him, the court heard. Both parents deny behaving unreasonably towards staff, insisting they were doing their utmost to ensure their children's needs were met by teachers. The mother said the school failed to communicate adequately with her and she only pursued issues where she felt teachers were not responding to her children's needs. She had become particularly concerned by the school's failure to provide her with her offspring's test results, she told the court. Friction between the parents and the school came to a head at a parents' meeting which left staff 'visibly shaken' and finished with the couple 'storming out', Mr Auburn alleged. However, the father denied claims that he and his wife were 'aggressive and intimidating' at the meeting, insisting the atmosphere was 'always polite and courteous even if we disagreed'. The hearing continues.","Mother allegedly complained about trivial issues and acted aggressively .

Warning: Sir David Manning has told David Cameron that leaving the EU would condemn Britain to 'irrelevance' on the world stage . One of Prince William’s key advisers has warned David Cameron that leaving the EU would condemn Britain to ‘irrelevance’ on the world stage. Sir David Manning, who briefed Tony Blair over the Iraq War, accompanies the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on overseas tours advising on foreign policy. But in a move that could put the Royal Family on a collision course with the Government, Sir David has challenged Mr Cameron’s willingness to put Britain’s place in the EU up for grabs. The Prime Minister has pledged to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels and then  hold an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. Mr Cameron has made clear that if he does not  get a good deal he is prepared  to campaign for Britain to leave  the EU. Yesterday he warned  that public support for the EU is ‘wafer thin’. But in a submission to the Government’s EU review, Sir David – a former British ambassador in Washington – warned that pulling out would undermine Britain’s standing with its allies. He wrote: ‘Outside the EU, our influence in Europe would be sharply diminished – but so it would be in the United States. The risk to the UK of leaving the European Union is of a rapid drift into international irrelevance. ‘Compelling economic arguments are made for the UK’s membership of the European Union, not least the importance of the single market in which we do almost half our trade. ‘But equally compelling are  the strategic, security and diplomatic interests served by UK membership, interests that would be seriously jeopardised were we to leave the EU.’ He claimed that America looks to the EU as its ‘natural partner’ and believes that Britain’s role is enhanced as a member. But  President Obama has already given his tentative approval to Mr Cameron’s plans. Key figure: Sir David is pictured with Tony Blair, President George W Bush and then security adviser Condoleezza Rice on a visit to the US in 2002 . The comments come after the Daily Mail revealed how a Foreign Office report – saying EU membership was beneficial – was branded a whitewash by critics. Yesterday, Mr Cameron insisted that Britain will win a new deal  in the EU because countries in the euro need to become ‘more integrated’ to solve their economic problems. He said: ‘I’m saying, ‘‘You need to sort your stuff out – and we’ll allow you to do that because you need to.” But at the same time those countries like Britain where, frankly, consent for the EU is wafer thin, we need changes too.’ Settling the issue: David Cameron, pictured at the Bentley factory in Crewe, says a referendum would solve the EU issue for a generation . Speaking at a question and answer session in Crewe, he added: ‘I believe we can achieve a better settlement for Britain in Europe and then put that to the people in a referendum in 2017. I believe we’d be able to settle this issue for a generation.’ Sir David was at Mr Blair’s side in the run-up to the Iraq War in 2003 as his chief foreign policy adviser and gave evidence to the Chilcot Inquiry. He revealed that Mr Blair drew up secret plans for the invasion nine months before the outbreak of war. But he urged caution on Mr Blair, telling the inquiry that he thought Britain should not have gone to war without a second UN resolution and that weapons inspectors should have ‘been given longer’ to search for WMD. He also expressed doubts that the war was worth the cost in ‘blood and treasure’. Sir David’s views are significant since he has acted as an unpaid adviser on foreign affairs to Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge since 2009. Leading Eurosceptic Tory MP Peter Bone last night urged Prince William to seek advice from a broader range of advisers. He said: ‘Sir David has provided the establishment view, which is palpable nonsense and totally out of touch with what ordinary people think. ‘They want us to be a small part of a European superstate, but we’ll be a more important country in the world if we are an independent country with our own foreign policy. ‘I hope royalty from the Queen down will listen to a range of views and realise what ordinary people are saying.’","Sir David Manning challenged David Cameron over his willingness to put Britain's EU place up for grabs .

Jane Austen is to become the face of the new £10 note after a public outcry that every banknote featured a man. New Bank of England governor Mark Carney today unveiled the new design as a tribute to ‘one of the greatest writers in English literature’ which will appear from 2017. The move comes after the Bank faced criticism that a plan for Winston Churchill to feature on the new fiver meant there would not be a woman on any English note. Tenner: The Bank of England today released this image of the new £10 note featuring Jane Austen, which should come into circulation from 2017 . Honour: Bank of England of Mark Carney unveiled the new £10 note after bowing to critics who complained that it was ignoring women as candidates to be featured on the bank notes . After a public clamour to ensure a female face continued to appear on banknotes, former Bank of England governor Lord King hinted that Miss Austen was ‘waiting in the wings’ the next time a slot became available. His successor Mr Carney said the inclusion of the Pride and Prejudice author would complete a line-up of ‘diverse’ individuals honoured on notes. He said: ‘Jane Austen certainly merits a place in the select group of historical figures to appear on our banknotes. ‘Her novels have an enduring and universal appeal and she is recognised as one of the greatest writers in English literature. ‘As Austen joins Adam Smith, Boulton and Watt, and in future, Churchill, our notes will celebrate a diverse range of individuals who have contributed in a wide range of fields.’ All change: The Pride and Prejudice author will replace Charles Darwin on the reverse of the £10 note . Austen will be only the third woman to appear on banknotes, following prison reformer Elizabeth Fry who is being replaced by Winston Churchill on £5 notes and pioneering nurse Florence Nightingale, who was previously on £10 notes. The Austen £10 note will be issued within a year of the Churchill £5 note, which is exp[ected to be available from 2016, the Bank of England said. It will include the quite from Pride and Prejudice: ‘I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!’ Reading: The new Austen £10 note will extol the virtues of reading, in tribute to one of the great writers of English literature . Caroline Criado-Perez, who launched an online campaign to keep women on banknotes, said: . 'This is a brilliant day for women and a fantastic one for people power. 'To hear Jane Austen confirmed is fantastic, but to hear the process will be comprehensively reviewed is even better.' The design, released publicly for the first time today, also includes a portrait of Jane Austen. Which was commissioned by her nephew James Edward Austen Leigh and adapted from an original sketch of by her sister, Cassandra Austen. The central design is based on the 12-sided writing table and writing quills, used by Austen at Chawton Cottage. There is also an illustration of Miss Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist in Pride and Prejudice, undertaking ‘the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her’ – from a drawing by Isabel Bishop (1902-1988). The building feature on the notes is Godmersham Park, the home of Edward Austen Knight, Jane Austen's brother. She regularly visited the house which is thought to be the inspiration for a number of her novels. The Bank of England confirmed that the inclusion of Austen on the notes came after ‘concerns that have been raised recently about the diversity of characters on the notes’. A spokesman added: ‘We would like to provide reassurance that, as part of the rolling programme of note launches, it was never the Bank’s intention that none of the four characters on our notes would be a woman.’ Male dominated: The decision to replace prison reformer Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on the £5 note meant there would not have been a women on banknotes . As a result of the outcry, the Bank has ordered a review of the way it selects candidates to appear on notes. Chris . Salmon, the Bank’s executive director for banking services and chief . cashier, is to ‘refine the criteria for character selection, and . establish a process to ensure that potential candidates are consistently . judged against those criteria’. Mr Carney said: ‘We believe that our notes should celebrate the full diversity of great British historical figures and their contributions in a wide range of fields. ‘The Bank is committed to that objective, and we want people to have confidence in our commitment to diversity. That is why I am today announcing a review of the selection process for future banknote characters.’","Pride and Prejudice author to replace Charles Darwin on £10 note .

Before adjourning proceedings, she said a full inquest would examine all the circumstances leading up to the deaths and examine any 'failings... if they are identified'.

Witnesses on the day said they saw two soldiers 'clearly in distress' who pleaded with them for some drinking water. An inquest at Brecon Law Courts in Powys, mid Wales, gave the medical deaths of the pair as 'unascertained'. Speaking at the brief hearing was Dyfed Powys Police Detective Inspector Ieuan Wyn Jones. He said that L/Cpl Roberts had been pronounced dead on the mountain at . 5.15pm, while Mr Maher died at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil . almost three hours later. 'Post mortems have been carried out and the causes of death are unascertained,' he added. 'Further investigations are being carried out.' A third man who was also taken ill and airlifted to safety remains in hospital. Sources have said that L/Cpl Roberts and his colleague died from heat exhaustion on July 13 as temperatures hit 29.5C (85.1F). Witnesses . reported seeing a number of soldiers on the training exercise 'pleading . for water' for someone who seemed to 'be in distress'. It is believed the group had been taking part in the aptitude training element of the course to become SAS reservists. They had been tutored in how to survive in hostile territory and were embarking on the testing stage of the process. The Brecon Beacons is one of several locations used by the British military for training. Its rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and mentally for warfare, as well as putting their logistic skills to the test - making it an ideal area for elite forces personnel such as the SAS. Pen y Fan, the highest mountain in southern Britain, is home to the gruelling 'Fan Dance', which involves would-be special forces personnel marching up the mountain, down the other side and back again carrying a weighted pack and rifle - then doing the route in reverse in a set time. When news of the deaths broke, tributes poured in for former teaching assistant L/Cpl Roberts, of Penrhyn Bay, near Llandudno. The 24-year-old had reportedly served with the TA for more than five years, including tours of Iraq and Afghanistan. In a statement issued through the MoD, his father Kelvin Roberts said: “We are all devastated at the loss of our beloved Craig. 'This has left a massive hole in all our lives. 'We wholeheartedly supported Craig in his military endeavours and it gives us some comfort, though great sadness, that he died in the pursuit of his dream. 'Next month Craig was due to start a new post in the office of the Secretary of State for Education and we were all very proud of him.'","Edward Maher died alongside Lance Corporal Craig Roberts .

Labour's most powerful union baron last night threatened to slash funding to the party unless he is given even greater powers to dictate policy and impose candidates. Unite boss Len McCluskey, who has funded Ed Miliband to the tune of £8million, said he was sick of being ‘taken for granted by people who welcome our money, but not our policy input’. In a speech to union activists, he demanded that Labour shift further to the Left, saying he would not bankroll a party that was ‘a pinkish shadow of the present coalition’. Demands: Unite leader Len McCluskey warned the union would not longer hand over money to the Labour party without getting anything in return . Mr McCluskey, known as ‘Red Len’ for . his hard-Left views, attacked Mr Miliband’s handling of a vote-rigging . row in Falkirk, branding it an ‘utter, utter disgrace’. He said the row had brought relations . with the party to ‘breaking point’ and made it clear that funding is . likely to be cut as a result. Mr McCluskey warned that Labour’s . income, 85 per cent of which is provided by the unions, could shrink, . ‘possibly quite dramatically’. He would be demanding ‘enhanced . policy input’ and ‘more of an impact on Parliamentary selections’ if . Unite was to continue bankrolling the party. It marks an escalation in the . stand-off between the unions and Labour leader Ed Miliband who has moved . to shift the party’s relationship with its big money backer backers. Since Mr Miliband became leader in 2010 Unite has given £8.4million to the Labour party. But in the wake of the row over Unite allegedly trying to fix Labour’s candidate selection in Falkirk, he moved to overhaul the rules which would stop union members automatically becoming Labour party members. Mr Miliband faced warnings that only around one in 10 union members would opt-in to the party, costing it millions of pounds in funding which it used to receive automatically. In a wide-ranging speech yesterday Mr McCluskey claimed Unite is at a ‘turning point’ in its historic relationship with the Labour party. Speaking to a meeting of Unite activists, he said strains in the link between Labour and the unions have been building up for years, at least since the advent of New Labour in the 1990s. Row: Labour leader Ed Miliband has sought to overhaul the party's links to the unions . ‘Those strains have been fuelled by the failures and disappointments of Labour in office, not least its refusal to seriously address the unique legal impediments trade unions have to work under in Britain. ‘They have been worsened by the feeling that for a long time we have been taken for granted by people who welcome our money, but not our policy input, who want to use our resources at election time but do not want our members as candidates. ‘And all this in an environment when ordinary people in all walks of life have become increasingly disengaged from and disenchanted with politics and politicians.’ Mr McCluskey welcomed changes to the historic arrangements for affiliating union members to Labour which have been put forward by party leader Ed Miliband. A special conference will be held next Spring to agree details of the changes, under which union members would have to agree to opt-in to Labour membership. But he warned the union would stop handing over money without strings attached. He said: ‘Certainly Unite will be using its political fund for a variety of initiatives and not just handing it over to the Labour Party as has generally happened up until now.’ Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said:  'This is proof that Ed Miliband’s proposed changes to Labour’s link with the unions would actually increase Len McCluskey’s control over Labour’s coffers. 'Len McCluskey has said he will use his increased bargaining power to demand Labour adopt the policies he wants. And he will still be able to fix Labour’s candidate selections and pick Labour’s leader. 'So nothing has changed. Ed Miliband would still be too weak to take the difficult decisions needed to cut the deficit or fix welfare. It would be the same old Labour with hardworking people paying the price.' Unite leader Mr McCluskey said many people were saying that the relationship with Labour had to change even before a row flared over union members being signed up for party membership in Falkirk ahead of a selection meeting. However Education Secretary Michael Gove said the proposed opt-in changes could strengthen union influence over the Labour Party . ‘Ed Miliband has made some bold and far-reaching proposals for recasting the trade union relationship with the Labour Party. I know that some pundits were expecting me to reject them outright,’ Mr McCluskey added. ‘To re-run the experience of the last generation on this issue - the party leader says something, the unions reject it and have no positive proposals of their own, the first plan goes through anyway and we look like not just losers, but conservative losers. ‘Well, we all honour our movement's traditions, but this is one tradition overdue for a change. Unite is doing things differently in one area of our work after another, including politics. ‘We need to do things differently here too. We need to engage, rethink and see if we can find better ways to advance our ends.’ However Education Secretary Michael Gove said the proposed opt-in changes could strengthen union influence over the Labour Party. At an event hosted by Populus in central London, he said: ‘It will be the case that fewer are automatically affiliated to the Labour Party as trade union members and that appears to be a diminution in trade union influence. ‘Actually, what it could lead to is the union's exercising more influence because, rather than money flowing automatically, money will go to the Labour Party depending on whether or not the trade union general secretaries, who retain control of their union's political funds, decide that the policies and the candidate selection of the Labour Party are in accordance with their wishes. ‘So, Len McCluskey doesn't lose anything, who doesn't lose any money. What he does gain is control over whether or not that money goes to Labour.’","Union boss warns he will no longer 'hand over' millions to Labour .

A fare-dodging Lithuanian tourist sparked a £1million stand-off and disrupted 40,000 train passengers after he climbed on to a railway station roof, a court heard. Mantas Badauskas, 25, triggered the seven-hour confrontation with police as he tried to dodge a fare in Ipswich, Suffolk, last Friday (July 19). His actions caused massive disruption for commuters and hit thousands of music fans heading to the Latitude festival in nearby Southwold. Mantas Badauskas refused to come down from the roof - even pulling up the ladder that police tried to set up at Ipswich train station . Badauskas was trying to return to Lithuania after a week in England but had lost all his belongings, Ipswich magistrates heard. The tourist tried to use an Oyster Card, a London travel pass, at Ipswich train station, believing the town was part of the capital. But when station staff told him he must pay for his ticket to Stansted Airport, in Essex, he tried to clamber over a roof in a bid to bypass the ticket barriers. Badauskas then set off a chain of events which led to the rail lines being shut down and scores of services cancelled. The incident, which began at just after 8am last Friday, led to 79 trains to be delayed or cancelled. About 750 furious passengers were trapped in three trains without power or air conditioning while they waited for the tourist to climb down . Tess Mann, prosecuting, said that Badauskas was seen on the canopy above Platform One, which was packed with passengers waiting for trains. Police were called but he warned cops that he'd jump if they went near him. Bare-chested Badauskas stayed up on the roof for nearly seven hours in the hot sun, repeatedly refusing all requests to get down. Mrs Mann said that a ladder was put up at 9.15am for him to go down but he pulled it up on to the roof as police, firefighters and paramedics went to the scene. Police feared that the glass and asbestos canopy was not strong enough to support Badauskas' weight. The tourist was also close to 25,000 volt power cables, which had to be switched off. Badauskas hurled bolts at police negotiators, but was finally brought down at around 3.10pm . About 750 furious passengers were trapped in three trains without power or air conditioning on a baking hot day as a result, the court heard. Badauskas hurled bolts at police negotiators, but brought the drawn-out incident to an end when he got down at 3.10pm. He was taken to hospital to be treated for the effects of dehydration. Mrs Mann said Greater Anglia reckoned 40,000 passengers were stranded at stations during the face-off. Badauskas told police he just wanted to reach Stansted Airport to fly home to Lithuania. The tourist is now set to be sentenced at Ipswich Crown Court after he admitted obstruction without intent . Mrs Mann said: 'He thought he could get the train to Stansted by going on the canopy. 'When he realised he couldn't, the police had already seen him. 'He was frightened to go back down because he was scared of being arrested.' The cost of the face-off - in terms of lost production and compensation claims to rail operator Greater Anglia - is estimated to have topped £1 million. Badauskas is now set to be sentenced at Ipswich Crown Court after he admitted obstruction without intent. Badauskas could be jailed for up to two years. Magistrates committed the case to crown court and remanded him in custody.

Fraudster: NHS worker Fiona Gillen, pictured outside Dundee Sheriff Court yesterday, was sentenced to 150 hours unpaid community work . An NHS worker who lied about the death of her father in order to claim paid leave was yesterday spared a jail sentence for fraud. Fiona Gillen, 45, told her bosses he had passed away and she needed time off to attend his funeral in England. But it later emerged he was alive and knew nothing of the scam. At Dundee Sheriff Court, Gillen pleaded guilty to two charges of obtaining money by fraud from NHS Tayside between March 9, 2011 and April 22, 2011. Yesterday, Sheriff George Way told Gillen, of Alyth, Perthshire, that she had ‘breached trust’ – but would not go to jail over the fraud. He said: ‘She’s a first offender and has lost a great deal through all  of this. ‘The sums of money at stake make it clear that for a first offender there would have to be more involved for a custodial sentence. ‘Taking into account the fact there was a breach of trust – she was expected by her employers to tell the truth – I will impose a community payback order with 150 hours unpaid work.’ Gillen had worked as an administrator at the Scottish Bowel Screening Centre at Dundee’s Kings Cross Hospital. In March 2011, she went to her supervisor Linda Brownlee and told her that her father Patrick had died and she needed time off to attend the funeral in Ipswich, Suffolk. Taking advantage of sympathetic colleagues, she then spun out several more weeks of paid leave. Following the invented burial service, Gillen told her boss she was suffering from stress as a result of her father’s death. She even managed to produce medical certificates from her doctor, who diagnosed ‘bereavement reaction’, to support her story. Gillen kept the scam up for  more than a month before she was found out. A source said: ‘Eventually, red flags were raised and an investigation was launched. There was no record of a Patrick Gillen dying in the Ipswich area, as she had claimed. Lies: Ms Gillen told bosses at Dundee's King Cross Hospital, pictured, that she needed time off to attend her father's funeral despite the fact he was very much alive and well . ‘An investigator managed to track him down and he said he hadn’t seen Fiona for over 18 months before this all happened.’ Gillen was later dismissed from her job and now works as a housekeeper. The court heard she ‘knew her father’s death was fictitious’ and had invented the tale to get NHS Tayside to pay her despite her not being at work. Mr Gillen, of Felixstowe in Suffolk, said after a previous court appearance: ‘We are a little estranged from our daughter. She lives her own life, like a lot of children these days. We still love our daughter and would like her to get in touch with us. We have no way of getting in touch with her. ‘We are just very sad about it all. We are sad about the state she seems to have got herself into.’Earlier this year, a social worker who lied about six of her relatives dying within two years in order to get paid leave was struck off. Rachael Miles claimed that her father, mother, aunt, uncle, brother and ex-husband had all died, thus obtaining 66 days paid leave from Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council. A Health and Care Professions Council hearing found that she had provided ‘misleading information’ for a number of absences and retained payments for compassionate leave. Panel chairman Alexander Yule said she had shown ‘little remorse’ and that her fraud was particularly damaging as she should have been helping ‘vulnerable individuals’.","Fiona Gillen, 45, told her bosses at the Scottish Bowel Screening Centre at Dundee’s Kings Cross Hospital she needed time off to attend father's funeral .

A town in Germany took the controversial step of employing asylum seekers to carry passengers' luggage during renovation work at the train station. They were paid €1.05 an hour to act as porters at the station in the town of Schwäbisch Gmünd. The ten refugees, originally from African countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan, currently reside in the 250-strong refugee shelter in the town. Helping hand: The group of 10 asylum seekers were paid just over a euro per hour to help rail passengers carry their luggage over a temporary bridge at the German station . Strengthening community: The refugees, from Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, wore red t-shirts with the word 'service' printed on . All were volunteers for the jobs and no benefits were dependent upon them working. Clad in red T-shirts declaring 'Service' - together with straw hats to shield them from the sun - the refugees worked in teams of two, completing two luggage-hauling shifts a day between 6.15am and 6pm. Porters: The meagre sum is the most asylum seekers can earn in Germany by law . The town - which is getting a face-lift as it prepares to host the state of  Baden-Wüttermberg's State Garden Festival next year - employed the refugees after receiving complaints from passengers unwilling or unable to carry their own luggage over a temporary steel bridge between platforms during renovation work. The meagre wage – paid on top of free transport to and from work - is the maximum asylum seekers can earn in Germany by law. 'It's not a sum that serves as an incentive,' said town spokesman Markus Hermann. 'Everyone wishes they could be paid more.' The scheme in the German town was praised by the mayor Richard Arnold . One way is to appeal to passengers – who have welcomed the new porters - to give them generous tips to supplement their earnings, said Hermann. Schwäbisch Gmünd Mayor Richard Arnold is keen to get the refugees involved in the community – and sees the station work as just one way to encourage contact between locals and the asylum seekers. 'These people are living with us and we have to take care of them,' Mayor Arnold said of the porters, who are seen in pictures provided by Gmuender Tagespost.","Group of ten live in refugee shelter in town of Schwäbisch Gmünd .

A furious mother is suing a nursery after her three-year-old daughter's thumb was ripped off when she got it trapped in a door. Kacie Lumsden got her fingers wedged between a door and a wall while playing at a day nursery. The tip of her right thumb was ripped off in the incident before frantic staff packed it in ice and surgeons were able to reattach it. Kacie's distraught family are now suing Glengarry Children's Daycare Nursery in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, after bosses admitted liability for the child's injuries. After the incident, which happened in November last year, Kacie was rushed to New Cross Wolverhampton Hospital before being transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital where surgeons managed to reattach the tip of her thumb. An Ofsted investigation has severely criticised the nursery and re-adjusted it's rating to 'inadequate'. As a result, it lost funding from Wolverhampton City Council and closed on June 28 with the company in administration. Kacie's mother Tanya James, 30, said the traumatic experience had transformed her daughter from a confident girl to a shy, withdrawn child. The mother-of-three, who is herself a qualified nursery nurse, said: 'Kacie is now completely different. 'She clings to me all the time and is very nervous when I am not around.

Criticism: Business Secretary Vince Cable took aim at the Bank of England for curbing lending to businesses . Furious Vince Cable has accused the Bank of England of behaving like the ‘Taliban’ in imposing strict lending rules which have held back the economy. The Business Secretary said tough restrictions imposed on banks to build up stock piles of money was choking off lending to small firms. In a further escalation of the row between the government and the Bank of England, a Treasury source slammed the ‘jihadist’ tendency in Threadneedle Street towards the banks. Mr Cable’s outspoken intervention comes ahead of figures tomorrow which are expected to show a sharp return to economic growth by up to 0.6 per cent for the last quarter. But the minister suggested the recovery could have come sooner if the Bank of England had encouraged more lending to businesses to help them expand and hire more staff. Mr Cable said: ‘One of the anxieties in the business community is that the so called “capital Taliban” in the Bank of England are imposing restrictions which at this delicate stage of recovery actually make it more difficult for companies to operate and expand. ‘It is clear that the main banks are failing to support good British companies in key areas like exporting and innovation,’ he told the Financial Times. Mr Cable has expressed similar views before, but the strong language of his latest intervention comes less than a month into the tenure of new Bank governor Mark Carney. It remains to be seen whether his remarks will persuade policymakers to soften their stance or simply harden their resolve. Chancellor George Osborne was reported to share Mr Cable's views. One Treasury official told the FT that it was hoped that Mr Carney would rein in the ‘jihadist’ tendency of the Bank of England in imposing tough rules on lenders. The Bank's new Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has ordered Britain's five biggest lenders to raise £13.4 billion to plug a £27.1 billion gap in their finances. Tensions: The public attack will heap pressure on new Bank of England governor Mark Carney to shift policy . Nationwide, Britain's biggest building society, was reportedly left with a £1 billion hole. Two weeks ago it announced that it had been able to meet the PRA's demand for it to strengthen its leverage ratio - a key measure of financial strength - to 3 per cent from 2 per cent, without raising extra funds from investors. The fear is that in order to meet the new targets, banks and building societies will cut back on lending to households and small businesses. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘I think Vince Cable is quoting other people, rather than trying to use the word himself. ‘But there clearly is concern in various parts of the industry about the pace at which they're required to raise their capital ratios. ‘The trouble at the moment - and indeed for the last five years - is that we've had this massive increase in capital amongst banks of £165 billion during a time of low economic growth. ‘Across the banking sector as a whole, there clearly is a correlation in the short term between requiring banks to massively upgrade the amount of capital they have and the amount of lending and the amount of economic growth.’","Business Secretary warns bank restrictions are holding back the recovery .

Stefanie Janikiewicz (pictured outside court) was nearly three times the drink drive limit when she drove for around seven miles at a snails pace along the M55 . A teacher who drove the wrong way up a motorway after a wine and cocktails drinking session was freed by a judge today. Stefanie Janikiewicz, 25, was nearly three times the drink drive limit when she drove for around seven miles at a snails pace along the M55 towards Blackpool, Lancashire. When she was eventually stopped after seven calls to police from other motorists Janikiewicz stunned officers by admitting she thought she was on her way to Liverpool, around 55 miles away in the other direction, to speak to an ex-boyfriend. She travelled for much of her 38 minute journey along the hard shoulder 'at walking pace' and she had so much to drink that she could not remember what she had done. Janikiewicz, from Thurstaston, Wirral, admitted dangerous driving and drink driving at Preston Crown Court and could have faced up to two years in jail. She was given a six month sentence suspended for 18 months and was banned from the road for two years. She was also ordered to pay £350 costs. Judge Anthony Russell QC said she could go free because of her previous good character and the fact she was an 'impeccable person and popular teacher'. After the case Carole Whittingham, of the Campaign Against Drink Driving said: 'The judge's ruling is an abysmal decision and as far as I am concerned sends out totally the wrong message. I would call for a minimum five year ban and a jail sentence. 'A short suspended sentence shows the courts do not take drink driving seriously enough. It is so disappointing. Driving on the wrong side of the road can have catastrophic consequences. 'This woman is a teacher and is a role model to young people. What sort of message does the sentence send to those pupils?' Earlier Susan Carter, prosecuting, said the alert was raised on May 12 at midnight after police received seven telephone calls saying Janikiewicz was travelling in her Nissan Micra along the M55 heading towards Blackpool on the wrong side of the carriageway. She added: 'An officer was deployed and it transpired that the vehicle was first seen in the vicinity of Junction 30 of the M6 at 11:37pm, seven miles from where eventually she was stopped. 'A PC Braithwaite travelled in the third lane and saw the defendant travelling towards him at walking pace, the vehicle was stopped and the defendant appeared dazed and confused and smelt strongly of intoxicants. 'She provided a positive breath test at the roadside of 97mg in 100 ml of breath. The limit is 35mg. In interview she could give little explanation as to how she came to be travelling on the wrong side for such a long period.' She said that earlier in the day Janikiewicz had travelled from London to Manchester and had been drinking on the train. She had then gone for a meal in Didsbury, Greater Manchester, and drunk more alcohol before setting off in her car. Mrs Carter said: 'Liverpool is a journey which she says she had taken many times because her boyfriend lived there. There was no accident but the aggravating features are the length of time travelling in the wrong direction, she was on the road from 30 odd minutes, and the level of drink consumed.' Janikiewicz admitted dangerous driving and drink driving at Preston Crown Court (pictured). She was given a six month sentence suspended for 18 months and was banned from the road for two years . In mitigation the court heard Janikiewicz works for charity Teach First, which trains graduates to become inspirational teachers working in areas of deprivation. She was working with several schools in Greater Manchester, mainly in Bolton, alongside staff teachers to raise aspirations of pupils as well as their grades. Defence lawyer Virginia Hayton said: 'On that morning she had absolutely no intention of driving that day. She had travelled back on the train to Manchester, she lives in Didsbury. 'It is a miracle there was no accident or . even a near miss. It could have had terrible consequences not only for . others but also yourself' - Judge Anthony Russell QC . 'She had a couple of drinks on the train but had no intention of driving, she then went for a meal with her sister. Following an argument, she had little recollection of anything after that, whatever possessed her to get in her car she doesn't know. 'She is genuinely remorseful and grateful for the court allowing her to graduate. She is clearly an excellent student with Teach First. She hopes to return. She is clearly an asset to the education system and parents say she has turned their children's behaviour around. She is a popular teacher. 'She is aware that there is a custodial risk. She can see that it is such a serious offence which clearly crosses the custodial threshold. I ask you to suspend any custodial sentence. 'There was no excessive speed, she travelled little over seven miles the wrong way but it had taken her 38 minutes to do so. She has no recollection of the travelling. 'She must have travelling extremely slowly because it has taken her so long. There was no accident, she must have been crawling along the hard shoulder, it is an unlit road. 'One can only assume she was on the hard shoulder. Thankfully there was no accident and no one has been hurt, she could have killed others and herself. 'The impact of an immediate custodial sentence would be highly catastrophic. She has not touched alcohol since the offence.' Sentencing, Judge Anthony Russell QC, told the teacher: 'It is clear that you were driving for some considerable distance while completely unfit to do so. 'It is a miracle there was no accident or even a near miss. It could have had terrible consequences not only for others but also yourself. 'It was a serious case of dangerous driving. The other side of the coin is that you are an impeccable person and have become a popular teacher. It is clear you have a great deal of support and it is very much to your credit that you recognise the problems you have and have been addressing that. 'This case clearly crosses the custodial threshold but I have come to the conclusion to suspend because of your good character.'","Stefanie Janikiewicz was stopped as she drove the wrong way up the M55 .

She faced contempt of court charges and a possible prison sentence for failing to hand them over. Ms Jones, 47, disappeared with her children last October on the day she was due to send them back to their army officer father in Spain. They were all found safe and well 30 hours later 60 miles from Miss Jones' home in Llanelli, south Wales, after a High Court judge made a public appeal for help. Tug-of-love: Jennifer Jones, 47, went on the run with four of her five children after they refused to return to their father in Spain . Miss Jones' ex-husband Tomas Palacin Cambra was granted custody of their children after the break-up of their 12-year marriage in 2008. At a hearing in the High Court in London, the judge ruled that Miss Jones was not in contempt of court for failing to return her children immediately. Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division of the High Court, said that she didn't wilfully breach the order. Miss Jones' lawyers said she was unable to return her children as two of them had run away to a local police station after saying they did not want to leave their mother. Last summer the couple's four youngest children - Jessica, 14, Tomas, 12, Eva, 10, and David, eight - were staying with their mother in Wales. The mother also has a fifth child called Sara, 17, who stayed with her father in Majorca.

They are (left to right) Tomas, Sara (who was not missing), Eva, Jessica and David . But when it was time to send them back to Spain, Miss Jones put them into schools in her home town of Llanelli while she started custody proceedings. The English teacher then went missing after the High Court ruled they should be returned to their father following an application from a Spanish court using child abduction laws under The Hague Convention. Yesterday lawyers for the Solicitor General argued at the High Court that Miss Jones was in contempt for not upholding the order and returning her children. Her lawyers told Sir Munby that her contempt was not 'deliberate'. Court fight: Jennifer Jones went on the run with four of her five . children during a bitter custody battle.

On the day she was due to hand the children over to her ex-husband two of them were so 'traumatised' that they ran to a local police station in Llanelli, Miss Jones told the court. Children's father: Spanish army officer Tomas Palacin Cambra . Her lawyers said her children's behaviour made it impossible to comply with the order. Miss Jones said: 'I was very worried about everything. 'Those children didn't want to go back [to Spain]. It was pretty clear. All I knew was that my daughter and my son had run away and escaped. 'I was very concerned about my children. I was so frightened because I knew I was supposed to be in Cardiff. I was going through a lot of emotions. 'As a mother you go by your instincts.' Sir James upheld these claims and dismissed the contempt of court case against her today. After the mother and children had been found, English language teacher Miss Jones and her boyfriend John Williams, 48, a builder, were arrested and the children put in the custody of foster carers. Colonel Cambra, 53, a Spanish army officer, flew from Majorca to the UK with their eldest daughter, Sara, 17, to collect all of the children. They returned home with only Eva, ten, and David, eight, while Jessica, 15, and Tomas, 13, remained with their mother until the court decided their future. Family: The five children when they were younger. Pictured are (back) Jessica and Sara, (front) Tomas, Eva and David . During the hearing Miss Jones revealed letters by the children begging the judge not to be sent back to Spain with their father.

Miss Jones met Colonel Cambra when he . was a captain while she was teaching English in Tenerife. They were . married in 1996 and lived in the Canary Islands and Ibiza but . frequently returned to Wales to stay with Miss Jones’s family.

"By . Jenny Hope . UPDATED: . 19:07 EST, 2 February 2012 . Sex infections are soaring among the over-45s because rising divorce rates mean more older people are having unprotected sex. Cases of chlamydia and herpes have more than doubled in ten years, while syphilis – which was almost eradicated ten years ago – have risen fourfold. Researchers say one in five adults receiving HIV treatment is at least 50 – twice as many in that age bracket as a decade ago, with a particular surge in the number of pensioners being diagnosed. Sex infections are soaring among the over-45s because rising divorce rates mean more older people are having unprotected sex . They claim men who take Viagra are especially vulnerable to HIV. The warnings come from doctors writing in the magazine Student BMJ, who say four out of five people aged 50-90 are sexually active. Public health officials have grown increasingly concerned about the spread of sex infections among older people. Doctors blame increasing separations among the age group and the subsequent search for new relationships, often through internet dating agencies. But many fail to heed safe-sex messages to use condoms, believing they are aimed only at younger people. Doctors say they are seeing increasing rates of HIV (pictured) and STI infection in older people . A survey last year found one in ten Britons aged over 50 was happy to have a fling on holiday. Research has also suggested older ‘swingers’ are pushing up rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with some of the highest rates among heterosexual couples who swap partners at organised parties and indulge in group sex. Dr Valerie Delpech, head of the HIV department at the Health Protection Agency, said: ‘We are seeing increasing rates of HIV and STI infection in older people, perhaps in those coming out of long-term relationships and entering into new partnerships. This is a reminder that we can all be at risk of an STI, including HIV, and anyone considering having sex with someone new should have a sexual health screen and use a condom, no matter what age they are.’ Rachel von Stimson, medical student at King’s College London, and Ranjababu Kulasegaram, consultant genito-urinary physician at St Thomas’ Hospital, London, found an increase in cases of all STIs in Britain, the U.S. and Canada among those aged 45 to 64 in the last ten years. Official figures for England from the HPA show the biggest rise of 337 per cent among over-45s with syphilis, up from 98 cases in 2001 to 428 cases in 2010. Cases of chlamydia, the UK’s most common STI, rose from 1,184 to 2,812 – a jump of 138 per cent. Men who have been prescribed impotence drugs such as Viagra (pictured) are significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a sex infection in the first year of usage . New cases of genital herpes rose 142 per cent from 1,349 to 3,259, while first episodes of genital warts went up 62 per cent from 2,905 to 4,708. There was a 14 per cent rise in gonorrhoea from 1,090 cases to 1,242. Older women may be more at risk, say the researchers, because physical changes after the menopause leave them more prone to infection. Men who have been prescribed impotence drugs such as Viagra are significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a sex infection in the first year of usage. The researchers want GPs to take more responsibility for discussing safe sex with older patients. Natika Halil, of the FPA – formerly the Family Planning Association, said: ‘Too many people in that age group coming out of long-term relationships don’t think safer sex applies to them. ‘But the truth is STIs will find you just as attractive whatever your age.’","Cases of chlamydia and herpes doubled in 10 years .

Controversial plans for a second runway at Gatwick costing up to £9billion flew into immediate turbulence from residents and environmental groups after airport bosses unveiled their blueprint today. They said a new runway in West Sussex, positioned to the south of the current site, could be open in 2025 and could almost treble passenger numbers but be less expensive and less noisy than an extra runway at Heathrow. It comes after rivals Heathrow and Stansted both submitted plans to expand to up to four runways. The Gatwick chiefs said an additional runway would bring potential investment benefits to Britain of around £56billion over the period to 2050, would create up to 19,000 jobs and support wider economic and social regeneration. Gatwick unveiled plans for a second runway (left) to the south of Gatwick Airport . The new runway could be open by 2025 and could treble passenger numbers at the airport . Also, a two-runway Gatwick would not breach European and national air quality standards and is backed by key local authorities and business groups. The Gatwick plans will be submitted to the Government-appointed Airports Commission headed by former Financial Services Authority chief Sir Howard Davies. The commission is due to make its final report on airport capacity in summer 2015. Last week London Mayor Boris Johnson was at the at the centre of a Nazi jibe row after one of Britain's to architects branded his plans for a Thames Estuary airport on a par with the grandiose projects that Adolf Hitler might have dreamed up. Sir Terry Farrell, who is working on Gatwick's bid to build a second runway and  who designed the distinctive MI6 spy headquarters which features in many recent James Bond movies, said the London Mayor's  plan to build a £65billion airport on the Thames Estuary  was 'mad' and comparable to the sort of project that Adolf Hitler might have dreamed up. Sir Terry told London's Evening Standard newspaper: 'When people say that you have got to have vision, well Hitler had vision. 'Vision can be a madness where you get so obsessed you throw everything you have got on the roulette table and hope you got it right.' Hitler famously used his personal architect and armaments minister Albert Speer to draw up plans on an epic scale  for a radically re-designed Berlin – to be renamed 'Germania' after a German victory. Sir Terry, who has also  designed some of the world's largest airports and railway stations, said the scale of the proposed four-runway project would be unprecedented in Britain and made the Government's HS2 high-speed rail project 'look like chicken feed'. The airport dog-fight came after the Mayor underlined his commitment to an estuary airport by naming Sir Norman Foster's £65billion Isle of Grain plan as his first choice. The Mayor also wants to shut Heathrow at a cost of £15 billion and create a new London borough for 250,000 residents. Sir Terry's comments escalated the tension between Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick as they all this week go public with their rival plans. Sir Terry said closing Heathrow and moving the predominant London airport to the eastern extreme would mean 'flipping London', adding: 'In that case people say you could make Heathrow a new town. It makes HS2 look like chicken feed. It's going to be the biggest project the UK has ever done in its history.' But expansion is vigorously opposed by . the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign (GACC) protest group and the . local Green Party MEP who said it would blight homes and mean 'more . noise, more pollution and more congestion nearby.' Under a legal agreement made in 1979 the West Sussex airport cannot build a second runway before 2019 – and Gatwick' insists it will honour that agreement. But this runs out in just six years' time. Gatwick put forward three main options for how a southern parallel runway would operate costing between £5billion and £9billion. The airport bosses said none of the options presented significant project complexity or risk and all could open to passengers by 2025. Depending on which option is chosen, the airport's capacity would increase from the current figure of 34.2 million passengers a year to between 67 million and 87 million by the 2040s. Gatwick said the land required for the construction of a second runway had been formally safeguarded since 2003. It is estimated that the potential number of properties lost for the runway options range between 50 and 100 homes at Gatwick, as against 950 to 2,700 at Heathrow if a third, extra, runway is built there. Also, . the Gatwick executives said road and rail access requirements are . significantly less than the needs of Heathrow or for the plans for a . brand new airport to the east of London favoured by London Mayor Boris Johnson. Gatwick chief executive Stewart . Wingate said: 'London is the best -connected city in the world today . because the UK's aviation industry is one of the most competitive and . innovative. 'Our proposal to . the Airports Commission builds on this foundation and would ensure that . the UK has an airports policy which offers the additional capacity that . Britain needs, improves the resilience of the airports system and, . above all, can be delivered.' He . added:'Our evidence shows clearly that an additional runway at Gatwick . would best serve the needs of all passengers, and give certainty to . airlines, communities and businesses. It would deliver the connectivity . the UK needs with lower environmental impacts, whilst spreading the . economic benefits. Option 1: Dependent Segregated Mode: Runways spaced closely together - with a separation less than 760m - are too close to operate independently to each other. They are dependent on one another. So the operations on one runway would temporarily interrupt the operations on the other. One runway would be used for aircraft arrivals and one for departures - a method of operation called ¿segregated mode¿. This method of operation could support around 67 to 70 ¿movements¿ (landings and/or take-offs) per hour, which could equate to an overall two runway capacity of some 60 to 66 million passengers per year by 2050. Option 2: Independent Segregated Mode: If the runways are positioned 760m or more apart the runways can be operated independently of each other. This means that arrivals on one runway do not affect departures on the other. Capacity could increase to around 75 landings and take-offs per hour equating to some 75-82 million passengers per year by 2050. Option 3: Independent Mixed Mode: If the runways are at least 1,035m apart, it can then be possible to operate them in ¿independent mixed mode¿. Each runway could accommodate both arriving and departing aircraft. In this way flexibility and capacity would be maximised. Capacity could amount to between 95 and 100 take-off and landings per hour or more and would equate to some 80 to 87 million passengers per year by 2050. 'A . two-runway Gatwick, as part of a constellation of three major airports . surrounding London, will also provide flexibility in an industry where . the only constant is change.' Earlier, Mr Wingate told the BBC Radio . 4 Today programme: 'I think there are a number of airlines in this . debate with a number of different positions. Certainly some of the . Heathrow airlines, as you would expect, support Heathrow, whereas the . airlines here at Gatwick are very supportive of the second runway being . built.' Mr Wingate admitted that Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, who represents the nearby constituency of Horsham, has 'reservations' about the plans. He added: 'We have certainly briefed Francis on the plans that we have. I think it is fair to say that Francis has some reservations about the second runway project at Gatwick but is very supportive of the work that we are doing and will see the detail that we layout today and hopefully that will help to convince Francis that this is the right solution.' But Keith Taylor, the Green Party MEP for the South East, attacked the proposals for the expansion of Gatwick airport. He said: 'It's no surprise that the bosses of Gatwick want to build this second runway. They are hell-bent on bringing more flights into the UK's airspace and they seem more than happy to gloss over the grave environmental and health implications of airport expansion.' Mr Taylor said: 'The residents around Gatwick, who already have their lives blighted by the airport's noise, will be greatly concerned about the prospect of another runway being built on their doorstep. I'll be joining residents in fighting against the proposal for another runway which would mean more noise, more pollution and more congestion nearby.' Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign (GACC) protest group has suggested that airport bosses were announcing a second runway now to drive up the company's value and share price in advance of a sell-off by some key investors: 'It's like getting planning permission for a house extension before you sell it. And they've made no secret they want to sell by 2018,' said a spokesman.","Runway could be built to the south of the airport and is being planned to rival Heathrow and Stansted expansion plans .

An unemployed husband accused of shooting his 34-year-old orthodontist wife to death in April and leaving their two-year-old daughter with the body has been allowed to live in the home where the brutal murder occurred. A Williamson County judge ruled yesterday that Randolph Maidens, 42, from Brentwood, Tennessee, can return to the Governors Club family home he shared with his wife and daughter until April 21, when Dr Rachael Maidens was found dead. A restraining order on money the couple jointly held is still in place and his passport has been revoked. Murdered: Randolph Maidens allegedly killed his wife Rachael Maidens in their gated community home . Scene: He later emerged from trees at the back of their plush home in Brentwood, Tennessee . Court Hearing: Randolph Maidens appears in court in May during a preliminary hearing in his trial for murdering his wife, Dr Rachael Maidens . Dr Rachael Maidens' body was found wrapped in a blanket with multiple gunshot wounds on April 21 by police. A note 'expressing regret for what happened' and asking for custody of the child to go to Dr Maiden's mother was on the kitchen . counter, the shotgun by the couch and the car trunk stuffed with $87,200. His young daughter told responding officers when they came to the home to perform a welfare check: 'Daddy gone.' The two-year-old was not injured. A manhunt was launched for the former pharmaceuticals representative and the community was put on lockdown but he walked into the home the next morning with his hands in the air and surrendered. Rachael Maidens’ mother, Elizabeth . Frisbie, brought a civil action against her former son-in-law that . included time to conduct an inventory of the house’s contents, joint . bank accounts and other personal property held by the couple. Maidens has pleaded not guilty to all . charges, including homicide, a charge of child abuse/neglect for . leaving his child alone while he fled and two counts of tampering with . evidence. Court Date: Randolph Maidens is charged with shooting his orthodontist wife dead on April 21st with a shotgun in their Tennessee home . Arrest: Maidens fled the home after allegedly killing his wife and leaving their daughter, 2, with her body . Together: Police have not revealed a motive and friends and neighbors said the family had seemed happy together . At the time of Rachael's death, one neighbor described how she witnessed Maidens acting bizarrely three weeks before the shooting. 'I saw him running through the woods behind our house, and he a had on a black ski . mask and a backpack that looked like a quiver,' the neighbor told WKRN-TV. 'It was daytime . and he was running through the woods... and down to the ravine, right past our house, and I followed him . and he laid down in the ravine and pulled off the ski mask.' When she asked him what he was doing, 'He made some . kind of statement that made no sense' before adding, 'Well, I was walking my dogs, I got lost', she said. Hunt: Police deployed helicopters and K-9 units to search for Maidens after the body of his wife was found but he surrendered the next day . Ripped apart: Maidens is out on bond and is free to live in the marital home he shared with his wife . Rachael Maidens owned an orthodontist practice, RM Orthodontics, in Maryland Farms. 'I think to say just how sorry I am and I'm going to miss coming to the office and seeing her,' former patient Cindy Bayer told News Channel 5. 'She always had a smile and was always friendly.

A 17-year-old suspected of killing six-year-old girl who was found dead under a tarp in the street has been shot in the head after opening fire on officers serving his arrest warrant. One officer was hit in the groin when Tyler Holder allegedly pulled out a gun from his waistband and opened fire outside his home in Saginaw, Texas on Tuesday morning. Another officer then shot Holder, who was struck in the head. He was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth and his injuries are life-threatening, officials said. Holder is wanted in connection with the . death of six-year-old Alanna Gallagher, who vanished as she played . outside her home on July 1. Her partially-naked body was found hours later under a tarp. Suspect: Tyler Holder, 17, has been shot in the head after opening fire on an officer who was serving his arrest warrant. He is suspected of killing six-year-old Alanna Gallagher (right) who was found dead July 1 . Authorities have not named Holder, but he was identified by local media, including NBC-DFW. Officers were serving Holder - who . lives just two homes from the Gallagher family - with the warrant after . DNA evidence linked him to the dead child, NBC reported. Until this morning's dramatic turn of events, it was not known that police had identified a suspect. They have been appealing for the public's help in gathering information in recent weeks. The teenager lives with his mother at . the home on Babbling Brook Drive but was alone when five or more . officers arrived at his home. Scene: Five officers arrived at the home in Saginaw, Texas and watched as Holder pulled out a gun from his wasitband. He shot one officer, hitting him in the groin, before he was shot in the head . Heartbreaking: The arrest comes after Alanna's body was found tied and partially naked with a bag over her head under this tarp in the street. A 14-year-old boy came across her body . He . came to the front door with a gun in his waistband, pulled it out and . opened fire at the officers, a law enforcement source told NBC. The injured officer, who has not been . identified, remains in critical condition. He was part of the Arlington . Police Department on assignment with the FBI task force investigating . the murder. 'We ask that everyone has prayers for the officer at this time,' Saginaw Officer Damon Ing said. Ing said the teenager, a student at North Hills Private School in Irving, is the main suspect in little Alanna's murder. She lived there with her siblings, . their parents Laura and Karl Gallagher, and a second male, Miles . McDaniel, who was in a polyamorous relationship with her parents. Wanted: Holder, shown in pictures from Facebook, lives just two houses from the Gallagher family . Police . have said that the Gallaghers and McDaniel were home while Alanna . played outside alone. They are not sure when she was abducted from the . neighborhood. The girl's body was found about 7.30pmby 14-year-old Owen . Whiddon, who was riding his scooter through his neighborhood in Saginaw - . about a mile and a half from where the girl lived. She was found tied up, half-naked and with a bag over her head. Her father did not report her missing for another two hours after she was found. Since her death, her family said they . have continued to be targeted. Last week, a memorial set up for the . little girl outside her home was set on fire along with the family's . sedan. 'It has been the worst month of my life,' Alanna's mother, Laura, told reporters afterwards. 'The three of us': A Facebook image shows Alanna's parents, Laura . and Karl (left) Gallagher with Miles McDaniel (right), who are in a . polyamorous relationship . 'Father and daughter': Miles McDaniel, pictured, is named on Alanna's obituary as one of her parents . Neighbors said the inquisitive girl with 'curly brown hair and a constant . smile' loved to play alone outside in her front yard - but was cautious . to always tell strangers they had to keep away. 'She seemed smarter . than the average (child her age), just because of the questions she’d . always ask,' neighbor John Janus told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. 'And . her parents are nice and very, very smart people. They like books. The . last time I was in their home, the front room looked like a library.' Last . week, investigators probing her death seized more than 100 items from . the family's home and cars, but said none of the three parents are prime . suspects. Unthinkable: Laura Gallagher stands over charred remnants of her car after it was set on fire last week . Coping: Neighbors set up a makeshift . memorial on the curb but it was torched along with the . family's car . Saginaw Police Chief Roger Macon added that officers were not judging the parents' polyamorous relationship. 'The Gallagher/McDaniel family considers Miles as a parent, and we are being considerate of their lifestyle; it's not our place to offer judgment on them,' Macon said. 'As with any criminal investigation, each of the people closest to the victim is being considered, and their actions investigated.'","Tyler Holder, 17, wanted in connection with the death of Alanna Gallagher .

The date and time of the new royal baby's birth indicate that he will be highly intuitive and kind by nature, according to a top psychic. Fourth-generation psychic medium Linda Lauren, who is based in New Jersey, observed the date and time of the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's new son to assess the colours and energy around him. She told MailOnline: 'Being born on July 22nd astrologically puts the new baby on the cusp of . his birth sign (like his father the month prior, June 21) of emotionally . sensitive sign of Cancer and the willful and sensitive sign of Leo. Sharing signs: The Royal baby is a Cancerian like Prince William, pictured left, with a moon in Capricorn - the same star-sign as mother Kate, pictured right . 'His energy is that of someone who will be highly intuitive and kind by . nature due to his birth during a full moon cycle.' The psychic's observation that the blue and green energy around the future king indicate prosperity comes as little surprise, however she did note that the colours mean that the infant can expect good health and a way with words. 'He will probably talk early,' she said. The infant's sensitive nature will have a strong guiding hand in his mother, she says - but may experience friction with his father over emotional issues. 'Being born on July 22nd puts the new baby on the cusp of emotionally . sensitive Cancer and willful and sensitive Leo' 'This family will be led by the strong, orderly person in Catherine as a grounded Capricorn,' she says. 'The energy they share as a family is very blue and purple which tells me that Prince William will bump heads with his son on issues of emotion but they will always reason it out. Overall colour: yellow, a very easy, happy vibe.' William and Catherine welcomed their new son at 4.24pm this afternoon at St Mary's Hospital in London. The baby's star sign, Cancer, is one shared by his father and late grandmother Diana, Princess of Wales. Happy news: The official notice at Buckingham Palace announcing the birth of the royal baby at 4.24pm. It means he is a Cancer, but had he been born half an hour later, he would have been a Leo . Had he been born after 4.54 today, the . child would have been a Leo, like its great aunt Princess Margaret, . Countess of Snowdon, and Princess Anne. The Duchess of Cambridge went into . labour at 5.30am this morning - with many suggesting the  approaching . full moon at 11.16am helped bring on the contractions. Reading energy: Fourth-generation psychic medium Linda Lauren, is based in New Jersey . Prince . William was by his wife's side at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary’s . Hospital in Paddington, west London, where he himself was born in 1982. Traditionally . those born under the sign of Cancer arrive between June 22nd and July . 22nd although the exact dates vary slightly every year. Famous . Cancerians include former South African president Nelson Mandela, . Hollywood actors Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise, and Edward . VIII, who gave up the throne for American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Astrologer Patrick Arundell said the . future king or queen will be more conventional because it is a . Cancerian, but would have been more of a ground-breaker if he was born . tomorrow as a Leo. 'Mars . and Jupiter are conjunct in Cancer and that will give the baby a . tremendous amount of go-get energy and that is already in motion,' he . said. He added: 'Venus and the Sun are also . in a magnetic connection which will give the baby a star quality and a . sparkling charisma.' Meanwhile . there have been numerous theories as to what caused the Duchess of . Cambridge to go into labour - whether it was the full moon, an electrical . storm or just conventional 'Baby Mean Time'. Maternity wards are said to be busier . during a full moon, although there is debate in the medical world about . whether the moon does encourage women to go into labour. Written in the stars: The new baby shares a sign with his late grandmother, Diana, Princess of . Wales, pictured (left) in 1985. Had he been a Leo, he would have shared a sign with Princess Margaret, pictured in 1960 . Mervi Jokinen, of the Royal College of Midwives, said midwives often talk of how the full moon makes for a busy spate of deliveries. 'It's always sort of been an old . wives tale saying that the full moon brings women into labour. Midwives . usually do say ""I'm on call. It's a full moon. I'll be busy tonight"",' she said. 'There was a . study about 20 years ago at a hospital near the River Thames which is a . tidal river and it showed that on the full moon they did have more . births. 'The idea is that because the baby is . surrounded by water, the time of the full moon and the high tide causes . the waters to break. But there's not enough scientific evidence to show . it's proven.' Waiting game: Members of the world's media gathered outside The Lindo Wing when The Duchess Of Cambridge went into labour at St Mary's Hospital in London this morning . Birth coach Zara de Candole, of Doula UK, said: 'As a doula (birth coach) who has supported many women in labour, there does seem to be some link between labour kick starting and a full moon.' There are also suggestions electrical storms and a drop in barometric pressure can bring on labour. Western central London - near William and Kate's Kensington Palace apartment - experienced isolated heavy rain, thunder and lightning strikes at 6am this morning - just at Kate was admitted to the Lindo wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington. Chris Burton, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'We've had high pressure with the sunshine but now there's low pressure and it's hot and humid which can cause thunder storms.'","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge welcomed a son at 4.24pm this afternoon, making him a Cancer.

Traitor: Edward Devenney was caught by MI5 trying to leak to the Russians and now faces jail . Grinning as he poses with a rifle in his hands, this is the embittered Royal Navy officer facing jail for trying to betray his country. Edward Devenney, 30, offered sensitive military information to two men he believed to be Russian spies. The petty officer boasted that he had secret details of the movements of nuclear submarines and the workings of a device used to encrypt coded messages. But the pair were really British agents who were covertly recording the meeting – and Devenney, who had vowed to 'hurt' the Navy after a promotion was scrapped due to budget cuts, was arrested soon afterwards. At the Old Bailey in London yesterday, he pleaded guilty to amassing information in breach of the Official Secrets Act between last November and this March, and misconduct in a public office. He faces up to 14 years in jail when sentenced next month. The court heard that as well as offering the supposed spies details of an Enigma-style 'cryptography' device used for coded messages, Devenney also offered secret information about the movements of two submarines carrying nuclear missiles. The case raises worrying questions about Royal Navy vetting procedures given Devenney's history. In the months leading up to his arrest in March, he had been posting up to 40 messages a day on Twitter discussing his submarine and his anti-Government views. In addition, two years ago he had gone on trial for raping a young woman with learning difficulties. Although he was cleared, the court heard seedy details of his personal life, which involved him betraying girlfriend Charlotte Turner to have a threesome with two other women, and having sex with the alleged rape victim while on aphrodisiac drug amyl nitrate, or 'poppers' – use of which is a dismissable offence in the services. Enemy: Petty officer Devenney holding a gun and was offering military secrets to an 'enemy' foreign embassy in London . Representatives of the Royal Navy had looked on at the rape trial as Devenney's own lawyer called him a 'cad and a chancer'. Devenney, the son of a warehouseman . from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, joined the Navy as a . school-leaver, rising to petty officer. He was then sponsored to study . for a degree in electronic engineering, before winning a place on a . course to become a commissioned officer. It was during a study period in 2009, . while living with girlfriend Miss Turner, 27, an emergency ward nurse, . in Plymouth, that he was charged with rape.

Scandal: Devenney was filmed by MI5 trying to give away tightly-held British secrets to two fake Russian agents . Devenney admitted having . casual sex three times with his accuser, whose learning difficulties . were so great she struggled giving evidence. The jury cleared him of . rape. After being cleared, Devenney went . straight back to work, first on hunter killer submarine Trafalgar, and . then on Vigilant, which carries nuclear missiles. He developed a grudge, however, when told that budget cuts had ended his chances of becoming a commissioned officer.

Last November, he attempted to contact . the Russian embassy – but it was undercover British agents who arranged . to meet him in London in January. At an earlier hearing, prosecutor . Mari Read said: 'He gave them information about his submarine including . maintenance periods, refitting work and firing test missiles. 'He also told them about sailing dates and destinations.' Devenney, who has admitted travelling . overseas without informing superiors as required, had been a heavy . drinker and was considered a suicide risk. He has been in custody since . his March arrest. His defence barrister, Lord Carlile . QC, claimed at the earlier hearing that his client had been depressed . since his rape trial and the 'secret' information was worthless. But an intelligence source said . Devenney's leaks could have been passed from Russia to Iran, focusing on . secret submarine manoeuvres in the Persian Gulf. Last night a Royal Navy source told . the Daily Mail: 'Devenney was a bit of a Walter Mitty character, a . dreamer. We were keeping a very close eye on him.

Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg is demanding Britain remains signed up to the European arrest warrant . Britain risks becoming a 'safe haven for Europe's criminals' if it withdraws from cross-border police powers, Nick Clegg warned today. The Deputy Prime Minister is demanding Britain remain signed up to the European Arrest Warrant or he will veto Tory demands to opt out of more than 100 other justice measures. The stand-off risks a major Coalition row as both parties seek to appeal to their grassroots in the wake of the Eastleigh by-election. Home Secretary Theresa May has a list of 130 criminal justice measures the Government wants to take back from Brussels. Ministers will then opt back in to some measures later. But talks have threatened to break down, with Tories wanting to quit almost all of the EU rules while Lib Dems want to remain sign up to many more. After meeting crime campaginers today, Mr Clegg warned national security could be at risk if Britain pulled out of 'essential' crime-fighting measures. The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'While some measures of European co-operation on crime are old, out of date or defunct, the police and other law enforcement agencies consistently tell us that other measures are essential for our national security and public safety. 'The European Arrest Warrant is one of those key measures. Without it, victims of crime like Maggie may never have seen those who beat her son nearly to death brought to justice, and as the police say, without it Britain could become a safe haven for Europe’s criminals. 'We want to improve the way the arrest warrant works. That’s why we’re introducing some changes domestically, and why we’re talking to our European partners about reform. But this key crime fighting tool should be reformed, not abandoned. 'Britain has a long and proud track record of leadership in the fight against organised crime and illegal immigration. I want to see us continuing to lead internationally on this agenda in to the future.' The European arrest warrant allows the UK to extradite swiftly criminals from other EU member states. David Cameron needs Lib Dem votes to win a Commons vote on the issue. Mr Clegg today campaign groups Justice Across Borders and Anti-Slavery UK. They were joined by former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross and Maggie Hughes, whose son Robbie was severely beaten in Crete in 2008. Mr Hughe's attackers were brought to justice in 2012 after being arrested in the UK under a European Arrest Warrant. After the meeting, Ms Hughes said: 'We need to keep what we’ve already got, because without the European arrest warrant we may never have got the suspects back to Greece and justice for Robbie. 'My son’s ability and other people’s children's ability to get justice should not be threatened by ideological battles in Westminster. 'No one has told me what the good reasons are to pull out of this cooperation, and Mr Clegg agreed we must protect the EAW and other important measures.' David Cameron is under pressure from his MPs to quit more than 100 EU powers on crime and justice, but needs Lib Dem support to win a Commons vote . In a speech last year Mr Clegg warned withdrawing from the arrest warrant would leave British police trying to fight crime 'to protect the British people with one hand tied behind their back'. 'Our police can call on the resources and intelligence of the entire European crime-fighting community to hunt down and arrest murderers and escaped convicts, to stop billions from being laundered out of the UK every year,' he said to Chatham House. 'To anyone who says we don’t need these EU measures to fight crime and terrorism effectively, I say prove it. 'Prove it to the police, the intelligence agencies, the lawyers, the victims of crime charities. Prove it to the people who deal day in day out with the worst criminals imaginable. 'Because my position is clear: I will not ask them to protect the British people with one hand tied behind their back.' Ahead of today's meeting, Justice Across Borders Director Thais Portilho-Shrimpton said: ‘We are a team of campaigners representing victims of egregious crimes perpetrated in the UK and abroad, including human trafficking and slavery. She added: ‘We hope to get assurances from the Deputy Prime Minister that the Lib Dems will not agree to this opt out and put in danger instruments such as the European Arrest Warrant and valuable agencies such as Europol, which has recently been asked by the UK to take the lead in investigating the horsemeat scandal.’ However, the Tories have made clear they will not sign up to a raft of Lib Dem demands leaving negotiaions on the verge of collapse. ‘The Lib Dems tend to err on the side of being more Europhile and we tend to want to sign up to as little as possible,’ said a Conservative source.","Lib Dems threaten to block Conservative demands to opt out of more than 100 EU measures if European Arrest Warrant is dropped .

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 06:47 EST, 5 October 2011 . Obsessed: Prison diaries kept by Amanda Knox claim that jail guard Raffaele Argiro repeatedly quizzed her about previous lovers . Amanda Knox was repeatedly questioned about her sex life by a senior prison guard during the four years she spent in an Italian jail, it has been claimed. The 24-year-old, who landed in her home city of Seattle last night after being cleared of the murder of Meredith Kercher, was reportedly quizzed in Perugia's La Capanne jail by deputy prison chief Raffaele Argiro. The Italian prison guard was 'obsessed' with talking to Knox about her sex life and often called the American into his office for late-night 'chit chats', according to The Sun. The revelations were made by Knox in a written account of her four-year stint in La Capanne prison, Perugia, during which she was initially convicted of killing British student Meredith, 21. Knox is reported to have said of guard Argiro: 'He was fixed on the topic of sex - who I'd done it with and how I liked it.' 'When I realised he wanted to talk to me about sex, I would try to change the subject.' Knox's prison journal also claims that Argiro accompanied her on all medical visits at the jail, and would quiz her on her sex life as a form of provocation to test her mental state. The revealing account of her time in jail in Perugia even claims that she was told she was HIV positive just days after being locked up. She had an agonising two-week wait before a further test showed she was negative, according to the prison diary. The diary adds: 'I realise he was . testing me to see if I reacted badly, to understand my personality. He . also wanted to know with whom I had gone to bed, probably to give the . police other names of suspects.' Argiro is pictured, left, leading Knox from court in Perugia after the dramatic overturning of her murder conviction on Monday night . Ordeal: Knox spent four years in Perugia's La Capanne jail, during which she was convicted of Meredith Kercher's killing and handed a life sentence which has since been quashed . The Sun reported that when approached, Argiro admitted asking Knox privately about how many boyfriends she had had. However, the senior guard denied he initiated the intimate conversations, and said it was Knox who 'always' started talking about sex. Quizzed: Argiro, seen here leading Knox into court for a hearing in July, reportedly questioned the American about Meredith Kercher's killing to 'test her personality' Argiro also reportedly confessed he was present when Knox underwent medical tests 'in case she did something wrong', before also admitting to quizzing her about Meredith's death in a bid to build the prosecution against her. The revelations came as Knox touched down at Seattle-Tacoma Airport at around 5pm yesterday, following a £4,000 business class BA flight from Rome to Seattle. After dramatically being cleared of the murder in court on Monday, Knox made an emotional thank you speech from the airport, addressing all those who stood by her since her murder conviction and saying: 'Thank you for being there for me'. Summoning the courage to speak after her flight touched down, she said: 'I’m really overwhelmed right now. I was looking down from the aeroplane, I felt like it wasn’t real. 'Thank you for everyone who has believed in me, who has defended me, who has supported my family. 'I just want – my family’s the most important thing to me... Thank you for being there for me.' Her appearance was met with loud applause from those who had waited all day at the airport to see her. Looking ahead: Amanda Knox speaks at a press conference at Seattle airport. In an emotional speech she thanked those who had stood by her since her murder conviction . Tearful: Amanda Knox was freed on Monday after . an Italian appeals court threw out her murder conviction for the death . of her British room mate, Meredith Kercher. Welcome home: Amanda Knox arrived back at her family home in Seattle yesterday evening . The language student is thought to be spending time with family and friends before considering her next move as a free woman. She had served four years of a 26-year prison sentence after being found guilty in 2009 of the brutal sex murder of Meredith, 21, who was found semi naked with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house the girls shared in Perugia, Italy. Former love: Knox is hoping to be reunited with David Johnsrud who was her boyfriend before she left for Italy . Knox has been planning her home-coming celebration in detail since the early days of her incarceration, drawing up an exhaustive list of things she wants to do now she is finally free. Notes from the diary that detectives encouraged her to keep reveal the extensive plans she had made, and even the list of 42 guests. Taking pride of place will have been her maths teacher, mother and stepfather, Chris Mellas, her father Curt, a financial executive, and his wife Cassandra, plus her sister Deanna, 22, and stepsisters Ashley, 16, and Delaney, 13, all of whom were at court on Monday and led the cheering. She now also hopes to be reunited with David Johnsrud, the boyfriend with whom she broke up when they left the University of Washington to travel on exchange programmes, he to China, she to Perugia. Knox has already been offered £650,000 by a U.S. television station for a first interview, and according to experts could earn as much as £50m from lucrative book, TV and film deals. Amanda Knox received a hero’s welcome in prison when she returned for the final time before she left to fly home to America. When she returned to Capanne prison to collect her belongings after dramatically being acquitted by the appeals court, hundreds of fellow inmates cheered from their cells, leaning out of windows and chanting her name. ‘All the prisoners, 500 or 600 of them, started to greet Amanda from the windows, like soccer stardom,’ Corrado Maria Daclon, secretary general of the USA Italy Foundation, said. ‘It's difficult to describe the happiness of them seeing Amanda and greeting her and seeing her free now - yelling, 'Oh, wow, ciao Amanda!' It was really, really incredible emotion.’ Daclon told ABC News that as Knox walked through the prison’s central square, which is surrounded by prison blocks, inmates leant out of their tiny windows, waving their clothes in the air, like flags. ‘All the prison was greeting her like a champion,’ he said. He added that she was so taken by the greeting, she jumped up and down in the air like a child. ‘She was moved and jumped two times to greet them,’ he said. ‘She was so touched, you can't imagine.’","Prison also told Knox she had HIV before further test returned negative .

A grieving twin has pledged to complete the bucket list her sister never could - and demands on it include going to a gay bar, getting arrested, and 'farting loudly in a lift'. Cystic fibrosis sufferer Nicole Tennant, 21, had been preparing for a life-changing double lung transplant last month when she took an unexpected turn. Her twin Melissa was in Marbella when she got the call saying Nicole had just hours to live. She rushed back to Gartnavel Hospital in Glasgow in time to say a final goodbye. Wicked sense of humour: Nicole Tennant, who died last month aged 21, and wrote a bucket list that her twin sister Melissa is planning on completing for her . Now Melissa is determined to complete her sister's 57 bucket list wishes, which includes getting tattoos, jumping out of a plane and posing naked for a life art class. She has already bought a pair of shoes worth more than £100 - some pink strappy high-heels from Dune - and named a star Nicole Tennant. Melissa said: 'Nicole wrote down so many things she wanted to do but her illness didn't allow her to do them. 'It's funny how many of them involved nudity! But that was Nicole - she loved a laugh. 'One thing I don't do is heights so I won't be jumping out of any planes, but I'll do everything else I can. 'I've had friends and family, some overseas in Canada and New Zealand, get in touch to say they want to help, which is just as well.' Doing it for my sister: Melissa Tennant is planning on carrying out everything on the bucket list of her late sister Nicole . The girls' father Stewart, 59, said: 'I think Nicole was a wee bit fly when making that list. 'It's as if she knew she wouldn't manage to do all of those things herself and that Melissa would end up taking it on. She had a wicked sense of humour.' When Melissa made it to the hospital Nicole was already unconscious. Melissa said: 'She could hear me, she definitely could. I said ""I love you"" and she twitched. She knew better than to die before I got back to see her one more time. 'Nicole was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis as a baby but all the way through primary we were very similar. 'It was in high school that our lives became very different. She was in and out of hospital and taking up to 30 pills a day and on oxygen 24/7. Our parents bought a camcorder to take with us on holiday when we were five and there's footage of Nicole singing Al Jolson songs, flinging back her feeding tube as if it was her hair. 'That's what she was like. She was positive and funny and tried to make us all feel good.' The girls: Melissa, left, and Nicole were very similar throughout primary school but their lives became different in high school when Nicole started spending more time in hospital and taking up to 30 pills a day . The family also hope to start a trust fund in Nicole's name to support young cystic fibrosis sufferers and their families. Their mother Agnes, 56, said: 'There are no respite centres for cystic fibrosis sufferers in Scotland, and I know it would have really helped us when Nicole was unwell.' Once charitable status has been confirmed, people will be able to donate to the trust and log on to the site to watch Melissa and her friends power through the list. 1. Get a tattoo . 2.

Recovering female alcoholics are more likely to relapse because Alcoholics Anonymous does little to understand the reasons behind their drinking, according to a new study. John Kelly, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital, and his colleague Bettina Hoeppner found that male and female alcoholics drink for different reasons. Men are more likely to relapse when they are in . social-drinking situations, whereas women tend to drink when they are feeling down.

"By . James Chapman . UPDATED: . 05:53 EST, 3 October 2011 . Insistence: Iain Duncan Smith has said the policy of tax breaks for married couples must be implemented and will use his conference speech today to remind the Prime Minister . Tax breaks for married couples must be implemented before the next election as David Cameron promised, Iain Duncan Smith will insist today. The Work and Pensions Secretary will use his conference speech to remind the Prime Minister about the policy, which MPs fear has slipped down the agenda thanks to the power-sharing deal with the Lib Dems. Mr Duncan Smith, the leading Cabinet champion of the policy, will also insist the Government must do more to reverse the bias against couples in the tax and benefit system. And he will signal new sanctions for benefit claimants who refuse to take jobs, promising a new ‘contract’ which will ‘bring to an end the something-for-nothing culture’. ‘Fail to seek work, take work, stay in work or co-operate, and you will lose your benefits,’ he will say. A poll for the think tank Mr Duncan Smith set up in opposition has identified overwhelming support for a recognition in the tax system for marriage. The YouGov survey for the Centre for Social Justice found two-thirds of voters  support the idea, suggesting it enjoys support well beyond those who have tied the knot. The CSJ today publishes a ‘manifesto for the family’, which is designed as a wake-up call to the Government on the issue of family breakdown and the need for tangible support for marriage. It calls for ministers to speak up more clearly in support of the institution of marriage, remove the penalty against couples in the benefits system, and reject plans to make divorce easier. Clear pledge: David Cameron has previously said that he will recognise marriage in the tax system and do so before the end of this Parliament . Mr Duncan Smith will tell the conference that the role of the family is ‘one of the most important issues for our country’. ‘This isn’t about government interfering in family life; it’s about government recognising that stable two-parent families are vital for the creation of a strong society,’ he will say. ‘It’s about parents taking responsibility for their children. It is about government realising that we have to create a level playing field for the decisions people make about family. ‘This means reversing the biases against stability we’ve seen in recent years, including the damaging financial discouragement to couple formation, despite the evidence of its stable outcomes for children. ‘We also need to make sure that support is available when families most need it. That’s why I intend for our welfare reforms to make an impact on the couple penalty where it matters most – amongst families on the lowest incomes. ‘Furthermore, the Prime Minister has made it clear that in this Parliament the Government will recognise marriage in the tax system.’ Right signal: Gavin Poole said that the introduction of a tax break would show society that marriage is a stabilising factor and contributes to the welfare of both adults and children . Before the election, the Tories proposed a transferable allowance which would apply to all married couples – and gay couples in civil partnerships – who pay the basic rate of income tax. Spouses not using all of their tax-free personal allowance – either because they stay at home or work part-time and earn less than £6,600 – were to be able to transfer £750 of their benefit to their working partner. Eligible couples where one partner is not using all the tax-free personal allowance and the other earns between £6,600 and £44,000 would be up to £150 a year better off. But the issue went on the back burner in coalition talks with the Lib Dems, who fiercely oppose special recognition for marriage. Mr Cameron has said since the election that he intends to honour the pledge before 2015, but Chancellor George Osborne suggested last week there would be no room for tax cuts before the election. As well as identifying strong support for marriage tax breaks, the poll for the CSJ found that, in the wake of the summer riots, more than 80 per cent say they regard family breakdown as a ‘serious’ problem facing society. Gavin Poole, CSJ executive director, said: ‘Restoring a tax break for marriage would provide help to families and send a signal right through society that marriage is a stabilising factor and contributes to the welfare of adults and children alike.’ She may once have been dubbed the Tory Party’s ‘secret weapon’, but Samantha Cameron is not known for her deep interest in politics. And yesterday she underlined the point by making a discreet exit from the Conservative Party conference three hours before it had even started. Discreet exit: Samantha Cameron posed for photos with her husband but just minutes later was returning to London to look after their children. She will return to the conference on Tuesday . Mrs Cameron travelled to Manchester on Saturday and accompanied her husband while he did a round of television interviews yesterday morning. She posed for pictures with him outside the conference hotel, in a £220 beige Nicole Farhi jacket teamed with a black £15.99 top from the high street store Zara and black cropped trousers from Joseph costing £165. But minutes later she was packing her bags and heading back to London to look after the couple’s children. On her arrival in Manchester, she wore £39.99 orange trousers and a £19.99 grey top both from Zara. High street chic: Samantha Cameron teamed orange trousers and a grey top, both from Zara, for her arrival at the conference with her husband . Today, while her husband puts the finishing touches to his speech, she is expected at work at the upmarket stationery firm Smythson where she is a part-time consultant. Sources suggested she would return on Tuesday, on the eve of the Prime Minister’s speech to conference. She was not the only political wife to bow out of Manchester yesterday – William Hague’s wife Ffion  departed shortly after the Foreign Secretary addressed the conference.",Work and Pensions Secretary will remind Prime Minister about pledge in conference speech .

As the face of Dolce and Gabbana his chiselled cheeky bones and rock hard abs have graced the cover of countless high fashion magazines, he has stalked hundreds of runways and his latest project is a steamy new video for shoe brand Bionda Castana. Now one of his co-stars in the advert model Doris Anna has spoken out about her raunchy scenes with the 33 year old hunk, describing him as a ‘pure sex dream’. Doris Anna plays one of the many girls David seduces and beds in the film advertising Bionda Castana shoes . Sexy David apparently moves in slow motion in real life and is a 'pure sex dream' The film ends as Gandy walks away with his true passion - loads of pairs of high heels swung over his shoulder . Reading a little like a ’50 shades’ novel, Doris Anna says of her sexy scene with the Essex-born model: ‘Gandy slowly slipped off my boots. His eyes did not leave mine as he gently placed his hands under my thigh and stroked my leg, working his way up to my foot.’ Despite the seductive feel of the finished product, Doris Anna says that during filming, her mind was flooded by less than glamorous thoughts. Speaking to Buzzfeed, she admits that as David stroked up her leg she began to panic that she hadn’t shaved her legs that day, and that, having been wearing her Bionda Castana shoes on set all day, that her feet might smell when David removed them. ‘I cringed a bit because at that moment, I thought what every girl would think: Did I shave last night?’ However, it seems David’s natural charisma over shadowed the awkward reality of filming. ‘He really does move in slow motion in real life. ‘He needs no direction — he simply needs to be unleashed and allowed to work his magic,’ the model gushes. The fashion films sees Gandy smoulder his way from bar to bedroom with numerous beautiful women. After a steamy night between the sheets, the women wake to find Gandy has made off with their Bionda Castana heels. Despite the passion portrayed in the film, Dorris Anna admits she was more worried about her unshaven legs and smelly feet . The film was produced by Friends star David Schwimmer and his wife Zoe Buckman, who were both on the set during shooting. In fact, so bleary eyed was Doris Anna when she arrived for the 5.45am call that she mistook David Schwimmer for David Gandy! It was only Schwimmer’s ever present form, Doris Anna says, that kept her grounded in the reality that she was on a set, and not actually being seduced by Gandy. David shows why he is considered by many the best looking man alive. He was pictured doing looking effortlessly cool at a Johnnie Walker party aboard a luxury yacht on the Thames last Friday .

Children born in Atlanta, Detroit, Cleveland and Cincinnati are far less likely to pull themselves out of poverty than those whose parents earn the same amount of money in San Jose, San Francisco, Seattle and New York, a fascinating new study has shown. Top economists at Harvard and University of California, Berkeley analyzed millions of anonymous earnings records to compare income mobility across metropolitan areas - and the results are surprising. Living in an area with higher average incomes, larger tax credits for the poor or more local colleges does not necessarily improve the chances of someone rising beyond the station of their birth. But four broad factors did appear to have an affect, researchers pointed out, and they included the size and dispersion of the local middle class. The city where you live: The interesting study found the odds of rising to another income level are notably lower in certain cities, like Atlanta, and much higher in places like New York . If all else was equal, Americans living in cities with poor families more dispersed among mixed-income neighborhoods are more likely to climb the income ladder. Children growing up in areas with more two-parent households, better elementary schools and high schools, and more civic engagement, including membership in religious and community groups, were also more able to pull themselves out of poverty and up the income scale. 'Where you grow up matters,' Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and one of the study’s authors, told The New York Times. 'There is tremendous variation across the U.S. in the extent to which kids can rise out of poverty.' Atlanta: Children born in Atlanta, pictured, are far less likely to pull themselves out of poverty than those whose parents earn the same amount of money in other cities . Where you lived matters less for well-off children than for middle-class and poor children, the researchers found. The chances that wealthy children grow up to be wealthy are broadly similar across all cities it appears. Metropolitan areas with larger black . populations had lower upward-mobility rates, but the researchers . believed this was not primarily because of their race. For example, both . white and black residents of Atlanta have low upward mobility, The . Times reported. Interestingly . Atlanta and Seatle have a similar average income, yet the difference . between upward mobility rates in the two cities are stark. On . average, fairly poor children in Seattle — those who grew up in the . 25th percentile of the national income distribution — do as well . financially when they grow up as middle-class children — those who grew . up at the 50th percentile — from Atlanta, according to The Times. Moving up the ladder: The study found children living in parts of California and the Northeast were far more likely to climb the income ladder than areas with the same average income in other parts of the country . Yet, children who moved from a city with poor rates of income mobility to a city with higher mobility rates at a young age were found to do almost as well at climbing the income ladder as kids who lived their whole lives in the latter region. If they moved as teenagers, however, they did less well, suggesting the characteristics of different regions rather than something inherent and unchangeable in the residents is responsible. The researchers pointed out that their data allowed them to identify only correlations not the causes for the intriguing patterns they discovered.","Harvard and University of California, Berkeley researchers analyzed millions of earnings records to compare income mobility across US cities .

But for Carole and Michael Middleton, it was more momentous than most. For as this middle-class couple from Buckinghamshire gazed down at their own flesh and blood, they were looking into the scrunched up face of the future King of England. Carole and Michael arrived at St Mary's hospital in Paddington just after 3pm today. And of course Carole, an attractive . woman with a keen fashion sense, was sure to look perfectly polished for this high profile moment. Perhaps giving a nod to the gender of the baby, Carole chose a belted silk tea dress in a muted blue shade by Irish designer Orla Kiely. Scroll down for video . First visitors: Carole Middleton and Michael Middleton at St Mary's Hospital at around 3pm today . The dress was the Dancing Girl tea dress from the Orla Kiely 2012 spring/summer collection. It is no longer on sale at the store, but is likely to have cost around £160. Carole paired the dress with, what else, nude pumps. Though while Kate favours the LK Bennett sledge, Carole wore the Russell & Bromley Chic Pump mid-heel court, £175. The Middletons became the very first members of the family to meet the Duke and Duchess's new . son, almost 23 hours after the infant was born. Until then the new parents had spent time bonding together with their baby. ‘He’s beautiful. They are both doing really well. We are so thrilled,’ Carole told the gathered Press outside the Lindo Wing after their hour and a quarter-long visit. She said the new parents were doing ‘fabulously’ - but wouldn't be drawn over the issue of naming the baby. No suggestions from them, them? ‘Absolutely not!’ said Carole. Carole and Michael arrived a short while after Kate's hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker, unofficially confirmed that the Duke and Duchess would be departing today by arriving at the back entrance of the Lindo Wing wheeling along her kit bag. The Middletons paused only for the briefest of moments at the top of the steps at the front entrance of the Lindo Wing before disappearing inside, no doubt eager to meet the new arrival. The boy, who is third in line to the throne, will be the first monarch of the 22nd century, and will succeed his father William, making him third in the line of Kings that will follow on from the Queen's lengthy reign. Kate, William and the new baby are expected to make their own appearance on the steps of the Lindo Wing, just like Charles and Diana did before them, at around 6pm today. Delighted: The two were all smiles as they arrived at the Lindo Wing . Grandmother of the monarch: Carole and Michael are now linked by bloodline to the throne . A member of the Royal household . arrived at the same time as the hairstylist, carrying an opaque dress . bag that looked to be holding at least three garments, thought to be the . selection of dresses Kate will choose from to make her first appearance . as a mother. Speculation raged over what the Duchess might wear - but the odds were on her choosing a blue dress by a British designer. As for other visitors, Royal watchers initially said we were unlikely to see any of the major Royals arrive at the hospital, mainly owing to the increased security it would demand. Early reports suggested police presence would have to be upped sixfold if the Queen were to attend St Mary's - and the Royals would likely deem there had already been enough disruption to the running of the hospital and the areas around it. The wait is over! Carole and Michael arrived at the hospital by London taxi . But over the past hour, onlookers . outside St Mary's have reported an increase in police presence that . could either herald the departure of Kate and William - or the arrival . of Royal visitors. Charles and Camilla are thought to be the most likely to be the next to arrive. On Royal duties elsewhere, Sophie Wessex said she feels 'ridiculously happy' about the birth. 'It is a wonderful event. I'm hoping in the next few days to catch up with them,' she said. 'I . have sent messages but haven't visited. Having had babies myself I know . you really want to close down the hatches and be with your immediate . family for the first few days and weeks. 'I never expected to feel quite this happy but I've had a big smile on my face every since the news broke. ' Runs in the family: The Middleton clan favour a nude pump - and Carole is no exception.

The stylists assistant arrives carrying a suitcase and a dress hidden beneath a protective sheet . It was one of the first clues that the Duke and Duchess would be leaving the hospital with their little prince today: Kate's hair stylist arriving at the Lindo Wing. Accompanied by her assistant - who was carrying a baby car seat and a dress bag - the royal hairstylist, who also does the hair of Prince William and Prince Harry - arrived at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington shortly before Kate's parents Carole and Michael Middleton. Amanda Cook Tucker, 50, often styles Kate's hair at home and has been cutting William and Harry's hair for years.

Amanda Cook Tucker has been Kate's hairdresser since the couple visited the Far East on a Diamond Jubilee Visit in September last year. The blonde stylist was credited with giving Kate heat-proof hair that defied the humid Asian weather. Previously Kate was a long-term client of the Richard Ward celebrity salon in Chelsea. A source told the Mail on Sunday's Katie Nicholl last year: 'Amanda is an expert at what Kate loves – full glossy blow dries that hold.' Mrs Cook Tucker’s ex-husband Neville Tucker also has Royal connections. His Knightsbridge salon held the Royal Warrant from 1980 to 1994 and he worked closely with the Queen’s longest-serving hairdresser, Charles Martyn. The Prince of Wales paid the cost of Mrs Cook Tucker throughout the tour last autumn, believed to be £300 a day plus travel costs. A spokesman for the Duchess at the time said: ‘The Duchess’s hairdresser on the tour is a private individual paid for privately.'

Campaign: Roy West, 48, has been jailed for 14 weeks after being convicted of racially aggravated harassment . A neighbour from hell has been jailed after waging a five-year racist hate campaign against a German man living next door. Roy West, 48, repeatedly called Bernd Kugow a 'kraut b*****d' during Basil Fawlty-like rants, as well as planting poppies in his back garden and draping a Union Flag over the neighbours' shared shed in Greater Manchester. The campaign of abuse from West, which dates back to August 2008, led to him being sentenced to 14 weeks in prison at Tameside Magistrates' Court after he was convicted of breaching a restraining order and ignoring an earlier suspended jail term. The former BNP candidate was also given a new, two-year restraining order. West denied any wrongdoing. On one occasion West built a display of poppies and flags then placed it so only Mr Kugow, 51, and his British born-partner Susan Holt, 57, could see it. Another time when Mr Kugow protested at his neighbour’s conduct, West retorted: 'F*****g kraut, get back to f*****g kraut land - remember Dunkirk?' Jobless West was eventually given a restraining order banning him from contacting Mr Kugow and Miss Holt after he was convicted of racially aggravated harassment. But he was arrested again after posting a rambling clip of himself on YouTube in which he holds up a DVD claiming it was 'evidence' that his neighbours had been 'spying on him' with a CCTV camera. Police were initially called to deal with West in 2008 after he flew into an expletive-ridden rage when Mr Kugow objected to his Union Flag being draped over their joint garden shed. Mr Kugow, a personal assistant who has lived in the UK for 23 years, and Miss Holt were preparing to go away for a week when they saw West trying to hang the flag over the shared building. Mr Kugow went out to tell West he didn’t want it hanging over his property and threatened to take the Union Flag down himself if his neighbour left it up. But furious West vowed to re-hang the flag on the side of his house in Dukinfield. During a 20 minute rant West yelled: 'If you come into this f*****g garden you won’t get out alive because I’ll kill you. 'You are a ‘f*****g kraut, get back to f*****g kraut land.' The victim later told a court hearing: 'He tried to attach the flag to the side of the house but it wouldn’t stay up and he lost his cool. It was the worst abuse that I have ever heard. He said ""go back to kraut land you kraut bastard"", and ""remember Dunkirk"". 'It carried on for about 20 minutes. He then took a Union Flag down and put a Cornish flag up and put the Union Flag out of his window outside. 'It made me feel terrible and no-one should get away with someone talking like that. It made me feel upset. 'Susan went round to his house to see how we could resolve matters. He then came round apologising and crying and brought a box of Roses for us.' Scroll down for video . Harassment: Roy West hung Union Flags at his house (left) in Greater Manchester and planted poppies in his back garden to goad his German next door neighbour . Restraining order: West continued harassing Bernd Kugow despite being given a suspended jail sentence and placed under a restraining order . Mr Kugow added: 'I don’t think that Mr West has ever been to Dunkirk. I have lived here for a number of years and people have said funny comments and what he said about Dunkirk was fine - it was just the other words that he said. 'I wouldn’t have called the police if he had just said ""remember Dunkirk"". I called the police because the other things that he said.' In 2009 West was fined £125 and ordered to pay £50 pounds compensation to Mr Kugow for harassing the couple. But last year he was back in court after putting poppies and flags outside the victim’s property on Armistice Day - then adding to the display over the next four months. When Miss Holt asked West to remove part of it from the shared wall last month, he replied: ‘Kraut b*****d'. Rants: West's German neighbour and his British-born partner said the 48-year-old's behaviour had had a 'devastating' impact on their lives . Expletives: West's racist rants at his neighbour call to mind the TV character Basil Fawlty, whose deranged goose-stepping in front of German guests is one of the most famous scenes in Fawlty Towers . She told another court hearing: 'The reason the flags and poppies are facing into our garden is because Bernd is German. 'West wants to change this to make it look like we’re against the poppies and flags, which isn’t true. 'That display originally appeared on the front wall facing to the road to mark Armistice Day, which is right and proper. 'But some weeks after that it was placed on the dividing wall facing our garden. 'If you look at it from West’s garden you couldn’t see anything, it was solely for us to look at. We are private people who never wanted any of this. 'It’s had a devastating impact on our lives and we just want to get back to being private individuals. I just want the harassment to stop.' In May 2012 West was given a 12-month restraining order preventing him from making direct or indirect contact with Mr Kugow or Miss Holt and forbidding him mentioning or referring to them on the internet via social networking, blogging and discussion forums. He also received a 12 month suspended sentence with a 12-week curfew. But the following November he posted a video on YouTube in which he was seen holding up a copy of a DVD which contained footage of a CCTV camera installed on Mr Kugow’s house. Defence lawyer Ian Ridgeway said: 'Mr West has his rant on the video because he was not able to play the DVD at his earlier trial. He had fallen out with his neighbours and is not the most popular person in the area. 'He held a genuine belief that he could have his rant without specifically referring to them.' But passing sentence District Judge Khalid Qureshi told West: 'It’s clear to me this was a deliberate breach of an order imposed to try and deal with the problem your neighbours suffered from your behaviour. 'The restraining order was entirely appropriate. It’s blatantly obvious that your behaviour amounted to a breach of that order - you caused the action so you have to take the consequences. 'While you co-operated in regard to the community aspect of the sentence, the aggravating factor is is that your behaviour was identical to the behaviour that made you the subject of the order in the first place. 'It’s clear to me that immediate custody is appropriate in the circumstances.'","Roy West repeatedly called his German neighbour a 'kraut b*****d'

Asthma patients in England and Wales are to be denied a life-changing drug available in Scotland (file picture) Asthma patients in England and Wales are to be denied a life-changing drug that is available on the health service in Scotland. Doctors and charities are dismayed at the decision to withdraw the drug, Xolair, which can halve the risk of an asthma attack. It has ‘dramatically improved’ patients’ quality of life and has also halved the numbers taken to hospital because of asthma attacks, they say. They warn that the decision by drug rationing body Nice would create a ‘health apartheid’ between Scotland and England and Wales. ‘This drug is very effective for patients with severe allergic asthma and dramatically improves their quality of life,’ said Dr Andrew Menzies-Gow, a consultant in respiratory medicine at the Royal Brompton Hospital, London. He said he will be faced with patients whose symptoms are as bad as those he is currently treating, but they will have to make do with steroids. Nice – the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence – insists the drug is not as cost effective as was thought. But Dr Menzies-Gow said the drug cut costs in the long term because it reduced the number of hospital admissions. Neil Churchill of the charity Asthma UK, said: ‘We are surprised and disappointed. Xolair is the only treatment that works for some people. Without it, more will suffer frequent life-threatening asthma attacks and disabling daily symptoms. ‘There is no major evidence to suggest it is any less effective than was previously thought. ‘We urge the maker, Novartis, and Nice to work together to try to find a way to make this vital treatment affordable.’ Around 5.2million Britons have asthma. Treating it costs the UK £1billion a year. The Xolair jab has been used by around 2,000 patients since 2007, when it was approved by Nice. The cost averages around £8,000 per patient a year. Hormone link to wheezing . Asthma attacks occur when the body detects a foreign body but overreacts by producing large amounts of antibodies. Most treatments – such as inhalers and oral steroids – work by suppressing the symptoms but Xolair blocks the allergic triggers responsible for attacks. But now Nice has revised its thinking. If draft guidance issued today goes through, new patients in England and Wales will not be able to get Xolair from early next year. Sir Andrew Dillon of Nice said: ‘New evidence that has become available indicates that it is not as clinically or cost-effective as was first thought.’ The NHS is failing to buy new medicines for patients, putting their health at risk and pushing up hospital costs, says the head of the UK drugs industry. Stephen Whitehead, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: ‘The UK is among the slowest adopter of new medicines in Europe.’","Doctors and charities are dismayed at the decision to withdraw Xolair which can halve the risk of an asthma attack .

Amanda Bynes ignited her trousers and screamed her dog had been burned after allegedly starting a fire on Monday night in a residential driveway. The 27-year-old actress was found by sheriff's deputies about 9pm standing near the fire burning at a house in Thousand Oaks, California, said Captain Don Aguilar of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department on Tuesday. The sheriff's department and fire department both responded to an emergency 911 call of a gasoline tank fire in a driveway, Aguilar said. Scroll below for video . Fire incident: Amanda Bynes, pictured in July in New York City, has been placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold after allegedly starting a fire in a residential driveway in Thousand Oaks, California . The homeowner said deputies later identified the woman as Amanda and said she had burned a part of her own clothing. 'It sounded like her clothing had been sort of singed,' the resident told TMZ. A . passerby named Andrew Liverpool said he was driving along when he saw a . woman with her 'left pant leg on fire' and after he pulled over saw the . woman grab her small dog. Amanda tried to leave in a taxi, but Liverpool said he kept the cab from leaving. 'She was really frantic and she was like ""my dog has been burned,""' Liverpool said. A . male caller to 911 reported a piece of cloth burning on a gasoline tank . on a driveway and a second female caller confirmed a gasoline tank and . fire, according to a report in TMZ. Animal drama: Amanda, shown with her pet dog in July, was with a small dog at the time of the fire incident . Fire starter: Amanda allegedly started a driveway fire involving a small tank of gasoline and cloth that left two burn marks on a stranger's driveway . Amanda was questioned by Ventura County Sheriff's Department deputies who determined she met the criteria for a psychaitric hold and she was detained, Aguilar said. The 5150 hold is named after the California state code that allows for involuntary hospitalisation for a mental health evaluation. A person can be held against their will for up to 72 hours under such a hold. Deputies asked the homeowner if she knew a shorter woman with 'fuzzy blonde hair and carrying a chihuahua' or any reason why a person would set fire to her driveway, the woman told TMZ. Authorities told the woman that a young lady carrying a 'little red gas tank' had lit a fire in her driveway.

And according to TMZ, they are refusing to pay for the fire damage their daughter allegedly caused, saying: 'Amanda needs to pay for it.' Amanda was born and raised in affluent Thousand Oaks, which is about 35 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. She was forced to return home to Southern California after she went broke and was unable to find a place to live in New York City, according to RadarOnline. Odd outing: Amanda shopped in a blonde wig and long T-shirt at Bloomingdales in Santa Monica hours before she was involuntarily hospitalised for a mental evaluation . The decision for Amanda to return to Los Angeles 'was made because she . had run out of money she had access to. Amanda was unable to find any . place to live in New York City because of her bizarre behavior,' a . source told the website. 'No one would rent an apartment to her. She does own a house in .

She was seen shopping in Bloomingdales in Santa Monica on Monday in a matted blonde wig, a long T-shirt and flip-flops. Amanda will not face any criminal charges related to the driveway fire that prompted her involuntary confinement, Aguilar said. Emergency medical responders were at the scene, but there were no injuries and no medical aide was rendered, Aguilar said. Amanda's listed attorneys in an industry database, Richard Hutton and David Feldman, declined to comment on Tuesday to The Associated Press.

Just hours after allegedly shaking his girlfriend's 1-year-old baby so hard that the boy ultimately died, 36-year-old meth addict Bransen Locks was found cowering in a crawl space under his Nevada home and arrested on warrants unrelated to the baby's death. Yesterday, he was charged with murder. According to authorities, Locks was watching his girlfriend's two children - the boy, Bently Olsen, and his 5-year-old sister - on May 19, when Locks' mother called 9-1-1 to report that Bently had been injured. Baby 'killer': Bransen Locks is accused of murdering his girlfriend's 1-year-old son . The boy was rushed to University Medical Center Las Vegas with what first responders described as severe head injuries, including bleeding on the brain and a 'noticeable midline shift of the brain.' Medical personnel also noted a red abrasion on the top of the boy's head that appeared to be 'very recent.' The injuries, doctors concluded, were consistent with shaken baby syndrome. Bently died from his injuries a week later. Locks initially told authorities the boy had suffered a seizure, which is what caused his injuries. But a firefighter who rode to the hospital with Locks and the boy told police he was inconsistent when answering questions about how the boy was injured. When police arrived at the hospital, Locks was gone. He was found a few hours later hiding in the crawl space. In a police interview with Bently's 5-year-old sister, the girl told authorities that Locks hurt her brother in what she called 'brave pokies' while they were playing in a tree house in his backyard. Victim: 1-year-old Bently Olsen died one week after authorities say he was shaken by his mother's drug addict boyfriend . Shaken: doctors say Bently was shaken so hard that there was a 'midline shift of the brain' Following his arrest, Locks' mother told detectives that 'it's been a rough year with [Locks] and his drug problem.' The Clark County coroner's office is yet to release an official cause of death. Locks - who already was behind bars for unrelated, outstanding warrants - has been charged with one count of murder and two counts of child abuse, including causing substantial mental harm to the boy's sister. Locks is due back in court on July 25.","The 1-year-old victim allegedly was shaken so hard that there was a 'midline shift of the brain'

Lawyers for Rolf Harris have used intimidating and potentially misleading tactics to stop The Mail on Sunday from naming the Australian entertainer in the investigation in the wake of the Jimmy Savile abuse claims. In a series of threatening emails sent to this paper, London law firm Harbottle & Lewis warned of the ‘highly damaging personal consequences’ in identifying their client. They also brandished Lord Justice Leveson’s name to declare there was no public interest in reporting the arrest. It meant that for more than four months The Mail on Sunday decided not to publish Mr Harris’s name in connection with the Savile investigation. As recently as March 30, Har¬bottle’s senior media lawyer, . Gerrard Tyrrell, who has acted for Prince William, Prince Harry and the Middletons, warned: ‘If you proceed then both you and the Editor of your newspaper are on notice of the consequences.’ In January, Harbottle’s was asked to confirm if Mr Harris had been interviewed by police. The firm responded by citing cases of Tory peer Lord McAlpine and X Factor judge Louis Walsh, who had been falsely linked to sex offences. In fact, these cases were crucially different from Mr Harris’s because it was true that Mr Harris had been interviewed by the police. And unlike Mr Harris, neither man had been interviewed or arrested. Last night Mr Walsh’s lawyer Paul Tweed said it was wrong to compare his client’s case to that of Mr Harris. He said: ‘The Louis Walsh case I would distinguish because by the time the Sun published the story my client had not been contacted by the police  .  .  .  But in Rolf Harris’s case, as I understand it, he has been interviewed by the police. In my view there is a very important distinction there. Once you reach the point of interview and arrest there has to be a strong public interest argument in publication. The fact that The Mail on Sunday held back for four months is a credit to you.’ Mr Tyrrell also tried to keep the case secret by warning us that it would be wrong to publish any of his threatening letters which he said were ‘strictly private and confidential’. On Friday, despite the desperate efforts by Mr Harris’s lawyers to suppress news of his arrest, . Mr Harris was finally revealed in newspapers as the ‘mystery’ celebrity detained by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex scandal. Without official and cast-iron confirmation from Mr Harris or the police this newspaper decided not to reveal his name. The paper was also influenced by reports that Mr Harris had been admitted to The Priory clinic and that publication could endanger his health. Last night senior lawyers said that media reports were being suppressed in the wake of Lord Justice Leveson’s report into media ethics. Lawyers cited the cases of Louis Walsh (left) and Lord MacAlpine (right) as reason for us not to name Mr Harris . Threat: The emails from Harbottle and Lewis threatening the Mail on Sunday with action if we named Harris . In the email comparing Mr Harris’s situation to Lord McAlpine, Mr Tyrrell said: ‘Given recent events and by this we refer specifically to the unfounded allegations that were published against Lord McAlpine and the reporting on 29 November  2012 of the settlement of legal proceedings brought by Louis Walsh... arising from circumstances where he was falsely accused of criminal behaviour we are very surprised and indeed highly concerned to note the claims to which you refer.’ The ‘claims’, in fact, were only that Mr Harris had been questioned and his house searched. The aggressive denials by Mr Harris’s lawyers . of  their client’s link to the police investigation played an enormous part in  preventing the media from naming him. It is now known that on November 24 last year police searched his home in Bray, Berkshire, and took away computer equipment and other items. Harris, who has denied any wrongdoing, was first interviewed under caution – but not arrested – over alleged sex offences on November 29. On March 28 police formally arrested him. Two days later Mr Tyrrell wrote to the managing editor of The Mail on Sunday after police had appeared to confirm the arrest to one of our reporters. He said: ‘We note that you state  .  .  .you are intending to do what no other organisation in this country has done and publish that our client has been arrested on very serious charges. The highly damaging personal and legal consequences of doing so will not be lost on you.’ Mr Tyrrell dismissed our source, saying that our ‘actual knowledge is non-existent’ and that publication was without any public interest which he said was ‘self-evident’ from Leveson’s report into media ethics. Mr Harris – a favourite of the Queen – had been the only high-profile suspect not to have been identified.His detention follows the arrests of Gary Glitter, Freddie Starr, Dave Lee Travis, Max Clifford and Jim Davidson. Starr, Travis, Clifford and Davidson have all publicly denied any wrong-doing and gave statements after their arrests.

Marsha Ann Stevens put her granddaughter to bed at 9pm on Tuesday night but heard the baby screaming 10 minutes later. The baby's 20-year-old mother Courtney Stevens was also in the house and called 911 when the child began vomiting. Drug use: Marsha Stevens, 36, has been arrested after her 10-month-old granddaughter ingested some of her meth . The baby was taken by ambulance to the St Bernard's Medical Center in Jonesboro, Arkansas but when her condition worsened she was airlifted to the Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock. According to the incident report, hospital staff said the baby's eyes were open wide and she 'could not stay still and was moving constantly and appeared to be very scared.' Young mother: Courtney Stevens, 20, with her 10-month-old daughter . When doctors discovered methamphetamine in the baby's system the police were notified. Officers ran both the Stevens women's names through dispatch and discovered Marsha Stevens had previous arrests for possession of methamphetamine and was already on probation. Stevens senior was arrested at her home on the 400 block of Slate St for introducing a controlled substance to another's body, possession of drug paraphernalia and endangering the welfare of a minor. She was taken to the Craighead County Detention Center. Mother and daughter: Courtney (left) and (right) Marsha Stevens . Courtney Stevens admitted to police that she knew her mother took methamphetamine but said that she herself was clean. In a doorstep interview with a WREH reporter, she said, 'They’re trying to make it like my baby swallowed a whole bag of dope, but no.' Police say that Courtney Stevens told them her mother handed her a plastic sachet of methamphetamine that was 'wet and appeared to have been chewed on,' when the ambulance arrived at their home. She was cited for endangering the welfare of a minor because she knew about her mother's drug use and allowed her to be in an 'unsafe environment'. Removed: The baby daughter and granddaughter of the Stevens women is still in hospital but won't return to the Slate St home when she's discharged . Jailbird: Marsha Stevens is now being held in Craighead Country Detention Center . Two others were arrested at the Stevens home for unrelated offenses.

Horrific: The gaping wound where the bow of a container vessel is believed to have collided with the whale's tail . Horrific: The gaping wound where the bow of a container vessel is believed to have collided with the whale's tail . At 200 tonnes, the blue whale is the largest animal on Earth. Blue whales are the largest animals ever to have lived - they dwarf even the largest of the dinosaurs. Living in the the open ocean, they are found usually found along the continental shelf edges and near polar ice. The blue whale's body can be various shades of bluish-grey dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath. A single calf is produced every two to three years, and from birth each calf consumes up to 50 gallons of milk every single day. In the first year of its life, a calf gains 90 kilograms per day. A blue whale's blood vessels are wide enough for a human to swim through. Its scientific name is Balaenoptera musculus. Marine experts believe the blue whale – an endangered species with as few as 5,000 left in the wild - had been struck by a container vessel. The moving pictures were captured by diver Tony Wu, who wanted to highlight the blue whale’s desperate plight in a bid to reduce devastating ship strikes. He said: 'The whale was collateral damage. It made me incredibly sad to see it in such a state. The animal looked like it had been struck by a ship during the night as it rested at the ocean surface. 'To us, whales are huge. But even then, compared to a fully loaded ship, it would stand practically no chance of surviving a direct hit. It is a big, big problem, especially when endangered species like the blue whale are caught in their path and killed.' Unofficial figures show thousands of whales – many critically endangered species – have been killed by container ships. And experts believe many more cases go unrecorded simply because ships don’t even notice they have hit anything. Tony . added: 'When a big ship hits a whale, the impact wouldn't register. It's like a tractor-trailer hitting a butterfly – you would feel . nothing. 'There are very . active shipping lanes just south of Sri Lanka. Here huge ships travel at . high speeds day and night. It is constant. 'They are ferrying consumer goods and supplies between major ports and could be hitting many more whales than we know about. 'It's not clear how big the problem is because there could be so many unrecorded cases. 'The only statement that can be made . is that ship strikes are a serious problem, and the number of whales . killed by ships is far higher than most people probably understand.'

'One of the toughest issues is that In the case of ship strikes there's no immediate villain, which makes it more difficult to get people worked up about it. 'But in truth, when you look to the bottom line, it is consumers that are responsible. 'Most of the goods being transported when whales are hit are either consumer goods such as appliances, cars, and electronic goods. The problem needs to be looked into most definitely.'","Body of majestic blue whale found floating on surface of Indian Ocean off southern tip of Sri Lanka .

Britain is to sign off taxpayer-funded ‘propaganda’ to promote the virtues European Union despite growing calls to quit Brussels altogether. Tory MPs had called on David Cameron to bring forward legislation in today’s Queen’s Speech for his promised in-out referendum. But instead, buried in the small print, was a plan for the UK to authorise the Europe for Citizens scheme which aims to ‘develop understanding of the EU’. David Cameron, pictured walking from the Commons to the Lords today, is under pressure to take a tougher line on Europe to see off the threat posed by UKIP . There was no mention of Europe in the speech delivered by the Queen to MPs and peers. The Tories are under pressure after the recent rise of the UK Independence Party culminating in them taking almost one in four votes in last week’s local elections. Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU before staging an in-out referendum by 2017, if he is Prime Minister after the next election. But his strategy was blown apart yesterday when former Chancellor Lord Lawson said he would vote to leave the EU. Slipped into the detail of the government’s legislation plans for the next year was the European Union Approvals Bill. There was no mention of Europe in the Queen's Speech, despite the issue threatening to split the Tory party and destablise the coalition . The Queen's Speech contained several measures designed to address concerns raised by UKIP, including tackling immigration . Described as a ‘minor technical Bill’, . it provides authorisation for the UK ‘to support measures and . programmes in the European Union’. Among . three programmes listed, it includes Europe for Citizens which . according to government briefing notes ‘aims to develop understanding of . the EU, its history and policy-making processes and encourage civic . participation in the EU’. It also aims to ‘promote remembrance of Europe’s history, particularly the wars and totalitarian regimes of the 20th century’. The . scheme, which has a 229 million euro budget for 2014-20, claims that . most Europeans 'generally recognise the benefits of the EU' and 'want to . see the Union becoming a more integral part of their national political . landscapes'. By enshrining the Europe for Citizens scheme into British law, the UK will be able to apply for funds . It aims to increase trust in EU institutions, potentially reaching 5million people across the continent. The . revelation is likely to infuriate Tory MPs demanding Mr Cameron take a . tougher line with Brussels instead of backing a scheme which promotes . it. UKIP leader Nigel Farage . said: ‘Hidden beneath the folds of froth Cameron offers a Bill to . approve UK taxpayer spending on EU propaganda. ‘He . promises that he wants to fight Britain’s corner, but spends our money . propagandising on the EU's behalf to our children. By his acts not his . words he must be known.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage accused the government of backing EU 'propaganda' A government source said the scheme needed to be passed into UK law so that ministers can apply for funding from a £200million central pot available to all EU states. Britain would apply for money to pay for projects such as the commemoration for centenary of the outbreak of World War One, not promoting the EU, the source added. Some of the key measures announced in the Queen's Speech were seen as a reaction to the rise of UKIP. In particular, the government promised a crackdown on illegal immigration in the Queen's Speech today as concern about the impact of new arrivals to Britain hit a three-year high. Rogue firms who rent homes and give jobs to illegal immigrants face tougher fines in an immigration crackdown unveiled today in the Queen's Speech. The latest YouGov survey showed 57 per cent of people named immigration as being among the top three issues facing the country, its highest level since June 2010 and up 11 per cent on a year ago. Other flagship bills will cut red-tape to boost business, create a new flat-rate pension worth around £140-a-week, cap the costs of social care to stop families having to sell their homes to pay for elderly relatives to be looked after. The Queen told MPs and peers that the government’s first priority is to strengthen Britain’s economic competitiveness.’ This includes building a stronger economy, rewarding people who work hard and tackling the deficit to keep interest rates low. The controversial High Speed Rail line linking London to Birmingham, and then Leeds and Manchester, will move a step closer with two Bills which will ‘provide further opportunities for economic growth in many of Britain’s cities’, the Queen said. The National Insurance costs for every company will be cut by £2,000, under plans first announced by George Osborne in the Budget. The move will mean 450,000 employers will pay no NI contributions at all. The government also promises to cut the burden of red tape, helping companies to grow and take on more staff. A Pensions Bill will create a flat-rate pension of around £140-a-week from 2016. Under the plan, years spent away from work looking after children or caring for elderly relatives will count towards a person’s final pension value. On crime and justice, there will be tougher action against anti-social behaviour, including scrapping the Asbo whole offender rehabilitation and new rules on controlling dangerous dogs. On defence there will be reform of the way the Ministry of Defence agrees multi-billion pound equipment deals.","Cameron under pressure to bring forward in-out referendum .

A team of government experts which tries to ‘nudge’ the public into changing their behaviour without them noticing is to be turned into a profit-making business. The Behavioural Insights Team will be spun out of Whitehall to become a John Lewis-style mutual, making money for employees, a private firm and the government. But fears were raised of a conflict of interest at the heart of government, with the new firm advising ministers while also bidding for contracts from companies who want to influence laws. End of the road: The move to transfer civil servants into private companies will signal the end of the traditional view of the Whitehall mandarin . The unit uses a mix of psychology, . advertising tricks and commons sense to coax people into losing weight, . paying court fines and having their lofts insulated. The move means the UK taxpayer could benefit from lucrative contracts advising other governments, companies and charities. But it raises the prospect of it advising ministers on public policy while being employed by private firms who want different things. John Trickett, Labour's shadow cabinet office minister, said: 'They are going to start bidding for non-government work. Immediately here is a question to be asked about a conflict of interest. 'What happens if they are nudging people into stopping smoking and then start bidding for work from people in the tobacco industry or pharmaceuticals. 'There are major issues about policy advice being done like this. I cannot see how they will be resolved. Policy advice should be neutral and disinterested.' The move could also pave the way for thousands of civil servants to be shifted into the private sector . In the past, governments have privatised state-run services like British Rail but today’s announcement marks the first time a group of policy experts have been hived off to become a company. The unit, run by former Labour adviser David Halpern, uses random tests and trials to see how small changes in policy can influence behaviour . The so-called Nudge Unit of around 10 . civil servants was created in 2010 to find ways to save money and . persuade the public to be healthier, greener and more law-abiding. Dismissed by some as a 'nutty indulgence', it claims to have raised millions of pounds by coaxing more people into paying tax and court fines on time. For example, when personalised texts were sent to people who owed court fines, payments rose by a third. The Behavioural Insights Team is separate from the Downing . Street Policy Unit which has attracted criticism this week after David . Cameron appointed a string of old school friends to his political inner . circle. The Prime Minister announced that Jo Johnson, the Old . Etonian brother of London Mayor Boris, is to head the policy unit. Mr Johnson will be joined by Christopher Lockwood, former U.S. editor of The . Economist magazine and a personal friend of the PM. The Nudge Unit has been dismissed as a 'nutty indulgence' by some in government, . But since its creation in 2010 it claims to have saved millions of pounds by using psychology to persuade people to pay fines, look for work or save energy. Ideas backed or highlighted by the Behavioral Insights Team include: . The nudge unit is staffed by civil servants, lead by psychologist David Halpern, who ran the Labour government’s strategy team. It currently costs £520,000-a-year to run, but ministers claim it has come up with ideas which have saved the taxpayer millions of pounds. It was set up in 2010 for two years. Under the plan, a private company will be sought to provide investment into the new company. The government will retain a stake and the staff of around 10 civil servants will become shareholders in the same way that employees at John Lewis receive bonuses based on company profits while they work there. It is expected that the staff will retain a share of at least a quarter in the company as a blocking minority stake, able to decide how the firm is run. A competition will be announced today to find a business partner for the nudge unit. The idea is being pushed by Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, who wants to massively increase the productivity of the public sector by giving staff a financial incentive. Mr Maude said: 'We are in a global race for the jobs and opportunities of the future. 'To get Britain back on the rise we must find innovative models like mutuals and joint ventures, which can deliver services better and more efficiently, while supporting growth in the economy. 'The Behavioural Insights Team is world-renowned and under a joint venture business model we will combine the benefits of private sector experience and investment with the innovation and commitment from staff leadership to develop a sustainable growth business.' Public sector productivity flat-lined from 1997 to 2010, he added. But unions said there was little appetite among civil servants to become mutuals. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'There is nothing mutual, co-operative or employee-led about what Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude is trying to do. 'The first mutual in the civil service was imposed by Maude's Government against a backdrop of strikes by the staff who wanted to remain as civil servants. 'Improving public services requires investment, not gimmicks and back-door privatisation.' But Matthew Fell, CBI Director for Competitive Markets, said: Turning the Nudge Unit into a profit-making enterprise through a joint venture partnership is an innovative way of commercialising Whitehall expertise. 'This will give the new enterprise the freedom to drive greater efficiency and to compete for new business, generating savings and potential new revenue for the Government. 'New delivery models, such as mutual joint ventures, offer real potential to transform public services by combining private sector knowledge and investment with employee ownership and leadership. The CBI believes there are many other functions across central and local government that could benefit from similar partnership models.'","Behavioural Insights Unit to become John-Lewis style firm .

Google is set to announce a second-generation Nexus tablet at an event next week with a higher resolution 7-inch screen and a 5MP rear-facing camera. Specifications and price details have been leaked ahead of the announcement that claim the device will sell for £150 ($229) for a 16GB model and £175 ($269) for the 32GB version. The device could also be the first to run Google's next operating system Android 4.3, which the company is also expected to launch on 24 July. Scroll down for video . Google is set to announce an updated Nexus tablet at an event next week with a higher resolution 7-inch screen and 5MP camera. Images, pictured, and details have been leaked by technology site Android Central ahead of the announcement that claim the device will sell for around £150 . It has been a year since Google launched its bargain tablet built by Asus, which was praised for its high-quality specifications and its low price of £159. Other 7-inch tablets including the iPad Mini cost around the £250 mark. Rumours about an updated model surfaced last month when a customer service representative from Asus - the company that makes the tablets for Google - apparently leaked the full specifications. Google then sent invitations to a press event scheduled for 24 July earlier this week. Android Central has since posted a video and pictures of what it expects is the next Nexus model. Screen: 7-inch . Resolution: 1280 x 800 . Camera: 1.2 MP front-facing camera . Operating system: Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) Processor: NVIDIA Tegra 3 quad-core processor . Memory: 1GB RAM . Battery:  4,325 mAh battery . Storage: 16GB and 32GB . Price: £159 (16GB), £199 (32GB) Screen: 7-inch . Resolution: 1980 x 1200 . Camera: 1.2 MP front-facing, 5MP rear-facing . Operating system: Android 4.3 . Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor . Memory: 2GB RAM . Battery:  4,325 mAh battery . Storage: 16GB and 32GB . Price: £150 (16GB), £175 (32GB) The images look very similar to the current tablet - they show an all-black design with the Asus and Nexus branding and the buttons in the same place as on the original tablet. The texture on the back of the device appears to have been removed. Specifications leaked by the Asus representative claimed the tablet will have a 5MP rear-facing camera, for the first time, as well as 1.2MP front-facing camera. Google was criticised following the launch of its first Nexus 7 for not including a rear-facing camera. At the time a spokesman was quoted as saying the company left the feature off because it didn't want to encourage people to use the device as a camera because it was too big. Analysts claimed Google and Asus might have excluded the device to keep costs down. A leaked rear-shot of what's thought to be the second-generation Nexus 7 show the textured cover has been removed. Google is also said to have added a 5MP rear-facing camera to the new device, pictured . The first Google Nexus 7 tablet by Asus was launched in June 2012. It was praised for its high-quality specifications and low price . The second-generation Nexus 7 is likely to have a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor, as seen in Google's Nexus 4 handset, alongside 2GB of RAM. The 7-inch screen, which gives the tablet its name, is set to remain but the resolution has been quoted as 1980x1200 with 1080p quality. It will run on Google's upcoming operating system, Android 4.3, and is rumoured as having a powerful 4,325mAh battery and support for 4G. It could also feature speakers at the top and bottom of the device. Official-looking paperwork posted by Engadget suggested the price of the next-generation gadget will be £150 ($229) for a 16GB version and £175 ($269) for a 32GB model. The price of the original Nexus 7 tablet is also expected to drop following the announcement.","Google set to announce a new Nexus tablet next week .

For many retired couples, paying the dreaded energy bill leaves little left-over at the end of the month. But pensioners Dan and Jane Fish have managed to slash their bill to an incredible £3 a month after researching the latest ways to cut their usage. A solar hot water system, a wood burner and solar panels have all helped the couple to cut their energy bills. The real Good Life: Dan and Jane Fish have spent thousands of pounds renovating their bungalow in a bid to achieve the ultimate 'carbon-neutral' green lifestyle . The greenest couple in Britain? The couple have a garden full of fruit and vegetables . Mr Fish, 77, started looking into ways to save money on their energy bills when he and his wife started having money problems 37 years ago. ‘It was a time of economic uncertainty in my industry,’ said Mr Fish, a semi-retired naval architect. ‘I was a hovercraft engineer and there didn’t seem like there was a future in it at that time. ‘We had three children, and I thought things would be quite bleak with all of us and little money.’ In a bid to save money, the couple renovated their bungalow in the New Forest to include a solar hot water system, a wood burner and solar panels which produce more electricity than they use. They also have a solar-powered car and grow their own fruit and vegetables - all their money-saving essentials have helped them reduce their bills to almost nothing. The only gas they use is for their stove, and their amazing bill of around £3 a month includes the annexe they rent out as a holiday home. Reminiscent of the TV series The Good Life, which hit the screens in 1975, the couple started their quest to become self-sufficient in the 1970s. Living off the land: Jane Fish chopping collected wood for the fire . Fuel for thought: The couple have a solar hot water system, and solar panels which produce more electricity than they use and a wood-burning stove . Wheels: The couple also have a solar-powered car which is powered by electricity produced by their solar panels . They decided to sell their home and buy a larger one in the New Forest where they could keep livestock and grow their own food. But now, their innovations are no longer about saving pounds but saving the planet, and are part of a whole green lifestyle. Dubbed ‘Britain’s greenest couple’, Mr and Mrs Fish never fly, and Mr Fish, even celebrated his 70th birthday with a cycling holiday from his home in Hampshire to Dundee, Scotland. Mr Fish said: ‘We went in for self-sufficiency in a big way.’ ‘We had a cow, pigs, chickens, sheep and grew masses of vegetables - it was hard work but great fun.’ Some of the self-sufficiency aspects have now gone - they found they didn’t have time to keep animals any longer. Although their initial motivation was to save money, as the couple learnt more about global warming they became increasingly concerned about their own impact on the environment. Mr Fish added: ‘The science is quite clear - for the world to halt climate change it needs a 100 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide by 2050.’ When he semi-retired around ten years ago the couple decided to step up their efforts to live a zero-carbon lifestyle. They estimate they are somewhere between 90 and 99 per cent carbon-free. Standing test of time: Their house is filled with inherited furniture - they still cook with pans that were a wedding present 55 years ago . Cheap and cheerful: The cosy home is almost completely powered by solar and green energy, including solar panels (pictured) Their house is filled with inherited furniture and items that have stood the test of time - they still cook with pans that were a wedding present 55 years ago. The Good Life: The couple have been likened to Tom and Barbara from the hit 1970s TV programme . On the couple’s decision to give up travelling by planes, Mrs Fish, 79, a retired music teacher, said: ‘We don’t want to feel we are killing people while we travel.’ ‘Our last flight was to see family in Canada about ten years ago - we came back by cargo ship. ‘The return journey took us a week and it was expensive - it cost about three times as much as flying - but it was lovely.’ Since then their holidays have involved travelling by ferry, train, bus, cargo ship and bicycle - which is how they got to the Greek island of Crete. The couple admit they are fortunate to be able to put their environmentally friendly methods in place, but hope to inspire others to reduce their carbon footprints. Admittedly some of their projects have incurred costs, while others have been time-consuming, but for Britain’s greenest couple that’s not what is important. Mr Fish added: ‘It gives one a nice feeling when you have a hot shower on a cold winter morning and know the water has been heated by the sun. ‘I claim that’s a completely different tingle!’","Dan and Jane Fish have been likened to Tom and Barbara from the 1970s BBC comedy The Good Life .

A council has come under fire after placing fines on gravestones because mourners' floral tributes breached regulations on pot plants. Several visitors to Alfreton Cemetery in Derbyshire found letters from Amber Valley Borough Council stating they had to pay for a garden permit because they had placed more than one pot plant at a gravestone. Rebecca Day, 37, was tending to her grandmother's grave when she discovered the A5 sized notice, which said she must pay £87 because she had more than the one pot plant allowed under council regulations. Shocked: Rebecca Day, 37, found a notice on her grandmother's grave, pictured at Alfreton Cemetery in Derbyshire, which told her she would have to buy a plant permit if she wanted more than one pot by the gravestone . Mrs Day, from Alfreton, Derbyshire, said: 'I can't stop crying. I felt sick. It's a special place and I feel it has been violated. 'I was so upset when I came across and found it on there. She lived in Alfreton all her life. I'm very angry - it's disgusting. 'I don't want it to look just like a bit of grass in a field. I shouldn't have to pay to keep it looking nice. Not everybody can afford to pay. 'The only thing we are allowed by the council, unless you pay £87 pounds, is a headstone and one pot plant. 'We already pay a fortune for the plot - I paid more than £700. Why should we have to pay again just for keeping it as a nice memorial?' The mother-of-two, whose grandmother Rhoda Vardy passed away in 2011 at the age of 79 following kidney problems, added: 'She would have been 81 today. Appalled: Rebecca Day pictured holding up the council notice workers left on her grandmother's grave . 'I just think it is wrong. I don't think there is any need. We've put our own topsoil on there. What is wrong with the graves looking like that? There's a lot of us that are quite angry. 'The council needs to be a little more thoughtful to us paying our respects.

Mrs Townsend, from South Normanton, . Derbyshire, said: 'I arrived to see my daughters grave and from the car . could see something had been left on the stone. 'I presumed it would be something . nice but as I walked over I saw it was a notice telling me the grave did . not comply with cemetery rules. Charge: Ms Day will have to pay the council £87 for permission to have more than one plant at her grandmother's grave at a time . 'I was completely devastated. Whoever put it there surely still has humanity. They could see my daughters face in the tributes.' Several mourners with family members buried at the cemetery are setting up a petition to call on the council to scrap the charge, which is enforced when families want to plant flowers and shrubs on graves. The fines started appearing on the graves last month. Simon Gladwin, assistant director of landscaping services at Amber Valley Borough Council, said plots at Alfreton cemetery cost £525, with garden permits costing £52 or £87 depending on the plot size. He added: 'The fee is levied as when someone puts a garden it makes it more difficult for the area to be maintained, and it increases the council's maintenance costs so it is a one off fee that we charge. 'You can't simply mow up and down rows when there are gardens there. 'The notice is relatively discreet. It is only an A5 notice saying the garden does not comply with standards and to call the officer to discuss it further.'

Actor Peter Fonda is suing designers Dolce & Gabbana and retail chain Nordstrom for $3million over a t-shirt with his face on it. The 73-year-old star filed legal proceedings against the firms claiming they have been illegally selling garments bearing his image without his permission. The t-shirt in question is printed with a picture of Fonda as biker Wyatt in the iconic 1969 movie Easy Rider. Lawsuit: The t-shirt, seen left, which is printed with the image of Peter Fonda in the 1969 film Easy Rider, has prompted the actor, seen right, to launch legal proceedings against D&G and retailer Nordstrom . The law suit filed by Fonda's lawyer in Los Angeles last week claims Italian fashion design duo Dolce & Gabbana 'knowingly manufactured, distributed and sold, or licensed for sale' t-shirts with his image on without his permission. Nordstrom is listed in the suit for allegedly selling the t-shirts, according to a report on thewrap.com. 'At no time did Defendants seek permission from Plaintiff to use his name, likeness and image for commercial purposes on the T-Shirts or any other apparel that Defendants intended to or did manufacture, license, sell, distribute or advertise in any known media,' the lawsuit reads. He is seeking financial compensation 'in an amount not less than' £3million. Dolce & Gabbana declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline today. Controversy: Legal proceedings against the design duo come after they temporarily closed their Milan stores in protest at being 'pilloried' over their tax evasion convictions . Iconic scene: Fonda is seeking at least £3million in compensation for the use of the image taken from the 1969 biker movie . Nordstrom has said it is aware of the issue and is 'reaching out to our vendor to determine next steps'. The lawsuit throws Dolce & Gabbana into the spotlight once again, after they closed their Milan stores last week in protest at being 'pilloried' over their tax evasion convictions. Signs reading 'closed for indignation' were pinned up in the windows of the designers' shops in Milan, the city where the pair showed their first collection in 1985. Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were given 20-month jail terms for evading taxes on royalties of around a billion euros (£860million) by selling their brand to a Luxembourg-based holding company in 2004. Passersby looking into the closed Dolce & Gabbana shops in Milan today, where the signs read 'closed for indignation' Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana are furious over 'attacks from public ministers and the media pillory' over their tax eviction convictions, they said . They are not yet wearing prison stripes, as, under the Italian justice system, anyone found guilty of a crime is automatically granted at least two appeals. However, Milan’s city administration said the pair, who count Kylie Minogue and Kate Moss among their celebrity fans, would no longer be able to use any public spaces for their shows as they were bad for the city’s image. Commercial director Franco D’Alfonso said: ‘Any time designers Dolce and Gabbana submit requests for public space, the council must keep the doors closed to them. ‘Their fashion is seen as excellent the world over, but we do not need tax evaders to promote us.’ The designers are hitting back at Milan council after a city councillor said the duo not be allowed to show their collections in Milan's communal spaces after their convictions . The designers afterwards reacted with rage. In a furious tweet Stefano Gabbana wrote: ‘Milan council: You’re disgusting!!!’ And today its Milan stores, Martini bar and restaurant, Gold, were shut in protest, exhibiting signs in the windows saying ‘Closed in indignation’, in both English and Italian. 'We are no longer willing to suffer undeservedly the accusations of the financial police and the income revenue authority, attacks from public ministers and the media pillory we have already been subjected to for years,' they said in a statement. The pair said they would continue to pay their more than 250 employees in Milan during the temporary closure of all their nine shops in the city. The conviction follows an investigation that began in 2008 as part of a tax-avoidance crackdown amid the eurozone crisis. The two founders of the iconic . fashion house, with six others, evaded taxes for several years after . setting up a front company in Luxembourg. The . creators of the world-famous Dolce & Gabbana brand who are expected . to appeal, were also ordered to pay compensation to Italy’s tax . authorities. Dolce & Gabbana will appeal their sentences and the company appears to conducting business as usual, with an advert featuring Matthew McConaughey and Scarlett Johansson being filmed earlier this month . When the charges were first made public, Stefano Gabbana condemned the Italian tax authorities as ‘thieves’, and threatened to leave the country. Tax evasion is thought to cost Italy €200billion (£170billion) a year. Several cases involving celebrities have led to out-of-court settlements; in 2000 opera singer Luciano Pavarotti paid 24billion lira (£8million) in back taxes, while MOTOGP champion Valentino Rossi agreed to hand over €39million (£33million) in 2008.","Claims D&G and retail chain illegally peddling garment bearing his image .

Campaign trail: Eliot Spitzer is currently campaigning to become New York City controller, but his mistakes as state governor continue to haunt him . ‘Please inform whoever the [overnight shift] is that they should not be hanging around in the governor’s hallway,’ former State Police Capt. Lisa Galbraith wrote in one message to Spitzer’s tax-payer funded minders, reveals the Times Union. The directive was part of materials gathered by then-Attorney General Andrew Cuomo during a 2008 State Police investigation and recently made . available under a Freedom of Information Law request. The files show that Cuomo’s . investigation not only examined whether the State Police had engaged in . political espionage, but also how a sitting governor was able to have so many . undetected encounters with prostitutes, while supposedly under their guard. In one interview, Galbraith told investigators that Spitzer was also known for trying to 'sneak out' at night to evade the ESD (Executive Service Detail) members. During his time as attorney general and state governor Eliot Spitzer was known for evading his security detail during overnight trips to meet with prostitutes . Loughran, who retired last year, also told investigators about an undated incident when Spitzer, as governor, was followed to a Manhattan hotel by a trooper assigned to protect him. In February 2008, Galbraith said, she was notified by a trooper that Spitzer had left his Washington, DC, hotel room. That same week, according to federal authorities, Spitzer paid $4,300 to a prostitute who came to his hotel in Washington. Spitzer has disputed the report. 'Eliot says that he never told anyone at the State Police how to do their job,' spokeswoman Lisa Linden told the New York Post. Spitzer has also admitted in a new campaign ad released on Monday that he failed as governor due to his infidelities. ‘Look, I failed. Big time. I hurt a lot of people,’ said Spitzer in the commercial. Spitzer released a new campaign ad on Monday in which he admitted that he had failed as state governor due to his infidelities . ‘When you dig yourself a hole, you can either lie in it the rest of your life, or do something positive. That’s why I’m running.’ Spitzer also insinuated that negative attacks over his return to politics are being orchestrated by the large companies who he made his reputation battling against, rather than average people who might not be willing to forgive him for soliciting prostitutes. 'If you hear any negative noise out there, and you will, keep in mind where it’s coming from,' he said. 'Maybe being hated by the Wall Street firms isn’t such a terrible thing.' A spokesperson for Scott Stringer, his rival for the controller position, told New York magazine: 'Eliot Spitzer's real failure was a governorship that left Albany more broken than when he arrived. 'It's clearer and clearer that for Eliot Spitzer, this campaign is not about the needs and struggles of New York's middle class – it's all about Eliot Spitzer.' In his latest campaign ad, Spitzer insinuates that negative attacks against him are being orchestrated by the large companies, rather than average people who might not be willing to forgive him for soliciting prostitutes .","New report reveals Spitzer was well known for evading his security detail during overnight trips .

Former partner and star witness in the trial of James 'Whitey' Bulger today accused the reputed gangster of being a pedophile. Stephen 'The Rifleman' Flemmi had acknowledged in testimony that he engaged in oral sex with his longtime girlfriend's teenage daughter, Deborah Hussey, who had called him 'Daddy' but lobbed the accusations back on Whitey when testifying today. Flemmi also testified that Bulger strangled Hussey after she started using drugs, getting arrested and dropping their names when she got in trouble. Stephen 'The Rifleman' Flemmi, (pictured left in 1974 and right in 2008), the former partner of reputed gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger, says he watched as Bulger strangled Flemmi's stepdaughter, a woman who had called him 'Daddy' since she was a toddler . Flemmi said Bulger killed Deborah Hussey (pictured) because she was using drugs, getting arrested and dropping their names when she got in trouble . But Bulger's lawyer Hank Brennan . pressed Flemmi on his assertion and suggested that Flemmi, not Bulger, . killed Hussey after she told her mother he molested her. Flemmi didn't want to be seen as a pedophile, Brennan said. But Flemmi said that if Brennan . wanted to talk about pedophilia, 'right over there at that table,' gesturing toward where Bulger was seated. Bulger glanced at Flemmi but did not . visibly react. Flemmi had told jurors earlier that Bulger once took a . 16-year-old girl to Mexico with him. He did not say when that was. Flemmi was in his fourth day testifying against the reputed Boston crime boss at Bulger's racketeering trial. Bulger, 83, is accused of participating in 19 killings during the 1970s and '80s while leading the notorious Winter Hill Gang. He fled Boston in 1994 and was one of the nation's most-wanted fugitives until he was captured in California two years ago. Flemmi, 79, has pleaded guilty to 10 murders and is serving a life sentence.

Former mob boss and fugitive James 'Whitey' Bulger, who was arrested in Santa Monica, California on June 22, 2011, is accused of participating in 19 killings during the 1970s and `80s while leading the notorious Winter Hill Gang . Testifying Monday, Flemmi acknowledged that he twice had oral sex with Hussey in what he called 'a moment of weakness'. Flemmi said Hussey's mother, Marion, . had been his live-in girlfriend since Hussey was just a toddler and that . she had called him 'Daddy' from a young age. 'A girl who called you 'Daddy' consented to sex with you?' Brennan asked. Flemmi said the sexual contact took place when Hussey became 'a different person' because of 'her demeanor, her lifestyle.' He said she had been frequenting Boston's Combat Zone, then a center of drugs and prostitution. Neither Brennan nor Flemmi specified how old Hussey was at the time. She was 26 when she was killed in 1985. Turning his testimony to her death, Flemmi said he reluctantly agreed to bring Hussey to a home in South Boston. 'Jim Bulger stepped out from behind . the top of the basement stairs and grabbed her by the throat and started . strangling her,' Flemmi said. 'He lost his balance and they both fell on the floor, and he continued strangling her.' When Bulger attorney Hank Brennan . initially asked Flemmi about whether he had a sexual relationship with . Hussey, Flemmi asked him to clarify whether he was talking about . intercourse or oral sex. He then acknowledged having oral sex with her . twice. 'I . never inflicted any abuse on her; that was consensual,' Flemmi said, . prompting murmurs from family members of some of Bulger's alleged . victims in the courtroom. Tommy Donahue, son of alleged murder victim Michael Donahue, reacts while speaking with reporters outside U.S. District Court in Boston Monday. Flemmi said Bulger bragged about killing Donahue and another man . Hussey was one of three people who were buried in the same house after Bulger killed them, Weeks testified previously. He said he helped move the bodies later when the house was being sold. In 2000, after he began cooperating with the government, he led authorities to the bodies. Flemmi also testified on Monday that Bulger had boasted of a 1982 drive-by shooting in which he killed a mobster that he learned was an FBI informant. 'He had good firepower in the car and he was driving,' Flemmi said of the shooting in which Bulger killed Brian Halloran, the FBI informant, and another man, Michael Donahue. 'He leaned over and he fired from the passenger side and hit Donahue, killed Donahue,' Flemmi said. Bulger then shot Halloran as he tried to flee, Flemmi said. Bulger bragged about the killings during a meeting at Flemmi's mother's house, according to the testimony.","Stephen Flemmi, .

The owner and manager of a rat and reptile breeding operation were arrested Friday after rescue crews last year entered the breeding facility and encountered a sight so revolting that they needed crisis counselors to cope. Following a tip-off in 2012, a PETA investigator worked undercover at Global Captive Breeders, a company that raised rats and snakes to be sold at pet stores and swap meets in Lake Elsinore, California. The investigator reported that some of the company's workers, including its manager, neglected thousands of animals, many of them to death, and cruelly killed countless more. The owner, Mitchell Behm, 54, and manager, David Delgado, also known as Jose Magana, 29, have been arrested and charged with more than 100 counts each of felony animal cruelty for the way they treated the 18,400 rats and 600 reptiles rescuers found in the warehouse. Cruelty: This weak and lethargic rat was found in a tub with at least 200 other juvenile rats, many of whom were severely dehydrated and dying . Inhumane: (left) David Delgado, 29, the former manager of Global Captive Breeders and (right) Mitchell Behm, 54, the owner of the business . Many of the animal workers . came out gasping for air and sickened by the heinous sights and smells, . including a mixture of death, disease, decay and ammonia from . accumulated urine and feces in rat bins. Officials with the People for . the Ethical Treatment of Animals called it the largest-ever seizure of . animals in California. The Riverside County district attorney filed the case Friday. A message left for Behm's attorney was not immediately returned, and a lawyer for Delgado could not be located.The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals initiated the investigation after sending an undercover operative to work at the breeding facility in Lake Elsinore, 70 miles south-east of Los Angeles, for two months in 2012. Starved: This monitor lizard was emaciated with plainly visible vertebrae, and was missing skin from the white areas on his or her nose and back . Fear factory: Rescue crews found scenes of neglect and despair in this unassuming warehouse in Lake Elsinore which reeked of the rotting corpses of rats and reptiles . People were throwing up because of the ammonia fumes and 'there were times you had to run outside just to catch a breath of fresh air,' she said. People emotionally broke down and had to be excused. Several people ended up with colds and sore throats. 'I lost my voice,' she said. 'I had some idea what to expect but little could have prepared me for the overwhelming stench of death and decay you could smell from the outside of the facility. On the inside it was overpowering,' said Daphna Nachminovitch, senior vice president of cruelty investigations for PETA. There were 18,400 feeder rats and over 600 snakes, black tree monitors, tokay geckos and sulcata tortoises, Nachminovitch said. Most of the rats were without food in overcrowded bins and because of a faulty water system, were either drowning or dying of thirst. 'Some were literally eating each other alive,' she said. Willa Bagwell, executive director at . Animal Friends, was involved in the investigation since it began and . described the scene and smell at the 3rd Street facility as 'horrific.' 'We . had animals that had been dead for weeks with maggots crawling out of . them,' she said. 'There was terrible suffering in unimaginable . conditions.' Mitch . Behm got a conditional use permit for the business in 2009, said Justin . Carlson, a spokesman for Lake Elsinore. The city received one anonymous . complaint about the business before PETA stepped in, Carlson said. Death and decay: Animal welfare workers described the scene and smell at Global Captive Breeders as 'horrific', with flooding enclosures drowning rats while others died of thirst . A whistleblower contacted PETA and the animal welfare agency sent an undercover investigator to get a job at the business. The investigator documented rats being grabbed by their tails and slammed against poles, stomped on, shot with a BB gun, frozen alive and drowned. Nachminovitch said that the two months PETA's investigator spent at Global Captive Breeders was needed to document enough photo and video evidence to obtain a search warrant. In addition, the neglect was so far advanced by the time the whistleblower called that it would have been impossible to save the animals.The 6,100-square-foot warehouse had separate entrances to the reptile and rat rooms, but the snakes didn't fare any better than the rats, Nachminovitch said. Some of the boas and pythons were 15-feet long. The animals were euthanized in the warehouse and taken to a rendering plant, she said. Every rescue worker sets out to save animals, Machado said. But there is also satisfaction in giving an animal in pain a humane, peaceful passing, she said. 'I have been with PETA for 15 years and there was an unprecedented amount of active suffering while we were standing there. I am grateful we could end it,' Nachminovitch said.","Animal rescue crews encountered horrific scenes of cruelty and neglect at the California facility .

The police officer who last week released graphic photographs of the Boston bomber as he was apprehended has met with Jeff Bauman, the 27-year-old who lost both legs in the blast. The informal meeting, in which the men chatted over lunch as Bauman showed off his new prosthetic legs, came as the officer, Sgt Sean Murphy, was placed on desk duty until an investigation into his conduct is completed. Bauman's appearance beside Murphy adds to the growing support for the beleaguered officer, who has been called a hero for standing up for the victims of the bombings. The tactical photographer was suspended for a day from the Massachusetts State Police after releasing 14 photographs of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as he was caught on April 19, even though he was not authorized to do so. Murphy said that he released the graphic images to Boston Magazine after he became so enraged at how Rolling Stone magazine had depicted Tsarnaev as a rock star by putting him on its cover. On Tuesday, there was a closed hearing to . determine his future in the job and he was placed on restricted duty. He will now be on desk duty - where he will have no contact with the public - until an investigation is completed. Jeff Bauman . was with a Boston Herald writer in Maine at the weekend when they heard Murphy was in . the area and invited him over to meet the bombing victim. 'Minutes later, [he] was at the door,' Gerry Callahan explained in an article for the paper. 'All he wanted to know was how Bauman was doing.'

Outcry: Murphy released the images of Boston bombing suspect . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev being captured, left, in response to the Rolling Stone magazine . cover, right, that depicted him as a rock star . Despite being branded a hero by those . affected by the bombings, Murphy's future in the police department is . uncertain after he released the images without their approval. He argued that the music magazine had glamorized terrorism and dismissed the victims and their families by running a picture Tsarnaev, who turned 20 last week, had taken of himself. Murphy said that his images, which he took as Tsarnaev was apprehended, showed the . true face of terrorism, but he was reprimanded for releasing them . without authorization and suspended. After he was suspended, he received the backing of the families of MIT police officer Sean . Collier, who was allegedly shot dead by the Tsarnaev brothers in the aftermath of the April 15 attacks. Angry: Sgt Sean Murphy said he was so incensed by what he saw as the glamorization of Tsarnaev by Rolling Stone magazine, that he released these graphic photos of the night he was apprehended . Caught: Tsarnaev, then 19, was found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard in Watertown on April 15 . The family slammed Rolling Stone for 'portraying the . face of evil' and called for the Massachusetts State Police . officer to be reinstated. A . statement, printed by Boston Magazine, read: 'We, the family of slain . MIT police officer, Sean Collier, were fortunate to get to know Sgt Sean . Murphy in the days following Sean’s death. 'Sgt.

'With . the help of Sgt Murphy, his fellow state police, and the officers of . the MIT Police Department, our family was able to get through those dark . days. 'Terrorists are not rock stars and they . should not be rewarded with fame and magazine covers. The real heroes . are the law enforcement officers, first responders, and victims of this . terror.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:11 EST, 10 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:11 EST, 10 May 2012 . The tables have turned in U.S. divorce courts with more women paying their former husbands alimony and child support than ever before, according to U.S. lawyers. As women climb higher up the career ladder and outpace their exes in salary, when love goes wrong and marriages break up they are being compelled to contribute to the livelihood of their former spouses. And some are not happy about it. More and more women are finding that having broken the glass ceiling with their wages they are having to pay alimony and child support if the marriage ends . More than half, 56 percent, of divorce lawyers across the United States have seen an increase in mothers paying child support in the last three years and 47 percent have noted a hike in the number of women paying alimony, according to the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. 'It shows that women have really moved up financially and that in many instances they are the major bread winners in a lot of families,' said Alton Abramowitz, the president-elect of the academy. 'The glass ceiling has been pierced and more and more women have taken over the financial responsibilities and have been saddled with them as well. 'It is a fact of the way our society has evolved over the last number of years.' Happier times: Michael Covey, left, and Susan Decker appear together in this photo taken in 2007 - the same year the couple filed for divorce . Recent examples such as the case of ex-Yahoo boss Susan Decker, 49, who reached a settlement with her husband Michael Dovey to the tune of $71 million prove this point. He stopped work when he was in his 30's as his former wife's career was in the ascendancy. With three children aged between five and fifteen the divorce proceedings between the pair were bitter, but the key detail to emerge from the battle was that Decker was responsible for the family finances and obsessed over 'every penny'. And to prove this is a growing phenomenon and not an instant change, there is the case of actress Anne Heche. As the principle bread winner in her marriage to Coley Laffoon, Anne Heche had to pay him alimony and child support payments to him and the child they had together . Three years ago she reached a divorce settlement with her husband Coley Laffoon which included monthly child support payments to Laffoon for their son. Abramowitz, who has been practicing law for 39 years, described the findings of the survey and the changed role of women in the workforce as a sea change. In his graduating law school class of 135, there were just six women. Data from the Digest of Education Statistics show that the number of men and women receiving medical degrees in the U.S. is almost equal, unlike 1980 when only about a third of medical degrees were awarded to women. The number of women getting law degrees has nearly doubled. 'You are seeing the results of that, the impact, now in terms of the professions,' Abramowitz said. 56 percent, of divorce lawyers across the United States have seen an increase in mothers paying child support in the last three years and 47 percent have noted a hike in the number of women paying alimony . Although women have made strides professionally, the divorce rate in the United States has remained fairly constant. About half of marriages in the United States end in divorce. The rate has hovered between 46 and 53 percent for decades, he added. Just as many men grumbled about paying alimony to their former wives, women are not pleased with the turnaround. 'We see women who are every bit as angry as their male counterparts, maybe more so, when they are confronted with the concept of paying spousal support to a man,' said Abramowitz. Although women have made strides professionally, the divorce rate in the United States has remained fairly constant. About half of marriages in the United States end in divorce . The gender switch in alimony payments is just one of many changes he has seen during his four decades as a lawyer. 'When I started practicing in 1973 there was no equitable distribution of property,' he said . The 1,600 members of the Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers handle separations, prenuptial agreements, custody battles, property evaluation and division, the rights of unmarried couples, as well as divorce and child support.","56 percent, of divorce lawyers across .

But speculation was mounting yesterday as to whether Sunday night’s bright full moon had triggered the duchess’s first contractions. While most will say nature had simply run its course, some believe the theory that suggests the moon’s gravitational pull can influence embryonic fluid around a child in the womb in much the same way as it affects the tide. Mother nature: Theories as to what kick-started the Duchess of Cambridge's labour include the lunar cycle and the weather . Mervi Jokinen, of the Royal College of Midwives, said colleagues often talk of how a full moon makes for a busy spate of deliveries. While she acknowledged any evidence was purely anecdotal, she said: ‘Midwives usually do say “I’m on call. It’s a full moon. I’ll be busy tonight”.’ She added: ‘There was a study about 20 years ago at a hospital near the Thames which is a tidal river, it showed that on the full moon they did have more births. ‘The idea is that because the baby is surrounded by water, the time of the full moon and the high tide causes the waters to break.’ Filling time: As the world's media camped outside the Lindo wing at St. Mary's Hospital, news broke that the Duchess of Cambridge has gone into labour in the early hours of Monday morning . Facts and figures: Royal aide Ed Perkins delivers information on when the Royal baby was born. He is a Cancerian like Prince William with a moon in Capricorn - the same star-sign as mother Kate . Some experts say because the human body is comprised of 80 per cent water, there is no reason to discount the suggestions. It is also thought menstrual cycles are similarly influenced. And it was not the only natural phenomenon being credited with encouraging the duchess’s labour yesterday. Some believe an electrical storm above Kensington Palace may also have had an effect, with thunder and lightning and isolated showers in West London at 6am yesterday. Old Wives' Tales: Some believe that the moon's gravitational pull can affect the embryonic fluid around an unborn child and bring on contractions . Pat Wood, a midwife of 20 years said: ‘There’s a pressure around the baby in the uterus. There’s change from a high atmosphere to a suddenly low one when a storm comes and the difference in pressure is what the uterus is trying to equal, so your waters can break. Conceding the theory was ‘anecdotal’, she added: ‘It’s only a tipping point but if it’s your ‘maybe, maybe not day’ – it might be the final straw that does it.’","Theory that Sunday night's bright, full moon kick-started Duchess of Cambridge's labour .

"By . Zoe Brennan . PUBLISHED: . 19:07 EST, 1 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:38 EST, 2 May 2013 . Mary Kerswell was taken away in handcuffs after she refused to leave without her medical notes . Normally mild-mannered and calm, Mary Kerswell found herself becoming unusually angry with the receptionist at her doctor’s surgery. For the 67-year-old grandmother and retired biomedical scientist had been asked by her GP to take a urine test to monitor a kidney condition she did not have. Bewildered, she asked to have a copy of her medical notes, for which she paid £10. She was told to come back a week later to collect them. She did, yet when she arrived at the practice last December to find the notes were still not ready, Mary refused to leave without them and staged a sit-down protest in the waiting room. Astonishingly, the surgery called the police and Mary was taken away in handcuffs. When Mary did get hold of her notes later that month, the apparent reason for the doctor’s reluctance to release them quickly was clear — they were littered with errors. As well as being wrongly recorded as having chronic kidney disease, the healthy pensioner was said to be a heavy smoker who suffered from Alzheimer’s. The record also claimed incorrectly that she had undergone a hysterectomy and a double hip replacement. ‘I was utterly shocked,’ says Mary. ‘It read like a post-mortem, it really did. They must have been the entries for someone else. ‘It could have been really dangerous. Who knows what implications these errors could have had if I’d been taken to hospital in an emergency?’ Mary’s doctor said the mistakes were caused by a ‘filing error’. But, alarmingly, there are concerns that errors on medical notes are not always accidental. Indeed, there are fears that some GPs are fabricating medical records to reap financial rewards. If GPs meet targets for monitoring conditions such as asthma and diabetes, they get extra funds — but for these to be made available, naturally some of their patients need to have the conditions in question. The organisation Patients Know Best found that one third of medical records contained errors.And Joyce Robins, a spokeswoman for the health service users’ group Patient Concern, highlights several cases. Organisation Patients Know Best found that one third of medical records contained errors . One man went to see his doctor suffering from stress because he was being stalked by a woman, who was later convicted of the offence. Some years later, he found that his notes said he was suffering from ‘paranoid delusions’ that he had a stalker. Ms Robins says: ‘This gentleman has been labelled a fruitcake for ever. He has been unable to get it removed from his records. He should be able to get an annotation on his notes at least, but he can’t. It is an extraordinary state of affairs.’ Another woman, struggling with bloating and lethargy, was called a ‘malingerer’ in her notes. The wheat allergy found to have caused her ‘fusspot’ symptoms was diagnosed only when her records were lost. Another man found that his records erroneously stated he suffered from heart disease. When he told his GP that this was incorrect, the doctor answered: ‘Can you prove it?’ In fact the patient  happened to be chief executive of one of London’s major hospitals, so he was more than able to correct his GP. But others are not so lucky. Recent cases also abound on the internet. On a parenting blog, one mother writes: ‘My doctor casually mentioned my son’s epilepsy during a consultation last year. My son does not have epilepsy.’ Another woman glanced at her doctor’s screen and was ‘gobsmacked’ to see ‘elephantiasis’ — which is caused by tropical parasites — listed as a current condition. ‘My legs are a bit chunky but I doubt they would qualify for this ailment,’ she says. ‘Clearly there has been a mistake, but am unsure about challenging the doctors.’ Fears about the consequences of challenging GPs about their notes are not unfounded. In Mary’s case, she has been struck off the patient list by her local health centre, having been labelled a ‘problem patient’. Ms Robins insists that this is not an uncommon occurrence. ‘It’s so difficult,’ she says. ‘People say: “I daren’t ask for my notes because I’ll be struck off.” We can’t tell them that this won’t happen because it does.’ Patient Concern wants to see an end to ‘cradle-to-grave’ notes that patients cannot correct. ‘If something is wrong it is round your neck for ever,’ says Ms Robins. ‘It is estimated that 40 per cent of doctors’ notes are inaccurate. These errors could be life-threatening. Yet doctors just don’t like to admit they are wrong.’ She wants easier access to notes and a system whereby errors can be corrected — especially as the national computerisation of medical notes, which has been taking place over the past few years, has led to further mistakes creeping in as records are transferred from paper to computer. Theoretically, patients have the right to see their medical records under the Data Protection Act 1998. The request can be refused only if it would cause serious harm to the patient’s mental health.However, some doctors are still against patients having access to their notes, arguing that it restricts what they feel able to write. Even if patients do manage to see their notes, they can face a struggle to have  inaccuracies corrected. Helen Wilkinson campaigns against the NHS Care Records System after she noticed on her records that she had been labelled an alcoholic . Take the horrifying case of Helen Wilkinson. Browsing through her NHS records in 2004, the local councillor and former NHS manager from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, was confronted with an entry labelling her an alcoholic. ‘I went ballistic,’ she says. ‘I have lived locally for a long time and know a lot of people who work in the NHS. They could all have seen it. It was awful.’ Helen had gone into hospital for a surgical procedure when she found that the error dating back to 1988 had been added to her computerised records. She was able to amend her records after a two-year battle, during which her MP raised her case in Parliament. Helen, 47, now campaigns for The Big Opt Out, a group that opposes the NHS Care Records System — the vast computer network which was introduced in 2010 and holds information electronically. But this has left her vulnerable.‘I can’t access NHS care, just because I don’t want my data stored in this way,’ she says. ‘I have been removed from NHS databases and don’t even have an NHS number. ‘I’m only able to access treatment when I’m ill because medical colleagues treat me as a favour. Nine years later, I still can’t access care.’ The case of Jo Walsh, a 40-year-old PR consultant, is equally disturbing. She went to see the nurse for a routine matter and saw her notes over the nurse’s shoulder. Astonished, she realised that a doctor had made false and unpleasant references to her mental health after she complained that he had cut one of her appointments short. Outraged, she asked to see a full copy of her records. Jo, who lives in London, had gone to see the doctor because she was suffering from extreme bruising, perhaps connected to a dietary deficiency. She says: ‘The references made in my notes were to depression, bipolar disorder, hypomania, drug abuse and psychosis. The doctor made me look like a nutter. ‘This was all inferred from a meeting that was so rushed I couldn’t even explain all my symptoms, and that ended with him pretty much pushing me out of the door. I reckon it lasted around five minutes. ‘I was so upset afterwards that I went straight to reception and complained that the doctor had been really rude. But it was only later that I found out what he had written in my records.’ After Jo alerted the surgery to these errors, she was told that the notes were the  result of a ‘bad day for the doctor’. However, much to Jo’s distress, any information on medical records cannot be removed from the system, only added to. The Patient Association explains: ‘Medical records cannot usually be changed because they are supposed to show what was written at the relevant time. However, a note can be added to your records explaining why you think they are incorrect and giving the correct version of events.’ Jo is understandably concerned that these erroneous claims are now irrevocably on her record. She is considering legal action. Dr Mohammad Al-Ubaydli, the founder of Patients Know Best, wants to see a new system where patients are in charge of their own notes and bring them to appointments. ‘A doctor should ask a patient for his or her notes,’ he says. ‘Medical notes are full of errors. 'They continue to accumulate if patients never see their records. Some are going to be dangerous. It is the patient and their family who have the biggest interest in their records. The patient and doctor should help each other, rather than trying to cover up errors. Then we could avoid all this silliness.’ This would also stop GPs altering patients’ notes to gain more funding from the Government.Dr Al-Ubaydli adds: ‘If you look at U.S. research, we know that data gets shaped differently when there are financial concerns. Does that happen in the UK? Draw your own conclusions.’ Indeed, GPs in the UK earn around £1 billion a year from bonuses. About a quarter of their average income is linked to achieving government targets. Whatever the reasons for these errors, they are deeply worrying and seem unlikely to improve in the foreseeable future, despite complaints from numerous patients. As Ms Robins reflects: ‘We have sat on Department of Health committees on this and nothing is done. After all, GPs are very powerful people.’","If GPs meet targets for monitoring conditions they get extra funds .

Four British men, including a retired judge, are being extradited to Italy to face Mafia money laundering charges. Colin Dines, 68, his son Andrew, 31, and their colleagues Andrew Neave, 44, and Paul O’Connor, 41 are accused of using companies they run to launder Mafia money. They intend to plead not guilty, insisting they are completely innocent - but face spending 18 months in jail with hardened criminals before their case even comes to trial. The men are being extradited under a controversial European Arrest Warrent (EAW) system that allows foreign authorities to demand suspects without providing any evidence against them. Retired judge Colin Dines, centre, with his son Andrew and wife Sarah. The two men are being extradited to Italy on Mafia money laundering charges . The case is the latest in a string of controversial extraditions enforced using EAW’s. which were introduced in 2002 by the EU, following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The warrants were intended as a means to deal with terror suspects in other countries, but critics claim they are being abused to arrest and extradite people accused of far lesser offences, many of whom are innocent. Parliamentary figures back up the suggestion, revealing Britain surrenders 11 people under EAWs for every one brought to the UK - prompting Conservative MP Dominic Raab to campaign against the unfair use of the warrants. Mr Neave was put on an flight from Heathrow to Rome on Friday. The other three men are expected to join him over the coming days - including Mr Dines snr, a former . criminal barrister, who spent eight years as a judge in courts across . London and the South East - . They will then be held at Rebibbia prison on the outskirts of the capital, where they face a wait of a year and a half before they get the chance to prove their innocence in court. The four men are alleged to be involved in a £344 million money laundering scheme, through London-based commodity brokerage and telecoms firms companies they run. It’s claimed the companies engaged in carousel VAT fraud in Italy - acting as ‘fictitious clients so that money generated by the fraud was laundered through the companies’ accounts.’ They were arrested in February 2010 in a raid on their homes by officers from the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca) armed with European Arrest Warrents issued by a magistrate in Italy. Incarcerated: The four men face spending 18 months in Rome's Rebibbia Prison before their case even comes to trial . Their assets were frozen and restraining orders were placed on their homes, to stop them from being sold. The men, who have nine children between them, are particularly concerned about the fate of their families - who have only been able to draw £300 a week from their frozen assets . They fought extradition but lost that battle in January 2011, when Westminster magistrates ruled they should travel to Italy to face trial for involvement in what an Italian judge described as a ‘transnational criminal organisation consisting of more than 10 people' and 'complicit in money laundering.’ They appealed and appeared at the High Court in February before Lord Justice Hooper, a former colleague of Mr Dines', who denied the appeal, insisting there was sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation. Last ditch approaches to the European Court of Human Rights and Home Secretary Theresa May failed and the extradition is going ahead - despite the fact the men claim they have never been charged or shown any evidence against them. Mr Dines snr, from Slapton, Devon, told the Telegraph: ‘We were dragged out of bed at 5am, yet we’ve never been questioned by the prosecutors in the case. We have never been charged or shown details of the case against us. As a result we have not been able to put up any defence.’ Speaking before his extradition, he added: ‘We have conducted our business dealings with the Italian companies impeccably, but the investigating magistrate looking into them on another matter came across our names on a number of documents. As a result, instead of coming over here and talking to us about it, he has sought a warrant for our arrest. ‘We will be thrown into Rome’s worst prison for what our Italian lawyers say could be up to six months before being charged and another year of pretrial detention. Italy has the worst legal system in Europe, where the standard practice is to threaten and induce detainees in order to obtain admission of guilt in exchange for a reduced sentence. It’s worse than plea bargaining, because we are going to be locked up in a foreign country without access to proper legal representation, no bail and our assets frozen.'","Four men are being extradited under controversial European Arrest Warrant .

The body of a creative socialite, known for her eye-catching jewellery and eccentric outfits, has been discovered in her Nevada apartment several weeks after she died. Amber Bently's body was found on Friday after an official, who had arrived at the apartment building to serve an eviction notice, raised the alarm. The 34-year-old estranged wife of property businessman Christopher Bently, had not been reported missing, but the sheriff's office said there was no evidence of foul play. Loss: Amber Bently with her husband Christopher. The socialite was living alone at the time of her death . A cause of death has not yet been determined and the results of a toxicology test could take up to eight weeks to arrive. Douglas County Sheriff's office said Mrs .

Mrs Bently, who had separated from her husband last year after being married for about ten years, was well known for her parties and the couple's building renovations in San Francisco. The couple, who supported environmental charities, also supported the Burning Man arts festival, which is held in Nevada's Black Rock Desert, near Reno. After they separated last year Mrs Bently swapped their Nob Hill penthouse and Stinson Beach home for a place in Sausalito before moving to an apartment in Gardnerville, where she had been raised, according to SF Gate. Mr Bently, who is currently in London, said they had not divorced and described his wife as 'a wonderful human being who contributed so much to San Francisco'. He added: 'She was greatly loved by family and friends, and we feel her loss deeply.' She had helped him run Bently Holdings, a property management company with offices in Minden, Nevada, and San Francisco, during the week, and designed jewellery on her days off. Mrs Bently, whose jewellery was exhibited at the de Young Museum in San Francisco in 2009, also helped her . husband with a luxurious revamp of the former Federal Reserve Bank in downtown San . Francisco, which they renamed Bently Reserve. Mr Bently also runs several companies founded by his late father, Donald Bently, an engineer, philanthropist and businessman who died in October at the age of 87.

About four years ago, they couple featured as the 'new kids on the block' on the San Francisco Social Diary website, after throwing a pajama party at their Nob Hill penthouse. They . loved the Burning Man atmosphere so much that they felt a pajama party . was the best way to introduce their festival and city friends for their . house warming. At the time, Social Diary reported: 'This artsy crowd lived up to expectations, no two dressed alike. PJs covered the gamut from Brooks Brothers and flannels to oriental robes and black negligees ... On the way home, I thought it was hilarious seeing guests trotting around Nob Hill in their jammies.' In a sign of her generous nature to environmental charities, in September 2007, Mrs Bently flew Tippi . Hedren to San Francisco for a fundraising event. A portion of the money raised by selling Mrs Bently's hand-crafted . jewellery was donated to the actress's . Roar Foundation. The designer created her gold pieces, inset with crystals and stones, in the basement of their Nob Hill home. She told SF Luxe in 2007 that her interest in design had come about after she made bead necklaces with her husband to wear at the Burning Man festival. 'We kept going back to the bead store, and I kept making jewellery. And finally I'm like ""I've got to start selling these because I have too much,' she said. Revamp: The couple renovated San Francisco's old Federal Reserve Building and renamed it Bently Reserve . Mrs Bently added that she was drawn to the healing properties of rocks, adding: 'I wear a lot of rubies because I feel in balancing the chakras you are more creative and you are more open to a creative outlook.' Her one-off jewellery pieces, which she . sold in stores and at charity functions in San Francisco, reached prices of between $500 . to $6,500, according to Heavy.com. As well as environmental charities, Mrs Bently supported the Dress for Success program that helps provide women with suitable outfits to wear for job interviews in 2008, according to the San Francisco Sentinel.

Hanners said morale was high when he joined the force in 2006, but that changed four years later when Tommy Dawson became Auburn police chief. Hanners claimed Dawson introduced severe ticket quotas as a form of revenue-raising, which was enforced by officers down the chain of command. Dawson retired from a 26-year career in May after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. 'If . you didn't get the number of tickets, if you didn't get the 100 . contacts, you would get mandatory overtime, you'd get written up,' Hanners told reason.tv. 'But if you did . do well, the officer who wrote the most tickets and the one that came in . second were given gift cards for steak dinners and things like that.' Hanners' damning claims were backed up by audio of his superior, Sergeant Trey Neal, outlining the quota system. 'Officers will have 100 contacts per month, minimum. Forty of those may be warnings for traffic,' Neal can be heard saying. 'The . other 60 will be divided between traffic citations, non-traffic . citations, field interviews and custodial arrests. Do not be the one . that does not get 100. 'It's Saturday night. Let's go out there and make some contacts, put some asses in jail. 'Write some tickets and all that neat fun stuff we signed up to do when we signed up to do this job.' 'Revenue-raiser': Hanners accused Auburn police chief Tommy Dawson, pictured, of introducing stringent and unfair policing tactics . Hanners, a father of two, said he was 'appalled' at the quota system. 'I got into law enforcement to serve and protect, not be a . bully,' he said. 'I think personally it's revenue driven. They're pushing us to get more tickets and they're telling us they don't want . these little fix-it tickets. 'They want meat tickets. Something with a . fine. They'll look over your traffic log and if you've got a bunch of . low fine or no fine tickets, they'll tell you to switch and do more . speeding, more red lights.' But Hanners told reason.tv quotas were also shockingly met through arrests of innocent people. The father of two detailed how he and his partner once approached a man who appeared intoxicated. Although the man turned out to be lucid, Hanners said his supervising officer who witnessed the 'contact' told him to arrest the man for public intoxication to make up numbers. 'He pointed to me and said you need it for your stats. I told him it's not about what I need it's about what he needs and he doesn't need to go to jail,' Hanners said. 'So he got out of the car and ordered us to arrest him. I still refused. But my partner, scared for his job, went ahead and arrested the guy for public intoxication.' Complaint: Hanners said he was sacked after filing a 'grievance' in November . Unemployed: Hanners said he was the 'breadwinner' for his young family before he was forced out of the police force . Furious at the system, Hanners last year filed a grievance. He said he repeatedly voiced his concerns . through his chain of command, and the department said the requirements were necessary to increase productivity. He was sacked shortly after. 'I had no intention of dropping it [my complaint],' Hanners said. 'This is a problem in more places than Auburn, and I think . once the people know that they can hold their public officials . accountable, it’ll change.' Reason.tv stated Hanners is unemployed and is preparing to sue the department. According to City of Auburn council meeting minutes from August 2, 2011, Mayor Bill Ham presented Hanners with a five-year service pin for his work with the Public Safety Department.","Former cop Justin Hanners has accused Auburn police department of enforcing excessive ticket quotas .

A gang member who shot dead two undercover cops in New York in 2003 has been sentenced to death by lethal injection for the second time. Ronell Wilson was first handed the death sentence in 2007, but an appeal court later overruled it. However, the jury at his retrial took just over four hours to decide that the man responsible for killing James Nemorin and Rodney Andrews in Staten Island, should be sentenced to death. Conviction: Ronell Wilson has been sentenced to death for the second time after his first sentence was overturned in an appeals court . Prosecutors argued that the 31-year-old . was 'thriving' in the prison environment, where he had fathered a child . with one of his prison guards, according to the New York Post. They claimed that Wilson, who had poked . his tongue out at his victims' families when he was first sentenced to . death, should not be allowed to live out his days as a jailhouse . celebrity. Wilson was said to have shown a lack of remorse for his crimes, the prosecutors argued. 'When a cold killer executes two heroes for greed and glory and dumps their bodies on the street, the death penalty is perfectly justified ... We ask that you impose the ultimate punishment for the ultimate crime,' the court was told in closing arguments, according to SI Live. They added that Wilson had shot Mr Nemorin, the father of three children, in the head as he pleaded for his life. Moments earlier he had shot Mr Andrews, who was also a father, in the back of the head. The defence had argued that Wilson . was born into a troubled life, to a neglectful drug addict of a mother, . and an absent father. Victims: New York cops James Nemorin, left, and Rodney Andrews, were working undercover when they died . Defense . lawyer David Stern described his client as being a 'learning-disabled and . severely emotionally disturbed' man who had never been taught the . difference between right and wrong, SI Live said. The defense added that the prospect of growing old behind bars was enough of a punishment for Wilson. However, . Wilson was described in court as being threatening and bullying towards . other inmates. He also convinced prison guard Nancy Gonzalez to have . sex with him. Gonzalez, 29, who pleaded guilty to . have sex with Wilson between March and August 2012, gave birth to their . son, Justus, in March. Earlier . in the retrial, the families of Wilson's victims gave impact . statements. Mr Andrews's widow, Maryann, told the court: 'The pain will . never go away. The world kept moving, but time stopped for us.' According to the Daily News, . she added: 'Rodney loved his children so much. All he ever wanted was . to grow old with his children and see his children grow old. Our lives . were ruined.' Improper relationship: Prison guard Nancy Gonzalez arrives at court while still pregnant with Wilson's child earlier this year . 'I think what the jury recognized is not only the severity of the crimes that were committed but also that Ronell Wilson is not going to change,' Detectives Endowment Association president Michael Palladino, said. 'He’s a thug. It’s in his DNA. He actually enjoys it,' he added after the trial. Wilson will now be taken to death row at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. His trial was heard in a federal court because New York abolished the death penalty in 2004.","Retrial of Ronell Wilson who shot dead two undercover police officers .

Federal authorities have launched a major investigation into the handling of at least two alleged rapes at the University of Southern California after students filed a 107-page complaint. The U.S. Department of Education has opened a Title IX sex discrimination investigation into allegations made by more than a dozen USC students who claimed the school did not take appropriate action after reporting sexual abuse to college officials, which violated their civil rights, according to ABC News. One of the more shocking cases involved a woman who was allegedly told by campus police that her rape report was groundless because the assailant did not orgasm. 'Because he stopped, it was not rape,' the student was allegedly told by a Department of Public Safety detective, according to the complaint. 'Even though his penis penetrated your vagina, because he stopped, it was not a crime.' The complaint says the woman's case was consequently not referred to the Los Angeles Police Department. Tucker Reed, 23, who is a theater major at USC, says her ex-boyfriend raped her in December 2010. When she took her claims to university officials in December 2012, she said her case was not properly investigated . Ariella Mostov said officials ignored her claims that she was sexually assaulted and that afterwards, she was forced to attend classes with the suspect for an entire semester . Several students behind the complaint held a press conference earlier this week to talk about their cases. 'The process made me feel raped a second time,' said Tucker Reed, 23, who is a theater major at USC. Reed says her ex-boyfriend raped her in December 2010. When she took her claims to university officials in December 2012, she said her case was not properly investigated and that it was eventually dismissed. She says she had presented detectives with evidence of the assault, including a recording in which her alleged attacker admitted to the crime. Another student, Ariella Mostov, 21, said . officials ignored her claims that she was sexually assaulted and that . afterwards, she was forced attend classes with the suspect for an entire . semester. University of Southern California students hold a press conference on a federal complaint accusing the school of ignoring or mishandling dozens of sexual assault cases . 'USC was unwilling to make any accommodations for me,' she said, her voice shaking with emotion. 'I was outraged.' When another student went to the school's Department of Public Safety to report a sexual assault at a fraternity event, an officer told her and a friend that women should not 'go out, get drunk and expect not to get raped,' according to the complaint. The federal investigation is the latest in a series of inquiries into whether colleges are complying with the guidelines of Title IX, a federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in education. Similar complaints have been filed against other schools around the nation, including Occidental College, UC Berkeley, Dartmouth, Swarthmore and Yale.

The Mars Curiosity Rover has been caught on camera as it makes its way to an unexplored mountain on the red planet, leaving weaving set of tracks in its wake. The image, which was caught by a NASA camera orbiting Mars last month and released today by scientists, shows Rover making its way across the planet. The tracks lead back to a dark, blasted spot on the surface of Mars. The spot called the 'Bradbury Landing' is where Rover first touched down on the planet - and is named after the late sci-fi author Ray Bradbury. Scroll down for video . Pioneer: The Rover, which can be seen circled in red, makes its way up a mountain on Mars leaving a trail of tracks . The blue spots are where the rocket engines touched the sand on the red planet as it carefully lowered the 1-ton rover. When the picture was taken, the Curiosity Rover was exploring rocks called 'Shaler' before heading on a five-mile journey to Mount Sharp, according to space.com. NASA scientists are keen to discover what secrets Mount Sharp, which is 3.4miles high, holds in its layers about the changing environment on the planet. The main focus of the Curiosity Rover is to work out if Mars has ever supported life. Snow on ancient Mars is the most likely reason for the network of valleys that exist there, scientists revealed this week. Recent . findings by researchers at Brown University have shown that some . Martian valleys appear to have been caused by runoff from orographic . precipitation -- moisture carried part of the way up a mountain and . deposited on the slopes. Mission to Mars: View from Curiosity's arm-mounted camera after a long drive this week at Mount Sharp . The findings help to answer the question of whether water flowing on ancient Mars bubbled up from the ground or fell down from the atmosphere. Scientists studied four different . locations on Mars that they suspected had water-carved valleys, caused . by snow or rainfall when moist prevailing winds are pushed upward by mountain ridges. The . new findings, published in Geophysical Research Letters, are the most . detailed evidence yet of an orographic effect on ancient Mars and could . shed new light on the planet's early climate and atmosphere. Researchers at Brown University have shown that some Martian valleys (pictured) appear to have been caused by runoff from orographic precipitation -- moisture carried part of the way up a mountain and deposited on the slopes . Kat Scanlon, a geological sciences graduate student at Brown, led the research and is well-acquainted with the orographic effect. She did graduate work in meteorology in Hawaii, which is home to a quintessential orographic pattern. Moist tropical winds from the east are pushed upward when they hit the mountains of Hawaii's big island. The winds lack the kinetic energy to reach the mountain summit, so they dump their moisture on the eastern side of the island, making parts of it a tropical jungle. The findings help to answer the question of whether water flowing on ancient Mars bubbled up from the ground or fell down from the atmosphere. Nasa's Mars Curiosity rover (pictured) found evidence of 'drinkable' water in clay minerals in Gale crater, in March . The western side, in contrast, is nearly a desert because it sits in a rain shadow cast by the mountain peak. Ms Scanlon thought similar orographic patterns might have been at play on early Mars and that the valley networks might be an indicator. 'That's what immediately came to mind in trying to figure out if these valleys on Mars are precipitation related,' she said. The scientists started by identifying four Martian locations where valley networks were found along tall mountain ridges or raised crater rims. To establish the direction of the prevailing winds at each location, the researchers used a newly developed general circulation model (GCM) for Mars. The model simulated air movement based on the gas composition scientists think was present in the early Mars atmosphere. The team then used a model of orographic precipitation to determine where, given the prevailing winds from the GCM, precipitation would be likely to fall in each of the study areas. The new findings, published in Geophysical Research Letters, are the most detailed evidence yet of an orographic effect on ancient Mars and could shed new light on the planet's early climate and atmosphere. A photo of the red planet, taken by the Curiosity rover is pictured . The simulations showed that precipitation would have been heaviest at the heads of the densest valley networks. Ms Scanlon said: 'Their drainage density varies in the way you would expect from the complex response of precipitation to topography. We were able to confirm that in a pretty solid way.' The atmospheric parameters used in the GCM are based on other models that predict a cold climate on the red planet, so the precipitation modeled in this study was snow. However, the researchers said that the snow could have been melted by episodic warming conditions to form the valley networks and therefore it could also have rained on ancient Mars. Ms Scanlon said: 'The next step is to do some snowmelt modeling. 'The question is how fast can you melt a giant snowbank. Do you need rain? Is it even possible to get enough discharge [to carve the valleys] with just the snowmelt?' The answers to these questions could provide an insight into the climate on Mars billions of years ago.",Image was captured by a NASA camera last month and showed Rover heading to Mount Sharp .

Mr Thorpe, who is a stay-at-home father from St Albans, last night refused to stand down as a candidate as he insisted that it should not prevent him from standing for public office. He said: ‘I think we have had enough of manufactured politicians. ‘I think people should come from all different backgrounds. We only have to look in the Conservative Party; there are one or two criminals.’ He added: ‘That is all totally behind me, it was more than a decade ago. I was a PC for my local village in Colney Heath so people remember these things and when you want to do something else with your life they think it is a good idea to run you down.’ He claimed that the hen party, which was organised by the Sunday People, was a one-off and that his details had been added to an escorting website as a prank.

Jewish community leaders in Rome have called for authorities to bar any public celebration of the 100th birthday of a  convicted Nazi war criminal. Former SS officer  Erich Priebke is serving a life sentence under house arrest for his part in the 1944 massacre of 335 Italian civilians, including 75 Jews, . at caves south of Rome . But ten years ago, as the Nazi officer marked his 90th birthday, people travelled from Italy, Germany, France and Switzerland to celebrate. Former SS officer, Erich Priebke (in white cap) is serving a life sentence under house arrest for taking part in the 1944 massacre of 335 Italian civilians, including about 75 Jews . Ten years ago, as the Nazi officer marked his 90th birthday, people travelled from Italy, Germany, France and Switzerland to celebrate . It is rumoured that many are intending to make the journey again on July 29 as Priebke marks his centenary, the Jewish Daily Forward reports. The president of Rome’s Jewish community . Riccardo Pacifici has now called on Italy’s president and prime minister, the mayor of Rome and . other officials to bar people from 'paying homage' to Priebke at the house where . he is being held. He said: 'Priebke is a man who was condemned for war crimes, who has never . repented, who has never apologised, who has never had pity for the . families of the victims.' It is rumoured that many are intending to make the journey again on July 29 as Priebke marks his centenary, angering the Jewish community, which has called for a ban on public celebrations . He added: 'The bone of contention is not the centenary of Priebke  but the tribute that many make to him by going to his house. It is to them that we express our indignation, not only as Jews but as Italians.' Wanted in Rome reports. The way in which Priebke's house arrest has been handled has also angered the local community. On Tuesday La Repubblica showed a video in which Priebke sauntered around in his local neighbourhoos in one of his reported 'daily walks'. And pictures published by the Italian weekly Oggi have previously shown Priebke eating at restaurants, riding a scooter . and shopping. Rome's Mayor Ignazio Marino has reportedly responded and said he would 'personally keep watch' to ensure no such public celebration takes place. On March 24, 1944  senior Nazis ordered the execution of 335 hostages - including 75 Jews - in retaliation for an attack on Rome’s Via Rasella, in which 33 German soldiers were killed. The way in which Priebke's house arrest has been handled has also angered the local community. He has apparently been seen dining with friends, shopping and riding a scooter. He was allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest 'because of poor health and age' It has been claimed that word was sent directly from Adolf Hitler via SS command in Rome that ten Italians should be slain for every German murdered. The killings should be carried out within 24 hours, he said. Priebke, responsible for overseeing the list of those killed, was accused of ordering the deaths of five more prisoners who were brought by error in to the caves. He is said to have personally killed two. After escaping from the . British prison camp in 1946 he travelled to Rome where he secured false . documents and moved to Argentina, settling in the ski resort San Carlos . de Bariloche, even becoming a delicatessen owner, it is said. Priebke is escorted by police as he is transferred to the Forte Boccea military prison in Rome after an appeal in the mid 1990s.

His past was only revealed in 1994, by investigative American journalists who were on the tail of another convicted war criminal. He was extradited to Italy in 1995, and was sentenced to life in prison. In 1999 he was allowed by authorities to serve his sentence under house arrest, on grounds of poor health and old age. His lawyers and friends have previously said he has turned to Christianity and has been a victim of a media witch hunt.","Erich Priebke is serving a life sentence under house arrest in Rome .

A pregnant woman and her female friend drowned on Tuesday night when they accidentally drove down a boat ramp into the ocean just minutes after they got lost hiking but were rescued by an off-duty firefighter. Mother-of-one Melissa Moyer, 38, a teacher from Sunbury, Pennsylvania, was visiting long-time friend Amy Stiner, 37, who was five months pregnant, in Machias, Maine when the two women went hiking at Roque Bluff State Park but got lost in the midst of a heavy downpour. Moyer called for help as it was getting dark and the friends were no doubt relieved when nearby landowner and member of Sunrise Search & Rescue, Wayne Hansom, found them and dropped them at Stiner's 2001 blue Dodge minivan. But as they left the parking area at . around 9 p.m., Stiner took a right turn instead of the left turn that . would have taken them back to town, and accidentally drove through the . heavy fog down a boat ramp and into the ocean. The pair and their dog . drowned in the submerged vehicle. Tragedy: Mother-of-one Melissa Moyer, 38, right, was visiting pregnant friend Amy Stiner, 37, left in Machias, Maine when the tragedy happened . Vehicle discovered: Rescue diver Travis Preston, a Jonesboro, Maine firefighter, hooks up the women's minivan in the water on the boat ramp on Wednesday at the scene of a double fatal accident the night before . 'The end of the road becomes the boat landing and they just weren't familiar with it,' Washington County Sheriff Donnie Smith said. 'It was foggy and rainy and they literally drove off the boat landing right into the water.' He added: 'It's just so easy to do. When I got the call last night, I knew what had happened.' Schoppee Point Road ends in the . remote boat landing. There are no homes or businesses in the area and . none of the fishing boats were occupied because of the late hour and . wild weather, Smith told the Kennebec Journal. Stiner, an organic farmer, was able to call 911 on a . cellphone as the car was becoming submerged. They reached Main State . Police barracks in Orono. 'They called on the phone that they . were in the water and the car was filling up. Then the phone went dead,' Smith said. 'An hour later, the deputies found the car.' Sheriff's deputies used the GPS on the cellphone used to locate the van, which by 10 p.m. was about 175 feet from shore.

Smith said the women were found in the . back seat, probably because the front of the vehicle would have sunk . first, providing them a few more gasps of air. The doors were closed . and the windows were up. Local fire departments, the Machias Police Department, Maine Marine Patrol and U.S. Coast Guard also helped search for the women after they called 911 from the vehicle. Stiner was also from Pennsylvania and had lived in Machias, a town of 300 people in eastern Maine, for around two years. Smith called the deaths a tragic accident made worse because Stiner was five months pregnant. 'This . lady lived on Kennebec Road. She wasn't far from home,' Smith said of . Stiner. 'I suspect they were cold and wet and just made a mistake.' Stiner's husband, Gregg, told media outside the couple's white farmhouse on Wednesday that he and Stiner were organic farmers. New to the area: Amy Stiner, pictured left and right, had only lived in the small Maine town for around a year. She was five months pregnant . Sad death: Stiner, pictured here with her husband Gregg and teh dog that was drowned with her, moved to Maine to start an organic farm and a family . He declined to talk any further about his wife or the harrowing accident. Friends . and work colleagues of the couple, Aaron Bell and Carly DelSignore, . described how Stiner and her husband moved to Maine to get into organic . farming and start a family, which is what they were doing when she . tragically died. 'Amy was fully dedicated to the local foods . movement,' Bell told the Bangor Daily News. 'They've been working with . us for two years.' The Stiners, Bell said, were raising 34 young . dairy heifers and about 1,000 chickens on leased land off Kennebec Road, . and sold their produce at local farmers markets each week. 'They were excited to get experience any way they could,' Bell said. 'This is just a tragedy. Everyone's in shock right now.' Sheriff Smith said Moyer's family, including Moyer's 12-year-old son, Alex, were headed to Maine on Wednesday. Since her death, the boy has . changed his Facebook profile and cover photograph to pictures of his . mother, whom he appeared close to.

Justin Anthony, a local fisherman, told the Bangor Daily News that he was at home on Tuesday night when several emergency vehicles drove past his house with their sirens blaring. He said he drove a couple of miles down to the ramp to see what was going on and saw that police and divers trying to get to the submerged vehicle. Anthony said the tide was about halfway in when the incident occurred.

'I stand before the people of the court, . the media, my family and friends, but mostly God, asking forgiveness and . confessing my sins,' he said, the Detroit Free Press reported.

'The story changed... on who drove to . the scene, how they made entry into the residence, bits and pieces that . were never mentioned,' Wehby said. He allegedly told investigators that he had . only hit Rose 'one or two times' in the head with a bat. Dr. Eric McDowell, from Botsford .

Rose Cipriano also had skull and . facial bone fractures and bleeding in her brain and Dr. McDowell, who . said he regularly deals with assault cases, said: 'This is certainly by far the worst that I've seen.' The testimony came after Assistant . Prosecutor John Skrzynski supplied jury members with graphic photos of . the bloody crime scene, showing blood splatted across surfaces . throughout the home.

Vermont authorities are warning residents in advance of a high-risk pedophile being released from prison Friday. Residents are being told to be extra cautious with their children as a high risk pedophile is set to be released from a state prison Friday, with 12 to 13-year-old blond-haired, blue-eyed boys said to be at highest risk, according to reports. 'It's . terrible they're letting him out. Once a pedophile, always a . pedophile,' Springfield, VT. resident Jamie Hooper said. Pervert: Timothy Szad received a 13-year setnece after admitting to carrying a 13-year-old autistic boy across a river, handcuffing and repeatedly sexually assaulting him, he will be released from prison Friday . Timothy Szad, 53, was sentenced to 13 . years in prison after handcuffing and repeatedly sexually assaulting a . 13-year-old autistic boy in 2000. With his sentence coming to an end . Friday, authorities are warning the public he is at risk for . re-offending, according to reports. Szad is required to notify the state of where he chooses to live, but he will not be under supervision. The pedophile received his sentence after agreeing to a plea deal that spared the boy from having to testify to Szad grabbing him, carrying him across a river, handcuffing and sexually assaulting him multiple times, according to the Burlington Free Press. Szad admitted to these acts in exchange for a lighter sentence than the maximum 20 years he would have faced if the case went to trial, the paper reported. Despite taking part in a sex offender treatment program, prison officials determined Szad is at high risk to offend again, according to reports. His most likely target would be blonde haired, blue eyed boys 12 to 13-years of age. Authorities’ efforts to notify the public in advance of the pervert being released have scuttled plans he had to move in with his parents, according to reports, leading to him potentially being homeless. ‘I wouldn't want him in my neighborhood. I don't think that you or anybody else would,’Rep. Kurt Wright, (R-Burlington) told WCAX. Szad’s case is renewing the push for Vermont to pass a civil confinement law meant to keep sex offenders with an inability to control their impulses off the streets indefinitely through confinement in a mental institution, according to reports. Despite the concern caused by Szad's release, he does have his defenders, including the American Civil Liberties Union. 'We . live in a society that operates by the rule of law,' Allen . Gilbert, executive director of the ACLU's Vermont chapter, said, adding 'courts . have determined the appropriate sentence for him, he's served his sentence, and . now he's getting out.' Another resident nearby the Springfield prison Szad is set to be released from expressed hope he would emerge a reformed man. 'Hopefully . if he's coming here, he'll commit to living a decent life,' Russell Hill said. Stranger danger: Vermont officials are warning residents in advance of Szad's release from this Vermont prison, saying that 12 to 13-year-old blond haired, blue eyed boys are at highest risk of abuse by Szad . The state legislature rejected passage of a civil confinement measure in 2007, citing the expense and high burden of proof needed to indefinitely commit an individual such as Szad, reports said. ‘I don't know whether the Legislature would be willing to go down that path. I've always believed it was a mistake not to pass it,’ Wright continued. Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin (D) told WCAX that he would strongly consider signing such a measure if passed by the state legislature, adding that he’s for ‘anything that the Legislature and we can do to make this state safer from pedophiles.’ Andy Bladyka, Springfield director of parks and recreation, said he had been . consulting with the police chief and town manager about Szad's release, but as . of Wednesday, no special precautions were being planned within Springfield's . summer youth programs. On alert: Several small town in Vermont, such as Springfield, where the prison Szad will be released from is located, are being warned to be more careful with their children after the convicted pedophile is set free Friday . Small town USA: Springfield, which was named the official hometown of the Simpsons and in 2007 hosted the animated movie's premiere, are being told by officials to look out for Timothy Szad . He said staff and volunteers are already trained with security in mind. For . example, he said, they are told not to leave a child alone after a program but . to ensure that each one has safe transportation home. 20 states, including New York and New Hampshire, currently have civil confinement measures in place. In a New York courtroom on Tuesday, former New York Gov. George Pataki . defended himself in a lawsuit brought by six convicted sex offenders who said . their constitutional rights were violated under a civil commitment law initiated . by Pataki. State Rep. Alice Emmons, a Springfield lawmaker who chairs the House . committee that oversees Vermont's prisons, said she opposes civil commitment . laws. ""You're holding someone who has not committed a (new) crime. Do we as a . society in Vermont want to do that?"" she asked. It is not clear if Szad had any criminal history prior to this conviction, repeated attempts to reach state and local officials for further information were unsuccessful.","Blond-haired, blue-eyed boy aged 12-13 considered at highest risk .

"By . Jaymi Mccann . PUBLISHED: . 03:23 EST, 25 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:22 EST, 25 July 2013 . Lance Armstrong has hit back after facing a lawsuit that claims he defrauded his sponsor, the US Postal Service. The cyclist said that they should have known he was doping, due to extensive media coverage. The lawsuit was filed by whistleblower, and fellow doper, Floyd Landis who also had his Tour de France title taken from him. Defence: Lance Armstrong's lawyers say that the USPS should have known about his doping . Under federal law Landis should be entitled to up to 25 per cent of the damages awarded in the suit.They are asking for $120million. Despite intense media speculation and an investigation into the cycling team in France, the US government renewed its sponsorship, argue Armstrong’s lawyers. They wrote: ‘Instead, the Postal Service renewed the Sponsorship Agreement and basked in the favorable publicity of its sponsorship,' reported Deadspin. Disgraced: Armstrong's lawyers claim that USPS reaped the rewards of their partnership . ‘It is now far too late for the government to revisit its choice to reap the benefits of sponsorship rather than investigate allegations of doping.’ Landis claims that Armstrong used false premises to obtain the government’s sponsorship money. Armstorng’s team of lawyers also claim that the suit has been filed after the statute of limitations has expired and that due to Landis’s own experiences with drugs, he shouldn’t be allowed damages. CBS wrote that Armstrong's council also said: ‘Although the government now pretends to be aggrieved by these allegations, its actions at the time are far more telling. ‘Did it immediately fire the Postal Service team? Did it suspend the team pending an investigation? … It did not.’ The motion added, ‘the government wanted a winner and all the publicity, exposure, and acclaim that goes along with being a sponsor. It got exactly what it bargained for.’ Armstrong was charged by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency with systematic cheating in June 2012. He was stripped of his Tour de France titles in October and severed official ties to Livestrong in November 2012. He admitted doping in a January 2013 television interview with celebrity host Oprah Winfrey. Armstrong has slowly begun to re-emerge in public since then. On Monday, he joined about 20,000 others in a segment of a bicycle ride across Iowa sponsored by the Des Moines Register newspaper. Confession: He admitted doping in a January 2013 television interview with celebrity host Oprah Winfrey . Denial: in 2005 Armstrong swore that he did not use drugs to win the Tour de France . 'People, in general, have been supportive,' he was quoted by the Register as saying of the reception he has received in Iowa. Asked about doping in cycling, he said: 'It wasn't a pretty time (in professional cycling). I didn't invent it and I didn't end it.' 'My bad for playing along,' he told the newspaper.","Armstrong's lawyers say USPS should have known he was doping .

But inside he discovered one the world's most legendary film cars - and is now set to make at least 10,000 times what he paid for the container. James Bond's Lotus Esprit submarine car, which featured in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me, is going up for auction in London where it is expected to reach $1million. Its owner, who has chosen to stay anonymous, found the car after buying the storage container in Long Island in 1989. Scroll down for video . Underwater: The car, nicknamed 'Wet Nellie' during filming, worked as a self-propelled submarine . Movie star: The car was one of several Lotus Esprit's modified for use in The Spy Who Loved Me . Auction: Although the car has been exhibited before it is now up for sale for the first time where it is expected to reach $1million . It is believed the Lotus was left in storage by the production company which paid for the container for 10 years. But when the payment ran out and nobody came to collect it, it was put up for sale. The man who bought it earns a 'very modest' living through his business which rents out construction tools. He did not recognise the car, which is not roadworthy, for what it was as he had reportedly never seen a Bond film at the time. When he pulled the covers off the car and found it had no wheels and a dented roof, he was less than thrilled with his buy. But as he drove the car home on the back of a truck, other drivers who recognised the vehicle radioed him to tell him what it was, CNBC reported. Back home he rented The Spy Who Loved Me on video, and realised how valuable his find was. The Lotus was nicknamed 'Wet Nellie' during filming and was built by a former Navy SEAL at a cost of around $100,000 - the equivalent to $500,000 today. Although Roger Moore starred as Bond in the film, the submarine car was driven by retired Navy SEAL Don Griffin during underwater filming. Film: The Spy Who Loved Me starred Roger Moore as James Bond . Shells: The production company used several different versions of the Lotus Esprit to film the chase scenes . Escape: Roger Moore and Barbara Bach flee the helicopter by driving off a pier into the sea in the submarine car . Specifications: James Bond's car was designed to convert into a submarine when underwater . There were actually several different Lotus Esprits used to film the sequence where Roger Moore and Barbara Bach escape the enemy by driving off a pier into the sea. The car up for sale is the only one that worked as a self-propelled submarine. Since its discovery the car has been exhibited from time to time but largely kept with its private owner. Now it will go under the hammer at RM Auctions in London on September 9, after James Bond expert Doug Redenius tracked down its owner and confirmed the Lotus's authencity. He told CNBC that he had told the owner to expect his fortunes to change 'dramatically'. Discovery: A small business owner found the valuable car after he bought a storage container in a blind auction for $100 . Rare find: The car is expected to reach $1million at auction in London next month . He said: 'I said ""Come September 9th, be prepared for your life . and your wife and your children—your life is going to change . dramatically."" And he said ""well, how so"" and I said ""First of all, . you're going to go down in history as the guy who found the James Bond . car. But then if it sells for what we're hoping, that money will give . you an opportunity to live very comfortably for the rest of your life.""' Max Girardo, managing director of RM Auctions Europe, said: 'Over the . years, millions of moviegoers have stared in awe as the Lotus . transformed itself into a submarine, and now, perhaps one of them will . have an opportunity to own it.' The 1964 Aston Martin DB5 driven by Sean Connery in Goldfinger and Thunderball was sold by RM Auctions for $4.4million in 2010.

'OK, . we believe we may have found a human head,' the man could be heard . telling a dispatcher on the call. 'We're out searching for a little boy, . Terry Smith,' the local station KESQ reported. Meanwhile, Shawna Smith denied any connection to the crime in the brief interview with the Los Angeles NBC affiliate. Doubts: Terry Jr.'s father believes something fishy is going on and that Shawna Smith knows more than she's letting on . ‘I was cleared by the police,’ she said. ‘Polygraphed -- came back clean. I had nothing to do with this.’ About . 1,000 volunteers had spent four days scouring an area of more than 50 . square miles in Southern California looking for Smith Jr, who . disappeared July 7.

During his first . hearing at the Southwest Justice Center in Murrieta, Atilano's detention . hearing was postponed until September 17, at which time a judge will . determine whether the teenager would be tried as a juvenile or as an . adult. Judge Timothy Freer said that Skylor had a 'history of violent outbursts' and that he had violated the terms of his probation. He would not elaborate on the nature of the teen's previous run-in with the law. Atilano was ordered to remain in jail ahead of his next court appearance. It is expected that the positive identification of the body found in the backyard of the Manifee residence will take anywhere from two to six weeks using DNA evidence, according to the Riverside County Coroner's Bureau. Vision: Pam Ragland was volunteering during the search for the missing boy and had a 'knowing' of where she should go to look for the body . Near home: The boys lived with their mother and her partner in the home center right, and Terry's body was found in a shallow grave by the tree back to the left, only 100 feet away . The psychic's revelation came the same day that the boy's father, who lives in West . Virginia, said that Terry was not autistic and that he had spoken to him . before he disappeared when the boy asked him if he could go visit.

Shawna now lives in Menifee with her longterm lesbian . partner, Denise, alng with Skylor and the daughter now removed from the home by authorities. Reeling: Denise (pictured), Terry's mother's longterm lesbian partner, said that the family is grieving . Heartbroken: The boy's father, Terry Smith Sr (pictured), is a retired truck driver who lives in West Virginia and he said that- in spite of Shawna's claims- he did not believe his son was autistic . Shawna initially described Terry Jr. as an autistic boy who took special medication and answered only to his nickname, 'JuJu.' His father, however, insisted that his son was not autistic, saying he was a normal kid who loved video games and baseball, he said. 'He was a very bright, well-adjusted child, at least he was when he left here,' said Smith Sr., a 62-year-old retired truck driver. 'He pushed buttons and would aggravate you. But, other than that, it was just the typical way... of a typical boy trying to get his way.' Smith Sr. also helped raise the half brother accused in the case, even though he was not his biological father, he said. The teen moved from West Virginia to California after his mother abruptly pulled him out of school, he said. 'I . taught him how to walk.

Two African American care home employees  have accused their bosses of stopping them working with a white patient as he refused to be cared for by black people. Shiawassee County Medical Care Facility, in Corunna, Michigan, allegedly told them that they could not work with the patient, according to TV5. Nursing assistant Andrea Butler said: '[I've] never, ever been treated like this before. It hurts, it really hurts, especially because I'm there to take care of them.' Shocked: Andrea Butler was told that she was not permitted to care for a white patient . Allegations: Shiawassee County Medical Care Facility, in Corunna, Michigan, allegedly told them that they could not work with the patient . She added that she was told of the news in front of staff and residents in the care home. The resident had complained of being bruised by an African American employee, but later admitted that the story was not true. She claims that the situations are very similar. Nurse Tonya Battle has spoken out about the case. She was told  by staff at Hurley medical Centre she couldn't care for a newborn at the request of the baby's white parents. Hurt: The nursing assistant was furious that the medical facility allowed it to happen . Respect: The hospital said that it has to listen to the wishes of its patients and that the situation would be dealt with the same if it was about gender not race . She said: ‘It's outrageous that a medical facility would grant this request, especially on the heels of the battle against Hurley Medical Centre case, that there was a public outcry that a patient's request based on race would be granted.’ ‘In my legal opinion, a patient can not request somebody to not work with them based on race. This is clearly illegal under federal law, I believe it's illegal under state law as well.’ The hospital was approached by TV5. Facility administrator Rick Cordonnier said: ‘We are protecting staff members from potential allegations.’ He said that they need to respect patient’s request for their care, and would treat the situation the same if they did not want someone of the opposite gender.

Expensive case: Aloke Ray, a lawyer with American firm White and Case, is embroiled in a costly divorce with his estranged wife Charoo Sekhri . A millionaire couple who met via an internet dating agency have risked ‘financial suicide’ fighting over a divorce, a court heard yesterday. Lawyer Aloke Ray and anaesthetist Charoo Sekhri have spent more than £860,000  on legal fees since separating two years ago. A High Court judge begged the warring couple to abandon the court battle, which has eroded almost a quarter of their combined wealth. Mr Ray, 41, who is a partner at the international law firm White & Case, is a specialist in dispute resolution. He owns property in Hampstead and Colindale in North London. Dr Sekhri, 39, is a paediatric anaesthetist who had worked at Great Ormond Street children’s hospital and had been living in Ealing, West London. The court’s family division heard that the ‘highly intelligent, successful’ professionals were married for less than two years, after meeting through an online dating agency in December 2008. Mr Justice Holman said: ‘They met through an online dating agency when each was in their mid-thirties. ‘They were already mature people. They were – and are – each highly intelligent, successful professional people. ‘They each felt that what they lacked in their lives was a long-term partner or spouse.’ The couple married in December 2009, a year after they met, and had a son another year later. But within months of the birth they began having violent arguments, and separated soon afterwards. The judge said: ‘This case  is the story of a tragedy ... under  two years after a marriage with so much promise, divorce became inevitable.’ He said the couple, who are both of Indian origin and currently live in Singapore, have spent a fortune arguing about where their divorce should be heard, even before the proceedings have begun. Dr Sekhri, who qualified as a doctor in India in 1996 and trained as an anaesthetist in London, issued divorce proceedings in London last April. The city has been nicknamed the ‘divorce capital of the world’ in legal circles, because its reputation for generous pay-outs for wives mean women are eager to have their divorces heard in Britain. Concern: A judge at London's High Court said that he begged the couple to resolve their differences or face possible 'financial suicide' Dr Sekhri has argued that she put her . successful career on hold to have the couple’s son, and should receive . compensation from her husband as well as maintenance payments while . their son is dependent on her. Mr . Ray, who studied at Oxford and Cambridge, opposed the application. The . court heard that much of the couple’s combined wealth was tied up in . property he bought before he met Dr Sekhri. However, . Mr Justice Holman ruled that Dr Sekhri was entitled to pursue . proceedings in London because both she and her estranged husband had . been legally ‘domiciled’ in England during their marriage. Neither Dr Sekhri nor Mr Ray attended the hearing. The judge told the court: ‘Somewhere the husband will have to make fair provision for the wife.’ He . said he had begged the couple to drop the costly legal fight about . where their divorce should be  decided during an earlier hearing in May . this year. ‘Each has spent a staggering sum of about £430,000 on worldwide legal costs, a combined total of over £860,000. ‘I begged these parties to resolve their differences. I referred to financial suicide. ‘The sustained forensic struggle throughout the hearing was painful to observe.’ He . added: ‘These parties are successful and prosperous but they are not . multi-millionaires. Their total combined wealth is around £4million. They have therefore spent just under a quarter of that wealth on . highly-charged litigation.’ No date has yet been set for the actual divorce proceedings.","Aloke Ray and Charoo Sekhri have each spent £430,000 on their divorce .

An example art class involves making a dragon out of card and glitter and lollipop sticks. ‘We have a lot of clients who are working mothers with a part or full-time nanny,’ says Maggie. ‘They want to know that they’ve got somewhere friendly and stimulating to go. We provide support to mothers, especially in the early years, which can be so isolating.’ The Kensington branch of Maggie & Rose is a convenient stone's throw away from the Palace . Co-founder of Maggie & Rose, Rose van Cutsem's family are close with the Prince of Wales (left) and Beverley Turner, Marina Fogle's Bump Class team member, says Kate should breastfeed (right) 'As . if there wasn’t enough pressure on her already, what we really need is .

'And to be applauded - not seethed at - for doing so.' There is a reason Kate might be more willing to take on Beverley's advice. She's . part of a trendy advice team clued up on all things births, . breastfeeding and parenting for new mothers set up by Marina Fogle - a . close friend of the Cambridges. 'We need women with power and . influence to get their milky bosoms out and feed smiling in paparazzi . pictures. Celebrity is depressingly powerful in dictating trends,' she writes. The number of new mothers breastfeeding is falling in England for the first time in almost a decade - 5,700 fewer women are opting for it this year and Beverley wants the influential Duchess to set an example and reignite the trend. FOC Marina Fogle, the wife of explorer Ben Fogle, is co-founder of high end ante-natal course the Bump Class. The couple were guests at the Catherine and William's wedding and it is rumoured that Kate partook in private sessions of the eight-course programme while pregnant with her son. Sessions include all aspects of post-natal care for yummy mummies (including stylist recommendations) and advice on breastfeeding. Post birth a consultant from the Bump Class is available via Skype or a personal visit to offer breastfeeding help.

While the third in line to the throne is the first grandchild for Carole, for Camilla it is her sixth.

Carole and Michael Middleton visiting the new parents and their bundle of joy at St Mary's Hospital yesterday . Sophie Wessex said she feels 'ridiculously happy' about the birth. 'It is a wonderful event. I'm hoping in the next few days to catch up with them,' she said. 'I have sent messages but haven't visited. Having had babies myself I know you really want to close down the hatches and be with your immediate family for the first few days and weeks. 'I never expected to feel quite this happy but I've had a big smile on my face every since the news broke. ' The two sets of grandparents arrived at . St Mary's to visit the newborn yesterday just moments before the Duke . and Duchess were to leave the hospital for their journey back to . Kensington Palace.

Then, it is thought that Kate will travel to Bucklebury to the mansion Carole and Michael bought earlier this year where she will spend the next four weeks under the wing of the Middleton before the couple are likely to join the Queen in Balmoral where she will be for the summer.

'The Matrix was my idea': Richard Bey said that the idea for the multi-billion dollar movie came from his undergraduate dissertation . A writer who claims the idea for the multi-billion dollar Matrix film trilogy was stolen from his university dissertation today took the makers of the film franchise to the High Court. Richard Bey said the inspiration for the movies came from his 10,000 word undergraduate dissertation he wrote between 1994 and 1996, whilst completing a social anthropology degree. The screenwriter or writers behind the . films have never been publicly identified and Mr Bey, 49, who lives in . London, says that the core ideas came from him. Tom Moody Stewart, for Warner Bros Entertainment UK Ltd, told the court: 'In the films, humans are treated as batteries - they are set within the bodies of a vastly powerful machine and the body is used to power the mechanism. 'The Wachowski brothers had full creative control over the films, but there is some mystique over who wrote the screenplay,' he said. 'There was certainly a screenplay. However, whether for publicity purposes or to fuel mystique, Warner have never identified everybody involved in the creative process. 'That may be something that has given rise to some of Mr Bey's assertions in this claim.' Mr Stewart went on to deny that there was any connection between the film and Mr Bey's work, written while he was an undergraduate at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London. He argued that ideas in a book that Mr Bey has written could not be taken into account, as it post-dated production of the films, which began in 1995. Mr Bey said that 'ideas about the nature of dreams and the mechanistic nature of the unconscious' in his dissertation about semiotics and race had been passed on by somebody at his university to Warner Bros. He claimed there was an 'intimate relationship' between SOAS and Warner Bros, as both have links to the Rockerfeller Institute. He told Mr Justice Vos that he had not yet put a value on his claim, but commented on the 'exceptional cultural value' of the trilogy and said that each film had grossed $1.3billion (£850million).

However he dashed the writer's hopes of a payout and allowed Warner Bros' application to strike out Mr Bey's claim.

"Camp directors have banned care packages after being frustrated with parents sending over-the-top boxes of toys and candy . Parents are fighting back by stuffing chocolate bars into socks, taping gum to magazine pages and burrowing holes in tennis balls . By . Catherine Townsend . PUBLISHED: . 10:24 EST, 24 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:45 EST, 24 July 2013 . As more and more camps ban care packages, parents are turning to increasingly elaborate smuggling routines to send their children goodies at summer camp. Camp directors have banned the boxes after becoming frustrated with the increasingly over-the-top stuffed toys and huge bags of candy sent by hyper-competitive parents. Now The New York Times reports that they are fighting back by hollowing out Harry Potter books, stuffing chocolate bars into socks and filling Tampax with candy. Sending treats: As more and more camp directors ban care packages, parents are going to greater lengths than ever to smuggle candy and toys to their kids . Many of the camps claim that they rules are in place because the packages promote . jealousy and attract vermin - but privately many admit that the real . problem is the adults. Each camp has . different restrictions. Some ban toys that look like weapons, while others may . define a care package as something that arrives in a box or padded . envelope,  or limit the amount that a child can receive. The website of Camp . Kabeyun in Alton Bay, New Hampshire warns parents that boys are required to open packages with a counselor - who will confiscate food and candy. Parents sign contracts saying that they understand the rules, but writer Bruce Feiler claims that they mostly ignore them. 'I heard more techniques for getting Twizzlers into . camps than getting nail files into prison,' he writes. Crafty parents tape gum into the pages of magazines, stuff chocolate bars into socks and even replace Tampax with candy. Other hiding places include deodorant sticks and pen or pencil boxes. One Girl Scout camp alum told the paper that her mom would open a box of tissues, remove the bottom half, fill with candy and use a hot-glue gun to reseal. Clinical psychologist Christopher . Thurber said that after finding out that the New Hampshire camp where he . works has a no-phone policy, a parent smuggled a fully-charged cell . phone inside a teddy bear. The term 'care package' originated . after World War II when the Cooperative for American Remittances to . Europe (CARE) began sending food to Europe, where many people were at risk of starvation. Over the next two decades, more than 100 million packages were delivered . around the world. Over time, the phrase became a generic term for . goodies sent to people away from home. For kids attending summer camp in the 1970s and 1980s, care packages were filled with Oreos, Twinkies, M&Ms and clothing. Now the stakes are higher, and parents feel that they have to keep up. There are now even online retailers offering customized care packages to cater to parents too busy to fill their own boxes. Malcolm Petty, co-owner of Sealed With a Kiss care-package distributor, tells the paper that the company faces twice as many restrictions on delivery today as in 2007. Bobby Strauss, the director of Camp Wigwam . in Maine, says that he still allows care packages, but encourages families to send no more than three a season. And not everyone believes that boxes make the camp experience better. Dr . Thurber, an author of The Summer Camp Handbook, said his research . found care packages make no difference in separation anxiety. If parents . must send something, he suggests a board game or a deck of cards.","Camp directors have banned care packages after being frustrated with parents sending over-the-top boxes of toys and candy .

A former environmental advisor to David Cameron killed a pigeon with his shoe after colliding with it as he cycled through London yesterday. Ben Goldsmith, the son of the late billionaire James Goldsmith and socialite Annabel Goldsmith, hit the bird as he cycled through Glasshouse Street near Piccadilly Circus. The financier tweeted about the bloody incident yesterday, as he described how he was forced to put the creature out of its misery by killing it with his shoe. Unfortunately, it would appear that coach full of school children also witnessed the gory spectacle, as he said that he a group of youngsters who spied the death were 'very upset' about it. He tweeted: 'Just biked over a pigeon. Had to kill it with my shoe. Really upset about it. So were the coachload of children who watched me do it.' The brother of MP Zac Goldsmith, who has been an environmentalist since he was 13, declined to comment on the incident. He is a co-founder of the WHEB group of green investment management businesses. The RSPB told the Daily Telegraph that the advisor should have taken the injured creature to a vet, who could have given a professional opinion about how to treat the hurt bird. Environmentalist Ben Goldsmith was clearly distressed about the unpleasant incident . A coachload of children allegedly saw the bloody killing in Glasshouse Street near Piccadilly Circus . It marks another unpleasant moment for the socialite this year. He and his former wife Kate Goldsmith were divorced in April in 65 seconds on the grounds of Kate's adultery. The multi-millionaire couple split last year after Mrs Goldsmith was believed to have had a passionate affair with American rapper Jay Electronica - leading to Mr Goldsmith's arrest for assault following a confrontation with his ex-wife and a bitter war of words over Twitter. Police arrested Mr Goldsmith at the couple’s £20million Kensington home in April 2011 on suspicion of actual bodily harm. It followed a confrontation between the Eton-educated financier, who inherited £300million after the death of his father, and his wife over explicit texts and emails between her and Jay Electronica. Ben Goldsmith and Kate Rothschild married at St Marys Church Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk in 2003, but after a very public and bitter row, were divorced in 2013 . Mr Goldsmith later accepted a caution for assault before announcing he was filing for divorce on grounds of adultery. The affidavit in support of Mr Goldsmith's petition says he first became aware of his wife's adultery on May 31, 2012, and this is also admitted in Mrs Goldsmith's acknowledgement of service of the divorce petition. The co-respondent was un-named in the documents. The couple were just 23 and 21 when they married in Paris in September 2003 and have three young children. After raging over Twitter, Mr Goldsmith admitted he was 'stupid' to have become embroiled in a nasty row after their breakup two years ago. He is now dating film producer Jemima Jones.","Ben Goldsmith collided with bird as he cycled through London .

A schoolboy who tried to perform a magic trick he had seen on TV had to be saved by his sister after he choked on a coin. Gabriel Albright had watched an illusionist put a penny in his mouth and then pull out two moments later and he wanted to do the same himself. But as he attempted to perform the stunt in front of his eight-year-old sister Minnie the coin got stuck in his throat and blocked his airway. Scroll down for video . Lifesaver: Minnie Albright, eight, saved her brother Gabriel when he started choking on a coin as he tried to copy a magic trick that he had seen on television . Minnie, who had life-saving classes in school, immediately stepped in and started beating her younger sibling on the back to dislodge the coin. Their mother and grandmother were both downstairs in the family home in Pembridge, Herefordshire, completely unaware of the drama that was unfolding. Despite Gabriel shaking as he . struggled to breathe, she also attempted . abdominal thrusts and kept her cool until the coin was dislodged. Minnie was hailed as a lifesaver by the British Heart Foundation today who had run first aid classes in her school. Her mother Merry, 36, said: 'I am so proud of my daughter. I had no idea that she had learned life saving skills in school, but I am so glad she did. 'If she hadn't been taught what to do, I'd probably only have one child still with us. Family delight: Minnie Albright (centre with the coin) thumped her brother Gabriel (green t-shirt) on the back to dislodge the coin. Her mother Merry (right), who is married to Ben (left) was downstairs and unaware what was going on . Happy siblings: Minnie Albright knew exactly what to do to help her brother as she had lifesaving classes in school from the British Heart Foundation . 'I would have completely panicked if I'd been in the same situation as Minnie was, but luckily, she kept her cool.' The siblings had been playing upstairs together when Gabriel slipped the penny into his mouth. And when Minnie heard him spluttering, she knew what to do. Mrs Albright, who runs a family housing business with her husband Ben, 36, said: 'Minnie said she turned round and Gabriel was twitching and his eyes had gone all bulgy and were watering. 'She had a look in his mouth and couldn't see anything, so she started slapping him on the back, then listening to see if he had started breathing again. 'She tried shaking him, and jiggling him about - and after the back slaps, that was enough to dislodge the coin. 'It came shooting out of his mouth and Minnie said he took a huge breath and started crying - it was only then that she thought to call for me. 'She said the only thing she had forgotten to do that she had been taught was shout for help.' Minnie shouted for her mother, who came running up the stairs, where Gabriel said: 'Minnie saved my life.' Trick: Gabriel Albright (right) had watched an illusionist put a penny in his mouth and pull out two - and wanted to show his sister Minnie that he could do the same . Minnie had been taught the British Heart Foundation's Heartstart course at Pembridge Primary School by her teacher Sarah James, who had recently taken part in Heartstart Instructor Training. The eight-year old used the technique of back blocks between the shoulder blades of her brother to save his life - just like she had been taught at school. Mrs Albright added: 'I can't thank the school enough for teaching my daughter these vital skills. 'I hope that by talking about what happened, more schools will think seriously about teaching their children these skills that could save a life.' She was so impressed by her daughter's quick-thinking after admitting she wouldn't have known what to do to help her son. Simon Gillespie, Chief Executive at the British Heart Foundation said: 'Minnie was heroic in saving her brother's life and she is a fantastic example of how learning emergency life skills can mean the difference between life and death. 'Sadly many people aren't lucky enough to have someone like Minnie on-hand when their life is in danger, meaning lives are needlessly lost every year. 'The Westminster Government should pay attention to Minnie's story and make Emergency Life Support a compulsory part of the curriculum so every child leaves school with the skills to save a life. 'I'm sure Minnie would say that emergency life support is the most important lesson she has ever learnt.'","Gabriel Albright was doing the trick in front of his sister Minnie, aged eight .

The police have refused to get involved in the increasingly bitter row between Ed Miliband's Labour party and his union paymasters. Officers today said they have found ‘insufficient grounds’ to launch a criminal probe into allegations of vote-rigging to select the party's new candidate in the Falkirk. Two senior party figures were suspended over claims the Unite union sought to fix the candidate election by flooding the local party with left-wing members. Labour leader Ed Miliband ordered a party dossier to be handed over to police to investigate claims of criminal wrongdoing in Falkirk . As the scandal threatened to engulf Mr Miliband's leadership earlier this month, the Labour party handed over an internal dossier to police in Scotland on Unite activity in Falkirk. But police said today there was not enough evidence currently to support a criminal investigation. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said if additional information came to light, this would be examined. She said: ‘Following a comprehensive review of all material submitted, Police Scotland has concluded there are insufficient grounds to support a criminal investigation at this time. ‘However, should further information come to light, this will be looked into.’ The row over the selection of a candidate to contest the seat, currently held by Eric Joyce, has sparked the biggest crisis for Mr Miliband took over as leader of the party. It put him on a collision course with Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, who has threatened to withhold millions of pounds in union backing without having influence on party policy. The vacancy emerged when Mr Joyce was kicked out of the Labour Party after committing an assault in a House of Commons bar. Threat: Unite general secretary Len McCluskey has warned his union will stop automatically 'handing over' millions of pounds to Labour . Last month Labour put the Falkirk constituency party under 'special measures' after an internal report raised concerns over the selection of a candidate for the next general election. This suggested that the local constituency may have been packed with new members in a bid to influence the choice of candidate. Labour went on to hand over documents to the police about claims that the Unite union had tried to fix the result of the candidate selection process by packing the constituency with members whose subscriptions it had paid. But the party's actions sparked a bitter dispute between it and Unite, whose leader Len McCluskey has dismissed the allegations as ‘nonsense’ and has claimed there is a  ‘smear campaign’ against the union. The dispute resulted in Karie Murphy, who was said to have been Unite's preferred candidate to fight the seat in 2015, and constituency chairman Stephen Deans being suspended from the party. Meanwhile, election co-ordinator Tom Watson - who has close links with Unite - stepped down from the Shadow Cabinet. In the wake of the Falkirk row, Mr Miliband has said he wants to ‘build a new way of doing politics' and turn Labour into a mass-membership party 'powered by the people'. Candidate: Karie Murphy, thought to be Unite's preferred candidate in Falkirk, as suspended from the party as the scandal erupted . Earlier this week, the Labour leader unveiled plans to hold a special conference next spring to seek the backing of his party for 'historic' reform to its links with the trade unions. Mr Miliband has already announced that he wants members of trade unions affiliated to Labour to be given the chance to 'opt in' to membership of the party, replacing a system where their political fund levy is automatically passed on to Labour unless they opt out. The move is designed to boost Labour membership from its current 200,000 and loosen the financial hold of union bosses over the party, but unions have warned that it could cost millions of pounds in lost donations. Vacancy: Labour had to launch a hunt for a new candidate in Falkirk after Eric Joyce quit . A Unite spokesman said: ‘Unite welcomes the police decision not to investigate the Falkirk selection, which appears to be based on an overdue application of common sense to the situation. ‘Unite reaffirms what it has always said - the union broke neither Labour Party rules nor the law in Falkirk. Those in the media who have smeared the union without evidence or justification should now hang their heads in shame. ‘We would hope that Labour will now lift the suspensions of Stevie Deans and Karie Murphy, agree to an independent investigation into what happened in Falkirk, and restore full rights to the constituency party as soon as possible.’ A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘As a result of the police decision, we will now pursue disciplinary action as a matter of urgency. ‘The internal Labour inquiry found there was enough evidence to concern us about membership recruitment in Falkirk. ‘We will act on this swiftly and thoroughly as we have done throughout this matter.’ However Scottish National Party's MSP for Falkirk West, Michael Matheson, said: ‘It is clear that this complaint to the police was little more than a stunt to divert attention from the Labour Party's own failure to deal with the crisis in Falkirk, and a waste of valuable police time. ‘Ed Miliband was happy to share this report with the police, but Labour's Scottish Executive has been kept completely in the dark - clearly London remains firmly in control. ‘Johann Lamont claimed she was the leader of all parts of the Labour Party in Scotland, but it is clear that her leadership is in name only, and Westminster is still calling the shots. ‘The people of Falkirk deserve so much better than this.’","Huge row over Unite union trying to seize control of Labour candidates .

A rogue builder has been fined more than £30,000 for forcing a bricklayer to balance in the bucket of a digger before hoisting him 20ft up in the air to avoid having to pay out for proper scaffolding. Residents on a new housing estate watched in horror as unfortunate brickie Paul Holder, 48, was ordered to climb into the bucket and fit window sills by the firm he was working for, Paddle Ltd. The company's then owner Derek Barnes, 75, has been ordered by the courts to pay £32,000 and Paddle has been slapped with an additional fine of £56,000 after admitting a breach of Work at Height Regulations. Precarious: Paddle flouted health and safety when bricklayer Paul Holder was hoisted in the air to fit window sills from the bucket of a digger . Defending Barnes and Paddle at a hearing at Swansea Crown Court earlier today,  Rebecca Hirst said he had been 'tired and frustrated' on the day in question, and denied accusations of a 'wholescale disregard for safety'. But the court heard Health and Safety chiefs were tipped off and caught the rogue building firm in the act. Prosecutor Robin Havard said: . 'Residents watched as Mr Holder perched himself on the bucket of the . digger and was raised to the top floor of the house. 'He worked in that precarious position because the company decided to use the digger rather than set up scaffolding.'

The court heard how another of Paddle's workers suffered a hairline fracture of the spine when scaffolding he was working from gave way. Bricklayer Daniel King, 22, plummeted 12ft when scaffolding collapsed because it had not been fixed to the ground properly. The court was told the firm's owner Derek Barnes, 75, didn't ask Mr King about his injuries and told him to carry on working. Mr King told the court: 'I can't believe how negligent, ignorant and incompetent their attitude was towards me.' Sentencing Barnes, the judge said he and Paddle had 'driven a coach and horses through safety regulations', and banned him from being a company director for three years as well as fining him.","Cowboy builder fined and banned from being a company director .

Britain's economy is firing on all cylinders for the first time since 2010 after official figures showed growth has doubled since the start of the year. George Osborne hailed growing indications that the UK is ‘on the mend’ as the Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product rose by 0.6 per cent in the three months to June, after a 0.3 per cent rise in the first quarter. It is the first time for two years that Britain has recorded back-to-back quarters of growth and bolstered hopes that the country is finally on the road to a sustainable recovery. Recovery: Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show the economy grew by 0.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2013, but remains 3.3 per cent below the pre-crash peak in 2008 . Crucially, all four sectors of the economy – services, industrial production, construction and agriculture – grew for the first time since 2010. The Chancellor said growth was well ahead of the 0.2 per cent forecast by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility at the time of the Budget in March – but warned there was a ‘long way to go’. The dominant services sector, which makes up three-quarters of economic output in Britain, was the driving force, as it grew by 0.6 per cent. But the smaller areas of the economy also grew. Production was up 0.6 per cent, with output from British factories up 0.4 per cent, while construction grew by 0.9 per cent and agriculture by 1.1 per cent. The news left Labour – which has repeatedly claimed the Government’s spending cuts are strangling growth and recovery – in a difficult position. Mr Osborne said: ‘Britain is holding its nerve, we are sticking to our plan, and the British economy is on the mend – but there is still a long way to go and I know things are still tough for families. Use your loaf: Chancellor George Osborne meets staff at Warburtons Bakery in Wednesbury near Birmingham ahead of the latest growth figures being released . Making dough: Confidence in the economy is at its highest level since the Coalition came to power, a new survey suggests . ‘So I will not let up in my determination to make sure we put right all that went wrong in our economy. ‘The people who should take the credit are businesses and hardworking families who have come through this period and we are starting to see the results.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said that while the recovery was ‘welcome’, it was still the slowest for 100 years. He added: ‘Families on middle and low incomes are still not seeing any recovery in their living standards. Most people will be thinking, “It’s working? It’s not working for me.”’ However, a poll by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research showed confidence in the economy is at its highest for more than three years. Yesterday’s figures also showed gross domestic product remains 3.3 per cent below its peak in Labour’s debt-fuelled boom, and wages and savings rates are failing to keep pace with the rising cost of living. They showed economic output crashed by 7.2 per cent in 2008 and 2009 as the crisis struck. ‘The numbers today confirm that we had one of the deepest recessions in our history, one of the deepest recessions in the world,’ Mr Osborne said. Despite the welcome figures, it is feared that an escalation of the crisis in the eurozone and the slowdown in China could yet knock the recovery off course. Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ‘For the first time since the financial crisis the economy looks and feels as if there is a tailwind behind it. We are optimistic the current rate of growth can be maintained.’ Budget pressure: Wage rises are failing to keep pace with increasing living costs, making it harder for workers to make ends meet . Ernst & Young Item Club adviser Nida Ali said: ‘This is very encouraging and qualifies as the right kind of growth that we have been lacking over the past couple of years.’ Yesterday's figures appeared to show that Britain is on the road to recovery. Here the Mail’s City Editor, Alex Brummer, gives his view. It has taken a long time to happen but the British economy finally started to motor in the three months to June. The figures suggest growth is running at a 1.4 per cent rate on an annual basis – more than twice the forecast made by the OBR in March. Even so, the British economy remains, along with that of Italy, among the worst performing of the G7 richest countries since the Great Recession  of 2008-09. Total output will have to rise by a further 3.3 per cent to return to where it was at the peak of the New Labour boom in early 2008. However, the really encouraging thing is that growth is gathering momentum with each successive quarter despite the drag on exports caused by the downturn in the eurozone. Hit the road: At 00.30am Mr Osborne joined workers improving junction 7 of the M6 . Machinery of government: The Chancellor climbed aboard the heavy plant being used to on the section of the M6 motorway near Birmingham . And even that may be taking a turn for the better with the German business confidence index climbing sharply. Behind Britain’s renaissance is a strong pick-up in the services economy, which includes everything from finance, to IT and the creative industries. Economic expansion is the result of tens of thousands of ordinary businesses having the confidence to invest and households having the courage to spend. It is significant that growth is now coming from all sectors, including industrial production and construction. There is a widespread belief among the economic analysts that the figures just released could yet be revised upwards to reflect the full scale of the improvement in construction aided by the Funding for Lending and Help to Buy schemes. Meanwhile all eyes will now be upon the first press conference of new Bank of England governor Mark Carney on August 7, when he has promised to provide guidance on the path to economic growth. This is expected to include a long period ahead of super-low interest rates of 0.5 per cent as well as continued support for measures designed to keep credit flowing.

A further sign of the improved conditions has been bumper results from some of our biggest enterprises, including aerospace engine supplier Rolls-Royce, consumer products giant Unilever and high street pub owner Mitchells & Butlers. One benefit of a faster-growing economy is that tax revenues such as VAT and income tax rise, helping to bring down the budget deficit. But if the Government really wants to drive longer-term recovery it will need to find more innovative ways of funding infrastructure spending, to adopt reforms to the planning system and to introduce more tax breaks for investment by small businesses.","Growth of 0.6% from April to June, up from 0.3% in first 3 months of 2013 .

We may sometimes be considered a nation of uptight prudes, but it at least half of us are working at turning that stereotype on its head. Some 49 per cent of Britons admit having had sex in a car at least once in their lifetime - and it's Fords, Volkswagens and Vauxhalls that see the most action. In fact, most people who confessed they had engaged in a bit of back seat hanky-panky were likely to have done it so least five times, according to research. Vroom vroom: Some 49 per cent of Britons admit having had sex in a car at least once in their lifetime - and it's Fords, Volkswagens and Vauxhalls that see the most action . You sexy thing: Cheeky little Ford Fiestas, left, proved the most popular cars in which to get down and dirty, while Volkswagen Golfs, right, came a close second, followed by the kicky little Vauxhall Corsa . Adults aged 35 to 55 were more likely to have had sex in a car compared to their younger counterparts, aged 18 to 34 (59 per cent compared with 38 per cent), according to the survey of 2,018 adults by car remanufacturer BBA Reman. When questioned on how many occasions . they'd had car sex in their lives, the average answer revealed by the . poll was five. But only 17 per cent of those confessing to having driven someone wild behind the wheel said that the last time they did it was in the last year, with 27 per cent admitting their last experience was more than 10 years ago. So perhaps we're actually getting more prudish? Researchers also quizzed people on their favourite make and model of car in which to get risque, as well as the most popular location for parking up when doing so. (At least we hope they were parked up...) Top down action: The most popular location in which to have a kiss and a cuddle was at a picturesque vantage point... but 3% of people said they had engaged in rumpy-pumpy while the car was actually in motion . Interestingly, smaller cars were more popular for, ahem, stretching the legs in than larger ones, with compact Ford Fiestas,  Volkswagen Golfs, Vauxhall Corsas and Minis coming top of the list. Safety first, kids: A reckless three per cent of people don't even bother to park the car before they lunge at one another . And when asked where the car had been . parked when they had embarked on their amourous activity, the most common . response was 'at a viewpoint' (37 per cent), followed by 'in a car park' (29 per cent) and 'on a driveway' (22 per cent). However, three per cent said their experience had . occurred in a moving vehicle. Chris Swan, founder of BBA Reman, said: 'We . all remember what it's like to be young and in love, but with very . little privacy or places to be alone with a partner. 'It seems that the . high number of older adults admitting to engaging in sexual activities . in their cars highlights a generation gap. 'Nowadays, it is much more . acceptable for younger unmarried couples to share a bed compared to . twenty or thirty years ago when they had to sneak away for some fun.'

A mother who lost four of her children in a fire started by a pyromaniac who was staying with her family has given birth to twins as she tries to move on from the tragedy. Michelle Smith, who attended every day of the seven-week trial, gave birth to a boy and a girl who are now aged six months. She had kept the new arrivals secret during the court case. Miss Smith, 37, lost her four-year-old twins Holly and Ella in the fire and their brothers Jordan, two, and Reece, 19. Killer Dyson Allen, 19, turned on the Smith family which had given him help and accommodation after he had been thrown out of his own home by his mother. The drunk and stoned teenager set a wardrobe on fire at the drug-fuelled party in Freckleton, Lancashire, as Miss Smith celebrated her 36th birthday. Allen was convicted of four counts of manslaughter yesterday and told he faced ‘a substantial prison sentence’. Miss Smith, who was best friends with Allen's mother, had taken the 19-year-old into her home in a gesture of kindness after he was forced to walk the streets over Christmas. Asked what the 18 months after the fire . ripped through her property on January 7 last year had been like, she described them simply as 'hell'. Although Reece, 19, tried to save his three siblings all four of the youngsters were killed by the effects of smoke inhalation. In a family statement issued on the steps of the court yesterday, Miss Smith said: 'We still do not know why our children were taken away from us. Even if we did know it would not bring them back.'

Smoke alarms had been fitted on the . stairs, but Reece had taken them down in the days before the fire . because one or both ‘kept making beeping noises’. Allen denied starting the fire, saying he was looking for a friend upstairs when he noticed an ‘orange glow’ under the door.

Plasterer Andy Barker thought it was the luckiest day of his life when he scooped £35,000 on Channel 4 quiz show Deal Or No Deal. But it was a windfall that would land the 43-year-old in prison. Amid the celebrations, Barker had forgotten one important point. He was declared bankrupt in November 2011, owing creditors £61,438, and was obliged by law to declare his winnings. Gamble: Bankrupt plasterer Andrew Barker blew the winnings from his appearance on Noel Edmonds show (pictured) Deal Or No Deal before paying off his creditors . But instead of informing the Official . Receiver, he put the cash in his NatWest account and then spent the lot . within three months. The winnings went on plane tickets, jewellery and . hotels. Barker's triumph on the popular Noel Edmonds show was brought to an end after an eagle-eyed viewer notified the authorities. The tip-off sparked an investigation by the Insolvency Service and prosecution by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills. At Warwick Crown Court, Barker, from Tamworth in Staffordshire, lost an appeal against the 13-week prison sentence imposed by magistrates for his failure to declare all the assets in his estate. Barker went on a three-month spending spree following his jackpot win on Deal Or No Deal. In that time he clocked up: . Tim Pole, barrister for the quiz show champ, told the court: 'What should have been a joyful moment has become a nightmare for him. 'For a man who has never been in trouble before and has worked hard all his life to suddenly make such a decision and find himself facing a custodial sentence, one can only imagine the impact it’s had on him.' Barker had admitted the offence at Nuneaton Court in April and also pleaded guilty to removing the money from his account contrary to the Insolvency Act. As well as jail, magistrates ordered him to pay £3,418 costs, but immediately granted him bail until the appeal was heard. Unlike Deal Or No Deal, he did not emerge from the hearing a winner. Divorced Barker had hoped to start a new career as a teacher, but that hope has been scuppered by the conviction. Judge Richard Griffith-Jones told him: 'You were a man of good character until this and there is to be no stigma or sense that because you were a bankrupt it makes it worse. 'A lot of decent people end up being bankrupt. 'But this was a flagrant breach of your duty to the Official Receiver, and you spent the money quickly.' After the case Glenn Wicks, Department of Business Innovation and Skills deputy chief investigations officer, said: 'Mr Barker thought he could get away with taking the money he had won and not informing the Official Receiver who could have used it to pay the creditors in his bankruptcy. 'He had, however, appeared publically on a television quiz show and was seen by people affected by his actions. 'This sentence should serve as a reminder that the rules of bankruptcy are there for a reason and must be followed. The courts take criminal offences like these very seriously.'","Plasterer jailed after blowing winnings on plane tickets, hotels, and jewellery .

The bells of Westminster Abbey rang out for three solid hours. But David Cameron chose to mark the birth of the royal prince in rather more under-stated fashion: with a pair of Union Flag cufflinks. Patriotic: The Prime Minister was sporting union flag cufflinks as he left Downing Street to travel to Crewe this morning . The Prime Minister usually wears shirts with a button cuff under his Savile Row suits. But as he left Downing Street today he was seen sporting silver cufflinks with a flash of red white a blue. He chatted on the steps of Number 10 with a cleaner about his delight at the news that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were the proud parents of a baby boy. Mr Cameron was up early this morning to catch up on the headlines before travelling to the Bentley factory in Crewe. It was announced that the firm was investing more than £800m and creating up to a thousand jobs to build 4,000 of its first 4x4 every year. But the news of the royal birth back was clearly uppermost in the Prime Minister’s thoughts as he got dressed this morning. All smiles: David Cameron was out and about in Downing Street early this morning, and discussed the royal baby news with a cleaner on the steps of Number 10 . Best of British: Mr Cameron spent the day visiting the Bentley factory in Crewe . Speaking outside 10 Downing Street last night, Mr Cameron said: ‘It is an important moment in the life of our nation but I suppose, above all, it is a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who have got a brand new baby boy. ‘It has been a remarkable few years for our Royal Family - a royal wedding that captured people's hearts, that extraordinary and magnificent Jubilee and now this royal birth - all from a family that has given this nation so much incredible service. ‘They can know that a proud nation is celebrating with a very proud and happy couple.’ But the Prime Minister’s beaming address to the nation triggered speculation he had lost a front tooth. Blast: Mr Cameron's cufflinks tribute were more understated than the 61-gun salute at the Tower of London . Mind the gap: Viewers watching David Cameron's statement on the royal baby thought it looked like he was missing a tooth . Mr Cameron looked gap-toothed as he declared the birth ‘an important moment in the life of our nation’. Senior government sources insisted the PM had not suffered a chipped tooth in the hours before news broke that the Duchess of Cornwall had given birth to a boy. ‘They've been like that for years,' said a source. Mr Cameron sent his congratulations from Downing Street and not the House of Commons because MPs have already begun their six-week summer recess. However a special message was sent to the new parents and the Queen by members of the House of Lords. Senior peers sent congratulations and urged for the family to be allowed privacy in the coming days. Cabinet minister Lords Hill said: ‘This is a very happy, first for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge personally as it is for any young couple that has experienced that mixture of wonder and relief when their first child is born. ‘But second for the whole country because it means that the succession to the throne is further secured. ‘No reigning Britain sovereign has been able to look quite so far ahead since the birth of his Royal Highness Prince Edward of York as a great grandson to Queen Victoria in 1894. ‘The bells are pealing from the Abbey, the guns have fired their salute but it is the crowds which have once again gathered outside Buckingham Palace which are the real mark of the great affection in which the Royal Family is held.’ Tributes: In the House of Lords Tory Cabinet minister Lord Hill and Labour's Baroness Royall said they hoped the baby prince would be given privacy . He went on: ‘We are right to celebrate this birth as a national event but I am sure we hope that the Duke and Duchess but perhaps particularly the new prince can have some privacy. ‘Royalty carries burdens as well as privilege and those burdens will fall on the young prince’s shoulders all too soon. ‘The new prince could not have a better example of duty and service than that set by his great grandmother and indeed his great grandfather.’ Labour’s Baroness Royall said: ‘This is a moment of real joy for the duke and the duchess. It is also a moment of real happiness for people right across Britain who will think with special affection of the Duchess as a new mother and her son.’ She added: ‘I trust however that the nation will allow them some privacy to delight in their family life.’","David Cameron had a small patriotic tribute up his sleeve today .

Comments: David Cameron said immigration is a constant drain on Britain and the nation had suffered a 'frightening' decade of 'lax' border policies . Immigration is a ‘constant drain’ on public services in Britain, David Cameron conceded yesterday. The Prime Minister said Britain had suffered a ‘frightening’ decade of ‘completely lax’ border policies, which had placed huge strain on communities. And he hinted at further measures to cut the number of people arriving in the UK. His comments come after the Office for Budget Responsibility warned Britain would need millions more immigrants in the coming decades to offset the effects of an ageing population. But Mr Cameron made clear yesterday that he wants to accelerate progress towards meeting his pledge to slash annual net migration – the number by which the population grows after both immigration and emigration have been counted – to the ‘tens of thousands’. During a question and answer session with workers at the headquarters of Bentley Motors in Crewe, Mr Cameron was asked why Britain lets in immigrants who are a ‘constant drain’ while others ‘work hard’. He replied: ‘I basically agree with you. There are some benefits from being a country that welcomes people who want to come here and work hard. ‘But in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that’s completely lax. The pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great.’ Mr Cameron said the Government has capped the number of migrants from outside the European Union by cracking down on bogus colleges. He also highlighted action to reduce the so-called ‘pull factors’ that attract people to this country, such as restricting access to benefits and the NHS. Agreement: Mr Cameron made his comments in response to a question posed during a Q&A session at the Bentley factory in Crewe . But he added: ‘I want to see it [net migration] coming down faster. ‘On housing, health, education and legal aid we are showing we are not a soft touch. ‘By the end of this Government, we will be able to look back and  say we may not have sorted out  the whole problem, but we have got a much tougher approach to immigration that’s fair.’ In the run-up  to the 2010 election Mr Cameron pledged to cut net migration by more than a half, from more than 200,000 a year to the ‘tens of thousands’. Progress in reducing the numbers has been frustrated by resistance from the Liberal Democrats and by the difficulty of limiting immigration from the EU. Last year the number of immigrants dropped by 89,000 to 153,000. But the fall was accompanied by warnings that limiting immigration could harm Britain’s economy in the long-term. Earlier this month, an OBR report warned an extra seven million migrants would be needed over the next 50 years to balance the effects of an ageing population. The figure is equal to 140,000 migrants per year. The report concluded that without a fresh wave of immigration  to boost employment and tax receipts, Britain’s public finances could become ‘unsustainable’. The OBR’s analysis suggests that Britain’s borrowing as a proportion of GDP would rise to 99 per cent  if there is a steady flow of immigrants. But if there was a complete ban on immigrants, borrowing would rise to 174 per cent of GDP.","PM made comments during Q&A session at Bentley factory in Crewe .

A teenage thug who killed a 'heroic' off-duty police officer with a single punch in an unprovoked attack was today jailed for just three-and-half years. Dale Dixon, 19, attacked Chris Findley, 33, as he was walking home from a night out with friends in Wolverhampton, West Midlands. The officer, who worked for West Midlands Police, was rushed to hospital after banging his head on the pavement as he fell but he died ten days later. Victim: PC Chris Findlay, 33, was walking home from a night out with friends when he was attacked by Dale Dixon. He died 10 days later in hospital . CCTV footage of the attack showed PC Findley exchanging words with two of Dixon's female friends outside a city centre bar. One of the women kicked out and threw punches at him as he calmly walked away before Dixon sprinted towards him and punched him. Relatives of PC Findlay gasped in court as the graphic footage showed him falling backwards and falling into the pavement. Dixon then wandered around the road with his one hand on his head before putting him in the recovery position and calling an ambulance. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the attacker, who later fled the scene, punched the police officer with such force that it broke his nose in three places. PC Findlay, who was left with a fractured skull following the attack on January 28, died on February 7 after suffering swelling to his brain. Dixon, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in a young offenders' institution - meaning he could be free in under two years. Attacker: Dale Dixon who was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in a Young Offenders' Institution after admitting manslaughter . Jailing him, Judge John Warner said: 'What's clear is that Christopher Findley was simply making his way down the street when he was confronted by one of two women that Dixon was with. 'He was not causing any trouble at all. Whatever it was, one of the women would simply not leave him alone. 'He was obviously trying to leave the scene as best he could. If she had simply let things go I very much doubt we would be where we are at court today. 'You can be seen running towards him at quite a pace. You were clearly going to launch some kind of assault upon him. 'When he turned his head, possibly having heard you running behind him, you hit him full in the face. 'You called the emergency services and subsequently left the scene in a taxi. 'You are a young man of a big build and the blow was hard enough to break his nose in three places and knock him out. An innocent man has unnecessarily and tragically lost his life. 'You had no intention of causing really serious injury let alone anything worse but as a result of your violent action a man has died.' Prosecutor Gareth Walters told the court PC Findley was well-liked and had been out drinking with friends in Wolverhampton on the night he died. He said: 'It was not a spontaneous assault. It was a severe blow shown by the triple fracture and he (the police officer) was unconscious before he hit the ground. 'There was nothing at all justifying the assault by the defendant.' William Dudley, mitigating, said that Dixon, of Wednesfield, West Midlands, was a man of previous good character. 'This . is a young man, 19 now, 18 at the time of the incident with no previous . conviction,' he said. 'This is not a gentleman who is shrugging his . shoulders. It had affected him deeply. 'What . the defendant will have to live with is the fact about what he has . done. That's the greatest punishment that can be suffered upon Mr . Dixon.' Scene: PC Findley became embroiled in the early . morning scuffle with Dixon and two women outside Divine Bar in . Wolverhampton at around 4:30am on January 28 . PC Findlay's mother Jackie Tabrett, 69, said she would never come to terms with the killing. 'Not a day has gone by since his death when I have not thought about him,' she said. 'He was a police officer for which I was very proud of him, he joined to keep people safe and protect them from harm and to put those individuals responsible for committing crime into the justice system. 'It's hard to believe that one of those people is responsible for taking my son's life. 'It still hasn't sunk in that I'll never see my son again and all that I have now are photographs and treasured memories. I don't think I'll ever in my lifetime come to terms with what has happened. 'The sentence handed out today cannot bring my son back, no sentence can do that.' Chris's friends collectively said in a statement that the police officer's killer would go free before he was even as old as the man he killed. 'Chris Findley or Fin as he was affectionately known by his many friends was a wonderful kind and considerate person with an infectious personality and incredible sense of humour,' the statement said. 'The ordeal of watching Fin's battle for survival after this mindless attack was an emotional rollercoaster. 'The sentence handed out today will not bring Fin back, and Dale Dixon will be released and walking the streets of Wolverhampton again before he is anywhere near to reaching the age of the man whose life he took.' Chief Superintendent Mark Robinson, from West Midlands Police, added: 'Our thoughts are with Chris's family, friends and colleagues today. 'This was a tragic case which resulted in the death of a valued member of the police service in Sandwell. 'He has previously been described fondly by his colleagues as a selfless and humble man, always watching out for those in need of cheering up, which he achieved through his warm, infectious personality and sense of humour. 'Chris was a proactive, hard-working officer who was a credit to the service and the communities of Sandwell.

David Cameron and wife Samantha boarded an EasyJet flight to Portugal today, as politicians plotted their summer escape from the Westminster village. Downing Street insisted the Prime Minister remained in charge after the Camerons and their three children boarded an 8am flight to Faro. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg jetted off to Spain earlier this week, claiming other senior ministers would be ‘holding the fort’ while the two most senior figures in the coalition were enjoying the sun overseas. Sun: David Cameron and his wife Samantha went to the Spanish Island of Ibiza for a short break in May this year but are now in Portugal . It is not the first time the PM has used a budget airline for his annual holiday. In 2011 he was pictured in a departure lounge waiting for a Ryanair flight to Granada. Despite having six weeks to ensure either the Prime Minister or his deputy were in Westminster, both Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg are on holiday at the same time – again. MPs began their long summer break a week ago and are not due back in Westminster until the beginning of September. Mr Clegg has admitted to being unable to co-ordinate his family holiday so it did not clash with the Camerons’, and other ministers will be in charge in their absence. The Prime Minister and his deputy faced criticism last year after they both jetted off at the same time. Questions were raised about the point of Mr Clegg was if he did not deputise in the Prime Minister’s absence. Take a break: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and wife Miriam were pictured enjoying a drink at a coffee shop's terrace close to their summer home in Olmedo, Valladolid in central Spain on Tuesday . It is not the first foreign holiday this year for either man - Mr Clegg enjoyed a ski break in the exclusive Davos resort in Switzerland in April while Mr Cameron went to Ibiza with his wife Samantha in June. On Tuesday Mr Clegg was pictured ordering a drink in a Spanish café with wife Miriam. Every year the Cleggs go to Olmedo, the Spanish town which is home to Miriam’s family. However Mr Clegg has admitted to wanting to travel further afield. ‘Now the kids are older I can get them to lobby against it,’  he was reported to have said. ‘Then I can say to my wife, “Sorry, Miriam, it’s not me – the kids want to go somewhere less dusty for a change.” ’ It is understood that after returning from spain, later in the summer the Cleggs will take a second break in France before returning to Spain. By contrast the Camerons are having a low-key break in Portugal before making their annual visit to Cornwall. They are also reported to planning a break in Scotland – in the middle of the campaign against independence. Taking charge: Foreign Secretary William Hague (left) and Home Secretary . Theresa May (right) will 'hold the fort' while the Prime Minister and . his deputy are on holiday this summer . However, senior aides were at pains to stress that Mr Cameron is still running Britain wherever he is in the world. ‘The PM is always in charge,’ said a Downing Street source. Earlier this month Mr Clegg suggested that Home Secretary Theresa May and Foreign Secretary William Hague would be sharing responsibility for keeping the wheels of government turning. Speaking on his LBC radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said: ‘The Prime Minister and I, we try where we can. We’re pragmatic about these things to make sure that as much as possible, we don’t go away at the same time but there’s not always a perfect match.’ He revealed there would be a ‘short period of time where both the Prime Minister and I are away’ this summer. ‘We’re sort of trying to hand over the baton to each other,’ he added. ‘ We’ve got other senior members of the government: William Hague, Foreign Secretary, the Home Secretary and others who in those periods of time where either the Prime Minister or I are away; both of us for either official reasons or during the recess, they can also hold the fort.’","David Cameron, wife Samantha and three children board 8am flight to Faro .

Fed-up officials secretly cleared the office of Tory grandee Lord Heseltine in an attempt to stop him popping into a government department, MailOnline can reveal. Ten months after the former Deputy Prime Minister published a report for the government on how to boost the economy, he still had use of a ministerial office at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Civil servants moved in earlier this week to pack his belongings into boxes, but have been ordered to put it all back after Downing Street intervened. Out of office: Officials at the Department for Business moved in to clear the office of Lord Heseltine 10 months after he finished his review . Lord Heseltine produced his report – No Stone Unturned – in October last year, setting out 89 recommendations for ways George Osborne could kickstart the economy. Since then he has had no formal role in government and had been awaiting further instruction from the Downing Street. But he has continued to the office given to him in the Business Department on Victoria Street in central London. His Jaguar became a frequent fixture in the department’s car park. Big beasts of the Tory party do not come much bigger than Lord Heseltine. He famously quit as Defence Secretary in Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1986 before challenging her for the Tory leadership four years later. While his bid failed, the Iron Lady was ousted and replaced by John Major who returned him to the Cabinet. Nicknamed Tarzan after swinging the ceremonial mace above his head during a debate in the Commons, Heseltine was Deputy Prime Minister when the Tories lost power in 1997. A strong advocate of economic intervention, he championed the regeneration of Liverpool. When the coalition was formed in 2010 David Cameron was keen to show he was using the experience in senior Tory ranks and asked Lord Heseltine to carry out a report into boosting regional economies. The study, published in October last year, was called No Stone Unturned In Pursuit of Growth and featured a cartoon of the politician peering under a boulder. Officials grew fed up with him ‘hanging around’ without a proper job. ‘He keeps coming in and using the office as if he is a minister,’ said a source. Exasperated mandarins sought ways to . ease him out without causing offence but it understood that earlier this . week staff sought to use the start of the parliamentary recess to . reclaim the office. ‘BIS had . been racking their brains ever since his review concluded about how to . get rid of him in a diplomatic way because he has kept coming in. ‘It’s not like he uses the office that often – but he uses it enough.’ In his report last year Lord Heseltine claimed ministers had failed to devise a ‘credible’ growth strategy and must put the country on an economic ‘war footing'. He urged Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne to act now on immigration, airports and energy policy if they want to boost growth. He called for £70billion of extra . funding for the regions to secure the economic recovery in areas outside . London and the south east. But when the government responded it pledged only £12billion, of which just a third was considered new money. The office was cleared earlier this week, but when Lord Heseltine found out Number 10 had to intervene. A . senior aide to David Cameron is understood to have told the department . that the office had to remain, and all of Lord Heseltine’s belongings . and papers returned. Lord Heseltine told MailOnline: ‘I do not know what BIS does with offices.’ He added that as far as he was aware he still had use of an office in BIS. Battleground: Senior civil servants had hoped to clear Lord Heseltine's office before the summer recess began . Intervention: An aide to David Cameron stepped in to resolve the office dispute over Lord Heseltine's office . A Department for Business spokesman said: 'Lord Heseltine's important root and branch review of growth has now been completed so he no longer in the department as frequently. 'But we have made clear that we will continue to meet any requests for office space he may have and have discussed this with his office.' Official ministerial cars have been borrowed by civil servants for their own use. Mandarins have been cleared to jump in the back of government limos when no one else is using them. Tory MP Gavin Williamson discovered the practice in a series of parliamentary questions. When the coalition was formed most ministers lost their dedicated car and driver to cut costs. Instead they were told to use a 'pool' when they needed a limo, but should use public transport where possible. But departments have admitted that when ministers leave them behind mandarins can be driven around in them instead. Mr Williamson told the BBC:  'I think some civil servants are still stuck in the world or Sir Humphrey and should recognise the fact that those cars aren't there to chauffeur them around in the lap of luxury. They're for the purpose of work.'","Staff at Department for Business, Innovation and Skills swooped this week .

A 'lost' site where the forces of Charles I won one of their biggest victories during the Civil War has been added to an English Heritage register of battlefields. The Royalists inflicted a heavy defeat on the Parliamentarians near Lostwithiel, Cornwall, during two battles that took place in August and September 1644. The exact sites where the fighting occurred, close to Restormel Castle, have been located by the Battlefields Trust following archaeological work and research in the archives. Battle: Royalist forces clash with Parliamentarians during the Battle of Naseby in 1645. The Battle of Lostwithiel in 1644 was regarded as one of the key turning points in the war . Battlefield: The fighting, which happened over ten days in 1644, occurred close to Restormel Castle on the outskirts of Lostwithiel, Cornwall . They have now been added to the National Heritage List which protects historically significant sites from development. The Royalists, who had around 12,000 footmen and 7,000 cavalry, pursued the outnumbered Parliamentarians to the outskirts of the town. When the Earl of Essex invaded Cornwall, a Royalist stronghold, he wrongly believed that he would have significant support in the area. Although he had around 10,000 men under his command, and at the end of the two battles which lasted 10 days, they were forced to surrender. The Earl eventually fled the site in a fishing boat. Charles I was present during the battle and is said to have slept with his troops under a hedge. Deborah Williams, an English Heritage designation team leader, said that the victory for Charles I was one of the key battles in the Civil War between 1642 and 1651. Artifacts: Remains of English Civil War weapons found in a field near Lostwithiel, Cornwall, which have enabled experts to pinpoint exactly where the battle in 1644 was fought . Weaponry: These are thought to be round shot (left) and musket balls (right) which were recovered from a field . Civil War turning point: This is a lead cannon shot recovered from the field near Lostwithiel . Battlefield: A sign at Castle Dore which marks the victory of the Royalists over the Parliamentarians in the battle in 1644 . Battlefields: The spots where fighting occurred during the two battles in 1644. The sites are now on an English Heritage register which helps protect them against future development . 'The Lostwithiel campaign of 1644 was one of the most wide-ranging battles of the civil war, marking a turning point in the war by delivering a Royalist victory, thus prolonging the war for several more bloody years,' she said. 'We are pleased that the significance of this decisive battle, to the south west and the nation, is recognised through designation. 'It is appropriate that such an important battle becomes the first addition to the list for some years. ' The addition of the two sites takes the total number of sites on the English Heritage register to 45. Frank Baldwin, chairman of the . Battlefields Trust said: 'These are the first battlefields to be . registered in England since 1995 and shows that the Register is a living . document. Fighting: The battles took place on land surrounding Restormel Castle (pictured) in 1644 . Civil war: The battle took place near Lostwithiel, Cornwall, in 1644 as the Parliamentarians invaded the county which was loyal to the Royalists . 'We have asked English Heritage to look at registering other battlefields, including the Wars of the Roses site at Edgcote. 'We hope English Heritage resolves these requests in the same positive way.' The Lostwithiel sites were not originally included on the register because it was unclear exactly where the battles took place. The registration of the battlefield . does not mean development on the site is forbidden, but the status of . the site must be taken into consideration. Troops: Roundhead soldiers - troops loyal to thwe Parliamentarians - during the Civil War. At the Battle of Lostwithiel they had around 12,000 footmen . The Battlefields Trust explained that the government's National Planning Policy Framework says that development of historic battlefields should be 'wholly exceptional'. Battlefields Trust development . officer Julian Humphrys said: 'Development and unsystematic metal . detecting without professional archaeological input are the main threats . to battlefields in the UK. 'But designation (as a battlefield) offers no absolute protection from either. 'Battlefields are ultimately local . issues and having people who who own or live near battlefields . interested in them is the best form of protection and that's what the . Battlefields Trust is all about.' When King Charles I took the throne in 1625, his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent . When King Charles I took the throne in 1625, his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent. His was a style of governance defined by religious dogma and a stubborn opposition to parliamentary rule. This bred feelings of alienation and deep mistrust in pockets of England, while in Scotland tensions with the English boiled over into bloody conflict. The embattled king was forced to form a parliament in 1640, and within this a vocal and highly critical Puritan faction began to grow. When a violent Catholic rebellion broke out in Ireland, disagreements over how to respond split England in two, and in 1642 the English Civil War broke out. The Royalists, based largely in the north and west, fought for the king, while the Roundheads, also known as Parliamentarians, came mainly from the south and east. They took their nickname from their preference for closely cropped hair, which set them apart from the ringlets of courtly Royalists. The battles that followed saw Charles's forces, bolstered by the Welsh and Cornish, clash with a Roundhead army swollen with Londoners. The Royalists looked to be on the brink of victory in 1643, until their enemies joined forces with the Scots. In 1644, the king's men suffered a crushing defeat at Marston Moor, North Yorkshire, effectively conceding the north. A further loss at Naseby, Northamptonshire, was the final nail in the coffin. The king gave himself up to the Scots and they promptly passed him on to their Roundhead allies, who were in the early stages of establishing a republican regime. He was executed in 1649, but not before inciting further clashes known as the Second Civil War.","Royalists inflicted heavy defeat on Parliamentarians during two battles near Lostwithiel, Cornwall, in 1644 .

North Yorkshire Police has issued CCTV of conmen who have been dressing up as women to trick elderly people into handing over their bank cards and PINs . One suspect is shown in a bank and is believed to be part of a team who don women's clothing to evade capture . Police in North Yorkshire are hunting the tricksters. Officers describe them as ‘very charming’ as they convince victims to part with their bank details and then go on to fleece their accounts. Under the scam, the fraudsters  call their victims on the phone, pretending to be from their bank or a utility company. They tell the elderly person there has been fraud committed against their bank account or that they have not paid a bill. The conmen then offer to send someone to the victim’s house to pick up their bank card in order to sort out the fraud or to settle the bill. At some point, as part of their ‘plausible’ act, the conmen  also manage to obtain the victim’s PIN from them. The gang, which struck on a number of occasions in Harrogate and York late last month and earlier this month, have succeeded in stealing thousands of pounds  after going to banks to withdraw money using their victims’ bank cards and PINs. At the time, senior North Yorkshire officers issued a warning  for residents to be on their guard for anyone they do not know  getting in touch or calling at  the door.

An SAS sniper convicted of illegally stashing a pistol and 338 bullets in his bedroom was spared jail yesterday but left court with his reputation in tatters. A judge reluctantly gave Sergeant Danny Nightingale, 38, a suspended two-year prison sentence but accused him of lying during his trial. Sgt Nightingale had claimed that a brain injury meant he made a ‘false confession’ to police that he brought the Glock 9mm firearm home from Iraq as a war trophy. And he blamed a comrade, known only as Soldier N, for planting the weapon and ammunition in his bedroom. Scroll down for video . Sentence: Danny Nightingale pictured arriving at his court martial hearing today with his wife Sally . Relief: Nightingale, pictured at the hearing today, has been spared a second prison sentence . But in a withering rebuke, Judge . Advocate General Jeff Blackett said the war hero’s account ‘lacked . credibility’. He said it was ‘inconceivable’ that Sgt Nightingale was . unaware the pistol and live rounds were stored in a wardrobe and under . his bed. Judge Blackett said the soldier had ‘made up a spurious defence’ and ‘impugned the character’ of a colleague. Sgt Nightingale, who had served on the . frontline in Iraq and Afghanistan during an 18-year career, ‘endangered . society’ by keeping the firearm in an unsecured rented home near SAS . headquarters in Hereford. Citing the gun massacres in Hungerford . in 1987 and Dunblane in 1996, he said: ‘This could have been a tempting . target for burglars and if there had been a burglary and the weapon and . ammunition had been taken, the consequences could have been . terrifying.’ Smile: The former sniper could have been jailed for up to five years and has already spent time in prison . Ordeal: Nightingale has spent £120,000 on his unsuccessful attempt to clear his name and may launch an appeal . Judge Blackett also attacked the . vigorous campaign, led by Sgt Nightingale’s wife Sally and backed by . MPs, after the soldier was jailed for 18 months over the charges last . November. His conviction was later quashed and a . retrial took place before a military court earlier this month. The . sniper denied the charges but was found guilty and appeared for . sentencing yesterday, when he was given two years’ military detention . suspended for 12 months. The judge said the campaign to clear . his name had been ‘misleading and uninformed’ and criticism of the . prosecution ‘totally without foundation’. He added: ‘We understand how difficult . these proceedings have been for you and your family. However, you have . brought much of that anguish upon yourself and your public assertions . that you are a scapegoat or the victim of some wider political agenda is . nonsense.’ Free: The Nightingales leave court today after it was announced that the sniper would avoid jail . Joy: Sally Nightingale spoke outside court about her relief at seeing her husband return home . Passing sentence, Judge Blackett . criticised politicians who made ‘unfounded and uninformed remarks under . the cloak of Parliamentary privilege. [I hope they] now realise how . inappropriate and wrong their criticisms were.’ He told Sgt Nightingale that the crime . was so serious it deserved an ‘immediate custodial sentence’. But he . took into account the soldier’s ‘exceptional’ record in the Army and . said he was ‘constrained’ by previous court rulings. Police found the weapon at the home . Sgt Nightingale shared with Soldier N after a tip-off. The sniper told . detectives he was given the Glock by Iraqi troops he trained and that . the ammunition was left over from his job as a range instructor. Gun: The former sniper smuggled this weapon out of Iraq and hid it in his bedroom . But at his trial Sgt Nightingale . insisted he had made a ‘false confession’ that he blamed on memory loss . caused by a brain injury suffered when he collapsed during a charity run . in the Brazilian jungle in 2009. He claimed that Soldier N, jailed . after admitting possessing another Glock, brought both pistols back from . Iraq and planted one in his bedroom to avoid a tougher sentence. Yesterday, Sgt Nightingale’s wife . Sally expressed anger at the comments of Judge Blackett. ‘I feel quite . upset that it’s been suggested that we misled people because that’s one . thing we have not done,’ she said outside the Military Court in Bulford, . Wiltshire. ‘We’ve been very honest and open. ‘Danny is angry about the words used in court against his family and the people who have supported him.’ Sgt Nightingale’s father, Humphrey, said the judge’s remarks were ‘a kick in the teeth’.

Jo Rust underwent drastic weight loss surgery five years ago after struggling to shed the weight shed piled on after having her children. After years of failed diets and with her weight sticking stubbornly at 20 stone, Jo Rust decided to have a gastric band fitted. The mother of two was delighted as the pounds rolled off and her dress size dropped from a 24 to a 12. But her weight kept falling and falling, and then she collapsed at work. At hospital, doctors assumed the gastric band was too tight and decided to remove it, only to discover her stomach had become tangled in the band and turned gangrenous. To save her life, surgeons had to remove 90 per cent of her stomach. Mrs Rust is now a healthy ten-and-a-half stone. But as a result of the surgery she never feels hungry – and has to set an alarm to remind her to eat six times a day. The operation left her with hardly any stomach lining, which produces the hormone that drives the hunger instinct. Her remaining stomach is so small that the 47-year-old can eat only tiny portions of food, using a baby’s bowl for her meals. ‘I haven’t felt hungry for months,’ she said yesterday. ‘I think it would take me days before I realised I haven’t eaten without the alarm reminder. Before having a gastric band fitted, Mrs Rust (pictured in 2007)  says she would devour biscuits, crisps, sandwiches and sausage rolls for lunch - and she would binge on sweets once a week . ‘When I was not working and recovering . at home I found it easier to remember, but now I am back at work full . time it is so easy to let it slip my mind. ‘The alarm is also important as it . makes my colleagues aware that I need to have something to eat, . otherwise meetings can go on for hours and I could be starving without . knowing it. ‘When I had the band I still felt . hungry, but it stopped me overeating. Now I have to force myself to eat . when I am not hungry. It is completely different psychologically.’ Due to a freak complication surgeons had to remove the majority of Mrs Rust's stomach, which means she never feels hungry. She now has to set an alarm on her phone to remind her to eat . Mrs Rust, of King’s Lynn, Norfolk, went up to 20 stone after having her daughters Holly, now 25, and Emilia, 21. The mother-of-two has dropped nine stone to weigh a healthy 11 stone 7lb . At work she would eat biscuits, crisps, sandwiches and sausage rolls for lunch and then binge on sweets. She had the gastric band fitted in . 2007 and slimmed to 11-and-a-half stone by eating three small meals a . day and exercising. However as the band failed her weight dropped . further. At the end of January she collapsed and had her stomach . removed. Despite her ordeal, she urged others to consider having a gastric band fitted. ‘I have no regrets,’ she said. ‘The band is the best thing I have . ever done.

Jnr had been a promising golfer and Bridget a 'typical, smiling, . innocent young girl', who, had things gone as they should, would not . have been in the house that night. Thomas Sharkey Snr, 50, pictured with his wife Angela, who died in blaze in his home in Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute . Thomas Sharkey Jnr, 21, and Bridget Sharkey, 8, pictured when they were younger, succumbed to gas and smoke . She . had come home early from a sleepover to be with her family and . tragically succumbed to the smoke and gas along with her brother, the . judge said. The pair were also convicted of attempting to murder clerical assistant Mrs Sharkey. After the verdict, she said she would never understand why they had killed her innocent children. At the time of his death, Thomas Jnr was on a golf scholarship to Georgia Southern University in the US and had just finished his second year studying accountancy. Bridget, described by an aunt as a 'bubbly, cheeky and extremely popular' girl, attended St Joseph's Primary School in Helensburgh and liked dancing and going to the Brownies. Mrs Sharkey said 'justice had been done' and Snowden and Jennings could not put any other family through what she had experienced. The jury heard that, on the morning of the fatal blaze, Jennings poured petrol through the letterbox at Scott Court on the instructions of Snowden, who was in Mexico at the time. Mr Sharkey Snr had intervened over a drug debt and Snowden was said to have hated him. The judge described the murders as the most appalling crime he had ever been involved with in my professional career . Thomas Sharkey Snr suffered a long and painful death and his children succumbed to the smoke and gas . A pub he planned to renovate and run was burned down weeks before it was due to open. Snowden was found guilty of six other charges of fire-raising, three assaults, one breach of the peace and supplying cocaine. Jennings was convicted of two . assaults, one charge of fireraising and one of supplying cocaine. He . faced three further charges of fireraising, which the jury found not . proven. The pair had denied the charges, . claiming prosecutors had failed to produce a motive and that several . witnesses had lied when giving evidence. Mrs Sharkey now . has to face the 'anguish' of going through the rest of her life . deprived of the love and companionship of her family, he added. The judge said Snowden and Jennings had waged a campaign of 'violence, revenge, intimidation and cowardice'. Terrible revenge was exacted on anyone who crossed Snowden, he said. The blaze engulfed the Sharkey's family home in Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, on July 24, 2011 . Snowden and Jennings will serve at least 33 and 29 years in jail respectively for their evil crime . A string of other attacks perpetrated by him had the potential to cause devastation and loss of life. Snowden had 'cowardly' recruited others to do his dirty work for him, making sure he had a 'cast-iron' alibi. If he thought he was safe from prosecution as others would not go to the authorities, he was wrong, the judge said. 'Those who failed to speak up at crucial stages before the events of July 24 bear a heavy burden of responsibility,' he added. The judge said that, by setting the fire, Jennings had perhaps not intended the full consequences of his actions. But by doing so he had 'virtually guaranteed' the result would be as terrible as it turned out to be. Snowden and Jennings will serve at least 33 and 29 years in jail respectively before they are eligible to apply for parole. The sentences were backdated to June 2012. Snowden is already serving a 19-month sentence imposed in December 2011 for drugs offences. Speaking before the sentence, Jennings’ defence counsel, Ian Duguid QC, said there was nothing that could mitigate the consequences of the fire at Scott Court. 'I think it can only be viewed as a terrible atrocity in the first place and a terrible tragedy for the Sharkey family,' he said.","Fire killed Thomas Sharkey, 21, his sister Bridget, 8, and father Thomas, 55 .

Add a little blue sky thinking to your office or business by installing a piece of aviation history to the boardroom. A Californian company called MotoArt has come up with an uplifting solution for what to do with decommissioned aircraft - it turns them into eye-catching office furniture. The craftsmen takes wings, spoilers, stabilisers, ailerons and engines from iconic planes such as the DC-4, the Boeing 727 and Boeing 747, C-119 and Albatross Aileron's and turns them into custom-made, glass-topped conference and office tables. The company also sells airplane seats. Motoart's newest Wing Conference Table, pictured, was created using parts from planes made by the Waco Aircraft Company. The company launched in 1920 with its initial floatplane design before launching open cockpit biplanes and later closed-cabin biplanes after 1930. Motoart's 1930 Waco Wing Conference Table has an art deco design and was crafted by hand. It was restored by Motoart and includes racing pant legs and glass to create the 24ft conference table . This conference room table was made using a General Electric engine nacelle from a Boeing 747. It's 12ft wide with a high-mirror polished table.

'The entire piece had to fit up an elevator to the 50th floor, so we had to design it to completely come apart.' Write caption here . This table was made using two ailerons from a C-119 aircraft. The original cloth was removed and the two ailerons were tapered and assembled to provide extra leg space and fit inside 15ft-long conference rooms.

Deployed during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the C-119 began as a troop and cargo hauler but was later fitted with weapons.

Additionally, the C-119 was deployed for aerial recoveries and the plane holds the world record for the first successful recovery of film from an orbiting satellite.It also was the first aircraft to perform an airborne film recovery from an object returning from Earth’s orbit. After the Vietnam War, the C-119’s were used by the U.S. Forest Service to battle wildfires. In 1987, after a series of crashes, the C-119 was deemed too dangerous to fly and all planes were taken out of service.

The custom made bamboo hardwood base can be stained or painted and the table can be outfitted for voice, power or data ports. Fulfilling United Airlines’ request for a long range passenger plane, the DC-4 was shifted to combat service during the war and was renamed the C-54. One of the C-54’s most notable missions was the Berlin Airlift where it operated alongside the C-47 to lift 5,000 tonnes of supplies into war-torn Berlin. The DC-4’s four wing engine design meant the plane could fly even if two of the four engines failed, and could maintain an altitude of over 5,000 feet with three engines down.

The Waco Aircraft Company, which sold parts for this conference table, contributed to the war effort by producing large numbers of military gliders for the US Army Air Forces and the RAF. They were also used during the Normandy Invasion and Operation Market Garden and ceased trading after World War II . The triple engine design made the smaller aircraft better suited for smaller landing strips and airline routes with smaller passenger demands. The 727 could also fly overseas and into higher altitude cities than the B-707. Since the B-727 was made for smaller airports, the plane needed to be serviceable quickly from the ground so an 'airstair' was designed allowing access to the cabin. MotoArt spends 140 hours making this airplane conference table, and it can be bought with airplane seats.

The table can also be fitted for voice, power and data ports. MotoArt owner Dave Hall said: 'If you can imagine it, we can do it. We can add portholes for telephone, computer or video cables, or perhaps you’d like a glass riser added to the middle of the table for video monitors.' The prices for each of the individual tables vary depending on the custom elements added or taken away and quotes can be obtained from the MotoArt website.","Recycled parts of decommission planes including the Boeing 727 and C-119 turned into office tables and chairs .

Karen Louise Shahan, 52, who was married to Reverend Richard Shahan of First Baptist Church in Birmingham, was discovered lifeless at 11:15 a.m. on Tuesday after she failed to show up to work. Police have not divulged how the grandmother, who for years sang in the church choir, was killed but said it was clear she had been murdered and the Homewood house was in 'disarray' when officers arrived. Crime scene: Karen Louise Shahan, 52, was murdered at her Homewood, Alabama house, pictured, earlier this week . Detectives have been scouring the property for clues. Shahan's husband was in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, visiting one of the couple's two sons when the horrific slaying took place, family friends said. The man, who is Children and Families pastor and Facilities Director, at the church, has been interviewed by police, who said they have no suspects in custody or motives in the murder. Husband: Shahan was married to Reverend Richard Shahan, pictured, a pastor at First Baptist Church of Birmingham . 'We don't know if this is random, a burglary gone bad or what,' Homewood police spokesman Sgt. Andrew Didcoct told AL.com. 'We just don't know.' Shahan's co-workers at Hobby Lobby in Wildwood notified police after the woman failed to show up for work on Tuesday morning. Church members gathered to remember Shahan on Wednesday night for their weekly dinner and Bible study. Bill Gladden, a church member and former attorney who works with the church on legal issues, described the woman as 'a lovely person.' On Thursday, First Baptist Church of Birmingham released a statement saying they were 'saddened to announce' the death of the long-time church member, who also sang in the church choir. A spokesman for Shahan's employer, Hobby Lobby, said the company was also 'deeply saddened by the loss.' 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to her family,' Parker said, according to AL.com. The Mayor of Homewood said the brutal murder of the woman who is survived by her husband, two sons, Kyle and Colin, and two grandchildren, had shaken the usually peaceful area. 'The City of Homewood has been blessed . for situations like this to be the exception and not the norm,' Scott . McBrayer told AL.com. Investigation: Investigators carried bags of evidence from the house as they continued to scour the property on Thursday . 'As with any other senseless act of violence, our thoughts and prayers go out to the family so deeply affected.' The street where Shahan was killed is quiet but not particularly close-knit because most residents rend rather than own their homes, neighbors said. Rachel Adkins, who lives down the road from the crime scene, said she was terrified after the attack and is getting an alarm system installed. 'I don't feel safe. No, not at all,' Adkins told AL.com. 'Hopefully we can get some answers soon, to know whether it was random or not.' She added: 'The actual violence of a murder happening just steps from my house is terrifying,'' she said. ""My husband was out of town then as well, so there's a 50/50 chance that if it was random, it could have been my house. I'm sad for the family.

Fugitive intelligence leaker Edward Snowden faces living under strict curbs imposed by the Russian security agencies when he is allowed to move from his hideaway in a Moscow airport transit zone, it emerged on Wednesday. The 30-year-old U.S. runaway remained in the zone last night after a last-minute glitch in plans to allow him to cross the border control pending a formal decision regarding his application for asylum. He is still expected to leave a cramped transit hotel soon but a senior Russian official said his movements would initially be strictly curtailed, even though President Vladimir Putin has denied his intelligence services are seeking secrets known to the former contractor for the National Security Agency. Scroll down for video... For now: Lawyer Anatoly Kucherena spoke tot he press after visiting Edward Snowden at Sheremetyevo airport. Kucherena said Snowden, who was rumored to be leaving the transit zone, will be staying 'for now' The revelation will fuel U.S. concerns that his undisclosed espionage data is in jeopardy. The White House was ‘seeking clarity’ about Snowden's status. Vladimir Volokh, the head of the public council of the Russian Federal Migration Service, insisted: ‘He will only be allowed to stay in places designated by Russian law enforcement agencies.’ Still stuck: U.S. whistleblower Snowden was said to have received the necessary documents to pass into Russia, be it now appears he's missing some documentation and must stay in Sheremetyevo Airport . It was not immediately clear why Snowden - who has been inundated with marriage proposals by Russian women - did not leave the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport on Wednesday. He has been holed up here for a month. It was earlier reported he had received the necessary document allowing him to cross into Russia pending his request for temporary political asylum. But his Kremlin-friendly lawyer Anatoly Kucherena insisted yesterday that he was remaining in the transit zone for now despite reports that he was poised to cross the Russian frontier and travel into central Moscow.  A large media pack were awaiting the move, but it appeared a key certificate was not yet ready. ‘He is staying here,’ he said. ‘He is here in the transit zone.’ While Snowden was fingerprinted pending his move, his application was ‘not a standard process’, and this caused delays. ‘There is lots of bureaucracy to get through, the documents are still being looked over,’ said Kucherena. Paperwork: Kucherena said there is 'lots of bureacracy' they must get around before he's able to help Snowden into Russia . False rumors: Snowden has been in Sheremetyevo Airport (pictured) for a month. He was falsely rumored to have left the transit zone Tuesday. He remained in the airport Wednesday awaiting paperwork . Buzz: Reporters swarmed Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena prior to his meeting with Snowden at the Moscow airport . Snowden has indicated he later hopes to secure exile in South America with offers from Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua, but yesterday his lawyer said he might apply for Russian citizenship. ‘Edward also asked me to thank all the women in Russia for offering him to marry them,’ added the lawyer. ‘He was in stitches of laughter when he heard that there were a lot of such proposals. ‘I passed him some clothes. I noticed that each time we meet he wears one and the same shirt. ‘So I went out and bought him some shirts and trousers so that he at least could have a chance to change. There is no laundry or ironing service in the conditions where he lives right now.’ The lawyer stressed Snowden is staying in the transit zone ‘for now’ and ‘intends to stay in Russia, study Russian culture.’ He brought the fugitive Russian classics by Anton Chekhov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel ‘Crime and Punishment.’ A-OK: Though the paperwork issue that's keeping Snowden in the Moscow airport, lawyer Anatoly Kucherena indicated to reporters that the American whistleblower continues to fair decently in his cramped hotel room . Airport security staff secure an area after Edward Snowden was granted documents that will allow him to leave the transit area, though the documents ultimately proved insufficient to allow him into Russia proper . Dragging on: View of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, which Snowden has called home for a month now. He nearly got out Tuesday night but his hopes were dashed as a bureaucratic snag halted his plans . The novel is about the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of a poor ex-student who kills a pawnbroker for her cash but Kucherena said: ‘I'm not implying he's going through a similar mental anguish.’ Russia has rejected white House calls for Snowden to be deported to the US to face espionage charges for leaking details of the NSA's wide-ranging spying activities targeting data and phone communication. Volokh confirmed Snowden would ‘not be extradited to any country where his life might be in danger, because he has applied for asylum here.’  Putin demanded that Snowden stops leaking secrets damaging to the US while he is in Russia. No change: Anticipation of Snowden's release was high as security officials sectioned off the airport, but that release never came and Snowden remains in flux, though his lawyer said he will get to leave 'soon'","The U.S. whistleblower lacked necessary document he needed to cross into Russia .

An Arizonan mother awaiting retrial after 23 years on death row has made a desperate plea for bail after learning that her own mother is dying of cancer, MailOnline can reveal. Debra Milke was found guilty of playing a part in the murder of her 4-year-old son Chrisopher in 1989. Her conviction was dramatically overturned in March when it emerged that the State had knowingly withheld evidence that lead detective, Armando Saldate, Jr, ‘lied under oath and trampled the constitutional rights of suspects.’ Mother love? Debra Milke pictured with her son Christopher,killed at the age of 4. Prosecutors portrayed her a callous murderer convicted by her own 'confession' Life Sentence: Debra Milke, now 49, has spent 23 years of her life on Death Row for the murder she maintains she did not commit . Speaking to MailOnline her attorney Michael Kimerer said: ‘It’s unbelievable that this is going to a retrial. I think for political reasons it’s one the prosecutor can’t let go. He can’t accept her innocence.’ Milke’s bail plea will be heard on August 1st and a date for her retrial has been set for 30 September. In a damning conclusion to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals’s findings four months ago, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski wrote: ‘The Phoenix Police Department and Saldate’s supervisors there should be ashamed of having given free rein to a lawless cop to misbehave again and again, undermining the integrity of the sytem they were sworn to uphold.’ The original trial which was Milke convicted and sentence to death was, according to Judge Kozinski, ‘essentially a swearing context between Milke and Phoenix Police Detective Armando Saldate, Jr.’ Final Days: Milke's mother, Renate Janka was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2010 and may not have long to live . There was no physical evidence connecting Milke to the crime and no corroborating testimony. The State’s case depended entirely on a confession extracted by Detective Armando Saldate, Jr . Milke has consistently denied the confession which was neither witnessed nor recorded. Saldate’s notes were not submitted at trial. Christopher Milke, 4, begged his mother to take hiim to the mall to see Santa Claus, instead she sent him with James Styers and sent him to his death . Convicted Killers: James Styers, left, and Roger Scott, right are both facing lethal injection for their crime . Yet, Judge Kozinski observed: ‘The judge and jury believed Saldate…they didn’t know about Saldate’s long history of lying under oath and other misconduct. The state knew…but didn’t disclose it.’ With barely concealed outrage Judge Kozinski added: ‘No civilized system of justice should have to depend on such flimsy evidence, quite possibly tainted by dishonesty or overzealousness, to decide whether to take someone’s life or liberty.’ Corrupt Witness: Phoenix Police Detective Armando Saldate 'lied under oath and trampled over suspects rights,' and his testimony convicted Debra Milke . In a statement seen by MailOnline and submitted by Milke’s mother, Renate Janka, to Maricopa County Court, Mrs Janka said: ‘In view of Judge Kozinski’s Opnion, it becomes less and less bearable what the State of AZ is putting us through. 'No civilized system of justice should have to depend on such flimsy evidence...tainted by dishonesty,' Chief Judge Alex Kozinki's Appeal Opinion . ‘For Debbie and I it is a constant mental stress between time left and utmost fear.’ Mrs Janka received the ‘devastating’ diagnosis of third stage Ovarian Cancer in June 2010. She underwent aggressive surgery and chemotherapy but Mrs Janka’s condition is terminal. Now living in Switzerland, Mrs Janka told of her agony as, two months ago, ‘my phone calls to Debra were cancelled without explanation. Then I was told not to write letters (only postcards), not to mention what the next few weeks will bring us.’ Judge Kozinski has set aside not only the conviction but has also barred the use of the 'so-called confession.' The facts of the case, such as they were known, were enough to shock America. On the last evening of his life, Chrisopher Milke saw Santa Claus at the mall near the home in Phoenix he shared with his mother and her room-mate James Styers. Christopher's family mourn where the little boy was shot and his body abandoned . If Looks Could Kill: Prosecutors argued that Milke murdered her son because of his resemblance to his father, the ex-husband she loathed, Mike 'Arizona' Milke, above left . He enjoyed it so much he woke the next morning and begged his mother to take him again. Milke, then 25, agreed but asked Styers to take him instead. On the way Styers picked up his friend Roger Scott. The two men drove the boy to a secluded ravine where Styers shot Christopher three times in the head. A Willing Walk to Death: Christopher trusted the men who told him he was going to see Santa Claus but abducted and shot him dead . Both Styers and Scott are currently on death row awaiting lethal injection for their part in the killing. In the immediate aftermath Scott implicated Milke. He claimed the three had plotted Chrisopher’s killing and planned to split his $50,000 life insurance. Much was made in trial of Mile’s hatred for Christopher’s father, her ex-husband, Mark ‘Arizona’ Milke and Christopher’s striking physical resemblance to him. But neither of Milke’s co-accused took the stand at the original trial. Styers  has vociferously maintained hat Milke had nothing to do with the killing that shocked America while Scott recanted his earlier claims. Speaking to MailOnline, Milke’s Phoenix based attorney, Michael Kimerer said: ‘We have learned from various sources that Styers and Scott continue to maintain that Milke had nothing to do with the killing.’ Both men, he said, have the added incentive of having their death penalties reduced to life sentences if they turn State witnesses.  Yet both continue to maintain Milke’s innocence.","Debra Milke was convicted of plotting the murder of son Christopher, 4, two decades ago .

He was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on Friday. Pc Blakelock, 40, was set upon by a mob armed with machetes and stabbed dozens of times in Tottenham, north London as he tried to protect firefighters tackling a blaze at a supermarket. It is claimed the policeman stumbled and was surrounded by a mob screaming, 'kill the pig'. He was knifed 42 times and it is believed his attackers tried to decapitate him in order to display his head on a pole in a gruesome taunt to other officers. Aftermath: The Broadwater Farm riot occurred in Tottenham, North, causing substantial damage to the residential area . Pc Blakelock had been sent down to the Broadwater Farm Estate with fellow officer PC Richard Coombes, and were trying to help firefighters who were tackling a blaze . Keith Blakelock's widow Elizabeth Johnson laid a wreath at a 2010 service on Muswell Hill Roundabout where the officer worked .

Pc Coombes also suffered serious injuries and never returned to duty. Race riots had erupted in north London after a West Indian woman, Cynthia Jarrett, 49, died from massive heart failure after police raided her home. Officers had stopped her son, Floyd Jarrett, 24, to inspect his car’s tax disc. He was charged with theft and assault at a Tottenham police station, but later cleared of both counts.

New York Magazine has identified seven unique types of people who use hashtags on Twitter, Facebook and in real life. The types range from Hashtag Stuffers who use multiple tags in every post, to Hash Swaggers, who only use them to brag, and Hashtag Stringers that combine numerous words together to create long tags. Hashtags are used on social networks, as well as apps such as Vine and Instagram, as a way of discovering new content but journalist Jeff Wilser claims that they are being abused. New York Magazine has identified seven unique types of people who use hashtags on Twitter, Facebook and in real life. The types range from Hashtag Stuffers who use multiple tags in every post, to Hash Swaggers who only use them to brag and Hashtag Stringers that combine numerous words together to create long tags . Wilser writes that hashtags are useful for promoting TV shows and charitable or worthy causes, such as the one used for World Aid's Day in December (#WAD2012). They can also be used for memes such as #FirstWorldProblems. However, he claims in the tongue-in-cheek blog that they have become overused and this has led to 'hashtag abuse'. To highlight the problem he has identified seven types of hashtag abusers. The Hashtag Stuffer is the most common form of hashtag abuse, according to Wilser. He writes: 'The Stuffer is incapable of simply sharing a photo of his July Fourth fireworks; he festoons it with #firework #fireworks #july4th #July4 #pretty #boom! #red #white #blue.' He adds that sometimes Hashtag Stuffers will even add tags into random words within the post. Hashtag Stuffers is the most common type of hashtag abuse, according to Wilser, . Stuffers add multiple hashtags to every post they write and even add tags into random words within the post. Verbal Hashtagger are the kind of people who use the word 'hashtag' in day-to-day conversations. Hashtag Stringers string multiple words together to form an extra long hashtag. Gratuitous Event Hashtaggers include people who go to events and then overuse the hashtag assigned to it. Hash Swaggers use event hashtags to brag about being at high-class or prestigious events. Hack-taggers are social network users that ambush the hashtags being used by companies, brands and politicians to protest.

Wilser claims that Hashtag Stuffers can't grasp the idea of the hashtag, or they are using a 'misguided attempt' to amplify their audience. Wilser's Verbal Hashtagger are the kind of people who use the word 'hashtag' in day-to-day conversations. People who string multiple words together to form an extra long hashtag have been labelled as Hashtag Stringers. Wilser claims that although this is 'sort of fun and clever' the novelty has worn off. The Gratuitous Event Hashtaggers include people who go to events and then overuse the hashtag assigned to it. An example given by Wilser said: 'Take my friend Jane, a film producer, who celebrated a friend’s birthday on a party bus that included a disco light and stripper pole. Facebook introduced clickable hashtags last month, pictured. As hashtags are used across more sites, journalist Jeff Wilser claims that they are becoming more abused and overused. People who use hashtags across platforms have been classed as Crutch Hashtaggers . 'After a round of champagne, the organiser shushed the crowd to say, ''The hashtag for today will be #Happy30SarahWonderland.'' 'Someone asked, ''Wait, is that ‘30,’ or ‘thirty’ spelled out?'' Similarly, Hash Swaggers use event hashtags to brag about being at high-class or prestigious events. Wilser adds that these are also known as Humblebrag-tags, or #HumbleTag. Hack-taggers are social network users that ambush the hashtags being used by companies, brands and politicians to protest. In December Starbucks asked people on Twitter to use the #spreadthecheer hashtag and have their messages displayed on a public screen. People began posting abusive messages, using this hashtag, that included 'Hey #Starbucks, PAY YOUR F***ING TAX #spreadthecheer' or 'I like buying coffee that tastes nice from a shop that pays tax. So I avoid @starbucks #spreadthecheer.' This was a response to Starbucks not paying the correct level of tax in the UK last year. And finally, people who use hashtags as a 'crutch' are Crutch Hashtaggers. Wilser said that this is the most subtle and 'most sneakily damaging abuse of hashtags' and includes people that use them constantly, across multiple platforms, in a bid to be witty or clarify the tone of a post.","New York Magazine has identified 7 types of hashtag abusers on the net .

Founded in 1997: Lance Armstrong's charity Livestrong saw its revenue drop to $38.1 million in 2012, from $48.8 million the previous year (Armstrong pictured in 2012) But the charity's Chief Financial Officer Greg Lee said the revenue amount did not include investment gains and other contributions, and Livestrong listed a much higher figure for 2012 total revenue of $48.1 million in its annual report. 'We were very happy that even though there were headwinds faced by investigations and other things around our founder, the foundation weathered through that very well,' Lee said in a conference call with journalists. Signature bands: Sales volume of its signature yellow bracelets had fallen 4.8 per cent . Armstrong founded Livestrong in 1997 after he survived testicular cancer and the charity has sold 87 million of the ubiquitous bracelets since they were introduced in 2004 to symbolize the fight against cancer. Armstrong was charged by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency with systematic cheating in June 2012. He was stripped of his Tour de France titles in October and severed official ties to Livestrong in November 2012. He admitted doping in a January 2013 television interview with celebrity host Oprah Winfrey. Armstrong has slowly begun to re-emerge in public since then. On Monday, he joined about 20,000 others in a segment of a bicycle ride across Iowa sponsored by the Des Moines Register newspaper. 'People, in general, have been supportive,' he was quoted by the Register as saying of the reception he has received in Iowa. Asked about doping in cycling, he said: 'It wasn't a pretty time (in professional cycling). I didn't invent it and I didn't end it.' 'My bad for playing along,' he told the newspaper.

Connecticut police decided against sending a hostage negotiator to the home of the Petit family on the morning they were brutally murdered, it has emerged. Jennifer Hawke-Petit was raped and strangled to death and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, were tied to their beds and died when the house in Cheshire was set alight on July 23, 2007. The girls' father, Dr. William Petit was beaten and tied up but escaped the flames, living to see Joshua Komisarjevsky and Stephen Hayes be sentenced to death in 2011 for the murders. On the sixth anniversary of the . horrific killings, the Hartford Courant has obtained police calls . through law enforcement sources showing that officers with the Cheshire . Police Department doubted the danger underway at the household. Torn apart: William Petit, right, was the only member of the family to escape alive. Jennifer Hawke-Petit was strangled and their daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, were killed in the flames . They were also outside the home when the murders were carried out and before the home was burned to the ground, it has emerged. Police were first alerted to trouble at the house when Hawke-Petit was taken to a Bank of America and forced to withdraw $15,000, where she told the teller she was being held hostage. When a police officer went to the bank 23 . minutes after the initial 911 call, he told a dispatcher in a recorded . phone call that he doubted the accuracy of Hawke-Petit's story. 'She came into the bank, she tried to get some money out,' Lt James Fasano told the dispatcher. 'One of the accounts was in her husband's name, and then she says, ""Well, my kids are at home tied up"". So we don't know if they really are or if she was just trying to get money out at this point.' He added that she had entered the bank alone and appeared calm, and that her captor had said nothing would happen to her as long as she handed over the money. The phone calls also include one in which a hostage negotiator, Eric Granoth, is told he was not . needed at the scene. Killers: Joshua Komisarjevsky, left, and Stephen Hayes, right, have been sentenced to death for the murders . Crime scene: The killers broke into this home in Cheshire and held the family hostage - but the police told a hostage negotiator not to report to the home. Authorities have not explained why . 'I need to know whether you want me in or . not,' he said in a 15-second conversation with dispatcher Donald Miller. 'I am the hostage negotiator and I got paged.' Miller then asked Deputy Chief . Joseph Popovich if he wanted the negotiator, and Miller can be heard telling Granoth 'not at this time' before hanging up. New Haven Public Defender Thomas Ullmann, who represented Hayes, said: 'The fact that a . hostage negotiator, listening to what was going on during the dispatch . communications, felt compelled to call central police headquarters . offering his assistance and then being turned away is shocking.' Miller then received a call from SWAT team member Kerry Nastri, who asks whether they should start suiting up and head to the scene - but Miller said officers said they would call on them if they were needed. Ten minutes later, Nastri called back to say they were going there anyway. Also shocking is how the police have never performed a review of the incident. Looking forward: Five years after losing his family, Dr Petit married Christine Paluf last year . Town Manager Michael Milone would not provide a reason for this, nor one for why the hostage negotiator was told not to go to the home. Cindy Renn, Jennifer Hawke-Petit's . sister, told the Courant that authorities have never carried out a . review of the incident or their actions. 'Nobody . in that department ever looked at what they did or didn't do right or . wrong,' Renn said. 'Admit when you make mistakes and do better the next . time and save people's lives.'

There is just one small drawback - the view. Hunts Copse Farm, in South Marston, Wiltshire, was once the centre of a 370-acre farmstead. Now  it is surrounded by a sprawling industrial estate. This stunning six-bedroom farmhouse complete with an orchard and impressive period features is on the market for just £395,000 - because it is in an industrial estate .

Next came a Honda factory, an industrial estate and then a B&Q national distribution centre the size of 20 football pitches - one of the biggest buildings in the UK. Experts say if the stunning stone-built farmhouse was set in a village it would easily fetch in excess of £1.5million when it goes to auction next month. But despite the unusual neighbours, surveyor Andrew Stibbard reckons new owners could ignore the industrial surroundings and live the life of a cut-price farmer. But the property was taken over by the Government at the start of the Second World War and an aircraft factory was built in the grounds . Experts say if the stunning stone-built farmhouse was set in a village it would easily fetch in excess of £1.5million when it goes to auction next month . 'It's surprisingly quiet here on a weekday, and at the weekend you'd have the place to yourself,' said Mr Stibbard, who is marketing the property for high-end estate agents Moore, Allen and Innocent. In a village setting, this farmhouse would set you back £1.5 million-plus. Where else are you going to pick up a six-bedroom period house for £395,000?' The enormous L-shaped home has wood panelled entrance halls and flagstone floors leading to three impressive reception rooms, boasting huge authentic fireplaces and huge sash windows. The farmhouse was converted into plush offices but has planning permission to become a boutique hotel, and consent pending to turn it back into a family home. It is surrounded by a Honda factory, an industrial estate and then a B&Q national distribution centre the size of 20 football pitches - one of the biggest buildings in the UK . It still has two-acres of private land behind a five-bar gated entrance, and a further acre of land enclosing a lake which will be auctioned as a separate lot. Mr Stibbard added: 'On the first floor are six bedrooms, including a well-proportioned master bedroom with large sash windows and period fireplace. On the second floor is an attic. 'I can see this property appealing to a small business looking for office accommodation in a historic building with interesting features, or a hotelier, but equally I can see the appeal to a large family that requires lots of rooms and space, both indoors and out.' `Viewing events have been scheduled for July 30 and August 6 and 13 between 4pm and 5.30pm.

Attack: Tory MEP Sajjid Karim criticised the 'anti-EU Taliban' in Conservative ranks who refuse to allow anyone to believe Britain should stay in the Eu . Eurosceptic Conservatives behave like the 'Taliban' towards other members of their party who do not want to sever ties with Brussels, a Tory MEP claimed today. Sajjid Karim made the explosive claim about his Tory colleagues who he claimed will not allow anyone to hold a view 'unless it's the same view as them'. His intervention came as David Cameron warned public support for the European Union as it stands today is ‘wafer-thin’. The Prime Minister claimed the economy would face more uncertainty if the country ‘put your head in the sand’ and pretended there was not a problem with Europe. He insisted Britain was better off staying in a reformed European Union, than leaving altogether. However, party unity over Europe was blown apart by the outspoken attack by Mr Karim on hardline Conservatives who want Britain to quit the EU. Writing on Twitter during a debate on Europe, he said: 'It seems the anti-EU taliban find it difficult to accept a different point of view!' He added: 'The ANTI-EU TALIBAN don't want an informed British public or an informed debate. Bring it on!' Mr Karim later insisted he had not used the term lightly, adding: 'That's exactly what they are.' 'You are no longer allowed to hold a view unless it's the same view as them,' he told Huffington Post. Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate . a ‘fresh settlement’ with the EU after the next election before staging . an in-out vote before the end of 2017. But . his policy suffered a major blow yesterday after an official government . review found the UK’s relationship with Brussels was ‘broadly . appropriate’. The . Prime Minister’s historic claim to have helped secure a cut in the EU’s . long-term budget was also criticised today by peers who said it is ‘not . as good as it looks’ because too many other concessions have been made. Uncertainty: David Cameron insisted business was still investing in the UK ahead of his promised EU referendum, as he visited the Bentley factory in Crewe where he met Bentley chairman and chief executive Dr Wolfgang Schreiber (left), apprentice engineer James Bate, and chairman of the board of the Volkswagen Group Dr Martin Winterkorn . A Tory-drafted Bill promising a referendum is being piloted through Parliament by MP James Wharton, but stands little chance of becoming law because both Labour and the Lib Dems oppose it. Today Mr Cameron was challenged over whether the uncertainty of an in-out vote by 2017 would deter big businesses from investing in Britain. Levels of immigration to Britain creates a 'constant drain' on public services, David Cameron suggested. The Prime Minister was asked during the Q&A session at the Bentley factory why the UK opens its doors to foreigners who are a 'constant drain' while others 'work hard'. Mr Cameron replied: 'I basically agree with you. There are some benefits from being a country that welcomes people who want to come here and work hard. 'But in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that's completely lax. 'The pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great.' He added that he wanted to see net migration 'coming down faster'. 'On housing, health, education and legal aid we are showing we are not a soft touch,' he said. Speaking at a PM Direct Q&A session at a Bentley car plant in Crewe, the prime minister replied: ‘I think a greater uncertainty would be to put your head in the sand and pretend there isn't a problem with Europe. ‘There is a problem and I'm going to fix it,’ he added. Mr Cameron went on: 'Europe is changing and Europe needs to change.  It’s 28 countries, 18 of which have the same currency – the euro – the other ten of which, like us, don’t. 'So, I’m saying to them, ""You need to sort your stuff out, and we’ll allow you to do that because you need to."" 'But at the same time, those countries like Britain where, frankly, consent for the European Union is wafer thin – we need changes, too. So, we’ll give you your changes if you give us our changes.  I believe I can negotiate that.' However a new government study that says membership of the European Union is beneficial for Britain was last night branded a ‘Whitehall whitewash’. Despite uncovering a catalogue of problems, the Foreign Office review found that the balance of power between Brussels and Westminster was ‘broadly appropriate’. The report sparked anger among Tory backbenchers, who questioned why it was commissioned in the first place since the conclusions appear to contradict Mr Cameron’s policy of renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels. Doubts were also raised about the deal to cut the EU’s budget, secured by Mr Cameron against expectations that Britain could pull off a spending reduction. Changes agreed earlier this month in the way the cash can be distributed between years, including rolling over unspent funds, are storing up problems for the future, peers told Treasury Minister Greg Clark. At the House of Lords sub-committee on EU finances, independent peer Lord Kerr claimed increased contributions to this year's single-year budget could hit the longer term agreement, known in Brussels jargon as the multi-annual financial framework (MFF). Patriotic: The Prime Minister was sporting union flag cufflinks as he left Downing Street to travel to Crewe this morning . Lord Kerr said: ‘My feeling is you have built up a problem for the future here because in order to get the parliament to agree to the MFF numbers you have given them, in the budget for this year, an extra £7.5 billion and if expenditure in each of the years of the MFF was at the level set from this year the MFF ceilings would be broken.' But Mr Clark insisted the UK had opposed the amending budgets to the single-year budget but was outvoted. He said: ‘We opposed the amending budgets. They reflected an argument that was made that there were bills unpaid that we felt should have been paid through redeployments but we were outvoted.’ The £822 billion MFF was backed by the European Parliament earlier this month after intense negotiations. It followed a fractious round of talks to get an agreement by governments in February, with Britain and Germany among states pushing for a real-terms cut in the face of opposition from countries that are net beneficiaries.","Sajjid Karim takes swipe at Tories who want to leave the European Union .

Matt and Cassey Topham, who won £45million in February 2012, have been giving planning permission for their dream home. The eight-bed house, which will boast a string of extravagant features including a sound-proof cinema, botanical garden and swimming pool, got the go-ahead after a meeting of councillors in Nottingham. Space-age: The couple have been given planning permission to build the eco-home . It will now be built on an exclusive road in the city dubbed ‘Millionaire’s Row’. A 1930s mansion that currently stands on the site will be torn down and replaced by the property, a partly-underground dwelling made of four separate pods clad in turf. Objections to the application were made by English Heritage, which said the design was not in keeping with the architectural heritage of the area, and one other councillor. But councillor Sally Longford, who represents Wollaton East, the ward in Nottingham where the home is to be built, approved of the plans. She said: 'I do think this is a fantastic, imaginative design which will sit well in the landscape. Artist's impression: The house will have eight bedrooms plus a swimming pool and private cinema . Estate: The couple said they would build their dream home when they won the lottery . 'The people could have chosen to live anywhere and I am quite glad they have chosen to live in my ward.' Councillor Malcolm Wood said there was no reason it should not sit among more traditional homes. He said: 'Over the years, I’ve been calling for more contemporary design and boy, have we got it.

The moonwalking Shetland pony whose fancy footwork won him an army of fans has lost a paternity battle. Socks starred in phone company Three’s latest advert, which has now had more than 5.2million views on YouTube. The 32-inch stallion was put out to stud, but only had eyes for a mare called Kimberley grazing in another field. Casanova: The 32-inch stallion Socks is an internet sensation . Refusing to be deterred, Socks swam 175 yards across a loch in order to reach her. Despite the dalliance, a DNA test has now revealed that Kimberley’s colt Scamp was actually sired by a rival pony called Nuggett. Owner Mari Williamson, 42, said: ‘Socks is a bit of a Casanova, but Nuggett has beaten him to it. I will have to contain his enthusiasm for the ladies a bit more next year.’ To rub insult into Socks’ wounded . pride, Felicity - one of Socks’ mares - has now also given birth to a . colt appropriately called Scallywag, also courtesy of Nuggett. Hair from Socks, Scamp and Kimberley were sent for genetic testing at a laboratory on the mainland. If it had been positive, Scamp would have been the first foal that Socks has fathered since his worldwide fame. Love rival: Nuggett sired black colt Scamp, though Socks was intended to be his father . Socks has only been a father once before, when two years ago he fathered a pretty filly called Quartz - who has the same skewbald markings as him.

'It has been a bit of a shambles but I am not disappointed - Scamp is a lovely black colt, whoever his father is. The funny thing is he has Socks’s cheeky personality, but the DNA test says he’s Nuggett’s. 'Socks is a very good swimmer. That loch is five-and-a-half feet in places but I will have to think about how to contain his enthusiasm for the ladies a bit more next year. 'He just fancied Kimberley more and thought the grass is always greener on the other side. But it now appears that even Felicity had a romance that day with Nuggett. It was his lucky day. 'There was a bit of fight afterwards between Nuggett and Socks. Sought-after mare: Mother Kimberley's DNA was sent for testing at a laboratory along with Socks' and son Scampy's . 'Socks was put in stables for two weeks after. It cost an arm and a leg for the DNA tests but it is important to keep the line correct.' If Scamp had been Socks’ son, he would have commanded an extra premium when he is sold. 'Scamp is a real character - cheeky and very friendly,' said Mari. 'He is a very good colt. I’m chuffed to bits with him. 'Socks has plenty of years as a stud in him, so we hope for more foals.' 'I would never part with him, no matter how much money I was offered. He is very special to me. Socks just has the presence. He is a very special pony. 'I've had goodwill messages from all over the world for him from Denmark to the USA.

Mari bought Socks from a village near Dalkeith when he was a yearling. She has one other stallion - Nuggett - and eight mares. Socks was even given the VIP treatment during his famous TV shoot by having his own hairdresser who attached 40 clips to his mane for each day of filming. Socks was prepared for his starring role for two weeks by local animal trainer Elaine Tait, who taught him to ‘moonwalk’ by giving him his favourite carrots as gifts. The advert was filmed by award-winning filmmaker Dougal Wilson, famed for his festive ads for John Lewis.

A real estate developer says James 'Whitey' Bulger once stuck a shotgun in his mouth and threatened to kill him and his family if he did not pay $200,000. 'He slammed the table. Then he takes a shotgun that was on the table and sticks it in my mouth,' Richard Buccheri said, his voice trembling, as he described the 1986 encounter. 'He said he wanted 200... he meant $200 thousand.' Buccheri says he was summoned to the meeting with Bulger after he gave his advice on a property dispute two neighbors were having. Buccheri says Bulger told him that his 'surrogate son,' Kevin Weeks, was buying one of the properties. Former mob boss and fugitive James 'Whitey' Bulger, who was arrested in Santa Monica, California on June 22, 2011, is accused of participating in 19 killings during the 1970s and `80s while leading the notorious Winter Hill Gang . Buccheri's testimony on Thursday, during the seventh week of Bulger's murder and racketeering trial, was the latest of many accounts of violence and extortion by people who dealt with the longtime leader of Boston's Winter Hill crime gang. Prosecutors are expected to finish making their case as soon as Friday. The 83-year-old Bulger, Boston's most feared crime boss during the 1970s and '80s, has been charged in connection with 19 murders. He has pleaded not guilty, though his lawyers have admitted Bulger was a drug dealer, extortionist and loan shark. Buccheri told the jurors that when Bulger removed the shotgun from his mouth, he picked up a handgun and pressed it against the side of his head. 'He said, ""If you don't pay me in 30 days I'm going to kill you and your family,""' Buccheri said. 'I agreed to pay.' Mourners gather following funeral services for Stephen 'Stippo' Rakes Thursday, whose body was discovered by a jogger July 17 in the woods of Lincoln, Mass. Bulger is accused of forcing Rakes to sell his store in 1984 to use as a headquarters for his gang . Pallbearers remove the casket of Stephen 'Stippo' Rakes from Gate of Heaven church following services in Boston's South Boston neighborhood Thursday . Bucheri's testimony comes after Bulger's former partner accused him before the jury of being a pedophile. Stephen 'The Rifleman' Flemmi had earlier acknowledged in testimony that he engaged in oral sex with his longtime girlfriend's teenage daughter, Deborah Hussey, who had called him 'Daddy' but lobbed the accusations back on Whitey when testifying Wednesday. Flemmi also testified that Bulger strangled Hussey after she started using drugs, getting arrested and dropping their names when she got in trouble. But Bulger's lawyer Hank Brennan . pressed Flemmi on his assertion and suggested that Flemmi, not Bulger, . killed Hussey after she told her mother he molested her. Flemmi didn't want to be seen as a pedophile, Brennan said. But Flemmi said that if Brennan . wanted to talk about pedophilia, 'right over there at that table,' gesturing toward where Bulger was seated. Stephen 'The Rifleman' Flemmi, (pictured left in 1974 and right in 2008), the former partner of reputed gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger, says he watched as Bulger strangled Flemmi's stepdaughter, a woman who had called him 'Daddy' since she was a toddler . Flemmi said Bulger killed Deborah Hussey (pictured) because she was using drugs, getting arrested and dropping their names when she got in trouble . Bulger glanced at Flemmi but did not . visibly react. Flemmi had told jurors earlier that Bulger once took a . 16-year-old girl to Mexico with him. He did not say when that was. Flemmi was in his fourth day testifying against the reputed Boston crime boss at Bulger's racketeering trial. Bulger, 83, is accused of participating in 19 killings during the 1970s and '80s while leading the notorious Winter Hill Gang. He fled Boston in 1994 and was one of the nation's most-wanted fugitives until he was captured in California two years ago. Flemmi, 79, has pleaded guilty to 10 murders and is serving a life sentence.

Testifying Monday, Flemmi acknowledged that he twice had oral sex with Hussey in what he called 'a moment of weakness'. Flemmi said Hussey's mother, Marion, . had been his live-in girlfriend since Hussey was just a toddler and that . she had called him 'Daddy' from a young age. 'A girl who called you 'Daddy' consented to sex with you?' Brennan asked. Flemmi said the sexual contact took place when Hussey became 'a different person' because of 'her demeanor, her lifestyle.' He said she had been frequenting Boston's Combat Zone, then a center of drugs and prostitution. Neither Brennan nor Flemmi specified how old Hussey was at the time. She was 26 when she was killed in 1985. Turning his testimony to her death, Flemmi said he reluctantly agreed to bring Hussey to a home in South Boston. 'Jim Bulger stepped out from behind . the top of the basement stairs and grabbed her by the throat and started . strangling her,' Flemmi said. 'He lost his balance and they both fell on the floor, and he continued strangling her.' When Bulger attorney Hank Brennan . initially asked Flemmi about whether he had a sexual relationship with . Hussey, Flemmi asked him to clarify whether he was talking about . intercourse or oral sex. He then acknowledged having oral sex with her . twice.

Flemmi said Bulger bragged about killing Donahue and another man . Hussey was one of three people who were buried in the same house after Bulger killed them, Weeks testified previously. He said he helped move the bodies later when the house was being sold. In 2000, after he began cooperating with the government, he led authorities to the bodies. Flemmi also testified on Monday that Bulger had boasted of a 1982 drive-by shooting in which he killed a mobster that he learned was an FBI informant. 'He had good firepower in the car and he was driving,' Flemmi said of the shooting in which Bulger killed Brian Halloran, the FBI informant, and another man, Michael Donahue. 'He leaned over and he fired from the passenger side and hit Donahue, killed Donahue,' Flemmi said. Bulger then shot Halloran as he tried to flee, Flemmi said. Bulger bragged about the killings during a meeting at Flemmi's mother's house, according to the testimony.","Richard Buccheri, a real estate developer, says reputed mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger demanded $200,000 from him in 1986 and threatened to kill him and his family if he didn't get the money .

Eating peppers twice a week could help reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease by up to a third. Scientists found individuals who ate foods containing an edible form of nicotine, which also includes tomatoes, potatoes and aubergines, gained a degree of protection against the condition. The research adds to evidence linking a reduced risk of the disease with smoking and the use of nicotine patches. Eating peppers twice a week could help reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease by up to a third . But experts urged caution, saying other constituents in the produce may have played a role in the findings, while the disease itself may also influence whether people smoke or eat certain foods. 'Our study is the first to investigate dietary nicotine and risk of developing Parkinson's disease,' said Dr Susan Searles Nielsen from the University of Washington in Seattle. 'Similar to the many studies that indicate tobacco use might reduce risk of Parkinson's, our findings also suggest a protective effect from nicotine, or perhaps a similar but less toxic chemical in peppers and tobacco.' For the new study, published in the journal Annals of Neurology, 490 patients newly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, were questioned about their dietary habits and tobacco use. A further 644 individuals not suffering from any neurological conditions also participated in the study. Vegetable consumption in general was not found to affect Parkinson's risk. But the likelihood of being diagnosed with Parkinson's reduced the more people ate vegetables from the Solanaceae family, which contain tiny amounts of nicotine, the addictive chemical in cigarettes. The trend was strongest for peppers, mainly in people with little or no previous exposure to tobacco, with participants who ate them at least twice a week found to be 30 per cent less likely to develop Parkinson's. Stimulation of nicotine-sensitive receptor molecules in the brain prevents the kind of nerve damage seen in Parkinson's (pictured) Although the evidence suggests nicotine to be the active ingredient, the team did not rule out another chemical shared by tobacco and its cousins being responsible for the effect. One possibility was anatabine, which had anti-inflammatory properties. Previous experiments in animals, showed stimulation of nicotine-sensitive receptor molecules in the brain prevents the kind of nerve damage seen in Parkinson's. Human population studies have also found those who smoke are less likely to develop the disease. Even passive smoking, which involves much less exposure to nicotine, seems to be protective. Parkinson's is a progressive condition in which damage to brain cells eventually leads to tremors, rigidity and slow movement, and there is currently no cure. Most people with the condition are aged 50 or over, and it affects about 127,000 people in Britain. Claire Bale, from the charity Parkinson's UK, said the study was too small to draw any concrete conclusions. She said: 'This was a small study which involved just over 1,000 people and to produce convincing results, these types of studies really need to involve much larger numbers - tens to hundreds of thousands. ‘It also studied a relatively young group of people, the average age was mid-60s, when Parkinson's is a condition which often develops much later in life. 'At the moment we don't fully understand the causes of Parkinson's and we don't know of anything which can prevent the condition, although there are a number of factors that may slightly lower risk including smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee and exercise.' Dietician Catherine Collins, from St George's Hospital NHS Trust in London, said the study provided further evidence of the benefits of a Mediterranean-style diet rich in vegetables such as tomatoes and peppers. But she said the findings had 'insufficient robustness' to justify promoting peppers as a protection against Parkinson's. Nicotine content can vary in vegetables due to growing conditions, storage, and harvesting and cooking methods.","Eating foods containing an edible form of nicotine reduces Parkinson's risk .

Originally from Italy, she is one of a new breed of landlords who move paying tenants into unclaimed properties . After pensioner Michael Rees died last year, leaving no surviving relatives, his neighbours wondered what would become of his house. They kept an eye on the £275,000 home and tended the front and rear gardens to make sure the property looked occupied. Then, after the terrace house had been empty for 13 months, an ‘Heir Hunter’ arrived on the scene and claimed it. But Maria Lauretta was not even a distant relative of the late owner. Instead she was an opportunist who changed the locks and announced she would be putting tenants into the property. The brazen Miss Lauretta even stuck a notice in the front window proclaiming: ‘Private Property – Keep Out’. Astonishingly, police deemed that she had not committed any crime, but the Treasury Solicitor’s department, which is responsible for the empty property, changed the locks again to keep Miss Lauretta out. The house, according to her own boasts, is not the first property she has appropriated. She represents a new trend in property developers, who scour government websites to locate the houses of those who have died without leaving a will. College lecturer Mr Rees, an only child, lived with his parents in the house in Bede Road, Chadwell Heath, Essex. His father Ernest died at the age of 76 in 1988 and his mother Gwendoline, 84, followed in 1999. Mr Rees, who was unmarried, stayed in the house until his death in April 2012, when he was 72. The homes of those who die intestate, like Mr Rees, pass into the hands of the Treasury Solicitor’s department. Known as ‘bona vacantia’ – Latin for ‘ownerless property’ – they are advertised on the department’s website, which is updated weekly, making it easy for squatters to find them and move in. If no one claims them they revert to state ownership and are sold. Last year the Government earned £12million from unclaimed estates. Two months ago, Miss Lauretta descended on Bede Road, where she asked a 14-year-old girl if the house was unoccupied. The empty £275,000 house which Miss Lauretta attempted to claim . The following evening she returned with a locksmith who changed the front door locks. Neighbours asked under whose authority she was acting after she apparently told the locksmith that she was a ‘solicitor’. She gave them a sheet of paper which quoted snippets from the Treasury Solicitor’s website about ‘bona vacantia’ properties. She wrote on the paper: ‘I would rather see an empty house brought back into productive use than left to rot without even any insurance.’ She said she would soon be moving paying tenants into the house, with rents being paid to her. Miss Lauretta told neighbours that she had ‘lots of other bona vacantia’ properties and one said: ‘She was so brazen. We asked her if she was a relative and all she would say was, “No, but I am legal. I am doing you a huge favour by putting tenants into the house”.’ After she left the shocked neighbours contacted their MP, Michael Gapes, and the Treasury Solicitor’s department. Maria Lauretta, pictured in her car. She changed the locks and announced she would be putting tenants into Mr Rees' property . Mr Gapes, Labour member for Ilford South, got in touch with police, and the Treasury Solicitor’s department employed another locksmith to change the new locks. Miss Lauretta, who runs three companies – Pridwen Properties Limited, Nander House Limited and Morgelay Limited – lives in Shoeburyness, near Southend-on-Sea, Essex. When approached by the Daily Mail she said: ‘I am not prepared to discuss anything with you. What I do is my business.’ Solicitor Richard Grosberg, former chairman of the Law Society’s Probate section, said: ‘Whatever this lady says it appears that she tried to steal a house rather like someone might try and steal a car. ‘While trespass is a civil matter I would have thought by breaking and entering into this property she has broken the criminal law. Impersonating a solicitor is also a criminal matter.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘Officers assessed the information available and no criminal offence was apparent.’ A spokesman for the Treasury Solicitor said: ‘The property was very quickly secured and it was made clear to the person who attempted to take possession of it  what the consequences of their actions could be. ‘Therefore, no formal civil or criminal action needed to be taken, but this will not always be the case.’ The popular BBC TV show Heir Hunters follows probate researchers trying to track down people who may be entitled to inherit estates. Around 30million people in the UK – half the population – have not made a will.","Property .

Many political observers feel that the plum post is a reward of sorts for Kennedy as her decision to lend her family name to the Obama campaign in 2008 as opposed to siding with the Hillary Clinton, who would have been the country's first female presidential nominee, was seen as a turning point in the competitive Democratic primary.

A study from the Centers for Disease Control was recently released and shows that over half of public pools are swimming with fecal matter. After testing 161 public pools in the Atlanta, Georgia area in the summer of 2012, the study found that 58 percent contained genetic material from the Escherichia coli. Murky issue: The CDC says over 50 percent of public pools are likely contaminated with fecal matter . It’s a bacteria most people know as E. coli. And what does E. coli mean? You guessed it! It means poo. The study, undertaken by the CDC’s Healthy Swimming Program, indicated that ‘Escherichia coli, a fecal indicator, was detected in 93 (58 percent) samples; detection signifies that swimmers introduced fecal material into pool water.’ You read right. Not only is your pool just a giant toilet, but it’s all your fault and you might not even know you’re doing it. Divey: The study of 161 public pools in Atlanta, Georgia showed that 58 percent contained e. coli bacteria, a 'fecal indicator' likely introduced by swimmers who don't shower first . The CDC wrote that ‘formed fecal incidents,’ as it calls them, aren’t the problem. Instead, the e. coli is introduced from the nether regions of swimmers who neglect to shower before taking a dip. ‘The average person has about .14 grams of feces on their rear end,’ Michele Hlavsa, who led the study, told NBC. ‘If that rinses off into the water, the amount from one person might not be that much. But as more and more swimmers introduce it that much, it does become an issue.’ Hlavsa all that introduced material can really pile up. ‘Let’s imagine 1,000 kids go to a water park. They have as much as 10 grams of feces on their rear ends,’ she said.  ‘We are now talking about 10,000 grams or 10 kg. That translates to 24 pounds of poop in the water.’ And though all public pools must . maintain specified levels of disinfectants in order to stem illnesses . caused by such contamination, Hlavsa said it may not always be enough. Pile up: 'Let's imagine 1,000 kids go to a water park. They have as much as 10 grams of feces on their rear ends. That translates to 24 pounds of poop in the water,' says the CDC's Michele Hlavsa . ‘Chlorine and other disinfectants don’t kill germs instantly,’ said Hlavsa said, adding that proper hygiene is the only to prevent the fecal contamination of pools. Hlavsa says between 20 and 80 outbreaks of disease caused by swimming pools are reported each year. In addition to the ‘fecal indicator’ bacteria, many of the pools in the study also tested positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosabacteria, a bacteria capable of giving swimmers rashes and ear infections. The study said it was unclear if the Pseudomonas aeruginosabacteria came from people or if it was introduced to the pools from the surrounding environment. It was found in 59 percent of the tested pools. Hlavsa doesn’t want to dissuade anyone from swimming. She calls it an excellent form of exercise. One she even says she’ll be doing as soon as the weather permits in Atlanta. Nonetheless, she took a hard line on the issue. ‘It is time to stop treating the swimming pool as a toilet,’ Hlavsa said. ‘Nowhere else except for the pool is it acceptable to poop in public or pee in public. In other places if we did this in public, we’d be arrested.’ Steaming mad: 'It is time to stop treating the swimming pool as a toilet,' says CDC's Michele Hlavsa .","E. coli bacteria found in 58 percent of public swimming pools .

The concept is the brain child of renowned fashion photographer Rankin and his new creative agency, and was unveiled at a star-studded event at his East London studio last night. Rankin, whose celebrity subjects have included Kate Moss, Kylie Minogue and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, created the pictures by photographing three models completely naked before illustrator Jo Bird sketched new season clothing designs on top of the prints. The models were then shot in the real pieces from the new autumn/winter collection.

"PUBLISHED: . 12:22 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:23 EST, 1 March 2013 . Nasa's Curiosity rover has developed a major computer problem on Mars. Engineers have been forced to suspend the rover's work while they attempt to restore a corrupted computer. The team said the rover had been placed in a 'safe mode' to protect it. Help! The last self portrait the rover sent back before it developed a major computer fault . The intentional swap put the rover, as anticipated, into what what engineers said was a minimal-activity precautionary status called 'safe mode.' The team is shifting the rover from safe mode to operational status over the next few days and is troubleshooting the condition that affected operations yesterday, Nasa said. The condition is related to a glitch in flash memory linked to the other, now-inactive, computer. 'We switched computers to get to a standard state from which to begin restoring routine operations,' said Richard Cook of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, project manager for the Mars Science Laboratory Project, which built and operates Curiosity. A Picasso-like self portrait of NASA's Curiosity rover was taken by its Navigation cameras, located on the now-upright mast. Curiosity carries a pair of redundant main computers in order to have a backup available if one fails. Each of the computers, A-side and B-side, also has other redundant subsystems linked to just that computer. Curiosity is now operating on its B-side, as it did during part of the flight from Earth to Mars. It operated on its A-side from before the August 2012 landing through Wednesday. 'While we are resuming operations on the B-side, we are also working to determine the best way to restore the A-side as a viable backup,' said JPL engineer Magdy Bareh, leader of the mission's anomaly resolution team. The spacecraft remained in communications at all scheduled communication windows on Wednesday, but it did not send recorded data, only current status information. The status information revealed that the computer had not switched to the usual daily 'sleep' mode when planned. Diagnostic work in a testing simulation at JPL indicates the situation involved corrupted memory at an A-side memory location used for addressing memory files. Scientific investigations by the rover have been suspended. Resumption of science investigations is anticipated within several days,' said Nasa. Earlier this week, laboratory instruments inside the rover have been analyzing portions of the first sample of rock powder ever collected from the interior of a rock on Mars.","One of the rover's two onboard computers has become corrupted .

The Queen today gave England and Australia's cricketers a treat as she turned up at Lord's to meet the batsmen and bowlers lined up ahead of today's Ashes Test match. The monarch walked out onto the cricket ground's famous pitch to greet the players, set to go head to head in the eagerly anticipated match. Wearing a sky blue dress with neat white jacket with contrasting trim, the Queen topped off the elegant ensemble with a statement bonnet in a vivid blue. The . famous ground is the home of cricket and is owned by Marylebone Cricket . Club (MCC) - the guardians of the laws and spirit of the game. Smiling: The Queen looked to be enjoying the tour of the famous cricket ground - which she visited after travelling back from a tour of Kendal in Cumbria this morning . Elegant: The Queen wore a bright blue straw hat for the occasion - appropriate given the temperatures in London were forecast to reach 30c . It will celebrate its bicentenary next year after being established by cricketer and businessman Thomas Lord in 1814. As the last of the sell-out crowds . took their seats for the second Test, England captain Alistair Cook . introduced the Queen to his players. Among the team were the leading . performers of the first Test at Trent Bridge which England won - bowler . Jimmy Anderson, who took the last wicket in a nailbiting finish, and . batsman Ian Bell, who scored a century. The tourists were 15 runs from victory when their last player was dismissed by the home side . But Australian have discovered their own star in 19-year-old spinner . Ashton Agar, who made 98 runs on his Test debut, the highest Test score . by a number 11 batsman. Going . solo: The Queen usually makes her traditional visit to Lord's during . the Ashes with keen cricket fan Prince Philip, but as he is currently . convalescing at Windsor she went alone . The Queen got to grips with cricket’s controversial new system for deciding if players are out or not - thanks to the England women’s captain. Charlotte Edwards found herself explaining to the Queen the hotly disputed decision review system (DRS) when the monarch visited Lord’s cricket ground in central London to watch the second Ashes Test. With keen cricket fan the Duke of Edinburgh convalescing at Windsor Castle after his recent operation, the Queen had made her traditional trip to meet the teams alone. When she last attended an Ashes test at Lord’s in 2009 two quick Australian wickets fell and later the Aussies suffered a batting collapse. But this time England were the side losing wickets - three in around 15 minutes including the captain Alastair Cook. Smiles: The Queen met the players before start of play of the second Ashes test match between England and Australia . Former Australian prime minister John Howard was sat next to the Queen in the pavilion and he could not contain his excitement when Cook’s wicket fell and clapped enthusiastically. When England batsman Joe Root was given out leg before wicket the decision was referred to a third umpire behind the scenes who used technology to check the decision. The England women’s captain talked the Queen through what was happening as images showing the heat marks left by the ball on the batsman’s bat and were screened for the sell out crowds. The sportswoman, who in a few weeks will lead her players against Australia in the women’s Ashes series, said: “I was trying to explain the DRS and I think she understood it. 'I was telling her if the ball hits the pad first its out, even if the ball goes on to hit the bat. Respect: The Queen shakes hands with England's Kevin Pietersen at Lord's Cricket Ground, London . 'Having her here makes it an extra special day, the excitement around the ground this morning grew when she arrived.' Philip’s absence was missed by senior figures from the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) - the guardians of the laws and spirit of the game - which owns Lord’s. But the Duke appears to be making good progress after last month’s exploratory abdominal surgery as Buckingham Palace said he would travel from Windsor Castle to join the Queen in Scotland during August. The Queen will be travelling to Balmoral for her traditional summer break next week but it is not thought Philip will be among her party. When the Queen first arrived at Lord’s she met the players on the pitch chatting briefly to the two sides. The famous ground is the home of cricket and will celebrate its bi-centenary next year after being established by cricketer and businessman Thomas Lord in 1814. The Queen, the MCC’s patron, met senior officials from the world of cricket in the pavilion’s committee room before settling down to watch some of the morning’s play. Her trip was hosted by MCC president Mike Griffith, who regretted that Philip could not make the visit. He said: 'It’s a shame the Duke could not be here, I guess he’s watching it at home.'He was our president twice, first in 1949 and then in 1974 but it’s wonderful to have the Queen here.' It was a busy day for the monarch, . who had earlier paid a visit to the Cumbrian town of Kendal where she . was met by thousands of well-wishers lining the streets in the sunshine.

Doctors in Scotland have been alerted to the strain, named ribotype 332, which has been reported for the first time by Health Protection Scotland (HPS). HPS said two patients being cared for at the same hospital died - one in December and the second in January. A third patient within the same health board area died last month. All were seriously ill with underlying conditions. Doctors in Scotland have been alerted to the new strain of clostridium difficile, named ribotype 332 . HPS did not disclose the hospital locations due to patient confidentiality. A statement said: 'All three cases were severely ill due to other underlying conditions and died following their episode of CDI (Clostridium difficile infection). 'This is the first published report of C difficile PCR ribotype 332 in the UK and worldwide. The report said: 'All three cases were severely ill due to other . underlying conditions and died following their episode of CDI (C . difficile infection). 'HPS has alerted clinicians and laboratory staff throughout Scotland. 'The identification of a novel ribotype does not require any immediate changes to surveillance or in the antibiotics used to treat CDI.' A CDI is a type of bacterial infection that can affect the digestive system. It most commonly affects people who are staying in hospital. Symptoms include diarrhoea and abdominal cramps and it can also cause life-threatening complications such as severe swelling of the bowel. Two of the patients who died were cared for at the same hospital, while the third patient was being treated nearby. All were seriously ill with underlying conditions (file picture) HPS said new ribotypes have emerged 'frequently' over the last decade. A ribotype is the pattern of DNA fragments particular to a bacterial strain. Ribotyping is the name given to the process of identifying this pattern which allows scientists to differentiate between different strains. Camilla Wiuff, strategic lead for microbiology at HPS, said the cases were not classed as an outbreak because the third case had not been linked to the first two. She told The Scotsman: 'But it is an interesting finding that we have this same ribotype and we are doing further investigations to see if there are more patients with this ribotype.' Past samples are now being re-examined to see if the 332 strain could be present and may have been missed. She said the 332 strain had occurred on one occasion previously somewhere in Europe, but this had not been the subject of an official report.“It is quite a common event that new strains develop all the time. It is a natural evolution of genetics in the bacteria,” she added.","The new strain, named ribotype 332, has been reported for the first time by Health Protection Scotland .

It was landed by angler Andrew Griffith, from Canterbury in Kent, alongside Hollywood actor  Julian Lewis Jones, who starred with Matt Damon in Invictus, directed by Clint Eastwood. Mr Lewis Jones, who joined Mr Griffith and skipper Andrew Alsop, while on holiday in Pembrokeshire, described the catch as something 'you dream of'. The world's fastest shark has been caught off British coast by actor actor Julian Lewis Jones. Julian is pictured here on the right with friends . The actor, 44, said: 'We saw this flash that whizzed passed the boat - it was a big white belly and it went so, so fast. 'Next thing this shark leapt 15ft in the air off the back of the stern of the boat. 'We all looked at each other and said: 'That's a mako' and we knew the importance of it. 'This is something that you dream of.' He was fishing with friends 30 miles off Milford Haven, West Wales, when he landed the mako - officially described as the fastest species of shark in the ocean.

Mr Lewis Jones, who has appeared on angling programmes on Sky TV and Welsh-language channel S4C, said the team all worked together to bring the shark in. He said: 'Mako sharks are aggressive and fast animals and they have been known to actually jump inside boats. 'It was around 40 minutes before we had him on the side of the boat and he went a bit ballistic and you can't control it - it's a wild animal, it's like trying to control a rhino. 'We were so privileged, absolutely stoked to have done it and it was the first off the coast of Wales.' The four men managed to slip a circle hook into the corner of the shark's mouth and get him to the deck of the boat. The shark weighed in at around 200lbs (90kg) and measured around 6ft (2m). The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) has recorded 42 mako attacks on humans between 1980 and 2010, three of which were fatal, along with twenty boat attacks. The last time a mako shark was reported to have been caught in Britain was in June 1971 off Looe, Cornwall. The organisation says divers who have encountered makos say that, prior to an attack, they will swim in a figure-of-eight pattern and approach with mouths open.","The  6ft-long mako shark can reach speeds of 46mphand leap 30ft .

A Christian chaplain stationed at a military base in Alaska has been censored for posting an article on the site’s website that an organization fighting for soldiers right to religious freedom has described as 'bigoted.' Air Force Lt. Col. Kenneth Reyes, who serves at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, wrote an article entitled, ‘No Atheists in Foxholes: Chaplains Gave All in World War II’ for his regular ‘Chaplain’s Corner’ column. The title referenced a famous 1954 speech by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who said: ‘I am delighted that our veterans are sponsoring a movement to increase our awareness of God in our daily lives. In battle, they learned a great truth - that there are no atheists in the foxholes.’ The Military Religious Freedom Foundation, run by Michael Weinstein, left, is calling for Lt. Col. Kenneth Reyes, right, to be disciplined for his 'anti-secular diatribe' Just five hours after the article was posted, it was taken down following complaints from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF), reports Fox News. It describes itself as a ‘civil rights organization’ whose goal is to 'ensure that members of the United States Armed Forces receive the Constitutional guarantee of religious freedom to which they are entitled by virtue of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.’ The organization contacted the base commander, Col. Brian Duffy, on behalf of its 42 members stationed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson and demanding he take action Reyes’ 'anti-secular diatribe.' The MRFF claimed Lt. Col. Reyes violated military regulation AFI 1-1, section 2.11 which requires 'Leaders at all levels must...avoid the actual or apparent use of their position to promote their personal religious beliefs to their subordinates...' 'No Atheists in Foxholes': The title of Reyes' article was a reference to a famous remark made in a 1954 speech by President Eisenhower . In a letter to Duffy the organization accused Lt. Col. Reyes of using a 'bigoted, religious supremacist phrase' which  'defiles the dignity of service members.' Now the MRFF, which is run by Michael Weinstein, is also demanding that the chaplain should be disciplined. ‘Faith based hate is hate all the same,’ the group said in the letter. ‘Lt. Col.

NYPD cold case detectives are seeking help from the public to identify the little girl dubbed 'Baby Hope' whose body was found inside a cooler off the Henry Hudson Parkway in 1991. On Tuesday, the 22nd anniversary of the unsolved crime, police circulated the neighborhood around Dyckman Street in Washington Heights near the wooded area where the child was found, speaking to residents and offering a $12,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction. The discovery by highway workers of a little girl, believed to be between . three and five years old, tied with rope . and squeezed into a picnic cooler beneath full cans of Coca-Cola struck a nerve with police and residents alike. Missing: Police were handing out this poster on Tuesday featuring images relating to the Baby Hope case. The first picture is a current, age-progression sketch of Baby Hope, the second is the sketch released in 1991, and the third photo is of the cooler which the child was found inside . Write caption he . Grisly discovery: The cooler containing Baby Hope was found in Washington Heights, on an embankment off the Henry Hudson Parkway . She had been malnourished and tests showed she had endured sexual abuse and she died of asphyxia. She was naked except for a hair-tie with yellow plastic baubles on it. She had black hair and was white, possibly Hispanic. The child was badly decomposed, making . her facial features unrecognizable, and no one came forward to claim . her. No one had filed a missing persons report and there were very few . clues. Hopeful: Locals examine a poster put up by police in the area where Baby Hope was found . Outpouring: (left) The gravesite of Baby Hope, paid for by the NYPD's 34th Precinct and (right) a sketch of what Baby Hope may have looked like . Even for hardened New York City cops, the case was a sad and grisly one. Detectives named the girl 'Baby Hope', in the hope that someone would come forward and help them find out who she was and what happened to her. Two years after her discovery, Baby Hope was buried in St Hamond's ceremony. The police of the 34th Precinct pooled their money and paid for her gravestone. She was buried in a white communion dress. Years passed, and still no one came forward. In 2007, Baby Hope's body was exhumed to try and extract a DNA sample, but her bones were in such bad condition it was impossible. A second attempt in 2011, using improved technology yielded a complete DNA profile, and police immediately ran a check on all their convicted felon and missing persons databases but came up empty-handed. Changing neighborhood: Washington Heights has one of the lowest crime rates in Manhattan, but in the '80s and early '90s, when Baby Hope was killed, the area was deeply affected by a crack cocaine epidemic and gang activity . On Tuesday, police made their latest attempt to close the case of Baby Hope. Police handed out fliers all day, and according to The New York Times, a Police Department Crime Stoppers van drove around the neighborhood equipped with a loud speaker broadcasting a request for help in both English and Spanish. 'It's hard for me to believe that nobody knows who she is,' Detective Joseph Neenan told The New York Times in 1991. The officer in charge of the case, he was accustomed to searching for missing persons. 'We have the opposite,' he said. 'We have her. We don't know who she is.' Hope: Police canvass the neighborhood in Washington Heights where the little girl's body was found 22 years ago . Now, 22 years later, Detective Robert Dewhurst echoes him: . 'I feel somebody knows who this girl was,' he told the New York Daily News. Perhaps Baby Hope 'had little girlfriends that are grown now and know something wasn’t right on the block when she was gone.' 'Everything about this case is already out there,' Sergeant Carlos Nieves, a police spokesman, told The New York Times. “They’re hoping that somebody who hasn’t come out sees this.' At the time of Baby Hope's death in 1991, Washington Heights was in the thrall of a crack cocaine epidemic and the area was known for gangs and violence. Now, it has one of the lowest crime rates in Manhattan and families with young children walk the streets with impunity. There are a lot of new faces, but police are optimistic that some of the older members of the community remember the case of Baby Hope.","Police are seeking new information in the case of a child found dead in a picnic cooler in a Manhattan park .

A choirmaster who sexually abused a vulnerable young pupil will be released in less than three years. Michael Brewer, 68, was yesterday jailed for six years for indecently assaulting Frances Andrade more than three decades ago. Mrs Andrade, a 48-year-old mother of four, killed herself days after being subjected to a torrid cross-examination during the trial of Brewer and his ex-wife, Kay. But despite branding Brewer ‘a predatory sex offender’ who subjected Mrs Andrade to ‘depraved’ and sometimes daily abuse when she was 14 and 15, Judge Martin Rudland said he could not impose a longer sentence. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Michael Brewer, 68, left, was convicted last month of indecently assaulting Frances Andrade, 48, when she was a student at Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester. His ex-wife Kay, right, was also jailed . Frances Andrade took her own life after giving evidence against Brewer . Afterwards Brewer, who worked on the BBC series Last Choir Standing and received the OBE, gave a thin smile to relatives in court. Mrs Andrade had complained about him smiling as she gave testimony. Brewer was convicted of five counts of indecent assault, an offence which can today carry up to ten years in jail. But judges must impose sentences according to the law when the offences took place. In 1980, the maximum sentence for indecent assault was two years’ imprisonment for each count. Judge Rudland said he could not take Mrs Andrade’s suicide into account, but did impose consecutive sentences to reflect the overall term a defendant would receive under current guidelines. Brewer will serve half his sentence. His ex-wife Kay, also 68, was jailed for 21 months for one count of indecent assault. The judge said she had tried to hide her crimes beneath ‘a cloak of Christian respectability’. Police are understood to have spoken to ‘dozens’ of former pupils who may also have been abused at world-renowned Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester, where Brewer was director of music. Sentencing, the judge questioned the eagerness of musical figures to back Brewer at his trial, saying his  behaviour had for too long been accepted by ‘those who should know better’. Afterwards, Mrs Andrade’s 21-year-old son, Olly, said: ‘We were very happy with the statements made by the judge. He had a good grasp of the situation and made a very fair judgment.’ He added that the sentences had been ‘longer than many were expecting’, especially for Brewer. After his mother’s death at her home in Guildford, Surrey, on January 24, he had condemned the way she was treated in court, and criticised the lack of support from police. Locked up: Michael Brewer, 68, and Kay, right, are pictured at a previous hearing . He was in court yesterday along with his father, Mrs Andrade’s 59-year-old widower Levine. Brewer’s barrister Kate Blackwell QC said ‘he bears the burden of responsibility in the sense that he failed her while she was in his care’, but said he continued to deny the abuse. Mrs Andrade, then Frances Shorney, won a scholarship to Chetham’s as a 14-year-old violin prodigy in 1978. There, she was groomed by Brewer with compliments and flattery. Hugs and kisses moved on to sex acts committed in his office at the school or in his camper van. At 18, Mrs Brewer subjected her to a horrific sexual ordeal at the couple’s home in Manchester, although her then husband was cleared of rape over the same incident. Cover-up? Detectives have received more than 20 complaints about historic sexual abuse at Chetham's, pictured . In 2011, a friend in whom Mrs Andrade had confided passed the abuse allegations on to police, and she reluctantly agreed to testify. Judge Martin Rudland told Brewer: ‘You were, and you may still be, a predatory sex offender. Of that let  no one be in any doubt.’ He condemned the choirmaster for taking advantage of the young Mrs Andrade’s desire to be ‘cherished by a loving family’ in a ‘manipulative and depraved’ way and ‘treating her as your sexual plaything’. Brewer, of Birmingham, smiled at his daughters and second wife Sandra as he was led from the dock. Mrs Brewer, of Rossendale, Lancashire, gave no reaction.","Michael Brewer, 68, indecently assaulted Frances Andrade, 48 .

Yesterday . Allen was cleared of murder but convicted of four counts of . manslaughter and told he faced ‘a substantial prison sentence’. As . the verdicts were read out, members of Miss Smith’s family shouted . ‘Yes!’, but a woman believed to be Allen’s mother called out: ‘It’s all . her fault.

Firefighters outside the house where the three children and a teenager . were killed in January last year the morning after the fatal blaze . She . had been celebrating her birthday at her home in Freckleton, . Lancashire, in January last year, Allen’s trial was told. Members of the . group spent the afternoon drinking and smoking cannabis, Neil Flewitt . QC told Preston Crown Court. ‘As a result, the recollection of most of . the witnesses is affected, by some extent, by drink and in some cases by . drugs in the form of cannabis,’ he said. Allen, a mechanic, was a friend of the family and kept some belongings in the younger children’s room after staying at the house.

Miss Smith was alerted by Allen running downstairs shouting ‘Fire!’, at which Reece went to try to rescue his siblings. Smoke alarms had been fitted on the stairs, but Reece had taken them down in the days before the fire because one or both ‘kept making beeping noises’. Allen denied starting the fire, saying he was looking for a friend upstairs when he noticed an ‘orange glow’ under the door. But police were immediately suspicious, knowing he had been the only adult upstairs at the time. An expert told the trial the fire had probably been started by clothes in the wardrobe being set alight. It emerged that Allen had set fires as a schoolboy and was known to police. A friend told the trial how the pair would regularly start fires. Trial judge Mr Justice Males remanded Allen in custody, telling him that a ‘substantial prison sentence is inevitable’.

Many are so stunning that they often parade topless, inside the store or on the pavement outside . ‘Defender of Rights’ has now launched an independent probe which, if their case is proved, could see legal action taken against Abercrombie and Fitch. Spokesman Dominique Baudis said that solely employing handsome people not only discriminates against the aesthetically-challenged, but sent out the wrong message to those buying Abercrombie & Fitch’s products. ‘While essential and decisive professional requirements can justify taking physical appearance into account when recruiting models, it is different for sales positions,’ said Mr Baudis.

When the fashion chain, Abercrombie & Fitch launched their flagship store on Savile Row, it headhunted in colleges and clubs for staff .

We don't market to anyone other than that,’ Mr Baudis said in an interview in 2006. Calling all thin people: Abercrombie & Fitch, which only employs 'good looking people' and doesn't make women's sizes above large, was accused of purposefully excluding plus-sized customers . Mr Baudis was at the centre of another stir earlier this year when Robin Lewis, author of ‘The New Rules of Retail’, said Jeffries ‘doesn’t want larger people shopping in his store’.

The  three-year-old girl at the centre of a South Carolina . adoption dispute because of her Native American history is just two percent Cherokee, it has been revealed. Her biological mother Christy Maldonado is Hispanic and was . unmarried when she got pregnant and gave birth to Veronica - since then she has worked closely with a non-Indian . couple hopeful of adopting her daughter. But when Veronica's biological father, Dusten . Brown, found out he secured custody based on his Cherokee Nation ancestry . and the couple who  looked after the girl from birth until 19 months ago were forced to hand her over. Brown pictured with his daughter Veronica on Monday. She is set to be returned to her adoptive parents . Yesterday it was revealed that Christy Maldonado is suing the federal government, saying a law governing . the placement of Indian children is unconstitutional. In her lawsuit, filed Wednesday in . federal court in South Carolina, Christy Maldonado asks U.S. Attorney . General Eric Holder for a declaration that parts of the Indian Child . Welfare Act are illegal. Those measures – which include a . preference for 'other Indian families' over prospective non-Indian . adoptive parents – should be nixed because the law uses race in . determining with whom a child should live and therefore violates equal . protection provisions, Maldonado argues. The act was passed in 1978 to reduce . the number of Indian children being removed from their homes by public . and private agencies and placed with non-Indian families. Matt and Melanie Capobianco were in the delivery room when Veronica was born in Oklahoma in 2009 . The law, Maldonado said in the . lawsuit, was enacted with good intentions but ended up 'sweeping within . it children who do not have, and would not have – but for ICWA – any . connection whatsoever to any Tribe other than biology ... and . irrespective of whether their sole custodial birth mothers – their only . legal parents – have even a trace of Indian blood.' Maldonado's lawsuit includes 10 . unnamed plaintiffs who are also unmarried mothers of children of Indian . heritage who, because of the federal law, fear the adoptions of their . children won't be finalized because the prospective parents are . non-Indians, according to court documents. Maldonado's lawsuit also names the . Cherokee Nation as a defendant. Spokeswomen for both the nation and the . federal government did not immediately comment on the lawsuit. Native American tribes across the U.S. see the case as a test of tribal sovereignty which could set a precedent for other adoptions . Veronica, her biological father Dusten Brown, feed their geese and ducks at his home in Oklahoma where she has lived for the past 19 months . In the middle: Veronica has been caught in an ongoing tug of war custody battle for most of her young life . 'I'm always going to be her daddy': Dusten Brown and daughter Veronica met for the first time on New Year's Eve 2011 . A Charleston-area couple has been . trying to adopt Maldonado's daughter since the girl's birth. Veronica . lived with Matt and Melanie Capobianco for the first two years of her . life but has been with her biological father since 2011, when the South . Carolina Supreme Court ruled that, because of the federal law, Dusten . Brown should have preference because of his Cherokee heritage. A . member of the Cherokee Nation, Brown had never met his daughter and, . after the girl's non-Indian mother rebuffed his marriage proposal, . played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after the . girl was born. But . when Brown found out Veronica was going to be adopted, he objected and . said the law favored the girl living with him and growing up learning . tribal traditions. The Capobiancos appealed that . decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled this year that federal . law did not actually require that Veronica be given back to her Cherokee father. But the ruling didn't directly award . the girl to the Capobiancos, instead leaving it to South Carolina courts . to decide where Veronica should end up. Last week, the state Supreme Court . ordered a family court to finalize the Capobiancos' adoption of the . girl, a decision that court upheld Wednesday. No formal transition timetable has . been set. Brown is also pursuing custody of her in Oklahoma, and his . parents also are seeking guardianship through the Cherokee court system . Several American Indian groups have said they plan to file their own federal lawsuit to protect Veronica's interests.","Veronica's mother was working with non-Indian couple to adopt young girl .

It was perhaps the most costliest skipping of the gym in history. NFL cornerback Tarell Brown has forfeited $2million of his base salary after he failed to attend his team's voluntary off-season workouts. By not reading the small print, the San Fransisco 49ers player lost the cash because he did not turn up to exercise with the rest of the team - and he has now fired his agent over the costly blunder. Brown, 28, said he normally trains alone in his home state of Texas; but did not realize that by working out there instead of in California, his salary would plunge to $925,000. The detail in the contract stated that the off-season workouts would have triggered an escalator in his deal, Larry Brown Sports reported. But the athlete said he was unaware of the clause, and only discovered his error when he read a Yahoo article about it on Twitter yesterday. The cornerback, who played college football for the University of Texas, immediately fired his agent, Brian Overstreet, ESPN reported. Brown explained his decision to fire his agent, saying that it was Overstreet's responsibility to inform the player about details in his contract, the San Fransisco Gate reported. 'That's what agents get paid to do – to orchestrate the contract and let you know what you can and can’t do as far as workouts, OTAs, things of that sort,' Brown said. 'That’s what he got paid to do. He didn’t do that. So, in my opinion, you have to be let go. 'We all are held accountable for our actions and it’s just part of the business.' Should have come to California: Because the athlete was working out in Texas, he missed out on a clause which would have triggered a pay increase . Brown (right) said he didn't know about that clause in the deal and only learned of it via Twitter . Overstreet was unavailable to comment when the Mail Online tried to contact him. Brown said he had no problem with working out, but had routinely returned home to prepare himself for the next season, ESPN reported. 'It's something I've always done as far as off-season at home and training and getting myself in shape. 'It had nothing to do with not being in shape, not wanting to work out, no contract problems, it just had to do with me wanting to go back home and train. 'It's something I've been doing for the past few years.' He had been set to earn $2.925 million this season in base salary after signing a three-year, $7.125 million extension in 2009. The 49ers selected Brown in the fifth round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He is involved in two foundations to help others. One is the 'Brown's Kids Foundation', which aims to improve the quality of life for disadvantaged youth while creating an environment of care and support in areas of education, reduction of poverty and disparity. The other the 'Born Again Foundation', which strives the to restore the lives of ex-offenders returning to society, and provide preventative methods to reduce recidivism of ex-offenders, by offering them alternative solutions and a chance at independence and self-sufficiency by 'making a positive transition to a new life.'","Tarell Brown lost $2million because he did not attend workout .
