The CIA's acting director has sent out a scathing public deploration of film Zero Dark Thirty to his entire staff after watching what he calls entertaining historical inaccuracies in its portrayal of the raid of Osama bin Laden's compound. Billed as 'the story of history's greatest manhunt for the world's most dangerous man' by using firsthand accounts, the film recounts U.S. troops' top secret mission while highlighting the first hours of May 1st of 2011. 'I would not normally comment on a Hollywood film, but I think it's important to put Zero Dark Thirty which deals with one of the most significant achievements in our history, into some context,' Mike Morell began in his note to his staff on Friday. Scroll down to read the full statement . Hollywood portrayal: Actress Jessica Chastain is seen in a scene from new film Zero Dark Thirty which has been most recently criticized by acting CIA director Mike Morell for historical inaccuracies . Not a fan: Acting CIA Director Michael Morell lambasted the film in a public statement to his employees on Friday claiming it doesn't fairly portray what really happened in 2011 or the decade of work beforehand . Mr Morell accuses the film as being overwhelmingly misleading in its timeline, depiction of CIA personnel and their actions, as well as its shown use of torture to generate information. 'What I want you to know is that Zero Dark Thirty is a dramatization, not a realistic portrayal of the facts,' he begins. Among three points, Mr Morell argues the hunt for bin Laden having been a group effort of hundreds of officers over a decade, contrasting the Hollywood film attributing it to, as he writes, 'just a few individuals.' In the film written by screenwriter Mark Boal, the mission’s leading intelligence operative is played by Jessica Chastain who is largely credited in the film for finding bin Laden’s secret compound in Abbottabad, Afghanistan. 'This may make for more compelling entertainment, but it does not reflect the facts,' he writes. 'Second,' he begins, 'the film creates the strong impression that the enhanced interrogation techniques that were part of our former detention and interrogation program were the key to finding Bin Ladin. That impression is false.' He argues multiple sources outside of a primary use of 'enhanced interrogation' - the CIA's popular chosen description of torture - in finding bin Laden. Hot and cold: The film, one scene pictured, has since been nominated for four Golden Globes despite mutually searing criticism from Washington . 'Some came from detainees subjected to enhanced techniques, but there were many other sources as well,' he wrote. 'Third, the film takes considerable liberties in its depiction of CIA personnel and their actions, including some who died while serving our country. We cannot allow a Hollywood film to cloud our memory of them,' he concluded. ‘CIA interacted with the filmmakers through our Office of Public Affairs but, as is true with any entertainment project with which we interact, we do not control the final product.' The film that’s currently playing in select theatres before its full release in January has been since nominated for four Golden Globe awards. But critics arguing its factuality, like Mr Morell, have come from the nation’s top politicians as well. Last week Senators Diane Feinstein, Carl Levin and John McCain wrote a letter to Sony Picture chairman and CEO Michael Lynthon accusing it as being 'factually inaccurate.' The three asked for a disclaimer before . the film on its accuracies, contrasting its current reading:  ‘based on . firsthand accounts of actual events.’ Criticisms: Among Mr Morell's complaints of the film, pictured, are its depiction of torture used by U.S. troops to gain information and the mission's credit given to a select number of people . Like Mr Morell, they also target the film's shown use of torture. 'Zero Dark Thirty is factually inaccurate, and we believe that you have an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Usama Bin Laden is not based on the facts, but rather part of the film's fictional narrative,' they wrote. Feinstein is chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the group who will oversee President Obama's selection of CIA director which Morell is considered a top candidate for. Earlier this month the film's screenwriter Mark Boal defended his work to the New York Times, expressing the complexity in cramming such a timeline of events into a film of approximately two and a half hours. 'I’m trying to compress a program that lasted for years into a few short scenes,' he said, adding that it also aims 'to reflect a very complex debate about torture that is still going on.' Mr Boal and director Kathryn Bigelow have previously defended it as a film not intended to withstand nit-picking historians. Statement to Employees from Acting Director Michael Morell: ""Zero Dark . Thirty"" December 21, 2012 . I would not normally comment on a Hollywood film, but I think it important to . put Zero Dark Thirty, which deals with one of the most significant . achievements in our history, into some context.  The film, which premiered this . week, addresses the successful hunt for Usama Bin Ladin that was the focus of . incredibly dedicated men and women across our Agency, Intelligence Community, . and military partners for many years.  But in doing so, the film takes . significant artistic license, while portraying itself as being historically . accurate.

Commentators will have much to say about this film in the weeks ahead.

An Australian billionaire has announced plans to build a replica of the Titanic that will make its maiden voyage from England to New York in 2016. Weeks after the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the cruise liner, Clive Palmer said he had signed a memorandum of understanding with state-owned Chinese company CSC Jinling Shipyard to build the Titanic II. Mr Palmer said: 'It will be every bit as luxurious as the original Titanic, but... will have state-of-the-art 21st-century technology and the latest navigation and safety systems.' 'Tribute': Australian billionaire mining magnate Clive Palmer poses in front of Titanic II, a full-size replica he is planning to build after striking a deal with Chinese boatbuilders . Doomed: Titanic leaves Southampton on her ill-fated journey across the Atlantic on April 10, 1912. Mr Palmer says his version of the cruise liner will have the very latest in navigation and safety technology . He called the project 'a tribute to the spirit of the men and women who worked on the original Titanic.' More than 1,500 people died after the Titanic hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic on its first voyage in 1912. Before it set sail, it was heralded as the world's largest, most luxurious and safest ocean liner. Various events were held to mark the anniversary earlier this month, including a memorial cruise which carried more than 1,500 passengers, some of whom had direct links with the doomed liner, to the very spot where it sank. Sailing into history: Mr Palmer hopes Titanic II will make its maiden voyage from England to New York, as the original did, in 2016 . A service took place at the very time it went under. Palmer built a fortune on real estate on Australia's Gold Coast tourist strip before becoming a coal mining magnate. BRW . magazine reported he was Australia's fifth-richest person last year . with an estimated fortune of more than AUS$5billion (£3.2billion). Palmer . said at a press conference that previous attempts to build a Titanic . replica failed because proponents failed to raise enough money and . commission a shipyard. Poignant: Passengers take part in the Titanic memorial service 100 years after the disaster at the site where it sunk in the North Atlantic. About 50 of the 1,309 passengers on board have a direct link with the doomed liner . Legacy: Alex Aaronson, six, from north America, whose relative Artie Frost, 38, perished on the Titanic, in the new memorial garden at Belfast City Hall on the 100th anniversary of the ship sinking . The Titanic II is the first of four luxury cruise ships Palmer has commissioned CSC Jinling Shipyard to build. Palmer did not provide a cost estimate. He said he had established a new shipping company, Blue Star Line Pty. Ltd., and that design work for the Titanic II has begun with assistance from a historical research team. The diesel-powered ship will have four smoke stacks like the coal-powered original, but they will be purely decorative. The most obvious changes from the original Titanic would be below the water line, including welding rather than rivets, a bulbous bow for greater fuel efficiency and enlarged rudder and bow thrusters for increased maneuverability, Palmer said.","Mining magnate Clive Palmer signs deal with Chinese to build Titanic II .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:39 EST, 18 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:08 EST, 18 December 2012 . Two convicted bank robbers have escaped a federal prison using knotted bedsheets high above downtown Chicago on early Tuesday, one week after one of them made a courtroom vow of retribution. The escape that left the 'rope' dangling from a Metropolitan Correctional Center's window occurred sometime between 5 am and 8.45am when Chicago Police Sgt. Mark Lazarro says the inmates were discovered missing. Hours later, the escape mechanism was spotted approximately 20 stories above the ground with Joseph 'Jose' Banks, 37, and Kenneth Conley, 38, gone. MacGyvering: A rope made out of knotted bedsheets is seen hanging out of a window 20-stories above the ground as the inmates' method of escape . Great escape: Crime scene tape surrounds the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center after guards discovered the two men missing from a window 20-stories high . On the run: From left, Joseph 'Jose' Banks, 37, and Kenneth Conley, 38, are on the run after breaking from the correctional center between 5am and 8.45 this morning . Both men had been wearing prison-issue orange jumpsuits, but now might be wearing white t-shirts, gray sweat pants and white gym shoes, Lazarro said. The FBI said the men were last seen together in the Tinley Park area, about 25 miles southwest of Chicago, and that they should be considered armed and dangerous. SWAT teams stormed a Tinley Park home early Tuesday afternoon, but the escapees were not there, FBI Special Agent Frank Bochte said. He said there was evidence the two had been there earlier, and authorities were using dogs and helicopters to search various places in the Chicago area where the two had connections. Banks is described as a black man, 5-feet-8, weighing 160 pounds. Conley is described as white, 6 feet tall, weighing 185 pounds. Other looks: Conley is seen in another booking photo, right, taken in early 2011 without his hair . Cat and mouse: Police search a parking structure attached to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center with the help of a K9 . Bandits: Banks was convicted last week of two bank robberies and two attempted robberies where he made off with a nearly $600,000, $500,000 of which is still unaccounted for . Something in common: Conley was convicted of robbing nearly $4,000 from a bank last year before meeting Banks . The men apparently descended from a . thin window barely half a foot wide on the flat south side of the prison . into the alley below. The wall faces a parking garage and is above air . conditioning or heating units. Crowds . of people gathered outside the building where the ropes still blew in . the breeze, shaking their heads in disbelief that someone could have . escaped from a lockup in the heart of downtown Chicago, just a block or . two from key federal court and office buildings. The owners of several small shops across the street from the wall said they didn't see any police activity until around 8:30 a.m., when a dozen or more police cars and SWAT teams rushed into the area. Some police officers sprinted for a nearby subway entrance. 'It was clearly already too late. They were long gone,' said Randy Cohen, owner of the Royal Jewelry and Loans store 10 or 20 yards from where the inmates scaled down the rope. Sightings: The FBI said the men were last seen together in the Tinley Park area, about 25 miles southwest of Chicago, and that they should be considered armed and dangerous . Homeland Security and U.S. Marshal's . Service agents questioned him later in the morning and asked if security . cameras on his building could have captured the escape or the men . fleeing, Cohen said. He said he didn't think the cameras would have been . pointed in the right direction. Liquor store owner Baljit Singh has a clear view of the side of the prison where the men escaped. She said there was no indication anything was amiss when she arrived at work at 7am . The facility, which houses around 700 inmates, is one of the only skyscraper prisons in the world, said Jennifer Lucente of Chicago Architecture Foundation. Architect Harry Weese designed the building in the mid-1970s. Its triangular shape is supposed to reduce the number of blind spots for guards, Lucente said. Each cell has a window as part of the building's humane design, she said. Change of clothing: There was evidence the two had visited a Tinley Park home earlier providing them with items such as clothing that would relieve them of their orange prison suits . Surprise visit: Word of the inmates' visit to this Tinley Park home belonging to a family member of one of the men sent television news crews outside in hopes of catching its owner . Security concerns have arisen before about the lockup. Last year, federal authorities opposed a request from attorneys for Mexican drug-cartel lieutenant Vincente Zambada — held there on trafficking charges — to let him out on the rooftop recreational area, where in the summer inmates can be seen playing basketball. Officials feared snipers could target Zambada or that he might try a daring escape from atop the 27-story building. He was later moved to a lockup in Michigan. In 2010, the brother of Hollywood director Christopher Nolan was sentenced to 14 months for plotting to escape from the facility by hiding a rope made out of bed sheets in his cell. Matthew Nolan, who was being held pending an extradition request, pleaded guilty to possessing contraband in jail and obstruction of justice. On camera: Seen here in May of 2011, Conley was charged with robbing MB Financial in Homewood, Illinois . Banks, known as the Second-Hand Bandit because he wore used clothes during his heists, was convicted last week of robbing two banks and attempting to rob two more. Authorities say he stole almost $600,000 and that most of that is still missing. After U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer convicted him, he said he would 'be seeking retribution as well as damages,' the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune reported. When the judge asked how long he needed to submit a filing, Banks replied, 'No motion will be filed, but you'll hear from me.' Conley pleaded guilty last October to robbing a Homewood Bank of nearly $4,000.","Police say Joseph 'Jose' Banks, 37, and Kenneth Conley, 38, might be wearing white t-shirts, gray sweat pants and white gym shoes .

'He's making a list, he's checking it twice, he's going to find out who's been naughty or nice' goes the popular Christmas song. But Santa Claus has come to a Canadian town with a difference this Christmas - he's armed with an automatic weapon and wearing a bullet proof police vest. Abbotsford Police Department in British Columbia, Canada, has sent this rather unorthodox seasonal greeting to everyone on its own naughty list this Christmas. Scroll down for video . Seasons greetings: The not-so-festive warning sent to criminals by a Canadian police force . The force has sent the card to all known prolific offenders, gang members and drug dealers in a bid to get them to make it their New Year resolution to change their criminal ways. The card, sent out as part of Operation Resolution, features the force's Police Chief Bob Rich dressed as Father Christmas in tactical gear with the accompanying message 'Which list will you be on next year?' As well as the image of Santa on the card's front, the not-so-festive greeting also has a quote that says: 'You are always only one choice away from changing your life'. An additional greeting continues: 'We believe it is never too late to make a better choice for your life. Unamused: Not everyone saw the funny side of Abbotsford Police Department's seasonal greeting . 'For the sake of your family & for your own sake, consider 2013 the year you choose a new & better life. 'Make your New Year’s resolution now! We’re here to help.' For those on the naughty list that do heed the force's warning, there is a phone number they can call. Callers are urged to redial 911 in an emergency, but asked to leave their details for a call back from officers should they wish to 'make a change.' Checking his list twice: A more traditional Father Christmas image than the one on Abbotsford Police Department's card . A spokesman for the Abbotsford Police Department said: 'We realize that Operation Resolution is different. 'We wanted to do something different but to also stay true to the spirit of the holidays and the New Year. 'We sincerely believe that the holiday season is a time for reflection for many people in our community. 'A positive change can reap rewards and benefits far beyond the impact to a single individual.' But the police force may well find itself scrubbed off some people's Christmas card list with several taking offence and complaining via APD's Facebook page. Canadian Neva Lovegrove commented: 'One the picture is in poor taste and second in my opinion the money you used for this could of been better spent on the children and seniors of the town you already know the offender is only going to laugh at this.' Kelly Olson added: 'How much taxpayer money spent on this stupidity???' Some did see the funny side though, with Wayne Busilla posting: 'Bravo, it is effective, creative, a great use of very little taxpayers dollars. I for one, am impressed with this proactive approach to making our citizens safe.' The force under Chief Rich's leadership must be doing something right. It is well on its way to reaching its goal of halving crime since 2008 by 2013 and has been transformed from Canada's 'murder capital' to one of the safest big cities in the country.

He . travelled to Ukraine six times to meet her believing that they would . get married and live together in Hankamer, near Houston, Texas. But the pair fell out when Sarin discovered she was sleeping with her Russian boyfriend Ark Ovrutski. He tried to pay federal agents posing as a criminal gang $50,000 to kidnap Miss Barykina and deliver her to a specially adapted room in his home where he would get 'at least get a week out of her' before killing her with lead. Sartin pleaded guilty to attempted kidnapping and brandishing a firearm. The court heard how Sartin met Miss Barykina through dating website Dream Marriage which promised 'sexy' Russian and Ukrainian women. He said he showered Miss Barykina with $15,000 in jewelry, including a diamond wedding set, and lavish trips across Europe.

The bachelor was also transferring money after she said she wanted to get a U.S. visa so she could emigrate and join an English school. They agreed not to have sex before marriage because it is 'sacred'. But Sartin was furious when he discovered she was sleeping with her Russian boyfriend. He showered Miss Barykina, an aspiring singer, with $15,000 in jewelry, including a diamond wedding set, and lavish trips across Europe . Miss Barykina performs in a video posted on YouTube. Sartin says he gave her thousands of dollars to help her jump start a music career . Miss Barykinar was given money for a photo shoot and record productions by Sartin. The pair fell out when he relaised she had a Russian boyfriend she was sleeping with . In July last year Miss Barykina sent him an email in which she broke off the one-sided romance. She wrote: 'David...I understand how it's difficult to you to realise that I cannot be your girlfriend. 'Please understand this. I am so sorry.. I try to offer all that I can - my friendship..I cannot give you more..Sorry.' Following dozens more messages, Sartin hatched a plan to pay gangsters to kidnap Miss Barykina and have her shipped as a 'package' in a 'crate' to his home .

There are thousands of websites offering beautiful women from Russia and Ukraine seemingly desperate to find a western man. But while some of these ads are genuine pleas for love, there have been many cases of men losing their money as they try to secure their 'bride'. Letters between the two people are sent back and fourth before the 'bride' often raises the suggestion on money for plane tickets and visas. The women prey on lonely men, and once they have money they can disappear or end the relationship. The first warning sign for people using this method of internet dating is when the woman begins to ask for money. One man called Steve wrote online that the letters he was receiving from his 'bride' were actually generic ones from am agency. 'You can imagine how upset I was when I learned the truth,' he said. But the 'kidnap' agents that Sartin were dealing with were from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives. On . March 6 last year he made a $25,000 downpayment and two weeks later . went to a hardware store where he expected her to be handed over. Federal prosecutor Joe Batte said he was arrested carrying another $25,000 in an envelope, handcuffs, stungun and a pistol. A . long rant posted by Sartin on the website Internet Scam Watch says how . he 'supported' Miss Barykina 'as a good husband would do'. He added: 'During all this time from then to now I have grown to love this person with all of my heart and it was not hard. ' He also posted online several of their email and SMS conversations in which they talk about her moving to the U.S. Sartin's father Cecil, 73, said he had warned his 'lonely' son about the relationship but 'she was prettier and could talk sweeter than me.' He added that after the kidnapping plot 'in the back of his heart, I think he was still hoping they might have a life together.' Meanwhile, Sartin's wealthy ex-wife said he had received $400,000 from a divorce settlement with her. Retired oil-executive Betty Sartin, who was married to him for 11 years, said: 'I was 13 years older than him, and he played me for a fool. Now he's met somebody a little smarter than him.'","David Sartin, 49, planned to 'get a week out of her' before lead poisoning .

The answer was this 10ft festive version of the Olympic mascot Wenlock, which almost touches the ceiling of their home in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. They used 150,000 bricks – all of which must be put away in the right boxes come Twelfth Night. Standing tall: Miss Weightman with the 10ft mascot, which took 150,000 bricks and two months to build . Mr Addis, 54, and Miss Weightman, 49, spent two months building the giant Wenlock, which is the latest in a long line of creations over the past 20 years. They spent more than 70 hours constructing the giant mascot, complete with Santa costume, which is now standing in their living room. Miss Weightman said: 'We started building it in mid-October and we’ve spent at least an hour a day working on it. 'We watched the Olympics in the summer and we enjoyed it so much we decided to use the mascot for our theme this year and add a Christmas coat. 'We had a soft toy Wenlock which we used to design the model and we added an FC instead of a W on his head.' The couple and their children Tom, 20, Holly, 17 and Christopher, 14, have been building huge Lego models at Christmas for the last two decades. Early days: The family have been making Lego models each year since Tom (pictured left with sister Holly, right) was a baby, including this snowman built in 1995 . Travelled afar: Tom, left, Holly and baby Christopher with a Lego model of the Three Kings in 1999 . Over the years the models have become increasingly complex, including last year's Dalek, left, and the Nutcracker, right, built in 2005 . It's that time of year again: In 1996 the family built this Father Christmas sleigh . They started the year Tom was born and a family friend came to visit with a young child. Miss Weightman said: 'I got my old box of Lego out for the toddler to play with but the pieces were too small so the adults ended up playing instead and we built our first Christmas model.' Since then the models have got bigger each year and the family has built a Christmas stocking, a Father Christmas, an angel, a snowman, choirboys and  a giant Dalek. Hark the Herald: The family's skills had clearly developed by the time the Lego angel was built in 2006, right, and the three choirboys in 2003 . Growing up: The three children in front of the 2001 model of a German Christmas market . They now have a huge collection of Lego, much of which they have bought from eBay, and it is all stored in the cellar. Miss Weightman said: 'On the twelfth night after Christmas we invite friends round and have a packing away party as all the pieces need to go in the right boxes. 'It can take around two weeks to put all the bricks away again.'

It is a monument to Wales' proud coal-mining history, celebrating one of the world's oldest energy sources. But now the Welsh National Coal Museum is acknowledging power sources of the future - and installing solar panels. The Big Pit museum has turned to renewable energy to power its buildings in Blaenafon, south Wales. More than six per cent of Big Pit’s energy will be generated by 200 solar panels installed on the museum’s roof in a bid to reduce bills and carbon footprints, museum representatives said. Green energy: The main building of the Big Pit National Coal Museum in Wales set to be fitted with solar panels . Despite complaints from some of the ex-miners who work as guides at the museum the most common reaction to the new energy source has been positive, the Guardian reported . 'Coal is such an important part of Wales’ heritage and yet green energy will play a major part in its future,' Peter Walker, museum manager at Big Pit said. 'A solar powered coal mining museum is a fantastic way to celebrate this national journey.' Mr Walker added that the panels will also bring economic benefits to the museum in reducing energy bills. The panels are an initiative of community interest company Warm Wales, Cymru Gynnes, who said any surplus energy from the solar panels will be fed back into the national grid. ‘In . bringing together a major contributor to our Welsh heritage with new . technology we’re demonstrating to all that even the . most traditional of industries can gain substantial benefits through . integrating the old and the new,’ Warm Wales' project director Craig .

Iron-y: Visitors are taken on underground tours of the working mine by which is set to have more than six per cent of its energy provided by solar panels . Big Pit is part of National Museum Wales, Amgueddfa Cymru, who highlighted the importance of bringing old and new energy sources together in planning for the future. Mark Richards, Director of Operations and Deputy Director General for Amgueddfa Cymru, said he was ‘delighted’ to be moving towards green energy at the coal mining museum. ’As a working coal mine we are here to celebrate one of the world’s oldest energy sources and an enormously important aspect of Welsh heritage. But it is important to look to, and plan for, the future.’ The Big Pit won the Gulbenkian Prize . for Museum of the Year in 2005 for 'keeping the story of British coal . alive,' and is one of Wales most popuar tourist attractions.

The British motor industry received a new boost today as Japanese car giant Nissan announced  a £250million investment to build a brand new luxury hatchback in Sunderland –  called Infiniti. The cash boost will mean 1,000 extra UK jobs of which 280 will be directly at the plant in Tyne and Wear to build the new upmarket Infiniti Etheria car – a rival to Audi’s A3 – from 2015. About 60,000 Infiniti Etherias costing from around £20,000 will be built at the Sunderland factory each year pushing  the current 500,000 record production figure achieved this week even higher. Boost: Nissan has given the British car manufacturing industry a boost, announcing that it will be making a new hatchback called Infiniti, pictured, in Sunderland . Luxury: The £250 million investment will result in 1,000 extra UK jobs . Infiniti-ely better: A man looks at a car at the Nissan showroom in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, yesterday as the Japanese company announces the production of the new model Inifiniti . Nisan said it marked ‘the first new car brand to be manufactured in the UK on this scale in 23 years.’ The factory which employs more than 6,000 currently builds the Nisan Qashqai, Note, Juke, and starts in the New Year with production of the electric Leaf. The deal was hailed by Prime Minister David Cameron as ‘another vote of confidence for UK manufacturing’, by Nissan as ‘a milestone’, Business Secretary Vince Cable as ‘ a strong endorsement of the quality of Britain's car industry.’ The luxury Infiniti brand is to . Nissan what Lexus is to Toyota – the younger but more upwardly-mobile . premium or ‘posh’ branch of the family. The new global model will be . manufactured solely at Sunderland and is being developed with help from . Nissan's design centre in London and technical centre in Cranfield. It . will then be exported around the world, said the firm. Milestone: David Cameron called the UK production of Inifiniti a 'vote of confidence' The . North East plant will build more than half a million cars this year, . the first UK manufacturer to achieve this milestone, said Nissan: ‘By . the end of this week we anticipate making 510,000 units in 2012.’ But the deal is also the result of some internal fast-footwork by Nissan. Originally, . Sunderland was to have built a Ford-Focus sized Nissan-badged hatchback . – under a deal announced in Yokohama by Prime Minister David Cameron . during his visit to Japan in March. The . Infiniti, by contrast, was to have been built in Austria by . Magna-Steyr. Nissan bosses then decided to move the Infiniti to . Sunderland ‘because of the high quality of the workmanship’, said a . spokesman. But there wasn’t room to do both, so the Nissan hatchback is . to go elsewhere. However, the new investment is double the original . £127million. But an £8.2m taxpayer subsidy from UK Government’s Regional . Growth Fund agreed for the Nissan badged car will have to be reapplied . for under the new deal. Nissan said: ’Because of capacity . limitations at Sunderland, securing the new Infiniti will mean that a . C-segment hatchback previously announced for the plant in March will be . manufactured elsewhere. Sourcing for this vehicle will be decided and . announced at a later date.’ Colin . Dodge, Nissan's executive vice-president and chief performance officer, . said: ‘This milestone, our first premium product to be manufactured at . Sunderland, reconfirms our commitment to UK manufacturing and the . ongoing success of the plant which is moving up the value chain. ‘Just . as important, the new Infiniti, which will be exported around the . world, is being developed with help from our London design centre and . our European Technical Centre.’ Homegrown: The Inifniti is going to be built at the Nissan factory in Sunderland, pictured, adding 280 jobs directly to the plant . Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘This investment is excellent news for the North East and another vote of confidence for UK manufacturing. The continued success of Nissan in the UK demonstrates the strength of the car industry here, and its importance, as we rebalance and grow the economy.’ He added: ’This announcement shows how the car industry in partnership with the Government continues to win important long term investment projects, in a tough competitive sector; helping the UK to get ahead in the global race.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable, who will attend a ceremony in Sunderland to mark today’s announcement, said: ‘Sunderland will be the only place in the world to make this new premium compact car. ‘Nissan in the UK goes from strength to strength. Not only will the new car be made here and exported all over the world, the UK has already contributed to its design and development.’ He added: ‘Today's news is a strong endorsement of the quality of Britain's car industry which is creating jobs, taking on apprentices and contributing to building a stronger economy. The auto sector is living up to being one of the great success stories of our industrial strategy and a testimony to government and private sector working together in close partnership.’ Production started at Nissan’s Sunderland plant in September 1986 since when investment has topped more than  £3.5bn. Infiniti was launched in 1989 in the United States and in the UK and Europe from 2008.

Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith said he was looking at how a 'welfare card' would work in practice . Welfare claimants may soon be given credits on a card instead of cash to stop them buying alcohol or drugs with taxpayer money. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said yesterday: ‘For somebody who has a history of drug addiction, giving cash sometimes can lead to further problems.’ Tory backbencher Alec Shelbrooke recently suggested a Bill to stop all claimants buying anything with payments other than essentials such as food, clothing, energy, travel and housing. However, a department source stressed that Mr Duncan Smith was only discussing addicts, adding: ‘A welfare cash card for all claimants would be completely untenable and would go against everything else we are trying to do.’ In another development, Mr Duncan Smith announced yesterday that jobseekers could see benefits slashed if they fail to look for jobs three times a week on a new website. Called Universal Jobmatch, the system identifies suitable vacancies and provides advice on skills. It will be fully launched next year after a trial, with 370,000 companies already using it to advertise jobs. Online recruitment firm Monster will manage the site, which will be compulsory for jobseekers to use at the start of 2013. Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘Your CV will do . the work for you, even when you are sleeping, and notify you that a . suitable job has become available.’ He . said jobseekers would no longer have to use touch-screens in . jobcentres, or wait for a print-out of jobs which had probably already . been taken up. ‘If you . choose not to take a job that matches you, then the adviser will look at . your reasons, and if the adviser thinks “actually, these are pretty . specious reasons”, he may call you in and say “I think you really need . to be applying for these jobs”.’ Mr Duncan Smith backed the idea of benefits being added to a pre-pay card which can only be used for certain purchases. He said: ‘I’ve been looking at this process to figure out whether it’s feasible, how would it work, how does it match with legal obligations, so we’ve already been examining this. ‘I genuinely think there are some areas where we might want to think about.’ He added that one cause of concern was drug addicts using benefits to feed a habit. ‘You know, somebody who has a history of real drug addiction, giving people cash sometimes can actually lead to further problems,’ he told BBC Radio 4. It follows a move in the Commons by a backbench Tory MP to change the law to introduce a welfare card. Alec Shelbrooke said he wanted to stop state money being used for non-essential, desirable and often damaging (NEDDs) products like alcohol, cigarettes, paid-for TV channels and gambling. Mr Duncan Smith is prepared for a political battle with Labour over the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Bill, which was published today. Chancellor George Osborne claimed in the Commons the one per cent cap was to ensure fairness for those who go to work while their neighbours have their curtains drawn. But Liam Byrne, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said: ‘The Strivers’ Tax Bill is a naked attack on hard working families to pay the price for this government’s economic failure. ‘I want to bring down the welfare bill. But they way we do that is with jobs. Labour will not support a Bill that does nothing to create a single new job yet punishes those who work.’","Work and Pensions Secretary is examining how a 'welfare card' to limit how handouts are spent could work in practice .

Retailers are predicting the biggest high street shopping day in British history tomorrow with a last-minute spending spree of £3.8billion. The British Retail Consortium believes as much as £5billion could be spent over the coming two days in an unprecedented rush. Spending could reach an average of  £2.6million a minute during the 24 hours of trading tomorrow, based on estimates by the Visa card company. Spree: Experts believe as much as £5billion could be spent on the British high street over the next two days in an unprecedented rush . The spree, coupled with the predicted heavy downpours, is expected to bring gridlock to town centres and long queues at tills. The positive predictions come after retailers around the country enjoyed brisk trade today ahead of the last shopping weekend before Christmas Day. Jace Tyrrell, director of communications at the New West End Company, which represents hundreds of businesses in London's West End, said there had been a visible spike in footfall from lunchtime today. 'It was very busy from lunchtime, and heaving from 2pm, he said. 'In particular there were a lot of men out doing last-minute Christmas shopping.' Mr Tyrrell said retailers in the area were expecting customers to spend up to £100million over the coming weekend. The number of people in high streets and retail parks has been down this December compared to a  year ago, according to BRC surveys. 'In cash terms, we think Saturday will be the biggest shopping day we have ever had' Richard Dodd, British Retail Consortium . Cash-strapped families have been cutting back and playing a game of brinkmanship with retailers in the hope they will cut prices. Most national chains have buckled under the pressure by slashing prices by as much as 60 per cent or more. According to research by accountants PwC, 76 per cent of chains are now advertising sales or money-off promotions in their windows, in comparison with 69 per cent last week. The average amount of money being reduced is 44 per cent, signalling ‘festive bargains galore’, PwC said. Sunday trading laws mean that all the big stores will be limited to opening for just six hours tomorrow. But many will push the rules to breaking point and beyond by  opening early for so-called ‘browsing time’. Adrian Parkinson, spokesman for the Exchange shopping centre in Nottingham, said the weeks leading up to Christmas had been 'mixed', but that there had been a noticeable spike in footfall in the area of late. 'Last weekend was one of the busiest they have seen as a city for some time,' he said. Crush: The last-minute rush, coupled with heavy downpours predicted over the weekend, is expected to result in traffic gridlock in town centres and long queues at tills . In addition, many supermarkets and some Marks & Spencer outlets will open from midnight on the morning of Christmas Eve. Though many people have switched to buying gifts online, the focus will now switch to bricks and mortar outlets. BRC spokesman Richard Dodd said: ‘We do think that this will be the biggest shopping day of the year. In cash terms, we think Saturday will be the biggest shopping day we have ever had, while spending over the weekend is expected to be £4billion to £5billion.’ Many retailers make more than 40 per cent of sales and profits in the run-up to Christmas which makes it a make-or-break period. Mr Dodd said: ‘Retailers are really banking on this weekend to make up the sales they have not made so far. The slow build-up we have seen is really about people being short of money, reluctant to commit to spending and waiting for bargains.’ The BRC spending predictions are in line with a separate estimate from Visa, which is expecting purchases of £1.26billion with its debit and credit cards today. It accounts for around one third of transactions, which would put the total for the day at £3.78billion. Dr Steve Perry, of Visa Europe, said: ‘We anticipate that Saturday will be the busiest shopping day of the year.’ Tablet computers, such as the mini iPad, the Google Nexus and Amazon’s Kindle range have topped many Christmas wish lists alongside smartphones. In terms of toys, the revival of The Furby has proved a success with many stores sold out, while Lego Star Wars has been very popular with boys.","Retailers are predicting a last-minute spending spree of £3.8billion tomorrow on the British high street .

A high-flying City banker who claimed that he was sacked for being ‘too successful’ today won a Supreme Court fight with his former employers. Judges ruled that Raphael Geys, former managing director of European fixed income sales for French bank Societe Generale, could now claim damages for wrongful dismissal. Mr Geys - who was employed by the bank’s London branch and claimed that he had been dismissed without cause - had already argued his case in the High Court and Court of Appeal. The bank disputed his claims but a panel of five Supreme Court justices ruled in his favour by a 4-1 majority after a hearing in London. Mr Geys will now claim around £10.1million in unpaid severance pay from Societe Generale. He can also pursue the bank for damages worth 'several million euros' more for failing to ensure his bonuses were paid in a tax efficient manner. One judge, Lady Hale, said ‘clear and unambiguous notification’ had not been given. ‘The bank could easily have done things properly,’ she added. ‘But for whatever reason they did not do so.’ Raphael Geys, an executive with Societe Generale, told the High Court in 2010 that during . three highly lucrative years at the bank he doubled the income of his . division from £184m to £394m. But he was shocked when, he was summarily dismissed in November 2007. He said he was ‘dismissed for being too successful’ because the bank considered provisions in his contract to be ‘too generous’. The bank, France's second largest, offered him a £7m pay-off but . Mr Geys, former managing director of European fixed income sales, sued. Mr Geys’ lawyers said after today’s ruling by the Supreme Court, the highest court in the UK, that he had been vindicated. ‘This successful outcome for Mr Geys vindicates his decision to take his case to the UK’s highest court,’ said Tom Custance, partner at law firm Fox Williams. Vindicated: Mr Geys was employed by the Societe Generale's London branch (pictured) and claimed he was dismissed for being too successful . ‘The judgment has established several key points of employment law which protect the rights of the innocent party. It should be widely welcomed.’ Mr Custance said the ‘overall effect’ of the Supreme Court’s ruling was that Mr Geys would be entitled to a termination payment worth millions of pounds. Mr Geys, whose 20-year career in investment banking includes stints at the London branches of UBS and Merrill Lynch , was headhunted by Societe Generale in 2005 although he warned the bank at the time it should consider employing a less senior and less expensive banker. His bespoke remuneration package, which included an offshore ""tax efficient"" pay structure he says Societe Generale never implemented, was designed to persuade him to shelve plans to set up an entrepreneurial business with former Merrill Lynch colleagues. He says the package was attractive because it was based on an entrepreneurial approach, with a formulaic bonus that could be wiped out if he failed to perform, a tax efficient wrapper and a generous termination deal if things did not work out. Societe Generale, he said, never expected him to meet the higher performance criteria.","Raphael Geys already argued his case in the High Court and Court of Appeal .

Miss Holmes, 25, was left speechless by the proposal which took place in the middle of the Nativity Live! event, outside Holy Trinity Church, in Hull. Mr Yardley said: 'I only told a few people and we wanted to make sure it happened and I'm glad she said ""yes"". 'It was the perfect setting to propose.' Nativity Live! recreated the Christmas story with actors, real animals and even newborn baby boy Sidney. After a procession down through the city - where there was no room at either the Bonny Boat or the Kingston Inn for the Holy couple - the baby was eventually born in a stable outside Holy Trinity Church. A choir of angels sang carols with the gathered crowds before the glittering star of Bethlehem was hoisted on a cherry picker above the stable, where 10-week old baby Sidney Yardley took on the starring role of Jesus. Setting: Mr Yardley only told a few people of his plan before he made the proposal .

Britain has leapfrogged Brazil in the global economic league tables, regaining the sixth place lost to the South American country this time last year. The UK is also breathing down France’s neck, with our economy likely to overtake that of our nearest neighbours some time in 2013. But Britain will be overhauled in the next decade by both India and Russia, while Brazil will regain the place it lost this year by 2014. Moving up: Britain (London, left) has leapfrogged Brazil (Rio de Janeiro, right) in global economic league tables . The league table is issued by authoritative City forecaster the Centre for Economics and Business Research. It also looks ahead to 2022, when emerging economies are expected to take their place at the top table. While the US will cling on to its place at the top of the league in 2022, according to the Cebr, China is closing the gap fast. As it stands, the Chinese economy is 53 per cent the size of its US rival, but it will have risen to 83 per cent by 2022. Japan will remain in third, but fourth-placed Germany is likely to be overtaken by the meteoric Indian economy, which will also leave the UK trailing in its wake within five years. Cebr chief executive Douglas McWilliams said: ‘the Indians have lost to us at cricket this winter but they are on track to beat us at economics. By 2017 we predict that the Indian economy will be the largest in the Commonwealth.’ Britons can take heart from the fact that the country is expected to retain its top ten place, despite the rapid growth seen in the developing world, and to overtake the French. The Cebr said France was being held back by the economic policies of President Francois Hollande, who has slapped the rich with sky-high taxes. ‘We are poised to overtake France either in 2013 or 2014 as the economic effects of President Hollande’s 75 per cent tax policy and the difficulties of the euro drag France down,’ said Mr McWilliams. Leaders: Just a year ago, French foreign minister Francois Baroin (pictured left with Chancellor George Osborne, right) said: 'From an economic standpoint, we prefer being French than British' Just a year ago, French foreign minister Francois Baroin said that the outlook for France was better than that in the UK, adding: ‘From an economic standpoint, we prefer being French than British.’ The Cebr’s predictions suggest quite the reverse, although many senior economists still believe that the UK will follow France by losing its prized AAA credit rating in 2013. The Government’s anticipated failure to get Britain’s debt-to-output ratio falling by 2015 has already seen ratings agencies put the economy on ‘negative watch’, meaning it risks being downgraded. Italy’s prospects are particularly poor, with the former European powerhouse expected to slide from eight in the world to thirteenth. The decline and fall of Rome will leave it languishing behind countries such as Turkey and Mexico. India’s surge from tenth to fourth will be seen as the biggest change in the balance of the global economy, but Indonesia is primed for its own meteoric rise. The world’s fourth most populous country, with some 238million citizens, will leap from 16th to tenth.","Britain moves into sixth place and is likely to overtake France next year .

The menu included traditional turkey with all the trimmings, as well as sea bass and a trio of desserts. One guest said: 'It was a superb night and Ann looked stunning. She certainly defied her 70 years. 'She was surrounded by family and friends and she had flown in around 20 staff who work with her African charities.' Mrs Gloag runs a school in  Nairobi, Kenya, named in honour of her late son, Jonathan who took his own life in 1999, aged 28. Pop performers: Entertainment at Mrs Gloag's party came from Lulu, left, and Neil Sedaka, right . She now devotes a significant amount of her time to her charitable causes, including support for Mercy Ships, which operates the largest non-governmental hospital ship in the world. Mrs Gloag was awarded an OBE in the 2004 New Year Honours list for her services to charity. In 2005, Edinburgh Napier University awarded her an honorary doctorate. Before being overtaken by Harry Potter author JK Rowling, she was the richest woman in Scotland. Mrs Gloag, a trained nurse, once told how she amassed her wealth by 'fighting for survival'. She became a unit sister in Bridge of Earn Hospital, Perthshire, where she met her future husband, Robin Gloag, while he was a patient. By the 1970s, the couple were running a small caravan sales business. But, after 20 years in nursing, Mrs Gloag branched out. The bus men: Stagecoach Group is an inter-national company operating buses, trains, trams and ferries - and Mrs Gloag serves as a non-executive director . The couple, along with Mrs  Gloag's brother Brian Soutar, who now runs Stagecoach, bought a bus for £425. Their intention was to take the trip of a lifetime to China but the plan failed through visa problems. Instead, the entrepreneurs were invited by a construction company to provide transport for  workers travelling to building sites. The brother and sister realised the potential and with their  savings and their father's timely redundancy payment of £25,000, they bought two more buses. Stagecoach expanded from its limited Perthshire routes to offering cheap tickets between Dundee and London. The venture took off and Stagecoach Group is now an inter-national company operating buses, trains, trams and ferries. Mrs Gloag serves as a non- executive director. Her former husband was killed in a car crash on December 6, 2007. Last year, Mrs Gloag received the prestigious Eleanor Roosevelt Award in recognition of her charitable work over more than three decades. The medal honours individuals who carry out the values which former US First Lady Eleanor  Roosevelt espoused in her public life. Mrs Gloag is a committed Christian and rescued a Kenyan baby, Paul, more than two decades ago and raised him as her own. She once said: 'I've got the view that, regardless of what you do in life, very few of us are remembered. 'I'd like to be remembered as someone who was caring – that, and a great big statue.'","Ann Gloag's black tie party held in Kinfauns Castle, Perthshire, Scotland .

"Bangor Cathedral in North Wales has formed an all-girl choir for the first time in its 1,437 year history . By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 08:00 EST, 17 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:04 EST, 18 December 2012 . A cathedral has formed an all-female choir for the first time in its 1,437 year history. The 14 girls - aged from seven to 17 - are the first female singers to lead services at Bangor Cathedral in North Wales since it was established in the 6th Century. Many cathedrals have traditionally always had all-male choirs but  Archdeacon of Bangor, Paul Davies, said the institutions are now waking up to the fact 'girls can sing as well as boys'. Girl power: Bangor Cathedral in North Wales has an all-female choir for the first time in its 1,437 year history . Time for equality: The 14 girls - aged from seven to 17 - are the first female singers to lead services at the cathedral since it was established in the 6th century . He said: 'There was a perception that . the purest form of treble voice is that of a young boy. But slowly all . cathedrals are realising that, actually, girls can sing as well as . boys.' Bangor Cathedral has broken its own . ancient tradition going back to 575 AD of only allowing boys and men to . sing this Christmas with their all-girl group. The dean of Bangor, the Very Rev Dr Sue Jones, said the all-girls choir was her idea and she's delighted it has now come into fruition. She said: 'I saw it as my mission to try and encourage and bring girls into the worshiping life of the cathedral. 'There is a problem getting boys to join the cathedral choir. I think it's not cool in society for boys to be part of a choral tradition. 'After 1,437 years, this marks the beginning of a new part of our choral tradition here. It is a natural development that will help to ensure that both boys and girls will be in the choirs, which sing praises for many years to come.' Choirs of men and boys have been . singing in the cathedrals and chapels of Britain, almost without . interruption, for more than a thousand years. New chapter: As choir numbers were dwlndling because it wasn't seen as 'cool' for boys, allowing girls to take part could help prevent the tradition dying out . In Britain more than 70 still sing regularly for worship - and that number could rise with the introduction of female choirs. But director of the new all-girls choir Paul Booth said it would take a few years before the group rivalled the men's choir. He said: 'This choir is in its infancy. It will take us a year or two to establish a repertoire and to make sure we know what we are doing. 'But I think they will be absolutely brilliant and on an equal footing with any choir in the land.' Fiona Coutts, 15, said the first all-girls choir was a big step in securing the cathedral's choral tradition. She . said: 'There has been quite a bit of pressure but things are moving . with the times now. I think if we don't have a girls choir the choral . tradition might die out.' The all-girls choir will sing at evensong in Bangor Cathedral every Monday during term time. Girls allowed: The choir will sing at evensong in Bangor Cathedral every Monday during term time . Breaking with tradition: Bangor Cathedral was established in the 6th century and has now opened its choir doors to women .","Bangor Cathedral in North Wales has formed an all-girl choir for the first time in its 1,437 year history ."

A man has been arrested after it is believed he tried to kill his girlfriend while on the run from police. Michael Bennison, 28, was arrested in York yesterday evening following a nationwide manhunt. Bennison, who was homeless, had spent two weeks on the run over a separate alleged assault and drug dealing. However on Friday he is believed to have attacked his 27-year-old girlfriend, allegedly stabbing her and puncturing one of her lungs in a cul-de-sac in Huntington, York. She was taken to York District Hospital to be treated for her injuries and doctors say she is in a stable condition after being treated for multiple wounds. Following the alleged stabbing, a nationwide police manhunt was launched for Bennison after it was feared he had left the city. However, he remained in York and was arrested at a house near to where the woman was attacked on suspicion of attempted murder, possession of drugs with intent to supply and assault. Detective Inspector Shaun Page, of North Yorkshire Police, said: 'I would like to convey my thanks to the media and the many members of the public who have contributed to the search and helped us to locate Bennison.'

Attending the opening of the Football Association's new £100m facility yesterday, the Duchess of Cambridge made sure to dress to impress. With the horror of those topless photos still no doubt looming large in her mind, Kate must have been keen to put on a brave face - and show as little flesh as possible. And so it was: That high-necked wool coat, buttoned up all day without so much as a hemline or collar of a dress beneath revealed. Those black opaque tights and knee-high boots - it was a wonder she didn't wear gloves and a crucifix. Scroll down for video . Smart: Kate wore the grey Angel coat in military grey by Reiss, which retailed at £325 last season when it was in store . In that neat wool coat, from high . street store Reiss, Kate didn't put a fashionable foot wrong - and . reminded observers that she does official engagement style so well.

Her hair was blowdried into the bouncy waves she has made her signature look since she was propelled into the public eye. Accessories were kept simple: her sapphire engagement ring, and at her ears,  discreet drop earrings. Kate's coat - the £325 Angel from a . previous season, was styled with the £65 mock croc Betony belt, also . from Reiss - giving the duchess a smart, cinched-in silhouette - and . putting paid to the pregnancy rumours that constantly crop up. Nipped in: Kate wore the coat with the £65 Betony belt by Reiss (from the 2009 collection), giving her a neat silhouette .

A gunman who killed seven people during a rampage through his Ohio neighbourhood has been described as 'quiet and strange'. Michael Hance, 51, died in a shootout with police in Copley, Ohio, after the killing spree on Sunday, where he shot seven people dead, including his girlfriend's 11-year-old nephew. Robin Hancock, a carer for a couple slain in the rampage, went to the police station in Copley on Monday to hear updates on the killings and the identification of Hance as the gunman. Ms Hancock, 53, of Akron, told CBS news: 'He was quiet and strange.' Killing spree: 'Unpleasant and strange' Michael Hance opened fire on neighbours and his girlfriend's family . Gunned down: Police believe the rampage started after Michael Hance rowed with the family of his girlfriend Becky Dieter, pictured, who was injured in the shooting spree, about the house . The gunman was also described as 'unpleasant' and 'disliked'. Hance had become increasingly belligerent over residents' comments about the state of the property he lived in with his girlfriend of two decades, Becky Dieter. His neighbour Carol Eshleman said Hance had been asked to clean up his property by another resident, Gudrun 'Gerdie' Johnson, around a month ago, but he had thrown her off his property. He began gunning people down after Miss Dieter's family had visited the couple to try and settle a dispute over the property. Members of the Copley, Ohio community hold a candlelight vigil after the devastating shooting spree that left their friends dead . Rampage: Members of the Summit County Sheriff Department leave the scene of the shooting after the gunman was killed . The bitter row is thought to have begun after the deaths of Ms Dieter's parents two years ago, neighbours claimed. Miss Dieter's brother Craig wanted to sell the house, but instead Hance and Miss Dieter moved in. Craig Dieter and his wife Beth had driven to Copley from their home in Walton, Kentucky, to go over the estate. They were visiting the Johnsons when Hance opened fire. Mrs Johnson, 64, was killed in the attack, along with her husband Russell, 67. Their 44-year-old son Bryan Johnson and his daughter Autumn, 16, were also shot dead. Miss Dieter's brother Craig, and his 11-year-old son, Scott, and an unidentified girl who was shot in a parked car with Autumn were the other victims. Scott Dieter was shot in the basement of a third house where he had apparently sought refuge after fleeing through a swamp to get away from the gunman. Miss Dieter, Hance's long-time girlfriend, was also shot but survived and remains in hospital.","Hance described as 'unpleasant' and 'disliked'

"By . Emily Allen . UPDATED: . 13:02 EST, 6 September 2011 . The deaths of Colin McRae and three others in a helicopter crash were caused by the former world rallying champion's 'imprudent' flying, a sheriff has ruled. McRae, 39, his five-year-old son Johnny, the boy's friend Ben Porcelli, six, and Graeme Duncan, 37, all died when the aircraft came down near McRae's home in Lanark on September 15, 2007. Sheriff Nikola Stewart concluded that the deaths could have been avoided if McRae had not engaged in low-level flying 'when it was unnecessary and unsafe to do so'. The deaths of former world rallying champion Colin McRae and three others in a helicopter crash could have been avoided, a sheriff has ruled. However, McRae's father Jimmy said the family believe they will never know what caused the crash and said they were never in any doubt of Colin's 'prowess as a fine pilot'. In her written determination issued today at the end of the 12-day inquiry, the sheriff concluded: 'The deaths and the accident resulting in the deaths might have been avoided had Mr McRae not flown his helicopter into the Mouse Valley. 'Such a precaution would have been entirely reasonable. There was no necessity to enter the Mouse Valley. There were no operational or logistical reasons to enter the Mouse Valley. 'Mr McRae chose to fly the helicopter into the valley. For a private pilot such as Mr McRae, lacking the necessary training, experience or requirement to do so, embarking upon such demanding, low-level flying in such difficult terrain, was imprudent, unreasonable and contrary to the principles of good airmanship.' The scene after the helicopter crash which killed McRae, 39, his five-year-old son Johnny, the boy's six-year-old friend Ben Porcelli and Graeme Duncan, 37 . As part of the hearing, the sheriff and lawyers involved in the case visited the woods near McRae's Jerviswood House home where the Eurocopter Squirrel aircraft crashed, as he flew home from a trip to see a friend. One of the crash victims, Mr Duncan, filmed much of the outbound and return flights on his personal camcorder and some of the footage was recovered and included in the inquiry hearings. Sheriff Stewart said the footage indicated that the helicopter was being flown 'imprudently' and 'without due regard to the principles of good airmanship'. She wrote: 'The video recording provides detailed information as to the manner in which Mr McRae piloted G-CBHL that day. Police forensics near the house on Colin McRae's estate in Lanark following a fatal helicopter crash . 'He consistently flew the helicopter at unnecessarily low heights. He clearly breached the 500-feet minimum separation requirement on at least one occasion when he detoured to fly at 275 feet over farm buildings, and may well have done so on others. 'He undertook significant manoeuvring at low level and the helicopter seems to have encountered significant g-loading as a result, to the evident enjoyment of his passengers. 'The episodes of extremely low-level . flying and the excessive manoeuvre parameters, particularly the descent . into the valley by Larkhall, all as captured on the video recording, are . indicative of an aircraft being flown imprudently, without due regard . to the principles of good airmanship and in such a way that normal . safety margins would be reduced.' Colin MCRae's son Johnny McRae, five, and his friend Ben Porcelli, six, died . Colin McRae and his friend Graeme Duncan, 37, both died in the crash just yards from McRae's home . The report stated that the video . recording ended about 55 seconds flying time from the accident site and . prior to the entry to Mouse Valley. Sheriff Stewart added: 'At that time, . Mr McRae appears to be relaxed and in control of the aircraft, which . seems to be operating satisfactorily. 'The manner in which he handles the aircraft suggests he continues to have no concerns about its serviceability.' To fly an aircraft in the UK, it is . necessary to hold a pilot's licence and a valid medical certificate, and . to have the licence validated with the type of aircraft to be flown. Jimmy McRae, Mr McRae's father, said he hoped the family would be able to 'move forward' following the findings. Sheriff Stewart found McRae did not hold a valid flying licence or a valid 'rating' for the Eurocopter Squirrel helicopter. 'He was, accordingly, in breach of . article 26 of the Air Navigation Order 2005 when he flew his helicopter . on September 15 2007 and should not have flown that machine at that . time,' she said. Jimmy McRae, the rally driver's father, said he hoped the family would be able to 'move forward' following the findings. He said: 'The past four years have been extremely difficult for all the families concerned and we hope that now we can move forward. 'We still believe we will never know what caused the crash but we were never in any doubt as to Colin's prowess as a fine pilot. 'Everybody knows from Colin's rallying career that safety is always an issue and that his reactions and eye and hand co-ordination were world-class.' He said his family had wanted a finding that private aircraft should be fitted with a flight data recorder. He said: 'Had a flight recorder been fitted to the aircraft, it may have been possible to determine what occurred in the final seconds of the flight and what actually caused the helicopter to crash. 'This would prevent uncertainty as to the cause of the crash and allow lessons to be learned from tragic accidents such as this.' The McRae family's solicitor, Peter Watson, said: 'Although Colin's licence was out-of-date, this played no contributory factor whatsoever to the accident.'","Inquiry finds the crash could have been avoided .

"Emory University department uncovering history behind centuries-old names . Historians encouraging input from people who may share a name, or have such names as part of their family lore . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 03:35 EST, 30 December 2011 . Most of the millions of Africans enslaved before 1807 were known only . by numbers, the stories of their ancestry either a part of family lore or completely re-written upon their disembarkment in America. The move came after Obama's presidential campaign when he hired genealogists to research his  family's roots - however aides kept the findings secret. So far, two men named Obama sit among . some 9,500 captured Africans whose names were written on line after . line in the registries of obscure, 19th century slave trafficking . courts - registries recorded almost two centuries before there was a man with the same name in the White House. There is no proof that the unidentified Obama has ties to President Barack Obama. All they share is a name. But that is exactly the commonality that . Emory University researchers hope to build upon as they delve into the . origins of Africans who were taken up and sold. Study: Liz Milewicz, former project manager for African-Origins, discusses how rich information can be deciphered from African names, such as place and time of birth . Researchers at the Atlanta school have built an online database . around those names, and welcome input from people who may share a name . that's in the database, or have such names as part of their family lore. David Eltis, an . Emory University history professor who heads the database research team, explained: 'The whole point of the project is to . ask the African diaspora, people with any African background, to help . us identify the names because the names are so ethno-linguistically . specific, we can actually locate the region in Africa to which the . individual belonged on the basis of the name.' The courts processed the human chattel freed from ships that . were intercepted and detoured to Havana, Cuba or Freetown, Sierra Leone. Most of the millions of Africans enslaved before 1807 were known only . by numbers, said James Walvin, an expert on the trans-Atlantic slave . trade. Once bought by slave owners, the Africans' names were lost. Africans captured by the Portuguese were baptised and given 'Christian' names aboard the ships that were taking them into slavery. Analysis: Nafees Khan, project manager for African-Origins, listens to the recordings of names to identify their ethno-linguistic origins at Emory University in Atlanta . But original African names — surnames . were uncommon for Africans in the 19th century — are rich with . information. Some reveal the day of the week an individual was born or . whether that individual was the oldest, youngest or middle child or a . twin. They can also reveal ethnic or linguistic groups. The . president's father was from Kenya, on the eastern coast of Africa, and . Eltis said it was rare for captives to hail from areas far from the port . where their ships set sail. The unidentified Obamas on the slave ships . sailed from west Africa. Walvin, author of 'The Zong,' a book about the . slave trade, said there were Africans who had been brought great . distances before they were forced onto ships. 'Often their enslavement had begun much . earlier, deep in the African interior, most of them captured through . acts of violence, warfare or kidnap, or for criminal activity...' Walvin . said in his book, which chronicles the true story of a captain who . ordered a third of the slaves aboard his ship thrown overboard due to a . shortage of drinking water. Intercepted: An image describes the H.M.S. 'Pluto' capturing the slaver 'Orion' on November 30, 1859 as it sails off the African coast . Horrific conditions: During the 1840's, in Sierra Leone, canoes carried up to 200 slaves in their bottom, with dimensions only about 40 feet long, 12 broad, and seven or eight feet deep . Disturbing: Illustrations published in 1857 depict the capture of slaver schooner 'Zeldina' and the conditions of the slaves disembarked . Obama's ancestors, a nomadic people known as the River Lake Nilotes, migrated from Bahr-el-Ghazal Province in Sudan toward Uganda and into Western Kenya, according to Sally Jacobs, author of 'The Other Barack', a book about the president's father. They were part of several clans and subclans that eventually became the Luo people of Kenya, Jacobs writes. The president's great-grandfather's name was Obama. Obama is derived from the word 'bam', meaning crooked or indirect, she said in her book. But it's also possible that Obama was a name used by other cultural groups in Africa and for whom the name had a different meaning. Migration: A map shows the primary trans-Atlantic routes out of Africa during the slave trade between 1500-1900 . Captive: An illustration shows slave traders preparing to unload human cargo at a seemingly wealthy port . Awaiting passage: An illustration of a trade port, holding a fort typically built by European powers as a depot for the exchange of gold, ivory, and captured Africans . The slaves found aboard intercepted ships provided their names, age and sometimes where they were from, through translators, to English and Spanish speaking court registrars who wrote their names as they sounded to them. Body scars or identifying marks also were recorded. The details were logged in an attempt to prevent the Africans from being enslaved again, which didn't always work. Emory's researchers are including audio clips of the names as they would likely be pronounced in Africa. 'These . people enslaved were not just a nebulous group of people with no place . and no name,' said Kwesi DeGraft-Hanson, one of the researchers, who has . found variations of his name, his brother's and his children's names in . the database. He is originally from Ghana. 'That's how lot of us view . slavery. We don't have names faces to go with it... It makes them that . much more removed from us.' Postbellum period: Photos taken in rural Alabama in the 1890s - thirty years after slavery's end .

Eltis . and his researchers acknowledge the database may not help African . Americans with genealogical research because records on the Africans . once they were freed from the ships are harder to find, if they exist at . all. However, the project provides another piece in a major jigsaw, and helps put together a bigger picture on slavery, Walvin said. Before this project, Eltis and others assembled a database of 35,000 trans-Atlantic slave ship voyages responsible for the flow of more than 10million Africans to the Americas. Together, the two databases provide some details on the horrific voyages of the Africans, including the Obamas. Political leader: President Barack Obama steps to the podium to speak in the White House's Brady Briefing Room after signing the payroll tax cut extension on Friday, December 23 . The Xerxes, which carried one of the unidentified Obamas, was a 138-foot schooner that began its voyage in Havana with a crew of 44. Five guns were mounted aboard when the ship left on a slave purchasing trip to Bonny on February 10, 1828. Sailing under the Spanish flag, the ship's captain Felipe Rebel purchased 429 slaves, nearly one third of them children, before setting out on a return trip to the Americas. But on June 26, 1828, the Xerxes was intercepted and forced to dock at an unknown Cuban port. By then, 26 slaves had died. The other unidentified Obama, 6-foot-3-inches tall, was one of 562 Africans shackled in the belly of the Midas. The vessel was a Brig, a fast, manoeuvrable ship with two square-rigged masts. It was equipped with eight guns. Midas' captain J Martinez and a crew of 53 left Cuba on an unknown date. It left Bonny with 562 slaves but was intercepted. It docked in Cuba July 8, 1829 minus 162 slaves who had died during the voyage. Some slaves freed from seized ships were returned to Africa, but not always to their original homelands. Some were sent to Liberia or were allowed to remain free in the cities where the courts were located. Some may have been re-enslaved and some died on ships that were returning them to Africa.","Emory University department uncovering history behind centuries-old names .

"By . Matt Chorley and Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 08:58 EST, 18 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:39 EST, 19 November 2012 . Tory MP David Davis today called for two votes two national votes - one to approve a list of powers for the UK to seek to seize back and then an in-out poll once they had been negotiated . David Cameron has made a series of phone calls to other EU leaders ahead of crunch talks this week aimed at preventing Brussels budget growing even larger. The Prime Minister is under increasing pressure to secure a freeze in spending from Tory rebels, the Labour party and the voting public. But he faces an uphill struggle after it emerged EU officials have begun plotting to secure a budget deal without Britain. The Prime Minister today insisted Brussels had to stop 'picking the pockets' of the public amid reports that EU officials and diplomats are in talks on the legal and financial viability of agreeing a new seven-year budget amongst the 26 member states excluding the UK. Downing Street said the Prime Minister 'has been hitting the phones this weekend, speaking to several European partners as we continue to work constructively to find a deal on the EU's multi-annual budgetary cycle'. His spokesman said Mr Cameron had spoken to his counterparts in France, Germany, Holland, Sweden, Denmark and Poland. Speaking at the CBI conference in London today, Mr Cameron said challenging the EU's spending made him a 'good European'. 'I make absolutely no apologies for standing up strongly for Britain in Europe on some of our priorities,' the PM said. He said in the UK pay and benefits had been frozen and budgets cut, and Europe had to do the same. 'I . don't think it makes you a bad European because you want a tough budget . settlement in Europe. I think it makes you a good European. I think I . have got the people of Europe on my side in arguing that we should stop . picking their pockets and spending more and more money through the EU . budget, particularly when so many parts of the European budget are not . well spent.' The Prime Minister has pledged to . renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels and then put that deal . to the public. He is expected to use a speech before Christmas to say . that would involve a referendum after the next election. David Cameron told business leaders at the annual Confederation of British Industry conference that tackling Brussels spending made him a 'good European' But Mr Davis warned that voters would . not believe him because he reneged on a ‘cast iron’ pledge to hold a . referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. ‘Nobody believes it and why should . they?’ he told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show. ‘The British public have . been promised a referendum by the three major parties, and every single . one has not delivered. The public feel they’ve been lied to – they won’t . believe any more promises on referendums.’ If a referendum were held on the UK's membership of the European Union, how do you think you would vote? 56% - Vote to leave . 30% - Vote to remain . 14% - Don't know . Source: Opinium/The Observer . Mr Davis demanded two referendums: One . to win public backing for a shopping list of areas where Britain wants . to renegotiate, the other to either approve the deal that is thrashed . out or to leave the EU. And he insisted Mr Cameron pass legislation before the next election to ‘put this in law’. Mr Davis, said: ‘There’s going to be a referendum, . whoever’s in power in the next five years, because the British public . will demand it – they won’t put up with it anymore.’ He added today that he was prepared to bet ‘a large sum of money’ on the UK being out of the EU within a decade if the government was unable to secure major changes on the relationship with Brussels. In a speech at London's St Stephen's Club, the former home secretary called for all justice and home powers to be repatriated permanently along with control over immigration and employment legislation. The Prime Minister is under fire on several fronts over Europe last night, facing waves of criticism from Tory . rebels, Ed Miliband and voters over his approach to Brussels. CBI President Sir Roger Carr added to . the pressure today, with a warning that calls for withdrawal from the . EU risk 'isolation' which put trade deals in danger. Speaking . at the opening of the CBI annual conference, Sir Roger said: 'Whatever . the popular appeal may be of withdrawal, businessmen and politicians . must keep a bridge firmly in place. Call for reform: Ed Miliband said eurosceptics are right on many issues, including the European Union budget, immigration and state aid . Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron should be concentrating on 'building alliances' to secure reforms in the EU . 'As countries of Europe bind together in pursuit of salvation, we in the UK must work harder to avoid the risks of isolation.' As . Mr Cameron prepares to . attend crunch talks on the EU budget this week, it was reported that EU . officials are trying to strike a deal without Britain which could see . the Brussels budget rise. ‘People are looking, both in national . capitals and in Brussels, for a solution at 26,’ an official told the . Financial Times. ‘It is being looked at from a financial and legal point . of view.’ Mr Cameron has said he is willing to veto any budget deal which he thinks is not in Britain's interest. But Ken Clarke, the Europhile minister without portfolio, warned the stance would mean the EU ignored the EU entirely. 'If . you turn up saying ‘we’re not going to agree to anything come what . may’, which the hard-line people would love him to say, all that happens . is they’ll take no notice of us,' he told BBC Radio 4. Without . agreement on a seven-year deal, the EU would proceed on year-by-year . budgets which would cost even more, Mr Clarke added. 'What . we’re proposing is a freeze for seven years. That’s much tougher than . anything we’ve suggested so far for British public spending. And that’s a . good starting point. It gives us a position in negotiations.' Business Secretary Vince Cable backed the PM the Prime Minister to argue the UK's case for a real-terms freeze in the EU budget in a 'forceful way' Mr Cameron is under pressure to hold to a freeze, after 53 Tory rebels backed a Commons motion last month calling for a real-terms cut in EU spending. Mr Davis, a leading right-winger, warned that the public believes Mr Cameron has lied to them . about the prospects of a referendum. He spoke out as a new poll showed that the public overwhelmingly wants him to take a much tougher line with Brussels. And in another assault, Labour leader . Mr Miliband will call for sweeping reforms of the EU budget in an . attempt to win over eurosceptic voters. Mr Cameron is preparing to demand the . EU budget rises by no more than inflation when he attends a summit this . week, defying his MPs who want to see the budget cut in cash terms. But in a blow to Mr Cameron’s credibility, a ComRes poll found that 66 per cent of voters want the budget cut. The PM has said he thinks the UK . should stay part of the European Union. But the poll found that 58 per . cent think Britain should withdraw if powers cannot be restored to . Westminster – a view that is shared by at least ten members of the . Cabinet. Some 43 per cent want to pull out of . the EU regardless and one in four Tory voters is considering voting for . the UK Independence Party which advocates withdrawal. Mr Cameron will . come under further pressure today when Boris Johnson says he must veto . the ‘amazing’ demands of the European Commission for a 5 per cent rise . in spending. To make matters worse for Mr Cameron, . he is now facing a Labour leader keen to convince voters that his party . is no longer an uncritical admirer of Brussels. Ed Miliband used a speech today to . call for reforms to how EU money is spent. He said: ‘For more than . three decades our membership of the European Union has seemed to be a . settled question. Not any more.’ He argued Mr Cameron is the wrong . man to reform Brussels because the growing euroscepticism of the Tory . party has made it impossible for him to build alliances with other EU . countries. ‘Many of our traditional allies in . Europe clearly think that Britain is heading to the exit door,’ he said. ‘I will not allow our country to sleepwalk toward exit because it . would be a betrayal of our national interest. ‘We cannot afford to use up our energies and alliances on negotiations that will not deliver.’ A Tory source said: ‘Ed Miliband and the Labour Party have zero credibility on negotiating in Europe. ‘They gave up half our rebate and got . nothing in return, and approved inflation-busting increases in European . spending at every opportunity.’ Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said Mr Cameron was right to argue the UK's case for a real-terms freeze in the EU budget in a 'forceful way'. He said: 'The budget proposals are unacceptable. I support the hard line, but that does not mean I am anti-Europe - quite the opposite.'","56 per cent would vote for Britain to leave the European Union in a referendum, opinion poll finds .

"By . Hugo Duncan . UPDATED: . 16:04 EST, 17 February 2012 . The price of diesel raced to a record high last night in a devastating blow to millions of motorists. The average forecourt price hit 143.05p a litre – meaning it now costs more than £100 to fill up the 70-litre tank in a typical family car. It means the price of filling up has increased by £20.50 in just two years – a punishing 26 per cent. The price of diesel at the pumps now averages 142.9p a litre - just shy of the record of 143.04p set last May . Petrol prices are also on the rise. They hit 135.39p a litre yesterday, just shy of the 137.43p record reached in May last year. The Retail Motor Industry, a lobby . group for petrol station owners, said the latest price surge was a . ‘disaster for motorists’ ahead of a planned 3p-a-litre increase in fuel . duty in August. It is feared that the rise will push . up the price of other everyday essentials such as food as everyone from . farmers to supermarkets look to recoup the higher costs of transporting . goods. ‘The impact of record diesel prices . will be felt by everyone as higher transport costs are passed on to . business and consumers,’ said AA president Edmund King. ‘A stronger pound has staved off this . moment for longer than might have been expected. Diesel drivers across . the country have been watching in trepidation. ‘They hoped that below-record prices would hold until the spring, when winter price pressures on diesel traditionally ease. ‘With some delivery and haulage firms . adding a diesel surcharge to invoices, costs will rise faster than most . people expect and stoke inflation again. ‘Like petrol, there is no price transparency in the wholesale and retail diesel market.’ Soaring: Diesel has now reached £1.43 per litre - and prices could go even higher before Easter . He added: ‘Although the diesel price . has been influenced by refinery closures, unreliable supply into Europe . and stock market speculators taking advantage of a tight market, there . is no way for businesses and consumers to find out whether or not they . are paying a fair price.’ The recent rise in oil price has come . as a surprise. It was thought the price would remain stable at a lower . level but tensions in the Middle East and Iran have driven it up amid . fears about supply from the oil-rich region. The AA has written to Chancellor . George Osborne calling for an investigation of the oil, refining, fuel . product and retail markets ‘to ensure UK families and business are . protected from over-inflated prices and supply difficulties’. It has also called for an end to . annual fuel duty hikes while the economy falters. This includes . cancelling the planned rise in August. Northern Ireland has the highest average petrol prices - 135.9p a litre - while northern England has the cheapest, at 134.2p (file picture) Two years ago, diesel in the UK averaged 113.62p a litre. Then, it cost £79.50 to fill the 70-litre fuel tank on a Ford Mondeo. RMI petrol chairman Brian Madderson . claimed a ‘perfect storm’ of rising oil prices and worries about supply . could push diesel and petrol prices even higher by Easter. He said it would put the livelihoods of hundreds of petrol station owners and staff at risk. The previous high for diesel was 143.04p a litre in May last year, at the height of the ‘Arab Spring’. The uprisings in the Middle East and . North Africa pushed up oil prices, and in turn prices at the pumps, amid . fears over a shortage of supply. RAC spokesman John Franklin said: . ‘The new record price of diesel shows the issue of rising fuel prices . isn’t going away. Drivers continue to be hit hard in their pockets . during these tough economic times. ‘With a further 3p-a-litre fuel duty rise planned in August, we hope the Chancellor will take a look at this in the Budget.’","Price for diesel at pumps now averages 143.05p a litre - nearly 30p more than two years ago .

A Jeremy Kyle programme was pulled after complaints that the host mocked a guest who suffers from dyslexia. Minister for disabled people Esther McVey blasted ITV bosses after Kyle chastised a guest called Glyn for being unable to remember his children's birthdays. He appeared to mock the man for his lack of memory, and dismissed his defence that he had dyslexia. Controversy: An MP has complained to ITV bosses over a broadcast of the Jeremy Kyle show where the host dismissed and appeared to mock a man suffering from dyslexia . Mrs McVey, MP for Wirral West, wrote to ITV's head of television Peter Fincham telling him broadcasters should think 'long and hard' about their content. As a result the episode was pulled from the channel's repeat schedule. Grandfather David Edwards, 60, from Hoylake, on the Wirral, Merseyside, was shocked after watching the daytime TV presenter and contacted Mrs McVey. He asked for her help in seeking a full apology from Kyle for what Mr Edwards branded as 'vile' treatment of a dyslexic guest. He said the host should have been better informed about the full details of the condition and that the channel should never have allowed the programme to go on air. Shocked: Grandfather David Edwards, 60, says Kyle's comments about dyslexia were 'shocking' and ill-informed . The grandfather-of-three contacted the show's producers, who wrote back saying the incident was due to Kyle not being 'fully informed on the subject matter' and that the complaint was being taken 'very seriously'. Mr Edwards said: 'I am not a fan of Jeremy Kyle at all and just happened to catch it when I was visiting my daughter but couldn't believe what I was hearing. Fury: MP Esther McVey has demanded an apology from Kyle and fears he set a bad example to viewers regarding vulnerable members of society . 'This man was on the show over the breakdown of his relationship and was being humiliated by Jeremy for not being able to remember his children's birthdates. 'The guest said it was a consequence of being dyslexic but Jeremy decided he was an expert on the condition because a 'very good friend' had it and it was all about reading and writing. 'Glyn was being verbally attacked and mocked all because of Jeremy's ignorance. I found it disgusting that children could be watching this show and taking what he said to be true - it was totally wrong.' In her letter to Mr Fincham, Ms McVey said: 'Whilst I accept that the style of the show is to a degree 'confrontational' I believe ... that efforts need to be made to ensure that Mr Kyle's style is not seen by vulnerable viewers as the norm, leaving them to believe it is okay to launch verbal attacks on others. 'At a time when the media is in the spotlight I believe it is incumbent on all broadcasters to think long and hard about programme content, ensuring at all times that it will be seen as acceptable to the viewing public.' She has now written to culture and media minister Ed Vaizey asking for his comments. Mr Fincham stated that the show had a 'duty of care' to participants and that while Kyle's style of communicating is viewed 'positively' by many, he 'would like to apologise for any offence caused'. But Mr Edwards said the response was 'inadequate' and that Kyle should apologise himself for 'misleading' viewers. He added: 'His utterly misleading comments were broadcast to a large number of viewers and the very least he should do is apologise to those viewers and take the opportunity to point out that some people dyslexia is a debilitating condition. 'I really believe that he needs to undo the harm he created. I am now going to write to the producers again to demand Kyle says sorry on television.'

Olympic organsiers have come under fire over the condition of site used for the temporary equestrian centre, which remains a muddy quagmire and closed to the public six months after the end of the games. Queen's field in Greenwich Park was transformed into a spectacular venue for the equestrian events which saw thousands of spectators cheering Team GB's Olympic and Paralympic teams to victory. But today some 45 acres remain fenced-off to the public and are likely to stay shut until summer, meaning they will be closed for an entire year. Quagmire: Queen's field in Greenwich Park, the site of the temporary . equestrian centre, is still closed to the public six months after the . end of London 2012 . Olympic venue: Fans cheer Britain's Nick Skelton to victory in the showjumping event in August . Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry look on during the show jumping at Greenwich Park on July 31 . Local residents have accused Olympic organising committee Locog of not employing sufficient staff and failing to re-lay the grass before the onset of winter. Circus Field on neighbouring Blackheath, which is a nature-conservation area and home to acid grassland, was transformed into a staging area for the events and also suffered damage. Before the start of the games the Queen's granddaughter and Olympic medallist Zara Phillips said it would be pointless building a temporary venue that would simply have to be taken down again . Sev D'Souza, who led the 'No to Greenwich Olympic Equestrianism campaign', told the Daily Telegraph: 'This is the only green space within walking distance for many thousands of people and the most popular, accessible part of the park will have been out of bounds for more than a year. 'We were promised by Locog that it would be back to normal as soon as was possible, but then they employed hardly any people to work on the site, so the work has not been completed. What we're left with is a mess.' It cost an estimated £120 million to transform Greenwich Park for the games which saw Britain's Nick Skelton triumph in the showjumping and Charlotte Dujardin in the dressage. There was success for Britain in the Paralympics events saw Sophie Christiansen and Natasha Baker both take gold with the British team collect a record 11 medal haul. But the decision to use Greenwich as the site for the temporary centre had come under a great deal of criticsm before the start of the games. In a 2009 interview with the Times, the Queen's grandaughter Zara Phillips, who would later leave Greenwich with a silver medal, said . it would be pointless building a temporary venue that would simply have to be taken . down again. She said: 'Why don't you do it to a space that can used with a legacy, not Greenwich Park where people walk their dogs?' A Locog spokesman blamed bad weather at the end of the Paralympic games but said the park should be restored by Spring. He said: 'Locog handed back the venue last month. We believe the condition of Greenwich Park will continue to improve. It will flourish by next spring, at the end of a full growing season.

Margrave, 40, sparked a huge police search of rivers, reservoirs . fields, ditches, houses and gardens when he went missing after setting . off from his home in Rawcliffe Bridge, East Yorks., to test out his new . Yamaha motorcycle. He had crashed and tumbled into a 6ft-deep ditch during the accident on September 11. His . cries for help went unheard but he couldn’t save himself due to the . extent of his injuries and was forced to wait until he was found.

Mr Margrave was rushed to Doncaster Royal Infirmary where he was sedated and placed on a ventilator in intensive care. He was suffering from hypothermia, a fractured spine, broken ribs and needed surgery to clear his airway. Lucky Anthony, who suffered . hypothermia, dehydration and severe injuries including a fractured . spine, has now spoken out from Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital . about how lucky he is to be alive - and how he hopes to be back home . within six months.

Police officers visiting a school to talk to children about 'respecting your peers' broke up a playground fight between two pupils using pepper spray. The two officers were lecturing youngsters when a scuffle broke out at lunchtime between two 15-year-old boys. One officer then sprayed the painful anti-riot device in the boys' faces - even though no punches were thrown. A fight broke out between two teenage boys at Danetre and Southbrook Learning Village, pictured, and police responded by using pepper spray . Police today defended claims . the tactic was too heavy-handed saying it was the most appropriate . means to break up the fight between the two 15-year-old boys. They said the pepper spray was used . because physically separating the boys could have 'dislocated their . shoulders or broken their arms'. The incident happened at Danetre and Southbrook Learning Village, in Daventry, Northamptonshire on December 3. Sgt Sam Dodds, from Northamptonshire police said: 'The school invited us in for a week to talk to the students about their role in the school among their peers and in the wider community. 'It also gave us a good chance to try and break down some of the barriers. 'While we were in the school on the Monday a scuffle broke out. Police today defended claims the tactic was too heavy-handed saying it was the most appropriate means to break up the fight at the school . Pepper spray is an  aerosol spray containing oils obtained from cayenne pepper. It is irritating to the eyes and respiratory passages and used as a disabling device. It is generally used by spraying it directly into an individual’s eyes, forcing them to close them. The spray gives a burning sensation which will last approximately 30 minutes. The idea behind the use of a pepper spray is that the receiver suffers from reduced vision and is therefore less likely to approach police in a threatening way. It was introduced into the UK in 2001 for use by police forces. But it is illegal for citizens to both bring pepper spray into the UK and to possess it. Individuals who are caught carrying or using pepper spray can be arrested. There are many criticisms of the use of pepper spray ranging from the fact that it does not work on all individuals to the suggestion it could cause more damage to the eyes than first thought. 'The two students involved were being kept apart, but it was clear they were not calming down. 'Teachers only have the same powers as the general public have in these circumstance and there was a worry the children or others might be injured, so we deployed parva [pepper] spray.' A spokesperson for Northamptonshire Police added: 'It was deemed the most appropriate means to split up the two boys. 'Physically pulling away 15-year-old's in they situation could cause injuries to the children - such as dislocated shoulders and broken arms. 'The effects of the spray wear off quickly and there is no lasting damage.' However, parents of children at the academy school, which caters for pupils aged 3-19, yesterday gave a mixed reaction to the police officers' actions. A mother-of-two, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I thought pepper spray was only used in extreme circumstances - not on young teenagers. 'It was a heavy-handed tactic and a bit over the top I believe.' Another parent added: 'It'll teach them a good lesson. They won't do it again in a hurry will they?' Headteacher David Howell said: 'It's not a situation we'd normally call the police in, but given they were here it seemed sensible. 'The good thing was that in the end no one was injured and no punches where thrown.'","Officers were lecturing teenagers in Daventry, Northamptonshire .

HSBC will offer refunds to hundreds of thousands of customers who made ATM withdrawals but forgot to pick up their cash. Those who left money in HSBC cash machines between 2005 and 2011 will receive compensation after the bank pocketed the money instead of refunding it to customers’ accounts straight away. HSBC’s move follows that of state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland,  which also owns NatWest. The company recently promised to return £10million to 300,000 people. Justice: Money saving expert Martin Lewis says it is more common than we think to leave money at the ATM . Notes are sucked back into an ATM if they are not collected within 30 seconds. When this happens, most banks return the credit to customers’ accounts, as it has not physically been removed – but until recently HSBC and RBS took the money themselves, putting the onus on customers to claim it back. This system left most victims under the impression that their cash had been taken by a passer-by. Both banks changed their policy  in early 2011, and now perform  automatic refunds when notes are not collected. Cashback: RBS is paying back millions to customers who forgot to pick up cash at ATM machines . Refunds for the six years before the . switch will now be made to  all affected ATM users, regardless of which . bank they have an  account with. RBS is tracing all withdrawals made at . its ATMs since January 2005, while HSBC is going back to May 2005. The . banks say this is as far back as their records go. Both companies are also  relying on their rivals to trawl through their own data to find affected customers. Martin . Lewis, founder of the Money Saving Expert website, said: ‘It may seem . odd to some that people leave cash in ATMs, yet a mixture of . forgetfulness, hurry, and sleep deprivation mean it’s more common than . you think. ‘It’s good to see these banks putting this right – after all, they’ve been taking the cash out of people’s accounts.’ In . addition to returning money that customers never collected, RBS is also . providing a goodwill payment equal to the interest that would have been . earned in its top savings account at the time of the attempted . withdrawal. Its first batch . of letters detailing the repayments were sent out in August. HSBC says . it has not yet calculated how many customers are affected, or how much . money is due, but it has confirmed that it will, like RBS, provide . ‘additional goodwill payments’. Cash boost: Most banks automatically hand back the cash to customers who forget to collect their money from automated banking machines . An HSBC spokesman said: ‘The bank is now working with its industry body towards proactively refunding customers. ‘There . is no need to take any action – we will contact HSBC customers directly . and will contact non-customers via their own bank, to advise details of . any refund.’ This year . banks have been heavily criticised for not repaying money that customers . are entitled to. There is growing evidence that they flout clear rules . that businesses can only refuse to refund a customer if he or she has . acted ‘fraudulently’ or had been ‘grossly negligent’. In some cases, . including when a current account has been hacked or a wallet is stolen . from a locked car, customers are having the blame pinned on them and are . refused refunds. The . controversy over RBS’s ATM policy comes a month after it confirmed it . had put aside another £400million for refunds for mis-selling payment . protection insurance. The bank has now set aside a total of £1.7billion . for the cases.

The plates are being sold by regtransfers.co.uk, who insist that they are legal despite licensing rules that say inappropriate combinations can be removed. The website's Angela Banh said: 'There is actually nothing rude or inappropriate about it, it’s just the way that it is interpreted by some. 'Obviously, there are connotations associated with the plate, but . arguably, it has become something of a modern day antique and in . addition to providing hours of conversations and joviality, the PEN 15 . plate is also a wise investment.' Although the rude range is being made available to the public, the DVLA often 'suppresses' number plates that may cause offence. Banned: Alan Clarke from Chesterfield, was instructed by the DVLA to remove the plate 'BO11 LUX' from his Range Rover last year, just six weeks after he had bought it for £399 . Plates that have been banned by the organisation include, MU12DER, PE12ADO and PE12VRT. A DVLA panel decides what number and letter combinations may cause offence before plates are issued and offending combinations are then withheld from circulation. Banned plates can include combinations clearly bearing a resemblance to offensive terms, including HE12 OIN, NA12 ZEE and DR12 UGS. But the agency's decision to ban more trivial combinations has left some perplexed. In 2007, number plates in Scotland bearing the sequence SN07 were banned for being offensive, as the sequence could bear a resemblance to the word 'snot'. Alan Clarke, from Chesterfield, was . instructed to remove a plate from his vehicle last year, just six weeks . after he had bought it. Clarke . had spent £399 on the 'BO11 LUX' plate for his new Range Rover, but . soon received a stern letter from the DVLA telling him the plate was . 'causing offence' and ordering him to remove it. Cheeky: Car-owners will have to spend £9,000 for this number plate . Many number plates, including PEN15, were issued by local authorities before the DVLA came into existence. If the agency receives a complaint about such a plate, a review can be launched as to whether it is appropriate. A DVLA Spokesperson said: 'DVLA regularly reviews the appropriateness of registration numbers as society changes.  Our policy in respect of withholding registration numbers is clear. 'They are withheld in instances where if displayed on a number plate they are likely to cause general offence or embarrassment.  The reasons can be on the grounds of political, racial and religious sensitivities or simply that they are regarded as being in poor taste. 'If we are made aware that a previously issued number is deemed offensive,  we would consider withdrawing the number.'","Rude range of plates goes on sale, including BO11LOX and 53XEY .

If you are reading this squeezed uncomfortably into a packed commuter train, take heart – things could be worse. Unless, that is, you are a regular on the 7.44am from Henley-on-Thames to Paddington, which was yesterday named the most overcrowded train in the country. The First Great Western service carries nearly twice its passenger capacity and tops a league table of shame published by Transport Minister Norman Baker to highlight the top ten most overcrowded train services in England and Wales. Graphic shows the worst train services in the UK in terms of how busy they are . Top ten according to data collected in autumn 2011. The load factor figure is based on 100% being the normal capacity of the train . :1. FGW 7.44am Henley-on-Thames to London Paddington 180% overcrowding, 179 excess passengers . 2. SWT 7.32am Woking to London Waterloo 164%, 471 . 3. LM 6.13pm London Euston to Birmingham New Street 162%, 431 . 4. LM 4.48pm Euston to Birmingham New Street 160%, 270 . 5. FGW 6:30am Banbury to Paddington 158%, 131 . 6. LM 7.55am Stourbridge Junction to Stratford-upon-Avon 157%, 203 . 7. FTP 6.23am Manchester Airport to Middlesbrough 155%, 91 . 8. NE 6.17pm London Liverpool Street to Shenfield 154%, 465 . 9. LM 7:14pm Alton to Waterloo 152%, 385 . 10. LM 5.46pm Euston to Birmingham New Street 152%*, 383 . * Rounded-up figure but slightly lower than the ninth-placed Alton service. The operator abbreviations are FGW - First Great Western; SWT - South West Trains; LM - London Midland; FTP - First TransPennine Express; NE - National Express East Anglia. Some are packing in hundreds more passengers than they were designed to carry. The 7.44am from the Oxfordshire town . into the capital has a ‘load factor’ of 180 per cent. This means it was . at 80 per cent over capacity in standard-class carriages when the survey . was carried out during autumn 2011. As a sting in the tail, passengers are paying through the nose for the . privilege. From January 2, Henley season ticket holders will see their . annual fare rise 4.18 per cent to £3,388. However, First Great Western did recently add a carriage to the 7.44am, increasing the number of standard class seats to 340. The second most crowded service was the South West Trains 7.32am service . from Woking in Surrey to Waterloo, which was 64 per cent over capacity. It carried 471 more passengers than it should. Third and fourth were two . London Midland evening services from Euston to Birmingham New Street – . the 6.13pm, which was 62 per cent over capacity, and the 4.48pm at 60 . per cent over capacity. All other services in the top ten were also at least 50 per cent over capacity. Transport Minister Mr Baker urged train operators to continue work to tackle congestion on their services. Mr Baker said: ‘Climbing on a crowded train where there is little space . can often be an unpleasant experience. I will be monitoring these . services closely, and others which have not made the top ten list, and . urging train companies to reduce crowding on the busiest services.’ Richard Hebditch of the Campaign for Better Transport said: ‘There is a . real danger of cattle class travel becoming the norm on the most . congested routes. The latest statistics show how much of a problem . overcrowding continues to be. Year after year, fares go up faster than . wages yet many passengers find themselves having to stand in cramped . conditions.’ First Great Western managing director Mark Hopwood said it had added 4,500 extra seats from Paddington. The top ten most overcrowded trains in England and Wales were revealed today, shaming the worst offenders . At 52% over capacity, the South West Trains 7.14am service from Alton in Hampshire to Waterloo was ninth, while the 10th most-crowded service was another London Midland London-Birmingham evening rush-hour service - the 5.46pm Euston to Birmingham New Street, which was 52% over capacity. Publishing the data was ‘an important . tool to give increased transparency to passengers and help the industry . act to improve journeys.’ The . Department for Transport (DfT) said all train franchises require the . train operator to address overcrowding and ‘to plan their timetables in . such a way as to ensure, as far as possible, that crowding is not unduly . concentrated on any particular route or individual service. ‘ . It . said the ‘top ten’ list is based on ‘load factor’, which is defined as . the number of standard class passengers on a service expressed as a . percentage of the passenger capacity for that service. So a train which has the same number of passengers as its official capacity has  a ‘load factor’ of 100 per cent. In a bid to name and shame the worst offenders into action, Transport Minister Norman Baker, pictured, published new Government figures showing the top ten most overcrowded peak-time services . The Transport Department also set out the remedies that some of the train companies were taking  said of the most over-crowded service. It said: ‘First Great Western has recently strengthened the 07:44 service from Henley on Thames to London Paddington by adding an additional carriage, so that the number of standard class seats has increased to 340.’ It added: 'From this month London Midland is providing three Class 350/2 'high density' trains for the 18:13 service from London to Birmingham New Street.' This is to maximise the number of seats. ’In the long term, London Midland has 10 new 4 car trains on order that will allow them to operate additional trains on this route from 2014.’ Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: ‘Faster trains and better services are attracting record numbers of people to the railways, but the flipside is overcrowding on some routes. Train companies understand passengers' frustration when they cannot get a seat and operators are taking action where they can.’","Some trains are carrying up to 471 more passengers than designed to carry .

A baby reindeer looked set to miss out on all the reindeer games this Christmas when her antlers failed to grow. But luckily for six-month-old Kate, her inventive owner fashioned her a unique toupee. Now she will proudly lead the annual procession - wearing a stylish antler wig made with fake fur. I'll join in all the reindeer games! Kate looked set to have a miserable first Christmas until her clever owner crafted her a nifty antler wig to wear for the festivities . Faking it: Kate will lead a procession of 14 reindeers in Christmas performances in front of thousands of excited children . You'll go down in history! The little antlers look so natural on Kate that no one would know they weren't real . Kind-hearted Trevor Hill, 47, painstakingly crafted the fancy headpiece out of fake fur and old antlers so that Kate could appear at Santa's grotto. Her antlers should have grown in time for her to lead the procession of 14 reindeers in Christmas performances in front of thousands of excited children. Rather than disappoint anyone, Mr Hill spent hours in his workshop perfecting the special wig. Mr Hill said: 'People don't even notice that she's got anything other than real antlers which is the mark of how good the toupee is. Looking fly! Mr Hill spent hours in his workshop making the perfect wig for a sleigh ride . 'No-one knows when she is out and about during the shows - you can't tell the difference. She looks a lot happier now, at first she really looked like the odd one out. 'But I didn't want to disappoint the kids and she can now proudly lead the group as the head of the procession and leads the male reindeers around who pull the sleigh. 'We have got 14 reindeers and we use them for Santa's grottoes, special appearances and things like that.' The unusual wig was made from old antlers belonging to fellow reindeer Will before being attached onto a metal frame and secured with a leather strap. Mr Hill runs an animal sanctuary from his home in Bromyard, Herefordshire, where he lives with his wife Julia, 40, and two boys Stephen, 17, and Christopher, 12. The sanctuary also houses wild birds and reptiles. Grotto star: Kate's days of looking out of place because of her late-developing antlers are far behind her . Mr Hill revealed how Kate was named after The Duchess of Cambridge after being born on the anniversary of the Royal Wedding. Kate's fake antlers come from those shed by fellow reindeer Will, named after Prince William, who was born the morning of April 29, 2011 - they day the Royal couple got hitched. Mr Hill added: 'I guess its quite fitting that out of 14 reindeer it was Will who gave up his antlers for Kate. 'Will was born at 8.30am on the morning of the Royal Wedding. 'But we couldn't believe it when we had another born on the anniversary this year - we just had to call her Kate. They are brother and sister though.' Some of Mr Hill's other reindeer are named after Scooby Doo characters - his son's favourite cartoon. He added: 'We had Scooby and Shaggy imported from Sweden six years ago. We eventually got the entire cast with Daphinie, Velma and Fred. 'It's great for the kids as they all can identify with cartoon characters. 'There is another member of the team who is white so the boys called him Casper. But most of the girls are named after flowers such as Lilly, Poppy and Rosie.'","Headpiece is made from fake fur and an old pair of antlers .

Love: Raoul dwarfs his tiny guinea fowl friend Pengu but the pair are said to be inseparable . While Christmas may not be the happiest time of year for thousands of turkeys, one affectionate bird won't be featuring on the festive dining table - after striking up an unlikely friendship with a guinea fowl. The 44lbs turkey, called Raoul, has become inseparable from orphaned Pengu after they were born just days apart. Both birds were incubated by the same protective mother turkey after a guinea fowl laid an egg in her nest at Feufield Farm, in Symington, South Lanarkshire. The pair were raised and, despite their considerable size difference, have become best friends ever since. Farm owner Kim Adam, 54, said: 'We saved Raoul's mother Lola from the pot a couple of years ago and she has lived here ever since. 'They really are best friends. They even refuse to sleep apart. 'I don't think Pengu knows she's a guinea fowl because she won't go near the other birds that we have. She just stays by Raoul's side.' It was really love through the fence, it's extraordinary as guinea fowl like to wander and go where the mood takes them, but she's always at Raoul's side. 'To the average person, turkeys are quite ugly but they're actually very affectionate creatures. 'When people come to visit they jokingly ask ""Is he for Christmas or Thanksgiving dinner?"" but I tell them to wash their mouth out. 'Last Christmas, I tweeted as Raoul . saying that I was safe and sitting with my lady friend and I think I put . one or two people off their Christmas dinner. 'Raoul has a sense of humour and a lovely nature. He also can't resist a flirt with the other animals.' Kim rescued Raoul's parents Lola and Guissepe from a state of neglect on a turkey farm over two years ago. Raoul was born soon after, followed by best friend Pengu a few days later. Minder: 44lb Raoul often uses his large frame to protect Pengu from other animals . Inseparable: The pair of feathered friends spend all their time together and even bed down in the same hut . Raoul often uses his considerable size advantage to protect his feathered friend and the pair never fight, said Kim. She added: 'They could teach us humans a thing or two. 'It certainly is an unusual friendship and they are very popular among visitors to the farm. 'They . have grown up together and even now at the end of the day Raoul sits . outside and waits for us to put him into the same hut as Pengu. 'He won't sleep anywhere else. They are the best of friends.' The . five-acre farm, which has been open for five years, became a charitable . trust just over a year ago and employs people with disabilities and . learning difficulties to help care for the animals.

It's not helping us out much,' Sanders said. Sanders said another storm similar to the current one could bring additional snow on Christmas or the day after.","757 flights cancelled; 10,911 delayed across the U.S. by Friday evening .

In Britain, however, our leader has shown his  Russian counterpart how a real action man does it. This was David Cameron yesterday as he got a full soaking during a race along a  swollen icy stream in the Cotswolds. The Prime Minister sported a support  bandage on his right knee as he took part in the fund-raising competition close to his constituency home in Witney, Oxfordshire. Anything you can do Mr Putin... David Cameron braved muddy conditions and cold water in the Chadlington Brook Run . Feat: David Cameron took part in the Great Brook Run on Thursday afternoon . Tough: The Prime Minister was forced to climb through a low tunnel as part of the annual race . Success: Mr Cameron posed with his wife Samantha after receiving a medal for completing the race . The Great Brook Run requires . competitors to cover a course just over a mile long, and this year . involved considerably more water than usual thanks to recent heavy rain. The stream close to the village of . Chadlington, known as the Great Brook, was raging so much this year that . children normally allowed to compete were barred from wading through . some sections. Cut: The Prime Minister's knee support did not stop him sustaining a nasty-looking graze on his shin . Ready to go: Mr Cameron rubbed his hands in anticipation at the start line of the race . Victory! The exhausted politician was still happy to pose for photographs at the end of the race . Support: Well-wishers cheered on the Prime Minister as they took pictures of his exploits . Hilarity: The fun race is intended as a charity fund-raiser and ends at a local pub . Mr Cameron, however, was able to secure plenty of . photographs of himself  taming the torrent. The Prime Minister finished 46th out . of a field of 109 (a few places behind a man dressed as Father . Christmas) with a time of 18 minutes, 23 seconds. He was greeted by wife Samantha at the . end of the run at the Tite Inn. After asking his wife if she had any . money he announced he was  planning to have a burger to celebrate. At the end of the race, Mr Cameron was presented with the medal that is given to all competitors. The Great Brook Run, which was first held in 2006, starts and ends at the Tite Inn in Chadlington and aims to raise funds for local good causes. This year, the £5 entry fee was donated to the Chadlington Memorial Hall.

Last night, Mr Assange thanked his supporters, who stood in the street outside, some carrying lighted candles. He said: ‘Six months ago I entered this building. It has become my home, my office and my refuge. ‘Thanks to the principled stance of the Ecuadorian government and the support of its people, I am safe in this embassy and safe to speak from this embassy.’ He said he had been sustained by the solidarity of his supporters and people around the world supporting WikiLeaks and freedom of the press. ‘While my freedom is limited, I am still able to work and communicate, unlike the 232 journalists who are in jail tonight.’ Feeling victorious: Mr Assange's appearance marks the six-month anniversary of him entering the central London embassy in June 2012 . Strong support: A candlelight vigil was held outside the embassy as Julian Assange took to the balcony . Mr Assange is wanted for questioning in Sweden over allegations of sexual assault, which he denies. He fears being sent to the United States to be questioned over his whistle-blowing website. He said tonight that the Pentagon claimed recently that the existence of WikiLeaks was an ‘ongoing crime’. The Australian continued: 'While that remains the case and while my government will not defend the journalism and publishing of WikiLeaks, I must remain here. ‘However, the door is open, and the door has always been open, for anyone who wishes to use standard procedures to speak to me or guarantee my safe passage.' There was an added police presence outside the embassy and TV crews from  across the world filmed his speech. Wikileaks supporters outside the Ecuadorian Embassy last night were calling for Assange to be freed, believing his extradition to Sweden would lead to him being handed over to the U.S. Light for Assange: Wikileaks fans wait impatiently for Mr Assange to appear on the balcony . Some of Mr Assange’s friends and supporters listened to his speech from inside the embassy, which had a Christmas tree in the reception area and many cards dotted around. Mr Assange made special mention of Bradley Manning, the American soldier arrested over the leaking of military information. He said he wanted to salute reporters and publications which had covered arrests around the world of journalists and others. ‘It is from the revelation of the truth that all else follows. Our buildings can only be as tall as their bricks are strong. ‘And our civilisation is only as strong as its ideas are true. When our buildings are erected by the corrupt, when their cement is cut with dirt, when pristine steel is replaced by scrap, our buildings are not safe to live in.’ Mr Assange said WikiLeaks was under a continuing criminal investigation, but 2012 had been a 'huge year' for the organisation.","Julian Assange's appearance marked six-month anniversary at the embassy .

Tragic: Caitriona O'Leary, pictured, has died after being thrown from retired racehorse Mister, also pictured, which she was 'sharing' with another rider . A woman who had written articles warning about the dangers of riding other people’s horses died after falling from a thoroughbred she shared with its owner. Caitriona O’Leary suffered fatal head injuries after she lost control of the 15-hand former racehorse named Mister, an inquest was told. Witnesses said she may have tightened up and leaned forward, making the 12-year-old mount speed up, thinking it was in a race. Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Alan Craze said he would write to the British Horse Society about the dangers of sharing former racehorses. In a bitter twist, Miss O’Leary, 28, herself had warned about the potential dangers of ‘horse sharing’ – where an owner offers to share their animal in return for help with its care. In a newspaper interview in February she said: ‘There is a lot of trust involved. Owners will look you in the eye and tell you a horse is safe when they know it is a psycho.’ The article, which showed her pictured with Mister and owner Rebecca Fuller, 19, quoted Miss O’Leary as saying: ‘The owner is entrusting you with their horse, and you are entrusting them with your heart.’ On May 28, two shocked bystanders leapt into their cars and gave chase after Mister charged past them on a country lane with the Irish rider shouting ‘no, no, no’, the coroner heard yesterday. They found Miss O’Leary lying in the road. She had suffered multiple skull fractures despite wearing a riding hat. It is not clear if the horse threw her off or she jumped off voluntarily, the inquest in Eastbourne, East Sussex, was told. She was rushed by air ambulance from Magham Down in Hailsham, East Sussex, to the Royal London Hospital but died on June 1. The hearing heard that local resident June Axon found the rider on her back in the middle of the road. Shared: Caitriona O'Leary (right) and Becky Fuller (left) with Mister the horse, at Brent Farm, near Hailsham, East Sussex . Sad: Miss O'Leary was airlifted to the Royal London Hospital, pictured, and put on a life support machine, but she later died . The pensioner said she had not seen . what caused the horse to bolt but believed that the tragic death may . have been caused by rider error. Ms Axon said: ‘It is possible . something made him trot on and that  Caitriona tightened up and if she . tightened up, a racehorse is going to think “right I’ve got to go”. ‘She should have known that. If you . pull a racehorse’s head backwards and learn forwards, it’s going to go. I . guess that is initially what she did.’ Tragic: Caitriona was an experienced rider, but she may have been inexperienced in dealing with emergency situations . Coroners today recorded a verdict of accidental death for Caitriona O'Leary (pictured, far left) Equestrian: Her father said horses were Caitriona's 'passion' and she died 'doing what she loved' Susan Wilson, who had followed Miss . O’Leary in her car, said: ‘We put her in the recovery position and she . was breathing noisily when the ambulance arrived.’ Ms Wilson, an experienced equestrian, was asked about Miss O’Leary’s riding ability. ‘She didn’t seem to have the confidence to ride him,’ she said. ‘She always looked nervous and tentative and could not ride correctly. The horse would pick up on that. ‘This tragedy could have been avoided . had Caitriona not exaggerated her ability and her skills had been . assessed. Caitriona’s instinct was to grab hold of his head really . tightly and lean up its neck, which to racehorses means “go, go, go, . you’ve got to go faster”. I think that was why he was at full gallop.’ Miss Fuller, who was given Mister by her riding instructor, said the horse had a ‘lovely temperament’. Because she was studying at the University of Sussex, Miss Fuller . decided to seek a ‘sharing’ partner for Mister to help out with his . care. She said: ‘All was well. I rode out . with Caitriona on several occasions and she knew how to ride. I was . confident in her ability with horses.’ After the inquest, Miss O’Leary’s father, Patrick, said: ‘These things happen. It was an accident. ‘Riding horses was her passion. She died doing what she loved.’","Caitriona O'Leary, 28, died after her horse bolted in a country lane .

Four killers stabbed a teenager to death after chasing him out of a nightclub brandishing champagne and brandy bottles. Kelvin Chibueze, 17, rushed out of a  private party at an east London venue after he was attacked in a mass brawl involving knives and bar stools. But the youth tripped outside a Lidl supermarket and the rival gang members sat on his legs to stop him running away before stabbing him repeatedly with a foot-long blade. Dale Williams, 21, Lerone Boye, 25, Hugo . Nwankwo, 18, and Roger Damali, 31, denied murder but were today convicted . after a trial at the Old Bailey. A judge condemned Britain's 'endemic' knife culture as he jailed the four members of the Barking-based Harts Lane street gang for 93 years in total. A fifth man, deaf-mute Ibrahim Zakari, . 21, who threw a bottle at Kelvin during the chase, was earlier jailed . for two years - but walked free because he had already served more than a . year in jail on remand. Hours after the attack, David Cameron . pledged to 'wage a war' on gang culture in the capital in the aftermath . of last summer's London riots. Kelvin, from Croydon, was affiliated to the notorious Dagenham Boys gang and went by the street name Boss Don Gramz. A petty squabble over a girl is thought . to have started the row. Judge John Bevan QC said today: 'The veil of silence that has fallen over the main participants in this case speaks volumes as to the cowardice and moral bankruptcy of those on both sides of this argument. 'Carrying knives, at least three on each side, is a comparatively modern phenomenon, which is approaching an endemic state among feckless, aimless youths who think nothing of wielding and using of knives in the face of the slightest provocation or perceived insult.' Brutal: (From left) Hugo Nwankwo, 18, Lerone Boye, 25, and Roger Damali, 31, all denied murder and violent disorder but were convicted at the Old Bailey today . Vicious: Dale Williams, 21, denied murder but admitted violent disorder. He too was convicted and jailed for life after the quartet attacked Kelvin with bottles and sat on his legs to stop him escaping . It is thought violence flared inside the Arteflex nightclub, off Ilford High Road, on August 15 last year after derogatory comments were made about a girl, but Judge Bevan said the full reason will never be known. 'We are still none the wiser as to the cause, and whether of not it has to do with gang violence', he said. 'Whether there was rivalry, whether there was loyalty, whether it was revenge for a previous incident, I don't know.' The Old Bailey trial heard simmering tensions between two rival factions threatened to boil over at a 23rd birthday party at the 150-capacity venue, behind a converted shopfront. 'One group went into the rear garden to smoke a couple of times and whenever they returned, things appear to get either tenser or the atmosphere a little more strained', said Richard Whittam QC, prosecuting. The situation came to a head at around 4am, when Kelvin and five friends returned from the smoking area. 'The group was making its way back from the garden and was blocking the area between the entrance and the main room,' said Mr Whittam. 'There was a confrontation and knives were brandished. People were pushing and Kelvin Chibueze ran to the exit.' Gang warfare: The Old Bailey heard that it is thought that violence flared at the 23rd birthday party after derogatory comments were made about a girl . Kelvin was stabbed inside the club during a mass brawl, which spilled outside as gang members armed themselves with Champagne and Hennessey brandy bottles from behind the bar. The victim tried to flee but was chased into the car park of the Ilford Retail Park, close to Lidl, where he was attacked again and finally collapsed to the floor, crying, 'I can't breathe'. He was taken to The Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, but was pronounced dead. One of the wounds he received had pierced his lung. 'To say those originally in the dock did not know who inflicted the fatal injuries is nonsense', said Judge Bevan. 'That, of course, is a secret they are not going to divulge.' He also criticised Kelvin's friends who were with him that night for refusing to testify in court or help police investigate the murder. 'Witness after witness, with one solitary exception, lacked the necessary courage to advance the truth', he said. 'The victim's best friend declined to name those who stabbed Kelvin in the car park. 'His attitude as the best friend of the victim is made clear in his statement, where he says, if forced to go to court, I shall be rude and disruptive.' The judge identified Williams and Boye as ringleaders in the attack, while Nwankwo joined in the violence outside the club. He said all three carried knives. Damali, he said, probably joined in the attack out of loyalty to others rather than any direct involvement. Williams, of Barking, east London, was jailed for life, to serve a minimum of 26 years. He denied murder but admitted violent disorder. Boye, Damali, and Nwankwo all denied murder and violent disorder but were also convicted. Boye, of Ilford, was jailed for life, with a minimum of 28 years, while Damali, of East Ham, was jailed for life with a minimum of 23 years. Nwankwo, of Dagenham, who was 16 at the time of the murder, was sentenced to 16 years in a young offenders institute. Zakari, of Barking, was cleared of murder but convicted of violent disorder, having denied both charges. Joel Asare-Minta, of East Ham, and Diphy Menga, of Ilford, were both cleared of murder and violent disorder by a jury. Kongolo Kongola, of Plaistow, east London, was cleared of murder and violent disorder part-way through the trial due to lack of evidence.","Gang stabbed Kelvin Chibueze repeatedly with a foot-long blade .

Perhaps that attracted him to this book on Attila The Hun as he kept himself amused on a train journey with the Queen yesterday. The 91-year-old was seen clutching his unusual choice of holiday reading as he and the Queen sat with fellow first class passengers on their way to start their Christmas break at Sandringham. Rail royalty: The Queen and Prince Philip arrived at King's Lynn station ahead of their winter break at Sandringham House in Norfolk . Gripping read: Prince Philip clutches his copy of Christopher Kelly's book on Attila the Hun . The hardback book by Christopher Kelly entitled ‘The End of Empire, Attila The Hun And The Fall Of Rome’ was first published in 2010 and tells how the savage warrior king ravaged Rome in the 5th century. But the book also seeks to show him in a 'compelling new light', and was not just a savage barbarian who inflicted terror on whoever crossed his path. It was during the same break last year that the Prince was rushed to hospital after developing chest pains on Christmas Eve. Light reading: The book tells how the savage warrior king ravaged Rome in the 5th Century . Doctors inserted a small surgical stent to restore blood flow to his heart. Yesterday, the Queen and her husband discreetly joined more than 50 other unsuspecting passengers on the 10.45am train from King’s Cross station, London. The First Capital Connect service which had no buffet car or refreshments trolley went via Cambridge and arrived six minutes late at 12.26pm in King’s Lynn, Norfolk. The Queen, who was wearing a red and . white patterned coat, adjusted her trademark headscarf to protect her . form the wind and rain as she walked along the platform. She was followed by four aides carrying bags and the Duke with his book in his hand. The . couple then went through a side gate into a car park where a Range . Rover was waiting to drive them seven miles to Sandringham. Buckingham . Palace is thought to have booked all dozen seats in the rear first . class compartment of the train to ensure that the pair could sit . undisturbed with their staff. One way first class tickets on the train cost £50 each, although it would have been £33 if the Queen had used a senior railcard. One . passenger said: ‘It is amazing to think that we shared a train with the . Queen. I had no idea that she and Philip were on board until the train . stopped.’ Attila the Hun invaded the Roman Empire in search of wealth . The date of Attila the Hun's birth is not known, but for the last 20 years of his life he ruled the Hunnic empire, from 434AD to 453AD. A first-hand account of Attila by the Roman historian Priscus tells us that he was intelligent and extremely modest in his dress, although capable of violent outbursts of anger, which led to him being widely feared by the Roman Empire. His assaults on their eastern empire were carried out with the help of Goths, Gepids, Rugi, Heruli and others, who he all took under his command. From the Great Hungarian Plain Attila launched two major campaigns against the eastern empire in 442 and 447 AD, taking many of the major cities of the Balkans and defeating the imperial armies in open battle. In 451 and 452 AD, he ventured westwards, attacking Gaul and Italy, in raids designed to extract wealth. He died on the latest of many wedding nights in 453 AD, apparently from a haemorrhage. On his death, his sons quarrelled over succession and the Germanic subject peoples took the opportunity to reassert their independence. As a result the Hunnic empire waned and in 469 AD Attila's only surviving son, Hernac, himself sought asylum in the eastern empire.","Prince Philip was clutching his copy of Christopher Kelly's The End of Empire as he and the Queen arrived in Norfolk for their Christmas break .

Flat-screen TVs are injuring more kids today than anything.' His remarks, reported by Yahoo news, come just a week after 20-year-old Adam Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown and shot dead 20 children and six adult staff members. The massacre has led to calls for tighter gun restrictions in America where bearing arms is a constitutional right. Earlier this week President Barack Obama announced that Vice President Joe Biden will lead an effort to come up with policies to address gun violence . Mr Obama said that Mr Biden will work with members of his cabinet and other officials to come up with proposals by January - assuring the American public this is not merely a Washington commission to study the issue but promised real reforms in a timely manner. 'If we are not getting right keeping our children safe then nothing else matters,' the president said about the need for action and bi-partisan compromise. 'Lethal': The Texan politician claimed he has heard of people being killed playing ping pong and argued flat screen TVs are injuring kids more than anything else (stock image) Mr Kacal's comments come just a week after 26 people were killed by a lone gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, pictured . The Connecticut massacre was the fourth shooting rampage to claim multiple lives in the United States this year. The American public seemed numb after the school shooting and other Republican and Southern politicians, typically aligned with the powerful gun lobby, have said that something needed to be done to prevent future tragedies. One such lawmaker is Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The gun rights advocate said he would now be open to more regulation of military-style rifles like the one used in the Newtown shootings. Mr Obama said on Wednesday he found it 'encouraging that people of all different background and beliefs and  political persuasions' are willing to challenge past assumptions and address the issue of gun violence. Policy: President Barack Obama (on Sunday, at a memorial service for the victims and relatives of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting) will review gun policy in the aftermath of the horrific massacre . A memorial in Newtown features the names of all the deceased children on paper crosses . Christmas stockings with the names of shooting victims hang from railing near a makeshift memorial near the Newtown Christmas tree . He noted the 'strong tradition of gun ownership that has been handed down from generation to generation in the U.S.' and recognised the responsible, law-abiding gun owners in the U.S. but said more must be done to prevent guns from being illegally obtained and reaching the hands of the wrong people. But Mr Kacal, who opposed a bill instructing Texans how to secure their assault weapons, insists new gun restrictions are unnecessary. He said: 'People know what they need to do to be safe. We don't need to legislate that—it's common sense. Once everyone's gun is locked up, then the bad guys know everyone's gun is locked up.' Gun control has been a relatively low priority for most U.S. politicians due to the widespread popularity of guns in America and the clout of the National Rifle Association (NRA), the powerful gun industry lobby. The constitutional right to bear arms, listed in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, has continued to be upheld even after mass shootings in the past.

'You look at the list and it's all the classics ... the cream floats to the top,' he said, adding that the rankings were weighted to reflect the amount of reviews a film received, which could artificially boost or decline a score. Films from the 1960s and 1970s were notably absent from the list. Mr Atchity said studios were more focused at that time on work by big-name directors than on seasonal films. Directed by Frank Capra, 'It's a Wonderful Life' is based on the short story 'The Greatest Gift,' written by Philip Van Doren Stern in 1939. It has since become traditional viewing over Christmas in the US and across the world. The film focuses on the experiences of George Bailey (played by Stewart), who has given up his dreams in order to help others. His imminent suicide on Christmas Eve brings about the intervention of a guardian angel, called Clarence Odbody (played by Henry Travers). The guardian angel shows George Bailey how he has made a difference to the lives of others. The film caused some controversy at the time when the FBI issued a memo suggesting it had attempted to discredit bankers by casting Lionel Barrymore as a 'scrooge-type' character. This was a serious issue at a time when life in the US was consumed by anti-Communist paranoia, investigations and court trials. The film was nevertheless embraced by the American public, with Jimmy Stewart declaring it the favourite of his movies during an interview with Michael Parkinson in 1973.

He said that it was 'hard to articulate' his feelings on the Government's plan to legalise gay marriage and expected to receive 'no end of abuse' for expressing his views. In an interview with the Guardian, the 48-year-old said: 'I haven't done years of diversity training, so sometimes I say things which are probably tactless, and I don't mean to, to be honest, I don't mean to do that. 'But these feelings are hard to articulate, and the trouble is that if you try to, and get it wrong, which I probably, frankly, am doing now, you're going to get no end of abuse for it, and upset a whole load of people, some of whom I actually quite like.'

"By . Alex Gore . PUBLISHED: . 08:10 EST, 22 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:58 EST, 22 December 2012 . Suicide: An inquest heard Paul McCaffrey was found hanged at his Royal Hospital School home in Holbrook, after losing his job . A teacher hanged himself at a £30,000-a-year private school after being sacked for alleged heavy drinking, an inquest heard. Paul McCaffery, 46, lost his job as assistant director of music at the Royal Hospital School in Holbrook, Suffolk, in January this year. He was given notice to leave his house at the 680-pupil school by the end of the Easter holidays. Maintenance staff found Mr McCaffery, who had taught at the school for 20 years, hanging in his staff accommodation on March 29 after a friend got no reply the previous evening. The inquest in Ipswich heard Mr McCaffery was sacked for 'alcohol related' issues. His appeal against dismissal was turned down by headteacher Howard Blackett. Mr McCaffery's brother Philip said after the hearing that the teacher had been accused of being drunk at a Christmas dinner last year when he had simply fallen off his chair while pulling a Christmas cracker. He added that his brother's death could have been averted and demanded and apology from the school, which he claimed still had questions to answer. Recording a verdict of suicide, Suffolk Coroner Dr Peter Dean said: 'Concerns were raised about his response to losing his job, which was a very significant part of his life, and it is clear that losing his job meant losing his home.' A post-mortem found the cause of death to be compression of neck structures. Toxicology tests also found a raised alcohol level. The inquest heard that an assessment carried out by a mental health crisis team in February, did not find Mr McCaffery to be at risk of suicide. But the inquest heard how he had earlier been complaining of anxiety attacks and was prescribed beta-blockers by the school's doctor. Dr Dean said: 'The family said had they known more they would have taken further steps. We can't be certain that even if they had all the information this tragedy could have been averted. Historic: Royal Hospital School opened in 1715 and has fees of up to £30,000-a-year for boarders . 'The school went through a process they felt they had to go through. They shared some information but some things they couldn't share because of patient confidentiality. It was a difficult decision for the school to take about a valuable member of staff. 'It does appear beyond reasonable doubt, Paul intended the consequences of his actions and I record a verdict that Paul McCaffery took his own life.' Dr Dean said he would be writing to the school to remind them of the need 'to look at all aspects of vulnerability' when making decision about staff. He said: 'Clearly it was a hard decision for the school but we need to raise the awareness - that is not to imply any liability on the school's part.' Mr McCaffery's brother Philip said after Thursday's inquest at the IP-City centre in Ipswich that there were still questions that needed to be answered by the school and he would be seeking a meeting with the school's trustees - Greenwich Hospital. He said: 'I think Paul's death could have been averted. If I had all the information to hand I don't think Paul would be dead now. Hanged: Maintenance staff found Mr McCaffery dead in his staff accommodation at the school . 'The school had pre-conceived ideas about Paul having drinking problems which clouded his dismissal. I'm disappointed nobody from the school apart from the doctor attended today. There's a big void of answers the family is still seeking. 'Looking back, he didn't have a drink problem, he had mental health issues. The school could have kept the family better informed without breaking patient confidentiality. 'I want the school to apologise and admit more could have been done. He was a larger-than-life character and loved by so many, including parents and pupils. He has helped so many people to achieve their goals, not just in music but in life.' The school, founded in 1715 to educate the sons of seafarers, has boarding fees of £29,937-a-year, which are heavily discounted for the children of Royal Navy personnel. Nobody from the Royal Hospital School was available for comment.","Paul McCaffery had also been told to leave his Royal Hospital School home .

The mother of Kelsey Dawn Raffaele, the 17-year-old driver who died in a car crash while talking on her cell phone, is praising the bi-partisan legislation passed in Michigan on Friday to ban cell phone use by beginner drivers. Bonnie Raffaele said she is 'deeply grateful' that Republicans and Democrats reached across the aisle to pass 'Kelsey's Law' before the end of the legislative session. Loss: Kelsey Dawn Raffaele, in 2009, was killed in a crash in 2010 when she was chatting on her cell phone while driving . The devastated mother launched a mission to prevent the tragedy she experienced when her teenage daughter was killed on a winter morning in 2010. She had been chatting on her cell phone when driving home from a friend's house. Raffaele said she won a bittersweet victory when the Michigan Legislature passed a bill prohibiting young novice drivers from using a cell phone while behind the wheel. Kelsey was a Level 2 driver when she . crashed. She had just passed a slower-moving vehicle on a slippery road . near her high school and went too far to the right, clipping a snow . bank, her mother said. She apparently overcompensated by jerking the . wheel to the left and veered into an oncoming car. 'She was on the phone. It was a . classic case of a distracted driver,' said Bonnie Raffaele, a computer . technician for the Eastern Upper Peninsula Intermediate School District. Still grieving a year later, she . chatted with a friend who was a state police officer. 'I guess I was at . the angry point. I said, 'Something has to be done. I have to get to the . kids. They have to pay attention and stop this.'' The measure, which at one point appeared in trouble because of opposition from House Speaker Jase Bolger, won final approval a few hours before lawmakers adjourned in December. Thirty-two states have similar laws. Gov. Rick Snyder said on Friday he was 'generally supportive' of what officially would be known as 'Kelsey's Law.' 'I will most likely end up signing it. The concept is a good one,' Snyder said during a year-end news conference, noting that he also has a 16-year-old daughter named Kelsey, who got her license last summer. The next step, Raffaele said, will be spreading the word to parents, police, teachers and anyone else in a position to make a difference - especially teens themselves. 'I'm a firm believer that nobody . should be on the phone when they're driving, but my big concern is the . kids,' said Raffaele, 48, who lives in the Upper Peninsula town of Sault . Ste. Marie. 'They're the most vulnerable, the most inexperienced.' The . bill applies to holders of Level 1 licenses, who must be accompanied by . a parent, guardian or another licensed driver at least 21 years old, . and those with Level 2 licenses, who can drive alone with some limits on . hours and carrying young passengers. It exempts Level 3 drivers, who . have full privileges. 32 states have already enacted laws banning cell phone use for teen drivers. Scroll down for video. For Kelsey: Bonnie Raffaele (right) was resolved to do everything she could to prevent the tragedy of losing her daughter, Kelsey (left) With her husband, Ron, Raffaele . created a website devoted to warning teens of the danger. She hit the . road, speaking at schools as far away as Grand Rapids. And she enlisted . state Sen. Howard Walker, a Traverse City Republican whose district . includes the Sault Ste. Marie area, to sponsor the cell phone . legislation. 'I am so excited, so relieved,' said a grateful Raffaele. While . savoring the outcome, she continues to struggle with the loss of . Kelsey, whose twin sister, Courtney, is a student at Northern Michigan . University in Marquette. 'To . this day, I find myself thinking she's still at a friend's house,' Raffaele said.

Mr Baimbridge, an IQ test . administrator, had been asked to explain why the testing was unreliable. After saying that most IQ tests would have ‘Mr and Mrs Average scoring . 100’ he added that if your IQ is ‘somewhere around 60 then you are . probably a carrot’. The remark initially drew a smile from . Louise Minchin, but she and co-host Charlie Stayt then read out some of . the complaints on air. At the end of the programme they . apologised for the remarks and read out a personal apology from Mr . Baimbridge. One viewer, an employee of learning disability charity . Mencap, said she was ‘shocked’ and ‘disgusted’ by the comments. Ciara Evans, who has a learning disability, said: ‘I am shocked that someone has described people like me as carrots.

A BBC spokesman . said: ‘Clearly we do not condone the comments that were made in any way . and sincerely apologise for the offence caused.’ Mensa was founded in England in 1946 by Roland Berrill, a barrister, . and Lance Ware, a scientist and lawyer, who wanted to form a society for . people with a high IQ. It has over 110,000 members worldwide, and to become a member of, . you must score in the top two percent of the population on a properly . administered IQ test. Members include Carol Vorderman, whose IQ is 154, and Jimmy Savile was a member of the society. One its its best known members is Sir Clive Sinclair (right), who was chairman . for 17 years from 1980 to 1997. Computer pioneer Sinclair was even . briefly engaged to 21-year-old accountant and fellow Mensa-member . Bernadette Tynan (IQ 154) in 1989. Mensa has been riddled with infighting and scandal since it was founded. Julie Baxter from Lancashire with an IQ of 154, was appointed chair in . 1997 supposedly to change everything - but after nine months was booted . out, saying the committee was obsessed with 'self-aggrandisement and the . pursuit of power for its own sake', and that some of the men on it are . 'sad people with no social life' who are obsessed with Mensa. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . What your IQ score means . IQ, meaning intelligence quotient, is a test to assess intelligence. The term was originally coined by German psychologist William Stern. A score of 90-100 is considered an average IQ. IQs between 110-120 are considered to show superior intelligence. IQs greater than 140 are said to signify genius, with scientist Stephen Hawking predicted to have the highest IQ achievable of 161. People with IQs below 70 are said to have learning difficulties . Mensa, founded in 1946 as a society . for people with a high IQ, apologised via its website for the ‘totally . inappropriate’ comment which ‘does not represent the society’s official . position or view’. It emphasised that Mr Baimbridge had apologised and . had not intended any offence. Chief executive John Stevenage added . that Mensa ‘fully recognises that it is not what level of mental ability . someone has but what they do with it that is the real achievement in . life’. Mensa, founded in England in 1946 by barrister Roland Berrill and scientist Dr Lance Ware, represents those whose IQs are in the ‘top two per cent of the population’. The society, which welcomes members of any age, has the aim of providing ‘stimulating intellectual and social environment for its members’ and hoping to encourage ‘human intelligence for the benefit of humanity’. Complaints: The presenters read out complaints about the comments later in the programme. One viewer described the comment as 'insulting' Dreadful: Users on Twitter complained about the comment made on BBC Breakfast . The society also exists globally through umbrella organisation Mensa international. High-profile . members have included television presenter Carol Vorderman, anti-virus . software pioneer John McAfee and Jimmy Savile. Other recognisable members, known as Mensans, include director Quentin Tarantino and actors Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin. Mr Bainbridge’s comment drew derision online, with users taking to Twitter to complain about the comparison between somebody with a low IQ and a carrot. Rich Jobling wrote: ‘Proof that being clever can make you look stupid’, while Amanda Price said: ‘very concerned that the man from Mensa described someone with an IQ of 60 as being a carrot. This is highly offensive .’ Internet users described Mr Bainbridge’s remark as ‘disgraceful’ and ‘dreadful’, while one user, referring to himself as Markwell, wrote: ‘Mensa you have an idiot as an ambassador’.

Found: The New York Post tracked down Tawana Brawley, pictured, in Hopewell, Virginia, 25 years after her historic gang rape hoax . Twenty-five years after Tawana Brawley's claims of being raped by a gang of white men polarised New York City, the woman has been tracked down living in hiding in Virginia. On November 28, 1987, the then-15-year-old was found in a trash bag, dazed, smeared with feces with the word n****r scrawled on her body. She told police she had been abducted by two white men and driven to the woods where they and four others ravaged her for four days - one of which had a badge. The case was catapulted onto the national stage by attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason, and the then-little-known Rev. Al Sharpton, who claimed she was raped 33 times. Celebrities weighed in, with Bill Cosby posting a $25,000 reward for information on the case, Don King promised $100,000 for Brawley’s education and boxer Mike Tyson gave her a $30,000 watch to ease her pain. Fishkill Police Officer Harry Crist Jr. was implicated after being found dead in his apartment a week after Brawley was discovered, and Dutchess County prosecutor Steven Pagones was also accused when he stepped in with an alibi for the 28-year-old. But in 1988 a grand jury found the whole shocking story was a hoax, and Brawley was never raped. Now 40 years old, The New York Post has tracked her down working as a nurse in Virginia. 'I don't want to talk to anyone about that,' Brawley told the newspaper recently as she emerged from her apartment in Hopewell, Virginia, wearing scrubs.

She lives what appears to be a relatively normal life in a neatly kept brick apartment complex with signs warning of video surveillance cameras. To avoid detection, Brawley goes by the aliases of Thompson and Gutierrez and has a young daughter, a neighbor told the Post. She reportedly works as a licensed practical nurse at The Laurels of Bon Air in Richmond. But her co-workers have been in the dark about the incredible story of brutality, which turned out to be false. 'Are you serious? We don't know her by that name. Isn't that a trip?' one staffer said, adding that the woman who they call Tawana Gutierrez was 'a good worker.' According to a neighbor, Brawley has lived in Hopewell - Virginia's most crime-laden town - for at least a year. 'Tawana V. Gutierrez' and 'Tawana V. Thompson' have held the same nursing license since 2006, state records show. The Virginia Board of Nursing confirmed issuing it to a 'Tawana Vacenia Thompson Gutierrez.' False claims: Brawley, picturd in 1988, claimed she was gang raped by a group of white men, one of whom had a badge . Rally: Tawana Brawley, left in 1988, of Wappinger Falls, N.Y., was the center of the legal controversy over her rape charges . Brawley maintains a PO box in Claremont, Va., under the name Gutierrez, according to The Post's sources. The grand jury panel, which heard from 180 witnesses over its seven-month investigation, found that Brawley made up the story to avoid being punished for staying out late and missing school. They found evidence she had ran away from home and was hiding out in her parents' former apartment after they got evicted. Many believed that Brawley feared her stepdad Ralph King's and needed an alibi for her absence. King spent seven years in prison in the 1970s for killing his first wife. Traces of the charcoal-like material used to scrawl the hateful word on her body were found under her fingernails, and she showed no signs of genital trauma or exposure, the jury found. One witness said Brawley was spotted climbing into the bin bag. We believe you: The case polarised new York City in the late 1980s . Lawsuit: Tawana Brawley, pictured in 1997, spoke at a rally in support of Alton Maddox who lost a lawsuit for defamation of character by Steven Pagones . 'It is probable that in the history of this state, never has a teenager turned the prosecutorial and judicial systems literally upside down with such false claims,' state Supreme Court Justice S. Barrett Hickman wrote at the time. Pagones has tried to forget the sorry affair but says he can't. 'It'll come up randomly. It'll come up when something happens with Sharpton,' he told The Post. Pagones won a defamation lawsuit against Sharpton, Brawley and her lawyers in 1998. Maddox was found liable for $97,000, Mason for $188,000, and Sharpton was ordered to pay $66,000. Brawley was ordered to pay $190,000 at 9 per cent annual interest but hasn't paid any of that bill. In total, she owes $429,000. He continues to look for her. 'Through her silence, she's as guilty of libel as Maddox, Mason and Sharpton,' he told the newspaper. 'The only way to hold her accountable — at least at this stage — is financially.'","Brawley, 40, has been found living a relatively normal life in Hopewell, Virginia .

The distraught police chief of Newtown has spoken about the absolute 'carnage' he witnessed as one of the first responders inside Sandy Hook Elementary School. Police Chief Michael Kehoe said that he was lost for words as he made his way round the building and said that the tragic shooting at the school was 'devastating, absolutely devastating.' Describing the harrowing scene when he entered one classroom in the Connecticut school where shooter Adam Lanza had killed 14 1st graders and their teacher, Kehoe said it was obvious that no one had survived. Scroll Down for Video . Police Chief Michael Kehoe said that he was lost for words and distraught upon entering Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in the immediate aftermath of the shooting massacre . 'It was a very tragic observation on all parts, because then you could see the carnage that was present,' said Kehoe to CBS News about the massacre in which 20 children and six staff members lost their lives at the hands of 20-year-old Lanza. 'It was devastating, absolutely devastating. I had no words, I felt a little bit of anger towards the person who had done this. Revealing that officers from Newtown police had to force their way in through the back of the school, Kehoe said that the school was erie and quiet as police stalked through the corridors with their guns drawn. 'We needed to break into the school to get in because the back doors are secured. We broke out the window,' said Kehoe. 'If the room was locked that means that the teachers had done their job, locked their doors and hid their children from danger.' Kehoe told CBS News that by the time he had arrived Lanza was immobilised, but explained that his main emotion was regret that he couldn't have been there to stop the killing. 'Well you feel a sense of guilt that you weren't there quick enough to do that but i also know that our response stopped the threat where he was and he could not proceed any further,' said Kehoe. Also present during the harrowing interview was Newtown Police Captain Joe Rios who was stationed outside the school as Chief Kehoe entered.

'It was miraculous, I kept seeing children coming out of the building and I kept wanting more to come out and more,' said Rios. 'I walked in and it was horrific, the crime scene itself and to see the adults and the children that were deceased in the classrooms - it was very hard obviously to comprehend what had happened.' Adding to the tragedy, Chief Kehoe admitted that the year before he had visited the school to read a story to a class of Kindergarten students, some of whom would most likely have perished in the mass shooting. 'I may have read to some of these students that may have perished or not and that kind of hit me hard,' said Kehoe.

No sooner have predictions of one Mayan apocalypse passed by without incident, another has surfaced to keep the doomsday faithful believing. Just two days after the much-anticipated end of the world failed to materialise, one historian has re-ignited the debate by claiming that Armageddon could come tomorrow instead. Many apocalypse believers were left red-faced when the December 21 date they so publicly announced as the end went without a hitch. But Nikolai Grube, a leading expert in . Mesoamerican advanced civilisations from the University of Bonn, . believes interpretations of the Mayan calendar may actually be off by a few days. More of this on Christmas Eve? Men dressed in 'martian' outfits pictured on December 21 in the village of Bugarach, France, where some thought an alien spacecraft would emerge to save them from the Mayan apocalypse that never materialised . Optimistic: Guatemalans host celebrations marking the end of the Mayan age at the Tikal archaeological site on December 21. An historian believes the end could actually come on Christmas Eve instead . The original calculations were based on the Mayan long count calendar, which pin-pointed the end of the 13th baktun on December. A baktun is equivalent to around 144,000 days or 394 years. But Mr Grube says matching up our own present-day calendar with that of the Mayans is not an exact science and a deviation of a few days to Christmas Eve is plausible. He also casts further doubt on there even being a Mayan prediction of an apocalypse at all. He said several Mayan texts have been deciphered which mention days well beyond this Christmas. Mr Grube told ABC News: 'You find dates in Mayan texts that are thousands or millions of years into the future.' All over again: Nikolai Grube, an historian from the University of Bonn, says calculations based on the Mayan Long Count calendar (above) that predicted December 21 as the apocalypse may have been off by a few days . Cult following: Crowds also gathered in Times Square, New York, in anticipation of the so-called Mayan Apocalypse on December 21 . For centuries, the ending of the Mayan calendar, which supposedly occurred on December 21, has been taken as a sign of an impending Armageddon.

The Queen missed church today after being hit by a nasty bug, but insists she will be well enough to celebrate Christmas. The 86-year-old monarch has been laid low by a illness which a spokesman described yesterday as 'the tail end of a heavy cold'. Yet it was enough to make her miss Sunday service at Sandringham for the first time in living memory, much to the disappointment of a crowd of 100 well-wishers who waited outside the 11am service at St Mary Magdalene Church. Service: Prince Philip arrives without The Queen but with Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie . Tradition: Prince Philip is joined by Prince Andrew, Prince Edward, Sophie Wessex and Lady Louise Windsor . Other members of the Royal family led by Prince Philip, 91, did attend the service, however, walking the few hundred yards from Sandringham House. Philip was accompanied by Prince Andrew, his daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, Prince Edward, his wife Sophie, Countess of Wessex and their nine-year-old daughter Lady Louise Windsor. Hayley Shaw of Norwich, Norfolk, who was in the crowd, said: 'A member of the Royal entourage came out just before the service and told everyone that the Queen would not be coming. 'Somebody said they had come all the way from Wales and the aide replied that he was sure the Queen would be at church as normal on Christmas Day. 'When Sophie Wessex came out of the church, I overheard her talking to the vicar, suggesting that someone had a sore throat and would have found it hard to sing. I guess she was talking about the Queen. It was a disappointment not to see the Queen and it made me a little bit worried about her - but Philip was looking very healthy.' Well-wishers: Prince Philip and Prince Andrew outside the church, where around 100 people had gathered . Illness: The Queen was absent at the church service for the first time in living memory . Missed: A spokesman described The Queen's illness as the 'tail end of a cold' Another onlooker added: 'Word went around a few minutes before the service that the Queen would not be in attendance - but no explanation was given. 'It left everyone wondering what the problem could be. The Queen is normally a stickler for routine and nobody can remember her missing a service here before. 'But Prince Philip and the other Royals seemed quite happy and were smiling which suggested it might not be anything too serious.' A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: 'She is getting over the tail end of a cold. That is why she was not at church today. 'It will certainly be business as usual next week. She hopes to be at church on Tuesday for the Christmas Day service - absolutely.' Public appearance: The Queen was last seen in public boarding a train to Norfolk in London three days ago . The Royal party walked back to . Sandringham House after the 45 minute service. Eugenie and Beatrice . stopped to accept gifts of flowers from several children. An estate worker at Sandringham said: 'This has taken everyone by surprise. Apparently the Queen was fine on Saturday when she gave out Christmas presents to staff.' The Queen was last seen in public on Thursday when she and Prince Philip caught a train from King's Cross to King's Lynn, Norfolk, at the start of her Sandringham break. Last year Prince Philip fell ill over Christmas at Sandringham. He underwent surgery to have a stent inserted into a blocked artery and spent four nights in hospital. The Queen traditionally spends the . festive period with her family gathered around her at her Norfolk . estate. But this year there will be some empty spaces around the table . on Christmas Day. Happy family: 'The other Royals were smiling which suggested it might not be anything too serious' Stroll in the park: The Royals walked the few hundred yards to the church from Sandringham House . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are planning to spend Christmas at the Middleton family home. And Prince Harry is currently serving as an Apache pilot in Afghanistan. Yesterday, St James's Palace said Prince William and his pregnant wife are to spend the day privately in Bucklebury, Berkshire - a decision taken with the approval of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. But the pair do plan to visit Sandringham at some point over the festive period. Kayleigh Allen, nine, who was standing in the crowd outside the church, brought a special soft toy labelled My First Toy for the pregnant Duchess.

Archivists at the county's records' office have discovered a brief archive entry that states Father Christmas was laid to rest at a churchyard in the village of Dedham on May 30, 1564. It simply reads: 'The 30th Day, Father Christmas was buried.' Deep in the archive: Historians have discovered that Father Christmas died in the mid 16th Century . Festive find: By 1881 the surname Christmas was still largely concentrated in the south east of England . Laid to rest: The churchyard in Dedham where Father Christmas was buried in 1564 . A spokesman for Essex Record Office said that careful searching had uncovered a whole host of Christmas family members living in the county - well known for its reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex . He said: 'Christmas was not an uncommon surname in these parts around that time. Don't panic: Everyone knows the real Father Christmas is alive and living at the North Pole . 'It appears with some frequency in north Essex and south Suffolk - by 1881 the name was still largely concentrated in the south east of England. 'The title 'father' is most likely the usage given in The Oxford English Dictionary as 'a respectful title given to an old and venerable man'. Other Essex entries for the Christmas family in the 16th and 17th Century included a farmer, an inn holder, a brewer, a carpenter and a family of bailiffs. The spokesman added: 'To live to an old age was quite an achievement for Father Christmas in 1564 - only about one half to one third of people lived to see their 16th birthday, but if you survived that long you might live to see 50 or 60.' Luckily Christmas will not have to be cancelled this year though as everyone knows the real Father Christmas lives at the North Pole. The festive tradition began as part of old English midwinter festival with Old Father Christmas being the bringer of Spring who enjoyed feasting while dressed all in green. Looking back: The Dedham parish record recording when Father Christmas was buried. Book worms: Careful searching by archivists uncovered a host of Christmas family members . Popular: Christmas was not an uncommon surname in north Essex in the 16th Century . This character was also the inspiration for the Ghost of Christmas Present in Charles Dickens' tale A Christmas Carol. The modern imagining of Father Christmas - or Santa Claus - as a tubby bearded man dressed in a red and white suit borrows heavily from the Dutch Saint Nick, Sinterklaas, who delivers presents to children on December 6. Contrary to popular belief, Coca Cola's famous Christmas advertising campaigns did not give him his famous red and white outfit - it was merely a lucky coincidence. Father Christmas is known in countries across the globe including Brazil (Papai Noel), France (Phre Nokl), Italy (Babbo Natale), India (Baba Christmas), Portugal (Pai Natal) and Spain (Papa Noel).

President Obama allegedly threatened Speaker John Boehner with a public shaming if he held up a compromise on the fiscal cliff negotiations. Mr Obama reportedly said that he was willing to blame the failed negotiations on stubborn Republicans in either his inauguration speech or the state of the Union if the two parties were unable to reach an equitable decision. The Wall Street Journal reports that Mr Obama made the threat a number of times, and though nothing has been formally decided as the deadline looms one week from today, the move would be a drastic one, and seen by many as a divisive way to head into his second term. Scroll down for video . Not happy with threats: President Obama reportedly grew frustrated with Speaker John Boehner and said that if they didn't strike a deal he would blame the Republicans in his Inaugural address . One of the points where President Obama became frustrated with Mr Boehner came when the Speaker said that he expected some show of gratitude or concession after he reportedly handed over $800billion from tax revenue earnings. That was promptly shot down by the President, with him allegedly retorting: 'You get nothing. I get that for free.' On Capitol Hill, some Republicans worry about the practical and political implications should the GOP block a compromise designed to avoid tax increases for most Americans and cut the nation's deficit. 'It weakens the entire Republican Party, the Republican majority,' Representative Steven LaTourette, a Republican from Ohio, said Thursday night shortly after rank-and-file Republicans rejected Boehner's 'Plan B' - a measure that would have prevented tax increases on all Americans but million-dollar earners. U.S. President Barack Obama delivers a statement on the fiscal cliff at the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House Thursday . President Barack Obama speaks to reporters about the fiscal cliff in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington . 'I mean it's the continuing dumbing down of the Republican Party and we are going to be seen more and more as a bunch of extremists that can't even get a majority of our own people to support policies that we're putting forward,' LaTourette said. 'If you're not a governing majority, you're not going to be a majority very long.' Republicans are not the only ones bracing for a less-than-stellar situation, as President Obama has reportedly  scaled back his ambitions for a sweeping budget bargain with . Republicans. Instead, he's calling for a limited measure sufficient to . prevent the government from careening off the 'fiscal cliff' in January . by extending tax cuts for most taxpayers and forestalling a painful set . of agency budget cuts. In a White House . appearance Friday, Obama also called on Congress to extend jobless . benefits for the long-term unemployed that would otherwise be cut off . for 2 million people at the end of the year. The future looked bright: The pair met in November, and were seemingly happy, but the same cannot be said now . Obama's . announcement was a recognition that chances for a larger agreement . before year's end have probably collapsed. It also suggested that any . chance for a smaller deal may rest in the Senate, particularly after the . collapse of a plan by Speaker Boehner to permit tax . rates to rise on million-dollar-plus incomes. 'In the next few days, . I've asked leaders of Congress to work toward a package that prevents a . tax hike on middle-class Americans, protects unemployment insurance for . 2 million Americans, and lays the groundwork for further work on both . growth and deficit reduction,' President Obama said.

Lost time: 'I honestly 100 percent believe my son would be here if that time had not been wasted,' Tiffany Doty said . Just a week ago, Thomas Doty was showing promise and improving daily after a stay in a California Hospital specializing in difficult cancer cases, his mother said. ‘I honestly believed...and the doctors we were working with believed wholeheartedly that they could save Thomas' life,’ she said. The woman’s misleading promise came after Johnathan Hillstrand of ‘the Deadliest Catch’ TV show, a friend of the family, reached out to his fans and asked them to help Thomas Doty. Mrs Doty says her family had recently come into financial hardship, including foreclosure on their home, and were unable to cover the $50,000 doctors needed to perform a special surgery. He tried to help: The woman¿s misleading promise came after Johnathan Hillstrand of 'the Deadliest Catch' TV show, a friend of the family, reached out to his fans and asked them to help Thomas Doty . The unknown culprit, who claimed to be an Indiana nurse, emailed Mrs Doty saying she was going to send a check for $250,000 to pay for the treatment. But after eight weeks of back and forth phone calls and reassurances, the money never arrived and the false guarantee pushed back Thomas Doty’s surgery, Mrs Doty says. Lost time: 'I honestly 100 percent believe my son would be here if that time had not been wasted,' she said. Mrs Doty said she believes the woman lied in an attempt to please Mr Hillstrand. 'Shoot for the stars': Thomas Doty's 'favorite quote was, ""Shoot for the stars...see you in heaven,"" his mother said. 'She would get on the phone with me and say, “I'm so sorry for what you’re going through and did you tell Thomas the wire is on the way?”’ Mrs Doty said. The family's attorney told KOMO 4 News that if he can track down the woman, he will take her to court for intentional infliction of emotional distress and potential criminal charges. Mrs Doty says the woman is even now harassing her family after the death of their son. They plan to contact police after laying their son to rest.

The death is the third in Britain linked to an outbreak of anthrax among drug users believed to have used contaminated heroin . A woman has died after injecting herself with heroin contaminated with anthrax. An inquest has been opened after Claire Skelton, 42, from Rochester, Kent, died at King's College Hospital in London on December 9. The cause of death was given as anthrax and intravenous drug abuse. Her death is the third in Britain linked to an outbreak of anthrax among drug users believed to have used contaminated heroin. The Health Protection Agency said 13 cases of anthrax among people who inject drugs have been reported in several European countries since June. Six of the cases have occurred in the UK, including four in England, one in Scotland and one in Wales. Earlier this year, two drug users died in Blackpool after contracting the bacterial infection. The HPA said the source of the infection is presumed to be contaminated heroin. Anthrax is an acute bacterial infection that normally infects humans when they inhale or ingest anthrax spores. Dr Fortune Ncube, an expert in infections among people who inject drugs at the Health Protection Agency, said: 'Anthrax can be cured with  antibiotics, if treatment is started early. 'It is therefore important for medical . professionals to be alert to the possibly of anthrax infection in heroin . users presenting with signs and symptoms - which include severe soft . tissue infections or blood poisoning - to prevent any delays in . providing treatment. Anthrax (pictured) is an acute bacterial infection that normally infects humans when they inhale or ingest anthrax spores . 'It is possible that further cases may be seen in people who inject heroin. 'People who use drugs may become infected with anthrax when the heroin they use is contaminated with anthrax spores. 'This could be a source of infection if injected, smoked or snorted - there is no safe route for consuming heroin or other drugs that may be contaminated with anthrax spores.' Dr James Sedgwick, interim director of the HPA’s Kent Health Protection Unit, said: 'In light of this recent case in Medway, we have advised local agencies to talk to their service users who inject drugs about the risk of anthrax infection. 'People who inject drugs often experience skin infection but we strongly advise them not to ignore signs such as redness or excessive swelling around injection sites, or other symptoms of general illness such a high temperature, chills, severe headaches or breathing difficulties. 'They should seek medical advice quickly in such circumstances generally but particularly now because we have concerns that some batches of heroin in circulation may be contaminated with anthrax. Early treatment with antibiotics is essential for a successful recovery.'",Death is the third in Britain linked to an outbreak of anthrax amongst people using heroin .

One of the first ever Ferraris ever made, and possibly the slowest, went on sale today with a price tag of £750,000.

The third oldest Ferrari in the UK, the car is sure to appeal to collectors who don't mind shelling out a pretty penny on it. While it may be a collector's item its engine is more akin to the modern Mondeo as it has a modest 2-litre V12 140bhp engine and a top speed of just 105mph.

'Mistake': Daemon Johnson said he pressed the wrong key on his phone following a 12-hour shift . A police inspector who was sacked after he posted a picture of his penis on Facebook today claimed he had meant to text the saucy photo to his girlfriend - but pressed the wrong button. Shamed Northamptonshire officer Daemon Johnson, 45, was fired after stunned staff spotted the explicit image on the social networking site. Today, Mr Johnson described himself as a '20th-century copper in a 21st-century force'. The force veteran - who has been in the job for 25 years - was dismissed for gross misconduct last week following a disciplinary hearing. The professional standards panel also found that he had sent inappropriate emails and made lewd comments to female members of staff. He said he intended to send the rude photograph as a text message to his partner - but accidentally posted it on her Facebook page after a 12-hour shift in April. He said: 'It has been dreadful having this hanging over my head for the past few months. 'I made a mistake on my phone keypad and I have paid for that mistake with my career. 'I have been inundated with messages of support from all over the place, a huge number of them from colleagues. 'But I've also had great support from ordinary members of the public living in the areas in which I served. I feel choked thinking about it, I feel very humbled. 'Although I understand the Professional Standards panel's decision, I consider this wholly disproportionate to the matters that I was held to account for. 'I have at no time been suspended and was actively engaged in policing right up to my dismissal. 'I have 25 years of excellent service and put in place a number of innovative community schemes in Northampton that benefit those who may be disadvantaged or at risk of harm.' Mr Johnson refused to confirm whether he would take his case to appeal. He said his partner had stood by him throughout the months of investigation - during which the inquiry team had trawled through every email and text message he had sent. Mr Johnson added he felt 'embarrassed' by the affair and regretted that his 70-year-old father had learned of the story while watching a TV news bulletin. Veteran: The 45-year-old described himself as a '20th-century copper in a 21st-century force' Last week, Superintendent Jan Meagher, Northamptonshire Police's head of professional standards, confirmed Mr Johnson had been sacked. Supt Meagher said: 'The matters breached the standards of professional behaviour, namely ""discreditable conduct"" and ""equality and diversity"". 'The panel decided that the most appropriate outcome was dismissal. We expect the highest standards from our officers and staff. 'We will take robust action in cases where we find the standard expected has not been upheld. 'As with all disciplinary hearings, every officer has a right to appeal.' Career-ending error: Mr Johnson said he was 'embarrassed' by the affair and regretted that his 70-year-old father had learned of the story while watching the news.

BBC business editor Robert Peston said he was heart-broken last night after his late wife’s wedding and engagement rings were stolen in a burglary. Mr Peston’s wife, the author Sian Busby, died aged 51 in September after losing a five-year battle with lung cancer. The award-winning journalist appealed for the return of the ‘irreplaceable’ family heirlooms which were taken along with other jewellery, two laptops and an iPad from his £1.5million home in North London. Mr Peston, 52, said: ‘It’s an incredibly distressing time, especially so soon after losing Sian. It’s not about the monetary value, it’s about the sentimental value.

Heartbreak: BBC Business Editor Robert Peston tweeted about the raid at the Muswell Hill home he shared with his late wife Sian earlier today . ‘The rings are irreplaceable  and they . mean a lot to me. They belonged to my grandmother and I gave them to . Sian when we were married. ‘They were from the 1920s and were Art Deco in style. As well as the . wedding ring and engagement ring there was also a gold ring, inscribed . with the words ‘‘my darling’’. ‘Also taken was a gold necklace which said ‘‘mum’’ with a heart on it. One of our sons had given it to Sian as a present. All I can do now is . hope they are returned to me.’ Mr Peston’s Edwardian end of terrace house was broken into while he was out at work. He revealed the burglary on Twitter, saying: ‘Burgled last night. My . beloved late wife’s 1920s engagement & wedding rings taken. Naive to . think they might turn up, but . . .’ Police said he may have been targeted because of his high-profile role . which may have helped criminals learn his movements. He is best known . for his coverage of the credit crunch. They added that Mr Peston had told them the laptops may have contained . sensitive material relating to his work but declined to discuss what it . was. Treasured: A picture of one of the rings, released by Mr Peston today . A second house in the upmarket area, which has views of Alexandra Palace . and is popular with families, was also targeted on the same evening. However police were not prepared to say the burglaries were linked ‘at . this time’. Mr Peston took a short leave of absence after his wife died three months . ago. The couple met when they were teenagers as Miss Busby was a school . friend of Mr Peston’s younger sister, Juliet. They began dating when they were studying at different universities, . although it was only a brief affair and ended when the former Financial . Times and Sunday Telegraph reporter took a posting in Brussels. They . rekindled their relationship  in the mid-1990s after her first marriage . ended. Three years ago Miss Busby revealed that they were brought back together . after Mr Peston’s sister was seriously injured in a road accident and . suffered memory loss. Robert Peston worked as a journalist on the Financial Times and Sunday Telegraph before he joined the BBC . She said: ‘I started going to see her with photographs to talk about our . school days and help her piece her memory back together. ‘Robert was often there at the same time, but I was feeling so low that I . didn’t think he – so handsome, so successful – could possibly be . interested in me.’ However the couple married in 1998.

A pensioner kidnapped at gunpoint was released just ten minutes later after telling her attacker he was the “most hopeless criminal” she had ever met. The retired nurse - known only as Janice, 64, - was snatched from her home by a robber dressed bizarrely in swimming goggles and a high-vis jacket. He forced her into the passenger seat of her Peugeot 207 and took her on an erratic drive around her home town of Lymington, New Forest, Hants. Crime scene: The pensioner known only as Janice was kidnapped from her home in Lymington in the New Forest . The crazed intruder demanded money and threatened to shoot his terrified victim during the ten minute trip, she revealed today. But he later apologised, saying he was a desperately poor father who needed money - and even sobbed about his failed business. Janice today revealed he fled in her car with just £100 after she put a comforting arm around him and persuaded him to drop her back home. The motor was discovered a short while later abandoned nearby. The kidnapper snatched his victim at random from the driveway of her home as she was on the way to the hairdressers. She said: 'It didn’t take me long to realise he had a gun against my head. I told him: ""Look, I don’t have time for this - I’ve got a busy day with lots to do"". I was so angry.' The gunman marched her inside and ordered Janice and her husband, 70, to sit next to each other. Janice continued: 'He said he didn’t want to do what he was doing, that he had a wife and small baby daughter. I began talking to him. 'I asked him how he got into this - telling him he clearly wasn’t a criminal - and then at one point I even got up and put my arm around him. 'I told him I felt so sorry for him adding: ""You’ve got yourself into a terrible situation"".' The attack was the second to happen in the New Forest in just nine days . Janice described how she and her husband argued over who should be the hostage while the gunman stood waving his arms around. She added: 'I said to him: ""This is totally rubbish - you call yourself a criminal? You are the worst criminal I have ever encountered"". He just took it.' The gunman then threatened to shoot Janice but she told him: '“What’s the point in murdering me? An armed robbery is bad enough"".’ 'Back on the driveway, I asked him: ""So who is going to drive then?"" and he said ""Me"". 'I got into the passenger seat and he got in next to me, wearing his goggles again. 'He spun out of the driveway while I ordered him to put his seatbelt on because the warning alarm was sounding. 'I was telling him to take the goggles off, that he looked silly.' With no clear plan of what he should do next, Janice began laying in to him again - criticising the mistakes he had made and demanding he stop the car. She said: 'He admitted it was a complete failure and I told him I agreed - that it had gone too far and it had to stop.' Heeding her advice, the daft gunman drove Janice home but told her he would have to stop and collect his bag because he had left it at her home. Janice said: 'He’s not a psychopath - he’s a desperate man. I told him: ""Just go away. I don’t want to see you again"". Then I wished him a Happy Christmas and off he went in my car.' The kidnapping on December 14 was the second armed robbery in the New Forest in nine days. The driver of a Porsche 911 Carrera was kidnapped at gunpoint from Brockenhurst Railway Station and forced to withdraw cash on December 5. A gunman also raided a post office eight miles away in Highcliffe, Dorset, on Tuesday. Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Murray, from Hampshire Constabulary, said: 'We believe this man lives locally. 'He is someone whose life has fallen down around him and is facing exceptionally hard times. He has told his victims he lost his business and he has a wife and kids.' Two men, aged 48 and 44, have been arrested in connection with the offences and released on bail.A third man, 44, remains in police custody.","Janice, 64, was snatched from her home Lymington, New Forest, Hants, by a male armed robber .

He kissed his wife goodbye with the words ‘see you tonight’ before leaving for work at the usual time. But health manager Neil Bryson, 50, never made it to the office and vanished without trace. Almost four weeks later Mr Bryson’s disappearance remains a complete mystery. An apparently happily-married father-of-two, he had a good job, with no financial problems and no history of depression. His . wife Janice, 49, and sons Jack, 20, and Harry, 24, have been left . heartbroken and are clinging on to the hope he suddenly returns for . Christmas. Mrs Bryson said: ‘Everyone is absolutely devastated by this, it is so out of character. ‘There . will be no Christmas this year at our house. We will have his mum over . on Christmas Day and just try and have a normal day and try and support . her. ‘I just want him home, I . just want him to know it is OK to come home. Whatever has happened it . can be sorted out, I just need to get him home, the boys need him home.’ In a direct plea to her husband, she added: ‘Neil, I just want you to know how much I love you and want you home.’ Mrs Bryson said she knows of no reason why her husband would leave home or take his own life. The couple, who have been married for 27 years, live in the picturesque village of Scholes, near Holmfirth, West Yorkshire. Mr Bryson left home at 6.30am on November 27 and his car was found abandoned the following afternoon at Yateholme Reservoir – one of his favourite walking spots. Missing: Neil Bryson, 50, vanished from his home in Scholes, North Yorks, almost four weeks ago. There was no clue that anything was wrong . Police mounted a full-scale search involving the force helicopter, sniffer dogs, divers and 20 members of the local mountain rescue team. Mr Bryson worked as head of operations for older people’s mental health services at the Bradford District Care Trust. He had no apparent worries in his role and his wife said he had a happy home life. She said they had celebrated her birthday the weekend before he went missing by going shopping and eating out. Caring: Mr Bryson with wife Janice, who says his disappearance is a complete mystery . They were planning to book their annual holiday to the Canary Islands in the New Year and Mr Bryson was due to move to a new job in the same line of work. The evening before he went missing, Mr Bryson laughed as he looked through holiday snaps with his family. Mr Bryson is 6ft tall and slim. When he was last seen he was wearing a dark suit with shirt and tie and a dark brown Barbour coat. Nicola Less, of Bradford NHS Care Trust, said: ‘His disappearance is of great concern to all who know and work with him. ‘We are doing everything possible to assist the police in their efforts to locate him and we are in regular contact with his family.’","Janice Bryson, 49, pleads for missing husband Neil to return to family home in Scholes, West Yorks .

It also said it would pay for the . restoration of a Stalin monument in Gori, the Georgian city most . affected by the 2008 war that saw Moscow recognise the two breakaway . regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states. Zemo Alvani resident Phatima . Patishvili, said: 'I . came here because I love Stalin and I love my people. I remember when I . was 12 how my grandmother was weeping when Stalin died.' In Moscow, hundreds of Russian . Communists led by their leader Gennady Zuyganov laid flowers at Stalin's . grave at the Red Square on Friday, while smaller rallies were held across . Russia and several former Soviet republics. Stalin critics  also made their mark on the anniversary. In southern Ukraine, several ethnic Crimean Tatars trashed a small street exhibition on Stalin.

Critics of the Stalin regime hold him responsible for the.he deaths of at least 724,000 people during the purges and repression of the 1930s, while millions died as a result of the forced labor system in Gulags, the Soviet prison system.

We are often told that every snowflake is different - but the naked eye is simply not advanced enough to appreciate the world's favourite form of precipitation. But even without a white Christmas this year, we are able to fully explore the complexity of the water molecules that make up snowflakes thanks to an American scientist and his fascination with the white stuff. Kenneth Libbrecht, a Professor of Physics at the California Institute of Technology, has been studying snowflakes, ice patterns, crystal growth and ice formations since 1997. Using a specially designed photo-microscope called the SnowMaster 9000, the 53-year-old braves subzero temperatures to catch falling snow flakes, photographing them before they melt. Placing the snowflake underneath the microscope, he illuminates the snowflake with coloured lights. Unique: Professor Kenneth Libbrecht collects snowflakes in Northern Ontario, Alaska, Vermont, the Michigan Upper Peninsula and the Sierra Nevada mountains . Fascination: Kenneth Libbrecht, Professor of Physics at the California Institute of Technology, has been studying snowflakes, ice patterns, crystal growth and ice formations since 1997 . Sophisticated: The scientist photographs the flakes using a device called the SnowMaster 9000, a cross between a microscope and a camera . These pictures show real snow . crystals that fell to earth in Northern Ontario, Alaska, Vermont, the . Michigan Upper Peninsula and the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. The . professor was first inspired to capture snowflakes after realising that . they had never been captured in a way that intrigued him. He . said: 'When I first began toying with the idea of writing a book about . snowflakes, I found that there weren't any really nice pictures out . there. 'The state-of-the-art in snowflake photography was not what it could have been. 'This . was an opportunity, so I set out to design and build a photo-microscope . that was optimised for taking pictures of snowflakes.' Mr Libbrecht soon found that he would have to overcome a number of challenges to acquire the images he desired. 'There . are a number of challenges in photographing snowflakes. The crystals . are small, so the usual techniques of macro photography don't work well; . what you need is essentially a high-quality, low-power microscope. Equipment: The Snowmaster 9000, built by Mr Libbrecht, features a microscope and a Nikon D1X camera within a heated enclosure . 'In . addition, the equipment must be robust enough to work outside, and it . has to withstand sub-freezing temperatures. Finally, to take good . pictures, you have to take a lot of pictures. Therefore, I wanted my . hardware to be easy to set up and use.' Snow . flakes form when a cloud droplet first freezes into a tiny particle of . ice. As water vapour starts condensing on its surface, the ice particle . quickly develops facets, which form into different shaped snowflakes . depending on temperature. Whilst scientists differ on the classifications of snowflakes, the scientist has identified 35 different types of formations. These . include Stellar Dentrites, plate-like snow crystals that have branches . and sidebranches, which are typically 2-4 mm in diameter. Stellar . Plates or 'common snowflakes' are thin, plate-like crystals with six . broad arms that form a star-like shape, forming when the temperature is . near -2 C (28 F) or near -15 C (5 F). Others like Fernlike Stellar Dentrites are the largest snow crystals, often falling to earth with diameters of 5mm or more. Building . the specially designed SnowMaster 9000, a microscope and Nikon D1X . digital camera contained in a heated enclosure, Mr Libbrecht was able to . get the desired results. Dedication: After studying snowflakes for 14 years the scientist has identified 35 different types of snowflake formation . Colour: To . highlight the snowflake's dimensions and qualities, Mr Libbrecht uses . illumination techniques from a variety of colour filters for different . effects . 'The . camera itself is housed in a heated enclosure, white styrofoam box, so . that it can stay outside in the cold indefinitely,' he explains. 'The snowflake is placed on a platform attached to a translation stage for focusing. 'As . is typical for microscopes, it is more convenient to move the subject . than to move the lens. I attached a flexible shaft and a large knob to . the stage, making it easier to focus with cold fingers.' To . highlight the snowflake's dimensions and qualities, Mr Libbrecht uses . illumination techniques from a variety of colour filters for different . effects. 'Snow crystals are . made of ice, which is clear and colourless. I like to illuminate the . crystals with coloured lights from behind, using the optical layout . shown above. 'The snow . crystal then acts like a complex lens that refracts the different . colours in different directions, producing a variety of colourful . effects. 'To illuminate . the crystals, I use a lamp mounted below them. Above the lamp is a . heat-rejection filter and a piece of ground glass and on top of those . components I can place any of a number of colour filters. The field lens . focuses the colour filter onto the microscope objective.' Kenneth's . amazing images have allowed him to further his study of of crystal . formations and apply them to a number of industries - particularly . manufacturing. Precision: He has to take lots of photographs before finding one that works effectively . Further use: As well as providing beautiful images, the scientist says his work helps understand the 'structure formation and 'self-assembly' qualities in snowflakes . Unique: Speaking of each snowflake's distinction, he said: 'There is no . blueprint or genetic code that guides the growth of a snowflake' 'There are . several good reasons for studying how snowflakes form. First of all, . crystals are useful in all sorts of applications, and we would like to . know how to grow them better. By studying the physics of snowflakes, we . learn about how molecules condense to form crystals. 'Another . good reason to study snowflakes is to better understand structure . formation and self-assembly. The snowflake is an very simple example of . self-assembly. 'There is no . blueprint or genetic code that guides the growth of a snowflake, yet . marvellously complex structures appear, quite literally out of thin air. 'As . we understand better how snowflakes form, we learn about self-assembly. As the electronics industry pushes toward ever smaller devices, it is . likely that self-assembly will play an increasingly important role in . manufacturing.' But the scientist says that his study of snowflakes is the pursuit of understanding basic science. 'My . personal motivation is not from potential practical applications. I am . not trying to make better artificial snow, better ice for Olympic . skating, bigger diamonds, faster computers, or anything like that,' he . said. 'I want to figure . out the underlying physics of snowflake growth because this is an . interesting puzzle in molecular dynamics. I would like to understand the . fundamental physics of how molecules jostle into place to form a . crystal. 'How fast does . this happen? How does it change with temperature? What happens if there . are chemical impurities on the ice surface? These remarkable structures . simply fall from the sky - we ought to understand how they are formed.'","Professor Kenneth Libbrecht studied snowflakes, ice patterns, crystal growth and ice formations since 1997 .

A man is looking forward to the ‘best present ever’ when he spends time with his father on Christmas Day for the first time. Westley Grey, 50, had never met his father, Westley Snr, until October this year when he travelled to the United States. Along with his twin, David, Mr Grey, of Greenock, Renfrewshire, started searching for his father after the death of his mother Thomasina. Westley Grey, 50, had never met his father, Westley Snr, until October this year when he travelled to the United States . Westley Grey's mother Thomasina and his father, Westley Snr Moorehead, who he recently met for the first time ever. It is believed to have been taken just before he was called away to the Caribbean for the Cuban Missile Crisis . They knew he had served in the US Navy and eventually tracked him down to Texas. Mr Moorehead joined the US Navy in 1945 aged 17. During the early 1960s he was stationed at Holy Loch near Dunoon, Argyll, a US nuclear submarine base during the Cold War. While there he met Miss Grey and the couple fell in love, but shortly afterwards Mr Moorehead was sent to the Caribbean during the Cuban missile crisis and later to war in Vietnam. Just after he left, Miss Grey discovered she was pregnant with twins but had no way of contacting Mr Moorehead, who had no idea until David Grey found him in the United States. David Grey travelled alone to Texas to meet his father, now 84, and discovered that he and his brother have three stepsisters and a stepbrother. Westley Grey, who has learning difficulties and lives in supported accommodation operated by Quarriers, held a series of fundraisers and together with money given to him by the charity, eventually raised enough for him and two of his support workers to join his twin on a flight to meet Mr Moorehead, who now lives in Tennessee. Their October flight was delayed due to Hurricane Sandy, but the wait was worth it. Westley Grey said: ‘It’s been the best year of my life and now I can’t wait to see my dad for the first time in my life on Christmas Day when I Skype him. That’s the best Christmas present I could ever want. ‘It was the most amazing moment in my life to finally meet my dad for the first time.

Speaking from his home, he said: ‘I felt blessed to have met Westley and David for the first time in my life. ‘It was incredibly emotional – I will never forget the moment I first saw Westley. ‘Now I’m very much looking forward to speaking to him for the first time on Christmas Day. ‘The past few months have been a rollercoaster of emotions – meeting Westley and then losing my wife. ‘I’m extremely glad, though, that they managed to meet before Bernadine died. He will have good memories of a wonderful woman.’ Westley Grey has been supported by Quarriers for 25 years. The charity’s chief executive, Paul Moore, said: ‘This is one of the most heart-warming stories in the 140-year history of the charity. ‘Westley is really well known and liked both within the charity and the wider community – everyone was so thrilled when we heard he had met his dad for the first time. ‘We were delighted to have played a part in helping make the trip of a lifetime happen – it was the very least we could do for Westley.’","Westley Grey, 50, had never met his father, Westley Snr, until October .

Tearful tributes were paid yesterday to a 14-year-old Scottish schoolboy who died in scorching heat on a trek in the Australian outback. Ewan Williamson collapsed in temperatures of 118f (48c) in the Cape Range National Park during the walk with his father Gordon, 49, on Friday. Mr Williamson called the emergency services but the teenager, from Largs, Ayrshire, could not be revived. He had travelled to Western Australia a week earlier to spend Christmas with his father, who now lives there. Friends of the popular schoolboy were devastated to learn of his death. Largs shop owner Julie Harris, 36, said Ewan was well known in the town for his distinctive blond hair. She added: ‘It’s incredibly sad. My daughter Amy was one of Ewan’s best friends and she hasn’t stopped crying. 'She is devastated. Ewan was such a nice boy. 'He was very quiet but everyone liked him.’ Her 14-year-old daughter wrote a heartfelt tribute, which said: ‘Goodbye Ewan. I wish I didn’t have to say goodbye to you. ‘You were kind, funny, and most of all an amazing friend. I will never forget how I hugged you goodbye on Friday and thought I would see you in January. ‘I’ll never forget you. You will be in my heart forever.’ Ewan, who is thought to have suffered from asthma, had set out with his father at around 10am on Friday to walk along the Badjirrajirra Creek. Police said the pair were found down a 2,300ft gully at around 2pm. St John Ambulance officers treated the boy at the scene, but his condition deteriorated and he was taken to Exmouth Hospital, where he died in the early evening. Extreme: Temperatures in the Badjirrajirra Creek area can hit 122f . Ewan had moved to a flat in Largs with his mother, clothes shop worker Janet Butler, three years ago after his parents’ marriage ended. The Largs Academy pupil had celebrated an early Christmas with her before jetting off to stay with his father, who lives in Geraldton, about 260 miles north of Perth, Western Australia. Devoted mother: Janet Butler, whose son has died in the Australian outback while hiking . A 65-year-old neighbour in Largs, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘Ewan’s mum and her partner were doing up his room for when he got back. 'I only saw him a couple of weeks ago. It’s terrible to think something so awful has happened. ‘We used to see him coming home from school. 'He was always polite, just a nice boy.’ It is understood that Ewan’s mother has now flown to Australia to collect her son’s body. The teenager’s 72-year-old grandfather, Louis Williamson, who lives in Rothesay, Argyll, said Ewan and his father had been planning to follow their trek with a camping trip. He added: ‘Ewan was overcome with dehydration. As far as I know, he took convulsions and collapsed. 'My son managed to contact the emergency services and they flew him to hospital but they couldn’t save him. ‘He was a loving boy, very family-orientated. We are going to miss him terribly.’ Conditions in the Cape Range park can be extreme, with temperatures of up to 122f (50c) in the summer months between November and March. Police said the cause of death and the circumstances surrounding the tragedy are still to be determined. A report will now be prepared for the Western Australia State Coroner.","Ewan Williamson collapsed in Western Australia while out hiking with his father .

A reading consultant at Sandy Hook Elementary School has recounted how the principal and school psychologist saved her life by confronting the gunman after he broke into the building. Becky Virgalla was in a meeting with  Principal Dawn Hochsprung, school . psychologist Mary Sherlach and other colleagues when the shooter opened fire on Friday December 14. Mrs Hochsprung, Mrs Sherlach and lead teacher Natalie Hammond 'went out in the hall to check out the noise that we didn't know that was gunshots at first,' Mrs Virgalla said. Scroll down for video . Saved: Speaking at a memorial for Sandy Hook victims, Becky Virgalla recounted hearing the gunshots ring out. Three members of staff ran out of the room and warned her: 'Shooter, stay put' 'The three of them were shot and they . yelled back, ""shooter, stay put"",' she told Reuters. 'And they saved my life and the life of . four others who were at that meeting.' The gunman shot dead 20 children and six female staff members at the school in Newtown, Connecticut, making it in the second-worst mass shooting in U.S. history. Before attacking the school with a . military-style assault rifle, the gunman shot and killed his mother at their . home. He took his own life at the school. Among the victims were Mrs Hochsprung, 47, and Mrs Sherlach, 56, while Ms Hammond survived the attack. Heroic: Principal Dawn Hochsprung, left, and school psychologist Mary Sherlach, right, were killed . Speaking at a memorial where the names of the victims were written on wooden angels, Mrs Virgalla, a married mother of two, said parents and teachers need to check their doors lock from the inside. 'Ours did not and teachers had to go out,' she said. 'You can't be out in a hall when a shooter is present in your school. Just that simple thing could make a difference in time and safety of the children.' Since their deaths, the community has paid tribute to the courage of the principal and psychologist. Mrs Hochsprung's daughter, Erica Lafferty, told the Today show last week that she was finding it 'tough' after learning her mother died when charging at the gunman. 'I had a really hard time not being mad about it but that's who she was,' Lafferty said. 'She faced every single problem that she ever had in her life head on. Spared: Virgalla, pictured with her husband, was in a staff meeting when fire rang out on December 14 . Warning: She said that all teachers need to make sure there are locks on the insides of doors at schools . 'My cousin referred to her as a 'bull' yesterday. There's no stopping Dawn when she has a mission. She gets it done and she gives it everything she has.' She went on: 'To say she was a wonderful person is the understatement of the century. She put her life into making everyone else's lives so much better. Her smile lit up every building she walked into. 'She made an impact on everyone that she's ever come across. Every adult, every child - especially the kids. [They were] the light of her life.' As well as the women, other stories of heroism have emerged since the massacre. Special needs teacher Anne Marie Murphy was found cradling the body of six-year-old Dylan Hockley, whom she died trying to save, while Vicki Soto died shielding her students from bullets.

If there were ever any doubts that showing off is in Pudsey the dancing dog’s blood, this family picture should dispel them. The Britain’s Got Talent star has been enjoying some well-deserved time off with his brothers Hero, Toggle and Kez, and sisters Piper and Becky. The litter of six were all back together for the first time since puppyhood at a party to celebrate Christmas and their forthcoming seventh birthday which is on Friday. Star quality: Britain's Got Talent star Pudsey was joined by his siblings, from left, Kez, Piper, Pudsey, Hero, Toggle and Becky . Reunited: The litter of six were together for the first time since puppyhood and also celebrated their forthcoming birthday on December 28 . Most of them were happy to pose in festive headgear – with one notable exception. Becky’s owner Teresa McAteer had to use all her powers of persuasion – and some out-and-out bribery – to get her pet in the line-up. The problem was that Becky’s Santa hat was too big and kept falling over her eyes. Finally a smaller substitute was found, along with a few tasty doggy treats, and Becky completed the sextet. Pudsey, who has been performing with his owner Ashleigh Butler in the Dick Whittington pantomime at Woking, Surrey, took a break from his hectic schedule to spend some time with his very different siblings, who came from all over the country to see him at his digs in Guildford. Ashleigh, 17, said: ‘Pudsey doesn’t really get time to spend with other dogs so it is nice for him to have fun with his brothers and sisters. Say cheese: Owners Ashley, Yvonne, Janette and Margaret call the dogs to look forward for the picture at the reunion . Reluctant diva: Becky's owner Teresa tried a variety of Santa hats on her pet - who remained distinctly unimpressed by the whole affair . They see each other at dog shows but this is the first time we’ve been able to get them all in one place at the same time since they were born.’ As with most family reunions, sibling rivalry inevitably came into play with the animals trying to outdo each other with their dancing tricks. ‘They do normally get on, but I think they’re just quite excited,’ Ashleigh explained. Pudsey and Ashleigh shot to fame after becoming the first dog act to win Britain’s Got Talent in May. Now a household name, Pudsey has performed in front of the Queen as a part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations and even has his own book – Pudsey: My Autobidography.

Growing up in a family of impoverished garbage pickers on a ghetto on the outskirts of Manila, Jessa Balote knows that to make ends meet, you have to keep on your toes. Now the slim teenager has followed that rule to the letter - and left her life of grime and poverty to become a leading ballerina who performs in glistening opera houses across the world. Miss Balote grew up on the Aroma ghetto, on the outskirts of the Filipino capital, before she was discovered at the age of ten by a ballet school - and prepared for a life on stage. Prima ballerina: Filipino slum dweller Jessa Balote, centrr, practices during a class at Ballet Manila in the Philippine capital after becoming a scholar at Ballet Manila's dance program . In four years since her audition in 2008, Jessa has performed in productions including Swan Lake, Pinocchio, Don Quixote and a local version of Cinderella. She rode a plane for the first time in August to compete in the 2012 Asian Grand Prix ballet competition for students and young dancers in Hong Kong, where she was a finalist. The 14-year-old Jessa’s unlikely success is as much a celebration of a unique effort by the Philippines’ most famous prima ballerina, Lisa Macuja, to help slum kids of Manila by providing them a scholarship and classical ballet training for six to seven years. From slum dweller to ballet scholar: Jessa Balote makes around 7,000 pesos ($170) a month, or sometimes double that amount, from stipend and performance fees . Cramped conditions: Jessa Balote grew up on the Aroma slum, Manila, pictured above left, selling rubbish with her father. She still lives in the tiny home where her ballet certificates are proudly displayed, above right . Shanty town: Aroma in Tondo, Manila, Philippines, pictured above, is home to families who collect and sell rubbish to try to make ends meet. They are among 94 million people who live in abject poverty there . More than a quarter of the Southeast Asian nation’s 94 million people live in abject poverty, many in sprawling and unsanitary shanty towns like Aroma in the capital city. Despite a recent economic upturn, there are not enough full-time jobs. Education skills are lacking and incomes are low. At least 3,000 Filipinos leave their families behind every day to seek employment abroad. Jessa, who would have likely followed her family to a life of garbage picking, had not much of a future to look forward to. Talented: Slum-dweller Jessa Balote auditioned for the ballet scholarship at the age of ten and is now one of the country's brightest young stars . 'I used to tag along with my father and mother when they collected garbage in the evening,' Jessa said in her home about the size of a shipping container with a small attic. Her family would gather trash from houses in the nearby Quiapo district or rummage for scrap metal in the huge garbage dump not far from home. That was until her successful audition for the Project Ballet Futures dance scholarship established by Macuja, founder and artistic director of Ballet Manila who is married to business tycoon Fred Elizalde. The outreach program of Ballet Manila — which runs a dance company and a school by the same name — initially accepted 40 students from Jessa’s charity-run school in Manila’s Tondo district dump site. Some dropped out, but new batches have been accepted. Today, the program has 55 scholars, aged 9 to 18, from five partner public schools such as Jessa’s. They train daily after school along with 60 paying students. 'I can help my parents more with what I do now. I earn money from ballet,' said Jessa, sitting on a plastic bench in her shorts and t-shirt, her long hair loose. The teenager, so used to dancing, would often have her toes pointed at the wooden floor even while sitting during the interview. Behind her, the plywood wall of the family shack was adorned with pictures of her in a gossamer tutu on stage. Sharing the space were frames of ballet certificates and a newspaper clipping about the garbage picker-turned-ballerina. A pair of satin pointe shoes lay on top of a gym bag, a few meters (yards) from sacks of used plastic bottles and other garbage piled up outside the door of her cramped home. Jessa and other children are trained in the rigorous Russian Vaganova ballet and are required to keep up with their academics in school. Fighting poverty: Ballet Manila has 55 scholars, aged 9 to 18, from five partner public schools such as Jessa's, pictured above. They train daily after school along with 60 paying students . They are provided a monthly stipend of 1,200 pesos to 3,000 pesos ($30 to $73) depending on their ballet level, as well as meals, milk and ballet outfits. They also receive fees of 400 pesos to 1,500 pesos ($10 to $37) for each performance. Pointe shoes alone cost $50 to $80 a pair — a fortune for someone eking a living on $2 a day — and wear out within weeks or days, said Macuja. The daughter of a former senior trade official, Macuja was 18 years old when she received a two-year scholarship at the Vaganova Choreographic Institute (now the Academy of Russian Ballet) in Saint Petersburg in 1982, where she graduated with honors. She was the first foreign principal ballerina for the Kirov Ballet in St. Petersburg before returning to the Philippines, where she worked as artist-in-residence at the Cultural Center of the Philippines and a principal dancer at the Philippine Ballet Theatre. Spotting stars: Project Ballet Futures dance scholarship aims to help children such as Jessa but its routines are still punishing, pictured above . Macuja, 48, founded Ballet Manila in 1994 with the aim of making the high art of classical ballet more accessible to common people. The dance company has held performances in malls, schools, town halls and remote villages of the archipelago. She set up the scholarship program in 2008 as a way of paying back for her good fortunes. For Jessa and the other slum children, it opened a whole new world. Literally so, when she flew to Hong Kong for the ballet competition. Her glee while on a roller coaster in Disneyland was captured in a photo in her humble home. During the competition in Hong Kong, she said she often felt nervous and shy to be dancing among well-off peers. But she overcame her fear, remembering Macuja’s advice 'to persist despite the odds and to not let poverty hinder me.' As a company apprentice she makes around 7,000 pesos ($170) a month, sometimes more, from stipend and performance fees. The money is not enough to lift her family from poverty, but ballet has given her a choice in life. Her father, Gorgonio, works part-time as a construction worker besides collecting garbage.

The two Australian DJs whose hoax phone call has been blamed for the death of a nurse at a hospital which treated Kate Middleton for morning sickness are unlikely to face any charges. Police in Sydney have revealed that no request has been received from Scotland Yard detectives to interview radio presenters Mel Greig and Michael Christian. The 2Day FM radio hosts duped Jacintha Saldanha and another nurse at the King Edward VII Hospital in London into  revealing private medical details about the . condition of the Duchess of Cambridge. Radio presenters Mel Greig, left, and Michael Christian are unlikely to face charges following their royal hoax call, police have said . Just days after Ms Saldanha transferred the call, she was found hanged. It was originally thought the two hosts could face prosecution but yesterday Sydney police said no request had been made by detectives in the UK suggesting no further action would be taken. New South Wales Deputy Police Commissioner Nick Kaldas said yesterday: 'Nor do we expect there to be any requests.' Mr Kaldas said Scotland Yard had not asked for any further information or to interview the two Sydney-based hosts. Duped: Nurse Saldanha was found hanged just days after the hoax call . 'There was some initial contact after the death of Jacintha Saldanha but not a lot since and because of the passage of time we believe it is unlikely any charges will be laid,' he said. Since her death, it has been revealed Ms Saldanha had attempted to kill herself twice in the past year and had been prescribed anti-depressants. Officers submitted a file to the CPS last week for it to consider whether any offences may have been committed by making the hoax call. But senior police in Australia believe British prosecutors would have difficulty in finding a charge that could be laid against the two DJs. Ms Saldanha's suicide made world headlines three days after the call was aired on 2Day FM. The nurse had taken a phone call from Greig and Christian pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles, inquiring about the Duchess of Cambridge's health. Ms Saldanha transferred the call to another nurse who gave the DJs an update on the Duchess's condition. Since the nurse's death, the pair have been subjected to hate mail and death threats forcing them to go into hiding. Apart from a TV interview in the days after the suicide, the two have not been seen in public. They made a tearful apology and their radio station has pledged at least $500,000 - about £320,000 - to help the dead nurse's family. A London inquest heard earlier this month that Ms Saldanha had been found in staff accommodation and there were no suspicious circumstances over her death. Ms Saldanha left three notes, in one of which she criticised the DJs.","Scotland Yard has not asked to interview two Sydney-based 2Day FM hosts .

Margaret Thatcher's 'ideological mentor' urged her to run a campaign of fear to deter teenage girls from becoming pregnant, according to newly published files. Education Secretary Sir Keith Joseph wanted the Government to produce a series of 'scare' films in an attempt to curb the number of pregnancies among immature adolescents from 'the least good homes'. Joseph - one of Mrs Thatchers closest Cabinet allies - believed a 'sharply rising trend' of bad parenting was a 'major cause of poor education and crime', and he had no doubt who was responsible, according to official papers released by the National Archives under the 30-year rule. Allies: Mrs Thatcher (left) was told by her then Education secretary Sir Keith Joseph (right) that the government should produce a series of 'scare' films in an attempt to curb the number of teenage pregnancies . 'The young concerned tend to be the least mature from the least good homes. They embark on parenthood casually,' he wrote in a memorandum to Thatcher, dated October 1982. 'Those girls who are at most risk will tend neither to restrain themselves nor insist on or use contraceptives nor to have sufficient grip even to consider abortion in sufficient time.'His solution, he acknowledged, would be controversial. 'The young concerned tend to be the least mature from the least good homes', Thatcher was told in 1982 . 'One possibility - delicate and fraught with risk - would be to try to use, in connection with pregnancy, the approach used in connection with cigarette smoking - that is fear,' he said. Joseph - sometimes dubbed the Mad Monk - reminded Thatcher that when he was a minister at the Department of Health and Social Security he approved a series of four short films to try to scare people off smoking. 'They were widely noticed. Some of the most vulnerable may have been influenced because the films used hedonistic and short time-horizon arguments. 'We could therefore explore whether short scare-films, suggesting that maternity is marvellous when the parents concerned are ready for it, might be practicable.' His comments echo a controversial speech he made eight years earlier when he claimed that single mothers 'who were first pregnant in adolescence in social classes 4 and 5' were threatening the balance of 'our human stock'. His words, in 1974, raised the spectre of eugenics and were widely seen has having cost him the chance of the Tory leadership. Instead he urged Thatcher to stand.","Details discovered in official papers released by the National Archives .

The declining fortunes of child actors as they move into adulthood has become a sadly familiar story in Hollywood. But the tragic life of one, Manuel Benitez, who died in a shoot-out with police in a Californian restaurant in 2008 - after allegedly killing his girlfriend and kidnapping his own son - was so unusual it has been made into a hard-hitting TV documentary. At the peak of his acting career in the 1980s Benitez, whose screen name was 'Mark Everett,' seemed to have it all, starring in popular films including 'Stand and Deliver' and 'Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.' But when his Hollywood career came to an end his life began a downward spiral. Scroll down for video: . Prodigy: The life of Manuel Benitez (pictured right as an adult) went down hill after his career as a successful child actor - under the name 'Mark Everett' (pictured left) - came to an end . The story of Benitez's fall from grace has been profiled as part of the Final Cut series which is broadcast by the Investigation Discovery television network. During the 1990s, Benitez - who was reportedly the illegitimate son of a bullfighter - started a relationship with a woman called Stephanie Spears and the couple had a son together. He was arrested on drug charges in 2000 and convicted for possession of a concealed and illegal loaded firearm in 2003, and was sentenced to probation. Girlfriend: Stephanie Spears was allegedly bludgeoned to death by Benitez before he went on the run . His relationship with Ms Spears had also apparently begun to deteriorate. He allegedly bludgeoned her to death . with a dumbbell in front of their son at their home in California in . 2004, after trying to leave with the child while Ms Spears was asleep. The FBI offered a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to Benitez's arrest and he featured on America's Most Wanted several times - but he remained at large. He was finally cornered at a restaurant in El Monte California on December 23, 2008. Police arrived at the eatery after receiving a call about a suspicious man with a child. A hostage standoff then ensued with Benitez barricading himself inside the restaurant's bathroom with his son. He is reported to have told police that he was going to shoot them and harm the boy. A worker at a nearby Mexican restaurant said Benitez had his son in a headlock and had been holding a gun to his head. Streets surrounding the restaurant were closed off by the police as dozens of emergency personnel gathered at the scene. After throwing a flash grenade inside the restaurant police engaged Benitez in a gunfight in which he was killed. His son was shot in the thigh but survived.

The new iphone... which runs on Android: Brazilian company Gradiente have tried to cash in on the Apple gadget's cult status with this cheekily named smartphone . Still, considering the legal crusade Apple launched against Samsung for allegedly copying its designs for the Galaxy range of smartphones, it is likely that the lawyers are sharpening their swords. But, name aside, the new phone by São Paulo-based consumer electronics firm Gradiente is no iPhone clone. It doesn't come anywhere the specs of Apple's flagship gadget, nor does it look much like it's namesake. Dubbed the Gradiente iphone Neo One, using a 700MHz processor it splashes Android 2.3 Gingerbread onto a rather paltry 3.7in capacitive touchscreen display. Head to head: Name aside, there are few similarities between the iphone and Apple's genuine article, right . The dual-sim phone comes complete with two cameras, front and back, with 0.3 and 5 megapixels resolution respectively, but no flash - although if you live in sun-soaked Brazil you might not need it. Of course, iPhone users feeling a sting of jealousy towards their Android-wielding peers can always download Gmail, Chrome, Field Trip, YouTube Capture, Google Search, and now Google Maps, to get pretty much the same experience. Perhaps the only good thing about the new iphone is the price. It retails 599 Brazilian Real - about £180 - and can be bought on an interest-free ten instalment plan. As far as MailOnline knows, there is no plan to market the phone outside of Brazil.","São Paulo-based firm marketing phone with a subtly different name .

Samsung is set to show off a 5.5in flexible 720p display at next month's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, according to reports. That Samsung is choosing to present the hotly anticipated technology at the world's premier electronics trade show strongly suggests it will be included on the company's next generation of smartphones out next year. However the company will not just be presenting a tiny, phone-sized bendy screen at the event, but will also bring along a mammoth 55in version more suited for a television or monitor. Scroll down for video . Bendy: Samsung is gearing up to produce the next generation of mobile phone screens that can be bent and twisted by early next year, according to reports . The screens work through the use of . organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), which are thin and can be put on . flexible material such as plastic or metal foil. They are a major advance on regular . LED displays, which are usually made on a glass surface and are thus . prone to cracking and smashing. CNET reports that Samsung will show . attendees at the January CES a 5.5in flexible screen with a 1,280x720 HD . resolution intended for smartphone use, as well as the bigger version. Flexible displays are made by depositing organic light emitting diodes on a flexible plastic surface. Regular . LED displays are usually made on a glass surface, but substituting that . for a flexible plastic such as polyethylene terephthalate makes it . possible to manufacture screens that are both flexible and lightweight. One possible mass-production method might use a technique similar to inkjet printing. Officials from the South Korean firm's . screen-making spin-off Samsung Display told the website the new screens . are able to curve without breaking, but they aren't yet ready to be . rolled up or folded.

'Looking to the first half of 2013, we . see evidence of Samsung likely accelerating the release of the Galaxy S .

Bendy: The breakthrough has been made by through the use of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), which are thin and can be put on flexible material such as plastic or metal foil . Durable: Although being bendy is their most exciting characteristic, simply using plastic to manufacture the screens rather than glass could help make phone screens less likely to crack . Samsung is a frontrunner in developing . the unbreakable screens, as OLED panels can replace glass substrate . with plastic material. Down the road, mobile gadgets could be flexible as well as unbreakable. 'Eventually, they'll have unbreakable and flexible displays,' said Mark Newman, an analyst at Stanford Bernstein in Hong Kong .

Superstorm Sandy hit the New Jersey shore town of Mantoloking hard - 60 homes were demolished when waves crashed over the sand dunes and swept into the small community. The water washed away the road leading to Ed Wright's house and pummeled ten of his neighbors homes in a 200-foot radius. But Mr Wright's house endured. It was the only house in his immediate neighborhood left standing by the ferocious storm and it sustained only minor damage. Devastated: Ed Wright's house, center, was surrounded on all sides by water after Superstorm Sandy breached the protective sand dunes in his community . Stranding alone: Mr Wright's house was built atop dozens of pine pylons that were sunk deep into the sand . The New Jersey Star-Ledger calls Mr Wright's house 'the Mantoloking Miracle' - but closer examination reveals that the house remains standing because Mr Wright took special care when building it and used design features meant to withstand a hurricane. Now, FEMA and the town of Mantoloking are studying the home and could make some elements of its construction mandatory for all new houses that are built in the beach community. 'The goal is to construct things that will stay around awhile,' Mr Wright told the Star-Ledger, 'and hopefully outlive you.' Unlike his neighbors, Mr Wright elevated his home and built it on top of 34 treated pine pylons that were driven 20 feet into the sand. The first inhabited floor is eight feet above the beach. And the walls in the ground floor, used as a garage and for storage, were made to collapse easily under the force of waves - saving the rest of the home. Home sweet home: Ed Wright looks around at the re-construction efforts from his house, which was largely undamaged by the storm . Planning ahead: Mr Wright took this 1968 photo of flooding where he later built his house. He knew high water would come again and tried to prepare for it . Even the roof is designed with a hurricane in mind - long and sloping it faces north to 'shoulder the prevailing win,' the Star-Ledger reports. When the storm came, the home did exactly what is was supposed to. The walls on the ground floor gave way and allowed the water to wash around the pilings - leaving the living spaces of the house mostly untouched. While his neighbors homes were swept off their foundations or blasted to splinters by the water from the storm, which hit the New Jersey coast on October 29. Most of Mr Wright's neighbors had only a small crawlspace beneath their houses, which provided no protection against the force of water. High water: A police boat patrols the water around Mr Wrights surviving house . While his neighbors lost everything, Inside Mr Wright's house it barely looked as though a storm had ever hit. The refrigerator was ruined by water and a few floorboards were damp. Houseplants had been toppled over and a few pictures were knocked off the wall. Otherwise - the living space was untouched.

Slacklining is done with a specially-designed rope known as a slackline and is considered to be more challenging than a conventional tightrope as the line is not completely taut, therefore susceptible to bouncing and stretching. Mr Rogers said: ‘Ancient Art is the most popular tower to climb and the rock in this area is essentially petrified mud with only the stronger layers of the hillside remaining after years of erosion. Death defying duo: Mario Richard flies his parachute close to Mr Lewis on his slackline . Post-plunge: After jumping off the highest tower, 800 ft high, Mr Lewis and Mr Richard open their parachutes in preparation to land . ‘It's about 250ft tall and has an iconic summit perched above the crumbling rock below. The diameter is about 2ft allowing for only the boldest of climbers to stand on top. ‘We can also create a “spaceline” here - which is essentially a slackline rigged between three separate points that all meet in the middle. ‘It allows three people to be walking simultaneously. ‘The line is about 400ft high and you can see how comfortable the guys were.’ Outstanding outline: Mr Lewis and Ms Ashburn balance on a 35 ft long slackline while Richard Webb flies his base canopy around the summit . Mr Rogers, who has been slacklining for 10 years and BASE jumping for four years, got his first taste of slacklining when he saw one at a climbing competition he was competing in. He was so amazed by the slackline that he forgot to compete and just slacklined all day. BASE jumping followed after skydiving for a year, thanks to a friend who inspired him by showing him all the beautiful places he had jumped. Mr Rogers said: ‘Spending time here is just unbelievable. Everyone is great friends and you never know who you might bump into. ‘On Echo and Cottontail we did a few BASE flybys from a jump higher up with BASE jumper extraordinaire Mario Richard. ‘Andy took to the highline while Mario flew extra close under his BASE canopy. ‘Mario got within 3-4ft of him before zooming on through the rest of the towers. ‘I don't think there is anywhere else in the world you could have that much fun.’ Spectacular scenery: Mr Lewis is dwarfed by the huge tower he has climbed .","Moab Desert is a spectacular location for climbing, skydiving, base jumping and slacklining .

Putin's signing of the bill has angered Americans and Russians who argue it victimises children . President Vladimir Putin has signed a bill banning Americans from adopting Russian children, less than 24 hours after his office received it from Parliament. The bill has angered Americans and Russians who argue it victimises children to make a political point, cutting off a route out of frequently dismal orphanages for thousands of children. The measure is retaliation for an . American law that calls for sanctions against Russian officials deemed . human rights violators, after Russia imprisoned lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who later died, after uncovering a £143million fraud. The signing comes hours after a Moscow court acquitted the only official charged with his death. The Russian-language hashtag 'PutinEatsKids' was trending on Twitter just minutes after Putin signed it. Unicef estimates that there are about 740,000 children not in parental custody in Russia while about 18,000 Russians are on the waiting list to adopt a child. The law also blocks dozens of Russian children now being adopted by American families from leaving the country. The US is the biggest destination for adopted Russian children - more than 60,000 of them have been taken in by Americans over the past two decades. The . U.S. State Department says it regrets the Russian Parliament's decision . to pass the bill, saying it would prevent many children from growing up . in families. Amnesty International Europe and . Central Asia director John Dalhuisen said: 'This bill is frankly a . childish response to the Magnitsky Act. 'The Duma should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen Russian civil society, not weaken it.' Putin said the U.S. Act had 'poisoned relations' between the two countries . Children's rights ombudsman Pavel Astakhov says that 46 children who were about to be adopted in the US would remain in Russia if the bill comes into effect. Mr Putin has said that US authorities routinely let Americans suspected of violence toward Russian adoptees go unpunished. The passage of the bill followed weeks of a hysterical media campaign on Kremlin-controlled television that lambasts American adoptive parents and adoption agencies that allegedly bribe their way into getting Russian children. A few MPs claimed that some Russian children were adopted by Americans only to be used for organ transplants and become sex toys or cannon fodder for the US Army. A spokesman with Russia's dominant Orthodox Church said that the children adopted by foreigners and raised outside the church will not 'enter God's kingdom.'

'It is these thoughtless acts and deliberate jokes that can cost lives as that single action can have an impact on the swiftness of the police's response to a real emergency. 'I would urge everyone to think carefully before dialling so that our call handlers can focus their efforts on real emergencies as they happen. You wouldn't want your own call being delayed by a hoax so why have someone else's?'

He had his conviction overturned on Friday after spending the last 19 years in prison, but Juan Rivera could face another appeal by state prosecutors before he is released. The 39-year-old was jailed in 1992 for the rape and murder of an 11-year-old girl but a court in Illinois has declared he ‘suffered the nightmare of wrongful incarceration’. Mr Rivera was told the news by fellow inmates on Saturday but now a pending appeal by state prosecutors could jeopardise his freedom. Holly Staker was raped and murdered in Waukegan in 1992 and Mr Rivera was interrogated by police for four days before confessing to the crime. A lack of physical evidence linking him to the crime scene and DNA testing in 2005, which proved his semen was not the sperm found in Holly’s body, were critical factors in the appeal. The court also found that the police’s lengthy interrogation of Mr Rivera, who was originally in custody for burglary, could have influenced his confession. ‘The details the defendant provided were the result of psychological suggestion or linguistic manipulation’, the court ruled. Mr Rivera is said to have been banging his head against the wall and pulling his hair out during police questioning 19 years ago, The Times reported. Victim: Holly Staker, 11, was raped and murdered in 1992 in Waukegan, Illinois . During his trial, jurors were convinced that Mr Rivera knew details of the crime scene that only the murderer would know, but this argument was rejected after the court ruled ‘the evidence supports an inference that details of the crime were provided to the defendant, intentionally or unintentionally during the investigative process.’ Prosecutors are not able to bring Mr Rivera to trial again but they could ask the court to look over the findings again and launch another appeal to block his release. After learning of the ruling, Mr Rivera told the New York Times by phone: ‘It was overwhelming, it’s still a shocker at this point. ‘This is all I know, 19 years, this type of environment. It’s strange to say, but I’m going to miss all my friends.’ The Lake County state’s attorney, Michael J. Waller, told the newspaper: ‘We are going to study the opinion, confer with our appellate attorneys on Monday and determine a course of action.’","Juan Rivera was jailed in 1992 for the rape and murder of Holly Staker .

But in fact they depict a bizarre annual tradition in a Spanish village which sees revellers taking control of the community and fighting a mock battle to impose their surreal regime. Citizens of Ibi, in the province of Alicante, took to the streets today with flour, eggs and firecrackers in what must surely be one of the biggest food fights in the world. Fight: Two revellers taking part in the 'Els Enfarinats' festival in Ibi in south-east Spain .

The origins of the tradition are unclear - it is said to be over two centuries old, but in its current form it has been running only since 1981. The festival of 'Els Enfarinats' is held every year on December 28, the Day of the Innocents which is similar to April Fool's Day in Spanish culture. It consists of two main groups who clash outside the town hall and cover the area in messy substances such as eggs and flour.

One group is the 'Els Enfarinats', married men who assert control of the town and impose absurd laws on the citizens, fining anyone who disobeys them. In opposition is 'La Oposicio', a group which represents the forces of law and order and attempts to defeat the new regime. Emerging from the mist: The flurries of flour look almost like smoke curling across a battlefield . Going with a bang: The streets are filled with dangerous firecrackers as well as the food . No mercy: Participants clearly take the tradition, claimed to be over 200 years old, very seriously indeed . Throughout the course of the day, the town became increasingly chaotic as food and fireworks flew through the air and coated the streets.

A couple are looking forward to an extra special Christmas this year, after their daughter's miraculous recovery from a stroke at the tender age of three. Doctors feared Mabel Munoz could have permanent brain damage after she had the rare brain bleed while out shopping with her father Harry. Thankfully the prompt actions of the emergency services meant Mabel made a full recovery and she is now looking forward to a festive family celebration. Mabel, 4, and her mother Tracy are looking forward to an extra special Christmas after Mabel survived a stroke and heart surgery . Mother Tracy Hill from Teignmouth, Devon, said: 'We just feel so thankful. Every time I cuddle her I think ""What would I have done without her?"" 'We keep saying all the time that it's going to be a good Christmas this year. It could have been so different. 'If we hadn't got her to the hospital so quickly in the air ambulance she might have been left brain damaged and sitting in a wheelchair this Christmas.' A stroke is a sudden disruption to the blood supply of the brain. They are rare in childhood, affecting just 300 children in the UK every year. Around half of those who suffer a stroke, like Mabel, will have an underlying medical condition. But the other half will have been apparently healthy beforehand. Strokes can affect many things including a child’s movement, speech, behaviour and learning. However, in the majority of cases these effects are mild. No two children recover in exactly the same way after a stroke. Progress will depend on the area of the brain affected, and what caused the stroke in the first place. Treatment includes medication such as blood thinners and physiotherapy. Mabel's ordeal began when she started vomiting while in town with her father Harry. Mr Munoz took his daughter home to bed thinking she had food poisoning, but her condition quickly worsened. Mrs Munoz said: 'He brought her home and then she went . limp and her eyes kept rolling back and he phoned an ambulance. 'I had . been at work and when I got home she was lying at the bottom of the . stairs. My first thought was that she had fallen down the stairs. 'The ambulancemen knew straight away. When she got to Torbay Hospital they did an MRI scan and sent it to Frenchay in Bristol.  They said ""We want her here now"". 'When I heard she was going in a . helicopter I knew how serious it was.' Harry and Tracy had to travel by . car because an anaesthetist had to accompany Mabel in the helicopter, . keeping her in an induced coma. 'We didn't know if she would be dead or alive when we got to Frenchay so it was really scary,' Mrs Hill said. 'The transfer time was critical. With . strokes from the point of collapsing you only get about three hours to . eradicate the bleed and stop it spreading.' The family then had a long anxious wait for Mabel to come around from the coma. Until she awoke . doctors could not say if the bleed on the right hand side of her brain . would have left her permanently disabled. Mrs Munoz said: 'I sat by her side and didn't know if she would recognise me or would be able to speak. 'She opened her eyes and looked at me . and said 'I'm hungry'. They brought her some toast and she was only . using her right hand side, but I knew she was still my Mabel when she . said 'That's yummy yum pots'.' Fighting fit: Luckily Mabel did not suffer any permanent disability after having a stroke . The youngster had to re-learn how to walk but within a week she ran out of the hospital. Mabel, who has since had her fourth birthday, was later found to have a narrow main aorta to the heart, causing high blood pressure. She has since undergone a heart operation and had a stent fitted to widen the artery. Now she has to wear a special boot at . night to keep her left foot straight and will need more heart surgery . when she outgrows the stent in a few years time. She is happily attending pre-school in nearby Shaldon where big sister Bella is a pupil. Mrs Munoz said: 'We were very, very lucky thanks to . the fantastic care we had from so many people. I just wish I could . line them all up and thank them.' Helena Holt, the boss of Devon Air . Ambulance Trust, said: 'We are all delighted to learn that Mabel has . made such a fantastic recovery.

The 29-year-old man, who has not been named, managed to raise a smile while being treated by paramedics, despite suffering serious injuries, including another partially severed finger, a crushed knuckle and a deep gash in his leg. Scroll down for video . Close shave: The surfer, who has not yet been named, is treated after losing a finger and suffering a bite to his thigh in a shark attack . The surfer had been sitting on his board waiting for a wave when . the shark struck, biting into his right thigh. ‘He tried to push it off with his left hand and his hand has gone into . its mouth,’ said Senior Police Constable Chris Rowley after the surfer . had been taken to hospital in Port Macquarie, north of Sydney. ‘He’s lost the index finger past the knuckle, and another finger was just hanging by shreds I don’t know if it can be re-attached.’ Constable Rowley said the man’s thigh had suffered a ‘slash bite’ rather than losing any flesh and paramedics were confident the wound could be easily stitched up. The man was able to paddle in by himself on his board with a friend at his side, when they were able to raise the alarm. He was later flown to hospital in Newcastle, 100 miles north of Sydney. The experienced surfer told police and paramedics that he was reasonably sure he had been attacked by a bull shark measuring about 8ft long. Danger: The surfer believes he was attacked by a bull shark (like the one pictured) but the exact species has yet to be confirmed . ‘He’s been able to keep a tooth from the attack and give it to the right people,’ said Constable Rowley. ‘I don’t know where he found it – maybe in his board, which was damaged – and put in in his pocket when he got to the beach.’ Experts from the Department of Primary Industries will examine the tooth to confirm the species of shark involved in the attack. The surfer had been staying at a camping site with his wife, who flew with him to hospital. Kylie’s Beach, at Diamond head, south of Port Macquarie, where the attack occurred, is popular with surfers due to its exposed location and protection from north-easterly winds. Beaches in the area have been closed as a precaution. Local people said it was extremely rare for a shark attack to occur in the area. There have been 50 fatalities from shark encounters in Australian waters in the past 50 years, 30 per cent of attacks proving fatal.

A Moscow court has acquitted the only official charged with the death of whistleblowing lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. Magnitsky, who exposed a £143m fraud, died in jail in 2009 after his pancreatitis went untreated. An investigation by Russia’s presidential council on human rights concluded that Magnitsky was severely beaten and denied medical treatment. The Tverskoy court found jail doctor Dmitry Kratov not guilty of negligence causing death. Magnitsky’s family and associates described the trial as sham, saying authorities failed to prosecute officials responsible. Financier Bill Browder poses beside a picture of his former lawyer Sergei Magnitsky . The case has become a rallying point . for human rights advocates in Russia and abroad. Congress in December . passed legislation calling for sanctions against officials deemed human . rights violators. The Magnitsky Act provoked . retaliation from Moscow, including a bill barring Americans from . adopting Russian children that President Vladimir Putin is expected to . sign. Russian politicians accused America of . Cold War tactics for passing the law barring any of its officials . suspected of human rights abuses from the US. Magnitsky was arrested in 2008 while investigating a £143m fraud by Russian tax and police officials. He was hired to investigate the fraud by financier Bill Browder, who has since campaigned for justice him. The new bill will see Russian officials accused of human rights abuses banned from getting visas, and also aims to freeze the assets of those involved in Mr Magnitsky's death. But Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov condemned it and claimed his country would retaliate by barring US officials accused of the same abuses. Speaking after a meeting with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Dublin, he said: 'We will also close entry to Americans who are guilty of human rights violations.' The government department he oversees also attacked the bill on Twitter, saying it was from the 'theatre of the absurd' and would 'adversely affect the prospects of bilateral co-operation.' US Secretary of State has incurred the wrath of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov over the bill . The tweets continued: 'Apparently, Washington has forgotten what year this is and still thinks the cold war is going on. 'It is perplexing and preposterous to hear human rights complaints from the US, where torture and kidnapping are legal in the 21st century. 'This biased approach is nothing but a vindictive desire to counter Russia in world affairs.' Angry Kremlin officials also coralled the Young Guard youth wing of the ruling United Russia party to protest. It's spokesman Maxim Rudnev said:'The US positions itself as a country of freedom. 'And yet, the American leadership is itself infringing upon the freedom of citizens of another country. 'It's worth asking: is the United States deserving of hosting the Statue of Liberty?'

The father of a 13-year-old Florida girl who was shot dead by a student on the school bus in November has killed himself after spending five weeks grieving for his daughter. Lourdes 'Jina' Guzman-DeJesus was shot to death on November 20 in Miami, Florida in front of her younger sister and seven other children when another student on the school bus took a gun out of his backpack and accidentally shot her in the neck. The girl's father, Armando 'Alex' Guzman, 34, did not have a close relationship with the girl but was said to have been overcome with grief and guilt at the tragedy. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and his body was discovered on Thursday in a vehicle in Broward County. Family sorrow: Lourdes 'Jina' Guzman-DeJesus, left, was killed in November and her father, Armando 'Alex' Guzman, right, committed suicide five weeks after the 13-year-old's death . Victim: Thirteen-year-old Lourdes was tragically shot to death in front of her younger sister and seven other children while riding a school bus . Fatal wound: The teen was killed when another student took a gun out of his backpack and accidentally shot her in the neck . The girl did not have regular contact with her father, who had been in prison for a while, according to the Miami Herald. Sources said that Guzman had not provided financial support for his daughter, who was raised by her mother, Ady DeJesus. But family members said that the father was overcome with grief at the loss of his daughter. 'It had to be that whole thing of guilt that really got to him,' family member, David Font, who is DeJesus' cousin said. 'I heard that he had been very depressed.' No other victims: Eight other children, including Guzman's 7-year-old sister, were on the bus but were not harmed. Guzman is pictured far left . The student who shot her is . 15-year-old Jordyn Howe, whom police took into custody immediately following the incident. Police . believe that the gun went off accidentally while Howe was showing the . gun to other students on the bus. Guzman was flown to Miami Children's Hospital after she was injured, where she later died. She was a student at . the Palm Glades Preparatory Academy charter school. Eight other children, including the victim's 7-year-old sister, were on the bus but were not harmed. Authorities took the children and the bus driver to a police station to be interviewed. The shooting happened near the intersection of Southwest 296 Street and 137 Avenue, around 6:45 a.m. 'Officers responded and that's when they discovered that there was a 13-year-old girl suffering from a gunshot wound,' said Miami-Dade Police Detective Alvaro Zabaleta. Aftermath: A 13-year-old girl was shot to death while riding a charter school bus with her younger sister on Nov. 20 . The belongings of the eight children on-board the bus at the time of the shooting lie outside the school bus . 'They were immediately able to determine that the subject or the shots came within the bus and he was able to be detained and taken into custody.' Concerned parents gathered at the scene, which was cordoned off by crime scene tape as authorities combed the bus for evidence and gathered children's backpacks and belongings. 'Thank God, none of the other children, approximately eight of them, they were not hurt,' said Zabaleta. Students from Palm Glades Preparatory Academy, a charter middle school south of Miami talk amongst themselves after the shooting . Zabaleta reassured parents of the schools involved that no further incidents were expected. 'We made contact with all of the schools, everything is fine and none of them have been placed on shut down, so everything is OK, no need for panic,' he said. Grief counselors have spent the morning at charter school, said Lynn Norman-Teck, a spokeswoman for Florida Consortium of Public Charter Schools. The school principal also walked through every classroom after the incident to make sure the students were safe. A phone message left for the private school bus company was not immediately returned.","13-year-old girl was shot to death while riding a charter school bus with her younger sister in November .

Anti-virus software tycoon John McAfee took a romantic stroll with a mystery woman in Miami over the weekend. Wearing a pinky ring and chatting on the phone, McAfee seemed relaxed, despite the fact he remains wanted for questioning over a death in Belize and faces a $5million lawsuit in Arizona. The 67-year-old claimed last week that he has no money or a home in the U.S. and that he was going to stay in Florida until his 20-year-old Belizean girlfriend could join him.

He attended to some business on his cell phone before sitting down to a romantic meal with the woman. The software mogul usually updates his personal blog with pithy comments and tales of his international escapades on a regular basis.

'Hello readers, I apologize for my recent absence and lack of updates,' he wrote.

A potentially expensive court case over the death of Robert Gilson, 61, was a major factor for the renegade setting up his eccentric life in Belize in 2007. Gilson died in a small aircraft in Arizona a year earlier. Gilson's family blame McAfee for the horrific crash of the married father-of-three who was taking lessons in 'aerotrekking' - a sport that McAfee invented and involves flying a trike at speeds of 75mph. The wrongful death lawsuit alleges that McAfee hired his 22-year-old nephew, Joel Bitow, as flight instructor even though he didn't possess the right qualifications. Bitow then took Gilson to one of the most dangerous parts of a canyon in Arizona where they suddenly lost control and went into a spiral dive to their deaths. After the crash, McAfee sold his 280-acre Woodland Park, in Colorado, a Hawaiian beachfront home and a string of other properties and set up in Belize - he and his money safe outside any U.S. court jurisdiction.

"By . Associated Press and Matt Blake . PUBLISHED: . 11:59 EST, 27 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:53 EST, 27 December 2012 . The daughter of jailed former Ukrainian premier Yulia Tymoshenko has urged Western nations to impose sanctions on officials involved in her mother's imprisonment. Tymoshenko, the country's top opposition leader, is serving a seven-year prison sentence on charges of abuse of office after a trial that was condemned by the West as politically motivated and which strained Ukraine's ties to Europe and the United States. Tymoshenko denies the charges and accuses President Viktor Yanukovych, her longtime foe, of orchestrating the trial to bar her from politics. Sanctions: Eugenia Tymoshenko, left, said judges who jailed her mother, Yulia, right, for seven years should be punished with sanctions, claiming the former premier's trial was politically motivated . With Tymoshenko in jail, Ukraine's fragmented opposition forces were unable to muster a majority in parliament following an election in October, and Yanukovych's allies again control the legislature and the government. But in an interview on Thursday, Tymoshenko's daughter Eugenia, 32, said prosecutors and judges involved in her mother's case should face Western sanctions such as travel bans and freezes on bank accounts. The trial: Former Ukrainian Prime Minister and opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko speaks at her trial as her daughter Eugenia holds her hand at the City districts court in Kiev, Ukraine in October 2011 . Brought down: Supporters of Yulia Tymoshenko carry her during a huge rally in Indepedence Square in Kiev in 2005. But she was later jailed accused of abusing her office . Plot claims: Tymoshenko denies the charges and accuses President Viktor Yanukovych (pictured), her longtime foe, of orchestrating the trial to bar her from politics . 'We understand that we cannot do it . by ourselves inside Ukraine and that is why we need great international . support, but also (an) understanding of our international friends that . Yanukovych will not just voluntarily give up his power,' Eugenia . Tymoshenko said in her mother's office in central Kiev. With her trademark blonde plaits and fiery rhetoric, Yulia Tymoshenko became the glamorous heroine of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution – before being jailed by the man she ousted. Mrs Tymoshenko became Prime Minister after the 2004 revolution to rapturous public acclaim. It seemed Ukraine was finally set to throw off the shackles of its Soviet past and embrace democracy. Today, however, the defiant 52-year-old – who refers to her distinctive plaits as her ‘chain armour’ that ‘protects me from threats’ – has become a symbol of the repression of freedom. Suffering from a back condition, she languishes in a shared room in a prison hospital in the city of Kharkiv (pictured above), where she is serving seven years for abusing her prime ministerial power. Despite the fact that she cannot walk unaided, she is under constant armed guard with video and audio surveillance – testimony that she is still considered a major threat as a figurehead for Ukraine’s opposition. Her conviction has been criticised by the European Union as politically motivated persecution and also condemned by the Danish Helsinki Committee for Human Rights. Meanwhile, she faces further charges of tax evasion relating to her time as head of a private energy company in the Nineties and prosecutors say they have enough evidence to indict her for involvement in the murder of former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Scherban in 1996. Her lawyers argue that the authorities want her to remain in jail for the rest of her life. 'People like judges, like prosecutors . ... they have to be put forward for sanctions. Those are the main . executors of repression. 'Of course, there are people behind them who are in the ruling party, but it could be the first step.' The European Union suspended a key cooperation deal with Kiev over the Yulia Tymoshenko case. Separately, Deputy Prosecutor General Renat Kuzmin, who is in charge of the ex-premier's prosecution, recently had his long-term U.S. visa revoked. The U.S. Embassy in Kiev would not comment on the move, citing its privacy policy. But the visa cancellation followed efforts by Kuzmin to question U.S.-based witnesses in a nearly 15-year-old murder case in Ukraine in which Kuzmin claims Yulia Tymoshenko is implicated. She denies all the accusations. Her daughter also exhorted the . international community to investigate and prosecute alleged instances . of 'international corruption' involving Ukrainian officials in the West. For instance, Yulia . Tymoshenko has petitioned American authorities to investigate how . Ukraine's Justice Ministry commissioned a top U.S. law firm to analyze . her trial for what Ukraine's government says was a mere $12,000 . Tymoshenko's . lawyer Serhiy Vlasenko has said that such a report must have cost well . over $1.5 million and accused Yanukovych's allies of paying for it . illicitly. The report . by the New York-based firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom . claims that there is not sufficient evidence that Tymoshenko was . prosecuted for political reasons, though it finds numerous flaws in her . trial. The law firm has not . commented on its fee for the report, which was dated September but not . made public until earlier this month. Yulia . Tymoshenko has been in prison for about a year and a half, but Eugenia . Tymoshenko expressed hope that Western pressure could eventually free . her mother so that she could run against Yanukovych in the 2015 . presidential election. 'Yanukovych's . main task was to keep my mother in prison for the elections in 2015,' Eugenia Tymoshenko said. 'It (takes) great responsibility and great . power and energy to stop this train that's been going on the reverse . side for Ukraine — away from democratic, European values.'","Yulia Tymoshenko was jailed in 2011 on charges of abuse of office .

After weeks of hiding out in the jungle, investigating an alleged setup, and tossing cell phones to throw off police, who can really blame him for swearing in front of the American public? Eccentric fugitive millionaire software mogul John McAfee, who is on the run from police in Belize for questioning tied to the murder of his neighbour, dropped the f-bomb on live television Friday while explaining his dislike for local politicians. ‘I do not donate to any political party. When I was asked to donate, I said, “Get the f*** off my property,”’ McAfee, 67, said during a telephone interview with CNBC from ‘an undisclosed location.’ He then apologized to the cable network for his verbal slip-up, one of many recent gaffes. Scroll down for video . Anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee at The San Pedro Sun in May of this year for an interview . McAfee was in the midst of recounting an incident earlier this month in which 42 armed Belizean officers allegedly stormed his compound, arrested him and detained him for 14 hours with no food or water, and then let him go without charges. When CNBC reporter, Robert Frank, asked McAfee why he thought the police had done that, he said it was because he ‘does not play by the rules.’ McAfee said that he has donated millions of dollars to the local economy, including police departments and homeless agencies, but not through the Belizean government itself. ‘I don’t do it by giving to the government and letting them dole it out because if I give $5 million to the government, $10,000 goes to the people and $4 million plus change goes into the pockets of the politicians,’ he said. ‘I give directly to the people. And I have been doing this all along.’ On the run: John McAfee, seen here just days before the murder of his neighbor, claims he is being set up by the Belizean government . McAfee, founder of the anti-virus software company that bears his last name, said he has been hiding out in the jungles of Belize and wearing disguises in public when he needs to purchase supplies. He would not say what the disguises look like because he has ‘a feeling’ he will be wearing them again soon, he said. The fugitive software mogul has been on the run from local police since November 11, the day after his American neighbour, Greg Faull, a 52-year-old contractor from Florida, was found shot in the head. Two days before Faull's body was discovered, four of McAfee's dogs were poisoned to death, making McAfee a 'person of interest,' Belize authorities have said. McAfee . says he is innocent and that he will not turn himself in. He has said . on several occasions that he will be killed if he is taken into custody. He has also said the he was set up by the Belizean government and that . it all traces back to a bribe he didn't pay to a politician. But he is certainly not shying away from reporters while hiding out. John McAfee has been a follower of alternative therapies and philosophies all his life and taught yoga after he sold his business . Over the past three weeks he has given multiple media appearances, including two interviews with CNBC, an interview with The Daily Telegraph, an interview with ABC News, and an interview with Wired Magazine. He also set up a blog, where he details his jungle adventures, his ongoing claims of government corruption, his thoughts about the highly addictive drug bath salts, and his own personal investigation into Faull’s murder. A few days after the news of his hiding made headlines, McAfee logged onto the Internet to seek technical support on how phone tracking works, Gizmodo reported. Not surprisingly, skeptics are disputing the validity of McAfee’s claims. The fugitive software mogul told CNBC Friday that he is beginning to run out of money and is having trouble getting cash from his bank in Belize. ‘My life has been up and down from a comfort standpoint,’ he told CNBC.

McAfee said he has no plans to leave the . small Central American country bordered to the north by Mexico, to the south . and west by Guatemala, and to the east by the Caribbean Sea. ‘This is my home,’ he said. McAfee has not been formally charged with murder and is only wanted for questioning, according to Belize National Security Ministry spokesman Raphael Martinez. The country’s prime minister Dean Barrow has called McAfee ‘extremely paranoid, even bonkers.’ Exasperated: San Pedro's Mayor Daniel Guerrero says police want to question McAfee, who is not a suspect . McAfee, who relocated to Belize in 2008 after losing an estimated $96 million due to bad investments, founded his namesake software company in 1987, initially running it out of his home in California. He sold his stake in McAfee Associates in 1994. McAfee was employed as a programmer by NASA's Institute for Space Studies in New York City from 1968 to 1970. He has also worked for Xerox, Computer Sciences Corporation and Lockheed. Update: . McAfee spoke with CNN on camera Saturday, his first on-camera appearance since he went into hiding more than three weeks ago. He told the network he carries up to a dozen disposable cell phones at one time and estimates that he has gone through 200 phones over the past three weeks.

The number of households with four or more cars has soared by 51 per cent to nearly half a million over the past decade. The rising number of women who work is one factor behind the increase. Another is the trend for grown-up children to continue to live with their parents. Families with four or more cars now account for nearly 1 in 50 of all households, an analysis for the Daily Mail of the 2011 census results by the RAC Foundation showed. Scroll down for an interactive map . Rising: The number of households with four or more cars has risen by 51 per cent in the last decade, according to analysis for the Daily Mail by the RAC Foundation (stock image) The organisation said the findings are proof of the ‘relentless rise of the car’ and our dependence on it at a time when families are being priced off trains and seeing cuts to local and rural bus services. The number of households with three cars is up by nearly a third (31.5 per cent), while two-car families have increased by 13 per cent. Overall the number of households with two or more cars is up by nearly a fifth (18 per cent). In contrast the number of homes with no car or just one car has grown by less than 4 per cent. However, a ‘real terms’ assessment showing the number of cars per 1,000 people reveals that the proportion of households with no car has actually fallen by 4.5 per cent. Those with one car has also dropped, according to this measure, by 3.6 per cent. Use the RAC's interactive map to see details of car ownership in your area . Although the areas with the biggest proportion of multi-car households tend to be in the wealthier parts of southern England, those seeing the fastest growth in such homes are in the less well-off or more rural parts of the North and Wales. These are also among the places which have seen the biggest rises in women drivers in recent years. The RAC Foundation compared the 2001 and 2011 censuses and found that some 7.5million households in England and Wales now have two or more cars or vans. That is nearly one in three (32 per cent) of the total, a rise of around 18 per cent on the 6.37million households a decade ago. Increase: Families with four or more cars now account for nearly one in 50 of all households . Over that period the number of two-car households has risen 13.3 per cent to nearly 5.78million. The number of three-car families has risen 31.5 per cent to 1.28million. And the number of households with four or more cars has soared 51.3 per cent to 453,190. Across all of England and Wales, three-quarters (74 per cent) of all households now have at least one car or a van available to them. But this hides big regional differences. Almost all London boroughs have seen a significant decrease in car and van ownership, with Hackney down 24 per cent to 170 cars per 1,000 people. But Shropshire has seen a 55 per cent rise to 604 vehicles per 1,000 people. Nearly 2.6million more women have driving licences today than 15 years ago – almost double the rise in the number of male drivers which is up just 1.4million. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘More women are working than ever before and it is the car that is getting them about.’","Families with four or more cars account for nearly one in 50 of all households .

McAfee bristled as reporters repeatedly asked him why he won't answer questions from officials in Belize, denying he was under investigation. He stressed that he was afraid to answer questions because dozens of officials there stormed his property, killed his dogs, handcuffed him for hours and tried to extort money. He has not been charged with a crime. Broke: While seemingly free to roam South Beach, the man who was once worth $100million says he has nothing left . 'If they didn't want to harm me, why have they been harming my property and my dogs? Now five of my dogs have been killed,' said McAfee, claiming authorities shot one of his dogs in the head and raided his house eight times. He said he had no choice but to flee because 'there was a nationwide manhunt for me' and he worried he would be thrown in a cell and silenced if captured. He claims officials in Belize also trumped up charges against him for running a meth lab out of his home and hiring security guards without a license, he said. 'Did I kill M. Faull? No, let me be clear. I had absolutely nothing to do with the murder in Belize.' He begged the State Department to expedite visas for his girlfriend. Vanegas had accompanied him when he was on the run, but did not go with him to the U.S. McAfee said he faked a heart attack in Guatemala to give his lawyer enough time to file motions keeping him from returning to Belize. 'Immediately after, I got well,' he deadpanned. Speaking to ABC News after landing in Miami, McAfee said admitted that he had 'played the crazy card,' and added: 'It was a deception but who did it hurt? I look pretty healthy, don't I?' He told the network of his relief when told he wasn't going to be detained by American authorities. 'I was met by a dozen or maybe fewer officers. I said, ""Am I arrested?"" They said, ""No, sir, I am here to help you."" That felt the best of all.' But while seemingly free to roam South Beach, the man who was once worth $100million now says that he has nothing left.

He criticized the Belizian authorities for failing to catch him, and thanked reporters for their 'role' in securing his escape. 'Everyone was looking for me, and they did not catch me,' he told ABC. 'I escaped, was captured and they tried to send me back. Now I'm sitting in Miami. There had to be some ineptness. 'What's a better story, millionaire mad man on the run. [The media] saved my ass. Because you paid attention to the story. As long as you are reporting, it is hard to whack somebody that the world is watching.' When McAfee's plane landed at Miami International Airport last night, he was without a travel companion - his 20-year-old girlfriend Samantha Vanegas, who he left in Guatemala. After landing, McAfee, 67, was escorted from the plane by airport security officers, and he quickly checked into a hotel in the exclusive South Beach area. 'Some people felt uncomfortable that he . was on our flight. ... We all knew the story,' said Maria Claridge, 36, a . South Florida photographer who was on the Silicon Valley entrepreneur's . flight to Miami. McAfee, who was seated in the coach section and had a whole row to himself, was wearing a suit and was 'very calm' during the flight, she added. 'He looked very tired, he looked like a man who hadn't slept in days. I'd say he even looked depressed,' said another passenger, Roberto Gilbert, a Guatemalan who lives in Miami. McAfee had been held for a week in Guatemala, where he surfaced after evading police in Belize for nearly a month following the killing of Faull, a fellow American and neighbor on the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye. Police in Belize want to quiz McAfee . as a 'person of interest' in Faull's death, although the technology . guru's lawyers blocked an attempt by Guatemala to send him back there. Authorities there say he is not a prime suspect in the investigation. McAfee has denied any role in Faull's killing. Wealthy: Mr Faull founded the first-ever restaurant to serve alcohol on a college campus at the University of Central Florida in Orlando . Media circus: Surrounded by reporters, McAfee speaks at a press conference in Miami . McAfee led the world's media on a game of online hide-and-seek in Belize and Guatemala since he fled after Faull's death, peppering the Internet with pithy quotes and colorful revelations about his unpredictable life. Residents of the Belizean island of Ambergris Caye, where McAfee has lived for about four years, said McAfee and Faull, 52, had quarreled at times, including over McAfee's unruly dogs. McAfee belives the cops in Belize authorities will kill him if he turns himself in for questioning. He has said he was being persecuted by Belize's ruling party after he refused to pay some $2million in bribes. Belize's prime minister has rejected the allegations, calling McAfee paranoid and 'bonkers.'

Love lost: McAfee's 20-year-old girlfriend Sam Vanegas did not make the trip to the U.S. with him . Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez said the country still wanted to question McAfee about the Faull case. 'He will be just under the goodwill of the United States of America. He is still a person of interest, but a U.S. national has been killed and he has been somewhat implicated in that murder. People want him to answer some questions,"" he said. Martinez noted that Belize's extradition treaty with the United States extended only to suspected criminals, a designation that did not currently apply to McAfee. 'Right now, we don't have enough information to change his status from person of interest to suspect,' he said.","Antivirus software mogul, 67, landed in Miami last night following his deportation from Guatemala .

Australian police have ‘made contact’ with a young motorist who appeared to be driving along a Melbourne motorway with his legs hanging out of the window. Police had pleaded with him to come forward after pictures emerged on the internet. It appeared to show the driver speeding down the Eastern Freeway with his legs protruding from the side window while the vehicle hurtles along in cruise control. The picture was taken by another motorist. A rogue P-plater has been photographed hurtling down a Melbourne freeway with both legs outside the driver's window. He has now come forward to police . ‘I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,’ said the motorist who took the picture, identifying himself only as Stewart. ‘I thought “If his right foot’s outside the window, how is he accelerating?” Then I saw both feet out of the window and I thought “Bloody hell”.’ The driver, he said, was travelling over the speed limit with a number of other people in the car. 'He looked very young,’ said Stewart. ‘This guy’s a risk to my safety. I don’t want to share the road with people like that.’ However, the photograph has now provoked a debate about if they are really the driver’s legs. One man has even put the controversy to the test by getting into his own car in his garage and trying to emulate the driver’s position. His verdict: impossible, unless the driver is a contortionist. The driver appeared to be 'travelling over the speed limit with a number of other people in the car'. But there has been some question over whether it is physically possible for the driver to be in that position . Others joining in the online controversy have turned on the motorist who snapped the picture, saying he appears to have broken the law himself. First, they said, he would have had to have been speeding to keep up with the other car. Then he should not have been using his phone to snap the picture while driving. Police Inspector Bernie Rankin from the Major Collision Investigation Unit said that if they were the man’s legs protruding from the vehicle the incident was no joke. ‘This young man…his behaviour without any further examination is conduct endangering life. That’s a very serious criminal charge,’ he said.","The provisional driver was caught on the Eastern Freeway, Melbourne, appearing to drive with his legs out of the window .

Attorneys for the . suspect in the Colorado movie theater shootings said today that their . client is mentally ill and that they need more time to assess the nature . of his illness. James Holmes' lawyers made . the disclosure at a court hearing in suburban Denver where news media . organizations asked a judge to unseal documents in the case. Holmes, . a 24-year-old former Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado, . Denver, had the same dazed demeanor that he had in previous court . appearances. Dazed: Courtroom sketch shows shooting suspect James Holmes, right, being escorted in for a motions hearing on Thursday in Colorado . Accused: Colorado shooting suspect James Holmes, who was not pictured today, is seen at an earlier hearing for the murder of 12 people in a movie theater . Holmes is accused of going on a . July 20 shooting rampage at a midnight showing of the latest Batman . movie in Aurora, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others. Attorney Daniel King made the revelation about Holmes' illness as he . argued that the defense needs more information from prosecutors and . investigators to assess their client. 'We cannot begin to assess the nature and the depth of Mr. Holmes' mental illness until we receive full disclosure,' he said. King . said Holmes sought out university psychiatrist Lynne Fenton for help. A . hearing was scheduled for August 16 to establish whether there was a . doctor-patient relationship between them. There . were fewer victims and family members in the courtroom Thursday than at . earlier hearings. Several spectators appeared mesmerized by the sight . of Holmes, unable to take their eyes off him. Mental . illness 'doesn't give him the right to do what he did,' Chris Townsond, . who escaped the shooting unharmed, said after the hearing. 'I don't . care how mentally damaged he is.' Debate: The sketch shows Public Defender Daniel King, center, as he talks to Judge William Blair Sylvester, left, at a motions hearing for suspected theater shooter James Holmes . Trauma: Shooting victim Pierce O'Farrill enters court on Thursday to view the hearing of shooting suspect James Holmes . Analysts . expect the case to be dominated by arguments over the defendant's . sanity, and Thursday's statement by the defense was the strongest . confirmation so far that mental illness will be a key issue. A court document previously revealed that Holmes was seeing the psychiatrist for unknown reasons. Holmes' public defenders could argue he is not mentally competent to stand trial. It . was the argument used for Jared Loughner, who pleaded guilty this week . to a 2011 shooting rampage in Arizona that killed six people and wounded . 13 others, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. If . Holmes goes to trial and is convicted, his attorneys can try to stave . off a possible death penalty by arguing he is mentally ill. Prosecutors . will decide whether to seek the death penalty in the coming weeks. Around 20 news organizations also asked Chief . District Judge William Sylvester to scale back a gag order that bars the . university from releasing details about Holmes. Sylvester . had said in issuing the order that he wanted to protect the county's . investigation. But even Aurora officials have cited the gag order in . declining to speak about the city's response to the shootings. News . media attorney Steven D Zansberg said state law allows judges to issue . gag orders barring prosecutors and law enforcement from commenting, but . not agencies outside of the investigation, such as the university. Hearing: Holmes appeared at Arapahoe County Justice Center where his defense team said they needed more time to assess his mental state . King . opposed the news media motion, saying the gag order ensures fairness. Prosecutor Karen Pearson said she had filed her own argument on the . issue in court - and that it is sealed.

Those . documents include the case file, which makes it impossible for . observers to understand prosecution and defense arguments on motions . that are referenced by number only. Those . types of documents can be an important source of information for the . public and can shed light on how police say Holmes prepared for the . shooting and rigged his apartment with explosives. Gregory . Moore, editor of The Denver Post, said before the hearing that the news . organizations are trying to perform their watchdog role, making sure . the investigation is being conducted openly and fairly.

This is the first picture of Pia Balotelli, the new baby daughter of firebrand Manchester City striker Mario. The little girl was born earlier this month to his ex-girlfriend Raffaella Fico, 27, and arrived three weeks early - she had been due on Christmas Day. Balotelli has yet to see his daughter in the flesh and and is said to have only seen pictures of her via email. Bambino: Mario Balotelli's ex Raffaella Fico and their daughter Pia. The Man City player has yet to meet his child . In her first interview since giving birth Raffaella lashed out at the player for failing to act as a proper father. In an interview with glossy Italian weekly Chi, Raffaella posed for several pictures with Pia, as well as her mother and brother Francesco, after securing a five figure deal with the magazine. Chi is the same publication that printed pictures of a topless Duchess of Cambridge in the summer which were taken while she was on holiday in France with Prince William. Furious Raffaella stormed: 'Mario for me is irresponsible. It came to a certain point where he was just not interested in anything, not in me or our daughter. 'Up until certain things happened he was supposed to marry me. That was our project, our desire. 'Then all of a sudden everything collapsed and I don't know why.' Glossy: The picture appeared in Chi, the magazine which featured topless pictures of the Duchess of Windsor . Raffaella and Balotelli were an item for almost a year but split up in March after she flew to Manchester to confront him over a series of alleged affairs - the bust up was so furious that police had to be called to his Cheshire home. Then in June during the European Championships, Raffaella contacted Balotelli to tell him she was pregnant with their child but initially he refused to accept it was his and demanded a DNA test. Devastated Raffaella then hit back and said she had no fear of taking the test and her family rallied round her as it emerged she had also been contacted and urged to have an abortion - something the deeply religious underwear model ruled out completely. Two months ago things appeared to be back on track when Balotelli issued a statement saying he was dropping the DNA requirement and that he would be 'trying again' with Raffaella and the two were pictured kissing on the balcony of home in Naples. But despite his promise it quickly became clear he had no intention of doing the honourable thing as Raffaella confirmed that after he left her in Naples he failed to contact her in the following weeks. Raffaella, who appeared on Italy's version of I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, described he moment she went into labour and rushed to the clinic. 'I sent Mario a text message at 3pm when the first contractions started and then again at 6.30pm when I went into the delivery room. I sent him another as soon as I came out and Pia had been born. 'But he only bothered to get in touch at half past midnight when my phone rang. 'I said to him ""Mario, I've given birth"" and he just said ""Ah OK, I'm not bothered"" and he then put the phone down. I've not heard from him since.' 'Mario's not even bothered about seeing his daughter - even if he doesn't want me to take a DNA test anymore I will do. I will make the results public so everyone knows Pia is Mario Balotelli's daughter.' Scuffles: Balotelli has been in a few confrontations with his Manchester City teammates, including Jerome Boateng (left) and Micah Richards (right) When asked if Balotelli had offered financial help Raffaella said: 'I have not had any economic help from Mr Balotelli. 'He is worth more than da Vinci's Mona Lisa but for his own daughter he hasn't flashed a penny. I have not even had a call asking if I needed anything. I don't need him or his money.' However when asked what she would do if Balotelli did get in touch, Raffaela said: 'The door for his daughter is always open. The door of my heart is closed forever. 'I think when he came back to Naples a couple of months ago to see me that was just a PR exercise. 'Things then were not going well for him on and off the field. 'He doesn't have any paternal instincts. He is not even curious about his own daughter.' Raffaella, whose previous boyfriends have included Cristiano Ronaldo, named her daughter after a mystical monk called Padre Pio who was famous for having bleeding wounds in his hands and feet exactly where Christ had them. During the summer she made a pilgrimage to his shrine near Foggia where she was photographed in prayer in front of his statue with her mother and brother.

The Duke of York’s ex-girlfriend Koo Stark today denied stealing a painting worth £40,000 from a former partner. The 56-year-old, appearing under her real name Kathleen Stark, is accused of snatching the artwork from the flat of her former partner Warren Walker. The actress and artist is accused of stealing the Anthonie van Borssom oil painting, after a housekeeper let Miss Stark into Mr Walker's home in Kensington Park Gardens, London. After arriving with a bunch of flowers, . Miss Stark allegedly demanded a vase before taking another picture off the . wall and getting into a 'tug of war' over it. The housekeeper managed to hold onto . the picture but Miss Stark is said to have run up the staircase and . grabbed the landscape painting of a moonlit castle before fleeing the property. During the court appearance, Miss Stark claimed she was injured by a police officer after being arrested following the alleged offence. American-born Miss Stark dated Prince Andrew after his return from the Falklands in 1982. They met on a blind date during his leave from the Navy and she was later invited to Balmoral to visit the Royal Family. The couple dated for 18 months before splitting after she appeared semi-naked in soft porn film, Emily, with the Duke of York going on to marry Sarah Ferguson in 1986. Accusation: Miss Stark, 56, is accused of stealing a Anthonie van Borssom oil painting from Warren Walker's home in Kensington, London .

Petrol prices in 2012 are 'broadly equivalent' to those during the Suez crisis, House of Commons researchers said . Petrol prices are now as high as in the wake of the Suez crisis when petrol was rationed, shocking new research suggests. In the last 100 years, the cost of filling up a car has only been higher in the wake of the First World War when the petrol pump was still a novelty on the high street. New research by the House of Commons library lays bare how prices at the pumps have soared. Drivers in 2012 now pay as much in real terms as 1957, when the country was gripped by severe shortages after Egypt nationalised the key trading route of the Suez Canal. Using 2011 prices as a baseline, research shows drivers are paying 124.8p a litre in 2012, the highest level since 1957, when petrol cost the equivalent of 132.7p. But House of Commons researchers say the figures are within the margin of error - and  prices today can be ‘seen as broadly equivalent to those during the Suez crisis when petrol was rationed and duty was increased by 40 per cent’. It means fuel costs today are higher in real terms than the sharp spikes seen after the oil shock in 1973, when Arab oil producers imposed an embargo on fuel exports. Petrol is also more expensive in real terms than during the World War Two rationing and the 101.2p cost which triggered fuel protests in 2000. The only time petrol has been higher was when records began in 1920, when motoring was the preserve of the wealthy and petrol cost 159.6p in 2011 prices. Punished at the pumps: Research published by the House of Commons library shows how, in 2011 prices, petrol now costs as much per litre as in the wake of the Suez Crisis in 1957 . Historic high: Petrol prices in Britain are as high now as when British forces were deployed to the Libyan desert to prepare to invade Egypt, after the Suez Canal, a key trade route for fuel, was nationalised . The Suez Canal was a crucial trade route for British ships to reach the rest of the Empire. By 1955, petrol accounted for half of the canal's traffic. In 1936 an Anglo-Egyptian Treaty gave Egypt independence, but British troops would still be based on the canal to protect the strategic interest. In 1951, nationalist leader Nahas Pasha revoked the treaty, and the British garrison soon came under attack. In 1956, President Nasser announced he was to nationalist the Anglo-French Suez Canal Company to raise funds to build a dam. British PM Anthony Eden considered military action to restore Britain's control of the region, but the US balked at the idea. With fuel supplies unable to get through the canal, petrol was rationed from December 1956 to May 1957 and there was a 40 per cent increase in duty. A Commons briefing note said: ‘This . was the first ex-pump price [the price at which the public buy fuel] and it is highly likely that then, as now, . new technology initially comes at a higher price. ‘After . this initial spike, their wider adoption and the greater economies of . large storage tanks will have helped to reduce prices.’ The . lowest real pump prices in recent times were in the late 1980s and . early 1990s when the Treasury cut duty for unleaded and oil prices were . low. Tory MP Robert Halfon, who has campaigned for fairer fuel prices, said: 'Britain is being taken for a very expensive ride. 'Clear evidence has been published by the campaign that I set up - www.PetrolPromise.com - that oil companies and financial speculators are pushing up fuel prices at the pump. 'In my view, Britain should move towards what other forward-looking G8 economies - such as America, Germany, and Austria - have done to crack down on oil cartels. Families are facing an expensive energy-crunch, and we need action to bring prices down.' In his Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne scrapped a planned 3p rise in fuel duty due in January, declaring: ‘That is real help with the cost of living for families as they fill up their cars across the country. And it will help businesses too. ‘It means that under this Government we’ll have had no increase in petrol taxes for nearly two and a half years. In fact they have been cut.’ But the government is under pressure to do more to ease the pressure on motorists. Low and middle income families spend almost 5 per cent of total disposable income on petrol and diesel. The AA motoring organisation found the average cost of filing up a family car with petrol is £1.50 higher than a year ago, and £1.75 higher for diesel. Tory MP Robert Halfon called for a crackdown on 'oil cartels' Luke Bosdet, spokesman for the AA, said: 'In 1957 we were talking about the Suez Cris. 'In 2012 we are talking about the UK family crisis. One was miles away and the other is happening on the streets of Britain.' Ministers are now investigating the impact of the closure of hundreds of petrol stations on prices, with drivers in rural areas forced to travel further to fill up their tanks. In April 2010 there were 8,884 petrol stations open in the UK, but by August 2012 it had fallen by 285 to 8,599. Energy minister John Hayes will publish a report on the retail fuel market in the New Year, which will examine the ‘implications of reductions in the number of petrol filling stations on the security of supply and resilience of the downstream oil sector’. Nick Clegg this month admitted the soaring cost of living was the key concern of voters which the government had to address. The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'They care about how they’re going to pay their bills, the price of petrol, the prices of gas and electricity, the price of food, whether their kids are going to get a job, whether their kids are going to get their foot on the first rung of the property ladder. ‘And those are the things against which we’ll be rightly tested in 2015.’","House of Commons says prices now are equivalent to the fall-out of the 1957 fuel shortages triggered by stand-off with Egypt .

Two men have been jailed for five years after a vigilante knife attack on a drink driver who killed a young boy. Corby Clark, 24, and Andrew Henderson, 44, attacked David Jones in Castlegate, Aberdeen, days after he was released from serving an eight-year jail sentence. The 30-year-old was jailed in 2004 after admitting causing the death of an eight-year-old boy. Andrew Henderson (left) and Corby Clark (right) were jailed for a total of five years after the knife attack . Mr Jones had been drinking fortified wine Mad Dog 20/20 before getting behind the wheel of the car and crashing into a wall on a country road. He left Stephan Henderson - the son of a friend - dying on the ground after he pulled him from the wreckage and fled the scene. Two other boys, aged 11 and 12, were also injured in the crash. Clark and Henderson admitted on Wednesday to attacking Mr Jones two weeks after he was released from jail at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. Fiscal depute Anne MacDonald said: 'The complainer Mr Jones was 30 at the time of this incident. 'He had shortly before this incident been released from prison. That incarceration in prison was with regard to a road traffic incident involving a child. 'The sentence was a sentence of eight years in prison in respect of causing the death by dangerous driving of that child. The pair attacked David Jones (left) after he was released from an eight year prison sentence for killing Stephan Henderson (right) when he drove while drunk on Mad Dog 20/20 . Pictured is the scene of the crash that killed Stephan and injured two others in 2003 . 'This is necessary background to explain something of the reason why this incident occurred on the 23rd of August. The child was the son of Mr Henderson’s partner at that time. 'When the death occurred Mr Henderson, not surprisingly, was upset but unfortunately did not seem to be satisfied by the term of imprisonment imposed by the state and decided to take the law into his own hands which he thought was some sort of revenge.' A judge said that Henderson did not agree with the term of imprisonment and 'took the law into his own hands' The court heard that Mr Jones was released from prison on August 3 and had been out drinking with friends when he was attacked. Ms MacDonald said: 'He felt a few blows then something across the back of his head then ended up on the ground. 'He recognised Mr Henderson straight away and when he was on the ground he felt he was being assaulted. The complainer was on the ground and suffered the attentions of Mr Henderson with the knife.' The court heard Mr Jones was attacked with a Stanley knife and suffered serious cuts to his face and ear. He was taken to hospital where he underwent surgery on his face but will still be left with a 'significant' permanent scar. Yesterday Clark admitted injuring Mr Jones by kicking him repeatedly on the body. And Henderson plead guilty to striking him on the head with a knife to his injury and disfigurement. Defence solicitor John Hardie said the craft knife had belonged to Mr Jones and was taken off him during the attack in the city centre on August 23 this year. He said his client Henderson had spotted Mr Jones in the Castlegate area and had 'wrestled' him to the ground. He said there was significant history between the two men who had known each other before Mr Jones was jailed. The court heard that Mr Jones had been a family friend of Mr Henderson’s then partner, who he split up with after her son’s death. Sheriff Edward Savage described the case as an 'extremely serious offence' and said he was satisfied that a custodial sentence was inevitable. He jailed Clark for 27 months and sentenced Henderson to 36 months in prison. Both men were described as prisoners in court papers.","David Jones killed the son of a friend in 2003 and left the scene of crash .

The US army initially ruled Evans' death a suicide but the crime was reclassified as a murder six months later. And Mr Green now wants to know the full circumstances of his son's death, the New York Daily News has reported. Mr Green, who operates two not-for-profit shelters for homeless veterans in upper Manhattan and Brooklyn, told the Daily News: 'I made my son a promise that I would honour him and fight till I know what happened.'

Police officers carried the boy to a car park where St John Ambulance paramedics, who had also sped to the area, performed CPR. The teenager was then taken to Exmouth Hospital but despite the efforts of doctors he died several hours later. Exmouthshire president Turk Shales said thermometers in town had hit 48C on Friday, and added he was shocked to hear something so devastating had happened near the town so close to Christmas.

Brooks, 35, of Lower Paxton Township is facing a raft of charges after repeated incidents involving elementary school students at a bus stop on her block . A Pennsylvania woman was busted this week after threatening to bludgeon elementary school-aged children to death with a shovel at a school bus stop in the latest unnerving event to shock an already-jittery nation. Simone L. Brooks, 35, of Lower Paxton Township, was reportedly charged with making terroristic threats, stalking, and harassment in connection with several incidents that occurred at a bus stop on her block. Additionally, Brooks reportedly performed a 'simulated strip tease,' before the tykes while perched on her porch in nothing but a bath towel. She reportedly yelled at them during this bit of exhibitionism. Brooks was taken into custody Friday morning outside her home on the 4100 block of Linden Street, authorities told Pennlive.com, and as of Friday was being being held in lieu of $50,000 bond at Dauphin County Prison. The arrest comes exactly a week after the shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 children and six adult teachers and staff were mercilessly massacred by gunman Adam Lanza. Lanza concluded the shooting by taking his own life. The massacre - one of the deadliest school shootings in . U.S. history - shocked Americans, prompting some lawmakers to call for tighter . restrictions on guns and causing school administrators nationwide to . assess safety protocols. Numerous copycat threats have occurred in the Newtown shootings' wake, including a bomb threat at a Newtown Catholic Church last weekend that forced the evacuation of the house of worship during a noon mass. Strip tease: Among her alleged crimes, Brooks performed a 'simulated strip tease' before the youngsters in nothing but a bath towel while perched on her porch. (Stock photo).

Lanza entered the school shortly before 9:30 a.m. dressed entirely in black and carrying two automatic handguns. Shortly after entering the school, he opened fire. He shot the principle, five other adults, and twenty children in just two rooms of the elementary school. Witnesses later described the scene as nightmarish.

The father of a student blinded in one eye in an unprovoked attack by a  teenager yesterday condemned police for letting him go with just a telling-off. The latest shocking example of ‘soft justice’ occurred after Matthew Noblett, 20, intervened to protect a female friend who was being verbally abused by a gang of teens. One lashed out at him, resulting in horrific injuries which caused his right eyeball to deflate. Despite a five-hour operation involving 170 stitches, his sight could not be restored, and he may lose the eyeball altogether. Furious: Matthew Noblett was blinded in his right eye during the attack but the perpetrator was let off with a caution . But because police and doctors were . initially unaware of the severity of Matthew’s injuries, his 16-year-old . attacker was let off with a reprimand – a youth caution which means he . wasn’t even given a criminal record.

That is despite the Lord Chief . Justice, Director of Public Prosecutions and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate . of Constabulary all expressing concern at the number of out-of-court . penalties being issued by police.

Bloodied: Matthew said police initially thought he only suffered cuts and bruises  in the attack . ‘I’ve got no respect for what the . police have done. I got a £60 fine for having the spacing on my private . registration plate wrong. 'Yet this lad has left my son blind in one eye . and gets off scot-free. Where’s the justice in that?

A South Carolina couple are fighting to win back custody of a three-year-old Native American girl they adopted as a baby, after the Supreme Court ruled she should be handed back to her biological father due to 'tribal rights'. Dusten Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation, had never met his daughter before picking her up in his truck in December 2011, and had even told the girl's biological mother that he did not want her. But after finding out the woman, who is not a Native American, had given the girl up for adoption, he invoked the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, which gives American Indian parents preference in custody disputes. Happy family: Matt and Melanie Capobianco with their adopted daughter Veronica, who has been taken out of their custody and given to her biological father as he is Native American . He won custody of the girl and her adoptive parents, Matt and Melanie Capobianco, have not seen her in a year as he has refused to allow them to contact her. Now the Capobiancos are fighting to win back their daughter, Veronica, and in turn, they are battling the controversial federal law that has taken her away. 'No one can believe that this nightmare can happen in America,' Melanie told the Washington Times last month.  'We live in total grief.' The South Carolina Supreme Court had ruled for Brown to have custody even though it called the Capobiancos 'ideal parents who have exhibited the ability to provide a loving family environment.' But the law was put in place to be sensitive to distinctive . aspects of Native American culture and to protect children following . cases of abuse against children from tribes, the New York Times reported. Battle: Veronica, who is now three, was taken by her biological father, Dusten Brown (right), last December and the Capobiancos have not seen her since. He had originally said he wanted nothing to do with her . While family courts usually base their . decisions on the best interests of the child, the 1978 law notes other . factors should be considered and the tribe's interest in the child is . equal to that of the parents. The Capobiancos believe the law has . gone too far, and question whether a man who previously showed no . interest in his child should take custody simply because of he is Native . American. 'There was no transition period, nothing for Veronica,' Melanie said. 'We were ordered to hand her over and that was it. 'We can't understand how she was given . no time to adjust or even meet her birth father in advance of him . taking her back to Oklahoma.' New home: Before Veronica's birth, Brown gave up his parental rights and her mother put her up for adoption . Missed: But on hearing that Veronica, pictured, was up for adoption, the father changed his mind . With the decision causing outrage, Paul Clement, the former U.S Solicitor General, and Thomas . Lowndes, a founding member of the American Academy of Adoption . Attorneys, have filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of the . Capobiancos to restore custody. While the Supreme Court hears only . about one per cent of cases that are submitted, the couple hopes that . the Court will be among those heard in 2013. Brown was given custody of Veronica even though he told his former fiancee, while she was pregnant with the girl, that he wanted nothing to do with the baby - by text message. And in the ruling, one dissenting judge said Brown had 'turned his back on the joys and responsibilities of fatherhood at every turn', while another said his 'vanishing act triggered the adoption in the first instance'. Fight: The Capobiancos have questioned whether it is right for a man - who previously showed no interest in his daughter - take her back simply because he is Native American . The Capobiancos, who live in Charleston, South Carolina, are in touch with the biological mother, who supports their parental rights, but Brown has not allowed them to contact Veronica. 'The concern should not be with a tribe, or a community, a birth parent or an adoptive parent. It should always be with the child,' Melanie said. 'This case is about fundamental justice for children. We are determined not to give up hope.'","Matt and Melanie Capobianco in custody dispute over daughter Veronica .

Gibbs' previous convictions include seven thefts, two offences of dangerous driving, five of driving when disqualified and two of handling stolen goods. James Varley, defending, said: 'He doesn't have any previous convictions for burglary. 'He can't explain the text message and it doesn't reflect the situation or his antecedent history.' Gibbs was several hours late attending court for sentence, because he was saying 'farewell' to his partner and children, aged five months and two years. Mr Varley said: 'It's particularly hard for him going into custody at this time of year.' He was jailed for a total of 18 months and banned from driving for 18 months.","Stuart Gibbs, of Leicester, jailed for 18 months for the attempted burglary .

British troops serving in Afghanistan were given a taste of home when they celebrated Christmas with a traditional turkey dinner, presents from relatives and a charity fun run. An extra effort was made today to make sure the 9,000 servicemen and women deployed in the Helmand Province were given some 'down time' as staff at the Laskah Gah Main Operating Base opened Secret Santa presents along with gifts from family. Medics were given home comforts including new socks, underwear and toiletries as Christmas favourites such as Chris Rea's Driving Home For Christmas and the Pogues' Fairytale Of New York played in the background. Meanwhile, soldiers and service members with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) also enjoyed a Christmas dinner and attended a mass to mark the day.

Amazon and Google have seen their popularity plunge after being accused of avoiding paying millions in tax. An annual list of the country’s favourite brands has seen Amazon slip from first to third, while Google has dropped out of the top ten. The BrandIndex table is calculated by YouGov, which polls a different set of 2,000 people every day about whether they have heard anything good or bad about brands, be it via advertising, the media or word of mouth. The BBC’s iPlayer catch-up service came first in the 2012 rankings, with a score of 30. John Lewis was second with 24.6, and Amazon third with 24.1. BrandIndex director Sarah Murphy said: ‘Amazon had a score of 32.1 last year, so a fall of eight points is a statistically significant drop for them.’ She attributed the fall to ‘the recent tax avoidance debate’. This year a devastating report by MPs attacked Amazon and Google for paying extremely low tax rates by basing themselves abroad. The techniques, branded ‘immoral’ by the public accounts committee, were laid bare in Parliament after executives were called in to explain themselves. Drop: Amazon dropped from first place in 2011 to third place this year in an annual list of the country's favourite brands . Controversy: Online retailer Amazon has been accused of avoiding paying millions of pounds in tax . Amazon admitted basing its European operations in Luxembourg because of the country’s low tax. It paid no UK tax in 2010 on revenues of £3.3billion. Similarly, Google paid only £6million to the Treasury last year on UK sales of £2.6billion. The technology firm, which was accused of avoiding more than £200millon in tax by basing its operations in Ireland, admitted structuring its affairs to minimise its liability. Google finished fourth in last year’s BrandIndex list with a score of 26.7, but this year failed to make the top ten after dropping 15 points. The BBC received two entries in the top ten, despite a difficult year dominated by the Jimmy Savile scandal. In addition to iPlayer taking the top spot, the corporation’s website, bbc.co.uk, came eighth. Controversy: Google finished fourth in last year¿s BrandIndex list with a score of 26.7, but this year failed to make the top ten after dropping 15 points . Denial: Google chairman Eric Schmidt previously said he was 'very proud' of the elaborate structure that helped the search giant slash more than £200million from its UK tax bill last year . The BrandIndex director said: ‘With all the dreadful things that have happened, the BBC brand is still very strong. While the BBC umbrella brand is definitely being hit and is at the lowest levels ever seen, there has been no knock-on effect for products like the iPlayer and its website.’ London Underground received  its first ever positive scores during the Olympics, thanks to the transport network’s unexpectedly smooth performance during the Games. Surprisingly, energy companies recorded big rises, with British Gas and Scottish Power gaining 8.1 and 7.1 points respectively – but this is probably due to their abysmal performances in 2011.","Amazon slips from first place to third over last year in YouGov list .

The woman, who is believed to have suffered head injuries after colliding with a groyne, was recovered from the sea and taken to hospital, where she has today died. She was pulled out of the water after two lifeboats were sent to rescue her, following the attempts of three other people who also jumped into the sea to try and drag her back to shore. A woman has died after she was dragged out to sea while paddling at Hastings Beach on Christmas Day . A police spokesman today said: 'At 10.40am yesterday an adult female was paddling in the sea at Hastings when it appears that she was hit by a wave and taken a short distance out to sea. 'The lady was recovered from the sea and given emergency CPR before being taken to a local hospital. 'Sadly she has died as a result of this incident.' A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman told Mail Online three people had gone into the sea to rescue her before the lifeboats arrived, but had managed to get back out safely. A Dover Coastguard spokesman told the BBC: 'She collided with a groyne, suffered head injuries and was face-down in the water for some time.' The spokesman said the winds were gusting at around 50 knots. The coastguard has said three people jumped into the water at Hastings to try and rescue the woman . Yesterday, the traditional festive swim in Brighton, just over 30 miles away from Hastings and also on the south coast, was called off after the local council closed the beach due to bad weather. Brighton and Hove City Council said conditions would be 'extremely dangerous' for even experienced swimmers, with winds of up to 30mph, a high tide and a heavy sea swell forecast. The council also said the water would be very cold at this time of year, with a temperature of around five degrees.

Turmoil: Gemma Wilkinson weeps as she makes an appeal for information about her missing daughter . The distraught mother of a missing girl kidnapped three years ago wept yesterday as she told of fears she may have been sold on the black market in a child trafficking racket. Former charity worker Gemma Wilkinson, 32, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, has not seen little Atiya Wilkinson since her third birthday in 2009 when she was snatched by her father in a spiteful act of revenge during a planned day trip to the seaside. Former insurance salesman Razwan Ali Anjum, 28, who was livid at being spurned by Gemma, jetted off to his native Pakistan with Atiya before contacting her mother saying: 'You’ll never see your daughter again.' Despite a global inquiry spanning three countries, the youngster has not been heard of since and now it is feared she may have been sold by her father to another family living in Pakistan or Iran. Anjum returned to the UK less than a fortnight after he flew out and is now serving a fourth consecutive jail term for contempt after defiantly refusing to reveal Atiya’s whereabouts - dismissing Gemma as 'only a birth mother'. Today on what would be Atiya’s six birthday Miss Wilkinson sobbed as she pleaded for information about what happened to her daughter. 'I pray she’s okay but we don’t have any proof that she’s okay and no proof she is even still alive,' she said. 'It’s been discussed that she could have been sold, but I don’t want to believe it. 'As far as I’m aware she hasn’t been with any family member so I can only assume she’s with strangers. 'To know that she’s safe, to know that she’s being looked after, to know where she is. A child doesn’t disappear, doesn’t evaporate. A child is put somewhere and people know - and that information needs to be talked about.' Gemma met Anjum in 2003 while they were on the same college course at Oldham Business Management School and Atiya was born on November 7, 2006. But Gemma ended her on/off relationship with Anjum in 2008 due to him being possessive and controlling and he swore revenge on her. During an access visit on the youngster’s birthday he said he was taking Atiya to Southport but instead, he took her to Lahore where he claimed she was staying for a week with relatives. Adorable: Atiya before she was abducted. Police believe she may be being hidden in Pakistan . Mystery: A computer-generated image of what Atiya might look like now . Atiya was supposed to share a flight with her grandmother on November 16, but the grandmother came back alone. Anjum himself returned to the UK on November 20 without his daughter and he was subsequently arrested. He claimed he handed Atiya to a mystery man called Khan and taken to Iran but an address for the shady Mr Fixit proved to be false. Gemma said: 'It’s been an absolute nightmare. When I close my eyes I see Atiya. I say good night to her every night before bed. 'I just want Atiya back home but her father’s just not prepared to back down - he’s not prepared to work with the police. He’s enjoying playing his controlling mind games. 'It’s just sick.' Gemma and Razwan. He still refuses to reveal his daughter's whereabouts and has been given a fourth jail term for his silence . She added: 'We haven’t celebrated her birthday since she went missing but I’ve bought her presents each year - they are waiting for her to open when she comes home. 'On the day she went missing she was due to spend some time with Razwan. She was picked up by her uncle and taken to go see him. She was due to come back the next day and spend some time with her family opening presents. 'I had no reason to believe that she was at any risk. There had been a standard routine, there hadn’t been any problems with the arrangements. I really don’t know where she is. 'It looks as though she’s still in Pakistan. Razwan is refusing to say where she is, who she’s with and he won’t say anything other than she’s in Iran yet originally she was in Pakistan. 'He won’t give the actual location of where she is. He’s doing this because he has control over me. He had sent abusive text messages after our relationship ended and the last control he would have had over me was to hurt me through Aitya - he knows she’s everything to me. Missing: Anjum claimed he handed Atiya to a mystery man called Khan who took her to Iran but an address for the man proved to be false . 'I think he would be boasting about what he’s doing in prison, to make himself feel good about the control he has over us. I would do anything to get her back. I just want to know where she is, how she is,' she added. 'We’ve been trying to arrange meetings with his family but they don’t want to communicate with me. 'The police have tried to ask them for information, but they aren’t willing to cooperate. I don’t know any of his family over in Pakistan. 'I think someone in the community around the family knows something. I’m hoping the information that is known could be given so we know Aitya is safe, we know she is alive and that she’s at least settled. 'It shouldn’t be a game of control. I will be thinking about her on Tuesday, thinking about what she’s doing and who she’s with. She has a loving, doting family waiting for her. He shouldn’t be able to play games with children’s lives. We just want her home.' Police have launched a fresh appeal for information about Atiya's whereabouts . Ajum, who has a son from a previous relationship, has been the subject of several civil court actions ordering him to disclose where Atiya is but he supplied false information. He was initially jailed in June 2010 for a maximum two years at the Family Division of the High Court but has subsequently been given three more jail terms the latest imposed in March this year. One judge said it was the most 'cynical and cruel' form of abduction he had dealt with in his 30 year career. Det Con Emma Constantine of Greater Manchester Police said: 'As far as we know, Razwan has had no contact with Aitya himself. 'He’s never received any letters or photographs of Aitya. So there’s no way that he knows how she is. 'We’ve been to see him a few times. He maintains the facade she’s in Iran, but there’s no evidence to support that so we’re very sceptical. 'It’s only him that holds the information.' Supt Phil Owen said: 'We’re working with a range of international agencies in order to find out who may be harbouring her but it presents its challenges and problems and hopefully this is now the time to tug at heart strings and generate information from the public. 'We haven’t got any evidence to know she’s even alive. This is the only way he can exert control. 'He’s manipulative, he puts himself first. He will convince himself that she’s looked after and cared for but he doesn’t know that.'","Atiya Wilkinson was snatched by 'cruel' father three years ago .

A varistor, a variable resistor, believed to be similar to the one sent 15,000km to the Antarctic to try and save a £7m project to drill two miles under the ice . It is one of the most valuable deliveries ever made to the remote Antarctic ice. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey today took delivery of a thumbnail sized 'varistor' - a variable resistor believed to cost just £1 - that could save their £7m project. It was sent 15,000km after the original, and a spare, both failed, threatening the future of the ambitious project to drill 2 miles under the ice to look for signs of early life. Engineers will now attempt to fit the part in the next few days in the hope of restarting drilling next week. The drill is powered by . hot water, but was halted when the resister inside a boiler burned out. A spare was sent from Britain via Chile to the remote camp in West Antarctica. Twelve . scientists from the British Antarctic Survey have worked around the . clock over the past fortnight to bore 10,000ft down to ice-locked Lake . Ellsworth to collect samples of water and sediment. They . hope to find unique microbial life forms there which have been isolated . for at least 100,000 years - and probably much longer.

The team's 12 scientists have been working around the clock to try and save the mission . The malfunction could mean that the project, which took 16 years to plan, would have to be abandoned . The team had hoped to penetrate the thick ice cap to reach the lake last week, but technical difficulties have knocked them off schedule, pitting them in a race against time to complete the mission before their equipment freezes. The BAS team have been trying to melt their way down to Ellsworth using a 2 mile-long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to 90C at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch. However, when the scientists fired up their boiler's primary burner for the first time its controller circuit failed. A secondary burner was fitted and the team worked around the clock to shovel snow to feed the hot-water drill, and in four days they had melted enough to begin drilling the borehole to the cavity.

Drill testing at the base, where staff now face a race against time . The 12 scientists, from the British Antarctic Survey, are now in a race against time to complete the mission before the borehole reseals as they only have enough fuel for one attempt . But then, on Saturday afternoon, this secondary burner failed leaving the BAS team with nothing to do but wait for a replacement part as their bore hole - and equipment - slowly begins to freeze shut. 'We are now committed, having gone past the point of no return,' expedition leader Chris Hill told the Independent. 'If anything stops working now, water could freeze in the pipes and the whole programme could come to a halt.' Drilling preparations for the team, who admit that they only have one more chance to complete the project . The drill site in situe of the Ellsworth mountains. The £7million project to drill beneath two miles of Antarctic ice in search of undiscovered life hangs in the balance - after a major equipment failure. The BAS reports that the replacement components will be with the deep field team in a few days time. They will work with the manufacturers to make sure they install them properly. But if the replacement parts malfunction malfunction again the team will have no option other than to by pass the circuitry and manually 'drive' the burner - an operation that will require skill and a light touch. The Lake Ellsworth drill site on the West Antarctic ice sheet: Four British scientists arrived at the site yesterday to finalise preparations for drilling down to a lake locked beneath nearly 10,000ft of ice . For Queen and country: The mission is the most ambitious attempt yet to use hot water drilling to penetrate deep beneath the glaciers which coat our planets southernmost continent .

Earth's core and the intense pressure exerted by the weight of the ice . above that has kept it liquid. Should any organisms be found living . in its icy depths, they could offer tantalising clues as to how life . might look elsewhere in the solar system, such as in the ice-covered . oceans of Jupiter's moon Europa. Expedition leader Chris Hill confirmed they were past the point of no return and feared the water would re-freeze in the pipes and borehole, halting the programme.

The BAS team planned first to bore . down to 1,000ft, then stop to create a cavity, then drill a second . borehole from the surface down through the this cavity and all the way . down to the lake. The cavity is what controls the . pressure of the liquid being drawn from Ellsworth, stopping a geyser of . prehistoric water from bursting back up through the borehole and . spilling out over the surface of the ice. Once they reach the waters, they will . have just 24 hours to sterilise the entrance to the hole with intense UV . light and lower a probe into the lake to collect their samples before . the hole refreezes again.

A huge aquatic lizard has been discovered that terrorised European rivers 84 million years ago. The new species was discovered in Hungary is the first known example of a group of scaled reptiles to have lived in freshwater river environments. They were the biggest and most dangerous predators in the water and occupied a similar niche to freshwater dolphins of today. Mosasaurs were terrifying aquatic predators which evolved to live in both the seas and freshwater rivers. Researchers believe the largest of the ancient lizards grew up to 20 feet (6m) long, though most would have been 10-13 feet (3-4m). The new species was named Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus by the scientists who discovered it. Armed with rows of sharp teeth they would have siezed and eaten anything they could get into their mouths. It belonged to the mosasaur family which most fossil remains have show to be monstrous sea creatures. But the fossil remains from Hungary are believed by scientists to have come from a freshwater predator that shared its tropical environment with crocodiles. Fossil remains of the newly discovered creature represent a range of individuals, ranging from small juveniles to large adults. They had limbs like a terrestrial lizard, a flattened, crocodile-like skull, and a tail unlike other known members of the mosasaur family. The fossils were recovered from an open-pit mine in the Bakony Hills which were once flood-plains. Some of the fossilised bones were so little weathered that the animal they belonged to is believed to have been washed away in a sudden flood and rapidly buried. According to the study, this is the first known mosasaur that lived in freshwater and only the second to have been found in rocks that were not once deposited in the ocean. Researchers pieced together a haul of fossils from an ancient Hungarian flood plain to reveal Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus . Laszlo Makadi, of the Hungarian Natural History Museum who conducted the study with colleagues from the University of Alberta in Canada, said the ancient lizard family evolved to adapt to several different freshwater environments. 'The evidence we provide here makes it clear that similar to some lineages of cetaceans, mosasaurs quickly adapted to a variety of aquatic environments, with some groups re-invading available niches in freshwater habitats,' he said.'The size of Pannoniasaurus makes it the largest known predator in the waters of this paleo-environment.' The Hungarian and Canadian research team added in their report, published in the journal PLoS ONE: 'We consider the crocodile-like flattened skull to be a useful adaptation for water-level ambush hunting of terrestrial and shallow water prey.'","Newly discovered reptile lurked just beneath the surface to ambush prey .

A map of biodiversity showing the organisation of terrestrial life on Earth has been updated after more than a century. The original map, drawn up by British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in 1876, was the first attempt to depict the myriad ways life has evolved on the world's continents. Advances in modern technology and data on more than 20,000 species have now allowed scientists to chart biodiversity in far more detail. The new map shows the division of nature into 11 large biogeographic realms and how they relate to each other . The first attempt to describe the natural world in an evolutionary context was made in 1876 by Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of the theory of natural selection, along with Charles Darwin. Now his map has finally been updated. The new map, published online by the journal Science, shows the division of nature into 11 large biogeographic realms and how they relate to each other. Evolutionary and geographical information is combined for all known mammals, birds and amphibians - a total of more than 20,000 species. A team of 15 international researchers took 20 years to compile the data. Lead scientist Dr Ben Holt, from the Centre for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said: 'Our study is a long overdue update of one of the most fundamental maps in natural sciences. 'For the first time since Wallace's attempt we are finally able to provide a broad description of the natural world based on incredibly detailed information for thousands of vertebrate species.' The freely available map can be split into finer geographical details for each class of animal. The original map, drawn up by British naturalist Alfred Russell Wallace in 1876 . Co-author Dr Jean-Philippe Lessard, from McGill University in Canada, said: 'The map provides important baseline information for future ecological and evolutionary research. 'It also has major conservation significance in light of the on-going biodiversity crisis and global environmental change.' 'Whereas conservation planners have been identifying priority areas based on the uniqueness of species found in a given place, we can now begin to define conservation priorities based on millions of years of evolutionary history.' Dr Carsten Rahbek, director of the Centre for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate, said the holistic description of the natural world provided by the map could be a 'new cornerstone in fundamental biology'.","Original map was drawn up by British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in 1876 .

As Radio 2 prepares to reveal listeners' favourites, David ­Thomas presents his own... BROWN SUGAR BY THE ROLLING STONES (APRIL 1971) Has any other song persuaded more middle-aged men to be fools on the dance floor? Inspired by Mick Jagger's affair with black American singer-actress Marsha Hunt, with whom he fathered a child, and propelled by one of Keith Richards' finest guitar-riffs, it's a spicy stew of slavery, sadism and inter-racial sex. No surprise that Jagger declares it ‘one of my favourites'. Beaten to No.1 by: Dawn's Knock Three Times, a pallid piece of production-line pop. Chart success: The Rolling Stones have had plenty of hits since missing the top spot in 1971 . MY GENERATION BY THE WHO (NOVEMBER 1965) Pete Townshend may have written 'Hope I die before I get old', but he’s now 67 and My Generation is a classic. Yet it sounds as angry and frenzied as ever. Roger Daltrey's famous stuttering vocal was an ­accident. Not having rehearsed, he was trying to fit the words to the music, stumbled over them and the band liked the sound so much they kept it.

Let them entertain you: From stadium rockers to pop princesses, here's where to catch the acts that will make 2013 go with a bang . LAST CHRISTMAS BY WHAM (DECEMBER 1984)The best-selling No. 2 in UK chart history, with 1.6 million copies, it would have made No. 1 had Bob Geldof and Midge Ure not formed Band Aid and released Do They Know It's Christmas? After a complaint from Barry Manilow, Last Christmas was judged too similar to his hit Can't Smile Without You and a legal settlement saw George Michael giving his first year’s royalties to Band Aid. Beaten to No.1 by: Do They Know It's Christmas? — with an appearance by George Michael. WATERLOO SUNSET BY THE KINGS (MAY 1967)performed at the London Olympics closing ceremony, this was going to be called Liverpool Sunset because Kinks songwriter Ray Davies considered himself 'an adopted Scouser'. The lovers Terry and Julie are not, as often claimed, Sixties icons Terence Stamp and Julie Christie, but were inspired by Davies’s sister and her boyfriend, and the name of his nephew, Terry Davies. Beaten to No.1 by: The Tremeloes' Silence is Golden — not quite rubbish, but almost. Rivals: Rock legend David Bowie was beaten to No. 1 by Jimmy Osmond's Long Haired Lover From Liverpool . THE JEAN GENIE BY DAVID BOWIE (DECEMBER 1972)one of David Bowie's greatest singles, released at the peak of his Ziggy Stardust glory. But it was outsold by the high-pitched squeaks of chubby, nine-year-old Little Jimmy Osmond. To make matters worse, the song that replaced Jimmy at No.1, The Sweet's Blockbuster, had the exact same guitar riff as Jean Genie. Beaten to No.1 by: Little Jimmy Osmond’s Long-Haired Lover From Liverpool. STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER/PENNY LANE BY THE BEATLES (FEBRUARY 1967) The tracks of this double A-side describe the Liverpool of the group's childhood. John Lennon’s Strawberry Fields — named after a Salvation Army home in the gardens of which he played as a child — is an impressionistic, druggy song about his feelings of alienation. Paul McCartney’s Penny Lane is much sunnier, but still filled with complex musical effects and surreal ­verbal imagery. Beatles ­producer George ­Martin calls this the greatest single they ever released. Beaten to No.1 by: Engelbert Humperdinck's Release Me, a slice of cruise-singer cheese that was, shockingly, the best-selling single of 1967. VIENNA BY ULTRAVOX (JANUARY 1981) Pure early Eighties, its crooning vocal by Midge Ure was modelled on David Bowie. The video combined a pastiche of The Third Man, with a party scene filled with gaudily painted New Romantics and Brideshead Revisited wannabes. Yet it was denied by a novelty song, to the horror of real music fans. Beaten to No.1 by: Joe Dolce's Shaddap You Face. Rocket man: Pop giant Elton John was missed out on chart success in 1972 thanks to T Rex's Metal Guru . WILD THING BY THE TROGGS (MAY 1966)Dumb, but irresistible, Wild Thing was written by Chip ­Taylor, brother of the actor Jon Voight and uncle of Angelina Jolie. The Troggs, from Andover in Hampshire, recorded the song in a matter of minutes. Beaten to No.1 by: The Stones' Paint It Black — fair enough. ROCKET MAN BY ELTON JOHN (APRIL 1972) The words came to lyricist Bernie Taupin as he drove to his parents' Grimsby home, and he had to repeat the first lines, starting 'I packed my bag last night, pre-flight . . .' in his head until he got there. It was cited as an inspiration by ­England's Ashes-winning cricket team in 2005. Beaten to No.1 by: T. Rex's Metal Guru — no disgrace to lose to Marc Bolan at his peak. WONDERWALL BY OASIS (October 1995) Their biggest hit, selling 1.26 million copies in the UK and the band's only top-ten U.S. single. With a title taken from a 1968 film, Wonderwall was written for Noel Gall­agher's wife Meg Mathews, but he changed his mind after their divorce, preferring to describe it as a song about friendship. Beaten to No.1 by: Robson and Jerome's I Believe/Up On The Roof, an abolute travesty of musical justice. Second best: Oasis (left) and Petula Clark (right) got to No. 2 with their arguably most famous hits . HEARTBREAK HOTEL BY ELVIS PRESLEY (JANUARY 1956) Possibly the most influential record in pop history. Co-written in under an hour by Mae Axton, the Florida high school teacher who first introduced Elvis Presley to his manager ‘Colonel’ Tom Parker, it was recorded in January 1956, two days after Presley's 21st birthday. It inspired a ­generation of teenage boys to become the rock superstars of the Sixties and Seventies. John Lennon recalled: 'We didn’t know what Elvis was singing about. It just sounded like a noise that was great.' Beaten to No.1 by: Pat Boone's I’ll Be Home, a piece of insipid crooning, that has long been forgotten. FAIRYTALE OF NEW YORK BY THE POGUES, WITH KIRST MACCOLL (DECEMBER 1987) Fairytale Of New York has been voted the UK's favourite Christmas song in at least five polls. Yet it was only written because Elvis Costello bet Pogues singer Shane MacGowan (born Christmas Day 1957) he couldn't come up with a Christmas song. Kirsty MacColl recorded her brilliant vocal by chance: her husband Steve Lillywhite produced The Pogues. Beaten to No.1 by: The Pet Shop Boys' Always On My Mind - 'We were beaten by two queens and a drum machine,' moaned MacGowan. GOD SAVE THE QUEEN BY THE SEX PISTOLS (MAY 1977) Johnny Rotten is now John Lydon and makes TV ads for butter, but in 1977 the Sex Pistols were the leaders of a punk revolution. Released in time for the Silver Jubilee, God Save The Queen's cover showed Her Majesty with her eyes and mouth crudely obscured by the song title and the band's name. Rock legend has it that the charts were deliberately rigged to keep God Save the Queen off the No.1 spot. Beaten to No.1 by: (or was it?) Rod Stewart’s classy I Don't Want to Talk About It/First Cut is the Deepest . No fairytale: The Pogues could not make the top spot with their Christmas classic . DOWNTOWN BY PETULA CLARK (NOVEMBER 1964) Clark had already been in showbiz for 20 years when she sang Downtown. It remains a great, feelgood pop song that was a hit all over the world - the first million-selling single by a British woman in the U.S. It spent three weeks at No.2, stuck behind The Beatles. Beaten to No.1 by:  The Beatles' I Feel Fine. IN THE AIR TONIGHT BY PHIL COLLINS (JANUARY 1981) Written after the break-up of his first marriage, In The Air Tonight sets bitterly caustic words against a massive drum-beat. Collins performed the song on Top Of The Pops with a paint-pot on his drum-machine — pure coincidence, he insists, though many thought it was a reference to the decorator for whom his wife had left him.

It is a newly discovered natural wonder, a living natural reef made up of 100million brightly coloured shellfish carpeting the seabed. But while the spectacular colony of flame shells may look like something from tropical waters, it has actually been found off Scotland’s coast. A survey of Loch Alsh, a sea inlet between Skye and the mainland, uncovered what scientists believe could be the world’s biggest single population of  the creatures. Loch and awe: The flame shells live in giant colonies . The flame shells, or Limaria hians, form a large shellfish reef on the west coast of Scotland, which could be the biggest find of its kind in the world . Flame shells build 'nests' by binding gravel and shells together with thin wiry threads. Although each measures around 4cm long, when they group together in large numbers, the sea bed is covered by a felt-like organic reef of material several centimetres thick. Flame shell beds are found at only eight sites in Scottish waters. The 1.5inch long, scallop-like species has numerous neon orange tentacles that emerge between its two shells. Colonies create ‘nests’ by binding gravel and shells together with thin threads. According to a survey commissioned by Marine Scotland, the Loch Alsh colony covers 75 hectares (185 acres) of seabed. This has created a living reef that supports hundreds of other species. Flame shells are considered scarce and beds are found in only eight sites in Scottish waters. As part of the work to identify new Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), Marine Scotland has co-ordinated a programme of eight surveys during 2012, including Loch Alsh, covering more than 640 square miles of sea. The Loch Alsh survey was carried out by Heriot Watt University on behalf of Marine Scotland. Dr Dan Harries, of Heriot Watt, said: ‘Too often, when we go out to check earlier records of a particular species or habitat, we find them damaged, struggling or even gone. The incredible find was made in Loch Alsh in the Isles of Skye in Scotland . ‘We are delighted that in this instance we found not just occasional patches but a huge and thriving flame shell community extending right the way along the entrance narrows of Loch Alsh.’ Ben James, of Scottish Natural Heritage, said: ‘Whilst we had some records of flame shells in Loch Alsh, we had no idea how big the bed was. We needed more certainty before recommending them as a protected feature of this MPA proposal. ‘It’s great to have this new information and it’s yet another example of the fantastic diversity of Scotland’s marine environment.’ Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said: ‘The seas around Scotland are a hotbed of biodiversity and the clean and cold waters support many fascinating and beautiful species. Marine experts are 'delighted' at the find, in a sea inlet off the Isles of Skye . ‘With Scottish waters covering an area around five times bigger than our landmass, it’s a huge challenge to try to understand more about our diverse and precious sea life. The flame shell must be considered among the most remarkable species in our waters, with a dazzling array of orange tentacles.’ Mr Lochhead added: ‘Many would place such an exotic species in far-flung tropical reefs, not realising they dwell under the waves just off the coast of Skye. ‘This important discovery may be the largest grouping of flame shells anywhere in the world. ‘And not only are flame shells beautiful to look at, these enigmatic shellfish form a reef that offers a safe and productive environment for many other species.’","Astonishing natural reef found near Isles of Skye .

Honoured: Hector Sants, who spent five years as head of the FSA, has been given a knighthood despite widespread criticism of how the regulator failed during the financial crisis . A city regulator accused of being ‘asleep at the wheel’ in the run up to the financial crash is knighted in the honours list. Hector Sants, who spent five years as head of the Financial Services Authority, receives the honour despite widespread criticism that the regulator had failed during the banking crisis. Mr Sants, who recently landed a £3million job at scandal-hit Barclays, once warned the banks that they should ‘be frightened of the FSA’. But the regulator was so discredited by its handling of the financial crisis that it is due to be scrapped next year. Earlier this month even the Queen questioned whether the FSA had the ‘teeth’ to deal with the banking crisis. Mr Sants joined the FSA in a senior position in 2004 and took over as chief executive in July 2007, just weeks before the run on Northern Rock that heralded the banking crisis. MPs on the Commons Treasury committee accused him of being ‘asleep at the wheel’ as the crisis took hold, although he later insisted the run on the bank could have been prevented if ministers and the Bank of England had followed his advice. Mr Sants also approved the Royal Bank of Scotland’s disastrous takeover of Dutch bank ABN Amro, which left the Scottish bank needing a £45billion bailout from the taxpayer in 2008. He has since said he is ‘truly sorry’ for the failure of RBS, adding that the FSA did not have the power to block the deal but acknowledging that he ‘could have shouted louder’ about his concerns. Big earner: Mr Sants recently secured a £3 million job at scandal-hit Barclays . The 56-year-old former investment banker was also in charge when HBOS was permitted to go on an extraordinary lending spree that saw it forced into a disastrous merger with Lloyds. But while he was criticised for the FSA’s failure to spot and prevent the credit crunch and subsequent banking meltdown, he has since won praise for cleaning up the regulator and for his role in forcing banks to beef up their balance sheets. Mr Sants later laid the blame for the crisis at the door of the US and UK governments, saying authorities worldwide sought to ‘encourage a significant credit boom particularly for the benefit of consumers who wished to purchase housing’. Mr Sants said yesterday that his knighthood was a ‘testament to the hard work of everyone at the FSA during the crisis, their willingness to learn lessons and to bring about the changes that were necessary’. He had been lined up to head the FSA’s successor body before abruptly stepping down last summer. Next month he joins Barclays as head of compliance. The bank is still reeling from revelations about its role in the Libor interest rate fixing scandal. Senior: Mr Sants joined the FSA in a senior . position in 2004 and took over as chief executive in July 2007, just . weeks before the run on Northern Rock that heralded the banking crisis . The FSA was accused by MPs of being ‘two years behind’ US regulators in dealing with the scandal, which involved manipulation of the rate at which banks lend to each other. Meanwhile, economist Sir Alan Budd is given a second knighthood after agreeing to come out of retirement to found the Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides independent forecasts on the economy for the Treasury. Sir Alan, a founder member of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, is made a Knight Grand Cross. ÷Property tycoon Michael Heller leads a list of Tory donors honoured in the New Year list.

Fellow Tory donor Terry Bramall is made a CBE, also for services to philanthropy. Businessman Mr Bramall has given £60,000 to the party in the past. Both men also have long track records in charitable giving. Construction boss Tony Pidgley, who has also given modest sums to the Tories in the past, is also made a CBE.

A 24-year-old woman has been arrested for buying the assault rifle used to murder two innocent firefighters on Christmas Eve, on behalf of the killer. Dawn Nguyen of Rochester, New York, was a former neighbor of William Spengler, 62, who shot dead firefighters Michael Chiapperini and Tomasz Kaczowka in a shocking ambush as they responded to a house fire he started early Monday morning. Three other people were wounded before Spengler killed himself. According to police, Nguyen purchased the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and a 12-gauge shotgun on behalf of Spengler, a convicted felon who was barred from possessing weapons, on June 6, 2010. Accessory: Dawn Nguyen, 24, pictured centre, is charged in connection with the guns used in the Christmas Eve ambush slaying of two volunteer firefighters . Spengler is believed to have picked out the weapons himself at a firearm store in Henrietta, New York. The young woman faces a federal charge of knowingly making a false statement, U.S. Attorney William Hochul said, and is also charged with a state count of filing a falsified business record. The gunman also had a .38-caliber revolver in his possession on the day of the shootings, but Nguyen is not connected to that gun. Police used the serial numbers on the weapons to trace them to Nguyen. Killer: William Spengler had previously served 17 years in prison for killing his elderly grandmother . 'She told the seller of these guns, Gander Mountain in Henrietta, N.Y., that she was to be the true owner and buyer of the guns instead of William Spengler,' Hochul said. 'It is absolutely against federal law to provide any materially false information related to the acquisition of firearms.' During an interview late on Christmas Eve, Nguyen told police she had bought the guns for personal protection and that they were stolen from her vehicle, though she never reported the guns stolen. The day after the shootings, however, . Nguyen texted an off-duty Monroe County Sheriff's deputy with . references to the killings and later admitted to him that she bought the . guns for Spengler. Police said that information was consistent with a suicide note found near Spengler's body after he killed himself. The .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle, . which had a combat-style flash suppressor, is similar to the one Adam . Lanza used to shoot dead 20 children and six female staff at Sandy Hook . Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, earlier this month. Nguyen and her mother, Dawn Welsher, . lived next door to Spengler in 2008 - when Nguyen was just 20 years old. On Wednesday and again on Friday, shortly before her arrest, she . answered her cellphone and told The Associated Press that she didn't . want to talk about Spengler. Her brother, Steven Nguyen, told the . Democrat and Chronicle newspaper of Rochester that Spengler stole the . guns from Dawn Nguyen. Bushmaster: Nguyen allegedly bought the Bushmaster rifle, pictured, for William Spengler and he used it to shoot two firefighters . Home: Dawn Nguyen was arrested at her home, pictured, at 249 Alpine Road in Rochester, New York . Spengler set a car on fire and . touched off an inferno in his Webster home on a strip of land along the . Lake Ontario shore, took up a sniper's position and opened fire on the . first firefighters to arrive at about 5:30am on Christmas Eve, . authorities said. He wounded two other firefighters and an off-duty . police officer who was on his way to work. A Webster police officer who had . accompanied the firefighters shot back at Spengler with a rifle in a . brief exchange of gunfire before the gunman killed himself. Spengler spent 17 years in prison for . killing his grandmother in 1980. His neighbors said he confessed his . criminal past within 15 minutes of them meeting, and even pointed to the . staircase where he committed the crime. 'He said, ""I was on drugs and I . wanted money for drugs and my grandmother wouldn't give it to me,""' Amy . Warner, who bought the cottage next to Spengler's home with her . boyfriend this summer, told New York Magazine. She said they tore out the staircase . 'because it was creepy,' but didn't think twice about buying the house . because Spengler had served his time. Her home was one of seven destroyed by the fire Spengler started. Trap: This billowing inferno in Webster, New York, was lit by William Spengler, before he opened fire on the firefighters who responded to the blaze . Brave: Webster police Lieutenant Mike . Chiapperini (left) and . Tomasz Kaczowka, (right) a 911 dispatcher, both volunteered for the West . Webster Fire Department. They were gunned down on Monday morning . Burning: A bystander watches while seven homes in a street in Webster, New York, burned on Monday . Investigators still haven't released the identity of remains found in William Spengler's burned house. They have said they believe the remains are those of his 67-year-old sister, Cheryl Spengler, who also lived in the house near Rochester and has been unaccounted for since the killings. The Spengler siblings had lived in the home with their mother, Arline Spengler, who died in October. Police found a rambling, typed letter laying out Spengler's intention to destroy his neighborhood and 'do what I like doing best, killing people.'

Jean Harris, the patrician girls' school headmistress who spent 12 years in prison for the 1980 killing of her long-time lover, ‘Scarsdale Diet’ doctor Herman Tarnower, in a case that rallied feminists and inspired television movies, has died. She was 89. Harris died Sunday at an assisted-living facility in New Haven, Connecticut, her son, James Harris, said Friday. She had claimed the shooting of Tarnower, 69, was an accident. Convicted of murder in 1981, Harris suffered two heart attacks while serving her sentence in the Bedford Hills women's prison north of New York City. Gone: Jean Harris, who spent 12 years in prison for the 1980 killing of her long-time lover, 'Scarsdale Diet' doctor Herman Tarnower, died Sunday, in New Haven, Connecticut. She was 89 . Prison heart problems: Convicted of murder in 1981, Mrs Harris suffered two heart attacks while serving her sentence in the Bedford Hills women's prison north of New York City . She was granted clemency by then-Governor Mario Cuomo when she underwent heart bypass surgery in December 1992 and was released on parole three weeks later. She later founded Children of Bedford Inc., a non-profit organization to provide scholarships and tutoring for children of female prison inmates. Her trial for shooting Tarnower, the millionaire cardiologist famous for devising the Scarsdale Diet — a weight-loss book and sensation of the 1970s named for the New York suburb where he practiced — brought feminists rallying to her defense. They pictured her as a woman victimized by a male-dominated society, adrift because she was getting older and her lover of 14 years was brushing her off in favor of his younger office assistant. In addition, they said, she was in the thrall of antidepressant drugs Tarnower had prescribed for her. The murder case inspired two made-for-television movies, ‘The People vs. Jean Harris,’ which aired not long after her 1981 conviction, and ‘Mrs. Harris,’ which ran on HBO in 2006. She was played by actress Ellen Burstyn in  ‘The People vs. Jean Harris' and actress Annette Bening in 'Mrs. Harris.' Made for television: Her case inspired two made-for-television movies, 'The People vs. Jean Harris,' which aired not long after her 1981 conviction, and 'Mrs. Harris,' which ran on HBO in 2006 . Portrayed: Jean Harris was played by actress Ellen Burstyn in 'The People vs. Jean Harris' and actress Annette Bening in 'Mrs. Harris' Harris always maintained that she went armed to Tarnower's Westchester County estate in Purchase on March 10, 1980, to confront him over his womanizing and kill herself, but unintentionally shot him four times in a struggle over the gun. She later acknowledged at a parole hearing that she was ‘certainly guilty of something. I caused the man's death.’ A jury convicted her of murder, and she was sentenced to 15 years to life. Her lawyer had unsuccessfully gambled on an all-or-nothing strategy that eschewed an ‘extreme emotional disturbance’ defense and did not allow the jury to consider a lesser charge such as manslaughter. Jurors said afterward it was Harris's own testimony that led them to convict her. They said they tried to re-enact her account of the struggle for the gun and did not find it credible. Leaving prison: Mrs Harris, handcuffed and carrying a book, was photographed on March 20, 1981, leaving the Westchester County Jail on her way to to the Westchester County Courthouse in Valhalla, New York . The defense maintained that jealousy was not a factor. But during cross-examination, the prosecutor introduced a letter written just prior to the shooting in which Harris referred to her rival as an ‘ignorant slut’ and ‘a vicious, adulterous psychotic.’ ‘The fact was, Jean Harris was too much of a lady to admit that she was jealous of the office girl,’ the late author Shana Alexander wrote in her book about the case, ‘Very Much a Lady.’ ‘She would rather go to prison than acknowledge it. And she did.’ As an inmate, Harris criticized authority, chafing under what she saw as arbitrary, counterproductive rules. In books and articles she wrote and in interviews, she advocated reform, both for her own benefit and that of other imprisoned women. Housed in the prison's honor wing, she taught mothering skills to expectant inmates and worked in the Bedford Hills children's center. Born Jean Streuven on April 27, 1923, she grew up in the Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights, attended private schools, graduated magna cum laude from Smith College and married industrialist James Harris. Trial: Mrs Harris was photographed on February 24, 1981, arriving at the Westchester County Courthouse to hear the verdict in her second-degree murder trial with her are defense lawyers William Reigleman and Bonnie Steingar . The couple lived in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, and had two sons. Harris also got her first job there, teaching first grade. She and James Harris divorced in 1966. A few months later, the slender, blond, blue-eyed divorcee of 43 met Tarnower, 12 years her senior, at a party on Park Avenue in New York. They talked about marriage early in the relationship, but that never panned out, and Harris remained his lover. In 1977, she left a sales administration job in New York to become headmistress of the Madeira School for girls in the Washington suburb of McLean, Virginia, a position that also got her listed in the capital's social register. Weekends and vacations were spent with Tarnower, traveling or on his arm at social gatherings. She also earned a mention in the acknowledgments in his best-selling diet book, ‘The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet,’ for helping with research. But Tarnower's dalliances with other, younger women drove Harris to desperation, and, according to her account, she decided to drive from Virginia to his home and kill herself in his presence. Convicted of murder: Mrs Harris sitting at a table in the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York after she was was convicted for murdering her former lover Dr. Herman Tarnower . She testified at her trial: ‘In Westchester, I always felt I was a woman in a pretty dress that went to dinner parties with Dr. Tarnower. In Washington, I was a woman in a pretty dress and a headmistress. I wasn't sure who I was, and it didn't seem to matter.’ The expensively dressed Harris came across as snobbish, arrogant and jealous of the younger woman who had replaced her as the principal object of Tarnower's attention. During the trial, it was assumed that Harris insisted on testifying about the fateful last meeting in Tarnower's bedroom. She later said she would not have taken the stand had her lawyer told her to ‘keep quiet.’ Renowned female educator: In 1977, Mrs Harris left a sales administration job in New York to become headmistress of the Madeira School for girls in the Washington suburb of McLean, Virginia .","Jean Harris, who spent 12 years in prison for the 1980 killing of her long-time lover, ‘Scarsdale Diet’ doctor Herman Tarnower, died at an assisted-living facility in New Haven, Connecticut on Sunday .

Margaret Thatcher was behind radical proposals to end free healthcare and schooling in Britain which proved so contentious they sparked what was described as a 'riot' in cabinet, newly-released documents reveal. A 1982 cabinet memorandum by the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS), released today under the National Archives under the 30-year-rule, details plans for a massive scaling back of public services. According to her memoirs, Mrs Thatcher was 'horrified' when she first saw the paper which was never seriously considered by her or any of her ministers. Rolling back the frontiers: Mrs Thatcher and her then chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe commissioned a think tank to come up with radical plans to cut public spending, newly-released documents reveal . She wrote: ' I pointed out that it would almost certainly be leaked and give a totally false impression. 'It was all a total nonsense.' However records show that not only was the memorandum fully considered at an extended cabinet discussion on September 9, 1982, but that Mrs Thatcher and her then Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe had requested the CPRS to come up with such radical suggestions in the first place. According to Nigel Lawson, who was the energy Secretary at the time, the incendiary report sparked 'the nearest thing to a cabinet riot in the history of the Thatcher administration.' Despite Mrs Thatcher's public . denunciation of the report, it was, in reality, far from the product of a . renegade group of radical right-wingers acting purely off their own . initiative. According to a report in the Guardian, . The newly released documents show how it had been commissioned by Mrs . Thatcher and Mr Howe with the latter telling the PM: 'We should not be . inhibited at this stage by such considerations as the alleged . impossibility of change. Nigel Lawson said the report nearly prompted a riot in the cabinet . 'A discussion of this kind would pave the . way for some major strategic decisions affecting our programmes as a . government for the next parliament.' One of the authors was . David Cameron's current advisor on crime and policing, Lord Wasserman, . who, in a background paper for the education section, proposed cutting . 25 per cent of state-school teachers. A copy of the report was subsequently leaked to the press which proposed the introduction of education vouchers, an ending state-funded higher education, freezing welfare benefits and an insurance-based health service similar to the US system. But what was not known at the time was that this was merely a watered-down version of the real thing which went far further. The original version included such radical proposals as compulsory charges for schooling as well as a 'drastic reduction in resources going to the public sector'. There would also be no deductions in university fees and a breaking of the link between welfare benefits and prices. But by far the paper's most contentious proposal was to end the state provision of healthcare which would have effectively meant an end to the NHS. It reads: 'It is therefore worth considering aiming over a period to end the state provision of healthcare for the bulk of the population, so that medical facilities would be privately owned and run and those seeking healthcare would be required to pay for it. 'Those who could not afford to pay would then have their charges met by the state, via some form of rebating or reimbursement.' Mentally handicapped or elderly patients requiring long term institutional care who 'clearly could not afford to pay', would be the only exceptions.","She and chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe commissioned confidential report .

"By . Helen Pow . PUBLISHED: . 10:00 EST, 5 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:05 EST, 5 December 2012 . A former American Apparel store manager is accusing the racy clothing company's CEO of 'rubbing dirt on his face' amid a string of verbal and physical abuse and then firing him without a reason. Michael Bumblis, 24, of Inglewood, California, has filed a lawsuit against Dov Charney, claiming the boss 'abused his position and power and, in doing so, flaunted employment laws.' Mr Bumblis was hired in March 2009 and rose up the ranks to eventually manage one of the retail stores in Malibu before he was sacked on July 24. In the suit, filed in a Los Angeles court on November 29, the former worker is alleging assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violation of civil rights, discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation and religious affiliation and wrongful termination. Lawsuit: Dov Charney, pictured, is being sued by former manager Michael Bumblis for harassment and unfair dismissal . According to ABC News, Mr Bumblis claims he became 'increasingly agitated and anxious at work, was unable to fully concentrate and was increasingly absent from work due to his anxiety and distress.' Mr Charney has a 'well known, long and unenviable reputation for aggressive, violent, erratic, inappropriate, and harassing behavior towards others, including (American Apparel's) employees,' the documents state. Mr Bumblis alleges that the 43-year-old who 'periodically' visited the store 'usually on an hour's notice' threatened him on one of their first encounters after greeting him at a February convention in Las Vegas while he was standing next to an unnamed woman. In April, Mr Charney called him and 'launched into an expletive ridden diatribe,' the young man claims, and asked if he was 'banging that girl you were with in Vegas.' Racy: The lawsuit comes as the company has again fallen foul of advertising standards for its use of young models in its campaigns, pictured . According to the suit, Mr Charney said: . 'You should have been ****ing fired months ago,' and abused him for . being Jewish and gay, though Mr Bumblis says he's neither. The former staffer says on another occasion, Mr Charney came to the store he managed to inspect construction work and, after the pair allegedly quarreled about a new inventory system, 'dove' at him. He says the boss 'grabbed' him around the neck with both hands 'and began to forcibly squeeze (his) throat in an attempt to choke or strangle' him. During the same visit, Mr Bumblis claims Mr Charney called him over after spotting some dirt in a space between a fitting room wall and the store wall, saying, 'Come here! Look how disgusting you are.' He allegedly told him: 'Rub it on your face,' before proceeding to 'scoop up the dirt and forcibly attempt to rub the dirt on plaintiff's face,' the suit claims. The company has denied the allegations and highlighted that the former employee signed a gag order as part of his contract. Attack: Mr Bumblis claims Mr Charney 'dove' at his and tried to strangle him before rubbing dirt in his face . 'The allegations in this lawsuit are false and Mr Bumblis and his lawyers know that any complaints the company may have against Mr Bumblis, or complaints he may have against the company, are to be addressed in binding arbitration, not in the media or the courts,' Mr Charney's lawyer Peter Schey said in a statement to ABC News. 'In addition to the conduct that led to his termination, Mr Bumblis has also violated his written agreement to arbitrate any disputes with the company. We will shortly initiate arbitration against Mr Bumblis and have no doubt that the court will require that he join the arbitration proceedings where we expect the company's claims against him will be upheld.' Mr Schey insists Mr Bumblis was fired for 'reasons fully consistent with company policy.' American Apparel employs about 10,000 people worldwide with around 5,000 based in Los Angeles.  It operates over 285 retail stores in 20 countries and is well known for its use of young models in its racy advertising campaigns. The lawsuit comes as the company has again fallen foul of the advertising watchdog with campaigns featuring 'gratuitous' images and the sexualisation of models who appeared to be under 16. The clothing brand ran into similar issues with campaigns in 2009 and earlier this year but it responded to the two separate, latest, complaints by saying 'it was standard practice to market hosiery, intimates or lingerie in the way done on their website'.","Michael Bumblis of Inglewood, California, filed a lawsuit against Dov Charney on November 29 .

Antjuan Miguel Colvin, who friends say could have been struggling with depression, wrote the lengthy post on his Facebook page at around 9pm on Christmas Eve. 'To all my friends and family on .

Loss: Antjuan Colvin posted a lengthy farewell post to Facebook before driving onto train tracks . At 9.48pm, he drove his car onto a railroad crossing in Hughson, California and was struck by a train travelling at 75 mph. He was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities told the Modesto Bee. Before his death, family and friends who read his post scrambled to contact the troubled man, with many asking on Facebook if he was okay or whether the message was a joke. 'I didn't know what to think when I saw . it,' friend Olivia Johnson, 22, told the Bee. 'I called his phone like 100 times.

Colvin was hit by a San Joaquin Train from Bakersfield to Sacramento. It was carrying 98 passengers and was delayed for two hours after the crash. Three people were shaken up and treated at the scene for minor injuries. The conductor was the only witness to the crash, Stanislaus County sheriff's Sgt. Anthony Bejaran said. 'It's horrible for the conductor and horrible for the family, who will always have to remember Christmas Day as a day they lost a family member,' Bejaran said. 'I can't imagine that.'

When friends asked him about the post, he simply wrote: 'something im (sic) trying to deal with on my own right now', the Bee reported. In November, Colvin posted a . picture with a quote reading: 'I hide all of my problems behind . my smile. Behind my smile is a world of pain. You think you know me, but . you have no idea.' Beside the picture he wrote: 'True.' His former live-in girlfriend, Savanna Callahan, 24, said that he was often overcome with depression. 'I am in shock. But only to an . extent,' she said. 'When me and him broke up, he said he wasn't strong . enough to be my boyfriend. I had hoped he'd gained strength. He was very . sweet. He liked everybody.' Scene: He drove onto these tracks in Hughson, California and was struck by a train travelling around 75 mph . His Facebook page also shows hundreds of smiling pictures and his plans for trips.

Johnson paid tribute to her friend, saying: 'He was just an awesome person; he had the best smile on his face and always knew how to make people laugh. He was just a wonderful person.' But she has been left with questions surrounding his death, and wishes she could have helped. 'I just don't understand,' she said.

England will be the only part of the UK where free plastic bags are not outlawed after the Treasury blocked calls for a levy. George Osborne is understood to be nervous about imposing extra costs on shoppers at a time of austerity. The Chancellor rejected calls from Liberal Democrats who were pushing for a levy of between 5p and 10p per bag . The Liberal Democrats claim the Treasury has been the last stumbling block to securing a levy on plastic bags to rubbish, seen here in Hyde Park . The refusal to take action has dismayed some MPs. Tory . Zac Goldsmith said: 'I understand the Treasury’s concern about adding . expense for shoppers, but a levy of this sort would be voluntary, and . therefore absolutely avoidable. 'Nor . would it be a stealth tax, because all the proceeds from people who . choose to continue buying throw-away bags would be recycled back to . community charities. 'I . can see no good reason at all why England should be the only part of . the UK without this popular and easy conservation measure.' It is understood the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs appealed to the Treasury in to include the measure in the Autumn Statement. Lib Dem farming minister David Heath raised hopes in October, telling MPs a decision would be made 'sooner rather than later' to limit the environmental impact of throw-away bags. But Mr Osborne did not include it when he delivered his statement in the Commons earlier this month. Treasury ministers have been publicly cool on the idea. Sajid Javid said in a parliamentary answer recently: 'The Government keeps all options for tackling waste under review with any announcements on tax made at Budget. 'The Government continues to discuss with the retail sector the scale of carrier bag distribution and actions under way to reduce usage. 'Arrangements for compulsory charges on carrier bags in Scotland and Northern-Ireland, like in Wales, are a matter for the devolved administrations.' Junior environment minister Richard Benyon also suggested responsibility for reducing bag use lay with shoppers not minsters. 'The ability to take action also lies with consumers who can decline to accept them, in favour of reusable alternatives,' he said. Environment minister Richard Benyon said it was up to shoppers to use fewer bags . Official figures show around 350million more bags were given out by retailers over last year, despite David Cameron demanding ‘a drop. The PM warned in September 2011 that unless stores delivered ‘significant falls’ over the next 12 months, they could either be banned outright from giving out single-use bags or be legally required to charge customers for them. Instead the number rose by around five per cent to 6.75billion for 2011-12, but so far the government has refused to act. A Defra spokesman said: 'We want to work with retailers to help them lift their game to cut the number of bags they hand out.  We are monitoring the results of the charging scheme in Wales and the outcome of the Scottish consultation on a charge so that we can make a fully informed decision.' The Daily Mail’s Banish The Bags campaign has called upon companies and politicians to help reduce the number of single-use plastic bags. It has won the wide support of readers and charities, including the Marine Conservation Society, National Trust and Campaign to Protect Rural England. In October the Lib Dems rewrote party policy to demand a levy on plastic bags. Justine McGuinness, a former election candidate who also acted as a spokesman for or Kate and Gerry McCann's Find Madeleine Fund, said she used to be against the party’s policy on plastic bags but had changed her mind after visiting Ireland. ‘You don’t see plastic bags floating around in hedgerows because of course there is a plastic bag tax. 'It has changed people’s behaviour and that to me is a sign of a very good policy. It is a policy which will effect change.’","Bag use rose by around five per cent to 6.75billion in 2011-12 despite David Cameron demanding reductions .

Pictures and calendars featuring half-naked women will be stripped from U.S. Air Force work spaces and public areas under a widespread inspection to stamp out sexual assault in the armed forces. Commanders and supervisors in all active, reserve and Air National Guard units have 10 days to complete the sweep for pin-up images or materials reminiscent of the all-male military from 20 or 30 years ago. Air Force chief General Mark Welsh said having a culture where such objectification of women is tolerated may be contributing to reports of sexual assault increasing to more than 700 this year in the Air Force alone. Old-fashioned: Commanders in all active, reserve and Air National Guard units have 10 days to complete the sweep for pin-up images or materials reminiscent of the all-male military from 20 or 30 years ago (stock photo) 'You know, briefing slides that show a half-dressed woman for some reason,' Welsh told The Air Force Times. 'Inappropriate calendars on a wall, jokes being told at the beginning of a squadron meeting that are just off-color, and nobody appreciates them. 'It's the environmental stuff that has somebody going, ""Well I really didn't need to listen to that today."" ""I don't need to walk into the door to see that on the side of the guy's cubicle.""' Welsh said he has received multiple complaints about images, jokes and comments that made women and some men uncomfortable. The complaints suggest that many women in the Air Force feel they have to 'go along to get along' with offensive images and comments if they want to steer clear of trouble, Welsh told the newspaper. 'After talking to a number of our female officers... I believe that there is a potential that this is a problem in more than those isolated areas,' Welsh said. Complaints: Air Force chief Mark Welsh said he had received multiple complaints about images and jokes that had made women and some men feel uncomfortable . Culture: Having a culture in the Air Force where objectification of women is tolerated may be contributing to an increase in sexual assaults . 'Quite frankly, if we have 20 percent of our people who don't feel that they are fully respected and valued for all the incredible talents and the dedication they bring to the job, then that's just not the Air Force we want to be.' In the past, the Air Force regularly named its aircraft after women and the name was usually hand-painted on the side of the plane next to a scantily clad beauty. But this practice was stamped out more than 20 years ago, a spokesman told MailOnline, and none of the current fleet of aircraft features such images. General Welsh, however, is concerned that offensive images are continuing to objectify women in work spaces across the Air Force. He has focused on the need to stop sexual assaults and harassment in the workplace since coming to office in August. 'In my view, all this stuff is connected,' he said. 'If we're going to get serious about things like sexual assault, we have to get serious about an environment that could lead to sexual harassment. In some ways this stuff can all be linked. 'I'm not saying every case is linked, but it could be linked, and why would we want to tolerate there even being a chance of that?' Focus: Air Force General Mark Welsh, pictured, has focused on the need to stop sexual assaults and harassment in the workplace since coming to office in August . No more: Images such as these famous calendar pin-up of Marilyn Monroe on wall at Officer's club bar, in Thule Air Force base, will now be outlawed . In a letter to airmen last month, Air Force secretary Michael Donley said the force was bracing itself for 700 reports of sexual assault for 2012 - 100 more than last year. One shocking sexual assault scandal this year took place at basic training and involved almost two dozen military training instructors, of which 11 men have already been charged. 'Quite honestly, I'm not sure what we'll find,' Welsh told the Air Force Times. 'There might not be that many places where it's a problem; there might be a number of places where it's a problem. I don't know. That's part of my concern. That's why we’re not going to waste time trying to figure it out one place at a time.' He said they did not intend to conduct a 'witch hunt' and officers' personal computers and email accounts would not be searched. 'Nobody's going to be going through somebody's pockets in their coat in a locker or through their personal drawers,' he said. But Welsh added anything found in public areas would be construed as a violation of the law and dealt with accordingly.","All active, reserve and Air National Guard units have 10 days to complete the sweep for offensive images .

Death: Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was found hanging in her nurses' quarters at King Edward VII Hospital . ‘Nineteen years of togetherness with a . strong bond of affection and understanding will be cherished forever in . my life. Your loss is a very painful one and nobody can take that place . in my life ever again. I love you and miss you forever.’ Ms Saldanha's daughter Lisha, 14, . said: ‘We will miss your laughter, the loving memories and the good . times we had together. The house is an empty dwelling without your . presence. ‘We are shattered and there's an unfillable void in our lives. 'We . love you mum, sleep in peace and watch over us until me meet again in . heaven. We will always love you and keep you close to our heart.’ Her son Junal said: ‘Our mother, kind hearted, generous and a well-respected woman in both of our lives. You were the core of the family who kept is together. ‘In times of difficulty you showed us the way forward to happiness and success. Your priority for us was a good education and a bright future. You taught us right from wrong which we appreciate. ‘You worked tirelessly to give us everything that we have today. When we achieved good grades and merit, your pat on our backs encouraged us more.’ Standing outside the cathedral alongside . their local MP Charlotte Leslie and MP Keith Vaz, who has been . campaigning on behalf of the family, Mr Barboza said the family ‘could . not have foreseen the unprecedented tragedy that has unfolded in our . lives’. ‘The events of the last week have shattered our lives. We barely have the strength to withstand the grief and sorrow.’ He thanked the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prime Minister David Cameron for their condolences.

The family of a woman killed after she was electrocuted by a falling power line in front of her two young daughters has been awarded $109 million in damages. After a three week trial, jurors took 90 minutes to find Western Pennsylvania Power Co. negligent in the death of Carrie Goretzka, 39, who caught on fire then suffered for 20 minutes with the 7000 volt live wire on top of her. The victim's husband, Michael Goretzka, cried as the verdict was read and afterwards hugged and shook hands with each of the jurors, thanking them. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Negligent: Jurors found Western Pennsylvania Power Co. negligent in the death of Carrie Goretzka, 39, pictured centre with her husband, Michael, and daughters Chloe, left, and Carlie, right . According to The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Mr Goretzka had complained on two separate occasions that power lines had dropped into his backyard, even claiming he feared for his family's safety, before the deadly incident on June 2, 2009. On that day, Ms Goretzka was inside her Irwin, Allegheny County, home with daughters Chloe and Carlie, then aged four and two respectively, and her mother-in-law when the power went out. Looking outside, she noticed a number of trees in the yard were on fire and rushed to her car to grab her cell phone. As Ms Goretzka was standing on the side of the yard calling 911, the energised power line fell on top of her, setting her alight. Her mother-in-law, JoAnn Goretzka, tried to help but was burned. Backyard: It was the third time a live power line had fallen onto the Goretzka's property, pictured . Shocking: The mother-of-two was struck by the power line and set alight, leaving a sobering mark in the grass, pictured . She then waited for 20 agonising minutes with her granddaughters until emergency crews arrived and shut off the power. Ms Goretzka had several fingers . severed from her left hand and her left arm was ultimately amputated . before she died of her injuries in hospital three days later. Shanin Specter, who represented the family, said West Penn was responsible for an 'epidemic' of failures leading to the fallen energised line. He accused the company of continuously failing to fix the problem by retraining its workers, or disciplining them for sub-standard work. A company email from 2004 blamed poor preparation of the wires and improper splicing. The jury of eight women and four men said the hefty award handed to the family was intended to force the company to be accountable for its actions. 'We just wanted to send a message that not applying safe practices across the board is not acceptable,' said jury member Thomas Swogger told The Post-Gazette. Gracious: Michael Goretzka, pictured, is 'gracious' after the $109 million award . Hugs: Mr Goretzka, pictured, hugs and shook hands with each of the jurors outside the courtroom on Thursday . Mr Swogger said the fact power lines had fallen in the Goretzkas' yard twice previously was a significant issue for the jury. 'As a matter of public safety, the Goretzkas are representative of any one of us. It could have been anyone,' he said. Another, unnamed juror, told WTAE News: . 'Its been a very emotional experience through this whole trial and we . just wanted to do right by the family and somehow ease their pain and . suffering a little bit.' West Penn Power said it may appeal Thursday's verdict. 'We'll be reviewing the verdict during the next several days to determine whether an appeal of any or all of the verdict is warranted,' a spokesman told CBS News. Mr Shecter told the TV station: 'The family was very gratified by the verdict but nothing can bring back Carrie Goretzka she was a beautiful 39-year-old mother, wife and daughter. Tragic: Ms Goreztka, pictured with her husband and children, was calling 911 when the live wire fell on her . 'She suffered for 45 minutes from electrocution, 20 minutes of which the line was live, 7000 volts lying on top of her body. 'That is just unspeakably horrendous, her daughters witnesses this right in front of their eyes, her mother-in-law tried to save her and was herself burned. 'The jury's verdict is an important message to First Energy (the parent company of West Penn Power) that they have to fix their power lines in Western Pennsylvania. They have had a problem, it's really been an epidemic, of falling energized power lines.' The judgment includes $61 million in punitive damages against West Penn Power. Judge Michael Della Vecchia said the $109 million judgment is the largest personal injury verdict ever awarded in Allegheny County.","Carrie Goretzka, 39, was killed in June 2009 when a power line fell on her .

"By . Nick Pisa . UPDATED: . 12:26 EST, 4 August 2011 . With his country facing ruin, Berlusconi might have been able to take his attention from women for just a short while. But it seems that even in parliament, the 74-year-old tycoon-turned-prime minister can't resist being a ladies' man. Berlusconi was pictured smiling broadly as he flirted with the attractive member of parliament Michaela Biancofiore yesterday. Flirting: Michaela Biancofiore playfully squeezes Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's chin at the Parliament in Rome yesterday . Tender: Close friend Ms Biancofiore, 40, gently lays her hand across Berlusconi's chest moments before his speech on the country's economy . Blonde Ms Biancofiore, 40, gently placed her hand on Berlusconi's chest as she leaned in closely to whisper into his ear words of encouragement. As Berlusconi began to giggle, the Italian foreign office minister tenderly squeezed his chin. Ms Biancofiore, a member of Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party, has been a long term friend of the flamboyant prime minister. Last year she was on hand to comfort him after he was hit in the face with a metal and plaster statue of Milan's Gothic Cathedral in January 2010. Berlusconi attended her 40th birthday shortly afterwards and seemed very amused when he presented him with a cake showing a picture of the pair of them on the campaign trail. Ms Biancofiore is one of a coterie of extremely attractive female MPs who Berlusconi has promoted, giving them plum positions in the Italian parliament. In an interview, she claimed that he had 'nurtured her politically.' It's not the first time Italy's leader has been caught enjoying female attention during stuffy Parliamentary debates. In June the renowned ladies' man was pictured having an intimate chat with Tourism Minister Michela Vittoria Brambilla. Flashback: In June Mr Berlusconi enjoyed an intimate chat with Tourism Minister Michela Vittoria Brambilla . While the lower chamber of deputies discussed crucial finance issues, Ms Brambilla sidled over to Mr Berlusconi and began whispering something in his ear. The pair held hands during their hushed conversation, which left them both smiling. Yesterday's romantic exchanges came as Berlusconi told parliament that Italy needed an 'immediate action plan' to relaunch growth amid concerns of a debt crisis. Italy - which is the third largest economy in the Eurozone is facing a financial meltdown much the same as its neighbours across the Mediterranean Greece. But even during the economic crisis the prime minister has reportedly hosted more of his infamous bunga bunga parties. Thrilled: Berlusconi is delighted with the attention from blonde Ms Biancofiore . According to Italian media reports 20 women were seen entering Berlusconi's villa at Arcore last Sunday in a fleet of cars with guests not leaving until 2am. The women are said to have 'used more caution' than normal when entering the villa so as not to attract attention although the identity of the women was not known. Berlusconi, 74, is embroiled in allegations that dozens of showgirls were paid to attend the bunga bunga parties - which is said to refer to a crude after dinner sex act - at his luxury villa. He is currently facing a charge of of having sex with an underage prostitute after it emerged one of the guests at the parties held last year was at the time just 17 years old. The new allegations of sex parties came as Berlusconi today tried to reassure Italians 'there was nothing to be worried about' as the country's stock market continued to plunge. Berlusconi, spoke out at a press conference following a crucial meeting between the government, employers' associations and unions in a bid to stop Italy from spiralling towards a Greek style debt crisis. The meeting took place a day after the media tycoon turned politician had given a speech to parliament to calm fears that the country was heading for default. Speaking at a press conference in Rome after the meeting he said: 'I want to tell the Italians there is nothing to worry about. Don't be frightened off the markets, keep your share certificates in your drawers. 'My speech of yesterday was not towards the stock exchange but to Italians, I wanted to reassure them and tell them not to sell their stocks if they have investments.' However as he spoke the Milan stock exchange - despite a jump of 1.81 per cent when it first started trading, slumped 300 points or just over 1 per cent in the time that he spoke. Binga bunga girls: Berlusconi is facing charges that he paid to hav sex with Moroccan belly dancer Karima el Mahroug when she was 17 . Berlusconi, who had failed to convince economists, newspapers and opposition politicians tried to remain upbeat - even after he was accused of lacking 'punch' in giving his speech. He said: 'I don't think the crisis will get any worse - we should not allow ourselves to be frightened by the spreads because interest rate rises are only a fraction of the relative costs. 'The markets are only reacting to what the papers are saying but the markets are reacting for their very own different reasons and politics is not one of them.' Bank clerk's son Berlusconi then added: 'I am the son of a father who had a long experience on the stock exchange and he said markets were like a broken watch - twice a day they give the right time the rest of the time they are wrong.' Berlusconi spoke after the country's bond markets slumped, causing its borrowing rates to touch a record high on Wednesday but he stressed Italy could still over come the crisis despite question marks. Women: Prostitute Nadia Macri, left, claims that she took part in drug-fuelled sex parties with Berlusconi, while underwear model Noemi Letizia, 18, entertained the prime minister at her birthday party . He added Italy and its economy were solid and that markets and speculators were to blame and the meeting was to agree a six-point plan to rescue the economy. These included balancing the budget by 2014, reduce the cost of government, increase deregulation and privatization, unblock investments, cut red tape simplify government administration and act to boost the labour market. However Berlusconi's hopes were not met by economic experts - Michele Boldrin, an lecturer at the University of Washington, said: 'Only a strong government can calm the markets. 'He insists that the markets are wrong and that his government has done its duty - well in that case either the markets are run by imbeciles or we can see who is really to blame from their reaction.' Italy's national debt is currently running at 120 per cent of GDP at a trillion pounds - and last month an austerity package of 80 billion Euros worth of cuts was introduced. Berlusconi also insisted that cuts would be made to MPs salaries and perks - Italian politicians are amongst the highest paid in Europe with a salary of around 19,000 Euro a month. According to employers and unions, belt-tightening measures now needed to be accompanied by creating the conditions for economic growth and Berlusconi said his government would create jobs with new infrastructure projects. Despite urging from employers and unions for immediate or at least swift action, the government said it intended to present measures in the first weeks of September. This was greeted with disbelief by some union representatives who said that given the seriousness of the situation the country should not wait six weeks until after MPs returned from their summer holidays. Opposition parties also remained unconvinced by Berlusconi - who is currently involved in four trials - and repeated calls for him to resign immediately. Leoluca Orlando from the anti sleaze Italy of Values party, said: 'The European central bank is dismissing his hypocrtical optimism. While he tells the world everything is OK, (Jean Claude) Trichet says differently. 'Everyone knows that Berlusconi tells lies on a massive scale and the markets know that his government is not to be trusted and is not solid - he should do something truly patriotic and resign before Italy sinks with him.'","Italian prime minister shrugs off financial crisis as Michaela Biancofiore squeezes his chin .

A woman who lost control of her SUV on an ice-covered road and drove it into a frigid lake with her five-year-old daughter in the vehicle was rescued by a brave stranger. Carrie Mattingly and her daughter Ava had climbed out the driver’s side window of the SUV as it was slowly sinking into the lake when Jeff Oliver and several co-workers were driving by. Oliver ran to the shore, took off his work boots off and dove into the lake. Scroll down for video . Scary moment: Carrie Mattingly, 43, lost control of her SUV on an ice-covered road and drove it into a frigid lake with her five-year-old daughter Ava in the vehicle . 'Stay calm': 'I just kept telling my daughter to stay calm, we are going to be okay, and we are calm,' said Mattingly . Worried for her daughter: 'I can not get images out of my mind already, I just do not know what it is going to be like for her,' said Mattingly about her 5-year-old daughter Ava . He got about half way, but the water was too cold, he said. He swam back to where he could touch the bottom of the lake and then went back again for Mattingly and her daughter. As Oliver swam out to the car, other people in the area jumped into the freezing lake to help out. Oliver was finally able to make it out to rescue little Ava. ‘I was able to swim and grab her hand and pull her towards me and swim a little more and pull her along until we got to the shore where there were multiple people there that were able to help,’ he told Fox59 in Indianapolis. Just in time: Mattingly and Ava had climbed out the driver¿s side window of the SUV as it was slowly sinking into the lake when stranger Jeff Oliver and several co-workers were driving by . The people in the water made a human-chain and passed the 5-year-old along to the bank. ‘I don’t know what it takes, I just know you cannot sit there and watch someone die,’ said Oliver. ‘You have got to try and help as much as you can.’ After her daughter made it to land safely, Mattingly started to swim towards the bank. Oliver ended up in the same ambulance as Carrie and Ava Mattingly. It turned out after the brave effort to save two strangers in need of help that Oliver actually knew Mattingly’s husband. He had never met her before that day. ‘The fact that it was a friend of my husband’s,’ said Mattingly. ‘How does that happen?’ The 43-year-old mother suffered minor bruises when her car went into the lake. Her daughter was unharmed. Mattingly told Fox59 that the incident has changed her forever and has given her a new appreciation for her family and life in general. ‘That is all I can think about right now, how did we survive that? How did that happen?  Thank God we did and wow, I need to make it to church every Sunday,’ she said. It was believed at first that Mattingly and her daughter were in water 60 to 80 feet deep, according to WIBC, but the depth has since been determined to have been only about to ten to 15 feet.

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 12:13 EST, 19 January 2012 . Leading figures in the LA porn industry say they'll start packing up their sex toys and abandoning the U.S. porn capital if authorities carry through with an effort to police film sets and order that every actor wear a condom. That move took step closer to becoming reality on Tuesday when the Los Angeles city council voted 9-1 to grant final approval to an ordinance that would deny film permits to producers who do not comply with the condom requirement. The measure now goes to Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for approval. A man aims his video camera at an exotic dancer at the Erotica LA 2002 adult industry tradeshow in Los Angeles, California . Before the measure can take effect, . the council has called for the creation of a committee to determine how . it might be enforced. 'It's . going to be interesting to see how in fact they do try to enforce it . and who's going to fund it, and all of the time and effort they're going . to spend,' said Steven Hirsch, co-founder and co-chairman of Los . Angeles-based Vivid, one of the largest makers of erotic movies. 'Ultimately I think what they will . find is people will just stop shooting in the city of Los Angeles,' added Hirsch. 'That's a given.' His company would be among those that would consider leaving, he said. Approximately . 90 per cent of U.S. porn films are made in Los Angeles, almost all of . them in the city's San Fernando Valley, said Mark Kernes, senior editor . of Adult Video News. Ban: The city's move could mean actors have to wear condoms on set . When films, Internet downloads, sex . toys and admission to dance clubs are counted, Kernes said, it's an . industry that produces about $8 billion a year in revenue. It has been battered in recent years, however, by the recession and the increased popularity of free Internet porn. Kernes and others say requiring condoms would further erode business. They . say consumers, particularly those overseas, have made it clear they . won't watch films when the actors use condoms, complaining that it is . distracting and ruins the fantasy. Los Angeles Mayor: Antonio Villaraigosa will have to give final approval to the measure enforcing condoms which could see the LA porn industry dwindle . 'The . only thing that the city could potentially achieve is losing some film . permit money and driving some productions away, but you can't actually . compel an industry to create a product that the market doesn't want,' said Christian Mann, general manager of Evil Angel, another of the . industry's largest production companies. Ged . Kenslea, spokesman for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, said the measure . is needed because the industry has failed to properly police itself. For years, he said, filmmakers have . ignored state health laws mandating the use of condoms when workers are . exposed to blood-borne pathogens. 'Let's . make one thing clear: Condom use on adult film sets is, and has been, . the law in California under blood-borne pathogens regulations,' he said. 'It is just a law that has not been uniformly enforced or followed. 'This . film permit ordinance that the city council approved today provides . another enforcement mechanism to make sure that adult film producers are . complying with existing California law.' Relocate: Porn vendors are threatening to leave LA if the condom rules and policing of film sets are enforced . The council's final vote to approve the law was taken without public discussion, on a day when most of the porn industry's major players were in Las Vegas preparing for Wednesday's opening of the Adult Entertainment Expo, their industry's largest trade event. The industry already does its own policing, filmmakers say, requiring actors be tested for sexually transmitted diseases a minimum of every 30 days when they are working. They say no cases of HIV have been directly linked to porn films since 2004, adding they fear if the industry scatters to areas outside of Los Angeles, testing could fall by the wayside, exposing performers to more risk. 'If someone is going to catch an STD, it's usually out of the business because we are tested so often,' said veteran porn actress and producer Tabitha Stevens. In her 17 years in the business, Stevens said, she has worked both with and without condoms. Although she prefers to use condoms, acknowledging they do increase safety, she said the choice should be left up to the performers and not mandated by a government agency. 'If you want to wear them, wear them. If you don't, don't. That's up to the talent to decide. It shouldn't be up to the government to decide,' she said.","Approximately .

Scotland Yard boss Bernard Hogan-Howe was fighting for his credibility last night as senior Tories said he was ‘completely compromised’ by the police ‘stitch-up’ of Andrew Mitchell. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner flew home from holiday amid claims that he blindly accepted the word of officers in Downing Street who said the former Tory chief whip called them ‘plebs’. Mr Hogan-Howe was even branded ‘extremely foolish’ by a former director of public prosecutions. Last month the commissioner – who is expected to be given a knighthood in the Queen’s New Year’s Honours – said the officers had ‘accurately reported what happened’. Authority: Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe has been dragged into the 'Plebgate' row . Mr Mitchell, as he accepts, was wrong to have set such a bad example by swearing at the police . But last night he was forced to issue . a statement insisting that he would preside over a ‘ruthless search for . the truth’ about the ‘Plebgate’ confrontation that led to Mr Mitchell’s . resignation. A policeman involved in the Downing Street fracas was named yesterday in the Mail on Sunday as Toby Rowland. He is the officer believed to have written the official log of the incident. Another . policeman, diplomatic protection officer Keith Wallis, 52, and a man . believed to be his 23-year-old nephew Clarence Ng have been arrested . amid allegations that the officer posed as a member of the public in . order to fabricate evidence against Mr Mitchell. CCTV . footage has also emerged which undermines the claims of the two . officers at the gate that members of the public were ‘visibly shocked’ by the confrontation last September. A . friend of Mr Mitchell, senior Tory MP David Davis, warned that unless . the police answer key questions about the conspiracy they will demand . that the Independent Police Complaints Commission takes the inquiry out . of the Met’s hands. Allies of Mr Mitchell are furious that . Mr Hogan-Howe last week claimed the CCTV did ‘nothing’ to challenge the . claims of his officers. Former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald said the Met boss was ‘extremely foolish’ and accused him of ‘an arrogance of power’. ‘What exactly does Bernard Hogan-Howe consider is the purpose of having an inquiry into the men he has already exonerated on television?’ he asked. A chastened commissioner said: ‘The allegations in relation to this case are extremely serious.

An elderly baroness whose former gardener claimed he was left deaf by years spent mowing grass on her country estate has successfully fought off his legal battle for £25,000 compensation. Clifford Sayers, 66, claimed he was deafened by the din of his power tools while tending to the East Sussex estate, home to Pia, Lady Chelwood, widow of Military Cross holder and former Tory MP Tufton Beamish. Mr Sayers, who looked after the grounds of the £700,000 home for almost 20 years after being hired by Lord Chelwood, had launched legal action seeking damages for ‘noise induced deafness’. Joy: Baroness Lady Chelwood pictured on her wedding Day with her husband Conservative MP Tufton Beamish in 1975. She has won a legal battle with her former gardener over claims his work damaged his hearing . He claimed his intrusive tinnitus resulted from years of using lawn mowers, chainsaws, strimmers and other power tools in his job and that the noise prevented him from watching TV and made normal conversation with his wife impossible. However, his case, finally hit the buffers yesterday as three top judges at the Court of Appeal ruled that he had left it too late to sue and that Lady Chelwood would not have a fair chance of defending herself due to the delay. The case had initially been thrown out by a county court judge last year on the same grounds. Last night the 90-year-old widow, who said she had felt betrayed by the noise claim, welcomed the ruling saying that 'justice has been done'. Mr Sayers claimed his tinnitus resulted from years of using lawn mowers, chainsaws, strimmers and other power tools. File picture . She said: ‘The court has, for the second time, thrown out this frivolous case. Justice has been done.’ ‘I’m very pleased but I always knew what the outcome would be - I knew he would never win. The whole thing was farcical. ‘I feel nothing for that man, and now I never have to think about him again.’ Lord Justice Jackson, sitting with Lady Justice Arden and Lord Justice Kitchin, said the legal deadline for launching personal injury compensation cases had expired four years before Mr Sayers lodged his claim in July 2008 and it would not be fair on Lady Chelwood to extend that time limit. Lord Chelwood, formerly Colonel Sir Tufton Victor Hamilton Beamish, took on Mr Sayers as a gardener and forester in 1981 to look after the grounds of his country home, set in the East Sussex countryside above the South Downs. Lord Chelwood - long satirised by Private Eye as Sir Bufton-Tufton - was a staunch champion of the countryside and a keen ornithologist. The court heard Mr Sayers worked for him until his death in 1989 aged 72, and then for Austrian born Pia. He lived in a lodge on the estate until he left her employment in 2000. Ruling: Three top judges at the High Court decided that the case would not go ahead, the second court to do so . His duties also included tending pheasants and feeding the ponies. But it was using the mechanical tools, Mr Sayers alleges, that caused the ‘intrusive’ ringing in his ears. He claims he had a 45 per cent reduction in his overall hearing and suffered from what was described as ‘an irreparable industrial disease’. However, he was told in 2005 that his hearing loss could be age-related. Arguing that a county court judge had been wrong to strike out Mr Sayers’ claim, his barrister, Simon Mallett, insisted that too much account had been taken for Lady Chelwood’s advanced age and the problems she might face in giving evidence. However, dismissing the appeal, Lord Justice Jackson said that, apart from memory having failed with time, crucial insurance documents had been mislaid and Lady Chelwood’s defence to her former gardener’s claim would be unfairly prejudiced by the delay. Last night Mr Sayers who lives in Crowborough, East Sussex, said that he was 'disappointed' with the ruling.","Clifford Sayers claims his hearing was ravaged by his years as a gardener for Lady Chelwood .

But all those lawnmowers, strimmers and chainsaws took their toll on Clifford Sayers, it was claimed yesterday. The 65-year-old gardener believes he was deafened by the din from the power tools. And now he is suing the 90-year-old baroness who employed him. Battle: Baroness Chelwood (left) is being sued by Clifford Sayers - the former gardener taken on by her late husband Tufton Beamish (right) In a £25,000 compensation battle, Mr Sayers is seeking damages for ‘noise induced deafness’ he says he suffered while looking after the East Sussex estate, home to Pia, Lady Chelwood, widow of Military Cross holder and former Tory MP Tufton Beamish. Yesterday a court heard that when he complained to her about the ringing in his ears ‘her response was that she would get similar symptoms when loading her husband’s guns’. The case of the gardener, the war hero and the baroness emerged at the Appeal Court in London as lawyers argued over whether Mr Sayers had been denied a full hearing of his claim, which the baroness is contesting. Speaking to the Daily Mail last night, widowed Lady Chelwood said she felt betrayed by her former gardener. She said: ‘I’m furious that he has repaid our generosity and kindness with this legal action.‘He came to us in 1981. He was a truck driver and answered my husband’s advertisement for a gardener in the local paper. ‘He knew nothing about gardening but my husband was very kind to him, helped him to learn and we gave him the lodge for him and his sick wife to live in. ‘We paid for all his utility bills, heating, expenses, and a good wage. We looked after him and his family. ‘But when my husband died in 1989 I expected him to look after me and he did nothing. He was terribly lazy and never did the work properly, or weeded my vegetable garden when it was too much for me.’ Lady Chelwood said that after Mr Sayers’ wife died she asked him to leave the lodge. She added: ‘He was totally physically fit, with no hearing problems, when he left here in 2000, and I gave him three months’ notice pay and a six thousand pounds redundancy. ‘I feel so betrayed. This case has been thrown out so many times now it’s ridiculous.’ Celebrated: War hero and MP Tufton Beamish (far left) pictured with friends at the 1968 House of Lords shooting match - he hired the gardener now suing his wife . Claim: Clifford Sayers, 65, wants damages for 'noise-induced deafness' from Baroness Chelwood, caused by cutting her lawn, the High Court heard . Lady Chelwood added that ear protectors, as well as protective clothing, boots and waterproofs were provided for Mr Sayers by her and her husband. Baron Chelwood, formerly Colonel Sir Tufton Victor Hamilton Beamish, took on Mr Sayers as a gardener and forester in 1981. The outspoken backbencher, wounded during glittering war service at Dunkirk and in Italy, stepped down as MP for Lewes and retired from politics in 1974, when he was made a life peer. Although he listed gardening among his hobbies, he needed someone to look after the grounds of his country home, set in the East Sussex countryside above the South Downs.

Fabrice Muamba's life-threatening cardiac arrest in the middle of an FA cup quarter-final match has helped save the life of another player. Muamba, 24, collapsed in front of millions of screaming fans in March and his heart stopped beating naturally for 78 minutes during the match between Bolton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur . Now, prompted by the ex-Bolton player's heart attack, another young footballer has undergone major heart surgery as a result of a routine scan. Burnley defender Jack Errington, 17, was found to have an enlarged aorta which could have killed him. Burnley FC's Jack Errington (left, with Alan Shearer) was told an enlarged aorta could have killed him . Former England star Alan Shearer, who was visiting the hospital said: 'It's an incredible . story as he was just tested after what happened to Fabrice Muamba. He . actually said to me when they gave him his results he thought they were . joking. 'It shows that a little good has come out of Muamba's . situation, which was unfortunate for Fabrice but in a way he's helped . someone else. Hidden heart defects among the young are not uncommon, according to the charity Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY). Fabrice Muamba shocked the nation when he dramatically collapsed in March . Dr Steve Cox, . director of screening at the charity, says: . 'This is just another example of the importance of screening young . people (aged 35 and under) for underlying cardiac conditions.' 'The CRY . Screening programme currently tests around 10,000 young people every . year in the UK. Of those, one in every 300 will be identified with a . potentially life-threatening condition.' 'Every week in the UK, 12 apparently fit and healthy young people, under . the age of 35, die from undiagnosed cardiac conditions.' '80 per cent of these deaths will occur with no prior symptoms, which . means that there are many young people who will be simply unaware that . they are quite literally living with a ‘ticking time-bomb’. 'CRY wants all young people to be aware of the importance of cardiac screening and to have the opportunity to be tested,' he said. Many underlying heart problems are due to an inherited condition rather than a general lack of fitness. Indeed sport stars may be at greater risk because intense activity can . significantly increase a person's risk of heart attack if they have a . heart abnormality. Research has suggested people are twice as likely to suffer a cardiac arrest if they play sport at a high level. While the first symptom of a cardiac condition is often sudden death, fainting regularly or a family history of unexplained deaths are both symptoms to look out for. Sudden death in younger people is usually from inherited heart . conditions. The most common of these is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy . (HCM), which is when the heart muscle becomes excessively thick, . making the heart vulnerable to dangerous and potentially fatal heart . rhythms. Other disorders of the heart include myocarditis, which causes . inflammation of the heart muscle and Long QT syndrome, which affects the . sodium, potassium and calcium channels in the heart needed to control . the electric current in the cells. Most heart abnormalities can be diagnosed with an an electrocardiogram, . which looks at the electrical conduction pathways around the heart. This test is painless, non-invasive and takes a few minutes to perform. It can be confirmed with an an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart.)

'I escaped, was captured and they tried to send me back. Now I'm sitting in Miami. There had to be some ineptness. 'What's a better story, millionaire mad man on the run. [The media] saved my ass. Because you paid attention to the story. As long as you are reporting, it is hard to whack somebody that the world is watching.' When McAfee's plane landed at Miami International Airport last night, he was without a travel companion - his 20-year-old girlfriend Samantha Vanegas, who he left in Guatemala. After landing, McAfee, 67, was escorted from the plane by airport security officers, and he quickly checked into a hotel in the exclusive South Beach area. 'Some people felt uncomfortable that he . was on our flight. ... We all knew the story,' said Maria Claridge, 36, a .

Brooklyn's very own Santa Claus is doing his best to bring Christmas cheer to hundreds of children affected by Hurricane Sandy. Dressed up in a bushy white beard and red suit and carrying a sack full of toys, Michael Sciaraffo could easily be mistaken for the real Father Christmas as he delivers gifts in storm-ravaged neighbourhoods. Every afternoon and night he stuffs his red sack to the brim with presents and heads out to personally deliver them to children who faced a Christmas without presents after they were washed away during the hurricane. Scroll down for video: . Christmas cheer: Michael Sciaraffo stuffs his sack full of gifts as he prepares to deliver them to children affected by Hurricane Sandy . Hope: Mr Sciaraffo says collecting and delivering presents in storm-ravaged neighbourhoods is like a full-time job . Delivery: He arrives with a sack of Christmas gifts at a family home in the Belle Harbor neighborhood of the Queens borough of New York . Thanks: John Taylor, far left, his sons Nicholas, 5, second from left, and Johnny, 9, second from right, and their neighbour Liam Siederman, 10, centre, watch as Mr Sciaraffo continues with his deliveries . And with less than a week before Christmas, his 'Secret Sandy Claus Project' is keeping him very busy. He hopes to deliver gifts to around 1,000 children during the next few days. 'Between the requests coming in for personal visits as well as the influx of donations, it's been a full time job,' said Mr Sciaraffo, a 31-year-old political consultant. 'And kudos to Santa, because I don't know how he pulls it off every year.' Respect: Mr Sciaraffo, a business consultant, has credited the real Santa Claus for his hard work at Christmas after gaining his own first-hand experience of delivering presents . Boxes of toys are piled on tables and all over the floor of Mr Sciaraffo's apartment where he spends most of the day updating his list of toy requests and donations, which are pouring in. He initially began jotting down the . requests on Post-it notes, but as demand steadily grew he created a . spreadsheet and taped it to the wall. 'The . goal was to match up each child with a toy that they liked or asked . Santa for, for Christmas,' he explained. 'We basically tried to pair them . up with toys I had in stock.' The . charitable enterprise grew out of a Sandy donation outreach effort that . Mr Sciaraffo had been spearheading for weeks in the wake of the storm, . drumming up donations of clothing and food through Facebook. As the holidays approached, he realised that lots of children would be without their toys this year - and . with their parents preoccupied with the drudgery of storm repairs, many . children probably would not even get to sit on Santa's lap. So he . decided to fill that gap himself. 'When I was a kid, my toys were very . important to me,' Mr Sciaraffo said. 'That's their security blanket, so . to speak. I couldn't sit home and do nothing.' Donations . are coming in by the truckload from all over the country and Mr Sciaraffo . has received help from fellow New Yorkers like Sean Turk, a . father of three from Queens who has raised more than $2,000 from his . community and has been filling toy requests at local stores. 'I started it with $500 of my own,' Mr Turk said, 'and then people just started contributing.' Joy: Hurricane Sandy hit soon after little Ella's first birthday and destroyed her toys. Here she receives a gift from Mr Sciaraffo (with her mother Elizabeth Sampol) Happy: Another youngster receives a present. Mr Sciaraffo's Brooklyn apartment is now stuffed with donated gifts . Donations: More gifts are delivered to Mr Sciaraffo for children affected by the hurricane after his Secret Sandy Claus Project caught the public's imagination . On a recent rainy afternoon, Mr Sciaraffo pulled on his white wig and beard and drove out to weather-beaten Belle Harbor, a town on the Rockaway peninsula. The first stop: the darkened oceanfront home of Elizabeth Sampol, who was waiting upstairs with her daughter, Ella. Little Ella gazed up as Mr Sciaraffo . handed her a toy duck. Sandy struck just after her first birthday . party, destroying all of her toys when the basement flooded. 'As . you can see from the outside of the house and the inside of the house, . it's been a disaster,' said Elizabeth Sampol, who has been living in a .

Police believe they have found her body in bushes . The body of a 10-year-old Las Vegas girl who was last seen with a blackjack dealer accused of slashing her colleague has been found in an undeveloped housing area, police believe. Jade Morris has been missing for a week after family friend Brenda Stokes offered to take her Christmas shopping. The pair never returned. That night Stokes allegedly slashed a co-worker in the face with razor blad at the famed Bellagio resort on the Las Vegas strip. Authorities couldn't immediately confirm that the body found on Thursday belonged to Jade Morris, Las Vegas police homicide Capt. Chris Jones said. 'I can tell you that the likelihood is that this is our victim,' he said. He added that the body belongs to a black girl, and Jade was black. Coroner Michael Murphy said he expected to make a positive identification Friday. Stokes is also due to appear in court today on charges relating to the casino attack. Jade's family last saw her at about 5pm on December 21, when Stokes picked her up for a shopping outing, police said. Police said Stokes was a trusted friend of the girl's father, and family members have told reporters that the two dated for several years. Stokes, who also uses the name Brenda Wilson, was arrested later that night after she was accused of slashing her co-worker. Stokes, 50, is now in jail, and Capt. Jones said she has not cooperated in the investigation of the girl's whereabouts. She even denied collecting the girl from her home. A passer-by called 911 about noon Thursday, and North Las Vegas police found a girl's body in brush near palm trees in a small traffic circle near Dorrell Lane and North Fifth Street. Blackjack dealer Brenda Stokes, 50, was arrested for allegedly slashing a colleagues the same night Jade went missing . The location is a short distance from the northern 215 Beltway and about 10 miles from the downtown Las Vegas outlet mall off Interstate 15 where Stokes was to have taken the girl shopping. Attempts to reach family members have been unsuccessful. Stokes had picked up the girl to take her shopping and two hours later returned to another friend the red 2007 Saab sedan that she borrowed for the trip, Capt Jones said. Later, Stokes got a lift with a friend to the luxury hotel famed for its elaborate fountain displays, where she was arrested after authorities say she attacked a female co-worker, Joyce Rhone, with a razor in each hand as Rhone dealt blackjack about 9:30 p.m. Rhone, 44, was hospitalised with deep cuts on her face, including one from her ear to the edge of her mouth. A police arrest report said Rhone also had several smaller cuts around her right eye. Records show that Stokes was being held on $60,000 bail at the Clark County jail on felony battery with a weapon, burglary and mayhem charges that could get her decades in prison. She told a judge Wednesday that she had not obtained a lawyer. She was due again in Las Vegas Justice Court on Friday morning. The arrest report says casino video shows Stokes attacking Rhone before a casino patron and security officers intervene. Officer Marcus Martin said the video is evidence that may be shown by prosecutors in court but will not be made public by police. Police said Stokes later told investigators that she attacked Rhone over harassing phone calls and an unspecified betrayal that ended their seven-year friendship. The slashing attack is said to have happened at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas strip. The luxury hotel is famed for its elaborate fountain displays, pictured . Stokes also told police she visited her doctor last week, seeking to be admitted to a hospital 'due to feeling like she wanted to hurt someone'. When the family heard that Stokes had been arrested in a vicious knife attack on a fellow card dealer on the casino floor of the Bellagio, they grew concerned for their daughter's well-being. The girl's father, Philip Morris, who is reportedly engaged to Stokes, had said just days ago he was sure Jade was still alive. It is unknown how many of the Bellagio's 4,000 guests saw the fight, which occurred in the crowded casino at around 9.45pm, but it came just a week after many witnessed a murder-suicide in a busy hotel lobby on the Las Vegas strip.","Jade Morris was last seen on December 21 with Brenda Stokes .

An American tourist has been arrested in North Korea but the secretive regime is refusing the reveal his 'crime'. State-run Korean Central News Agency today identified the detainee as Pae Jun Ho in a brief dispatch. His arrest comes at a time when Pyongyang is facing criticism from Washington for launching a long-range rocket last week. Secretive: North Korea leader Kim Jong Un with his country's soldiers . News reports in the U.S. and South Korea said Pae is known in his home state of Washington as Kenneth Bae, a 44-year-old tour operator of Korean descent. An expert said he is likely to become a bargaining chip for the North, an attempt to draw the U.S. into talks. Five other Americans known to have been detained in North Korea since 2009 were all eventually released. North Korean state media said Pae arrived in the far northeastern city of Rajin on November 3 as part of a tour. Rajin is part of a special economic zone not far from Yanji, China, that has sought to draw foreign investors and tourists over the past year. Yanji, home to many ethnic Korean Chinese, also serves as a base for Christian groups that shelter North Korean defectors. 'In the process of investigation, evidence proving that he committed a crime against (North Korea) was revealed. He admitted his crime,' the KCNA dispatch said. The North said the crimes were 'proven through evidence' but did not elaborate. Unease: North Korea launched the Unha-3 long-range rocket last week . KCNA said consular officials from the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang visited Pae on Friday. Sweden represents the United States in diplomatic affairs in North Korea since Washington and Pyongyang do not have diplomatic relations. Karl-Olof Andersson, Sweden's ambassador to North Korea, told The Associated Press he could not comment on the case and referred the matter to the U.S. State Department. The State Department was not immediately able to provide any additional information about the report. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said on Dec. 11 that Washington was 'obviously aware' of reports that a U.S. citizen was detained in North Korea. She didn't confirm the reports. In Seoul, the Segye Ilbo newspaper . reported last week that Bae had been taking tourists on a five-day trip . to the North when he was arrested. The newspaper cited unidentified . sources. Home: American journalists Laura Ling, top right, and Euna Lee were freed from North Korea in 2009 following a visit to the country by U.S. president Bill Clinton . News of the arrest comes as North Korea is celebrating the launch of a satellite into space on December 12, in defiance of calls by the U.S. and others to cancel a liftoff widely seen as an illicit test of ballistic missile technology. The announcement of the American's detainment could be a signal from the North that it wants dialogue with the United States, said Cheong Seong-chang, an analyst at the private Sejong Institute in South Korea. He said trips by former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter to North Korea to secure the release of other detained Americans created a mood for U.S.-North Korea talks. 'North Korea knows sanctions will follow its rocket launch. But in the long run, it needs an excuse to reopen talks after the political atmosphere moves past sanctions,' Cheong said. Cheong said he expects that the American will be tried and convicted in coming months. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has the power to grant amnesty and will exercise it as a bargaining chip, Cheong said. Nuland said earlier this week that Washington had been trying to reach out to Kim. Rally: North Korean soldiers, officials and people celebrate nuclear testing . 'Instead, that was met not only with an abrogation of agreements that had been made by the previous North Korean regime, but by missile activity both in April and in December,' she told reporters. She said Washington had no choice but to put pressure on Pyongyang, and was discussing with its allies how to 'further isolate' the regime. In April 2009, a North Korean rocket launch took place while two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, were in North Korean custody after allegedly trying to sneak into the country across the Tumen River dividing the North from China. They were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor before being released on humanitarian grounds after Clinton flew to Pyongyang to negotiate their release. Subsequently, three other Americans were arrested and eventually released by North Korea. All three are believed to have been accused of illegally spreading Christianity. North Korea has several sanctioned churches in Pyongyang but frowns on the distribution of Bibles and other religious materials by foreigners. Interaction between North Koreans and foreigners is strictly regulated.","State media identify detainee as Pae Jun Ho .

Bulgaria has invited French tax exiles Gerard Depardieu and Bernard Arnault to become Bulgarian citizens with the promise of 'cheap alcohol, concrete beach resorts and experienced prostitutes'. The cheeky letter from Bulgaria's Demographic Policy Centre was sent to the famous film star and France's richest man as a protest against the mass emigration from the cash-strapped eastern European state. Depardieu, 64, and Arnault, 63, both recently announced they were fleeing to Belgium to dodge France's new massive tax hike on the rich of 75 per cent on all earnings over one million euros. Scroll down for video . Shocked: French actor Gerard Depardieu received a surprising letter from a Bulgarian policy centre encouraging him to relocate to the country for tax reasons, among others . The invitation from policy centre chief Iskren Veselinov reads: 'Bulgaria is an exceptionally beautiful country inhabited by smart, industrious, and good-natured people. 'The environment and the air are clean because we have no industry at all. 'The advantages of Bulgaria as a destination for elite immigrants including chalga music, highways, subway, gypsies and romantic, concrete-filled resorts with first-class alcoholic beverages of the Tsar Kiro brand. 'We also have experienced prostitutes, and the optional payment of taxes with the possibility to drain as much as you wish from the tax system. 'Our population is shrinking from happiness, which is why we need reinforcement.' The letter then states that two million Bulgarians will have emigrated by early next year, and the country's population is expected to drop to a 'critical minimum' of five million by 2050. Copies of the sarcastic invitation . were also sent to Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev, Prime Minister . Boyko Borisov and parliament chairwoman Tsetska Tsacheva, it states.

French . optician chain tycoon Alain Afflelou - who has an estimated 190 million . pounds fortune - has announced this month he was moving to London for . 'business reasons'. Stunning: Aside from some of the more unusual enticing comments in the letter, it also highlights the country's stunning scenery, such as this view from Gela Village . The exodus comes after Prime minister David Cameron angered the French in June when he said Britain would 'roll out the red carpet' to welcome more French businesses to the UK. He told a business summit in Mexico: 'And they can pay tax in Britain and pay for our health service and schools and everything else.' Paris estate agents have also warned that France's luxury property market had hit a 'selling panic' as the super-rich rushed to move away. Luxury property agent Daniel Feau said: 'It's nearly a general panic out there with some 400 to 500 residences worth more than one million euros coming onto the Paris market since May.' And British estate agent Sotherby's said this summer that its French offices sold more than 100 properties over 1.7 million euros between April and June this year - a marked increase on the same period in 2011. Sotheby's French boss Alexander Kraft said: 'The result of the presidential election has had a real impact on our sales. 'Now a large number of wealthy French families are leaving the country as a direct result of the proposals of the new government.'","Letter sent to French stars from Bulgarian policy centre .

Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said in a statement that the government, which is funding and overseeing the victim's treatment, had decided to send her abroad on the recommendation of her doctors. 'Despite the best efforts of our doctors, the victim continues to be critical and her fluctuating health remains a big cause of concern to all of us,' he said. Meanwhile, authorities are attempting to stem any further violence from demonstrations that erupted in reaction to the rape. Police have barricaded streets, blocked metro stations and increased their presence in the city centre of New Delhi. One police officer has been killed during the protests. A 47-year-old married father-of-three died after three days' treatment in hospital, according to news service Al Jazeera .

He was found on the ground during the protests. Eight people have been arrested and charged in connection with his death. His relatives, speaking on Al Jazeera, blame 'the people' for his death. 'It . is the fault of the people. He was only doing his duty and following . police orders. But the public attacked him and killed him so the people . are responsible,' one relative said. Police . said an autopsy showed the officer had a heart attack that could have . been caused by injuries suffered during violence at the protest. An .

As news of the horrific assault reached the public in India, outraged and disgusted civilians took to the streets in protest. Across . the country there have been demonstrations, including candle-lit vigils . and street protests with placards, chants and road blocks. During the days of protests, reports reveal more than 100 people and about 70 officers have been hurt. Police . have used batons, teargas and water cannon to try and disperse the . demonstrators after the authorities attempted to limit the public . gatherings.

Clashes: Police have been criticised for using heavy handed tactics against demonstrators who are demanding better protection of women following the brutal bus gang rape . But it looks like there is no end in sight for the demonstrations, however, as another march took place today in the city. Those taking part were demanding a government crackdown on the daily harassment Indian women face, ranging from groping to severe violence. Protesters demanding safer public transportation for women and the resignation of Delhi's police commissioner tried to march to the major India Gate traffic circle in central Delhi before being stopped by police in riot gear manning barricades. Protesters carried signs reading, 'Immediately end rape culture in India' and 'Zero tolerance of violence against women'. Rape victims rarely press charges because of social stigma and fear they will be accused of inviting the attack. Many women say they structure their lives around protecting themselves and their daughters from attack. Some protesters have called for the death penalty or castration for rapists, who under current laws face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pledged today to take action to protect the nation's women. Singh's government set up two committees in response to the protests. One, looking into speeding up sexual assault trials, has already received 6,100 email suggestions. The second will examine what lapses might have contributed to the rape - which took place on a moving bus that passed through police checkpoints - and suggest measures to improve women's safety. 'Let me state categorically that the issue of safety and security of women is of the highest concern to our government,' Singh said at a development meeting. He urged officials in India's states to pay special attention to the problem. 'There can be no meaningful development without the active participation of half the population, and this participation simply cannot take place if their security and safety is not assured,' he said.

Cherished: British couples who cannot have their own babies are looking more at foreign surrogacy as a way of starting a family (file picture) New figures have highlighted an increasing demand for 'wombs for hire' from foreign surrogate mothers. The research, published in The Journal of Social Welfare and Family Law, reveals how the number of couples registering children to foreign surrogates has almost trebled in the past five years. The demand by Western couples for women to give birth to their babies is shown by the number of 'parental orders' granted to parents - which enable the child to be taken from the surrogate. The process, driven particularly by Indian agencies, was completed 47 times in 2007 and 133 in 2011. But the real figures are believed to be much higher, and experts have warned of the increasing exploitation of women living in poverty who undergo the pregnancies to raise money. Their wombs are typically rented for between £10,000 to . £20,000. The practice of paying surrogate mothers is not allowed in Britain, meaning British couples who are unable to have children look abroad for an alternative solution. The options can be researched at events such as the Alternative . Families Show, where prospective parents can meet representatives from surrogacy agencies. 'I don't think the Human Fertilisation . and Embryology Authority has been strong enough on this,' Marilyn . Crawshaw, author of the research and senior lecturer at the University of York, told The Independent. 'There is concern about child trafficking. The World Health Organisation held a meeting on this. Bond: Parents desperate to have children will pay thousands of pounds to foreign agencies to arrange the birth of their child (file picture) 'One report described a surrogacy ring in Thailand in 2011 in which 13 Vietnamese women, seven of them pregnant, had been trafficked for the purpose of acting as surrogates.' She added the official figures did not reflect the real number of children born in India to foreign parents. Natalie Gamble, a lawyer specialising . in surrogacy cases, said important regulations were in place to protect . children at risk from international trafficking, but there were no . safeguards in place for overseas surrogacy. The practice follows a decline in international adoptions, which has plummeted to its lowest point in 15 years. The number dropped from a high of 45,000 in 2004 to . an estimated 25,000 last year, according to research by Peter Selman, an expert on international adoptions at Britain's . Newcastle University. The reduction has been attributed to crackdowns against baby-selling, the world economy and efforts by countries to place more children with domestic families.","Number of British couples registering children to foreign surrogates has almost trebled in the past five years .

"By . Sean Poulter . UPDATED: . 17:02 EST, 8 July 2011 . British Gas triggered fury last night with inflation-busting increases in bills that will add almost £200 a year to the cost of heat and light. The news will send a shiver through the 13million families  the firm serves – roughly half  the country – against a background of the biggest squeeze on living standards in generations. Gas is going up 18 per cent and  electricity by 16 per cent next month, taking the average annual dual-fuel bill to a record £1,288. The surge in bills is being accelerated by a host of controversial ‘green’ taxes designed to drive a shift to wind, wave, solar and nuclear power. Energy: British Gas has announced an 18 per cent price hike for gas and 16 per cent price increase for electricity . These add around £100 a year to energy bills, according to the industry regulator Ofgem, though experts suggest the figure could be as much as £150. High bills have thrown millions of families and pensioners into ‘fuel  poverty’, which means that they face a nightmare choice each winter between heating and eating. The latest price hikes, if all suppliers follow suit, are predicted to push up the number in this situation by some 2.8million to almost 12million. The energy companies claim the price rises are necessary to reflect increases in the cost of gas and electricity on international wholesale markets. However, this is rejected by the official customer body Consumer Focus. It points out that the current wholesale gas price is 29 per cent less than in the summer of 2008. Costly business: How the price hikes have affected household bills . By contrast, the price British Gas is charging its customers is up by 44 per cent. On electricity, the wholesale price is down by 37 per cent over the past three years, but the British Gas bill is up by 21 per cent. Up to 900 jobs will be axed at . Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) after the company announced today it . was immediately suspending all its doorsteps sales. The decision to abandon old-fashioned . door-to-door selling follows a breakdown in confidence in the practice . among consumers, the energy giant said. It also comes two months after the . company was found guilty of using doorstep salesmen to mislead potential . customers in a case brought against it by Surrey County Council. Commission-based doorstep selling has . ceased to be an effective way to gain customers for the long term, the . firm said, adding that it expected to permanently close its doorstep . sales operations. Since household gas and electricity . supply markets opened up to competition in the 1990s, doorstep, . telephone, online, venue and partnership sales have been used by leading . energy companies to encourage customers to change their supplier of . electricity and gas. In 2010-11, about 45% of SSE's total . customer gains in Britain came from doorstep sales, the company said. The rest came from telephone, venue, online, direct mail and partnership . sales, which will all continue. The evidence will increase suspicions that British Gas, its parent company Centrica and the other major energy suppliers are profiteering. Profits at British Gas hit an all-time high of £742million last year, while those for Centrica soared by almost a third to £2.4billion, generating big bonuses for bosses. The chief executive of Consumer Focus, Mike O’Connor, said: ‘This price rise will send a shock wave across the country. ‘The impact on customers will be severe, piling more pressure on stretched household budgets. ‘Consumers simply don’t trust that energy companies have customers’ interests at heart and rightly question whether prices are fair.’ British Gas claimed that the Consumer Focus analysis of changes in wholesale and retail prices was ‘highly misleading’. It said the figures did not reflect increases in the costs of doing business. Earlier this year, Ofgem accused energy firms of being greedy and lazy. It complained that customers are bamboozled by more than 300 complex tariffs. A number of investigations are under way over the mis-selling of energy deals, particularly through doorstep salesmen. There are also suspicions the ‘big six’ firms – British Gas, Scottish & Southern Energy (SSE), nPower, E.on, Scottish Power and EDF – are failing to compete on price and service. Scottish Power announced in June that it was hiking its cost of gas by 19 per cent this August. Ofgem is sending in a team of independent accountants to look at the books of the major suppliers to discover the truth about prices and profits. The Coalition has failed to deliver on promises to order a Competition Commission investigation into prices. Yesterday, the Energy and Climate . Change Secretary, Chris Huhne, argued that the best way to avoid bill . shocks is to insulate homes and switch away from fossil fuel to nuclear . and green power. ‘The UK . electricity market has to change, so that we escape the cycle of fossil . fuel addiction. Alternatives like renewables and nuclear power must be . allowed to become the dominant component of our energy mix,’ he said. However . Labour MP John Robertson, who sits on the energy and climate change . select committee, described Mr Huhne’s efforts as ‘weak’. He said: ‘There are new burglars in . this country and they are the energy companies. These price hikes are . deeply irresponsible and a disgrace. It should be a crime as it will be a . cold, bare and hard Christmas this year for many.’ He called on ministers to reverse a £100 cut in the winter fuel allowance to pensioners due to be implemented later this year. British Gas managing director Phil Bentley said the firm had no choice but to pass on the increase in wholesale prices since last winter. ‘We know there is never a good time to raise prices but we are buying in a global energy market and have to pay the market rate,’ he said. He suggested other firms will soon put up their prices, saying: ‘Rising wholesale costs is an issue facing all energy suppliers.’ The firm’s managing director of services and commercial, Chris Jansen, risked being swamped with complaints after advising customers worried about their bills to email him directly on ‘chris.jansen@britishgas.co.uk’.","Average annual dual-fuel bill to hit record £1,288 .

Iraq has been shipping oil to the Syrian government to provide it with vital fuel at a time when Syria is under international sanctions, it was claimed last night. Documents unearthed by the Financial Times show that the Iraqi government, led by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, is providing Syria with 720,000 tons of fuel oil in a one-year contract. Baghdad's Goverment is supported by the U.S. Government, and there are concerns in Washington about the contract with Syria, which is currently under trading sanctions. The Iraqi Oil Ministry delivered oil worth $14 million over June and . July - with the payments made in cash. Iraqi oil to sanction-hit Syria: A worker turning a valve at the Shirawa oil field, where oil was first pumped in Iraq in 1927, outside the northern city of Kirkuk . A U.S. State Department official, speaking anonymously, said the shipments did not violate U.S. or EU sanctions. But he added: 'Perceptions matter, so we encourage countries trading with Syria to be open about their legal and non-sanctionable exchanges. 'If this is going to continue, we think the Iraqis should be up front about it.' The news comes after U.S. officials complained that Iraq was allowing Iranian planes - carrying weapons - to fly across its airspace on their way to Syria. Syria or Iraq did not respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile Turkey has authorised troops to launch cross-border attacks against Syria yesterday as its military fired on targets in the country for a second day. The attacks yesterday was in retaliation for shelling by Syrian forces that killed two women and three of their daughters in the Turkish border town of Akcakale last Wednesday. Deadly strikes: Smoke rises after a mortar bomb fired from Syria landed in Turkish soil on the Turkish-Syrian border in southern Hatay province on Monday . Turkish President Abdullah Gul said . on Monday the 'worst-case scenarios' were now playing out in Syria and . Turkey would do everything necessary to protect itself, as its army . fired back for a sixth day after a shell from Syria flew over the . border. Gul said the violence in Turkey's . southern neighbor, where a revolt against President Bashar al-Assad has . evolved into a civil war that threatens to draw in regional powers, . could not go on indefinitely and Assad's fall was inevitable. 'The worst-case scenarios are taking . place right now in Syria. Our government is in constant consultation . with the Turkish military. Whatever is needed is being done immediately . as you see, and it will continue to be done,' Gul said. 'There will be a change, a transition . sooner or later. It is a must for the international community to take . effective action before Syria turns into a bigger wreck and further . blood is shed, that is our main wish,' he told reporters in Ankara. An unknown number of Syrian troops based near a checkpoint were said to have died in the reprisals. The bill paves the way for unilateral action by Turkey's armed forces inside Syria without the involvement of Turkey's Western or Arab allies. Turkey has used a similar provision to repeatedly attack suspected Kurdish rebel positions in northern Iraq. Syria has admitted it was responsible for this week's shelling and formally apologised for the deaths, a top Turkish official said. Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay has reassured the U.N. that 'such an incident will not occur again.' The violence, which prompted Nato to convene an emergency meeting, marks a dangerous escalation of the war which has engulfed Syria for 18 months. Ibrahim Kalin, a senior adviser to prime minister Tayyip Erdogan, said: ‘Turkey has no interest in a war with Syria but Turkey is capable of protecting its borders and will retaliate when necessary. The border violence has added a dangerous new dimension to Syria’s civil war, dragging its neighbour – a sanctuary for 90,000 refugees – deeper into a conflict activists say has killed 30,000.","Syria pays in cash before each delivery of oil - even as regime's reserves of money plummet .

Gunman: Bartholomew Granger started a shootout outside the court where his trial was taking place . A grand jury has amended the charges against the suspect in a fatal shooting outside a Texas courthouse to make him eligible for the death penalty. Bartholomew Granger, is accused of the March 14 death of 79-year-old Minnie Sebolt. He was set for trial later this month on nine felony charges. A grand jury Thursday elevated the charges to include capital murder. Prosecutors say the 41-year-old Granger was trying to kill relatives in retaliation for testimony against him at his sexual assault trial. Sebolt was caught in the gunfire. Assistant District Attorney Ed Shettle says the trial - moved to Galveston - now won't start until next year. He says the death penalty isn't likely to be waived and prosecutors probably will let a jury decide punishment. In March, Granger, apparently shot his 20-year-old daughter and her mother as he went on a rampage during the lunch recess of the trial at Jefferson County Courthouse in Beaumont, Texas. His daughter Samantha Jackson, who testified against him in March, was in critical condition after the shootout, and a 79-year-old bystander was dead. After the shooting, Granger ran to a nearby building and took hostages while being besieged by police, but the hostages turned on him and took away his gun. When negotiating with officials he apparently sounded more concerned with seeking medical treatment than with evading justice, and upon emerging from the building he was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. Hospital: All four shooting victims and the gunman were taken for medical treatment . Seabolt was shot as she tried to escape Granger's onslaught by running in to the courthouse, and died of her wounds. As the gunman fled the scene, he ran over his own daughter with a pickup truck, sending her to hospital where she remains in a critical condition. The other two victims - Granger's ex-wife and another bystander - were treated at hospital but released later in the day. When . he sought shelter in a business in the neighbourhood, the building's . occupants 'refused to be victims' and fought back instead, according to . police. 'They took the gun away from him and unlocked the door for the SWAT team,' a spokesman said. Granger . agreed to surrender himself in exchange for medical treatment, but when . he was discharged from hospital he was immediately dispatched to jail. He had been rushed to the hospital with 'very serious injuries', according to police. Standoff: Police marksmen stake out the building where Granger held several people hostage . Photographs taken by the Beaumont Enterprise show that Granger shot one victim just outside of the courthouse. Judge Larry Gist, whose courtroom is . in the building where the shooting took place, told CNN that he . 'believed one of the witnesses may have . been the mother of the child'. 'It was pandemonium,' said Judge Gist, describing the scene outside the courthouse. When he heard gunshots ring out, . witness Ricky Gandy said he rushed to his office window, whch overlooks a . parking lot near the shooting scene. 'Once it started, it was kind of like . the Fourth of July,' said Gandy. 'Several shots, I imagine, I'm . guessing at least 30 shots all together.' Granger had . been on trial at the courthouse since Monday and was scheduled to . resume testimony Wednesday afternoon, Judge John Stevens told KFDM. The . 41-year-old has a lengthy criminal history that includes convictions . for possession of marijuana and unlawfully carrying a firearm, according . to police reports. Granger's lawyer Rife Kimler said the ongoing case was emotional, but he thought the trial had been going reasonably well. 'I didn't have him on my list of . dangerous ones,' Kimler said of Granger.

One manufacturer, Bellco Sports, which sells tens of thousands of its £1 balls every year in high streets all over the UK, confirmed it has had to comply with the EU regulations and brand them with the warning. The balls bear the CE mark, which stands for Conformité Européene – translated as European Conformity – to show that they comply with EU legislation and are passed as meeting ‘harmonised levels of safety’. Corner shop boss Jamal Hasan, from Hackney in east London, said he had ‘no idea’ that the balls came with a health and safety warning. He said: ‘I sell hundreds of these balls every year, usually to parents with toddlers who are just learning to kick a ball. Caution: Brightly coloured plastic balls with a circumference of 25in must come with the caution: 'Warning! Not suitable for children under three years.

I don’t see how it is physically possible for her to choke on a ball that’s bigger than her own head.

A newspaper poll in Australia has revealed that more than two-thirds of people do not blame DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian for the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha. More than 34,000 readers took part in the Sydney Daily Telegraph newspaper's poll, with 68 per cent saying the blame should not be apportioned to the radio presenters. It comes as the Australian press accused the UK media of playing a 'blame game' in the wake of the incident. 2Day FM remained under siege today, with internet hoaxers setting up fake pages, and the hacking group Anonymous allegedly threatened the station's advertisers in a video posted on YouTube. Scroll down for video . 'Witch-hunt': The Australian press has accused the UK media of playing a 'blame game' following nurse Jacintha Saldanha's death. The nurse was duped by a hoax call from radio presenters Michael Christian, left, and Mel Greig, right . Headlines: Nurse Jacintha Saldanha's death made the front pages of most of Australia's main media players today . Mother-of-two Mrs Saldanha, 46 was . found dead on Friday in staff accommodation at the hospital where Kate, . 30, had been treated for acute morning sickness. She . was one of two nurses duped into believing that two 2Day FM presenters . putting on accents were the Queen and Prince Phillip attempting to get . an update on Kate's condition. Her death made the front page . of most of Australia's biggest papers, with much of the focus falling . on Michael Christian and Mel Greig, the two young DJs at the eye of the . storm. The pair are said to be receiving counselling following Mrs Saldanha's death. A copycat page pretending to be the radio station's real website has added to problems for the company. The copycat, which is using the . station's official logo, has outraged users by asking them to vote on . whether they would commit suicide if they received a prank call. 'Comment if you would kill yourself if you got prank called and like if you wouldn't kill yourself,' said the bogus site. Many . Australian media commentators were today defending the DJs at the . centre of the controversial prank and accused the British media and . members of the public who took to Twitter and Facebook to lambast the . pair of 'witch hunt'. The Sydney Morning Herald quoted a spokeswoman for Austereo as describing the backlash in the British media as 'ferocious'. She said: 'Australia seems to be much more balanced. In the UK it's like they're on a witch-hunt. 'It's . intense and what's incredible to me is it's so much easier for the . British media to have us as the target (than the hospital).' Top story: Many Australian newspapers have focused on the prank's devastating outcome both for the nurse's family and the two DJs at the centre of the storm . Finger pointing: Many papers talked of a 'blame game' being played by UK media following the radio prank . Andrew Bolt wrote in the Herald Sun . that Grieg and Christian could potentially face the same fate as . Jacintha Saldanha as they seek 'intensive counselling' in the wake of . the nurse's death. He said: 'To be guilty of bad taste is . one thing but to be held guilty of manslaughter is a monstrously unfair . other, and makes the finger pointers seem hypocrites. 'Want to push more people over the edge? Keep on screaming ""blood on their hands"".' Siobhan Duck of the same newspaper called for people not to point the finger of blame at Greig and Christian. An . opinion piece written in a similar tone in the Australian Sunday . Telegraph said: 'It is profoundly unfair to load responsibility for Ms . Saldanha's death upon the shoulders of 2DayFM's young presenters. 'They could not have possibly known anything of the torment that clearly placed the mother of two at risk of self-harm.' The . paper blamed the Leveson Inquiry and a heightened awareness of ethics . among the British media as the reason behind the so-called 'blame game.' An article stated that while . accusations had been aimed at the hospital and its staff initially for . falling for the prank, the 'tide turned like a tsunami with the guilt . now aimed at the Sydney radio pair Mel Greig and Michael Christian' following Mrs Saldanha's death. The . Telegraph also pointed out that the reasons for Mrs Saldanha's apparent . suicide are unclear despite her part in the radio prank. An . article read: 'Mainstream media websites published thousands of . comments directly blaming Greig and Christian for the death. 'Both . responses are wildly out of proportion to the event. It is seductive, . but too simple, to blame Ms Saldanha's death on a radio hoax. 'Suicide is a complex act and can rarely be entirely blamed on a lone event, however distressing.' It was clear that many people were . taken in by the fake site. 'I cannot believe the radio has the balls to . post this message,' wrote one user. 'How dare them try and blame her . death on something else. I hope your station gets shut down and you lose . all your advertiser,' wrote another person who was tricked by the fake . site. A YouTube user claiming to be part of . the internet activist group Anonymous made a threat aimed at the DJs . and Rhys Holleran, chief executive officer of the company. A computer-generated . voice accompanied a vision of the Anonymous group's signature Guy . Fawkes mask. It said: 'You are directly responsible for the . death of another human being, a woman who was dedicated to helping . others, a mother who was loved, a respected member of the community who . was turned into a joke by your radio station. 'We have studied the facts and found you guilty of murder.' To add to the station's woes, shares in owners Southern Cross Media plunged by six per cent. Blame: A video purported to be from the Anonymous group condemned the two DJs . Duped: The King Edward VII hospital in central London where Kate was being treated for extreme morning sickness last week. Nurses at the hospital were duped into giving out details of her condition in a hoax call by two Australian radio presenters . Tributes: Flowers left outside the Nurse quarters to the King Edward VII hospital in London where Jacintha Saldanha died after recieving a prank phonecall from an Australian radio station . The Sydney Daily Telegraph paper charted the careers of the pair, in particular Michael Christian, who it described as a 'rising star' of Australian radio, whose life they said 'will never be the same again'. Tragic: An undated family photograph of Jacintha Saldanha, (right) the Indian-origin nurse who died after being hoaxed by an Australian radio show trying to reach Prince William's wife in London . According to the Telegraph, the pair had only just started working together when the prank call was made. Jane Hansen of the Sunday Mail was particularly sympathetic to the young pair and cited a similar journalistic experience of her own which had a profound effect on her life and career. She told how a story she ran on a television repairman charging customers for work not being carried out had killed himself following her piece. She said: 'I'm not going to sit in judgement, nor do I want to sound like an apologist. But I will say that suicide leaves everyone gutted and searching around for answers. 'There is no way such a silly prank should lead to such a tragic outcome, but the radio duo will blame themselves - and there will be plenty of haters ready to fan such thoughts.' The Sunday . Telegraph's front page headline 'Shattered' described how a 'juvenile' prank had destroyed lives on both sides of the world. The story told how Greig and Christian are in hiding and both receiving counselling following the incident. The same paper also featured the reaction of Kate Middleton's second cousin Lilian Lowers who moved to the remote New South Wales town of Gilgandra - ironically Michael Christian's home town - from Luton, Bedfordshire, in 1982 with her husband Ron. She told the paper that her sympathies lay with Mrs Saldanha's family. She said: 'It's absolutely shocking. There was no need to play that prank just for laughs. What a terrible thing to happen. 'I couldn't believe it.' The Australian described the hoax . call's consequences as a timely reminder of  the 'impact media in all . its forms can have on an individual.' One of Australia's biggest broadsheet dailies The Sydney Morning . Herald told how radio station 2Day FM were in crisis talks after . advertisers distanced themselves from the station and King Edward VII . Hospital's chairman wrote a letter to station bosses. The SMH reported that the DJ's have expressed a desire to speak to the press and publicly state their remorse. Pranksters: Mel Greig, left, and Michael Christian, right, have been suspended from their 2DayFM show . The prank seems to have divided opinion in Australia. More than 83,000 of the SMH's readers . had taken part in a poll asking whether their opinion of the hoax call . had changed in light of Mrs Saldanha's death. Just 27 per cent of those polled said . that the prank was a joke and that its 'consequences were not . intended.' 61 per cent said that they always found the joke 'in bad . taste'. One reader, named only as Daveywavey . commented on the newspaper's website: 'What was ever supposed to be . funny about trying to contact a sick, pregnant woman being treated in . hospital in her first (and most dangerous) trimester when the status of . the foetus was unknown? 'Even by Australian 'larrikin' standards, I'm not seeing the humour.' But . many Australian's agreed with claims that there is a 'witch-hunt' against the two radio presenters at the heart of the scandal. Melbourne, . Australia, resident Paul Gallacher tweeted: 'How was Jacintha Saldanha . disciplined by the hospital one wonders? The prank was a long shot. Hindsight is very convenient.' Meanwhile, . Matthew Grundy, Tweeting from Victoria, Australia, said: 'British media . rather hypocritical over 2dayfm scandal considering their phone tapping . scandal. Did they hound the nurses involved?' A fellow Australian Twitter user known only as Sam added: 'No-one could . possibly have foreseen the tragic aftermath of the 2dayfm prank call, . and therefore the blame game should end.'","Australian newspapers claim UK press is on a 'witch-hunt' following the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha .

The watchdog is to examine the scale of severance packages in the New Year after MPs recently claimed that losing a job at the BBC was like ‘winning the lottery’. The move comes after it was revealed that the BBC’s former Director General, George Entwistle, received a £450,000 exit package when he left the job last month - double what he was entitled to. 'Winning the lottery': The National Audit Office is to examine the scale of severance packages in the New Year . New figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that since 2010, 194 executives have been given £100,000 payoffs. The corporation also used more than £6million of licence-fee payers’ money to pay 14 executives more than £300,000 each. The figures reveal that redundancy payoffs almost doubled to £58million between 2010 and 2011. In 2010, 481 BBC staff received redundancy payments worth a total of . £27million, while last year, 1,281 staff were handed payoffs totalling . £58million. In the first six months of 2012, 270 staff members were . given £14million. The average payout for departing BBC workers was . £51,000. It means that in total, the . corporation has paid £277million in redundancy to almost 6,000 staff in . the past seven years. Four executives have taken more than £8.5million . in payouts and pension deals with them in the past two years alone. The highest individual payment was £949,000, which went to former deputy director-general Mark Byford, pictured, as compensation for loss of office . A spokesman for the NAO, which . scrutinises public spending on behalf of parliament, said it will begin . an investigation in severance packages at the corporation as part of its . New Year programme, saying: ‘It is our intention that it will in the . programme.’ MPs were left ‘incredulous’ when . learning that former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson left with a . £670,000 pay-off in September - more than twice her £330,000 salary - . even though she had wanted to quit. Sharon Bayley, the former director of . marketing, communications and audiences, left in October 2010. She was . given a payout worth nearly £400,000, despite having been at the BBC for . less than two years. The biggest payoff was awarded to . Mark Byford, the former director of journalism, who received £949,000, . while an unnamed finance officer was given a £420,000 payoff. A spokesman for the BBC Trust said . today: ‘The Chairman previously suggested that it would be useful for . the NAO to look not just at the package George Entwistle received, but . at severance pay in the BBC more widely. We have received their schedule . of work for 2013 and we are pleased to see that they will take this . approach in a planned review for next year. ‘Work will begin on this as soon as . possible and we will, as always, ensure the NAO are given full access to . all the information they require to carry out this review.’ A BBC spokesman added: ‘The BBC is in . the process of reducing its senior management numbers, which have come . down by around 25 per cent and senior management paybill, which has come . down by around 30 per cent. Some of this has been achieved by . redundancy. ‘While these redundancies involve . costs in the short term, in the long term they represent savings for the . corporation as these roles are not replaced.’ Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of . the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It would appear that George Entwistle’s . much-publicised pay-off was only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to . eye-watering BBC severance packages. ‘The NAO is right to be looking at . this issue as a matter of urgency and Lord Patten should expect to face . serious questions about how these golden goodbyes can represent good . value for licence fee payers’ money. ‘As families up and down the country . have to tighten their own belts, the Corporation needs to do the same.

When three of their cats vanished without trace, the Wilcocksons thought they had simply run away. Their devastated children searched the neighbourhood and stuck up posters to try to track them down. But when – several months later – they found another one of their pets trapped in a cage, the family realised there was a more sinister reason behind their disappearance. 'Not proud': Gordon Wilson (left) baited a home-made trap with tuna to capture pets including Pip (right) Their neighbour, Gordon Wilson, 74, had been baiting a home-made trap with tuna to capture the pets before releasing them into the countryside. The pensioner hated the animals for fouling his immaculate garden. Only one of the pets that he captured managed to return home – and he was so disorientated by the experience that he later got run over and died. Two of the family’s cats remain missing, but there seems little hope that they will be found. Joanne Wilcockson, 27, has lived two doors away from Wilson in Hunmanby, North Yorkshire, all her life, and used to go to his house as a child to play with his Jack Russell puppies. So when three of her cats went missing in as many days in April, she never suspected he was behind it. Home-made: The trap that Wilson used to capture the cats before releasing them into the countryside . Pumpkin, a three-year-old black and white tom, was the first to go. The same thing happened to their second tom, Morris, and their tortoiseshell cat Pansy, both of whom were little more than kittens. Distraught children Ryan, eight, and Isaac, five, made posters and leaflets to distribute locally, but to no avail. Although Pumpkin did return home, he was ‘confused’ and was run over by a car shortly afterwards – leaving the family with just one cat called Patience. Over the summer, Mrs Wilcockson and her factory worker husband, Sean, decided to get another cat, a ginger tom they called Pip. When he didn’t return home one evening in October, Mr Wilcockson went to search and found him trapped in the cage at 1am. ‘I thought he had been hit by a car and wandered around the road looking for him,’ he said. Survivor: Pip was saved when his owner found him at 1am in a cage in a bush in Wilson's front garden . It was only when he heard a miaow that he was able to trace Pip to a cage in a bush in Wilson’s front garden. ‘I turned the light of my mobile phone on and saw he was sitting in this cage,’ Mr Wilcockson said. ‘I realised it was a trap immediately.’ The cage was made of chicken wire and baited with tuna. As the cat entered, a peg holding up a plastic flap was dislodged, sealing the animal in. Wilson was arrested the next day and questioned. He admitted responsibility and apologised to the family. He was later fined £250 for theft by Scarborough magistrates and ordered to pay £205 in compensation. ‘He said he was very sorry for what he had done and would never have done it if he had known the hurt he was causing,’ Mr Wilcockson, 28, said. ‘He has a really beautiful garden and the reason he gave police was he likes it pristine and did not want to put his hand in the soil and find cat poo. If we had known there was a problem we would have bought him some cat-repellent pellets to put down – but we didn’t know. ‘We still do talk to him though. He is very remorseful. We don’t expect to ever see the other two cats again but if anyone knows anything we would like to know if they are all right.’ Wilson said last night: ‘It’s not something I’m proud of.’","Gordon Wilson, 74, baited a home-made trap with tuna to capture pets .

"By . Damian Ghigliotty . PUBLISHED: . 01:14 EST, 29 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:27 EST, 29 December 2012 . The McAfee saga continues. Eccentric fugitive software mogul, John McAfee, who spent weeks on the run from Belizean authorities, recently revealed the ins and outs of his escape from the small Central American country, roughly the size of Vermont, into neighboring Guatemala, which deported him back to the U.S. The escape from Belize to Guatemala started with an undercover arrival in Belize City, McAfee wrote on his blog the day after Christmas. In the spotlight: McAfee is interviewed while posing for photographers outside the Beacon Hotel in Miami Beach . In order to dodge ‘multiple checkpoints set up along every highway exiting Belize,’ the 67-year-old says a look-alike he has known for over 30 years and who years ago changed his name to ‘John McAfee’ got himself arrested in Mexico, north of Belize, in order to convince Belizean authorities that they could stop their search for him. While the look-alike diversion was reportedly taking place in the north, McAfee and several friends, including two Vice journalists, climbed into an SUV and followed another friend, who was driving one of McAfee's trucks in the opposite direction. The idea was for the lead truck to act as another decoy - this time to confuse security checkpoints along the route. ‘If they stopped the truck, I knew the checkpoint officers would be swarming all over it. Subsequent traffic would be likely to be waved through,’ McAfee wrote. That, he says, was a backup plan in case his real plan failed. His real plan was apparently to rely on the weather. ‘In Belize, no checkpoint officers will ever stop a car in the rain,’ McAfee wrote. Back in the U.S.: John McAfee talks to the media last week outside the boutique Beacon Hotel in Miami . Dressed to the nines: McAfee walks out of the Beacon Hotel in Miami on Thursday. He said U.S. authorities have made no efforts to question him since he arrived . McAfee says he chose a day when the forecast called for a 100 per cent chance of rain and breezed through three highway checkpoints on the way to Punta Gorda, a small southern town on the coast of Belize. From Punta Gorda, he, his 20-year-old girlfriend Samantha Vanegas and the two Vice journalists, Rocco Castoro and Robert King, sailed to Livingston, Guatemala. McAfee was then arrested in Guatemala shortly after his arrival as the reporters he was traveling with unintentionally revealed his location via one of their smartphones, according to a Wired Magazine story from December 3. Vice had published a story earlier that day, titled ‘We Are With John McAfee Right Now, Suckers,’ complete with a photo of McAfee and Vice’s editor-in-chief, Castoro, taken with an iPhone 4S. McAfee was arrested a few days after making it to Guatemala and was then deported to the United States on December 12. He is now residing in Miami, Florida, where he says he has no intentions of going back to Belize to answer questions from the country’s authorities. Belizean police say they are looking to question McAfee about the murder of Greg Faull, a 52-year-old contractor from Florida, who was found shot in the head on November 10. The Belize government maintains that McAfee is not a suspect. Exasperated: San Pedro's Mayor Daniel Guerrero says police want to question McAfee, who is not a suspect . McAfee says he was set-up by the small country's political elite and that he will be killed if he is taken into custody by Belizean authorities. U.S. authorities have not attempted to question him since he landed in Miami, he told the Associated Press after he arrived. During a 12-minute interview with CNBC on December 14, the software mogul media said he has not done drugs in 30 years, but if he did, he has ‘the resources to do good drugs’ and not bath salts, which he said were for ‘people that don’t have a lot of money.’ He told ABC News the same week that he was left with no money or valuable property after playing the 'crazy card' and faking an illness in Guatemala to avoid being sent back to Belize. McAfee wrote on his blog on Wednesday that he plans to tell his side of the story more completely next Thursday.

Hundreds of passengers hoping to enjoy a pampered Christmas cruise on the imposing Queen Mary 2 are instead below deck with an unknown illness that causes vomiting and diarrhea. Earlier this week, 189 passengers and 31 crew members had come down with symptoms, which are consistent with the norovirus, a highly-contagious virus that is easily passed from person to person through contaminated food or water. The luxe liner departed New York on Saturday for a 12-night cruise in the Caribbean. A ticket on the prestigious liner can cost upwards of $4,700. Christmas disaster: More than 200 crew members and passengers on the Cunard liner Queen Mary 2 have fallen ill with an unknown sickness that causes vomiting and diarrhea (file photo) Pricey: A ticket on the luxe liner can cost upwards of $4,700 for a cruise around the Caribbean . Norovirus causes an inflammation of the stomach or intestines called acute gastroenteritis, producing stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Each year, norovirus causes some 21million illnesses, of which 70,000 require hospitalization. It kills about 800 people a year, the CDC says. The Queen Mary 2, with 2,613 passengers and 1,255 crew members, is now docked in Saint Maarten in the Caribbean, according to ship owner Cunard Line, which is owned by Carnival Corp. The CDC learned of the illnesses on the QM2 on Christmas Day, and of those on the Emerald Princess last Saturday. Vessels are required to notify the agency when two percent of those on board develop a gastrointestinal illness. Although the microbial culprit remains unclear in both cases, another reason to suspect norovirus is that the pathogen 'has affected a number of schools, hospitals, nursing homes and children's day care centres this winter' in the United Kingdom, Ms Cunard said in a statement. She did not immediately return MailOnline’s request for comment as to the current status of the Queen Mary 2’s passengers and crew. The vessel sails regularly scheduled crossings between New York and Southampton, England, between April and late November, Cunard spokeswoman Jackie Chase told Reuters in an email. 'In addition, many of our guests come from the UK.' Lap of luxury: The ship features, among other things, a full ballroom . Look at the stars: The ship also has the first ever planetarium on a liner . The QM2's captain is advising passengers with gastrointestinal symptoms to report to the medical center, Ms Chase said. Those sickened are asked to 'isolate themselves in their cabin until non-contagious. They are also asked not to proceed ashore, and any shore excursion costs will be refunded. Room service is provided to affected passengers and every effort is made to make them as comfortable as possible.' Of the 194 QM2 passengers who had fallen sick, said Chase, all but 12 had recovered as of Friday. In a post on the message board cruisecritic.com on Wednesday, a woman who said her daughter was on the QM2 said she 'just received a message from her indicating that the Norovirus is active on board.' 'The crew are working like crazy to . service all the guests. At lunch today I noticed the hand rails on the . promenade deck were wiped three times in about one hour.' On Thursday, someone reporting being on the ship posted that 'the restaurants are still full. The Captain last night recommended that people take all of their meals in the full-service restaurants rather than the buffet, but the buffet remains open as of this morning. We've been kept informed daily of the persistent cases.' Another post said: 'The crew are working like crazy to service all the guests. At lunch today I noticed the hand rails on the promenade deck were wiped three times in about one hour.' In response to the outbreak, the QM2 crew has increased cleaning and disinfection procedures, the CDC said, and is asking passengers and crew to report cases of illness and 'encourage hand hygiene.' Medical personnel are also collecting stool specimens from ill passengers and crew, which a CDC lab will analyze to make a definitive diagnosis. The $900million ship is considered by many to be the epitome of luxury, and has on-board, among other things, a spa, planetarium, library, theater, and fifteen restaurants and bars. Certain dining areas are reserved for passengers who hold the most expensive tickets. Port of call: The liner departed from Brooklyn last week and is due there again at the conclusion of the 12-day cruise . When the QM2 docks in Brooklyn, an officer from the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program and an epidemiologist will board, conduct an environmental health assessment 'and evaluate the outbreak and response activities,' the CDC said. Two officers boarded the Emerald Princess, also owned by Carnival, when it arrived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Thursday and are conducting an environmental assessment. The Vessel Sanitation Program has authority to inspect cruise ships that carry 13 or more passengers and call at U.S. ports. It gave the Queen Mary 2 a perfect 100 on its most recent inspection this past summer, but found a few minor infractions, including a lack of serving utensils with breakfast pastries at a buffet. There has been an incidence of a mild gastrointestinal illness among the passengers on Queen Mary 2. This illness is suspected to be Norovirus, which is highly contagious and typically transmitted from person to person. Norovirus is common throughout the UK, Europe and North America and has affected a number of schools, hospitals, nursing homes and children’s day care centres this winter. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has stated that Norovirus activity across the UK this season is 83 per cent higher than the same period last year. This has been well documented in the media recently. Queen Mary 2 is currently on a 12-night Caribbean cruise which departed from New York on Saturday December 22. There are 2613 passengers on board, the number of passengers with active symptoms today is nine. Enhanced sanitation protocols have been employed to help minimize transmission to other passengers. These comprehensive disinfection protocols have been developed by Cunard Line in conjunction with UK and U.S. public health authorities. The safety and comfort of passengers and crew is always our number one priority. As is currently standard procedure across our fleet, all the ship’s passengers were provided with a precautionary health notice advising of widespread Norovirus activity and the health measures to avoid contraction and spread, both on board and whilst ashore.","As many as 190 passengers and 31 crew members have become ill with unknown illness on cruise ship .

A child actor who won the heart of millions as loveable Freddie Peacock in Coronation Street, is battling cancer at the tender age of six. Hayden Whitbread, from Denton in Greater Manchester, who took turns playing the soap character with his twin brother Dylan, was diagnosed with a Wilms' tumour in June. About 70 children in the UK develop a Wilms' tumour - which is a type of kidney cancer - each year. One of the first symptoms is a swollen abdomen and if caught early there is a 90 per cent chance of beating it. The football-mad youngster insisted on turning up for his chemotherapy treatment in his Manchester City kit, after they inspired him by winning their first league title in 44 years. His treatment has caused his blonde hair to fall out and left him with a scar on his stomach where doctors removed the growth. However, Hayden has refused to let it get him down, telling friends his scar was due to a fight with a shark. His proud mother Joanne, a teaching assistant, said: 'Our lives have been totally turned upside down, but Hayden has kept us . going. 'No matter what has been thrown at him, he's taken it in his . stride and kept smiling.' Hayden was diagnosed this summer after he became exhausted . and lost his appetite on holiday. Tests at the Royal Manchester . Children's Hospital revealed he had a tumour on his kidney and he had to . start urgent treatment. He underwent six weeks of chemotherapy, . followed by surgery to remove his kidney and appendix. Hayden required . radiotherapy and further chemotherapy but has continued to go to primary school as often as possible. His parents Joanne, 41, and Steve, 39, hope he will finish his treatment at the end of . February. To boost his spirits Hayden was invited to visit the Manchester City training ground, where he met boss Roberto Mancini and all the players including his idol Joe Hart. The pair hit it off after they were . introduced and the England goalkeeper even took him into the nets for . some one-to-one training. Child star: Hayden pictured in 2007 as Freddie Peacock on Coronation Street with characters Rhona and Ashley . Mrs Whitbread said: 'We are a family of City fans - and . Hayden absolutely loves the club. He hasn't stopped talking about . meeting the players since the visit - and it really did help to cheer . him up. 'They were lovely with him, including Mario Balotelli who had a little chat with him and called him his mate. 'Hayden even saw his car - a camouflaged Bentley - and he was really impressed by that. It made his dreams come true.' Joe Hart told Hayden and his mother that he had been inspired by his bravery and asked him to be mascot for a game at the Etihad . Stadium last month. They won the game against Aston Villa 5-0. A City spokesman said: 'He is a terrific young boy and his bravery and character is an inspiration to us all. 'We'd like to thank him for being our lucky mascot against Villa, by leading us out and helping us to a 5-0 win.' Secret weapon: Hayden gives Joe Hart a run for his money as goalkeeper. He then saw Manchester City win 5-0 at the match where he was the mascot . He has also received a Cancer Research UK Little Star award in recognition of his bravery. The awards acknowledge the unique challenges faced by youngsters who encounter cancer. In Coronation Street, Hayden was last seen as Freddie fleeing with his soap mother Claire to start a new life in France in 2010. Actress Julia Haworth, who played . Claire, was one of the first to donate to the charity fund the family . set up to help Manchester Children's Hospital where Hayden has received . treatment.
