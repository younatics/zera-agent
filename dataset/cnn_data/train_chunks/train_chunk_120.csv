"(EW.com) -- Shame, indeed. Despite being one of the biggest breakout stars of 2011, thanks to his mesmerizing performance as a sex addict in the harrowing drama ""Shame,"" Michael Fassbender was surprisingly not called among the nominees for this year's Academy Awards. Long considered a shoo-in for a Best Actor nominee, Fassbender was edged out by first-time nominee Gary Oldman for ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" and dark horse nominee DemiÃ¡n Bichir for ""A Better Life."" (EW's Dave Karger hoped Oscar voters would take notice, and it seems like they most certainly did.) But Fassbender wasn't the only shocking snub in the Best Actor category. Ryan Gosling was a triple threat in 2011 with his acclaimed turns in ""Drive,"" ""The Ides of March,"" and ""Crazy Stupid Love."" (Though the latter would have been in the Best Supporting Actor race.) Between breaking up street fights, being a good sport about your, uh, supporting actor, and of course, turning in great performances, fans of Gosling and Fassbender are no doubt wondering this morning, ""Jeez, what's a guy have to do to get an Oscar nomination?!"" Joining Fassbender and Gosling in the notable snubs in the acting races are Golden Globe and SAG nominee Leonardo DiCaprio for ""J. Edgar"" (Best Actor), Gosling's ""Drive"" co-star Albert Brooks (Best Supporting Actor), and ""We Need To Talk About Kevin's"" Tilda Swinton, who lost her spot in the Best Actress race to ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo's"" Rooney Mara. As if awards show perennials like DiCaprio and Swinton getting left out weren't surprising enough, there were plenty of other baffling snubs in other categories. A Golden Globe nominee, Will Reiser's equal parts hilarious and heartbreaking autobiographical ""50/50"" was omitted from the Best Original Screenplay race. Hollywood legend and three-time Oscar winner Steven Spielberg was snubbed from the Best Director category for ""War Horse."" While ""The Adventures of Tintin"" won the Globes' Best Animated Feature trophy, it was no match for out-of-left-field choices like ""A Cat in Paris"" and ""Chico & Rita."" And lest we remind ""Harry Potter"" fans, the ""Deathly Hallows â€” Part II"" was left out of all of the major categories. See the full article at EW.com.

"(EW.com) -- For a film with such a straightforward title, ""Man on a Ledge"" turns out to be remarkably convoluted. Poised precipitously atop a high-concept premise, Sam Worthington is an escaped convict attempting to prove his innocence in the most elaborate way possible: He climbs out onto a hotel ledge and creates a suicide spectacle/diversion that allows his brother (Jamie Bell) to steal a diamond from an iniquitous real estate baron played with a perpetual scowl by Ed Harris. It's all ostensibly part of a master plan, as is his requesting Elizabeth Banks' beleaguered negotiator, but it feels as if the filmmakers have tried to stuff the plots of too many different movies into a single casing that's already overflowing with eye-rolling improbabilities. Despite the occasional dumb fun -- especially with the heist portions -- the leap of logic required to make it all work is enough to leave your brain pancaked on the sidewalk. C .

"(Rolling Stone) -- While his next official album ripens in the blazing South Florida sunshine, Rick Ross has delivered a delicious appetite-whetter. ""Rich Forever"" is a mixtape that plays like an album, with blaring, heraldic production by the likes of -Boi-1da and up-and-comer Beat Billionaire, plus guest appearances by Drake, Nas and Diddy. Themewise, ""Rich Forever"" is business as usual -- which is to say, all business. Ross remains monomaniacally focused on monetary matters, spinning punch line after punch line about luxury cars, dripping jewels and high-grade cocaine. Finest zinger: ""I got them keys in the crib/You wouldn't find 'em if you had the keys to the crib."" Best line about multitasking: ""Fornicating/Counting money with a f*** face.""

"(EW.com) -- There are few better ways for an actor to show off his chops than by playing the clever trickster in a thriller (think of Daniel Craig's 007 at the poker table, or Matt Damon's Bourne leading his CIA overseers through the looking glass). In the opening scenes of ""Safe House,"" you can tell what a good time Denzel Washington is having as Tobin Frost, an American spy in Cape Town, South Africa, who is five steps ahead of everyone else. His look is pure sleight of hand: In glasses, gray scarf, and overcoat, with an earring, a serious goatee, and his gray-flecked hair teased out, Washington resembles a hipster Malcolm X -- a great look for him, even if it feels like a costume. Meeting with an MI6 agent, Tobin purchases the mother of all top secret files, then wastes no time pulling out a lab kit that allows him to inject the file right under his skin. Very tricky! Moments later, he's under attack (a lot of folks want that file), so he turns himself in to the U.S. consulate. Only then do we learn that Frost is a rogue agent who ditched the CIA and has spent nine years trading secrets with America's enemies. Why has he done this? And why has he decided to turn himself in? Those questions form the bedrock of Washington's hyper-cool, minimalist performance. As a crew of Langley officials (Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson, Sam Shepard) purse their lips with importance, Frost is placed in a CIA safe house overseen by Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who's been twiddling his thumbs there for a year. When thugs enter, yet somehow fail to find Frost tethered to a chair, he and Matt escape, gunning through the streets in a smash-and-grab car chase. The movie, as if on an action time clock, punches in the standard set pieces: bloody fights, clattering shoot-outs, an escape through a packed soccer stadium. Some of this stuff is well-done, and some of it has been done a lot better. Yet ""Safe House,"" even when it's pummeling you effectively, has very little up its sleeve. Basically, the movie is a fizzless ""Bourne"" episode crossed with ""Training Day,"" featuring Washington as a good-egg-gone-rotten who, you know, has his reasons. Mostly, he schools Matt, his guard-turned-pursuer, in what it means to lie. Reynolds is physically impressive, even if his acting here consists of morphing from a deer-in-the-headlights look to a mean squint as the movie goes on. The director, Daniel Espinosa, shoots in highly saturated colors, edits everything into a frenzy, and creates the illusion of intrigue. But compared with a superior potboiler like ""Salt,"" which messed with your brain in entertainingly far-fetched ways, ""Safe House"" is action-movie porridge gussied up into a less-clever-than-it-seems mystery. Which is why the trickiness of Washington's performance begins to ebb, replaced by something somber that might even look tragic if this movie were actually about anything. B- .

"(EW.com) -- 2012 continued its box office winning streak this weekend, as Kate Beckinsale replaced herself at the top of the chart. Her new movie, ""Underworld Awakening,"" a 3D fourth installment of the popular vampires vs. werewolves franchise, debuted in first place with $25.4 million, good for a $8,252 per theater average. ""Awakening"" improved upon the opening weekend of its predecessor, 2009â€²s ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans,"" which started with $20.8 million (and did not feature Beckinsale), but fell short of 2006â€²s ""Underworld: Evolution,"" which kicked off its run with $26.9 million. Sony/Screen Gems paid $70 million to make the 3D action film, but if past ""Underworld"" performances are any indication, ""Awakening,"" which earned an ""A-"" CinemaScore grade, will have trouble recouping its costs. The first ""Underworld"" earned 2.5 times its opening weekend (that's known as a mulitplier of 2.5) and finished with $51.8 million. The second notched a 2.4 multiplier and earned $62.3 million. The third only managed a 2.3 multiplier, a sure sign of sequel fatigue and frontloadedness, and grossed $45.8 million. With Kate Beckinsale back in the picture, ""Awakening"" may find a larger total than ""Lycans,"" but with a very young audience (only 7 percent were 50 or older), it should continue the frontloaded trend and finish with about $56 million. In second place, George Lucas' passion-project ""Red Tails,"" a $58 million film starring Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr. that chronicles WWII's African-American Tuskegee airmen, took off with $19.1 million in its first three days. The strong debut came out of 2,512 theaters, which gave ""Red Tails"" a hefty $7,604 per theater average, the second-best in the Top 20. A few weeks ago, these high-flying numbers seemed unlikely. But in the week leading up to release, the film gained momentum. Over the past few days, YouTube views for the trailer swelled, perhaps thanks to Tyler Perry's public endorsement of the film. In a newsletter to his fans dated January 17, Perry urged audiences to see ""Red Tails."" ""I think we should pull together and get behind this movie,"" he wrote. ""Not just African Americans, but all of us."" Of course, that's not to undermine Fox's marketing team, which clearly did its job and brought in a broad range of ages. Many films that play primarily to African American audiences (or really, any niche audience) drop quickly in their second week -- Perry's last three ""Madea"" films have fallen by an average of 60 percent in their second weekends -- but ""Red Tails"" may avoid a similar fate. The film increased by a whopping 40 percent from Friday to Saturday, a healthy sign that the film is playing well with families and shouldn't prove overly frontloaded. Furthermore, audiences enjoyed the film, issuing it an ""A"" CinemaScore grade, which will likely help it endure. Who knows where the film will end its flight, but after three days of results, ""Red Tails"" seems early in its ascent. Kate Beckinsale's other current release, ""Contraband,"" which topped the box office last week, dipped by 50 percent down to $12.1 million, giving the $25 million Mark Wahlberg action vehicle a sturdy $46.1 million ten-day total. It should finish in the $65 million range. ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" fared about as expected during its wide release into 2,630 theaters. The 9/11 drama, adapted from Jonathan Safran Foer's novel of the same name, found a lukewarm $10.5 million this weekend, yielding a mild $4,010 per theater average. Audiences generally liked the Warner Bros. picture, giving it an ""A-"" CinemaScore grade, but unless ""Extremely Loud"" garners a surprising slew of Oscar nominations next week, it's doubtful that the film will climb to impressive numbers. In 2006, another 9/11-themed film, ""United 93,"" opened with a similar $11.5 million, and despite good reviews (much better than ""Extremely Loud's,"" in fact), it only found $31.5 million overall. A similar result seems likely in this case. Is Sandra Bullock the latest performer to fall prey to the Best Actress Curse? As the legend goes, after an actress wins the coveted Oscar -- Bullock won in 2010 for her role in ""The Blind Side"" -- her box office appeal actually decreases. Look at someone like Charlize Theron. Since winning the Oscar in 2004, she has appeared in exactly one hit -- ""Hancock,"" a movie which all but ignored her in its ads --and among her other nine releases, the highest-grossing one is, sadly, ""Aeon Flux"" with $25.9 million. I'm not going to put too much faith in the curse, but ""Extremely Loud"" does mark Bullock's least-attended nationwide debut in 15 years. And for Hanks, the film is his second straight misfire since ""Larry Crowne,"" which had to settle for $35.6 million. Difficult subject matter likely kept many audiences at bay. Steven Soderbergh's ""Haywire"" started its run in fifth place, pulling in $9 million. The film, which features former MMA fighter Gina Carano, earned a dismal ""D+"" CinemaScore grade, despite strong critical reviews overall. (Another well reviewed action film, ""Drive,"" earned a similarly unenthusiastic ""C-"" grade a few months back.) Relativity shelled out $23 million on the film, but ""Haywire"" will have to work hard to earn that number back at the box office. (Also, let's please ignore the inevitable discussion of whether women can open action movies at the box office and look at this week's number one film. Cool?) Further down the chart, ""The Artist,"" which expanded from 216 theaters into 662 theaters (that's a 300+ percent uptick in locations) on the heels of its Golden Globe win for Best Picture, increased by a rather disappointing 99 percent. After nine weeks, tons of awards, and a whole lot of press, the black-and-white film has earned $12.1 million against a $15 million budget. Perhaps people just don't want to see a silent movie. ""The Descendants,"" meanwhile, is faring much better during awards season. Following George Clooney's Best Actor win at the Globes, the drama increased 17 percent to $2.5 million, despite losing 100 locations, and has grossed $51.3 million. Oh, and a little movie called ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" surpassed the $700 million mark worldwide as well. The vampire franchise has proven remarkably consistent. 1.

"(CNN) -- Ringo Starr walks into the hotel suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel carrying a brown paper bag. It's his sack lunch, and he's packed it himself. He's also driven himself to the hotel and arrived alone -- no entourage, no bodyguard, no assistant, no fuss. It's fitting that CNN's interview with the iconic music star is taking place at an iconic hotel, which is like a second home to the former Beatle. This is where the Fab Four stayed when they first came to Hollywood in 1964, no doubt trailed by dozens of screaming girls and photographers as they ushered in the British Invasion. Looking at least a decade younger than his 71 years, Starr settles into the corner of a couch and talks about celebrity then vs. celebrity now -- this from the perspective of a man who has been famous for nearly 50 years. ""I feel like it's harder now for the celebrities,"" he tells CNN Entertainment Correspondent Kareen Wynter. ""There was no one bigger than us, and we were put upon. Then, Paul and I would go on holiday, or John and I would go on holidays, and we'd be fine. Now you can't go anywhere. The celebrity of today is so documented that I think it's a lot harder now. We had it easy. We thought it was hard, but not compared to today."" In 2012, his star hasn't waned. It has just taken on a comfortable glow. As one of two surviving Beatles, people are treating him like a living treasure -- and these days, he and Paul McCartney seem to be treasuring each other. Starr remains touched that Macca showed up at his 70th birthday party at Radio City Music Hall. ""I had no idea he was coming,"" he recalls. ""He jumped up to do the Beatle track, 'Birthday.' Nobody told me that he snuck in, and that he rehearsed with the band."" In recent weeks, Starr has been busy promoting ""Ringo 2012,"" his 17th solo album. He produced it himself and recorded it in Los Angeles with a number of his buddies, including producers Don Was and Dave Stewart and Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh, who also happens to be his brother-in-law. Below is a portion of CNN's conversation with Starr about his new CD, his relationship with McCartney and whether there will ever be a Beatles reunion. CNN's Kareen Wynter: What was your inspiration behind the new album? Ringo Starr: The inspiration behind the CD is that's what I do. I love to play, I love to hang out with musicians and I like to make records, actually. I like to write songs, and I like to collaborate with other writers. It generally keeps me busy. When I'm not doing that, I like to paint, I like to watch TV, I like to go to the cinema, I like to do all that stuff. But I LOVE hanging out with musicians and playing my drums. CNN: What drives you after having such a long career? Starr: You get up in the morning and you start the day. I like to get up early, and I don't like to get up and get right at it. I like to sort of work my way into the day, and then whatever comes along, I say 'yes' or 'no' to. CNN: Does anything shock you anymore? Starr: Nothing shocks me, no -- not on TV. It is how it is now. It's a pity that a lot of the reality singing shows -- somebody gets a shot for a minute, and even the winner seldom lasts more than a year. I played a lot of hours to get where I am, and it was a gradual build-up. So to go from nothing to the biggest thing in life -- you can't handle it. It was hard enough, and thank God, there were four of us to keep each other in some sort of reality. We all went mad separately, but we had each other, and we all came through gradually. So I think we were blessed that way. CNN: You got me on, ""We all went mad separately."" Starr: Well, we did, because we all had our moment, and then John or one of them would look at me and say, ""Excuse me?!"" and pull you back, you know? CNN: Do you miss those days? Four instead of two? Starr: Well, of course I miss them. We were great friends, and we played a lot together, and we went through the madness together. There were only four people who understood what we went through, and it's down to two now. There is nothing I can do to change that. I would like to be able to change it, but I don't have that power. CNN: Can you put the rumors to rest: Will there be a Beatles reunion at the 2012 Olympics in London? Starr: How can there be? Oh no, I'll be here. I'm already booked in America. CNN: Paul said you may want to do it. Starr: Paul can do it. CNN: But it's not the same without you. Starr: Well, he is doing quite well without me. He is doing OK. CNN: You're part of the act. Starr: Well, we had a great time at my birthday. He surprised me in New York, and he jumped up to do the Beatle track ""Birthday,"" and I was not going to miss that so I just ran to the drum kit, and that was fun. We have played a couple of times together. We did the David Lynch show a couple of years ago, so we have done that. But I will not be at the Olympics. I have to be very definite about that because they will say, ""Oh, is he coming? Isn't he coming?"" No, I am not going -- but to all the athletes, ""Peace and Love!"" CNN: What about in the future? Starr: Well, the door is open that Paul and I might play together, but it is not like a reunion. It is not going to be the Beatles, you know? They have those crazy ideas that maybe we could use their children. It is never going to happen. CNN: What is your relationship with Paul like? Starr: It's good. After all of the time, everybody has ups and downs. So we have ups and downs, but it is very up right now. I am so pleased for him and Nancy. We love Nancy. CNN: Their wedding was beautiful. What was it like seeing them walk through those chapel doors? Starr: Great. It was great, and he seems really happy and that is good. As I said, we love Nancy, so I think it's a great moment for him. CNN: How would you describe Nancy? Starr: Very down to earth. Very easy. She mixes right in and she loves music, so it can't be bad. And, you know, she is a very beautiful woman. Regal is a great word. Regal Nancy. CNN: The Beatles came up during a tumultuous time. Do you see any parallels between that period and what's happening today? Starr: As we all know, the world is going through a change, especially in Egypt and the Arab countries. America had to go through its change. England has been through several changes. France has been through a really big change. So it is just part of life, and God bless them. And it is great to see there is a lot of this (gives peace sign) going on in the world, and that is what it's about. We would love to be able to say, ""OK, it's a peace and love takeover."" But usually whoever is in power, as it seems, is injuring a lot of its own people. CNN: You really represent your ""Peace and Love"" theme. What do you hear from young people when they approach you? Starr: A lot of young people love ""Peace and Love."" I mean, they would like it to be that way. That is the way we all thought. But a lot of work goes into it. I just keep it going because it is a second in my life to think, ""Peace and Love."" How great is that? So if you put all of those seconds together, then soon you have got some time and it will make a change. CNN: What's next for you? Starr: Well, I think you tackle that as it comes along. I am making records, I am going on tour, and then I am off to do whatever else I want to do. So I have a very good life.","In recent weeks, Ringo Starr has been busy promoting ""Ringo 2012,"" his 17th solo album .

"(EW.com) -- An old-fashioned, tastefully constrained supernatural thriller, ""The Woman in Black"" embraces the elements of gothic horror movies with pleasing seriousness: If there's a door handle to rattle or floorboard to creak in the ruined mansion at the heart of the story's trouble, this production pauses for the sight and sound. And gray English skies with a likelihood of thick English mist is the unchanging weather forecast. The upside is, this classically creepy, unironic tale of loss and vengeance, based on Susan Hill's popular 1983 novel of the same name, pays fair homage to the kind of fare that has long been the specialty of the recently revived British company Hammer Films, where Christopher Lee once reigned as Count Dracula and Peter Cushing personified Baron Frankenstein. The downside is, ""The Woman in Black"" devotes an awful lot of time to the sight of Daniel Radcliffe, playing a sad, frock-coated lawyer named Arthur Kipps, creeping anxiously through that haunted house, clutching a candle and an axe, getting nowhere. 'American Idol': Portland ratings drizzle . Deadened with grief four years after the death of his wife, Arthur is dispatched to a remote English village to sort out a deceased woman's estate. There, in his own melancholy, the lawyer barely notices how fear has warped the secretive residents of the village, all of whom know and none of whom will tell an outsider what ails them. (CiarÃ¡n Hinds and ""Albert Nobbs"" Oscar nominee Janet McTeer have fun playing the village's wealthiest residents, the only two who provide hospitality.) Arthur does, at least, begin to wonder about the unusual death rate of village children. Oh, if ghosts could talk! Instead, this inconsolable spirit makes her feelings known through more ghoulish means. Sherilyn Fenn, Alice Cooper in Syfy 'Bigfoot' For a certain target audience, of course, the chief selling point of ""The Woman in Black"" is the appearance of Radcliffe in his first adult, big-screen outing of the post-""Harry Potter"" era. These Dan-ites can be assured that the handsome, self-possessed 22-year-old actor delivers nicely, conveying a lot in a performance that requires an excessive amount of silent tiptoeing. The horror-loving audience who wants to be scared silly, on the other hand, ought to know that, TV ads featuring night-vision footage of freaked out preview patrons to the contrary, this is a movie of quiet spookiness rather than loud BOO!s.

"(CNN) -- Trust falls? Rap sessions? Giggle weed? I don't know what tools of the trade Paul Rudd and director David Wain share to dream up the kind of inspired nutso stuff Rudd has done in smart-funny-raunchy winners like ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and ""Role Models."" But whatever it is, the two are in a groove -- and backed up by some blissed-out creative co-conspirators -- ""in Wanderlust."" The setup is sturdy. Rudd and costar Jennifer Aniston play George and Linda, sharp-edged Manhattanites who can barely afford their tiny living quarters -- known as a ""micro-loft,"" in Realtor-speak -- even when George brings home a salary from his hated corporate job. (Linda, still looking for her career métier, fails to sell HBO on a super-depressing documentary about penguins with cancer.) Then George loses that hated job. The broke couple needs to flee NYC. So they hit the road, resigned to accepting shelter and abuse from George's gloriously obnoxious ""successful"" brother down in Atlanta, a prize pig played to the snout by Wanderlust coscreenwriter/producer and fellow Wain regular Ken Marino (""Role Models""). Kate Walsh nude on mag cover . But somewhere on the road south, George and Linda stumble upon a kind of hippie-dippy Brigadoon, a past-its-prime Shangri-la, an anachronistic macraméd commune called Elysium. The place preaches peace and free love and beverages made of twigs, and is populated by crackpots just charismatic enough to seduce a pair of BlackBerry addicts like George and Linda. None is more appealing — and full of crap -- than the alpha male called Seth, played with goofy gusto by Justin Theroux. What happens in Elysium doesn't stay in Elysium: The alternative lifestyle begins to change the personality DNA of our essentially straight-arrow visitors. And that's exactly the sweet spot where Wain-ian comedy -- rooted in craziness that breaches the walls of ""normal"" -- lets Rudd shine. The actor is so clean-cut cute, yet so fearlessly capable of rolling in happy raunch. 'Downton Abbey': Top PBS rating since '09 . Actually, every actor who gets the joke shines, even when the story occasionally bumbles and bobbles its momentum. (Ah, the shackles of the ho-hum happy romantic ending.) It's a thrill to see sexy Malin Akerman (""The Proposal""), ""Six Feet Under's"" peachy Lauren Ambrose, priceless Kathryn Hahn (so memorable an adversary for Rudd in ""Our Idiot Brother""), and elder statesman Alan Alda bond over hippie clichés. And, no small thing, it's a pleasure to see Aniston thrive in her comedy zone, secure in the knowledge that for every inch of propriety she's willing to cede, Paul Rudd is ready to get 10 times as crazy for a grateful nation.

"(CNN) -- The wife of New York Yankees baseball star Alex Rodriguez filed for divorce Monday morning in Florida's Miami-Dade County Family Court. Lawyers representing Cynthia Rodriguez say she has officially filed for divorce from Yankees slugger A-Rod. The divorce filing said the marriage is ""irretrievably broken because of the husband's extra-marital affairs and other marital misconduct."" ""Alex has emotionally abandoned his wife and children and has left her with no choice but to divorce him,"" the petition said. Cynthia and Alex Rodriguez have two daughters together, Natasha and Ella. The split comes less than three months after the birth of the couple's second daughter, according to The Associated Press. National newspapers and gossip magazines recently have covered the troubled marriage between Alex Rodriguez, one of professional baseball's highest-paid stars, and his wife for weeks, chronicling rumors that both were having affairs. Reports have linked Alex Rodriguez, nicknamed A-Rod, with pop icon Madonna and Cynthia with rock star Lenny Kravitz. Both Madonna and Kravitz are denying the reports. Madonna's representative released a statement to CNN on Monday denying the rumors. ""I know Alex Rodriguez through Guy Oseary, who manages both of us. I brought my kids to a Yankee game. I am not romantically involved in any way with Alex,"" the statement said. Representatives for Kravitz also released a statement Monday saying that he was helping Cynthia Rodriguez get through the grief of her failed marriage but was not romantically involved with her. ""There is absolutely no affair between Cynthia Rodriguez and myself. This is unequivocally 100% not true,"" the statement read. ""Cynthia is a friend and is here with the godfather of her baby, who is also Alex's trainer, his wife and their baby girl. She came here to escape from everything happening in New York City. I opened my home to her as a friend, and I find it extremely hurtful that I am now being referred to as an adulterer."" Last year, the slugger was photographed out at night with a former Las Vegas stripper, sparking headlines like ""Stray-Rod"" in the New York Post. Rodriguez has been a lightning rod for praise and criticism during his 14-year professional baseball career. He has been an All-Star many times and has hit more than 500 home runs.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- After four years and 11 rounds of hard negotiation, the introduction of the ""Open Skies"" agreement in March was greeted with a sigh of relief. This was not just from airlines, but also their passengers. If talks in the second phase fail, the entire Open Skies deal could be torn up. The deal that allows airlines to fly anywhere in the European Union to anywhere in the United States and vice versa promised to increase competition between carriers and possibly cut ticket prices. But the relief could be short-lived. On Thursday, the EU and the U.S. began talks in Ljubljana, Slovenia for the second phase of the deal. This time round there's an even tougher set of issues on the table. And if an agreement is not reached by 2011, either side can pull the plug on the whole deal. Such a move could be crucial for airlines that have already invested hundreds of millions of dollars in preparation for reduced restrictions. Carriers have added and increased frequency of services, with some paying as much $60 million to get their hands on limited Heathrow slots. British Airways will also launch a new business-only airline following the deal between either Paris or Brussels and New York's JFK airport this summer. One issue the stage-two talks will address is cabitage, or rights for European airlines to operate domestic American routes. European critics have said the current deal offers greater advantage to U.S. carriers by allowing them to operate within the EU. An American airline can, for example, fly from New York to London, where they could pick up passengers and then fly to Germany. But as John Byerly, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Transportation Affairs and chief negotiator for Open Skies, explains to CNN, this is a red herring in terms of importance in aviation law. ""Not one U.S. airline has taken advantage of the right because it doesn't make commercial sense,"" he says. ""The aircraft that's right for transatlantic flights is ill-suited for operation within the highly-contested European Union market."" What's more, adds Kieran Daly, editor of Air Transport Intelligence, there isn't a simple quid pro quo in terms of cabitage. As he explains, the EU is not a single market in the same way that the U.S. is, and the travel patterns on both sides of the Atlantic are different. ""Nobody is really sure what the equivalent right would be in Europe for the American carriers,"" he says. A more important, and arguably more contentious, issue is around ownership and control. U.S. laws currently cap international ownership to 25 percent of voting stock, and prohibit ""actual control"" by foreign citizens. If these restrictions are removed it could pave the way for transatlantic airline mergers. Steve Ridgway, CEO of Virgin Atlantic Airways expresses his frustration that airlines are the only companies that cannot be owned by foreign buyers in the U.S. ""An airline is no different to a car company or a telephone company,"" he says. ""As long as there are proper competition rules in place, and dominance is not allowed, why does there have to be artificial restriction?"" Last August, Virgin completed a five-year battle to start a low-cost service, Virgin America, in the United States. The British company won regulatory approval by agreeing to distance ownership from the Virgin Group. In effect, the Virgin brand is licensed to an American-owned company. But Ridgway wants more. ""It took five years for us not own an airline,"" he points out. Yet despite Virgin's expansion into ventures such as Virgin America as well as Virgin Blue in Australia and V Australia, the carrier has not yet decided to follow British Airways' lead by launching services from other European capitals following the removal of restrictions under Open Skies. And considering how tempting a Madrid to Miami, or Paris to Los Angeles route could be to a non-flag-carrying carrier such as Virgin Atlantic, this is significant. Ridgway says a time will come for such routes. ""We need the right aircraft, we need the right market conditions, and we need to make sure that we are fighting the right battle here in our home ground. Because this is where our strength is,"" he says. But the other reason for hesitancy comes down to a lack of confidence for phase two of negotiations, he adds. Byerly doesn't deny the difficulties and political hurdles negotiators face. Opening up ownership to foreign companies has implications for homeland security, he explains. ""We rely on U.S. airlines to transport our troops and military cargo in time of war of emergency."" They must also tread carefully with airline labor unions. ""There are serious concerns about how to maintain a level playing field if you've got two unions, one in Europe and one in the United states, working for an airline,"" he says. But signs are that the U.S. is willing to keep an open mind. On Tuesday, United States surprised EU negotiators by proposing to drop investment restrictions for airlines for more than 60 countries. Senior airline executives have also voiced encouragement for an easing of ownership restrictions. Jeff Smisek, president of Continental Airlines told CNN: ""anything that would open up a freer flow of capital between the European Union and United States would be a positive influence."" As Byerly said, the U.S. is willing to envisage a positive outcome from the outset. ""We're committed to working in very good faith and with a lot of energy in the second stage of negotiations to try and reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial. That's our goal.""","The EU and U.S. have begun talks for phase II of the Open Skies air transport deal .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's competition watchdog has ordered airport operator BAA to sell three of its seven airports, including two in London. BAA must sell Gatwick Airport first. BAA must sell Gatwick and Stansted airports in London and either Edinburgh or Glasgow airports in Scotland within two years, the Competition Commission said Thursday. In publishing its decision Thursday, the commission said the sale of the airports will encourage competition ""where today there is no competition at all."" BAA owns seven airports in the United Kingdom, including London's Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. The Competition Commission says there are competition problems at all seven airports, with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines. Finding new owners for the three airports will result in lower prices and improved customer service, said Christopher Clarke, chairman of the study. All three must have separate buyers, the commission said. ""The precise pace and the precise ways in which the benefits from such competition will emerge may be uncertain, but we are confident that the benefits will build over time, driven by the momentum of the development of competition, and will be significant,"" Clarke said. In London, for instance, BAA's ownership of three airports prevents them from building more capacity and keeps prices high, the commission said. ""The intensity of price competition may initially be limited by current capacity constraints and price controls, but these constraints are themselves at least in part the result of common ownership,"" the commission said. BAA said it acknowledged the need to change but did not agree with all of the commission's findings. ""We believe the commission's analysis is flawed and its remedies may be impractical in current economic conditions,"" BAA said in a statement, adding it needs more time to consider the report before responding further. Carrier Virgin Atlantic, a longtime critic of BAA's ownership of the airports, welcomed the commission's decision. ""It will undoubtedly benefit consumers,"" said airline spokesman Paul Charles. ""Better airport facilities in the UK and lower prices will be the result. ... The important next step is to ensure that there is adequate oversight of the divestment process."" BAA must sell the airports in sequence, beginning with Gatwick -- which went up for sale in September -- then Stansted and then either Edinburgh or Glasgow, the commission said. The Competition Commission is an independent public group that investigates mergers, markets and regulated industries. The Office of Fair Trading, a government department, asked the commission to look into airport competition in March 2007. The once-state owned BAA, which used to be known as the British Airports Authority, was privatized in 1986 and floated on the stock market in 1987. It is now owned by Spanish property group Ferrovial.","UK airport operator BAA told to sell 3 of its 7 airports, including two in London .

"(CNN) -- A Brazilian cameraman died in a Rio de Janeiro slum while covering a police raid targeting organized drug militias, police said Sunday. Gelson Domingos da Silva, 46, worked for Band TV, a CNN affiliate. He was filming a large-scale incursion by a Brazilian Special Operations Unit (BOPE) into a ""favela,"" the Portuguese word for shantytown, or slum, when he was shot in the chest, Rio de Janeiro police said in a statement. ""The Military Police deeply regrets the death of cameraman, Gelson Domingos da Silva, while expressing the most sincere sympathy to the family and all media professionals,"" police said. According to a Band TV press release, da Silva was covering the operation in the Antares favela, west of Rio, as an ""embedded"" photographer with Rio police. Da Silva was wearing a bullet-proof vest certified by the Brazilian Armed Forces, often used by Band employees during these types of assignments, Band TV said. He was taken to a local emergency hospital but did not survive the gunshot wounds, Band TV reported. Rio de Janeiro police said the operation began early Sunday morning after intelligence reports indicated that drug lords and heavily armed groups were gathering at that site. Police said four alleged drug dealers were killed in the operation, and weapons and drugs were seized. Dramatic images of da Silva's last moments are being shown in Brazilian media, reminding Brazilians of how dangerous it has become for journalists to cover the drug war. The Committee to Protect Journalists has ""documented an alarming rise in lethal violence (against journalists) in Brazil in 2011,"" the group said on its website. ""Four other Brazilian journalists have been killed this year, and a blogger shot and wounded,"" CPJ reported. ""While Brazilian authorities have had success in prosecuting journalist murders, winning several convictions in recent years, the country still sees persistent anti-press violence. The October 2010 murder of a muckraking radio reporter became the country's fifth unsolved case in the past decade,"" CPJ reported.

"(CNN) -- Costume designer Mark Bridges can create eras with fabric. For ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Blow,"" he evoked the 1970s. ""The Fighter"" showcased the early '90s. ""There Will Be Blood"" went back to gritty early 20th century California, and ""8 Mile,"" ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and ""The Italian Job"" offered a range of contemporary looks befitting their locales -- and characters. With ""The Artist,"" a black-and-white silent film, Bridges brings back that golden Hollywood age -- both the peak of its glamour and pit of its shabbiness. He earned an Oscar nomination for his work -- his first, perhaps surprising given his work on some of the most notable films of the past 15 years. He spoke with CNN about how his job combines the best of all worlds, and what (or ""who,"" for those who prefer the favored Oscar pre-show word) he'll be wearing on the red carpet. The following has been edited and condensed from the original transcript. CNN: I understand you have a fondness for silent-era pictures. Mark Bridges: Ever since I was young. I have book reports from when I was in fifth grade or seventh grade on silent movies. My mother used to take us to revival houses because I was interested in it, so it's always been a lifelong interest of mine. And it combines with my vocation, and I was really, really excited with the possibility of doing this film. CNN: How did you go about getting the look of the time? Bridges: Without the color to communicate the language of telling the story, I was trying to tell the story through textures, whether it be lamÃ©, sequins and beads for Hollywood, or very flat rough textured wools to communicate down-on-your-heels, or the elegance of satin lapels for evening wear, or the shimmer of a beautiful nightgown. It became a story of textures telling the story. CNN: How did working with director Michel Hazanavicius compare with working with Paul Thomas Anderson (who directed ""Boogie Nights,"" ""There Will Be Blood"" and ""Punch-Drunk Love"") or David O. Russell (who directed ""The Fighter"")? Bridges: I don't see any difference, because my position remains the same: they give me the material, and I propose a way to contribute to the visuals of the story. Same thing when I read one of Paul's original scripts. I read it, we discuss it, then I go out and try to figure out what language of clothing are we making this story. It's always about how do I reveal this character, how do I reveal this moment through the character's external appearance. CNN: Actors say that it's getting into costume that allows them to become another person. It's like a personality change. Bridges: It's interesting when that happens in a fitting room. We start out with me and an actor, and then with the right combination of clothes or a talk about how a moment might be played or illustrated, suddenly there's this third person there who wasn't there when we started, and then we know we're on to something. CNN: How did you get into the business? Bridges: I was always involved in theater and drama. As a child, I loved movies, I always drew, I always loved fabric, I loved clothes, I loved color, I loved telling a story. So it's an amalgam of everything I enjoy, and it happens to be called costume designer. CNN: What are you going to wear? Bridges: I'm going to wear a single-breasted, peak-lapel Brooks Brothers tuxedo, which is very throwback to the period, and a custom tuxedo shirt from Anto of Beverly Hills.","""Artist"" costume designer Mark Bridges up for Oscar .

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- Til death do us part. On my wedding day, I will not be saying that sentence. Not that I'm not in it to win it -- I am -- only that if two people are told they can never leave, how do they know the other really wants to stay? Marriage is hard enough without the specter of death being the only way out hanging over our heads. To me, it's just another fire and brimstone tactic absentmindedly handed down from generation to generation just to get people to stay in line. Or give them comfort that once they kiss, they will always be there for each other. But it's a lot harder than that and sometimes things don't work out. Recognizing that doesn't threaten the relationship, it just means you're paying attention. And in a country with a healthy divorce rate and prenuptial agreements -- which are essentially Plan Bs before the ink on Plan A is even dry -- I think it's safe to assume there are a lot of examples of things not working out to pay attention to. This is one of the areas where the evangelical church needs to grow most -- learning how to minister to a society that can no longer be scared straight. The fearmongering has been undermined by hypocrisy, and the younger generations now find themselves in the enviable position of marrying and staying married because they want to, not because they're afraid not to. A recent Pew study found that the number of Americans 18 and older who are married dropped from 72% in 1960 to 57% in 2000 to 51% today. Combine that with the declining divorce rate, people getting married later in life and with seven in 10 millennials saying it's OK to have premarital sex (according to Public Religion Research Institute), and what you have is a generation that is totally over having their sex lives managed by people they're not having sex with. Now some religious conservatives would deem this perfect storm humanism and proclaim that the very fabric of society is fraying. They need to say these things because, well, this new-found empowerment threatens a business model that is based on fear. But church attendance has not been declining since the 1970s because people are shacking up. It's because the church as a whole has become stagnant while the society it's based in continues to evolve. Couple that with the disconnect between how we're told to live our lives and the lives being led by those doing the telling, and you can see why we're just less religious as a country. At some point, church leaders are going to have to figure out how to minister to a congregation that is not waiting to have sex and not afraid to say it. Not ashamed to say it. That's going to be hard to do but necessary if it wants to stay relevant. It's not as if people are falling in love less, not if the 13% jump in one year in the number of unmarried couples living together is any indication. So what is the church planning to do when the threat of hell no longer works? When people exchange ""til death do us part"" with ""you wanna move in?"", it may feel less pious, less certain and less concrete, but it's ultimately more tangible because it is based in the here and now, not in a future which may or may not arrive. No one, with maybe the exception of Kim Kardashian, enters a marriage with the intent of getting a divorce. But there are now people entering relationships with no intentions of getting married and their relationship is not less valid, their love is not less real, their future is not less certain. The church has to figure out a way to talk about relationships and marriage the way it is framed today, without all of the threats. Or risk being left behind. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Religious views of marriage as a lifetime commitment are outmoded .

"(CNN) -- Tuesday's deadly suicide attack targeting Afghan Shia just didn't fit the pattern of what had come before in this troubled country. The police formed the usual cordon at the attack site -- this time a shrine in Kabul. Sirens pierced the odd moment of eerie silence, but the police chief's face was contorted with fury and confusion, like he'd seen something new and troubling -- even after decades of conflict here. Yes, the insurgency has specialized in hitting targets right in the city center, often meters away from key institutions. Yes, they are aimed for effect. But mass casualty attacks like we used to see in 2009 are rare these days. The insurgents prefer to hit strategic targets -- unless their roadside bombs are maiming civilians elsewhere. And no, the Shia simply weren't targets before. Sectarianism was seldom an issue here: Afghanistan has lacked the Sunni-Shia divide in Iraq that helped to keep Saddam in power but made his fall so bloody. It has been spared the brand of Sunni extremism in Pakistan, where ruthless attacks on Shia are a shocking part of the fabric. The question of who did it was quickly answered but unsatisfactorily. The interior ministry here points its finger at the Taliban, despite an effusive denial from spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid. It's arguable that an offshoot of the Lashkar-e-Janghvi movement, which reportedly rang in a claim from Pakistan, is capable of mounting a sophisticated, targeted and vicious attack in the very heart of Kabul without some assistance. If they are responsible, it does require some explanation as to how a small, rogue group of extremists -- which has links to al Qaeda and the Pakistan Taliban -- could suddenly develop the capacity to penetrate the capital of a neighboring state. And are Pakistani extremists really operating freely inside Afghanistan now? Whether the culprits turn out to be the Pakistan-based Haqqani network -- the group blamed for recent high-profile and sophisticated attacks in the capital -- the Lashkar-e-Janghvi al Almi, or another complex part of Afghanistan's insurgency, fractured and complicated after 10 years, many Afghans place the blame at one source: Pakistan. That's the ""address"" that Kabul thinks the Taliban now resides under. That's who they blame for most of the ills here, despite simultaneously hoping they will come to the negotiating table and help. But we should not rush to attribute blame for one reason: The advent of Pakistani extremists trying to foment sectarian violence in Afghanistan at this late stage in the war is a prospect too terrifying to behold.","Tuesday's deadly suicide attack didn't fit pattern of what had come before .

"(CNN) -- As a writer, one of my most important responsibilities is listening. I try to do so with an open mind, so I can hear the voices of the characters whose stories I will tell. When I wrote about Afghan women in my second novel, I thought about the brave women I had met in Kabul and about their stories. Their voices came to me in hushed whispers. At times they woke me in the night with the urgency of what they had to say. I am indebted to those women, because without them, my novels would lack authenticity and would also be far less likely to resonate with readers. Supporting women's rights in Afghanistan is largely about listening. A recent report from international aid organization Oxfam summarizes it best: The voices of women in Afghanistan must be heard if a lasting peace is to be achieved and ""the international community is to fulfill its agenda of setting Afghanistan on its own feet."" In recent years, women have made incredible gains in Afghanistan. The end of Taliban rule has meant a new Afghanistan, with more opportunities for women. Millions of girls are back in school. Women are working, particularly in Kabul, as professionals in a wide range of fields. Afghanistan has a female provincial governor; there are women serving in parliament, the Ministry of Public Health, the Ministry of Women's Affairs and the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. Only the hardest cynic would dismiss these accomplishments as insignificant. Yet far too many women in Afghanistan are still denied a place at the table -- denied the right to speak for themselves. Oxfam's report illustrates how war and unrest, illiteracy, poverty and gender discrimination have made it nearly impossible for the vast majority of women in Afghanistan to contribute to the global dialogue about the future of their homeland. Without them, the gains that have been made in recent years for half of Afghanistan's most brilliant resources remain at risk. When I was a boy living in Kabul, I had a different experience. A different political environment meant women were respected -- their intelligence and accomplishments greatly valued. My mother was a teacher and school administrator. She was known on campus for her confidence and effective leadership. My aunt was a professor at Kabul University. She inspired young men and women to be creative and poetic, furthering Afghanistan's rich cultural and artistic legacy. My cousin was a physician. Men and women alike relied on her skill, strength and kindness. The women I have met in Afghanistan in recent years are equally talented. Though most have been denied education, survive without access to even basic health care and often lack even rudimentary shelter, they are determined, resilient, resourceful and optimistic. They have a truly indomitable spirit and are the real backbones of families and communities. If Aghanistan is to exist once again as a peaceful and thriving nation, it must make women's rights one of the cornerstones of national reconstruction. Any peace negotiations with insurgent groups must ensure that Afghan women are able to exercise their rights and participate in every facet of Afghan society without fear of retribution. They must be given political, social and economic power to help usher in and sustain the country's long-term redevelopment. Most importantly, Afghan women must be allowed the opportunity to be heard. As the International Conference on Afghanistan approaches in Bonn, Germany, world leaders must insist that women not only participate in the Afghan delegation but that all discussions around peace and reconciliation include how women will be involved. Afghan women's voices are an indispensable resource and without them, the story of peace and prosperity cannot be told. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Khaled Hosseini.","Khaled Hosseini: Oxfam report says Afghan women must have voice in Afghanistan .

"Marjah, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Authorities raised the Afghan flag over the battle-scarred enclave of Marjah on Thursday, a ceremony symbolizing the presence of the Afghan government in the Taliban stronghold. The red, black and green banner was hoisted over an area where U.S. and other troops have been fighting the Taliban in Operation Moshtarak -- the biggest offensive of the war. A few hundred people watched the event, attended by Helmand Gov. Gulab Mangal, other provincial and local officials, and military officials. ""I think we're feeling pretty good about the control of the populated areas, the infrastructure,"" said Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson, commander of U.S. Marines in southern Afghanistan. About 15,000 NATO-led and Afghan forces hope to oust the Taliban and restore Afghan government control to the region in the southern Afghan province of Helmand. They are working to persuade citizens to turn their allegiance away from the militants and toward the Afghan government. More Afghanistan coverage on Afghanistan Crossroads blog . Viewing the ceremony with hope, curiosity and skepticism, one local in the crowd said he doesn't trust the Afghan government or its security forces. Asked if he thought change will come, Abdul Qader accused the Afghan government of corruption. ""If the foreigners do it, things will change. If the Afghans are in charge, there is no way."" Another citizen, Mohammad Sardar, said the Taliban brought the people security, but not proper services such as schools and roads. He said that while he still fears foreign forces, he hopes they can bring about change. Qader said the foreigners won't be able to get rid of the Taliban completely, but the militants ""will put their heads down and fade away on the condition that help is brought, roads are built and security is achieved."" The event took place as NATO's International Security Assistance Force reported trends that show security is improving and signs of stability are emerging in the region. The offensive has been under way for 13 days and is expected to continue for at least another two to three weeks. Nicholson said there is still ""some fighting to do -- potentially in some areas that we haven't gotten into."" ISAF said in a news release Thursday that security is improving and signs of stability have been emerging despite ""occasional"" clashes between militants and soldiers. Haji Zahir, deputy district governor of Nad Ali, told 200 people in Marjah at a shura, or community council, that security conditions have improved and that more Afghan National Police were to be posted there, ISAF said. He ""promised to ensure the opening of shops and clinics, and personally oversaw the distribution of rice, beans, cooking oil and sugar to the gathering."" The NATO-led command said new shops have opened at Marjah bazaars, with telephones, computers and other electronics available.

"(Rolling Stone) -- Lenny Kravitz chose a life of rock and soul a long time ago and until recently was never tempted by the movies. ""In the last 22 years, while I was making my music, I was offered a lot of films,"" Kravitz tells Rolling Stone. ""I just didn't find the roles very interesting -- a lot of clichÃ©d type of stuff and really obvious things. I didn't want to make films because I can. There's no point in that."" That changed in a big way with his first feature-film role in the 2009 drama ""Precious,"" and now with a key role in next month's ""The Hunger Games."" Based on the hugely popular novel of the same name, the new film is set in post-apocalyptic North America, where teenage gladiators are chosen to battle to the death in annual televised games. Kravitz plays Cinna, stylist and confidant to the rebellious Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence), the central figure in the book and movie. ""I always figured it would come back into my life,"" Kravitz says of acting. ""I was an actor when I was a kid. When I realized music was my thing, I just gave it up. I put blinders on, just focused on music. It's come back now and I really am enjoying it."" Kravitz took the role after meeting with director Gary Ross (""Pleasantville"") and reading the first book of the best-selling trilogy by Suzanne Collins. ""I thought it was really good storytelling,"" Kravitz says. ""I'm very much into stories. The character was interesting. I like Gary's previous work. And I said, Yeah, let's go."" In ""The Hunger Games,"" his character creates a series of striking outfits for the young warrior, which isn't exactly a stretch for the stylish rocker. ""He's very streamlined, he's very quiet,"" Kravitz says of Cinna. ""He knows what he's doing. He's confident. He's got a big heart. I just liked the way he moved -- very smooth."" As a musician, Kravitz is used to being in total control of his work -- writing, performing and producing -- and that control reflects on him as an artist. ""It's about me, as it should be,"" he says. ""But in this case, it's got nothing to do with me. It's about a director's vision, a character, and I really like that."" The film opens on March 23. Up next for Kravitz is ""Negrophilia,"" the funk album he interrupted to record last year's ""Black and White America."" Music remains his central concern, but he now also considers himself a working actor. ""I'm just waiting for the right roles to come in,"" he says. ""Thank god I have a day job.""

"(CNN) -- For the third time in a year, Japan's government has intervened in the yen, its unit of currency, according to Japan's finance minister. ""While Japan is dealing with the reconstruction of the tsunami zone, if the surging of the yen continues, it could negatively affect Japan's economy and financial stability,"" Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda told reporters. ""Therefore, Japan has intervened in the currency market. We will continue to watch the movement of the currency market closely."" Minutes after the announcement, the Nikkei stock index shot up 100 points and the yen weakened against the dollar. The Bank of Japan responded to the move in a press release, saying that it ""strongly expects that the action taken by the Ministry of Finance in the foreign exchange market will contribute to stable price formation in the market."" Japan's economy, still struggling after the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis, has been hit hard by the falling U.S. dollar. Uncertainty by global markets over the U.S. debt deal caused the dollar to plummet versus the Japanese yen, a currency seen as a safe haven by investors. Japanese automakers and electronics companies have seen the currency shift eat into their corporate profits as the dollar has sunk. Japan's exporters operate on the global market with the U.S. dollar, but then repatriate the funds to Japan in yen. JP Morgan Japan estimates corporate profits have fallen approximately 5% in the last six weeks as the U.S. dollar has plummeted. Perhaps the hardest-hit company is the world's largest automaker, Toyota. The car maker estimates it loses approximately $385 million for every 1 yen movement up versus the dollar. By that estimate, in July, Toyota lost more than a billion dollars based on the currency shift alone. Toyota Motor Corporation this week, in announcing their first-quarter earnings for the 2012 fiscal year, called the exchange rate too much to bear. Senior managing officer Takahiko Ijichi said, ""I understand that it's our fate to adapt to ever-changing exchanging rates. But this situation, where the yen has passed 80 yen and is now at 76 yen, for us exporters, it's extremely tough.""

"Bonn, Germany (CNN) -- Ten years ago, Afghan leaders met outside Bonn, Germany, to lay out a road map to establish and sustain Afghanistan's government after the fall of the Taliban. On Monday, the nation's president for the last seven years, Hamid Karzai, will once again preside over a conference in the west German city to chart his nation's future. Yet this time, as opposed to just U.N. representatives facilitating the 2001 conference for a group of Afghan exiles and leaders, members of 85 delegations from various countries and 15 international organizations will join Afghans in the discussions. Their goal is to take stock of accomplishments and assess continued challenges in Afghanistan over the past decade, as well as to plot a partnership with the Kabul government amid plans to withdraw all foreign combat troops from the country by 2014. There has, admittedly, been notable progress in recent years. Afghanistan's economy has grown, albeit it at a slow rate. Despite reported corruption, Afghanistan has moved away from the repressive extremist rule of the Taliban and toward a more democratic political system, in which Afghans vote for their leaders. And the status of women -- strictly controlled under the Taliban -- has improved with a constitutional commitment guaranteeing equality, and 3 million girls are now in school. But the international community knows many of these gains hang by a thread. As it was in 2001, Afghanistan is still one of the world's poorest and corrupt nations. Even as international troops seek to wind down their involvement, the country faces a resilient Taliban insurgency, political instability and economic turmoil. Attendees at this Bonn conference are expected to address prospects for long-term aid for Afghanistan. That could well include a promise of substantial resources from the international community, given concerns Afghanistan's economic stability may suffer after international troops leave and funding levels dwindle. Karzai is officially in charge of the conference, seeking to demonstrate ownership over his nation's own affairs. Afghan officials are expected to make extensive presentations on plans to assume responsibility of security from NATO-led forces over the next three years and efforts to forge a political settlement with the Taliban, which some see as key to establishing security across the country. Yet even with Afghanistan's ambitious plans to become self-sufficient in political and security matters, few expect it will be truly independent -- especially economically -- beyond the 2014 transition. World Bank and American analyses state that the security situation will be pivotal to Afghanistan's ability to grow its economy. They estimate the withdrawal of troops and a resulting loss of foreign aid could reduce Afghanistan's growth rate by 50% or more -- something the World Bank warned could cause the Afghan economy to collapse. The U.S. has introduced its own plan, developed in coordination with the Afghan government, to shore up the Afghan economy. Washington hopes that increasing investment in Afghanistan's private sector and developing the country's agricultural and mining sectors will help the nation become less reliant on the United States. U.S. officials acknowledge that it will be difficult for Afghanistan to make more progress economically, unless the governance and security situations improve. There are also other challenges, like the fact Afghanistan still ranks among the world's lowest literacy and health rates -- factors that make it difficult to find skilled laborers need to fuel industry. Another problem is the state of Afghanistan's infrastructure. One focus is to integrate Afghanistan's economy with its neighbors in south and central Asia, thus bolstering Afghanistan's self-sufficiency. To that end, the United States has introduced the New Silk Road initiative to promote Afghanistan as a hub for the free movement of goods, services, capital and people in the region. The elephant in the room at Bonn -- or, more accurately, not in the room -- will be neighboring Pakistan. Islamabad opted not to send any representatives to the conference last week in reaction to November 27 cross-border strike by NATO that killed 24 of its soldiers. It has also closed NATO supply lines into Afghanistan in retaliation for the attack. Pakistan is viewed as a critical player in the region, because of its perceived relationships with the Taliban and other insurgency groups -- some of whom are based within Pakistani borders, from where they launch attacks on Afghan and foreign troops. Pakistan's government, itself, has argued for a larger role in regional efforts to stabilize the country and broker peace with the Taliban. Washington had hoped the Bonn conference would produce momentum for peace talks with the Taliban, but reconciliation efforts have stalled since the September assassination of Burhanuddin Rabbani, a former Afghan president who was his government's chief negotiator in talks with insurgents. Those efforts have been further stymied by Pakistan's decision not to go to Germany. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who arrived in Bonn on Sunday night, has called Pakistan's decision to drop out of the conference ""regrettable"" and even called Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani to ask his government to reconsider. Still, U.S. officials -- at least publicly -- refuse to admit Pakistan will play spoiler either at the Bonn conference or in the larger U.S.-led plans to stabilize Afghanistan and bring forces home.","Diplomats and NGO leaders meet this week in Germany to talk about Afghanistan .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- At least three people were killed and 30 injured in an explosion near the governor's compound in the city of Lashkar Gah in southern Afghanistan Thursday, authorities said. A suicide bomber driving a car apparently targeted a foreign armored convoy outside the town's education department, said Daoud Ahmadi, a spokesman for the governor, who added that three women were among the injured. A spokeswoman for the British Foreign Office said three British nationals who were near the governor's compound were injured when the blast went off. Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who's currently in Europe, condemned the attack, a presidential spokesman said.","Three British nationals were wounded in the attack, an official says .

"(CNN) -- British researchers say a new drug could effectively halt the progression of Alzheimer's disease, offering hope to millions. The pioneering research -- a joint initiative between the University of Aberdeen in the UK and Singapore-based TauRx Therapeutics -- was announced this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (ICAD 2008) in Chicago. The product -- remberTM -- is the first drug to act on the ""tangles"" discovered by Alois Alzheimer over a century ago. Tangles are made up of the protein, tau, which forms inside nerve cells in the brain. According to Aberdeen University, the drug works by dissolving these tau fibers to prevent a build up of tangles which destroy nerve cells and neurons critical for memory. Trials were carried out on 321 people with mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease in the UK and Singapore. Patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease were given either 30, 60 or 100mg of the drug or a placebo. The 60mg dose produced the most pronounced effect, with those with both mild and moderate Alzheimer's experiencing an 81 percent reduction in mental decline after 50 weeks. Those on rember did not experience a significant decline in their mental function over 19 months, while those on placebo got worse. Brain imaging data also showed that the drug had its biggest effect in the memory critical parts of the brain where the tangle density is highest. In a statement on the university's Web site, Professor Claude Wischik, Chairman of TauRx Therapeutics and Professor of Psychiatric Geratology and Old Age Psychiatry at the University of Aberdeen's Institute of Medical Sciences, who led the research, said: ""This is an unprecedented result in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. ""We have demonstrated for the first time that it may possible to arrest the progression of this disease by targeting the tangles which are highly correlated with the disease."" Professor Clive Ballard, head of research at the Alzheimer's Society, told the British Press Association: ""This is a major new development in the fight against dementia. ""It suggests the drug could be over twice as affective as any treatment that is currently available."" If further trials prove successful, the drug could be available by 2012.","Announced at Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Chicago .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Cairo braced for a third day of protests despite stifling heat Monday, as Egyptians vent anger over the trials of former top officials accused of ordering demonstrators killed during last year's revolution. Former President Hosni Mubarak and his Interior Minister Habib El Adly were sentenced to life in prison, while six top interior ministry officials were cleared of the charges. Protesters flooded into Cairo's Tahrir Square, the symbolic heart of Egypt's revolution, in the wake of the verdict, outraged at the clearing of the ministry officials and angry that Mubarak escaped the death penalty. The protesters chanted ""Down with SCAF,"" the military council that has ruled the country since Mubarak was toppled last year, and shouted that the court ruling was illegitimate. There were smaller protests on Sunday, and vows to continue demonstrations on Monday. Protesters rally after Egypt's Hosni Mubarak is sentenced to life in prison . Mubarak and his two sons, Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, were cleared of corruption charges on Saturday, but the sons now face two other sets of charges. On Sunday, prosecutors announced the two are charged with money laundering. Last week, they were charged with insider trading, accused of making a profit of 2 billion Egyptian pounds -- about $331 million -- through the practice on the Egyptian stock market. Hosni Mubarak has previously accused authorities of tarnishing his reputation and that of his family. He has said he and his children did not violate any laws. Five of Mubarak's aides have been freed; Gamal and Alaa Mubarak remain in prison. Adel Saeed, spokesman for the general prosecutor's office, said last week the two sons would remain in prison for the insider trading case. It was not immediately clear what impact the new charges of money laundering, would have on how long the two remain behind bars. Many Egyptians taking part in Sunday's protests expressed anger that former strongman Mubarak, 84, had escaped the death penalty. A cartoon published after the verdict showed Mubarak's scowling head in prison while his body, hands dripping with blood and labeled ""Mubarak's regime,"" walked away waving a sheet of paper saying ""innocent."" The Muslim Brotherhood called for more protests on Sunday. Mubarak was immediately transferred to a prison in southern Cairo to serve his sentence, and a prosecutor said the former president, who attended court on a gurney, would be moved to the prison hospital. The former president's lawyer, Fareed El Deeb, said there were many holes in the judge's decision and that he was already preparing to appeal the Mubarak verdict. Protesters in the square waved Egyptian flags as they demanded justice for those killed and injured during last year's demonstrations. At least 61 people were injured Saturday in protests throughout Egypt, following the verdict, state TV reported. iReport: Egyptians protest current regime . About 840 people died and more than 6,000 others were injured in last year's 18-day uprising, according to Amnesty International. ""I'm asking the help of the people who gather in Tahrir Square to get justice for my son,"" pleaded one woman on the street in Cairo. ""I need justice for my son. My son did not commit any crime. How come the sons of Mubarak are set free?"" The Cairo courtroom erupted in chaos Saturday after the judge announced his decisions. It appeared the entire gallery of men dressed in suits began shouting and stood on their chairs. Fists flew and at least one man suffered a bleeding gash to his chin. ""We want honesty!"" they shouted. ""Revolution till victory!"" A strongman's fall from grace . The echoing cheers outside the police academy where the trial was held turned to angry shouts as people first heard Mubarak's sentence, then heard that all of Mubarak's senior advisers and his two sons were acquitted. The mostly anti-Mubarak crowd threw rocks at police, smashed cars and cursed the ruling military council. The sentence delivered by Judge Ahmed Refaat was the final chapter of Mubarak's iron rule of Egypt that ended in February 2011. He said it offered people relief after living ""in 30 years of dark without any hope."" ""The verdicts are insults to the Egyptian people and the judicial system. It's a festival of innocent verdicts to El Adly's aides who killed and tortured free citizens for years,"" said Rami Shath, a member of the Egyptian Revolution Alliance. Human Rights Watch said the verdict sends a message to Egypt's future leaders that they are not above the law, though it said the acquittals give ""a green light to future police abuse."" Amnesty International described the verdict as ""a significant step towards combating long-standing impunity in Egypt"" but it too said the ruling leaves many waiting for full justice. Arab leaders: Where are they now? David Scheffer, an American lawyer and diplomat who served as the first U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues, said the trial was significant for the Arab world even if it could have been run better. ""While I want to emphasize the problems with the trial itself, it's also important to recognize that the Egyptian judicial system has held a leader accountable for very serious crimes that occurred during the uprising in Egypt,"" Scheffer told CNN. ""In the very heart of the Arab world, where this has not occurred before in a civilian court, a leader has actually been brought to justice, a leader who has been present in the courtroom has brought to some level of justice by a domestic court for gross human rights abuses."" Timeline of Mubarak's ascent and fall from power . The White House had no comment on Mubarak's sentence. The trial has been a spectacle few Egyptians thought they would see, with Mubarak on the gurney and locked in a defendant's cage. The verdict follows Friday's expiration of a notorious emergency law that had been in effect since shortly after Mubarak came to power in October 1981 and gave police sweeping powers. CNN's Saad Abedine and Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","Demonstrators vow to continue protests despite stifling heat in Cairo .

"Joplin, Missouri (CNN) -- The tornado that struck Joplin, Missouri, Sunday killed 124 people, authorities said Tuesday, in what was the deadliest single U.S. tornado since modern record-keeping began 61 years ago. An estimated 750 people have been treated at area hospitals, said Joplin City Manager Mark Rohr, who told residents of the tornado-ravaged town to be prepared in case a new wave of destructive storms strikes. A tornado warning was issued, then canceled, Tuesday night for Joplin. The storm involved likely will pass well north of the city, said forecasters. They predicted Joplin could still get hit by strong wind gusts of more than 70 miles per hour. On a brighter note, rescue workers pulled two more people alive from the rubble within the last 24 hours, Rohr said. Also Tuesday, forecasters raised their assessment of the Sunday storm, ranking it at the top of the scale used to rate tornadoes. The National Weather Service has determined the twister packed top winds of more than 200 mph, making it a 5 on the enhanced Fujita scale, said Bill Davis, the meteorologist who reviewed the damage. Davis said the tornado left ""about six miles of total destruction"" in its wake. Examinations of some of the buildings destroyed or damaged convinced forecasters to raise the designation, he said. Roughly 8,000 structures within the city of Joplin were damaged, Rohr said, citing a Federal Emergency Management Agency report. A previous estimate had put the number of buildings damaged or destroyed at 2,000. Among the dead in Joplin were 10 residents and a staff member at a nursing home, a company official said. Two other staffers at Greenbriar Nursing Home are in critical condition at a hospital, said the home's vice president, Bill Mitchell. Of the other 79 residents of the home, all but one are accounted for, he said. Only rubble remains and survivors have been moved to temporary housing or are with family members. ""It just looks like a war zone,"" said Eddie Atwood in a CNN iReport from the scene. From where he stood, Atwood said, ""You could see all the way to the horizon because all the houses and all the trees were just leveled."" ""I was walking down Main Street. Everything was so razed over, it was disorienting because some of the streets -- you couldn't even tell where you were at. After living in Joplin all my life it was like living in the twilight zone."" Joplin is not in the clear yet as far as weather goes: The National Weather Service warned there is a chance of another tornado outbreak -- with the peak time ending at midnight Tuesday -- over a wide swath including parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Nebraska and Missouri. Already Tuesday evening, at least four people were killed and many more injured when a deadly string of tornadoes and thunderstorms cut through central Oklahoma, officials said. Joplin Police Chief Lane Roberts said the city was imposing a curfew Tuesday night in areas struck by the tornado to head off the threat of looting. ""The sole function is to reduce the opportunity for people to loot and steal, and we're hoping the folks who live in that area will cooperate with us,"" he said. President Barack Obama announced he will visit the region on Sunday. ""We are going to do absolutely everything we can to make sure they recover,"" he said during a visit to London. Obama added that he will let people know ""the whole country is going to be behind them."" ""We are here for you. We're going to stay by you,"" Obama said. Richard Serino, the second-highest-ranking official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Monday that Obama had issued a disaster declaration -- expediting the dispersal of federal resources to the area -- while vowing that ""we are going to be here for the long haul."" City Manager Rohr told reporters Tuesday that more than 40 agencies were on the ground in the southwest Missouri city, and two first responders were struck by lightning Monday as they braved relentless rain and high wind searching for survivors. ""One, fortunately, walked away from it; the other one's still in the hospital, last I heard,"" Joplin Emergency Management Director Keith Stammer said on CNN's ""American Morning."" About 1,500 people are still unaccounted for. But ""when we open up the area and start letting them come back in ... that number of unaccounted for will start to dwindle,"" Stammer said. Many of those 1,500 have scattered because of tornado damage and communication problems. Joplin Fire Chief Mitch Randles said the second search and rescue effort basically follows the tornado's path. ""We're searching every structure that's been damaged or destroyed in a more in-depth manner,"" he said. ""The third search is going to be similar to that. And then the fourth search through will be with the search-and-rescue dogs."" Authorities encouraged people to use the website safeandwell.org, operated by the Red Cross, for updates on loved ones. Some residents said the tornado struck suddenly. ""It all happened so fast,"" Rachael Neff said on CNN's ""American Morning"" Tuesday. ""It seemed like forever but it happened very fast."" ""We had a few minutes' warning. I've never taken any of the warnings seriously but something snapped in me and I put blankets and pillows in the bathroom. We were running to the bathroom. You could hear the home shaking, everything busting out."" Neff, her fiance, Zac Bronson, and her toddler prayed, screamed and survived. ""We've had a tremendous support system. Our employers, friends and family have been more than helpful and we move on and rebuild. We just start another life. We started a new life,"" Bronson said. By Monday night, officials found 17 people alive. But many, including Will Norton, remain missing. The 18-year-old was driving home from his high school graduation Sunday when the tornado destroyed the Hummer H3 he and his father were in. ""We were in a separate car. We were about 30 seconds in front of them, one block,"" Norton's sister, Sara, told CNN. ""My dad called and he said, 'Open the garage door.' ... And then I just heard him say, 'Pull over, Will. Pull over.' And then they started flipping."" ""My dad said -- when my dad gained consciousness, he said that he saw my brother -- his seat belt snapped and he was ejected through the sunroof,"" she added. The family has been tracking a ""Help Find Will Norton"" Facebook page and pursuing leads on his whereabouts. Norton's aunt, Tracey, said the family received a tip that the teen was listed on a local hospital's emergency room roster -- but she's not sure where he is now. ""They transferred him, but we're not sure where he was transferred,"" the aunt said. ""When he was transferred, he was alive. We don't know anything other than that."" The tornado that carved through the city of about 50,000 on Sunday is the deadliest to hit American soil since the National Weather Service began keeping records 61 years ago. The National Weather Service notes seven deadlier twisters, but says those took place ""before the years of comprehensive damage surveys,"" so they may have been the result of multiple tornadoes. But the Weather Service does say that the Great Tri-State Tornado of 1925, which tore across southeast Missouri, southern Illinois and southwest Indiana, killed 695 people -- ""a record for a single tornado."" A 1953 twister in Flint, Michigan, killed 116 people, according to the Weather Service. Last month, two fatal twisters struck Alabama. One hit Hackleburg and the town of Phil Campbell, killing 78 people, and another struck Tuscaloosa and Birmingham, killing 61. With crews still sifting through rubble, the death toll could continue to climb. ""I think the more time that goes by, the more I feel sick about it,"" Sarah Hale, a lifelong Joplin resident, said Tuesday. ""These people are cold and sick and stuck. As the days go on, and the death toll goes up, how many funerals are we going to go to?"" Joplin Mayor Mike Woolston said Monday night that his community hasn't given up. ""We hope that there are people alive. We have a number of apartment buildings, complexes that are almost completely flattened. So we anticipate finding more people, and hopefully we'll get there in time to find them alive,"" he said. The tornado chewed through a densely populated area of the city, eliminating a high school and making a direct hit on one of the two hospitals in the city. Woolston pledged not to let the tornado ruin his city. ""This is just not the type of community that's going to let a little F-4 tornado kick our ass. So we will rebuild, and we will recover."" CNN's Chuck Johnston, Joe Sutton, Greg Botelho, Holly Yan, Marlena Baldacci, Mike Pearson, Jessica Jordan, Sean Morris and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: A tornado warning is issued, then canceled, for Joplin .

"(CNET) -- Just how reliant are you on the Internet? More women would give up sex rather than go without Internet access, according to a new survey. Nearly half of the women questioned by Harris Interactive said they'd be willing to forgo sex for two weeks, rather than give up their Internet access, according to a study released Monday by Intel, which commissioned the survey. While 46 percent of the women surveyed were willing to engage in abstinence versus losing their Internet, only 30 percent of the men surveyed were willing to do likewise. The U.S. survey, which queried 2,119 adults last month, found that the gap grew even wider for both men and woman who were 18 to 34 years old. For woman, the percentage of those willing to skip the sheets in favor of the Web rose to 49 percent, while it climbed to 39 percent for men. And for women 35 to 44 years old, the figure jumped to 52 percent. (Results as of Monday from CNET's related online poll showed that 30.5 percent of respondents would give up sex for one year, while 26.1 percent would do without Internet access for a year. Almost 40 percent of voters didn't want to sacrifice either.) These figures were just some of the tidbits that came out of the Intel's broader commissioned study on Americans' reliance on the Internet in today's economy. Though not as sexy but equally interesting, the survey also found that 87 percent of respondents said the Internet saves them money. Specifically, 84 percent of those surveyed found the Internet saved them money by comparing prices online and searching out the best deals, while 65 percent said it aided them in finding coupons, discounts, and special promotions. And TV, which has been losing its share of eyeball time to the Internet over the years, found that the majority of adults would be willing to forgo two weeks of watching TV versus losing one week on the Internet. Of course when it comes to TV, perhaps size matters, at least according to a different survey earlier this year of Britons conducted by electronics retailer Comet. Almost half of the men polled said they would give up sex for six months in return for a 50-inch plasma TV, according to Reuters. That compared with just over a third of women who were willing to make the same sacrifice for the big-screen television. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- The suspect in Norway's July 22 terror attacks has told police he had plans to attack other targets, Norwegian police said Saturday. Anders Behring Breivik was interrogated Friday for the second time since his arrest, which followed the bombing of Oslo government buildings in which eight people died and a shooting rampage on an island which killed 69. Police declined to say what the other targets were. They also offered no comment when asked about reports that Norway's royal palace and the Labour Party headquarters were targets. The new details emerged during an interrogation of the suspect that lasted almost 10 hours, police attorney Pal-Frederick Hjort Kraby told reporters. Breivik was ""more than willing to co-operate"" with officers questioning him, and was calm and willing to explain himself, Kraby said. The first part of the interview focused on going back over what he had told police the first time he was questioned, a week ago, Kraby said. Then police questioned him about his movements in the government area of central Oslo before, during and after the bomb blast there, the attorney said. His answers will be checked against footage from video cameras in the area, Kraby added, as police seek to make sure he was not working with anyone else. Individuals who have been in contact with the suspect will also be of interest to police, the lawyer said. His mother has been formally interviewed. Breivik is expected to be interviewed many more times in the weeks ahead, with investigators likely to ask more questions rather than just letting him talk, Kraby said. Breivik is being kept in solitary confinement at Ila Prison, near Oslo, which held prisoners of the Nazis during World War II. His sole contacts are with his lawyer and prison staffers who take food to him. Breivik has admitted carrying out the bombing in Oslo, in which eight people died, and the shootings on Utoya, his lawyer and a judge have said. He has also pleaded not guilty in court. The attack on Utoya targeted members of the Labour Party's youth movement as they attended a summer camp. On Friday, Norwegian authorities completed the identification of the dead, releasing the names of all 77. Their ages ranged from 14 to 61, with an average age of 21. Earlier Friday, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, other political leaders and relatives of the victims attended a memorial service organized by the Labour Party youth movement to commemorate those killed and wounded.","Breivik has told interrogators he planned to attack more targets .

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- The last place Kathy Archuleta could have ever imagined she'd spend the first night of the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, was at a happy hour sponsored by the Republican Party. Clinton supporters chat at the RNC sponsored Hillary Happy Hour Monday night in Denver, Colorado. But the 54-year-old Democrat joined several other Hillary Clinton supporters, along with volunteers and officials from John McCain's campaign, at a Happy Hour for Hillary. The event, sponsored by the Republican National Committee and approved by the McCain campaign, was a chance for McCain and Clinton supporters to come together for one cause: their opposition to Barack Obama's candidacy. ""Four years ago, if you said we'd be at a Hillary happy hour at the DNC, I would have called you crazy. But today is a great opportunity for people who ... agree that Sen. Barack Obama doesn't have the experience to be president of the United States,"" said McCain campaign regional communications director Tom Kise. As Michelle Obama was delivering her ""One Nation"" unity speech on the convention floor several blocks away, more than 100 people gathered at the Paramount Café in downtown Denver. In a side room, both groups of supporters discussed politics, sports and the convention while sipping cocktails and munching on tacos and a cheese spread. But there was nothing unified for these Clinton supporters who walked across the aisle or, in this case, the cafe Monday night. Archuleta, who hails from Denver, has been a registered Democrat all her life -- until now. ""I'm a registered Republican ... for the first time in my voting life,"" Archuleta said. ""No Obama for me. I'm voting for John McCain."" ""He reminds me of what the Jimmy Carter era was like. ... If they think Jimmy Carter had it bad, just wait if Obama gets into the White House. That will be bad news in so many ways,"" she added. Obama's relative lack of experience in national politics -- long seen as his Achilles heel -- was something that Clinton supporters, Republicans and independents attending the happy hour rallied behind. ""His lack of experience has been demonstrated so painfully every time he opens his mouth just about. ... You cannot have good judgment without experience; that's how you get it,"" said 58-year-old Marnie Delano of New York. Adam Edwards, a 20-year-old Clinton supporter, said that although the New York senator ""was the stronger candidate,"" voters may have ""just discredited her because of some imagined baggage she carried from her husband's administration."" Leland Kritt, a McCain supporter who made his way to Denver from Los Angeles, California, said Obama's message of 'change' is simply flawed. ""The simple fact remains, change will occur anyway, no matter who the president is. For every man, woman and child, change will happen. Question is: who is best able to handle that change?"" the 51-year-old Republican said. The McCain campaign has been aggressively courting Clinton's voters in recent days, especially after Obama announced Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden as his running mate Saturday. Shortly after the announcement, the Arizona senator's campaign released a TV ad in several swing states that used video of Biden criticizing Obama as too inexperienced to be president. And just as the Democrats' convention was getting started in Denver, both the McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee unveiled four TV ads geared toward Clinton supporters. The most recent McCain ad involves the famous Hillary Clinton ""3 a.m."" spot and will be aired during the convention. The 30-second spot uses footage from Clinton's original ad and declares, ""Hillary's right."" The ad, set to run in key battleground states and specifically in Denver this week, also goes a step further than the New York senator's original ad, explicitly detailing the national security threats America faces. Clinton, speaking to member of the New York delegation in Denver on Monday, said she was opposed to Republicans using her words against Obama. Meanwhile, a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll taken August 23-24 found that 56 percent of registered voters have a favorable opinion of Hillary Clinton, with 40 percent having an unfavorable view. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. iReport.com: Are you in Denver? So while Clinton's die-hard supporters are in Denver in full force, the poll showed that her negative approval rating is very high among registered voters nationwide. But there is some bad news for Obama. The poll showed that 66 percent of Clinton supporters -- registered Democrats who want Clinton as the nominee -- are now backing Obama. That's down from 75 percent in the end of June. Twenty-seven percent of them now say they'll support McCain, up from 16 percent in late June. And nowhere was that statistic more prevalent than at the RNC-sponsored happy hour for Hillary. Clinton supporters-turned-McCain converts at the event were not just angry at Obama's campaign; they're furious with the Democratic Party's nomination process this year. ""The DNC really pushed [Barack Obama] on us. Now they've left us with two choices: somebody who has no substance or a Republican,"" said Jessi Cleaver, 35, of New York. ""And these are terrible choices, and they worked hard to select this candidate. ... We're watching the DNC pick this candidate for us."" It's a point Mitt Marr agreed with. ""We're taking a stand and not backing down. It's 'we the people,' not 'we the DNC.' We are standing up for what is right. I know in my heart,"" said the woman from Sugar Land, Texas, who would give her age only as 50-something. As the convention heats up and tensions remain high over how to make sure Clinton's 18 million or so votes are counted, supporters will rally by her side, even if their pick in November is her enemy.","The Republican Party held a happy hour for Hillary Clinton backers in Denver .

"Washington (CNN) -- Promises are an inherent part of campaigning. But in a time where distrust of government is at an all-time high, 2012 Republican candidates are using promises of action on Day 1 of their administrations to convince voters of the seriousness of the problems facing the nation and their seriousness about taking immediate action to fix them. For the most part, the campaigns have focused on using executive orders as a means to do something on the first day. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich outlines on his website the content of the executive order he would sign in his first day in office. He promises to eliminate all White House ""czar"" positions, reauthorize a policy to stop ""taxpayer dollars from being used to fund or promote abortions in foreign countries"" and to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, among other things. Gingrich says all of these would be done using executive orders -- and promises they will all be online by October. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has also been specific with what he would do through executive orders, laying out a plan for five of them to be signed on his first day in the White House. Romney pledges to ""return maximum possibly authority to states,"" in regard to health care and ""immediately initiate the elimination of Obama-era regulations that unduly burden the economy."" Additionally, Romney has said he would use an executive order to direct the Department of the Interior to increase the number of drilling permits issued in the United States. There is a certain level of vagueness, however, from both Gingrich and Romney about their plans. In January, Gingrich promised a crowd in Tampa to ""repeal every Obama attack on religion."" Additionally, Romney does not say how he will return power to the states or what level of scrutiny these new drilling permits will receive. ""These types of promises can be very specific,"" said Jeffrey Toobin, CNN senior legal analyst. ""This is a good thing if you believe the politicians should make accountable promises."" First-day use of executive orders has become the norm in modern politics. ""Most presidents have a list of executive orders that they want to have ready for signature on the first day of office,"" Toobin said. On January 21, 2009, President Barack Obama issued two executive orders and three presidential memorandums aimed at government transparency and ethics. In his first full day in office the new president froze the salaries of his senior aides, demanded the government disclose more information and authorized new limits on lobbyists' access to lawmakers. Texas Congressman Ron Paul has said in interviews that the country's problems are currently too large to be fixed in one day, but he has said he would start with foreign policy and ""bring the troops home,"" so they can spend their money here. Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said in July that his first action as president would be to ""sign an executive order to repeal Obamacare."" Additionally, Santorum has outlined executive orders to reverse regulations on business and reinstitute the Mexico City Policy to stop taxpayer funding or promotion of abortions overseas. For all candidates, it is important to note that an executive order cannot overrule a law passed by the Senate and House and signed by a former president. Therefore, though a candidate may want to abolish the Affordable Care Act with the stroke of a pen, it would take a full-fledged bill to do that. And that stipulation has not been overlooked by some campaigns. ""I will ask members of Congress to stay in session. On January 3rd, I will ask them first repeal Obamacare,"" Gingrich said at a Florida event in January. ""I will also ask them to stay in session and repeal the Dodd-Frank bill, which is killing banks. Third â€” I will ask them to repeal the Sarbanes-Oxley bill,"" which was enacted in the wake of the Enron, WorldCom and other corporate scandals. In conjunction with his first day executive orders, Gingrich says that by the time Obama ""arrives back in Chicago,"" the Gingrich administration would have dismantled 40% of Obama's government. Not to be outdone, Romney has pledged, via congressional bill, to reduce the corporate income tax by 25% and would cut non-security discretionary spending by 5%. Additionally he would ""consolidate the sprawl of federal retraining programs and return funding and responsibility for these programs to the states."" All of these promises begs the question -- is there even enough time on Day 1 to get this much done? In short, yes, says Anita McBride, former adviser to President George W. Bush and chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush. But McBride cautioned about how busy Inauguration Day can be. It takes an effective transition team to make consequential first day orders a reality, said McBride. McBride, who helped with multiple transitions while working for three presidents, says the day starts with an early morning briefing on national security that lays out the responsibilities that fall on the then president-elect once he is sworn in. Following that, the president-elect has coffee with the sitting president. Then there are the more notable events -- the inauguration speech, lunch in the Capitol and the parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. It isn't all pomp and circumstance, however. After being sworn in, the president will have an opportunity to tend to critical business. ""There is a room at the Capitol that is behind the cloak room on the House floor that is used only on the day that presidents are inaugurated,"" McBride said. ""What happens immediately after being sworn in is the president signs Cabinet appointments that have to happen right away."" McBride went on to say that if a transition team had prepared the executive orders, this would be the perfect time for the new president to make his first decisions in office. So could a president sign five bills and pass five executive orders in a day? ""It is perfectly within reason,"" concluded Toobin. ""It just depends on how motivated they are to do these things."" ""This is the next four to eight years of their life -- they have to do it all,"" said McBride. ""Absolutely it is possible.""","Campaigns focus on using executive orders as a means to do something on the first day .

"Madison, Wisconsin (CNN) -- In the canon of political cliches, ""it all comes down to turnout"" is among the most tired. But in the case of the polarizing and closely watched Wisconsin recall election, the maxim happens to ring true. Public polling, internal polling and campaign strategists all tell the same story: Republican Gov. Scott Walker is clinging to a tiny lead over his Democratic opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, heading into Tuesday's vote. And the number of undecided voters has dwindled to almost zero, strategists in both parties say, meaning that the only mission left for both sides is to get their rabid supporters to the polls. ""Our sole focus right now is on our grassroots get-out-the-vote-effort,"" said Ben Sparks, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Republican Party. The final blitz began over the weekend. ""We Are Wisconsin,"" an umbrella group funded by labor unions and the Democratic Governors Association, said it contacted nearly 750,000 voters over the weekend, with the goal of touching 1.4 million people with phone calls or door knocks by the close of polls Tuesday. Meanwhile, the state GOP and the Republican National Committee, which are coordinating some of their efforts with the Walker campaign, boasted Monday that they have identified and contacted 4 million voters since January -- a number that has national Republicans speculating that they can put the state in play for Mitt Romney in November. The recall fight has its roots in Walker's successful push in early 2011 to strip public employees of their collective bargaining rights in an effort to close an ugly budget shortfall. The push sparked a bitter partisan battle between Walker and Democrats in the state legislature, and set off a wave of historic protests from union members inside and outside the state capitol in Madison. After Walker signed the controversial budget bill in March 2011, labor organizers subsequently managed to collect 900,000 certified signatures to trigger a recall and are now among those leading the final get-out-the-vote push. On Monday, at a Madison-area branch of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), Barrett supporters spent the day popping in to pick up fliers for door-to-door voter contact efforts. The union is also paying for cab rides to the polls on Tuesday. Randy Case, a retiree from Cross Plains, was among those who dropped by the AFSCME office to help. He said Walker deserves to be removed from office because he trampled on Wisconsin's cherished tradition of fair play in state government. ""This is a friendly state,"" Case said. ""People get along here, and I think in our government, that has meant we elect people who work across the aisle and listen to other side. And that has just been absent with this current administration. It's 'my way or the highway,' which is simply not a Wisconsin value. It's not how we govern ourselves."" Walker argues that his reforms are working, pointing to a projected budget surplus and a modest uptick in jobs since he took office last year. Democrats have tried to poke holes in those numbers, but according to recent poll from Marquette University Law School, a slight majority of voters approve of Walker's performance in Madison. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Barrett's hometown paper, also came to Walker's defense with a helpful messaging point last week, writing in an editorial that the governor deserves to finish his term. Walker is not the only Republican facing a recall Tuesday. Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch is on the ballot against Democrat Mahlon Mitchell, a Fitchburg firefighter dubbed ""M&M"" by some of his supporters. The undercard also features four of the Republican state senators who helped Walker pass his budget reforms. Just one GOP loss in those recall races would flip control of the state Senate back to Democrats, at least until the next election in November. But the marquee race is between Walker and Barrett, a rematch of the 2010 governor's race. In that historically Republican year, Walker edged Barrett in their original matchup by 5 points. Different dynamics are at work on Tuesday, though, giving Democrats some hope even though Walker is considered the narrow favorite. While the anti-Walker fervor may have waned since protests consumed the state capitol grounds in early 2011, insiders here predict that turnout on both sides is likely to be higher than it was for the original Walker-Barrett race. But even in the race's eleventh hour, strategists in both parties are struggling to figure out whether turnout will be closer to 2008 levels, when nearly 70% of eligible Wisconsin voters participated in the presidential election, or 2010, when voter turnout dropped to 49%. Democrats are hoping for the 2008 model. Almost 3 million people voted in that election, and the state went heavily for Barack Obama. ""It was a low turnout in 2010 and a high turnout in 2008,"" said former Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold, who spent Monday traveling the state rallying Democrats. ""If we get anywhere near 2008 or even halfway there, we are going to win, because those folks are more likely to vote for Tom Barrett."" But unlike 2008, when Republican turnout underwhelmed, Wisconsin voters on both sides are now engaged at a level not seen in recent memory. ""We have an example of Hatfields and McCoys going on in this state like we have never seen,"" said Brian Nemoir, a Milwaukee-based Republican strategist. ""People are hyper-engaged, as much in support for their own candidate as in disgust for the opponent."" Handmade signs are nearly as prevalent as official ones. Some locals say they have resorted to lowering their voices in public when discussing the recall to avoid setting off arguments with strangers. The Marquette University poll revealed that 26% of all voters have slapped a bumper sticker on their car or planted a sign in their lawn. The same survey found that a third of voters have simply stopped talking politics with someone they know because the race is so heated. And this is all in a state with a historical reputation for collegiality and Midwestern politeness. A flood of campaign money, much of it from out-of-state interest groups and most of it benefiting Republicans, is partially responsible for the hothouse political climate. About $64 million has been spent on the race since November 2011, an analysis from the Center for Public Integrity found. That's a new state record, shattering the previous record of $37.4 million spent during the 2010 governor's race. Beginning last fall, Walker seized on a loophole in Wisconsin law that allows incumbents in recall elections to raise unlimited sums. Walker outraised his opponent by an almost 8-1 margin, collecting $30.5 million to Barrett's $4 million. Roughly two-thirds of Walker's contributions came from out of state, the Center for Public Integrity reported, while only a quarter of Barrett's funds originated from outside Wisconsin. Beyond the individual campaigns, independent groups have played a major role in the race, helping saturate television and radio airwaves with negative advertising. The Republican Governors Association, for instance, has spent more than $8 million on Walker's behalf, most it on television ads. Working against Walker are unions like AFSCME, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association and the Service Employees International Union, which have also steered millions of dollars to the state in their efforts to unseat the governor.","Democratic groups say they contacted nearly 750,000 voters over the weekend .

"(CNN) -- Convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout was sentenced Thursday to 25 years behind bars by a federal judge in New York. ""I am not guilty,"" Bout said through a translator. ""I never intended to kill anyone. I never intended to sell any arms to anyone. God knows this is the truth."" Last year Bout, who was dubbed ""the merchant of death"" by his accusers, was convicted on four counts of conspiracy to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles and provide material support to a terrorist organization. He had faced the possibility of life in prison. ""Viktor Bout has been international arms trafficking enemy number one for many years, arming some of the most violent conflicts around the globe,"" said Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. ""He was finally brought to justice in an American court for agreeing to provide a staggering number of military-grade weapons to an avowed terrorist organization committed to killing Americans."" Bout's wife, Alla, said after the hearing that her husband ""said few words"" in reaction to the sentence. ""The war is not lost yet,"" Alla Bout said, speaking in Russian. She said she and her husband could see each other once a week and ""yesterday we had a very serious conversation regarding him speaking in court -- there was a very long speech written ... Viktor together with his defense decided that he did not have anyone to prove himself to in that courtroom or accept his guilt or say anything else regarding the reliability of this case because he did not accept this case from the beginning as a lawful case, starting from the process in Thailand to his extradition to United States."" At the trial, the prosecution said that during a 2008 sting operation by U.S. drug enforcement agents in Thailand, Bout believed he was selling weapons to Colombian guerrillas. His lawyer, Albert Dayan, filed a letter last week asking Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, who presided over the trial and who set Bout's sentence, to set aside the guilty verdict. Dayan urged the judge not to ""become an unwilling party"" in what he called a ""wrongful prosecution"" for ""purely political reasons."" He argued that the conviction is a ""product of malice"" and that Bout has been an ""object of private politics"" coming from Washington. The lawyer claimed that Bout was picked out by the United States government and lured into a crime manufactured by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, in which the agency played ""the role of judge, jury and executioner. "" In his claim, Dayan insisted that Bout did not intend to sell any arms to the agents, that he had not sold any arms for several years and that the only thing he wanted to sell were two cargo airplanes, worth $5 million. Dayan stood by the claim that DEA officers baited his client into illegal activities. ""I do not profess, I do not argue that he's an angel, but he is innocent of these charges,"" Dayan wrote. ""I felt it was my duty to speak out and let the world know."" According to a federal indictment, Bout was suspected of creating front companies that used his planes to deliver food and medical supplies, as well as arms. After a sting operation in 2008, he was arrested in Thailand and in 2010 was extradited to the United States following a protracted court proceeding. He was convicted in November after a three-week trial in New York. Before his arrest, the DEA had struggled to draw Bout out of his Russian homeland, which is long thought to have sheltered and defended him. Undercover agents met with Bout's associates the world over, from Curacao to Copenhagen, in an attempt to set up a meeting with their target, according to the indictment. The Russian businessman also has been accused of assembling a fleet of cargo planes to traffic military-grade weapons to conflict zones around the world since the 1990s. Allegations of trafficking activities in Liberia prompted U.S. authorities to freeze his American assets in 2004 and prohibited U.S. transactions with him, according to the indictment. Bout has maintained that he operated legitimate businesses and had acted as a mere logistics provider. His exact age is unclear, but he is believed to be in his late 40s or 50s, with his age in dispute because of different passports and documents. The U.S. attorney's office said it had no confirmed age. Critics have accused Bout of providing arms to rebels in several countries and fueling bloody conflicts in places such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. In 2000, then-British Foreign Office official Peter Hain branded him ""Africa's chief merchant of death"" at a time when Bout is believed to have supplied arms to officials in Sierra Leone, a former British colony then embroiled in civil war.

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The numbers tell a small part of the story: Eight dead in a bomb blast. The names that police have released so far reveal a little more. Anne Lise Holter, 51. Tove Ashill Knutsen, 56. Hanna M. Orvik Endresen, 61. Kai Hauge, 32. But a 16-minute video shot in the immediate aftermath of the explosion in Oslo, Norway, brings home the horror of what happened there on July 22 in a completely different way. It's not so much the sight of papers fluttering out of the shattered windows of office buildings, or even the red cables sticking out of the ripped concrete pavement. It's the sounds. The whimpering of a woman near tears moments after the bomb blast. The constant crunch of broken glass underfoot. The urgency in the voices of passersby trying to help the wounded. The insistent alarm bell ringing a three-second warning, pausing as if for breath, and ringing again. And again. And again. And again. And again. And finally, the siren of a single ambulance, long after the explosion that smashed Norway's calm. The video was shot by Johan Christian Tandberg, who was driving through a tunnel under the government building that was the target of the attack when the bomb went off. Authorities have charged Anders Behring Breivik, an apparent right-wing extremist with a hatred of Muslims and multi-culturalism, with setting off the bomb. He's also charged in the shooting deaths of 68 people at a Labour Party youth camp on Utoya island, where he eventually surrendered to police. His lawyer says he admits carrying out the attacks. People all over Norway sat in front of their televisions and cried when they heard the next day how many people had died, and they are still crying, Tandberg told CNN Thursday. What he saw when he came out of the tunnel last week ""looked like a war zone,"" he said, adding that he immediately thought of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States. He grabbed a camera and started filming on the spot. The resulting video shows central Oslo littered with street signs ripped out of the ground by the blast, insulation torn from buildings, and people wandering in shock. He follows a man though a damaged building, looking for wounded people but finding only offices in complete disarray, furniture tossed around and ceiling panels hanging down. Back on the streets, at least one person is seen with a cut on his leg, and several people cluster around another casualty. All the faces in the video are blurred. An emergency services worker makes an urgent-sounding call into a radio. Smoke rises over a building in the near distance. Tree branches litter the ground. A woman weeps. And the alarm bell rings. And rings. And rings.","Johan Christian Tandberg was at the scene when a bomb went off .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Rebels pushed Thursday northward on three fronts toward the coastal cities of al-Zawiya, Aziziya and Sorman, with their ultimate goal being Tripoli, rebel field commander Adel Al-Zintani told CNN. Six rebels died and dozens more were wounded in fighting Wednesday and Thursday, he said. He predicted that the fighters would reach the coastal road that leads to the capital city within days. Zawiya is strategically important because the coastal road through the city is the main supply line from the Tunisian border to areas held by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Regime officials were not available Thursday evening for comment. Fighting was continuing around Misrata, where rebel spokesman Mohamed Ibrahim said the main hospital reported four rebels killed and 54 wounded. Meanwhile, in New York, a spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon said the U.N. secretary-general ""is deeply concerned by reports of the unacceptably large number of civilian casualties as a result of the conflict in Libya."" Ban is urging ""all Libyan parties"" to engage with his special envoy, Abdel-Elah Al-Khatib, ""and respond concretely and positively to the ideas presented to them, in order to end the bloodshed in the country,"" the spokesperson said. His remarks came three days after allegations that a NATO strike in the village of Majer near Zlitan wound up killing 85 civilians --- 33 children, 32 women and 20 men. The Tripoli government called it ""a massaacre"" of civilians; NATO has said its warplanes struck two farms used as a staging point for Gadhafi's forces . ""This is a legitimate target. And by striking it, NATO has reduced pro-Gadhafi forces capabilities to threaten and attack civilians,"" said Col. Roland Lavoie, a spokesman for the NATO operation. ""We do not have evidence of civilian casualties at this stage, although casualties among military personnel, including mercenaries, are very likely due to the nature of the target."" But, on Tuesday, officials from the government in Tripoli escorted international journalists to a mass funeral in Majer, and to the site where the government and residents said the NATO airstrike killed civilians. Journalists saw the bodies of children and women among the dead and wounded at the site of the attack. It was impossible for CNN to confirm the extent of the casualties. A spokesman for the Tripoli government, Musa Ibrahim, called it ""a crime beyond imagination."" For weeks, NATO warplanes have been bombing Zlitan on a daily basis. Meanwhile, rebels have been pressing toward Zlitan's eastern gates from the nearby opposition-held port of Misrata. Speaking to journalists in Majer on Tuesday, Ibrahim accused NATO of bombing Majer to clear the way for rebels to advance on the Gadhafi-controlled city of Zlitan, a few kilometers north. Maj. Gen. Nick Pope, spokesman for the British Ministry of Defence, said Thursday that British aircraft have been in action in recent days ""as part of NATO's mission to protect civilians at risk of attack from Col. Gadhafi's former regime."" The latest operations included British aircraft carrying out precision airstrikes on several sites in and around Zlitan, Pope said in a statement. The report of civilian deaths stirred anger in Washington. ""If such reports are true, it further highlights the increased risks to civilians that has occurred as a result of military intervention in Libya and is further evidence that continued bombing by NATO ... is an inappropriate tool to protect civilians or force Moammar Gadhafi from power,"" wrote Rep. Dennis Kucinich in a letter to Ban. ""How can they continue to cause the deaths of innocent civilians under the color of international law and not be held accountable?"" the Ohio Democrat continued. The changing nature of who controls what in Libya was underscored Thursday by events in Washington, where the Libyan Embassy officially reopened under the control of the Transitional National Council. ""This is a message that Gadhafi can no more rule Libya,"" said Ali Aujali, who was accredited Thursday as head of the Libyan mission. Aujuli said he talked Thursday with State Department officials about the Obama administration's efforts to help the TNC gain access to some $30 billion in frozen Libyan assets. The State Department had ordered the embassy closed in March and expelled diplomats loyal to Gadhafi. Aujali had resigned his post as the Gadhafi regime's ambassador to the United States in February and has since represented the opposition in Washington. The United States on July 15 recognized the rebel movement based in Benghazi as Libya's rightful government. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Elise Labott, Joe Vaccarello, Yasmin Amer and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","NEW: Rebels made headway Thursday northward toward coastal cities near the capital .

"Editor's note: The n-word appears in this piece because CNN feels the context in which it is used is pertinent to the story of James ""Little Man"" Presley. James ""Little Man"" Presley has worked in the cotton fields of Sledge, Mississippi, since he was just 6 years old. SLEDGE, Mississippi (CNN) -- James Presley stands amid chopped cotton, the thick Mississippi mud caked on his well-worn boots. A smile spreads across his face when he talks about voting for Barack Obama and what that might mean for generations to come. His voice picks up a notch. He holds his head up a bit higher. ""There's a heap of pride in voting for a black man,"" he says. At 78, Presley is a legend of the past living in the present and now hopeful for the future. A grandson of slaves, he's one of the few men left in America so closely tied to his slave past, still farming cotton on the same land as his ancestors. He's picked cotton since he was just 6 years old. He and his wife of 57 years, Eva May, raised 13 children and six grandchildren in a cypress-sided house in the middle of cotton fields in northwestern Mississippi. He was a sharecropper most his life, but rarely qualified for food stamps.  Watch ""Obama, he come up like"" » . His father died in 1935 when he was 5, and he had to step up and be the ""Little Man"" of the house, a nickname that has stuck seven decades later. He's lived a raw-knuckled life where hope moved at a molasses-slow pace. The last time he had hope for a better future was four decades ago -- first with President John F. Kennedy and then with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Obama has changed everything to the poor in these parts. iReport.com: What does Obama's presidency mean to you? ""I'm a church man,"" he says. ""And I kind of figured this here is about like it was with Moses with the children of Israel. On that day, when he gets to be president, we're all going to be rejoicing."" Does he have plans to celebrate on Inauguration Day? ""Oh man, it's gonna be nice. I believe we're gonna have a good time,"" he says. ""I never thought one would get there.""  See photos of the weather-beaten home where Little Man raised so many children » . As the nation prepares for Obama's inauguration on January 20, CNN.com traveled to Sledge, Mississippi, a forgotten town of about 500 people in the heart of the Mississippi Delta that some consider to be the birthplace of blues in America. Nearly 20 percent of residents over the age of 60 live below the poverty line, according to the 2000 census. That number nearly doubles, to 37.5 percent, for residents under the age of 19. About three-quarters of the population are black. Two-thirds of the people here make less than $35,000 a year. Presley says the fact the nation will have a black president will have a ripple effect in poor communities like his. For the first time ever, he says, black parents and grandparents can tell youngsters in rural America that through education, anything is possible -- that the White House isn't just for white folks. Three of his children graduated from college. Two have died -- one as a youth, one as an adult. It never gets easier, he says, no matter what age they die. Obama has already brought inspiration to future generations of his own family. ""I might be dead and gone, but it's going to be a good thing to me, because I know that they ain't gotta go through what I went through. They'll have a better time, a more joyous time, than what I had when I come along. It is gonna be grand to them and to me, too."" ""He knows what it is to come up without a father and what it is to come up for what you work for,"" Presley says. ""Me and the poor man coming up, we had to work for what bread I got."" Presley shifts back and forth on his feet as he speaks. His flannel shirt and oil-stained jeans seem befitting of his life on the farm. He peers out from a camouflage hat, the fuzzy ear flaps pulled up over his head. He speaks in an accent as thick as the mud on his boots. His hands speak to decades of hard labor. His fingers appear swollen with overworked muscles. The skin seems about a quarter-inch thick. If his hands could speak, he says, ""They'd be crying, instead of talking, for what they've been through."" ""You see how rusty and rough they are. They've been through something, ain't they?"" At 6-foot, 2-inches and 214 pounds, Presley has what seems an odd nickname. ""They call me Little Man,"" he says. He wears the nickname with pride. The youngest of three sisters and four brothers, he says that after his father died in 1935, he became the ""Little Man"" of the house. ""I was tall, but I was small. So they called me Little Man,"" he says. He doesn't remember much about his father. He can't recall the day he died or the sound of his voice. He was too young. He never met his slave grandparents either. They died long before he was born. But the fact they were slaves still stings. ""That doesn't make you feel too good, you know, to be sold like a cow. But back then, they couldn't help it. So I reckon I'm just glad that things come out better like it is now."" A thick fog hangs over the fields on this day. Presley pauses. He scans the fields and says, ""I think about the good times and the hard times."" ""When I started farming, we planted with hands ... and hauled it to the gin by wagon, a mule and a wagon. One bale at a time,"" he says. He worked the fields when he was 6, the age of a typical kindergartner these days. ""I was making 50 cents a day, from sunup to sundown."" ""Back then, you know, I didn't get no schooling. I had to get out, come home and break the land, cut the stalks, plow the land and get it ready for the crop."" Presley has a total of four years of education, classes that he took in between growing seasons. His mother taught him to read and write, but he admits even to this day he struggles with both. When it comes to life as a black man -- a sharecropper -- in Mississippi, he says it's tough to explain how difficult it was. He points to a nearby bluff and says that when he was just a boy, a black man was lynched from a tree. ""I never saw him hanging up there,"" he says. ""All I seen was the tree."" Blacks were segregated from whites. They couldn't go to the same schools. They had separate water fountains. Blacks couldn't go in the front doors of businesses. And just about everywhere you went, he says, racism was rampant. ""You go into a place, and they say, 'Nigger, get outta here.' You don't want nobody telling you that. You're a citizen around town.

He registered to vote for the first time in 1959 and cast his first presidential ballot for Kennedy. He says he's voted in every presidential election ever since. ""We felt like we were moving on up when we voted for him,"" he says.

""He was the only hope that we were looking for -- to bring us out,"" Presley says. But when King was killed on April 4, 1968, he says, it ""put us right back where we was.""

""With Obama coming in, it's gonna be another Martin Luther King helping us,"" he says. ""Maybe in the next 40 years, we'll be better off."" He says Americans should never take their voting rights for granted. He was 30 years old before he first voted. ""It means a lot to me, because I can put in for who I want to be president and who not to be president,"" he says. ""So I just feel proud that I can vote.""

The now-abandoned house is dilapidated, many of its windows broken, its doors barely hanging on hinges. ""I've had a good life, despite the hard times. I sure did,"" says Presley, who is retiring after 72 years of working the fields. What's his message to the world? ""The important thing in life is to try to live and do the best you can,"" he says. ""We done had it bad. Let us help give our children a better life, our grandchildren, our great-grandchildren. Let's try to give them a better life than we had.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraq may reactivate long-idle pipelines to get its oil to world markets if tensions over neighboring Iran result in the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a government spokesman said Sunday. The plans include shipping more oil to Turkey's port of Ceyhan and reopening pipelines that could deliver Iraqi crude to ports in Syria, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said in a statement released from his office. Iran is resisting international calls to suspend its uranium enrichment work and demonstrate that its nuclear program remains solely peaceful. The Islamic republic has warned that it will close the Strait of Hormuz if threatened, shutting down access to the Gulf. Oil is the source of more than 90% of Iraq's budget. About 80% of the 2.2 million barrels of oil Iraq exports daily flows through the strait, along with about 20% of world oil production. Iraq's Cabinet approved several recommendations for finding alternatives to shipping oil out of the southern port of Basra through the Persian Gulf, al-Dabbagh said. If the sea route were cut off, Iraq could increase production through its pipeline from Kirkuk to Ceyhan and ship more oil aboard tanker trucks in the short term, he said. Muqtada al-Sadr followers protest government . But in the long run, a government committee recommended reopening a pipeline into Syria and Lebanon that was shut down by the insurgency that followed the U.S. invasion in 2003 and another pipeline to Saudi Arabia's Red Sea port of Yanbu that has been idled since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. But Iraqi infrastructure deteriorated during the sanctions that followed the invasion of Kuwait, and putting those back into service could take years, Iraq's oil ministry has said. The Yanbu pipeline was built during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, when both countries targeted tankers coming in and out of each other's ports. The committee also recommended building a new pipeline that would connect Iraqi oil fields to Jordan's port of Aqaba, also on the Red Sea, al-Dabbah said.","Iraq eyes old pipelines, new projects in case Strait of Hormuz is closed .

"CANNES, France (CNN) -- As award-winning Iranian film-maker Bahman Ghobadi walked down the Cannes red carpet for the premiere of his new feature Thursday, the real star of the show was conspicuously absent. Iranian filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi, director of ""No One Knows About Persian Cats,"" which was co-written by Roxana Saberi. American-Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi, credited as co-writer and executive producer of the faux-documentary ""No One Knows about Persian Cats,"" was still in Iran, having been released from jail only days earlier. The woman Ghobadi describes as his fiancée was freed from prison last Monday after being jailed on espionage charges following a one-day trial that was closed to the public. She had served three and a half months, not all time served, of her eight year sentence and at one point was on hunger strike. ""For four months, she was in prison. For me, four months is like four years,"" Ghobadi told CNN. ""In there, what did they do with her? How did she live in there?"" ""I couldn't understand why the government sent her to prison,"" he continued. ""She is like an angel. She is really so clean. I believe her. For example, if you ask me about my mum and her, I believe her first."" After much to-ing and fro-ing by the Iranian authorities, Ghobadi says he couldn't believe it when he found out Saberi had finally been freed, before the end of her sentence. ""When [I found out] she was free ... I couldn't understand,"" the 40 year-old director told CNN. He said it felt as if the the authorities were playing games with himself and other supporters of Saberi as they gave different timescales for her release -- ""two weeks, four years, eight years."" But just after the pair were reunited Ghobadi -- who won Cannes' first-time film-maker award the Camera d'Or in 2000 with ""A Time For Drunken Horses"" -- had to leave for the French film festival. ""Persian Cats,"" which chronicles the hardships facing young rock musicians as they seek to evade censorship from the authorities, had been selected to play in the Un Certain Regard slot. Although Saberi was unable to be with Ghobadi on the red carpet, Ghobadi says she have kept in close telephone contact since her release, checking on how the film has been received. Ghobadi himself has already suffered at the hands of the Iranian authorities. His 2008 film ""Half Moon"" was banned and says he was left feeling depressed and suicidal after spending three years unsuccessfully trying to get permission from the Iranian authorities for another previous film. He thought about leaving Iran because he felt unable to work and cites Saberi as the inspiration behind ""Persian Cats,"" which was filmed in Tehran. Shot illegally in just 17 days using a small, cheap digital camera -- the state owns all 35mm equipment in Iran, according to film industry trade magazine, Screen International -- the faux-documentary chronicles the hardships facing two young musicians who are trying to put together a band. The story which combines comedy and tragedy to great dramatic effect showcases music and performances from real musicians who are part of the Tehran underground music scene. It is estimated that there are 2,000 illegal bands in Tehran, all practising and performing in a hidden world of hand-built recording studios in basements and rooftops around the city. Ghobadi says that he feels some responsibility for Saberi's time in prison because she stayed in Iran to help him with ""Persian Cats:"" ""She wanted to go back to the U.S. [She] just stay for me and for my film and help for this film and give me the idea for the music."" Ghobadi wrote an open letter in April this year calling for Saberi's release when she was jailed after initially being arrested buying a bottle of wine, describing her as being caught in a ""game of politics."" ""My Iranian girl with Japanese eyes and an American ID, is in jail. Shame on me! Shame on us!"" he wrote of Saberi, who has a Japanese mother, in the letter. Saberi was jailed on January 31 this year, tried on April 13 and sentenced on April 18 to eight years. Her appeal was on May 10 and she was freed the next day. Now, Ghobadi says, he is planning to go to New York this week to be with Saberi, who is currently staying in Vienna with her family. They both plan to write books and then, maybe, do another film together. Ghobadi says he wants to start a family and get married to Saberi as soon as they can. But first they will take a few weeks to process everything that has happened: ""We need the time,"" he says.","Iranian filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi talks about his film's co-writer Roxana Saberi .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As the Cannes Film Festival gets underway, all eyes will once again be on the contenders for the festival's top prize -- the Palme d'Or. As one of the most prestigious awards in world cinema, the Golden Palm has been the launchpad for success for many films over the decades. Quentin Tarantino and Bruce Willis promote the celebrated ""Pulp Fiction"" at the festival in '94. But it's not only Hollywood films that get recognition -- just two Palme d'Or winners have gone on to win Best Picture at the Oscars, and just one American movie is competing in this year's contest. We've picked five of the most groundbreaking and iconic Palme d'Or winners from around the world since the award's inception in 1955. ""Le monde du silence"" (1956) Director: Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Louis Malle Starring: Frédéric Dumas, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, Albert Falco . Cousteau's ""Silent World"" was the first documentary to walk away with the golden palm, having already won the Best Documentary prize at that year's Oscars. This deep-sea exploration was one of the first films to show the beauty of the ocean depths in full color, and was also the first French film to win the Palme d'Or -- until 1955 the award had been known as the Grand Prix. What happened next: Cousteau repeated his Oscar success with ""World Without Sun"" in 1964. It was not until Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" in 2004 that another documentary would repeat ""Le monde du silence""'s success at Cannes. ""La Dolce Vita"" (1960) Director: Federico Fellini Starring: Marcello Mastroianni, Anita Ekberg, Anouk Aimée . Fellini's Roman epic has become one of the most important Italian films ever made, loaded with religious iconography, aristocratic decadence and media comment -- the film even coined the term paparazzi. Tracking a week in the life of a 1950s journalist, ""La Dolce Vita"" was greeted rapturously by critics in both Europe and America. What happened next: An Oscar followed in 1962, and Fellini became a pioneer of arthouse films, following his interest in Jungian psychology. The film's 50th anniversary will be marked at this year's festival with the airing of a previously unseen behind-the-scenes documentary. ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) Director: Francis Ford Coppola Starring: Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall . This one nearly didn't even make the festival -- director Francis Ford Coppola needed persuading to premiere what was then an unfinished three-hour edit of the infamous Vietnam epic. His decision to go ahead was vindicated by rapturous applause from the audience at the end credits. Despite the film's incomplete state, the jury awarded it the Palme d'Or, shared with Volker Schlondorff's ""The Tin Drum."" What happened next: The film is now widely regarded as an all-time classic, with its iconic helicopter attack scene to the strains of ""Ride of the Valkyries"" passing into folklore as one of cinema's most memorable scenes. Coppola won a Golden Globe for Best Director, and the film picked up two Academy Awards for sound and cinematography. ""The Piano"" (1993) Director: Jane Campion Starring: Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Anna Paquin . Writer and director Jane Campion is to date the only woman, and the only New Zealander, to scoop the Palme d'Or, shared that year with Chinese drama ""Farewell My Concubine."" Her stunning period drama featured Holly Hunter as a mute pianist, who also walked off with the Best Actress award at the festival. What happened next: The film enjoyed extraordinary success and critical acclaim -- Hunter went on to take Best Actress awards at almost every major awards ceremony, including the Oscars and Golden Globes, while Michael Nyman's soundtrack became a bestseller. ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) Director: Quentin Tarantino Starring: John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Samuel L Jackson . Quentin Tarantino's eagerly awaited follow-up to ""Reservoir Dogs"" will go down in history as a Cannes classic. The collection of bloody vignettes centering around smalltime LA gangsters stormed the festival -- the whole cast was flown over for the premiere, which received rave reviews across the board, cementing Tarantino's position as one of the world's hippest directors. What happened next: Tarantino picked up the Best Screenplay gong at the Oscars, Baftas and Golden Globes, with the film scoring a host of other awards and nominations. ""Pulp Fiction"" started a life-long love affair with Cannes for Tarantino, who became president of the festival's jury in 2004.","""Le monde du silence"" becomes first ever documentary to win in 1956 .
In 1979, Coppola's unfinished version of ""Apocalypse Now"" takes top prize .
Jane Campion is the only female director to win Palme d'Or, for ""The Piano""

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea will launch additional attacks on South Korea if it continues ""reckless military provocation,"" North Korean state media said Thursday. Meanwhile, South Korea said Thursday that it will strengthen and supplement its rules of engagement in the Yellow Sea, following Tuesday's shelling by North Korea. Marine forces based in five islands near North Korea and the disputed Northern Limit Line also will be reinforced, a government spokesman said. The tense maritime border between the two Koreas has become the major military flash point on the peninsula in recent years. The announcement followed a meeting between President Lee Myung-bak and his economic and security ministers Thursday morning in Seoul. The meeting began with a moment of silence for the two South Korean marines and two civilians who died in Tuesday's attack on Yeonpyeong Island in the Yellow Sea. The shelling also injured 15 South Korean soldiers and three civilians. The attack will lead to a plan being drafted to deal with civilian safety on the five islands in the Yellow Sea, the spokesman said. No details were immediately offered about the plan, but Lee on Wednesday ordered the strengthening of civilian shelters on the islands. The islands include Yeonpyeong and Baengnyeong, off which the South Korean warship Cheonan was sunk in March, killing 46 sailors. Seoul blamed Pyongyang for the torpedo attack, which the North has denied. The Lee administration also will continue to closely monitor capital markets and foreign exchange rates, prepared to take preventative measures as needed, the spokesman said. The shelling sent ripples through South Korea's stock market, which has rebounded. South Korea's economic and security ministries will cooperate closely, and the administration will publicize developments in real time to address major concerns and squelch rumors, the administration said. The attack on Yeonpyeong Island was the first direct artillery attack on South Korea since the Korean War ended in 1953. The United States quickly offered support following Tuesday's shelling, affirming that it would hold joint military drills with South Korea starting Sunday. The USS George Washington sailed toward volatile waters off the Korean peninsula Wednesday for the exercises in a show of force designed to deter a further escalation of hostilities with North Korea. The exercises were billed as defensive in nature and were a more measured response than the retaliation initially urged by South Korea after North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong. ""It is a long-planned exercise,"" said Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""That said, it is meant to send a very strong signal of deterrence and also work with our very close allies in South Korea,"" Mullen said on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" ""We're very focused on restraint --- not letting this thing get out of control. The South Koreans so far have responded that way. Nobody wants this thing to turn into a conflict.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly a year after commandos killed Osama bin Laden at a compound northern Pakistan, U.S. officials ""still have work to do"" in order to defeat al Qaeda, a top counterterrorism official said Sunday. ""We're on a path to al Qaeda's destruction, and the president has committed that we're not going to rest until al Qaeda is destroyed as an organization in the Afghan-Pak area, as well as in other regions of the world,"" John Brennan, U.S. President Barack Obama's chief counterterrorism adviser, told CNN's ""State of the Union."" Killing bin Laden and dismantling the terror group's infrastructure in areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan have been key steps, Brennan said. Officials believe Ayman al-Zawahir, the longtime deputy of bin Laden who took over leadership of al Qaeda after his death, remains in that region, Brennan said. ""We believe he's in that region of the world, as well as other al Qaeda leaders that continue to borough into areas of...the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. That's why we're working very closely with our Pakistani partners,"" he said. ""We're not going to relent until they're brought to justice one way or the other."" The United States also has its sights set on al Qaeda targets in Yemen and Africa, he said. When asked about a new political ad featuring former President Bill Clinton praising Obama for the decision that led to bin Laden's death, Brennan, who also worked with the CIA for 25 years, stressed, ""I don't do politics. I'm not a Democrat. I'm not a Republican."" ""It was a tough decision. As we know, the evidence was not there as far as an iron-clad case. A lot of it was circumstantial,"" the counterterrorism adviser said. ""I just know that President Obama, when the time came for him to make a momentous decision like that, he took the action that did bring bin Laden to justice."" Speaking to reporters Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said there was no ""silver bullet"" that would destroy al Qaeda. ""The way this works is that the more successful we are in taking down those that represent their spiritual and ideological leadership, the greater our ability to weaken their threat to this country,"" he said. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security last week warned of the possibility of terrorist attacks leading up to and after the anniversary of the May 2, 2011, killing of bin Laden. There is no specific, credible terror threat, the agencies said. The warning, released by the FBI and DHS, says individuals have posted messages on ""violent extremist Web forums"" vowing attacks on the United States around the anniversary, but adds that ""such threats are almost certainly aspirational."" On Sunday, Brennan said the United States has ""reduced significantly"" al Qaeda's ""ability to carry out attacks against the homeland."" ""Their ability has been degraded significantly, and our defenses have improved significantly also in the past decade, so their ability to carry out an attack here in the United States now, compared to 10 years ago, is significantly diminished,"" he said.","The United States will not rest until al Qaeda is destroyed, John Brennan says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The wife of an Iranian pro-reformist activist detained as he tried to leave the country last week says she is ""deeply concerned"" for his safety. Fatemah Shams and Mohammadreza Jalaeipour are students together at the University of Oxford. Fatemeh Shams told CNN she hadn't heard from her husband Mohammadreza Jalaeipour since she watched him being escorted away after he was prevented from boarding a flight to Dubai on June 17. Both are students at the University of Oxford and had been returning to the UK from Iran after attending a family wedding, just as demonstrations escalated following presidential elections earlier this month which have plunged Iran into political chaos. Shams said she and her 27-year-old husband -- both activists for the pro-reformist Third Wave campaign -- planned to leave Iran on June 17. At first, everything appeared fine with Jalaeipour having his passport stamped as he passed through immigration. But he was then approached by a plain clothes official who told him to turn off his cellphone before ordering Jalaeipour to follow him. ""We didn't get a chance to talk to each other -- I was watching what was happening and that was the last time I saw him,"" said Shams, 26, who flew to the UK via Doha in Qatar.  Watch Shams speak about her husband's detention » . Shams said she hadn't heard directly from her husband since his arrest but believed he was being held in prison. ""It's a very difficult mental situation for me to understand what is going on and I am deeply concerned about his health and safety,"" she told CNN. Both Jalaeipour and Shams were members of the organizing committee of the Third Wave campaign, a reformist youth movement formed last year to back former president Mohammad Khatami's candidacy in this year's election. Following Khatami's withdrawal from contention, the Third Wave threw its support behind Mir Hossein Moussavi, who has disputed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election, claiming that voting was rigged. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal Jalaeipour said he had advised Moussavi on using social-networking Web sites, such as Facebook, to reach young voters. ""Third Wave was a totally legal campaign with reformist tendencies that was trying to get young people involved in the elections,"" said Shams. ""We believed we should take part to make our country better and to have a better future. We were encouraging young people to not be indifferent about their country."" Shams said she thinks he may have been detained because of his political activities. ""Most of the activists who have been supporting the reformist candidate, all of them are in prison now. Why should the young people who want to do something for the sake of their country and their people, why are they in prison now?"" Shams said she planned to return to Iran herself if there was no change in her husband's situation in the next week or so. But she but admitted her own safety could not be guaranteed if she went back. Following more than a week of daily demonstrations in Tehran, Iranian security forces have been cracking down on protests and arresting activists including Ebrahim Yazdi, a former deputy prime minister who headed a group supporting increased freedom and democracy. Yazdi, who is 76 and has suffered prostate cancer, was later released. Moussavi and former president Khatami have sent a letter to Iran's courts urging them to release arrested activists and protesters.","Iranian activist detained at airport as he tried to leave country .

"(Financial Times) -- With dark clouds gathering over the Chinese economy, the government has started to talk about the importance of supporting growth and speculation is mounting about what actions it will take. Some analysts predict that it will dust off its 2008 playbook and announce a large-scale stimulus package. But others say this is unlikely because Beijing is both less perturbed by the current slowdown and more wary of the dangers of another spending spree. Here is a look at China's policy options, with an assessment of their likelihood. 1. Stick to the original plan . Concerns about fallout from a shaky domestic property market and Europe's debt woes are hardly new in China. These concerns have been around for nearly a year, during which time officials have been very cautious in loosening monetary policy and increasing fiscal spending. Beijing has cut the portion of deposits that banks must hold in reserve twice since November, injecting more cash into the economy. It also has stepped up efforts to construct 36m units of affordable housing by 2015, a big investment programme. On the currency front, it has let the renminbi fall a touch against the dollar this year to aid struggling exporters. At the same time, the government has started to implement longer-term tax and financial sector reforms that are part of its strategy for shifting the economy away from a reliance on investment towards consumption. Until recently, Beijing was content to continue down this gradualist path. The economy has clearly slowed, but at 8.1 per cent annual growth in the first quarter, it has hardly collapsed. Importantly, unlike 2008 when 20m blue-collar workers lost their jobs virtually overnight, there are few signs of labour market distress. Without a more serious plunge in domestic economic growth or a crisis in Europe, the original plan -- gradual monetary easing, some additional fiscal spending, especially on affordable homes, plus longer-term structural reforms -- still looks compelling. ""For Beijing, the first thing it should do is to seriously deliver what it has scheduled for 2012 instead of rushing to announce any new massive stimulus plans,"" says Lu Ting, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 2. Stimulus-lite . Confidence in the strength of the Chinese economy has wobbled over the past few weeks. April data, from power output to bank lending, were disappointing and indicated that the economic slowdown, far from abating, was worsening. One month does not make a trend, but the government appears to be taking out insurance against the signs of trouble. Premier Wen Jiabao said last week that the government should ""give more priority to maintaining growth"", a comment that was seen as the starting gun for bolder fiscal spending plans. There has been a flurry of headlines in recent days in official media about investment projects, from airport expansions to new steel plants, which have been approved by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), a powerful central planning agency. The government has also unveiled or is set to unveil a number of small measures to encourage consumption, including subsidies for energy efficient appliances and another cash-for-clunkers car initiative. However, in contrast to 2008, the government has played down expectations about the size of the potential stimulus -- and even denied that there is really any stimulus in the works at all. The Guangming Daily, a newspaper published by the Communist party, said this week: ""Even if the NDRC is busier than usual, this does not mean there is a new economic stimulus plan."" In this scenario there would be no official ""stimulus package"", and no significant easing of monetary policy or property market restrictions. Instead the government would rely on economic ""fine-tuning"", such as accelerated investments and consumer subsidies, in order to provide a clear boost to growth. ""All these signs indicate to us that a new round of fiscal stimulus has started, although its scale remains to be seen, and is not likely to be comparable with the 'shock and awe' stimulus in 2008-09,"" says Liu Na with CNC Asset Management. 3. Re-run of 2008 . The 2008-09 stimulus -- about 10 per cent of GDP at Rmb4tn ($630bn) -- left China with a double mess of soaring debt levels and stubbornly high inflation that the government spent much of last year trying to clean up. This experience has made Beijing extremely hesitant to crank up another big stimulus. But such reluctance would easily dissipate if the growth downturn becomes much more severe. China International Capital Corp, a top domestic investment bank, warned last week that the economy could slow to 6.4 per cent this year without policy stimulus, well below the 7-8 per cent level that Beijing believes is necessary to create enough jobs for new entrants into the labour force. So some analysts are beginning to discuss the potential for a replay of the 2008 ""big bang"" spending programme, albeit with some modifications. This time around, investment might be directed towards power production, clean energy, and water infrastructure rather than transport networks, as was the case in 2008. Dong Tao, an economist with Credit Suisse, said the headline figure could be as much as Rmb2tn, half as much as three years ago but much bigger than anything that has been officially mentioned this time around. Beyond fiscal stimulus, the government has other big levers within its grasp. In 2008 it aggressively cut interest rates and also sharply reversed course on its tight property policy. These moves were integral to the Chinese recovery in 2009, but they also fuelled a surge in housing prices. Similar moves would again be powerful -- if potentially dangerous -- medicine for the Chinese economy. Some economists think it's too early for such a strong prescription. ""We do not currently look for interest rate cuts or explicit central government loosening of real estate policy, but these will come in the third quarter if the economy is not responding,"" Standard Chartered economists wrote in a note. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","The government has started to talk about the importance of supporting growth .
Speculation has mounted on what form any new stimulus will take .
Will Beijing stay the course, have 'stimulus-lite', or a re-run 2008 boost?"
"(CNN) -- Bloody clashes between pro- and anti-Syrian regime fighters raged on early Sunday in Tripoli, Lebanon, a day after the deadliest outburst of violence there in recent weeks indicated Syria's turmoil continues spilling across borders. Twelve people were killed and about 50 were wounded in fighting on Saturday, the state-run National News Agency reported. The clashes continued early Sunday morning, killing at least one person, NNA said. But government intervention appears to have calmed the situation. Syrian president condemns Houla massacre, rejects accusations . After meeting with leaders from the different factions involved in the clashes, Interior Minister Marwan Charbel announced that national security forces would enter the area to enforce a cease-fire Sunday morning. Tripoli residents and the NNA news agency said Sunday that Tripoli was quiet after the morning clashes, suggesting fighters apparently adhered to the cease-fire. At one point on Saturday, a continuous stream of rockets hindered national security forces' attempts to secure the area, the news agency said. One rocket exploded over a well-known castle in the city, while another landed some distance away. Prime Minister Najib Mikati went to Tripoli to assess the security situation, state news reported. The sectarian violence in Tripoli -- which is on the Mediterranean coast, about 50 miles from Homs, Syria -- mirrors the tensions in its neighboring nation. Clashes in both nations pit Sunnis, who make up the majority of the Syrian opposition and population, against Alawites and other Shiites, who are dominant in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. Sunnis are the majority in northern Lebanon, where Tripoli is located and where anti-Assad factions are relatively strong. The Syrian president, meanwhile, has more support in southern Lebanon and among members of the powerful Shiite militant and political group Hezbollah, which is considered a terrorist organization by U.S. authorities. The recent fighting is not the first time tensions have simmered over, including in Tripoli. Last month, violence flared after Lebanese authorities arrested Chadi Mawlawi, an Islamist activist who was helping Syrian refugees by providing food and shelter, his cousin said. Lebanon had accused Mawlawi of being an operative in an al Qaeda-inspired group -- something his relatives deny. The activist was eventually released, but not before his arrest sparked fighting that killed seven people and left dozens wounded. Elsewhere in Lebanon, the kidnapping of a group of Shiite Muslim pilgrims in Syria prompted angry protests last month in Beirut, the capital. Also last month, gun battles in Beirut between rival Sunni political parties -- one supporting Syria's al-Assad and one opposing him -- left two dead and 18 wounded. That was the worst outbreak of violence in a city where the powerful Hezbollah militia engaged government troops in street battles in 2008. That bloodshed came hours after Lebanese troops killed two Sunni Muslim clerics -- both opposed to the embattled Syrian regime -- at a checkpoint in northern Lebanon. Syria has long been a major influence in Lebanon, and not just because of the extensive border the two nations share. Lebanon was considered part of ""greater Syria"" until the end of World War I. Syrian troops were deployed in Lebanon between 1976 and 2005, primarily in the north -- ostensibly at first as peacekeepers to help stop Lebanon's long civil war, though they stayed long after the fighting stopped in 1990. The Syrian forces' 2005 withdrawal followed the car-bomb killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut, which some blamed on elements of al-Assad's regime. Since then, Lebanon's most prominent political blocs have been sharply divided -- the ruling pro-Syria alliance led by Prime Minister Mikati on one side and anti-Syrian factions led by Saad Hariri, the son of the assassinated former prime minister, on the other. The unrest in Syria that began 15 months ago with peaceful anti-government protests, followed by a government crackdown, has meant further complications for Lebanon.

"(CNN) -- I am married to my same-sex spouse (and partner of 15 years) under the laws of the District of Columbia. We enjoy the same status as our straight married neighbors. Well, not exactly. Despite being legally married, we are prevented by the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) from filing joint federal tax returns and denied the right to Social Security survivor benefits, among many other federal legal rights available to opposite-sex married couples. We are as equally married as our straight counterparts but lack equal rights when it comes to the benefits of marriage. DOMA has the same rights-limiting effect on same-sex married couples in each of the jurisdictions where same-sex marriage is legal: D.C. and six states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York. Same-sex marriage is set to be legal in Washington state next week and in Maryland in January. Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, sitting in Boston, ruled that DOMA's denial to same-sex couples of federal benefits enjoyed by straight couples in Massachusetts is unconstitutional. The court said that there was ""a lack of any demonstrated connection between DOMA's treatment of same-sex couples and its asserted goal of strengthening the bonds and benefits to society of heterosexual marriage."" ""Moral disapproval"" cannot by itself form the grounds for discriminatory legislation, said the court. Notably, the court did not declare any constitutional right to same-sex marriage, and it did not adopt the argument made by the plaintiffs that DOMA was motivated purely by bias against gay people. Rather, the court looked at the case narrowly as one involving a state where same-sex marriage is legal and a federal law limiting the rights available to a certain category of couples married under state law. After a searching review of the purpose of the law and the legislative history, the court found DOMA constituted a federal intrusion into an area traditionally handled by state law -- the issue of marriage and the rights flowing from it. And the court concluded there obviously was a disparate impact on a minority group, same-sex couples. As the court's opinion explained, ""rather than challenging the right of states to define marriage as they see fit, [the case is about] the right of Congress to undercut the choices made by same-sex couples and by individual states in deciding who can be married to whom."" In other words, the case was about whether Congress has any business limiting the legal effect of same-sex marriages as a matter of federalism once a state determines such marriages are to be permitted. The court said that ""one virtue of federalism is that it permits this diversity of governance based on local choice,"" a principle that ""applies as well to the states that have chosen to legalize same-sex marriage"" as to those that have prohibited it. This is where the court avoided ruling on whether same-sex marriage is constitutionally required under equal protection in states banning it, or whether other states need to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. Focusing on the federalism issue, the court found that Congress had not established a legitimate reason for interfering with the state of Massachusetts' regulation of marriage. And it concluded there was no justifiable relationship between the ""defense"" of straight marriage and denying the benefits of marriage available to people of the same sex legally married under state law. So while this case ends up being a victory for the rights of same-sex married couples in Massachusetts (although the ruling immediately was put on hold pending Supreme Court review), its legal reasoning was decidedly conservative, based on a state's rights. The author of the opinion, Judge Michael Boudin, also is known as a conservative. He is a former official in President Ronald Reagan's Justice Department and was appointed to the bench by President George H.W. Bush. Another judge on the three-judge panel deciding the case was appointed by Reagan. In writing the opinion for the court, Boudin said: ""Invalidating a federal statute is an unwelcome responsibility for federal judges,"" a reflection of his and his fellow judges' judicial conservatism. Indeed, far from a case of judicial activism, this recent gay marriage case is one built on a foundation even the Federalist Society would admire and written by a judge whose background they would approve. Thus, the oft-heard claim from social conservatives that same-sex marriage and the legal rulings upholding it are the products of left-wing activist judges is belied by the most recent judicial ruling on the subject, from a majority comprised of conservative judges and with reasoning conservatives frequently invoke to support state rights and to resist the impact of federal laws. Epilogue: Also in Boston this month, the Profile in Courage Award was given by the John F. Kennedy Library to three former justices of the Iowa Supreme Court who were part of the unanimous court establishing same-sex marriage in Iowa as a constitutional right under state law, and who were removed from office after a $1 million campaign against them by conservatives. The Boston judges behind this week's ruling enjoy life tenure under Article III of the Constitution and will not be subjected to such vilification.

"(CNN) -- The ""Linsanity"" surrounding the New York Knicks' surprise phenom at point guard may be motivated by something bigger than sports. Yes, Jeremy Lin is a terrific athlete, whose almost accidental discovery by the Knicks and little-engine-that-could perseverance make for great radio commentary and pop cultural mythology. But there's something deeper at play here: Lin is iconic of a new kind of hero for the 21st century. And he is not alone. Take Lin's story by itself: A Harvard graduate and only occasional Ivy League basketball star, Lin struggles to get recognized in the NBA. He is picked up by the Golden State Warriors only to be released. Then, plagued by player injuries and in need of an extra backup point guard, the Knicks pick up Lin as a temp backup, only to dump him back in the D-league when they think they don't need him. After a string of losses, they bring him back on board more for the hell of it than anything else, and Lin lights a fire under the team, leading it to a run of dramatic victories. Still, Lin is not a superstar in the modern NBA slam-dunk sense. He can drive to the basket and make clutch plays, but the key to Lin's success is his ability to make the rest of his team work -- well, like a team. The economics major is a cool intellectual, who looks at his colleagues as part of a system. His talent is being able to keep them and the ball moving, and to find the open man -- whoever it might be, even himself. This style of play evokes earlier eras of the sport, where teamwork mattered more than individual performance. Yet it also evokes the spirit of our current era -- one in which networks and connections are coming to matter more than individual skill or personal gain. Another view: Jeremy Lin's race is a factor . Consider another Harvard alum in the headlines these days, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. He came up with his social networking platform in his dorm room, with little more ambition than to create a new way for his college friends to connect to one another. And with a combination of perseverance and bit of luck, he ended up in the right place at the right time. Unlike the charismatic CEOs of the industrial age, Zuckerberg is a rather unassuming, quick-to-gaffe computer programmer whose entire premise -- his entire business -- is based on his ability to keep other people networking. At his best, he is a mere facilitator. Likewise, Harvard Law alum Barack Obama came out of nowhere. A state senator gets picked to keynote a Democratic convention, and then somehow flips his huge success at that into a winning presidential campaign. His rise to viability, remember, depended on the strength of his Internet fundraising, and his ability to organize new networks of people around his candidacy through tools like Meetup and Facebook. And again, it's a cool, plainspoken facilitator at the helm: so cool and deliberative that he infuriates even some of his allies, but a strategist whose deeper instincts about playing the political game are only now coming to light. These are not the kind of people we traditionally think of as heroes in sports, technology, and politics. Compare Jeremy Lin, Mark Zuckerberg, and Barack Obama to, say, Michael Jordan, Steve Jobs, and Bill Clinton. Jordan, Jobs, and Clinton were stars in their own right. Their campaigns and their victories were about themselves. It was Jordan who made the dunks, Jobs who showed us the iPhone, and Clinton who made his presidency about himself. Lin, Zuckerberg, and Obama, on the other hand, are rather underwhelming as tribal leaders. They are leaders of the Net generation, who owe their power to the networks they can catalyze. That's why the extent to which these three succeed will be based on their ability to keep the story from being about themselves. Jeremy Lin's biggest problem right now is his superstardom, and the fact that fan focus and adulation could make it harder for him to keep his senior, star teammates from getting jealous and uncooperative. Or worse, they could convince Lin that he really is all that people wish for him to be. Likewise, Zuckerberg's greatest liability is the possibility that the people actually energizing Facebook -- those of us who use it to connect -- begin to suspect that his company and shareholders matter more than us. Once it feels like we're creating more value for him than he is for us, we're out. And finally, Obama's success -- and chances for a second term -- may depend on his ability both to keep the ball moving, and keep his adversaries from casting that dependence on teamwork as some form of European socialism. Remember, Obama did not tell us that he was the one we were waiting for, but rather that we are the ones we have been waiting for. This is 21st century leadership, writ large. Whether we, the president, the Internet or even our sports industry are up the challenge is the real question posed by the rise of a kid named Lin. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- All five remaining inmates held in the Mississippi pardons controversy have now been released from prison. Mississippi's Supreme Court last week upheld the controversial pardons of more than 200 convicts that former Gov. Haley Barbour granted on his way out of office, rejecting a challenge by the state's attorney general. In a 77-page, 6-3 ruling Thursday afternoon, the court found the pardons ""may not be set aside or voided by the judicial branch."" Attorney General Jim Hood argued that no proper notice had been posted in newspapers, but the court found the final decision rested ""solely with the governor."" ""We are mindful that the victims and their families are entitled to be interested in the subject matter of this case, and they are undoubtedly -- and understandably -- concerned with its outcome,"" Justice Jess Dickinson wrote for the majority. But in the cases before them, it was up to the governor to "" decide whether the Constitution's publication requirement was met."" In a statement after the court ruling, Barbour said it ""reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state,"" but acknowledged that his decision has been difficult for many of the inmates' victims. But in a dissenting opinion, Justice Michael Randolph called the decision ""a stunning victory for some lawless convicted felons, and an immeasurable loss for the law-abiding citizens of our state."" Hood argued that the state Constitution required that for a pardon to be valid, notices be filed, each day, for 30 days in newspapers where their crimes were committed. But during a February Supreme Court hearing, Barbour's lawyers argued that previous state court rulings had found the 30-day notice rule was ""an unconstitutional encroachment"" on the governor's power. Thursday's ruling is the final word on the case, but Hood said he would seek to get the notice requirement restored to the state charter. ""We do respect the decision of the Court, but feel deeply for how it must weigh on the victims and their families. It is these victims and family members who have lost today and the criminals who have won,"" he said in a statement, echoing Randolph's dissent. Among the 214 inmates Barbour pardoned before he left office in January were four convicted murderers who had worked as ""trusties"" at the governor's mansion. Critics argued that the governor failed to consider the families of their victims before freeing them. All four and an armed robber also pardoned by Barbour had remained free while the issue worked its way through the courts, and were freed under Thursday's decision. Five other inmates who had remained behind bars awaiting a ruling have been released. Barbour has defended his pardons and said the former inmates had been rehabilitated. CNN's Martin Savidge and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","Attorney General says no proper notice was posted in newspapers before pardons .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi vowed Tuesday that ""we will not surrender,"" even as NATO airstrikes bombarded his compound in Tripoli. ""I am now speaking as planes and bombs fall around me,"" Gadhafi said in a live audio broadcast on state television. ""But my soul is in God's hand. We will not think about death or life. We will think about the call of duty."" At least three explosions rocked Tripoli late Tuesday night; it was not immediately clear what they hit. Earlier in the day, NATO targeted a military base and Gadhafi's compound, state television reported. A spokesman for the Libyan government said that at least 31 people were killed, including a number of civilians, and dozens more were wounded after 60 missiles struck the capital city. The compound was under ""intensive continuous bombardment,"" according to state TV, which reported buildings and infrastructure were destroyed. ""We will not surrender, we will not give up,"" Gadhafi said. ""We have one option -- our country. We will remain in it 'til the end. Dead, alive, victorious, it doesn't matter."" The blasts Tuesday, and others Monday that Libyan officials said hit state television buildings, elicited heated responses from the government spokesman. ""We believe NATO understands that its military campaign is failing miserably,"" said spokesman Musa Ibrahim. ""No one has the right to shape Libya's future except for Libyans."" Ibrahim said Tuesday's morning blasts hit the popular guard compound and revolution compound, which are military barracks near Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound. The spokesman said the attack on the television network killed two people and wounded 16. NATO disputed the account. ""We did not target or hit the Libyan broadcast facilities. What we did target was the military intelligence headquarters in downtown Tripoli,"" the alliance said. ""The story coming from Libyan officials that we targeted and hit the state broadcaster's building is bogus."" The back and forth between Libyan officials and NATO continues a public relations war between the two sides. Libyan officials have continually charged that NATO airstrikes have damaged civilian facilities and killed hundreds of civilians. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said recently that his forces have made ""significant progress"" in its U.N. Security Council mandate to protect Libyan civilians. This week, the Libyan government said it had evidence that alliance airstrikes were harming civilians. Officials took journalists to Tajura, a city east of Tripoli, to show them a small crater that held what appeared to be the remains of a rocket. The reporters were also taken to nearby homes that the government said had been damaged by airstrikes. NATO said it had been active in the area hitting military sites but could not say whether the attacks had caused the damage in the residential area. Reporters were also taken to a nearby hospital to see Nasib, a comatose baby who was a victim of the airstrikes, the government said. A woman, who the government said was Nasib's mother, cried over the child's listless body. Journalists were not allowed to talk to the woman or to the doctors. But one doctor quietly slipped a note to one of the journalists that said the girl was injured in a car accident, not a bomb attack. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, speaking Tuesday to British lawmakers, said the European Union has added six additional ports controlled by pro-Gadhafi forces to its sanctions list in an effort to starve Gadhafi's troops of military supplies. He said the United Kingdom intends to push for additional sanctions against Gadhafi's regime. ""Any political settlement in Libya requires an end to violence and Gadhafi's departure,"" Hague said. CNN's Raja Razek, Dan Rivers and Jonathan Wald contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 31 killed in Libya, including civilians, Libyan government spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Magic Johnson is a part of some exclusive clubs: NCAA and NBA champions. Basketball hall of famers. Olympic gold medalists. Now he's joined an even more exclusive group: players who have become owners of professional sports teams. Last week, the Los Angeles Dodgers announced that a group including Johnson, film producer Peter Guber, baseball executive Stan Kasten and Guggenheim Partners CEO Mark Walter had purchased the team. The staggering price tag: $2.15 billion. Johnson told ESPN's ""Baseball Tonight"" that the new ownership was determined to turn around the ballclub, which has suffered from uneven play, an attendance decline and the Bryan Stow fan-beating scandal in recent years as well as controversy over previous owner Frank McCourt's financial situation. ""We're going to work hard to bring them a winning team and a great fan experience,"" Johnson told the ESPN program. The 2012 baseball season officially opens Wednesday, though two teams played games last week in Japan. The owner's box has traditionally been occupied by the likes of oil tycoons, real estate barons, old-money industrialists and high-tech millionaires. Even in these times of athletes making eight-figure salaries, it's rare for professional players to move from the playing field to the executive suite, observes Richard Davies, a sports historian and professor at the University of Nevada, Reno. Among those who have made the jump: Michael Jordan (part owner of the Charlotte Bobcats), Mario Lemieux (who has a major piece of the NHL Pittsburgh Penguins) and Nolan Ryan (principal owner of baseball's Texas Rangers). There's also historical precedent. Connie Mack, a onetime journeyman catcher, owned baseball's Philadelphia Athletics for more than 50 years; he was also the team's manager and primary executive. George Halas, who played a handful of games for baseball's New York Yankees, took a job with the A.E. Staley starch company of Decatur, Illinois, after his hardball career ended in 1919; a year later he took control of the company-sponsored football team, which became the NFL's Chicago Bears. His family still owns the team today. No guarantee of success . Johnson may find out that big-league experience counts for little in his new profession. Mack had some good runs as A's owner -- particularly in the beginning -- but his teams suffered greatly after post-championship fire sales in 1915 and the early 1930s. In the last 20 years of his ownership, the team finished last 10 times. In those days, there were no multimillion-dollar television revenue streams to provide a rebuilding nest egg; the team almost went bankrupt in the early '50s. But it's not like all the 21st-century perks that teams get these days -- TV money, luxury suites, sponsorships -- have helped some players turn their athletic expertise into ownership triumph. The legendary hockey player Wayne Gretzky became a part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes in 2001. Even after Gretzky took over as head coach, the team struggled. It declared bankruptcy in 2009, and Gretzky stepped down as coach and owner that fall. Jordan bought the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats in 2010. On Sunday, with the team in the midst of a horrific season, Jordan put out a statement that he was ""100% committed to building the Bobcats into a contender"" and has ""no plans to sell the team."" Johnson's already a proven businessman, having built Magic Johnson Enterprises into a $500 million-plus operation with movie theaters and Starbucks franchises, according to Forbes. He said he's committed to being the public face of the team and making the Dodgers the talk of Southern California again. ""I will have my office at Dodger Stadium. ... I'll be doing the community, getting out, selling the Dodger brand,"" he told ""Baseball Tonight."" Mike Veeck, who's a partner in seven minor league baseball teams, said he thinks Johnson can provide exactly the magic the storied Dodgers need. ""They couldn't pick a better front guy,"" Veeck said. ""I think this is a tremendous opportunity for both the fans and for him. I think baseball (fans) are clamoring for a face -- for somebody they feel who is on their side or one of them."" Can Johnson just use his magic? Veeck knows something about bringing fans to the ballpark, using a ""fun is good"" mantra for such promotions as groundskeepers dragging the field in drag, massage-giving nuns and ""VHS Demolition Night."" He's the son of the late, legendary major league owner Bill Veeck, who gave Chicago's old Comiskey Park its exploding scoreboard, hired 3-foot-7-inch Eddie Gaedel for an at-bat and won pennants with the 1948 Cleveland Indians and 1959 Chicago White Sox. The '48 Indians set an attendance record that was surpassed just twice in the next 30 years -- both times by the Dodgers. Mike Veeck urges Johnson to listen to the fans by hosting town hall meetings and making frequent appearances. ""Now we have a chance for a legitimate hero on several planes to say, 'Let's get in this together,' "" he said. ""The most important thing is to involve them."" And once the Dodgers have re-established a customer-friendly reputation, then Johnson can tap into the benefits of Hollywood, Veeck suggested. ""We're celebrity-driven. At first blush I'd name every night of the season after some (star) and almost dare them not to come!"" he laughed. There are never any guarantees in sports, of course. The Dodgers may have been overpriced, hurting future bottom lines. The ownership group dynamics may change. (When he bought the New York Yankees, George Steinbrenner said he'd be a hands-off owner; years later, one of his minority partners, John McMullen, offered the classic observation that ""there is nothing quite so limited as being a limited partner of George Steinbrenner's."") More directly, the crosstown Angels had a huge off-season, signing marquee player Albert Pujols, and have blanketed Southern California with billboards. On the other hand, the Dodgers are coming off a third-place finish and aren't expected to make the playoffs this season. But, said Veeck, don't count Johnson out. ""His name is synonymous with fun and laughter,"" he added. ""I'd love to have that gig, to promote fun and laughter with someone named Magic.""","Magic Johnson becomes one of the rare team athletes to become a team owner .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran revoked the press cards of Reuters staff in the country after the news agency ran a mistaken headline saying Iran was training female Ninja assassins, Iran's official news agency reported Tuesday. ""All activities of the Reuters office in Tehran have been temporarily suspended,"" said Mohammad Javad Aghajari, the Culture Ministry foreign media department director general, IRNA said. The controversy stems from a Reuters video showing women clad head to toe in black, running up walls and flipping backwards and diving and rolling over swords held at waist heights. The Culture Ministry official accused Reuters of calling the martial arts students terrorists, when in fact they are ""university students and housewives"" who ""engaged in this sport because of their love for the sport."" Reuters acknowledged the video report in February ""contained an error"" and that the headline was changed after a complaint. The story's headline, ""Thousands of female Ninjas train as Iran's assassins,"" was corrected to read ""Three thousand women Ninjas train in Iran,"" Reuters said in a statement. Eleven Reuters staff members in Tehran were told to hand in their press cards over the incident, Reuters said. """"We acknowledge this error occurred and regard it as a very serious matter,"" editor-in-chief Stephen J. Adler said, saying the company ""conducted an internal review and have taken appropriate steps to prevent a recurrence."" He said Reuters was in talks to restore its journalists' accreditation. IRNA said authorities would review the case. Iran's own government-run Press TV ran a similar video story earlier in the year showing even more frenetic martial arts moves, including women leaping onto each other's shoulders and flipping them over.

"(CNN) -- Leon Panetta visited a former U.S. Navy base in Cam Rahn Bay, Vietnam, on Sunday, marking the first trip to the base by an American defense secretary since the war ended. The Cam Ranh Bay naval base was an important deep water port and logistics hub for the U.S., and is considered a ""jewel"" of deep-water ports. Standing on the USNS Richard E. Byrd, a ship anchored at the base, Panetta thanked assembled civilian and military personnel for ""your service, your sacrifice."" ""The Vietnam generation is my generation,"" Panetta said, noting there was ""a tremendous amount of blood spilled on both sides"" during the war. He called on those present to ""heal the wounds of the past,"" saying it makes the sacrifices of those who died worthwhile and will help build a better future. Panetta, who headed to Hanoi after the base stop, is on a tour of Asia that includes Singapore and India. His trip aims to boost military ties in the region. ""We still face a lot of threats ... still face a lot of challenges in today's world, and a lot of it is in this part of the world,"" Panetta said. In Singapore, he said, he outlined a new defense strategy. As part of a ""rebalancing"" with Asia, the United States will enhance its military cooperation with China and boost its allies' capabilities in the region, Panetta said Saturday. The defense secretary detailed the new strategy to a gathering of Asia's military leaders, saying the majority of U.S. warships would move to the region. ""By 2020, the Navy will reposture its forces from today's roughly 50-50 split from the Pacific and Atlantic to a 60-40 split in those oceans,"" Panetta said. ""We will also invest -- invest in cyber, invest in space, invest in unmanned systems, invest in special forces operations,"" he said. ""We will invest in the newest technologies. And we will invest in new technology to mobilize quickly, if necessary,"" Panetta said. Along with enhanced military cooperation, Panetta emphasized diplomacy that includes ""open and free commerce, and open access by all to their shared domains of sea and air"" -- a current point of friction in the South China Sea between China and regional nations. The increased regional involvement by the United States has raised concerns about tensions with China. ""I reject that view entirely,"" Panetta said, calling the U.S. shift ""fully compatible with the development and growth of China. Indeed, increased U.S. involvement in this region will benefit China."" Panetta said the United States will work to improve communication with China to build trust between the two nations.","The Cam Ranh Bay military base was an important logistics hub for the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Tina Gangidine is so passionate about President Barack Obama, even her pet lovebird campaigned for him. ""I left the campaign sign by her cage, and whenever she would get out she would always hop right over to it and sit for long stretches staring at it,"" said the retired middle school teacher from Ohio. ""I guess she was a political bird. Well, so is the rest of her family, so she came by it honestly."" Gangidine campaigns in her swing state for the president pretty much nonstop, but she paused long enough to post a photo of the starry-eyed creature -- known as The Bird, H.R.H. (Her Royal Highness) -- on the Pet Lovers for Obama Facebook page. It got more ""likes"" and thoughtful comments than almost anything else she's ever posted, and that includes the Twitter feed and Facebook pages she runs for her neighborhood's Obama campaign. Suddenly, she realized there was a lesson. ""When we are phone banking, we have to work really hard to get someone to pick up and talk with us,"" Gangidine said. ""People love their pets so they pay attention to this kind of thing, and it's a really positive message for them to see from us."" Obama outspends Romney online . Presidential pets have certainly played a role in politicking before. President Franklin D. Roosevelt often appeared in photos with Fala, his Scottish terrier. President George W. Bush sent holiday videos of his dog Barney every Christmas. President Bill Clinton's cat, Socks, even had its own book. But this virtual campaign by Obama for America to encourage people to ""like"" its Facebook page, post photos of their pets and recruit friends is taking the presidential love of pets to a whole new level. It seems to be working. More than 16,500 people have ""liked"" the page so far. Hundreds of others have posted photos of their furry friends. A dog named Teddy Roosevelt abandoned his namesake's political party to wear a navy Obama shirt. Baby, a gray cat, looks smart in a ""Cats for Obama"" collar. There's even an unnamed chicken sporting an Obama bandana. Such pet-specific merchandise is available on an accompanying Obama campaign site. There's an ""I Meow for Michelle"" cat collar, a ""2012 Barack's best friend"" dog collar with a matching leash, a Bo ""I bark for Barack"" car magnet, and many others. All purchases count as campaign donations. Chicagoan Lisa Capretto posted a photo of her pit-bull mix Rocco sporting an Obama T-shirt and sitting patiently with human-sized Obama sunglasses perched on his wet nose. ""My brother works with the campaign, and he brought over a bunch of gear,"" Capretto said. ""Rocco is clearly such a tolerant and sweet dog."" While Capretto and her husband have donated money to Obama's re-election effort, the photo she submitted is the only real campaigning she plans to do. ""We are still enthusiastic about the president, but I'll leave the grass-roots campaigning to my brother,"" she said. ""I do like this particular effort, though, and I thought the least I could do was lend my support by taking this ridiculous picture."" There is no parallel pet-themed campaign for Republican candidate Mitt Romney. There is a Vets for Romney Facebook page, but that's for the military -- not the animal -- kind of vet. A Dogs Against Romney Facebook page has racked up more than 55,000 ""likes,"" but it was created as a tongue-in-cheek response to the story of how Romney strapped a crate containing his Irish setter, Seamus, to the roof of his car during a road trip to Canada. The page is not sanctioned by any campaign. ""We've seen this for months. The Obama campaign would rather talk about anything under the sun, including dogs, if it means they can distract from the most important issue on the minds of every American -- jobs and the economy,"" Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said. ""Every minute team Obama talks about something other than jobs and the economy, they are attempting to hide Obama's record from voters."" The Obama campaign won't comment on its digital strategy. But its attempt to engage with the pet set may now be aimed at many more voters. As a part of its general online ad blitz, Obama for America created an ad in which the candidate himself never appears. Instead, under the title ""Join Pet Lovers for Obama,"" is a lone photo of the president's dog, Bo. None of the popular online animal sites like Petfinders.com, Dogster.com, or icanhascheezburger.com say they've received the ad, but the ad has run on several general news sites, which reach a broader audience. ""They are clearly wide-casting with this ad and are looking for places where they can persuade swing voters and independents and women with this,"" said Drew Westen, an Emory University psychology professor and author of ""The Political Brain,"" a book about the role of emotion in deciding elections. ""It's a nice, neutral message. Who doesn't like a dog?"" Kate Kaye, senior editor for ClickZ, a trade publication that covers the digital advertising industry, thinks the dog ads are a strategic attempt to cultivate a certain type of voter. ""Maybe Obama's staff thinks people who are sentimental about their animals are more likely to be interested in more liberal issues,"" Kaye said. ""As the campaign builds up its data on who views these ads, they can go back later and specifically target that reader with whatever their next appropriate issue ad is."" Denise Small, a volunteer with the Humane Society of Western Montana, submitted a photo of her 16-year-old Persian cat Mysty wearing an Obama bandana to Pet Lovers for Obama. She thinks the pet campaign lends the president credibility. ""It helps him seem so genuine,"" she said. ""For me, as someone who is passionate about animals, how genuine someone is as a human is most important to me in a politician. I think he reflects my values, and it is clear he is a passionate advocate for human rights and for low-income people. I don't see that from the other side.""

"London (CNN) -- A storm of outrage provoked by photos of Pippa Middleton showing her in a car with a man wielding what appears to be a gun in France should act as a wake-up call, royal watchers have warned Prince William's sister-in-law. ""This story is very damaging for her,"" veteran London-based public relations expert Max Clifford told CNN. ""There has been nothing but a honeymoon for Pippa since last year's royal wedding so this is dreadful,"" Clifford said. ""It comes particularly at a time when guns in Paris are such a sensitive issue. The reality is she could have been shot by police."" Middleton has been a target for tabloid newspapers and paparazzi since her sister married Prince William last April. Shortly after the wedding, personal pictures of the 28-year-old began to leak out to the press, including a photo showing her in a bikini while on vacation in 2006 with her sister and Prince William. A photo of Middleton sunbathing topless on that trip was also made public. Later, undated photos from a private party showing her dancing in her bra were also leaked. The latest incident happened as paparazzi were taking pictures of Middleton who was being driven to a Paris train station in an Audi convertible. The car's driver wielded a gun, apparently pointing it in the air and then at a photographer, who was following them and captured the shot, according to The Sun. It is unclear if the gun was real or fake. Lawyers told CNN that Middleton was unlikely to face charges unless it could be proved she encouraged the driver to point the gun on public streets, but the driver could face charges of threatening with a firearm if French authorities wanted to do so. Middleton is the sister of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, who married Prince William last year. William is second in line to the British throne behind his father, Prince Charles. Buckingham Palace said it would not comment on the photo because Middleton is not a member of the royal family. The photo is causing a stir, after a spate of gun violence in France recently, including a series of attacks last month that killed seven people, including three children. The incident took place while security was heightened ahead of France's presidential election. ""Pippa must understand she's in the middle of a media spotlight and she can't just turn the attention on and off,"" Clifford added. ""I assume she has PR advice but either she's getting incredibly bad advice or she's not listening."" The story has been splashed across newspapers around the world, and on Tuesday royal experts warned that Middleton must avoid further incidents for risk of damaging the royal family. ""Pippa is surprised at how high-profile she now is,"" one royal newspaper correspondent, who has met Middleton on several occasions, told CNN. ""Part of her enjoys the attention: she's always mixed with high-society characters and she loves partying but she's not off the rails by any means. ""This prank in a Paris street will come as a real wake-up call for Pippa,"" the correspondent, who declined to be named, told CNN. ""She must now realize that it just takes one person waving a gun around to seriously dent her public image. She'll be gutted by how badly this has reflected on the royals."" But the correspondent said he believed Paris authorities would have no choice but to investigate the incident, while Middleton would be forced to issue a public apology. The photographer who snapped the shot was ""considering his options"" about a formal police complaint, The Sun reported. The Daily Express's royal correspondent Richard Palmer commented that ever since Middleton became last year's most celebrated bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister Kate to Prince William, she has been ""riding the crest of a wave of popularity. Some think she has also been riding for a fall."" Palmer said Middleton was popular at high-society events, but she and her friends needed ""to learn how to behave in front of the cameras in return."" The incident ""will have embarrassed her sister Kate, her brother-in-law Prince William, and also the Queen in her Diamond Jubilee year."" ""She needs to explain herself and apologize.""","Storm of outrage over photos of Pippa Middleton in car with man apparently wielding gun .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Army command sergeant major who authorities accuse of lying about receiving Purple Hearts for bravery during combat and making false claims about fighting in Vietnam and Afghanistan was indicted by a federal grand jury on Wednesday. William John Roy, 57, is charged with seven felony counts of defrauding the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense, prosecutors said. The indictment accuses the Winchester, California, resident of using ""bogus military documentation"" in applications that allowed him to receive $27,000 in disability benefits for himself and $30,000 in educational benefits for his daughter. ""In the documents, Roy falsely claimed that in 1974 he served as a combat medic in Vietnam in a special forces unit and was twice injured in combat. With false records that purported to detail his bravery during combat incidents in Vietnam, Roy further claimed he was awarded two Purple Hearts, as well as a Bronze Star for valor,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California said. Prosecutors said that an investigation revealed Roy had been in Germany in a noncombat role during the time when he claimed to be fighting in Vietnam. ""According to court documents, Roy submitted a Purple Heart Certificate purportedly signed by Richard Nixon four months after the president resigned from office,"" prosecutors said. The indictment also accuses Roy of providing false information regarding his service in Afghanistan in March 2005. In 2008, prosecutors said, Roy sent a letter to the Army requesting a Purple Heart for extensive injuries he said he suffered in an attack on a military base in Jalalabad. An investigation revealed that Roy was not involved in any such attack, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Roy could not be reached for comment. Prosecutors said he remains an active duty command sergeant major, the highest rank available to enlisted personnel in the Army. An Army spokesman could not immediately confirm Roy's military status Wednesday night. Roy will receive a summons directing him to appear in a federal court next month for an arraignment, prosecutors said. He is charged with one count of presenting false writings to defraud the United States, three counts of making false statements to the government and three counts of stealing government property. He faces up to 55 years in prison if convicted on all the charges.","William John Roy is charged with defrauding the VA and the Department of Defense .

"(CNN) -- In 1988, the West Coast hip-hop group N.W.A released a provocative song called ""F**k tha Police,"" which stirred controversy and marked it as one of the most high-profile examples of tension between the black community in Los Angeles and authorities. A few years later tensions erupted into rioting and violence in that city following the acquittal of Los Angeles police officers in the videotaped beating of motorist Rodney King. Those two incidents, and whether the former helped spark the latter, is just one of the topics explored in the documentary ""Uprising: Hip Hop and the L.A. Riots,"" which airs at 9 ET Tuesday night on VH1. The project was the brainchild of director Mark Ford and executive producer Brad Abramson, both of whose professional credits include stints at CNN. The pair told CNN earlier this year at the South by Southwest music, film and technology festival that the documentary was an idea they had long thought of bringing to the small screen. ""We had worked together on a documentary about N.W.A. a few years ago,"" Ford said. ""That was always in my mind, the song 'F**K Tha Police' and how powerful it was, and was there a connection between that song and what happened years later?"" Abramson added, ""We have the Roc Doc franchise at VH1, and I always look for film and subjects that transcend music and that impact social and cultural ways of living, and this felt like one of those. It was a huge moment in time for America, and there was a music angle that no one had ever looked into."" Now 20 years after the riots, the rapper Snoop Dogg narrates the documentary, which includes appearances and commentary from other rap stars, including KRS One, Ice T and Nas. In the film, KRS One notes that ""Rodney King was the confirmation of everything we had been rapping about since the early '70s."" ""Boyz N the Hood"" director John Singleton, who is featured in the documentary, told CNN, ""It was almost as if the riot legitimized everything we were trying to do as artists and show the world what was happening in our neighborhoods."" The filmmakers gained access to several people connected to the riots, including Henry Keith Watson, who participated in the beating of white truck driver Reginald Denny following police officers' acquittal in the King case. Watson has long maintained his silence, but Ford and Abramson were able to get him to open up on film in a moment that shows him shrugging when asked if he regrets his part in the assault on Denny. ""(Watson) pretty much tells it like it is,"" Ford said. ""That was a very interesting thing to explore, that 20 years later even people who participated in the looting, Snoop Dogg being one of them, aren't incredibly repentant or apologetic about it,"" he added. ""They look at it as something that happened; it was a moment in time that was a frenzied and mob feeling."" Former talk-show host Arsenio Hall appears in ""Uprising"" and attended a recent screening and panel discussion about the film. As the 20th anniversary of the riots is marked, Hall said the country must never forget. ""Here we are 20 years later, but it's almost like the battle against AIDS,"" Hall said. ""If we stop talking about it, people get careless, and they stop remembering that we're on a mission."" Ford and Abramson said they are aware some may take offense at the title ""Uprising,"" viewing the events as more of a crime than a revolution. But Ford said he hopes viewers come away from the documentary with a different message. ""It shows how powerful music can be, what it can do and what it means to people,"" he said. ""I hope what people really take away from it is for us to pay attention to the suffering going on in our society. It just so happened at that time, hip-hop was about the only place you could hear the messages being told.""

"(CNN) -- There is no better way to ring in the spring season than with a free pass to the carefree days of childhood when no one could chastise you for a well-executed prank -- as long as it brought a smile to both parties. You may choose to privately celebrate April Fools' Day by covering your office toilet seat in saran wrap or telling your mom you're engaged to a death metal drummer. Or you may celebrate publicly, if you live in one of the American cities that host festivities. In San Francisco, revelers can dress up in outlandish outfits and participate in the Saint Stupid's Day parade. New Yorkers can run the ""Backwards Mile"" through Central Park or attend the April Fools' Parade, which has been announced for the last 26 years, but never taken place. But if you want to take your pranking abroad, there are other countries that do tomfoolery even better than America. Here's a destination guide for the ultimate purveyor of mischief. France . Many sources claim April Fools' began in France after King Charles IX decreed that all citizens must begin their calendar on January 1, moving the start of the year back by three months. Therefore, those who celebrated around the beginning of April were deemed foolish. Considering there are earlier mentions of the holiday, this origin story is a little fishy. But the French celebration is even fishier. The day itself is called Poisson d'Avril, as pranksters attempt to attach paper poisson (fish) to unsuspecting fools' backs. Perhaps the most enjoyable tradition of this holiday is all the fish-shaped treats and pastries that fill bakeries and chocolate shops. Scotland . If you're a true gowk hunter, then you should head to Scotland, as their April Fools' celebrations last for two days. Hunt the Gowk Day is celebrated on April 1. ""Gowk"" is Scottish for ""cuckold"" or ""fool,"" and the goal of the day is to hunt them out and make them aware of their foolishness. The traditional prank of this day revolves around making someone go on a fool's errand. And while day one is dedicated to making someone the butt of a joke, day two is all about making a joke out of someone's bum. April 2 is Taily Day, when you're not only allowed, but encouraged, to focus your attention on the posteriors of others. The infamous ""kick me"" sign most likely originated as an early Taily Day joke. Spain . The Spaniards celebrate their version of April Fools' on December 28, so you have plenty of time to plan. El dÃ­a de los Santos Inocentes is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the remembrance of the ""Holy Innocents"" who were killed when King Herod ordered the death of baby boys in Bethlehem after hearing that he was going to lose his throne to the newborn King of the Jews, according to the Gospel of Matthew. Yes, pranks to commemorate the mass slaughter of infants. The fool of each prank is considered an inocente, and after the prank is made, the prankster shouts the phrase to let him know he's been had. If you really want to make the most of the day, celebrate in the town of Ibi, Alicante, which hosts the Els Enfarinats festival that has taken place for two centuries. Participants partake in a mock coup d'etat that culminates with one of the world's largest food fights when everyone takes to the streets with flour and eggs. Mock soldiers run around in the bedlam, collecting ""taxes"" that go to charity. India . India gets the award for most vibrant custom, with their Hindu holiday, Holi. Also known as the Festival of Colors, this celebration takes place on the last full moon day of winter, someday in February or March. The next Holi takes place on March 27, 2013. All across the country, participants take to the streets, playing pranks and throwing colorful, scented powder at each other. In this bacchanalia that gives you an idea of what it would look like if a Skittles factory exploded, the social structure and norms aren't as black-and-white as they are throughout the rest of the year. No one is expected to be polite when they're expecting to be blasted in the face with a handful of rainbow dust. But along with chaos, this tradition induces a national sense of exhilaration truly fitting for the beginning of spring. The holiday is exceptionally more exuberant in the northern India. Some of the best cities to celebrate are Mathura and Vrindavan; Delhi; and Shantiniketan, West Bengal. Ukraine . Although the nation itself doesn't show great enthusiasm for April Fools' Day, the port city of Odessa more than makes up for it with Humorina -- a festival of humor. On April 1, the city erupts with parades, concerts, plays, art, fireworks, costumed locals and pranks galore. Americans might go out of their way to confuse a friend or coworker, but since Humorina was created in 1973, Odessans have proven themselves as some of the most creative and dedicated pranksters in the world.","In France and Scotland, pranksters often attach things to a victim's back .

"(Financial Times) -- Australia's resource-rich economy expanded at twice the pace expected by economists in the first quarter of 2012, lifted by an unexpected increase in household spending and continued heavy investment in mining projects. Gross domestic product advanced 1.3 per cent from the previous quarter, when it rose a revised 0.6 per cent, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This was well above market expectations of a 0.6 per cent rise and, excluding the quarter that followed the 2011 flooding in Queensland, was the fastest acceleration in economic growth in five years. In annual terms, GDP growth in the year to March was 4.3 per cent. The strong reading came a day after the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its benchmark interest rate to 3.5 per cent -- the lowest level in almost three years -- because of ""moderate domestic growth"" and a ""weaker and more uncertain international environment"". Wednesday's report showed capital expenditure in the mining sector up 14 per cent in the first quarter of the year, and the main driver of a 20 per cent increase in private infrastructure investment. But it was a 1.6 per cent rise in household spending during the quarter that surprised the market. ""Despite their negativity about a lack of wealth growth and cost of living increases, the consumer is spending money,"" said UBS economist Scott Haslem. Treasurer Wayne Swan hailed the figures as ""stunning"" and said they showcased the ""rock-solid economic fundamentals"" that put Australia in a ""league of its own"". ""This is a remarkable outcome and reaffirms Australia's position as one of the strongest economies in the world, with the Australian economy growing faster than every single major advanced economy in the March quarter,"" said Mr Swan. But economists said the data, which preceded the latest bout of global economic worries, might prove to be the growth peak for Australia, and highlighted the unevenness in growth between the mining and non-mining sectors of the economy. Final demand -- a measure of spending in the local economy by the private and public sectors -- in the mining centres of Western Australia and Queensland rose 13.6 per cent and 7.8 per cent year-on-year respectively, compared with 2.1 per cent in New South Wales and 1.9 per cent in Victoria. ""The result is very likely to be the high water mark for growth, with more cautious households, further declines in dwelling activity, and much bleaker offshore conditions, which will be an ongoing drag on export volumes, to compromise growth from here,"" said JPMorgan economist Stephen Walters. ""Despite the upbeat headline outcome, the picture painted today still is one of an economy not quite firing on all cylinders. Output from the miners, for example, bounced 2.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter and other industries turned in decent performances. Manufacturing output, however, dived another 0.8 per cent quarter on quarter (the sixth decline in the last eight quarters)"", noted Mr Walters. However, the Australian dollar rallied following the release of the report, rising 1 per cent to $98.40 cents as forecasts for further rate cuts were revised. ""The market's expectation for a terminal cash rate around 100 basis points below the current level is not compatible with the resilience of the Australian economy,"" said Citigroup economist Paul Brennan. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Australia's resource-rich economy expanded at twice the pace expected by economists .

"(CNN) -- The chairman of the club that hosts America's most prestigious golf tournament skirted the prickly issue of women's membership Wednesday, saying it is a private matter. During his annual media session, Billy Payne, chairman of Augusta National Golf Club, did not comment specifically on Ginni Rometty, the top executive at IBM and, undoubtedly, one of the corporate world's most powerful women. IBM's sponsorship of the Masters tournament guarantees club membership for its officers, but Rometty is a woman, and the club does not allow women to join. ""Well, as has been the case, whenever that question is asked, all issues of membership are now and have historically been subject to the private deliberation of members,"" Payne said. ""That statement remains accurate; it remains my statement."" IBM spokesman Ed Barbini told CNN Wednesday that the company would not comment on the controversy. The question of Rometty's membership has again brought the gender controversy to the forefront. Women's rights activist Martha Burk tried to change the exclusionary policy nine years ago when she showed up at the Augusta entrance to lead a series of protests against men-only membership. Her efforts were in vain. Now, she says, ""the boys"" at Augusta, members and sponsors alike, find themselves in a big bind. ""The 'woman problem' is back,"" she wrote in a column for CNN on Tuesday. Burk says there are only two choices at hand: Augusta can open its doors to women, or IBM can yank its money and force its male executives to resign from the club. ""Those are the only two options that are viable that are going to wash with the public,"" Burk told CNN last week. Augusta's membership -- which includes titans of industry and finance -- has been male-only since the club's opening in 1932. When Burk tried to change things in 2002, Augusta's then-chairman, Hootie Johnson, resisted, saying that gender integration would not come ""at the point of a bayonet."" In 2006, Burk was among a group of Exxon shareholders who accused the company of violating its discrimination policies by supporting the tournament. Nonmembers can play on the course only when hosted by members. Augusta is famously secretive about its membership, and the club declined to comment on the issue, as did IBM spokesman Chris Andrews. ""Augusta is a private club, and their personal membership is an internal matter,"" he said. IBM, however, has played a role in changing policy before. The company pulled television ads from the PGA Championship when it was played at the whites-only Shoal Creek golf club in Alabama. The club admitted its first African-American in 1990 and now claims former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as a member. Augusta also did not welcome its first black member until 1990, when Gannett television division president Ron Townsend joined the club. On the eve of the 2012 Masters opening Thursday, speculation surfaced that Payne, known to be more progressive than his predecessor, will offer Rometty a membership, but only after the tournament ends and the gender debate dies down. ""Sorry, but that dog won't hunt,"" Burk wrote. ""Telling Rometty to be a good girl and wait a little longer with IBM's collusion would be a disaster -- not only for the company's image, but for Rometty's credibility as its leader."" More and more people are asking Augusta to man up and get rid of what they say is a discriminatory policy from the past. Payne did not announce any sweeping changes from the hot seat Wednesday. That means that Rometty will probably not show up this year in a green jacket. The question is: Will she ever? CNN's James O'Toole and Leigh Remizowski contributed to this report.","Augusta National Chairman Billy Payne is asked about the men-only membership policy .

"New York (CNN) -- New York City police on Wednesday evening were searching the New Jersey home of Pedro Hernandez, who is accusing of killing Etan Patz more than three decades ago, NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said. Police executed a search warrant as part of an ongoing investigation into Etan, the boy who disappeared on May 25, 1979, in New York. Meanwhile, Hernandez's wife said her husband's confession to police is coming from a man with mental illness, her lawyer said Wednesday. Rosemary Hernandez ""feels strongly that the confession is unreliable,"" attorney Robert Gottlieb said. Pedro Hernandez is charged with the second degree murder of the 6-year-old boy, who disappeared on his way to a New York school bus stop more than 33 years ago. The suspect, who is being held without bond at New York's Bellevue Hospital, is receiving a medication called olanzapine, according to a source familiar with his medical history. The drug is used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia, according to the National Institutes of Health. He is scheduled to undergo a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he's competent to stand trial, said his lawyer, Harvey Fishbein. Hernandez admitted choking the boy after luring him into the basement of a bodega, a small grocery store, police said. He allegedly told authorities he threw away the boy's body in a garbage bag. Etan's remains have not been found. His lawyer previously told a judge that Hernandez has a history of mental disorders, suffers from hallucinations and is bipolar. ""Mrs. Hernandez has seen her husband's delusions and hallucinations and other mental illnesses for a very long period of time,"" Gottlieb said. Rosemary Hernandez's lawyer would not elaborate on the mental disorders nor would he provide an example of what his client observed. ""She does not believe the confession at all,"" Gottlieb said. Gottlieb said he was asked to represent the wife because of her growing frustration over the case and her desire to make sure prosecutors ""understand the severity and nature of the mental illnesses."" A spokesman for the district attorney's office had no comment Wednesday. Pedro Hernandez's next court appearance is scheduled for June 25.","NEW: New York police obtain search warrant in boy's 1979 disappearance case .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese officials have formally honored a bus driver for saving the lives of 24 people when he managed to stop the bus after being struck by a piece of flying sheet metal that came crashing through his windshield. Wu Bin, the 48-year-old bus driver, collapsed shortly after pulling over. He died on Friday, three days after the accident in Zhejiang province, eastern China. On Tuesday, the Zhejiang provincial government awarded Wu the title of ""Provincial Labor Model"", according to a statement from the government office. Local officials said all citizens should learn from Wu's selfless act. Similarly, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions awarded Wu the ""May 1st Labor Medal,"" one of the highest honors for Chinese workers. But officials aren't the only ones praising Wu for his actions. Between 2,000 and 3,000 people attended his funeral Tuesday morning, a staff member at the Hangzhou Funeral Home told CNN.

A procession held Monday through the streets of Hangzhou in Zhejiang province where Hu worked also drew thousands of mourners, including dozens of transportation workers, according to the state-run Shanghai Daily. Police told the Shanghai Daily that they have narrowed the search to nine vehicles that might be the source of the errant piece of metal and they plan to prosecute whoever is responsible.","Chinese government honors bus driver who pulled over despite being fatally injured .

"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- A jury of five men and seven women, along with four alternates, was chosen Wednesday in the trial of Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach charged with child rape. Half of the 16 jurors and alternates have ties to Penn State, including one retired professor and one current professor, three graduates, two employees and one current student, showing the prominence of the university in the local community. Sandusky, 68, has been under house arrest since being charged with sexually abusing 10 boys for at least 15 years. Prosecutors say he met some of his accusers through Second Mile, a charity he created for underprivileged children. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Sandusky jury lockdown: Risks vs. costs . Letters written by Sandusky to one of his alleged victims, identified only as Victim 4, can be described as love letters, a source familiar with the case said Wednesday. One letter describes love between a man and a boy, the source said. The letters are expected to be entered into evidence during the trial, two sources with knowledge of the case said. However, the letters, as first reported by ABC News, may be given a different interpretation by the defense. They are expected to argue that the letters and notes that Sandusky sent are benign and illustrate his love for the children he has helped over the years through Second Mile, according to a source familiar with the case who asked not to be named. Victim 4's attorney, Ben Andreozzi, said Tuesday that he expects that letters from Sandusky to his client will be introduced at the trial, but he declined to comment on their content. Jerry Sandusky's 'make-believe world' Gifts that Sandusky allegedly gave to Victim 4, who is now 28, may also be introduced as evidence by prosecutors, according to a source close to the case. Those gifts could include golf clubs and football jerseys, a source said. A source close to another alleged victim, Victim 1, said that Victim 1 received birthday cards and notes from Sandusky but that they were not sexually explicit in nature. They included statements such as ""I love you"" but did not contain anything overtly sexual, that source said. Joe Amendola, Sandusky's attorney, asked Judge John Cleland for a continuance Wednesday, saying Andreozzi violated the court's gag order. Cleland denied the request. Before a gag order was imposed in April by the judge, a source close to the case told CNN's Jason Carroll the defense would argue the letters in question were not inappropriate. The source said Sandusky wrote letters of encouragement over the years to dozens of young people. Some were football players, or Second Mile participants, or other young people he tried to encourage to be better students. The source said these letters were not intended to bribe or to encourage anything sexual from the recipients. The source also said Sandusky would give gifts to encourage these boys to stay on track with their grades, attending class or taking part in charity functions. Amendola told CNN's Carroll in November 2011 that his client ""cared about a lot of kids."" ""And there are hundreds of other kids who Jerry took to events and to whom he provided gifts,"" Amendola said. ""What we're saying is, that was Jerry."" Opening statements are expected to begin Monday, Cleland said, and the trial is likely to last about three weeks. The prospective jurors were quizzed Tuesday and Wednesday about their relationships with Penn State, local law enforcement and Second Mile, and whether they had contributed to any of those entities. Several reported knowing Sandusky or his wife, and others said they had volunteered at Second Mile. The seated jury includes five members with children: three women and two men. Some jury members said their jobs require them by law to report suspected sexual abuse cases. They range in age from early 20s to 70s and include a Wal-Mart worker, a high school teacher, a retired school bus driver and a student in his junior year at Penn State who has ties to the football team and knows some witnesses in the case. Prosecutors plan to call more than 50 witnesses during the trial, and the defense plans to call about 100, including Jay and Sue Paterno, coach Joe Paterno's son and widow; former graduate student Mike McQueary; his father, John; and former university President Graham Spanier, among others. Defense attorneys said Wednesday their list will also include seven Sandusky family members. Authorities allege that Sandusky abused some of the boys on the Penn State campus. The case has shaken the university, raised questions about its response to the allegations and drawn criticism from those who claim Penn State put its reputation ahead of protecting potential child victims. Spanier and iconic head football coach Paterno lost their jobs soon after Sandusky's arrest amid criticism that they did not adequately handle the matter when allegations involving Sandusky arose years earlier. Paterno died of complications from lung cancer in January. McQueary, the former graduate student, is considered to be a key witness in the Sandusky case. He has testified that he alerted Paterno in 2002 that he'd seen what appeared to be Sandusky sexually assaulting a boy in a shower in Penn State's athletic facilities, an allegation that authorities didn't learn of until years later. Paterno apparently told Athletic Director Tim Curley, but no one notified police. Curley and Gary Schultz, Penn State's senior vice president for finance and business, are now facing felony charges of perjury and failing to report the allegations to authorities. Prosecutors said later that the McQueary incident took place about a year earlier than was originally alleged, causing defense attorneys for Curley and Schultz to argue that one of the charges should now be dropped. Both of them have pleaded not guilty, and their attorneys have said that prosecutors ""charged this case before (they) knew the facts."" The prosecution is preparing witnesses for their testimony next week, several sources close to the case said Tuesday. Victim 4 is expected to testify first, with Victim 1, who started the investigation by coming forward in 2008 and alleging years of abuse, to follow, the sources said. McQueary and his father were told to be in town and ready to testify next Wednesday or Thursday, one of the sources said. Cleland told members of the jury pool that jurors in the case will not be sequestered, saying he will trust them not to read newspapers or follow the case online. As jury selection in the case began Tuesday, Penn State released a statement, saying, ""The acts that Jerry Sandusky is accused of committing are horrible and if proven true, deserve punishment."" The university said it would not comment on the specifics of the legal case but said it hopes that the trial ""provides answers we are all seeking"" and that ""the legal process will start to bring closure to the alleged victims and families whose lives have been irrevocably impacted and that they can begin the healing process."" Several of Sandusky's alleged victims, including Victim 4, asked a judge to protect their identities at trial. However, Cleland ruled Monday that the alleged victims' identities may not be concealed during the trial, although they will be protected through the jury selection process. CNN generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault. In interviews after his arrest, Sandusky acknowledged showering and ""horsing around"" with boys but denied being sexually attracted to them. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Laura Dolan, Ross Levitt and Dana Garrett, CNN contributor Sara Ganim and InSession's Lena Jakobsson contributed to this report.","Half of chosen jurors and alternates have Penn State connections .

"(CNN) -- The Netherlands finally found some pre-Euro 2012 form on Saturday with an ominous 6-0 thrashing of Northern Ireland that will boost the 2010 World Cup finalists' hopes of a second continental title. Having lost to German club Bayern Munich and 96th-ranked Bulgaria before beating Slovakia 2-0 on Wednesday, the 1988 European champions needed a good result before heading to the tournament in Poland and Ukraine. Coach Bert van Marwijk gave a pointer to the opening Group B game against Denmark on June 9 by leaving free-scoring striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar on the bench, as Robin van Persie spearheaded the attack with Arjen Robben and Ibrahim Afellay on the wings. The Arsenal forward continued the form that made him the English Premier League's top scorer as he netted twice, while Barcelona's Afellay also bagged a double. Wes Sneijder scored the second goal with a superb free-kick in the 15th minute as the Inter Milan playmaker shook off an ankle worry that saw him fail to finish the Slovakia game, while defender Ron Vlaar sealed it with a header on 78. Denmark also wrapped up preparations with a win, bouncing back from the 3-1 defeat by Brazil to beat Australia 2-0. Daniel Agger netted a first-half penalty and fellow central defender Andreas Bjelland doubled the lead in the second half. However Portugal -- who face Germany in the other Group B opener -- crashed to a disappointing 3-1 home defeat against Turkey as Cristiano Ronaldo missed a penalty. Having been held goalless by Poland and Macedonia, the Euro 2004 finalists needed a good result but went 2-0 down as Toulouse striker Umut Bulut scored in each half. Midfielder Nani reduced the deficit in the 57th minute, but Real Madrid top scorer Ronaldo's penalty was saved by Volkan Demirel before defender Pepe diverted an attempted clearance by teammate Ricardo Costa into his own net near the end of the match. Co-hosts Poland, who kick off the tournament with a Group A match against Greece on Friday, won 4-0 against European minnows Andorra. Ludovic Obraniak and striker Robert Lewandowski scored before Jakub Blaszczykowski's penalty made it 3-0 at halftime, while Marcin Wasilewski added another spot-kick after the break in front of a 30,000 crowd in Warsaw. New England boss Roy Hodgson enjoyed his second successive 1-0 victory, but faces more injury problems following the home match against Belgium. Hodgson has already lost midfielders Gareth Barry and Frank Lampard for Euro 2012, and now Gary Cahill needs a scan on a suspected broken jaw and fellow central defender John Terry will have a tight hamstring checked. Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck scored the only goal of the game in the first half, but was taken off as a precaution in the second period. Croatia conceded a late equalizer in a 1-1 draw with Norway, as striker Eduardo's second-half header was canceled out by Tarik Elyounoussi. Slaven Bilic's team, who beat Estonia 3-1 on May 25, will face the Republic of Ireland in their Group C opener next weekend. In World Cup qualifiers, Uruguay and Venezuela moved to the top of the South American group after a 1-1 draw in Montevideo. However, both nations could be overtaken by Argentina and Chile, who were to play fifth-placed Ecuador and bottom team Bolivia respectively later on Saturday. In African qualifiers, Cameroon's Indomitable Lions made a winning start to their bid to appear at the World Cup for the seventh time, beating Democratic Republic of Congo 1-0. With captain Samuel Eto'o suspended, the winner came via a second-half penalty from Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. In Group B, Tunisia beat Equatorial Guinea 3-1 while Sierra Leone won 2-1 at home Cape Verde Islands. In Group C, Ivory Coast opened with a 2-0 win over 10-man Tanzania thanks to goals from European Champions League winners Salomon Kalou and Didier Drogba, while Morocco fought back to earn a 1-1 draw away to Gambia. In Group D, African Cup of Nations champions Zambia lost 2-0 away to Sudan -- and next weekend face Ghana, who thrashed Lesotho 7-0. Senegal beat Liberia 3-1 in Group J, while on Friday Egypt won 2-0 against Mozambique in Group G.","Netherlands crush Northern Ireland 6-0 in final Euro 2012 warmup match .

"(CNN) -- The distraught family of a university student allegedly killed and dismembered by a Canadian porn actor have journeyed from their village in China to Montreal, where the grisly act took place. The family of Jun Lin, 33, met with investigators Wednesday, Montreal police told CNN affiliate CTV. Yan Shi, the head of the Chinese student association at Concordia University, where Lin was studying, told CTV that Lin's mother was extremely emotional and could not get through her words without constant tears. ""We come to take you home now,"" she said. In the grisliest Montreal crime in years, police believe porn actor Luka Rocco Magnotta killed and dismembered Lin and posted a 10-minute video of it online. Montreal police Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere said the video shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts and also included evidence of cannibalism. The sick fascination with a death video . Police believe Magnotta sent Lin's body parts by mail to Ottawa and Vancouver. Magnotta then fled Montreal for Europe. Police arrested Magnotta in Berlin on Monday after he was spotted in an Internet cafe. He will be extradited to Canada to face first-degree murder charges. Suspect and victim knew each other, though has not defined the nature of their relationship. Lin's family hailed from a village in China and did not have much money, Lafreniere said. Montrealers have stepped up to help them in their days of absolute grief. ""I am proud of that,"" Lafreniere said. Magnotta described himself as 'a people person' At a corner convenience store where Lin worked, a makeshift memorial went up with notes of condolences. Kankan Huang, Lin's boss at the store, said he felt terrible for the family. ""If they need anything, I can do my best,"" he told CTV. All along, as gruesome details of this case have surfaced, Lafreniere has taken care with reporters to be mindful of the family's feelings and to show respect. Parts of Lin's body are still missing, including his head. ""We have been working extremely hard to find all the body parts with respect to the family,"" Lafreniere said. Lin's left hand and foot were mailed to the headquarters of Canada's Conservative and Liberal parties in Ottawa. His right hand and foot showed up this week at two Vancouver schools. Lafreniere told Vancouver radio station CKNW that Magnotta had spent time in Vancounver. ""Was it just passing by, or been there for a long time. We don't know,"" he said. ""But we know he used to be in Vancouver, at least."" Montreal police are investigating a website that hosted Magnotta's chilling 10-minute video of Lin's murder. The site could face criminal charges for publishing obscene material. Magnotta's name made headlines last week but he had already left disturbing trail in cyberspace. Lafreniere said investigators plan to look into accusations by online animal rights activists that Magnotta killed kittens by suffocation or drowning and videotaped himself doing it. There are also rumored links between the suspect and notorious killer Karla Homolka, arrested in 1993 for the rapes and murders of three Ontario girls, including her own sister. As part of a plea bargain, Homolka served 12 years in prison and was released a few years ago. So far, Lafreniere said investigators have no evidence linking Magnotta to other crimes. But he remains the sole suspect in Lin's killing. ""Right now, we got no reason to believe there could be someone else involved in this horrible crime,"" Lafreniere said. CNN's Moni Basu and Paula Newton contributed to this report.","'We come to take you home now,' Jun Lin's mother says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Football fans in the UK are ushering in a potential new age of football ownership after plotting a takeover bid for English Premier League Liverpool FC. Fan property? Liverpool supporters are plotting a takeover of the club. The ShareLiverpoolFC organization is a collective of fans looking to raise enough money to make a serious takeover bid at the club. They are seeking 100,000 people to invest $7,000 to raise $700m that will allow them to take over from the current owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks. The group plan to have their own fan parliament, fan board and an employed board in charge of the club. But can absolute fan ownership be considered a serious contender to the existing business model? In the case of Liverpool, the group appears to be making progress -- after releasing an 'open letter' to the owners inviting them to discuss the purchase of Liverpool FC. Do you own shares in a football club? Would you want to own and run your team? Gillett and Hicks completed a $490 million refinancing deal with UK and American banks in January -- saddling the club with annual interest repayments of $42 million, part of the reason why fans are so keen to take over the running of their beloved club. Across Europe the practice of fans owning is fairly common, particularly in Spain where Barcelona is a supporter-owned club run by around 150,000 of its fans. Real Madrid -- the most successful team in Spanish football -- and Atletico Barcelona also belong to members called ""socios."" In the UK, the move of football fans toward club ownership has been propelled by the threat of overseas owners taking charge and making decisions not favored by the local fans. Football governance expert and management lecturer at the Birkbeck University of London, Dr Geoff Walters, said the reason fans often get involved is to make sure clubs are being ""run as effectively and sustainably as possible."" Walters said some Premier League sides, including Arsenal, had a small percentage of shares owned by the club, while smaller clubs Brentford, Stockport County and Chesterfield were among the teams where fans had a larger stake. Many of those fans were assisted by Supporters Direct, an organization that helps supporters' trusts from numerous clubs buy shares and have representation at their clubs. However, at the greatest extreme of fan ownership is English conference side Ebbsfleet United. In 2008, the club was taken over by more than 30,000 individuals through web site Myfootballclub.co.uk. Each shareholder paid £35 ($48) to have their say in the club for a year, and could vote on decisions like team selections and ticket prices. According to David Davis, chief executive of Ebbsfleet United, the model has had a few teething problems -- but he feels it could be sustainable. The club had recently lost many members at the one-year renewal, with numerous people citing the recession as the reason for their departure, he said. ""We originally had 30,000 people,"" he told CNN. ""We expected to lose a considerable number of these after a year and now we are down to a core of about 10,000. ""The very positive thing is that we have this solid core of people who are in it for the longer term. If we can get through this season I think we have conquered it. It's a sustainable model,"" he said. Davis said some members got involved with voluntary work at the club and he was surprised at the interests many shareholders had. ""I think it's still evolving. It's very clear people are in it for different reasons. Some are in it to pick the team, while others are happy just to try to help out at the club and talk of their frustration with the 'fat cat' clubs. ""There has been a surprising interest in the business side of it rather than the football side of things,"" David said. Walters disagrees with Davis' optimism for Ebbsfleet, saying fan ownership is possible, but its best derived from within the club's own fan-base. Walters felt the ShareLiverpoolFC model and the concept promoted by Supporters Direct, were more sustainable as they were geared towards fans of the club. It would be more difficult to retain interest under the Ebbsfleet model where anyone could pay the money and become an owner, he said. ""Because they allow anybody to buy a share. If you're not a supporter of that club, do you really have an attachment to that club?""","Liverpool fans are hoping to pool enough money to take over the club .
Many clubs have small or large stakes of shares owned by supporters .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned a NATO airstrike this week that a provincial official says killed women and children, in a statement that came just as U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta arrived Thursday in Kabul for talks. A provincial official has said civilians were among the dead in the airstrike, while the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said initial reports revealed only two injuries. ISAF is aware of the claims of civilian casualties and is looking into what took place, a spokesman for the coalition said. The NATO airstrike Wednesday in eastern Afghanistan's Logar province, along the volatile Pakistan border, is likely to strain already tense relations with the United States. In the statement, Karzai said he was cutting short a trip to China, where he has been attending a summit. ""NATO operations that inflict human and material losses to civilians can in no way be justifiable, acceptable and tolerable,"" he said. Panetta did not address the controversy over the airstrike in his public remarks while in Kabul. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan on Thursday condemned ""in the strongest terms"" the deaths of civilians in Logar and in militant attacks in Kandahar, Faryab and Paktika a day earlier. Together, the attacks killed 40 civilians, including 10 children, and injured at least 67 others, the U.N. body said, in what was the single deadliest day for civilian deaths in 2012. While militant attacks have caused by far the greatest number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan, its statement said, ""UNAMA has also repeatedly expressed concern that aerial operations have resulted in more civilian deaths and injuries than any other tactic used by pro-government forces since the present armed conflict began."" Sahib Khan, a member of Afghan parliament from Logar province, told CNN he believed four insurgents also were killed in the NATO airstrike in the Baraki Barak district of Logar province. He said the bodies of 18 civilians, including women and children, had been brought to the provincial capital, Pule Alam, but that the bodies of the four insurgents had been taken elsewhere. An investigation team has gone to the area to determine how many militants were in the building hit in the airstrike, said Khan. He said insurgents had fired on a U.S. military convoy from the house. Panetta: U.S. running out of patience with Pakistan on militant havens . The allegations of civilian casualties came ahead of discussions between Panetta and U.S. Army Gen. John Allen, commander of ISAF troops, and Afghan Defense Minister Gen. Abdul Rahim Wardak. The training of Afghan security forces was likely to be high on the list of discussion topics. With American troops due to withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of 2014 under a timetable announced by President Barack Obama, the U.S. military is beefing up its training of Afghan forces. At that time, security duties will be fully turned over to the Afghan government, although some U.S. forces will remain in Afghanistan beyond 2014 as military advisers. The latest allegations of civilian casualties also come at a critical time for the United States. While U.S. military and political officials have said publicly that Afghanistan will be ready to take over security of its country by the time NATO troops depart, critics have said there are questions about whether Afghan forces can stand on their own. Violence has increased in recent weeks, coinciding with the start of the Taliban's summer fighting season. On what was his fourth visit to Afghanistan, Panetta praised the efforts of U.S. forces, saying that thanks to them, a ""turning point"" had been reached after 10 years of war. He acknowledged that there had been an ""uptick in violence,"" but said that was because ISAF forces had taken the fight to the Taliban. ""We've been able to put this country in the right direction. The reality is we have weakened the Taliban,"" the defense secretary told an audience of U.S. troops. But while Afghan forces are gaining in strength and capability, he said, international forces still have work to do. ""This is still not going to be an easy fight. We still have a lot of challenges to confront. We have a resilient enemy that will use any tactic they can to come at us."" Panetta said that ISAF forces would continue to support Afghanistan beyond the agreed troop drawdown, with an ""enduring presence"" past 2014, and that the goal was to ensure a safer future for the United States as well as for the Afghan people. Asked what message U.S. troops should give to Afghan commanders concerned about what would follow the transition to Afghan control, Panetta said: ""We are not going anyplace. We are committed to an Afghanistan ... that can secure and govern itself. ""We have lost a lot of people in battle, and we continue to lose people. One thing we have to make damn sure of is that those lives were not lost in vain."" Panetta's brief trip to Kabul did not include a meeting with Karzai, who was en route back to Afghanistan at the time the U.S. defense secretary was wrapping up his trip. The last meeting between the two, in March, came on the heels of allegations that a U.S. soldier left his base in southern Kandahar province and went on a shooting spree in two villages that left 17 people dead. At the time, Karzai called the shootings a cruel act against the people of Afghanistan, and told Panetta that Afghans have lost trust in international forces. The shooting spree followed revelations that U.S. troops inadvertently burned copies of the Quran and other Islamic religious materials, which sparked massive, violent protests. Military officials said the materials had been seized from Afghan prisoners because they contained extremist messages.

"(CNN) -- The U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria recently determined that the fighting in Syria is not an ""armed conflict"" (PDF) -- the legal term for war -- under international law because the opposition forces are not sufficiently organized. Yet surely the protesters, dissident fighters and terrified citizens caught up in the violence in Syria believe they are at war. States and other international legal experts are following the same overly technical approach and, as a result, not applying the law designed for just this situation: the law of war. The international community is left unable to use every available tool in its efforts to halt the violence and protect civilians from extraordinary suffering. Failing to call Syria's upheaval an armed conflict -- the legal term for war -- has real and immediate consequences. Contrary to what events in Syria suggest, war is not waged in a legal vacuum. International law regulates permissible conduct during war, even civil war. The law of war exists specifically to restrain brutality in war, protect innocent civilians from direct attack and minimize suffering. It prohibits deliberate attacks on civilians and using them as human shields, requires humane treatment of the wounded or detained personnel, obligates parties to respect and protect medical aid providers, mandates efforts to facilitate delivery of humanitarian relief, and imposes criminal responsibility on those who disregard these obligations. These basic and essential protections apply during any armed conflict. The only rule that President Bashar al-Assad and his forces follow, however, is the rule of unrestrained brute force. Indiscriminate shelling of towns; civilians forcibly used as human shields; and attacks on the wounded, ambulances and humanitarian workers are a daily staple in the mismatched struggle between al-Assad's heavily armed and morally corrupt forces and the regime's opponents: protesters, dissident army units and other fighters. Massive suffering from heavy-handed government responses to internal threats is nothing new; indeed, the images from Syria are unfortunately all too common. Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Sudan and now Syria are the latest in history's long line of notoriously brutal struggles between competing factions within a state. Historically, states did not recognize the law of war's application during internal conflict, arguing that internal matters were solely the concern of the state. The need to maximize protection of civilians in the face of the unprecedented brutality of internal conflicts -- especially the Spanish Civil War -- was the primary motivation for including fundamental law of war protections for such conflicts in the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Demanding that the Syrian government respect international human rights obligations is certainly appropriate. These obligations protect the same fundamental rights as the law of war. But armed conflict involves a level of force and violence that triggers the law of war's more specialized international legal regime, one better suited to address war's full range of challenges. Notably, however, there are no demands that the parties abide by the law of war. The United Nations Commission and other experts may fear that acknowledging an armed conflict in Syria will give both sides free rein to use military force. Such concern is naÃ¯ve in the present circumstances. Al-Assad is already using maximum firepower. The primary concern must be whether we can use every available tool to regulate that use of force to protect innocent victims. Reality thus tragically demonstrates that the essential dividing line in Syria is not between peacetime and wartime but between the law of war and no law at all. Syria's crisis surpassed that demarcation line long ago, even if the opposition is not extensively organized. Levels of violence obviously exceeding what is normal during peacetime and, especially, a government unleashing its full military might to repress a dissident threat call for the application of the law of war. The international community's refusal to recognize an armed conflict in Syria can only be characterized as not seeing the forest for the trees. Widespread recognition that the situation has risen to the level of armed conflict is no talisman: It will not result in immediate intervention, nor is it likely the regime will immediately change its tactics. What it will do is arm those seeking an end to indiscriminate brutality with a clearly defined legal basis to demand restraint from the parties to the hostilities. Perhaps more important, it will place Syrian leaders on immediate notice that their actions will be judged against a standard of wartime conduct, and that they are accountable for the widespread suffering they have caused. It is time to call a spade a spade and demand compliance with this law. By doing so, an international community increasingly disgusted by events in Syria can send a clear message that the law's basic protections for persons in the conflict zone must be upheld and that every leader responsible for violating this law will be held to account. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laurie Blank and Geoffrey Corn.","Writers: What is happening in Syria is a war, but international legal experts refuse to call it that .

"(CNN) -- For years, bloggers and other netizens have repeated: ""A link is not an endorsement."" Now it appears that we have to add, ""a 'like, 'follow' or 'retweet' is not an endorsement, either."" That's the only way to respond to the wave of breathless news stories and fancy web tools claiming to divine all kinds of correlations between Twitter buzz or Facebook followers and how the GOP presidential candidates will fare in the primaries. The worst of the new wave is The Washington Post's new MentionMachine tool ""that monitors Twitter and media across the Web for political candidate mentions, revealing trends and spikes that show where the conversation is and why."" It claims that ""growth in the numbers of legitimate followers or a high recurrence of retweets are both indicative of growing grass-roots support."" Groan. Actually, growth in followers or high numbers of retweets are just an indication of notoriety or celebrity. Saying simple, stupid things that lots of people want to tell their peers about can get you tons of followers and retweets. But it doesn't mean anything definitive about grass-roots support. Otherwise, right now we'd be talking about Herman Cain's amazing victory in Iowa. (Need I remind you of when he was getting headlines topping the Facebook ""buzz"" charts) These are empty information calories, to borrow a phrase from Clay Johnson's timely new book, The Information Diet. Eat them at your own risk, for they can make you really dumb. This isn't to say that campaigns should ignore social media, or that efforts by voters to influence the election by organizing online are pointless. But just because you can count something and chart it doesn't mean you've proven anything. Take, for example, Newt Gingrich's 1.4 million Twitter followers. On Huffington Post, Alan Rosenblatt demolishes the notion that this means he's popular among Republicans. Half of those accounts aren't in the United States. And half of all Twitter accounts aren't even active. Newt's numbers are a sign of online longevity and notoriety, not much more. Rick Santorum's late surge in Iowa should also put the mania for tracking online buzz into perspective. All of last year, he trailed the pack online. Meanwhile, he worked Iowa the old-fashioned way and did his best to tap into a social network that is more locally rooted than anything Facebook or Twitter has to offer. That is, the evangelical church. As the other candidates with a claim on that community started to fall away, Santorum's fortunes started to rise. And then in late December he got really lucky, sidestepping the negative attention and negative advertising that battered some of the other top-tier candidates while peaking at just the right time. Now the issue isn't how many new followers Santorum may get online, but how well he engages them and converts these low-level indications of interest into money, volunteers and votes. So far, the tidings aren't great. As my colleagues Sarah Lai Stirland and Nick Judd pointed out yesterday, Santorum's website wasn't quite up to the task of handling the burst of traffic he earned Tuesday night, potentially costing him millions in overnight donations. Nor does his site offer supporters a way to self-organize, the way My.BarackObama.com or MyMitt.com invites supporters to start their own profile pages or set up their own house parties and fundraisers. (And I haven't even mentioned the Santorum campaign's failure to successfully address his ""Google problem,"" which Search Engine Land's Danny Sullivan dissects at great length today.) Online politics is complicated and requires a level of technological literacy that most people, reporters included, simply lack. So as you encounter breathless headlines about the role of social media in the 2012 election, or how the race is going to be won or lost on Facebook or Twitter or whatever, just remember this: a link, or a follow, or a retweet, is about as meaningful as a glance or a nod. It's an indication of fairly low-level interest, nothing more. Organizing all those glances or nods into something powerful -- that's what really matters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Micah Sifry.","Micah Sifry: Growth in followers and retweets are signs of low-level interest .

"(CNN) -- One senator who has survived the vice presidential vetting process described it this way: Like having a colonoscopy without anesthesia. The probing, highly personal examination that a presidential candidate uses to pick a running mate is uniquely American. Yet it is entirely shielded from public view: Those who submit themselves to it must bow to a secret, often uncomfortable ""deep dive"" for information by a small, exclusive tribunal of lawyers and accountants trying to wrest any skeletons out of a candidate's closet. ""It's every aspect of your life,"" former Al Gore 2000 presidential campaign manager Donna Brazile said. As former Bob Dole 1996 campaign manager Scott Reed put it, the examination includes digging into ""sex, drugs and rock and roll."" Since presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's vice president meetings and deliberations are secret, a typical campaign practice, it's anyone's guess who is actually being vetted. But if Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and other potential candidates have been asked and have agreed to a vetting, they are virtually assured a process even more intense than the vetting they faced while running for office. Who might run with Romney? It's ""the most intimate examination known to politics,"" Sen. John McCain's 2008 vetting chief A.B. Culvahouse recently wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece. ""No other candidate, not even the presidential nominee himself, is subjected to the same scrutiny."" Romney is intimately familiar with the process. In 2008 he submitted to a vetting to be McCain's running mate. Simple process becomes a deep dive . The process usually begins simply: drawing from various sources, such as a candidate's preferred picks and names from others, a vetting team will draw up a list of potential vice president picks. In his book ""An Amazing Adventure,"" written with his wife, Hadassah Lieberman, Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman said that in 2000, Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Al Gore's initial list of potential running mates contained 30 or 40 names. Similarly, Culvahouse wrote that McCain's team prepared initial vetting reports on a list of more than two dozen people, none of whom knew they were being vetted. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker shoots down VP talk . Acting essentially as private investigators, vetters mine the Internet and public records, like newspaper articles and disclosure forms, for information on the potential candidates. Those chosen for further inspection will be asked to agree to a confidential vetting. If they agree, the candidates fill out a multiple-page questionnaire. How a candidate answers could generate a list of more probing questions. ""They're looking for things that could be embarrassing,"" Reed said. In 2008, McCain's potential vice presidents -- including then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin -- faced 70 questions. Among them: Have you ever paid for sex? Have you ever been fairly or unfairly accused of sexual harassment? Have you ever hired an illegal immigrant? Culvahouse talked about the questioning in his recent Journal opinion piece. Explaining that he asked potential picks ""questions I would not dream of posing in any other context,"" Culvahouse added, ""Yet, as in all campaigns, if we had allowed good manners to intervene, anything we missed surely would have been dredged up by someone else."" ""We asked about infidelity, sexual harassment, discrimination, plagiarism, alcohol or drug addiction, delinquent taxes, credit history and use of government positions or resources for personal benefit. Nothing was off-limits."" Culvahouse wrote that he discussed other matters with Palin: including daughter Bristol's pregnancy, ""which the governor raised in a private discussion,"" ethical allegations against the governor and whether she would authorize a strike against Osama bin Laden if it meant civilian casualties. All vetting information is ultimately relayed back to the candidate. Noting her lack of experience on foreign policy and defense matters, Culvahouse said he advised McCain that ""Gov. Palin would not be ready to be vice president on January 20, 2009, but that I believed she had the presence and wherewithal to grow into the position."" McCain chief judged Palin 'high-risk, high reward' ""I summed up her selection as 'high risk, high reward.' I stand by that advice,"" Culvahouse wrote. Palin recalled her side of the vetting process in her book ""Going Rogue."" Of Culvahouse's vetting, Palin wrote: ""By the time his team of attorneys finished peppering me with questions, I decided that if a person had ever done a single dark and secret thing in their lives, Culvahouse's people would not only find out about it but get eyewitnesses, photos and blood samples."" ""These guys knew stuff about me that I had long forgotten: They knew how I had voted on issues during my days on the city council. They reviewed copies of my tax returns. They had transcripts of sermons that visiting pastors had preached at a church I had not attended regularly since I was a teenager. And they were the ones who told [McCain campaign strategist Steve] Schmidt that Bristol was pregnant."" ""I was impressed. I also thought, 'Good. They know exactly what they're getting.' "" By all accounts, candidates being vetted must divulge nearly every facet of their lives: surrendering tax returns, medical records, financial statements, court records, employment records, education records and enduring background checks and a thorough check of public statements and voting records. Surviving the questionnaire and what Reed called the ""deep dive"" of information, potential vice presidents gain a reward: making it on the so-called ""short list,"" where vetters ramp up their efforts to pull skeletons out of a candidate's closet. ""If you get near the end, you usually get down to what I call, 'Sex, drugs and rock and roll,'"" Reed said. ""Where it's usually a one-on-one conversation between the chief vetter and the potential candidate."" Reed said this could include ""allegations of sexual relations, drug use, alcohol use, other medical conditions that may have been hinted at in medical records. You really have to drill down."" Lieberman recalled in his book the ""exhaustive and demanding"" vetting experience, led by former Clinton Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Gore's behalf. ""When Warren Christopher called to tell me I had made it to the short list and that they would soon have to start vetting me, he warned, 'Are you still willing to go forward with it, because it's not easy, and it can be a painful process, and there's no way I can reduce the pain?'"" ""So I said, 'Chris [which is how he is known], you mean this is kind of like having a colonoscopy without anesthesia?'"" ""Chris laughed and agreed,"" Lieberman wrote. Eagleton in 1968 taught future candidates a lesson . Helping to guide Lieberman through the process was attorney Jonathan Sallet. Speaking to CNN, Sallet used a historical reference to stress the need for a careful vetting. He discussed presidential candidate Sen. George McGovern's selection of Missouri Sen. Thomas Eagleton as his running mate in 1972. Eagleton withdrew just 18 days later after his treatment for mental illness and electroshock therapy became public. ""I think that was a lesson that people in both parties learned: that anything that could be considered important by voters needed to be considered important by vetters,"" Sallet said. In past times, vice president picks were chosen at the political conventions. Only in recent years have running mates been chosen in a months-long, secret process that culminates in an announcement just before the convention. Not all skeletons spell doom for consideration. As Gore's campaign manager, Brazile was not involved in vetting Lieberman. But in her decades-long career in politics, she recalled a multitude of times she has vetted candidates for public office. ""In some cases"" scandal can knock a candidate out of consideration, Brazile said. ""Remember, this is the first presidential decision that a presumptive nominee, like a Mitt Romney, will make, like an Al Gore will make,"" Brazile said. ""So you want to get it right. You will be judged by this individual throughout the campaign."" Brazile added: ""For a campaign, [damning information] can become an explosive part of a candidate's biography, especially when they're introducing themselves for the first time to the national media and to the public."" Reed echoed the sentiment. If scandal does emerge, Reed said, ""It depends on how severe it is."" ""You keep that confidential. But you go back to the candidate and you discuss it,"" Reed added. ""Dole had a very explicit rule to me: Don't do anything to embarrass anybody,"" Reed said. ""Which means, if you find out information, you don't leak it out to see how it gets vetted out in the court of public opinion."" In the final stretch, a potential running mate typically meets with the presidential candidate in a secret meeting. Lieberman explained his private meeting with Gore. ""My turn came early one morning in late July, when I was smuggled into the U.S. Naval Observatory, the vice president's official residence, in the backseat of a van with darkened windows,"" Lieberman wrote. ""Over breakfast, Gore said that this was awkward because we were friends, but he had to interview me."" ""I told him not to worry. I knew how important this decision was, and he should feel comfortable asking whatever he wanted to know."" ""He then proceeded to ask, in essence, 'Why should I pick you?' ""","Those considered as a potential vice president face a thorough examination .
The intense vetting is necessary because a VP pick represents a candidate's first big decision .
John McCain's vetting chief said he asked questions he ""would not dream of"" any other time .
Candidates being vetted face scrutiny of almost every facet of their life ."
"(CNN) -- The Boy Scouts of America, indicating its ban on openly gay members will remain in effect, said it will consider a resolution asking that local units be allowed to determine their own standards. An unidentified volunteer leader in the Northeast introduced the resolution. Members of a committee have until May 2013 to make a report or recommendation to the group's National Executive Board, said Boy Scouts spokesman Deron Smith. The debate over the Boy Scouts' membership policy is not new. ""Resolutions of this nature are not unique,"" Smith said on Thursday. But the issue is back in the headlines because of the resolution, a separate online petition and the formation of a group that wants Boy Scouts to end its ""outdated"" policy. Jennifer Tyrrell's case has been championed on Change.org, where the petition has garnered more than 290,000 signatures in support of the Boy Scouts reversing its position on gay leaders. The lesbian Tiger Cub den leader was dismissed by her local troop earlier this year. ""This isn't about my sexuality; this isn't about anybody's sexuality,"" Tyrrell said in April. ""It's about teaching children to be better adults, and we aren't doing that by teaching them to hate or discriminate."" Smith said Tyrrell understood the policy when she signed up. Tyrrell told CNN's Kyra Phillips on Thursday that her partnership was never an issue within the troop. ""Nobody cares. We were just scouts."" Among those supporting Tyrrell is Eagle Scout Zach Wahls, now 20, who last month delivered Change.org signatures to the Boy Scouts of America at an Orlando, Florida, meeting. Author of ""My Two Moms: Lessons of Love, Strength, and What Makes a Family,"" Wahls is co-founder of Scouts for Equality, which said it will lead a ""respectful, honest"" dialogue on the matter. ""When I was earning my Citizenship in the Community merit badge, I learned the importance of standing up for what you believe to be right,"" he wrote on the group's website. ""By embodying the values of the Scout Oath and Law, we believe we can restore the social relevancy of one of this country's great cultural institutions: the Boy Scouts of America,"" Scouts for Equality says. Tyrrell, whose 7-year-old son is no longer in scouting, told CNN's Soledad O'Brien that she is optimistic about the resolution. ""I think that America gets it, that we are ready for this change,"" Tyrrell said. ""And I think that the Boy Scouts .... along with President Obama, they're evolving and, hopefully, eventually they'll get there."" A 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision found that a New Jersey law requiring the national organization to readmit an openly gay scoutmaster infringed on the organization's First Amendment right of expressive association. ""Forcing a group to accept certain members may impair the ability of the group to express those views, and only those views, that it intends to express,"" then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote at the time. He added that the decision was not meant to approve or condemn the Scouts' membership policy. The Boy Scouts on Thursday clarified its membership policy, saying the introduction of the resolution does not indicate the group is ""reviewing a policy."" That would occur only if the executive board formally considers the issue, at the earliest next year. It said the Change.org petition is ""completely unrelated"" to the resolution. ""There are no plans to change this policy, Smith said. Still, Smith said, ""Any policy of the Boy Scouts can be changed."" The Boy Scout organization, which celebrated its 100th birthday in 2010, says its main focus continues to be mentoring 2.8 million young men and helping them develop life skills. ""We do not have an agenda on this issue,"" Smith said. ""Our membership policy is not meant to be a blanket statement on a group of people or social commentary."" Application forms do not ask information about sexual orientation, the spokesman said, adding that clergy and family are better venues for discussion. ""This (scouting) is not the place to reconcile diverging viewpoints."" Smith acknowledged that members of the Scouts' 300 councils have varying opinions. ""There has always been an open dialogue about this in scouting."" CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","Scout committee will study resolution on its membership policies .

"(CNN) -- They're rich, powerful and P.O.'d. One of them is BFF with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. And they're putting President Obama on notice: stop the Keystone XL oil pipeline or else. Or else what? Well it depends on who you ask. Take Susie Tompkins Buell, for instance. She's a major Democratic Party fundraiser and co-founder of Esprit clothing company. This is a woman who's used to hosting political fundraisers and entertaining multimillionaires. She's often described as one of Clinton's closest friends -- donating to her 2008 presidential campaign. Back then, she led a group of holdout Clinton supporters before finally throwing her support to Obama after the '08 Democratic convention. On Tuesday, Buell could have been rubbing shoulders with the president at a swanky $5,000-a-plate luncheon. Instead, she joined an estimated 1,000 people out in the street protesting against the pipeline. ""If he doesn't oppose this, I certainly could not get behind him in a big way,"" she said Thursday. Over the years, she guesses she has raised more than $1 million for Democratic causes and candidates. Will she be helping out Obama's re-election? ""I'm doing fundraisers for several people coming up in the next few months, but the (Obama campaign) hasn't asked me, and I haven't volunteered -- and I don't know what's to come, I really don't."" Buell wasn't the only rich and powerful political donor at Tuesday's demonstration. Michael Kieschnick, president and co-founder of CREDO Mobile and Working Assets, was there, too. Obama's decision, he said, ""will really be the clearest most unambiguous statement of whether or not he cares about protecting the Earth as he said in his campaign."" Keystone XL is a proposed 1,700-mile pipeline that would carry crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to refineries in Texas. Environmentalists fear the pipeline will poison underground water supplies. Pipeline operator TransCanada says the project would pose no threat, create jobs and spur the sagging economy. Obama has said the decision whether to begin pipeline construction rests with the State Department, but opponents say the final call is in the president's hands. The administration's decision is expected before the end of the year. Buell said she's spoken about the Keystone issue recently with her friend the secretary of State at a social gathering a few weeks ago. ""She knows that it's important for the people to speak out,"" Buell said. In 2010, Clinton said the State Department had not yet completed its analysis of the pipeline's environmental effects, but it was ""inclined"" to ""sign off"" on the project. At the demonstration Buell, who has seven grandchildren, held a poster that said, ""Another outraged grandmother against the pipeline."" ""I don't say that I know President Obama, but I've had several conversations with him,"" Buell said. ""I feel that the environment is not a priority for him, and it should be."" Obama re-election campaign press secretary Ben LaBolt wouldn't respond directly to Buell's comments, but he did offer a written statement that said, ""The president has done more to wean us off of foreign oil and transition the nation to a clean energy economy than any other -- investing in renewable energy and high-speed rail, building a smart grid and reaching a historic agreement with the automakers on fuel economy standards that will save us from importing millions of barrels of oil from the Middle East. When Americans compare the president's record promoting clean energy and America's energy security to those of the leading Republican candidates, who don't even believe that climate change is an issue that we need to address and would cede the clean energy market to China, there will be no question about who will continue our progress."" Political test . The environmental community sees the Keystone pipeline as more than a threat to water in the heartland. They see it as a political test of Obama's 2008 campaign promise to cut U.S. dependence on polluting fossil fuels and to slow climate change. Allowing the project to move forward, they say, makes a statement that the White House is willing to bow to the wishes of the powerful oil industry. Kieschnick's business has donated $5 million to groups that oppose the pipeline. A self-described ""big and enthusiastic"" Obama supporter in 2008, Kieschnick said he made $4,400 in personal donations to the president's first campaign. He also was among 1,200 pipeline protesters who were arrested outside the White House last summer. But Kieschnick hasn't given up hope. He still has a photo of himself with Obama hanging on his office wall. Ex-Obama environment adviser arrested in pipeline protest . Basically, he says, if the pipeline starts going, the money stops flowing. ""I would still vote for him, and I would work to defeat his opponents,"" Kieschnick said, ""but nothing more."" It's not the first time disgruntled Democrats have threatened to withhold their support for Obama. During debt ceiling negotiations with Congress in July, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee demanded that the president press Congress to raise taxes on higher income earners and protect entitlements -- or else lose the committee's support. Members of the group threatened not to contribute to or volunteer for the president's re-election campaign unless the White House met its demands. Last summer, the liberal group MoveOn.org, which supported Obama in 2008, expressed frustration with the president over what it said was his inability to hold firm against Republicans in debt ceiling battles and on environmental issues. Environmentalists acknowledge the White House has made some positive steps, including new vehicle fuel efficiency standards aimed at saving energy and cutting pollution. But if Obama allows Keystone to go forward, they say there will be political repercussions. Donors like IT consultant David desJardins say the campaign will have a hard time motivating its base in an election where turnout may be critical. ""Even if the Sierra Club says we should still go out and support the president, people will say, 'Why should we do that when he didn't stand up for us when he really had the chance?'"" In 2008, ex-Google software engineer and philanthropist desJardins watched from the audience as Obama delivered his nomination acceptance speech promising to fight climate change and pollution. Now Keystone offers a chance for ""Obama to do the right thing, and then give a great speech about how we need to stop investing in environmental degradation and nonrenewable energy sources and start investing instead in renewable energy,"" desJardins said. ""Then I would certainly be inspired to make a contribution."" Protest organizers admit their message has been overshadowed somewhat by the nationwide Occupy Wall Street protests. But rather than compete for media attention, the two groups have been helping each other to some extent, joining forces at protests and offering moral support, organizers said. Nonetheless, the anti-Keystone groups are preparing a new demonstration set for November 6, a year before Election Day, when thousands of pipeline opponents plan to form a human circle around the White House.","Campaign donors to Obama: Stop oil pipeline .

"(CNN) -- In Haiti, actor Sean Penn brushed aside mockery in the media for his penchant for taking up causes. Someone, he said, had to do something after the devastating earthquake. Now he's being recognized for his efforts. Penn will be presented with the 2012 Peace Summit Award next month during the annual meeting of Nobel Peace Prize laureates. Every year, the Nobel Laureates honor a cultural or entertainment personality who has promoted peace and stood up for human rights. The laureates are honoring Penn's work in 2010, when he left Hollywood glamor behind and set up shop on the slopes of a private golf club in Port-au-Prince, where thousands of homeless Haitians sought shelter under makeshift tents. The charitable organization he founded, J/P Haitian Relief Organization, managed the camp of 50,000 people, helping with food, sanitation and health care. He insisted then that he would be there for the long haul; that he was more than a celebrity goodwill ambassador who dropped in to smile with orphaned kids for a day. ""Pretty soon, we were managing a camp,"" he said in 2010. ""Then you find you are filling a gap and you feel responsibility to keep going."" His aid agency is still in Haiti, working, it says, to lift Haiti out of poverty. The Oscar-winning Penn, star of ""Dead Man Walking,"" ""Mystic River"" and ""Milk,"" said he was grateful to be honored by the Nobel laureates. ""It's difficult to properly respond to this while avoiding cliche,"" he said. ""I'm thrilled to receive this tribute and to represent it to the youth of Haiti, the strong women of Haiti, and of the world. ""Many in my generation know cowardice well, but not the youth, and not the women. And never the Haitians,"" he said. Haiti was hardly Penn's first humanitarian endeavor, though it was arguably his most ambitious project to date. A few years back, he traveled to Iraq and Iran and wrote about both countries for the San Francisco Chronicle. He was in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina -- his right arm bears a tattoo that says: ""NOLA, Deliver Me."" His presence in Haiti and all those other places drew skepticism from those who think that celebrities use tragedies to burnish their public images. But Penn moved forward, undeterred, with his relief work in Haiti. Past winners of the Peace Summit Award include musician Bob Geldof and actor and director Roberto Benigni. The Chicago summit in April will bring together Nobel laureates from 17 nations.","Sean Penn will receive the Peace Summit Award for his relief work in Haiti .

"Washington (CNN) -- Forget political pedigree, executive experience or ties to deep-pocketed donors. No Republican presidential candidate is better positioned to capitalize on the recent tide of conservative anger toward President Barack Obama than Michele Bachmann. Her charisma and crossover appeal to both social and fiscal conservatives have the three-term Minnesota congresswoman rising in the polls and primed to make a serious impact on the GOP nomination fight. Bachmann, unlike several of her rivals making appeals to the Tea Party movement, has the resources and fundraising potential to steer her campaign beyond the crucial early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Though firmly on the insurgent side of the Republican field, she is also taking steps to position herself as a credible alternative to the crop of establishment-friendly White House contenders with deep pockets and long political resumes. She has hired Sarah Palin's debate coach. She nabbed Haley Barbour's pollster. And Bachmann's campaign organization will be based not in Minnesota, but in Washington, where the coming battle on Capitol Hill over raising the debt ceiling will place her squarely in the middle of the national political debate this summer. Most her rivals, now out of office, will be watching from the sidelines. The question of whether Bachmann can ride these advantages all the way to the Republican nomination will begin to be answered on Monday in Iowa, where she formally launches her presidential bid in Waterloo. That Bachmann was born in Waterloo and lived there until age 12 is fortuitous. Iowa, political observers say, is now key to Bachmann's chances of becoming president. ""The bad news for Bachmann is that she has to win Iowa,"" said Republican strategist Curt Anderson, who is not aligned with any 2012 campaign. ""Without it her campaign is over. The good news for Bachmann is that she can win Iowa."" That much is true. A Des Moines Register poll released over the weekend confirmed what many Iowa Republicans have been proclaiming for months: That barring a late entry into the race by a high-profile conservative like Palin or Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Bachmann might be the Iowa frontrunner. Bachmann captured the support of 22% of likely caucus-goers in the survey, putting her just one percentage point behind former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the GOP frontrunner who does not plan to compete as seriously in Iowa as he did during the 2008 race. No other candidate came close to that level of support, including Texas Rep. Ron Paul, former Sen. Rick Santorum, businessman Herman Cain or former House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- all candidates who, like Bachmann, are angling for support among Tea Party activists and social conservatives. Strikingly, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who has campaigned in Iowa for more than a year but has struggled to gain traction, took just 6%. With her showing in the Register poll and an eye-opening performance in the New Hampshire Republican presidential debate earlier this month, the expectations for Bachmann in Iowa are climbing. With little more than seven months until the caucuses, her staff must work to keep them in check. ""The expectations are rising for her,"" said Ed Brookover, one of Bachmann's closest advisers. ""She has to meet or beat expectations, whatever those are next February."" While Bachmann's team smartly refuses to call Iowa a ""must-win,"" they acknowledge that a strong showing in the caucuses is crucial for her campaign. ""The primary process is sort of like the NCAA tournament,"" Brookover said. ""You have to survive and advance. That's what you have to do in these early states in order to do well. That's a long way of saying Iowa is pretty important for her."" Bachmann has yet to do the kind of face-to-face campaigning that Iowans demand, though that will quickly change as the campaign gets underway. Meanwhile, her staff has been busy laying the groundwork for a competitive race. Her congressional chief of staff, Andy Parrish, re-located to Des Moines in early June. Iowa state Sen. Kent Sorenson, a popular figure among Iowa Tea Party activists, will chair her campaign. Wes Enos, the political director behind Mike Huckabee's surprising second place finish in the 2007 Ames Straw Poll, is taking on a similar role for Bachmann ahead of this year's poll, scheduled for August 13. Out of the view of the media, there is also behind-the-scenes work underway to win over the kind of hard-to-reach grassroots activists who often play an outsized role in the caucuses. Bachmann, for instance, has lined up the backing of influential home-school activist Barb Heki, a board member of the Network of Iowa Christian Home Educators who assisted Huckabee's winning caucus effort in 2008 and helped the conservative effort to oust three judges from the Iowa Supreme Court last year. In private meetings in recent months, Bachmann has won over influential faith leaders across the state, including Brad Cranston, the pastor of Heritage Baptist Church in Burlington. Cranston runs a group called ""Iowa Baptists for Biblical Values,"" a loose network of pastors from around the state. He recalled meeting with Santorum, Paul and Pawlenty early in the presidential process, but said that Bachmann was the only Republican who spoke convincingly about ""the moral issues"" that faith-minded voters in Iowa hold dear. ""Michele is what she claims to be,"" said Cranston, who manages an e-mail database of politically active churchgoers. ""She will bring the conservative and Christian perspectives back to where they need to be. She will find a lot of support among religious conservatives in the state as things move forward. I think she has it already."" The challenge for Bachmann's staff if they hope to win more than just Iowa is to broaden her appeal beyond just the conservative activists who seem to have gravitated to her early. Bachmann must defend a thin record during three terms in the Washington, where she is known more for her frequent cable news appearances than for any significant legislative achievement aside from creating the House Tea Party Caucus. And, as aides to her Republican rivals like to point out, her tendency toward gaffes and conspiratorial claims about the president would be problematic, if not fatal, in a general election. Bachmann seems to be aware of this fact, which is why she has assembled a team of veteran political operatives to manage her campaign. She hired Ed Rollins, who directed Ronald Reagan's landslide re-election bid in 1984 and managed Huckabee's 2008 effort, to run her operation. Along with loyal advisers like Brookover and fundraising consultant Guy Short, Bachmann has brought on top flight Republican talent like pollster Ed Goeas, who was working with Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour before he declined to seek the nomination, and former George W. Bush and McCain message maven Brett O'Donnell, who coached Palin before her high-stakes vice presidential debate in 2008. Also aiding Bachmann: veteran consultant Bob Heckman, who has deep ties to the conservative movement, former McCain campaign web guru Becki Donatelli, and Tom McGill, a fundraiser for President George W. Bush's 2004 campaign and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's 2008 bid. When asked ""Why Michele Bachmann?,"" a common theme emerges in discussions with her advisers, some of whom might have been comfortable working for a more traditional candidate like Pawlenty or Romney. Their argument, as simple as it sounds, is that Bachmann is the only candidate in the field who truly understands the issues and impulses of the Republican voter at a very unconventional moment in American politics. ""After the first debate performance it was obvious that people responded to her in such an overwhelming way,"" said Rex Elsass, her Ohio-based media consultant. ""There was a sense that finally someone was speaking to the heart and the core of the party.""","Bachmann is scheduled to launch her presidential bid formally on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Small arms fire targeted U.N. monitors in Syria as they tried to get to the scene of another massacre, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Thursday. No one was hit, said a spokeswoman for Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, head of the U.N. Supervision Mission in Syria. The incident came as Ban, international envoy Kofi Annan and others implored the U.N. General Assembly to stop the violence in Syria, which started 15 months ago when a tough Syrian crackdown against peaceful protesters developed into an uprising. The latest massacre occurred on Wednesday in the village of Qubeir, west of Hama, and included reports that dozens of civilians, including women and children, were killed. Massacre details are eerily familiar . Ban said the U.N. monitors had been denied access to the area but were working to get to the scene. ""I just learned a few minutes ago that while trying to do so, the U.N. monitors were shot at by small arms,"" he said. Mood said observers heading to the village to verify reports of the killings had been blocked by soldiers and civilians. Residents told observers they would be at risk if they were to enter the village. ""Despite these challenges, the observers are still working to get into the village to try to establish the facts on the ground,"" Mood said. ""UNSMIS is concerned about the restriction imposed on its movement as it will impede our ability to monitor, observe and report."" Annan, the joint U.N.-Arab League special envoy tasked with forging peace in Syria, told assembly members Thursday that Syrians could face worse troubles if peace isn't made. Speaking before the U.N. General Assembly, Annan said his six-point plan isn't working and the ""crisis is escalating."" ""If things do not change, the future is likely to be one of brutal repression, massacres, sectarian violence and even all-out civil war,"" Annan said. ""All Syrians will lose."" The violence is worsening and the country is becoming more polarized and radicalized, he said. ""Despite the acceptance of the six-point plan and the deployment of a courageous mission of United Nations observers to Syria, I must be frank and confirm that the plan is not being implemented,"" he added. Annan said Arab League ministers he addressed Saturday had ""offered concrete ideas on how to increase pressure for compliance."" ""Clearly, the time has come to determine what more can be done to secure implementation of the plan and/or what other options exist to address the crisis,"" he said. He spoke in the wake of the killings in Qubeir and, two weeks ago, in Houla. More than 100 people, including women and children, were killed in Houla. Opposition activists blamed government forces and allied militia, an assertion denied by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ""Those responsible for perpetrating these crimes must be held to account,"" Annan said. ""We cannot allow mass killing to become part of everyday reality in Syria."" Militia does regime's 'dirty work,"" analysts say . He said he urged al-Assad nine days ago to ""change his military posture and honor his commitments to the six-point plan."" But Assad ""believed the main obstacle was the actions of militants,"" Annan said. ""Clearly, all parties must cease violence. But equally clearly, the first responsibility lies with the government."" Though Syria has released some detainees and there has been agreement ""on modalities for humanitarian assistance,"" more is required, Annan said. Since he and Assad spoke, ""shelling of cities has intensified"" and ""government-backed militia has free rein with appalling consequences."" Annan said armed opposition forces haven't seen a ""reason to respect cessation of hostilities"" and ""have intensified their attacks."" Referring to bombings in Damascus and Aleppo, he said the situation is ""made more complex"" by attacks that are ""indicative of the presence of a third actor."" Some analysts say jihadist groups are responsible for those acts. Annan called for ""consequences if compliance is not forthcoming,"" and said ""a clearer course for a peaceful transition"" must be charted to resolve the crisis. Annan was to address the Security Council in New York. Syrian Ambassador to the U.N. Bashar Jaafari reiterated that anti-government terrorists, and not the regime, are responsible for the bloodshed. The government said terrorists timed the latest massacre to coincide with the U.N. meetings in order to make the regime look bad. He added that Syria ""is ready to receive an investigation committee from neutral countries that respect the U.N. charter and reject any intervention in the Syrian affairs,"" according to the government's Syrian Arab News Agency. Jaafari said Syria is open to reform and to dialogue, and that it has no problem with the opposition. However, he said, some opposition forces composed of outside elements are taking up arms and have no desire for reconciliation. Opposition activists accuse forces loyal to al-Assad of the killings at Qubeir, and they placed the number of dead at 78. Regime forces shelled Qubeir before militias used knives, guns and AK-47 rifles to kill residents, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. About 40 victims of the attack were buried in a mass grave Thursday, according to a youth activist whom CNN is not naming for safety reasons. Shabiha -- or pro-government gangs -- took other bodies to neighboring villages, the activist said. More than half of those killed were women and children, said a local activist who reported having carried bodies. CNN cannot independently confirm reports from within Syria because the government limits access by international journalists. The recent violence has revived calls to isolate the regime and toughen sanctions. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, meeting Thursday in Istanbul with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, called the latest violence ""simply unconscionable."" She reiterated the U.S. stance that al-Assad must go and the international community must unite around a plan for Syria after al-Assad. Clinton said it is important to give Annan's peace initiative ""the last amount of support we can muster."" Davutoglu, whose country has been critical of the al-Assad regime's actions, said all members of the U.N. Security Council must work together to stop the regime's actions. China and Russia, regime allies, have stressed their opposition to outside interference in Syria while continuing to back Annan's plan. As permanent Security Council members, the two nations have used their veto powers to block draft resolutions against the regime. Meeting Thursday in Shanghai, leaders of Russia, China and four Central Asian nations signed a statement opposing outside intervention in Syria. The statement calls for ""dialogues that respect Syria's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity."" China, Russia call for non-intervention . The United States plans to send a delegation to Russia this week to press for tough action against the Syrian regime, a senior State Department official said. At least 15 people were killed Thursday in Syria, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The United Nations for months has said more than 9,000 people have died in Syria. But death counts from opposition groups range from more than 12,000 to more than 14,000. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced.

"(Mashable) -- Sometimes you just want to read. Digital's best answer for that simple urge is the now venerable E Ink e-reader. These monochromatic devices are not only holding on in the face of stiff LCD-based tablet competition, they're innovating. The latest update comes from Barnes & Noble, which added an LED-based ""GlowLight"" to its Nook Simple Touch e-reader. The 6.5 x 5-inch device is not remarkably different from the e-reader Barnes & Noble introduced last year. Its dimensions are, in fact, virtually unchanged. But despite the new lighting tech, this reader is actually 5% lighter than the previous model. It's also somewhat lighter than Amazon's Kindle Touch (6.975 ounces versus 7.5 ounces). Both Wi-Fi-only readers cost $139. You can get the Amazon Kindle Touch for $99, but then you have to accept special offers (essentially ads) in place of the screen savers. More importantly, the Simple Touch price includes the power adapter, while Kindle sells it separately for approximately $15. Still, what truly sets the latest Nook Simple Touch apart from all other E Ink-based e-readers is the patent-pending GlowLight. It makes the lightweight reader ready for night reading without the need for an overhead, clip-on or external light. By contrast, Amazon sells a cover with a built-in LED light for the Kindle Keyboard 3G. Barnes & Noble is not the first to offer an E Ink reader with built-in LED lighting. Sony did it first a few years ago, but eventually discontinued the larger and more expensive e-reader. The Simple Touch uses a single array of LED's nestled along the top edge of the device (above the screen, but below the touch-sensitive, anti-glare layer). They light the entire display. I put the ereader to the ultimate test: bedtime reading. My wife, who was beside me, read by the super-bright light of her Apple iPad 2. I held the much smaller ereader in my hand, and pressed the physical Nook ""n"" button for two seconds to enable the light . Nook Simple Touch's GlowLight is adjustable, via a touch-screen menu selection. So I cranked it all the way up (the default, which was set to about 1/3 power, was not bright enough for me). The light across the screen isn't perfectly uniform, but it is highly readable and very comfortable on the eyes. Even after my wife powered down and went to sleep, she didn't complain about my GlowLight. I also found the touchscreen, which works either with a tap or a sweep of the finger (forward to turn the page and back to turn back the page), worked perfectly and made me wish my Kindle 2 was also a touch-screen device. Barnes & Noble promises that the Nook Simple Touch's battery life will last for 30 days with an hour of GlowLight-enabled reading a night. I've had the ereader a few days and charged it once. My original plan was to leave the GlowLight running and test if it could run, as Barnes & Noble told me, for 60 continuous hours. The device's own auto-sleep settings scuttled that plan by putting the Simple Touch to sleep after five minutes of inactivity. Overall, Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight is a winner. It's easy to setup (entering a Wi-Fi password is easy thanks to the touch screen), feels great in the hand, slips into my back pocket and holds thousands of books. The interface is smartly designed. I like the store design and how easy it is to buy things (pretty much a match for the Kindle store) and found the E Ink screen crisp and responsive. My only tiny criticism is the power button on the back. You use it to fully turn off the device (and turn it on) and it wiggles a bit too much for my taste. The good news is that, considering the battery life, it's unlikely you'll use it very often. If I were buying a new E Ink reader right now, I'd go for the Barnes & Noble Simple Touch with GlowLight. It's slightly more affordable than the Kindle Touch (when you include the charger), feature-sensible and now has the killer enhancement: a built-in light. Those who pre-ordered the e-reader could receive it as early as this week. Barnes & Noble reps tell us that limited quantities of the Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight will be available in stores next month. What do you think? Would you buy this E Ink e-reader or have you permanently moved on to tablets? Share your thoughts in the comments. See the original article on Mashable.com . © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- A typhoon off the coast of the Philippines is fueling monsoon rains, which flooded the capital city of Manila and could trigger flash floods and landslides, forecasters said on Wednesday. The Philippine government said Typhoon Kabayan was expected to enhance the monsoon over the entire island of Luzon, where Manila is located, according to the country's National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council. The storm system has maximum winds of 102 mph (165 kph) and gusts over 124 mph (200 kph), the council reported. It is forecast to be about 100 miles off the coast of Okinawa, Japan, by Thursday evening. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said that the western part of Luzon will experience monsoon rains on Wednesday, which could cause flash floods and landslides. The typhoon was reported to be some 656 miles (1,055 km) east-northeast of Basco, Batanes early Wednesday morning. Government officials said relief goods have been positioned in areas that could be affected by the typhoon, according to the Philippines News Agency. Officials suspended government work and college classes Tuesday because of the heavy rains, the agency said. Veronica Lon, a CNN iReporter, said about 35% of metropolitan Manila is submerged under water and hundreds of families are in evacuation centers. ""This is a unusual scene in our city and always, it only takes a few minutes for the flood to form,"" Lon said. ""More than half the city and about 75% of metro Manila area had floods,"" she said.","NEW: Flash floods and landslides are possible, forecasters say .

"Jamam refugee camp, South Sudan (CNN) -- The dried up cattle pond is only a few meters off the red road that runs through Jamam refugee camp. It's a huge hole in the ground, long emptied by the blazing sun. At the bottom of this pit women and children dig with cups and bowls in the smelly, spongy mud for the little dirty water that seeps into their shallow wells. Jamam refugee camp is in a desperate situation. All day Oxfam trucks water from the very few working boreholes in or near the camp to tanks close to the road. Women wait in the heat for up to four hours twice a day, next to their long queues of buckets and jerry cans. Men with sticks and whips police the lines. Fights break out all the time. No one has to ask why. There is simply not enough water and we are running out of options and we are running out of time. This is the daily struggle that is the human face of peace failing in the Sudans. The conflict in Blue Nile has been going on for months, and now in the past few weeks fighting between Sudan and South Sudan threatens to further destabilize the wider border region these refugees still live in. Like a cruel reminder of the conflict that the refugees fled, unidentified Antonovs -- the kind of planes that bombed their villages in Blue Nile -- flew over Jamam camp three times in the past few weeks. In a panic, refugees ran and sought safety in holes in the ground. To truly understand why peace is so important, the world needs to remember it's not just the fighting that matters but also the enormous suffering it causes those who have already been forced to flee it. The interrupted lives, deadened by displacement in the hot, unblinking heat. In barely established camps like Jamam there's nothing to do but wait. In Jamam -- where water is rationed well below people's needs, enough only for cooking and bathing - that struggle has become a crisis that is about to deepen as the rainy season approaches. How to get enough water? That is the burning question, but the ground here has few answers. There is just not enough water to cope with so many new people -- and now there are fears that more may arrive as conflict spreads. We've done a hydro-geological survey and we've drilled for new boreholes. We have even resorted to water divining -- a traditional method using metal rods in the hope of detecting ground water. Only one drill has produced any water, but very little. We were completely reliant on four overworked boreholes pumping 22 hours a day. One of these collapsed last week, and now there are just three. Rationing has been tightened again. It was a grim evening in our base in the camp that night. We ate our meal to the loud hum of the generator with our hearts in our stomachs. The refugees were settled here partly because the host community was welcoming. But as water sources run out or dry up and more and more refugees arrive, competition for water is beginning to cause conflict here too. Fights break out at water points. The pressure is intense and I fear it will get worse. The heavy rains are coming, bringing fresh problems. It rained last week for three hours, long enough to destroy many of the flimsy shelters of plastic sheeting, sheets, or straw the refugees have constructed under trees. Whole families were left exposed. The rains will flood large parts of the camp, bringing the threat of disease and making trucking water in very difficult -- perhaps impossible as the roads deteriorate into impassable mud slicks. Drilling in the rains is also near impossible. It is hard to express how miserable the mud of Upper Nile is. It's a kind of black clay that sticks to everything, the stuff of quagmires. Largely impermeable, water sits on top of it, a massive health risk not just encouraging malaria but also water-borne diseases including cholera. Humanitarian agencies working in the camp are looking into options including relocating a large number of the refugees to a new site, and putting in a pipeline that will hopefully mean the water can reach the camp more reliably when the roads fall apart. But there's only one real solution. People need peace and people need to be able to go home. Unless all parties involved in the fighting stop and focus on long-term peace then I fear that the situation in Sudan and South Sudan will reverse to how it was during wartime, Africa's longest civil war, the most recent phase of which lasted 22 years and left around 2 million people dead. All that progress made in the years following the 2005 peace agreement risks being lost. The international community played a major role in brokering that peace -- now is the time to make sure it lasts. The people in Jamam, and across the two countries, deserve to be free from the constant threat of crisis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pauline Ballaman.","Hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled conflict in Sudan, South Sudan border region .

"(CNN) -- Iraq has executed a high-ranking aide to the late ruler Saddam Hussein, a government spokesman said Thursday. The Justice Ministry carried out the execution of Abid Hamid Mahmud al-Tikriti, who was Hussein's personal secretary, national security adviser and senior bodyguard, spokesman Ali a-Dabbagh said. Al-Tikriti was the ""ace of diamonds"" in the U.S. military's card deck of 55 most-wanted Iraqis. He was No. 4 on the list, behind Hussein and his sons Uday and Qusay. He and members of Hussein's special security forces were captured in a 2003 raid by U.S. Special Operations Forces near the north-central Iraq town of Tikrit. The Iraqi High Tribunal had sentenced al-Tikriti to death for genocide and crimes against humanity. The 2003 U.S.-led invasion toppled Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime. Hussein was hanged in December 2006 after being found guilty of crimes against humanity in the killings of Shiite villagers in 1982.","Abid Hamid Mahmud al-Tikriti was Saddam Hussein's national security adviser .

"(CNN) -- Tonight, Tuesday, June 5, as the sun set on the East Coast, the planet Venus began its ""transit"" across the face of the sun. Pay close attention: Barring a miracle of future medicine, this is your only chance to witness such a crossing. The next one will take place in 2117. That's because the transit of Venus is basically an eclipse, just like when the moon passes across the face of the sun. It requires a close alignment of the sun, Venus and Earth. The moon is not nearly as large as Venus but it is so close to Earth that its disk covers nearly the entire solar disk. Venus, on the other hand, is so far away that it appears as a small black dot covering about 3% of the solar disk. Venus orbits the sun every 226 Earth-days, compared to our 365 days, so the two planets sort of pass each other relatively often. But their orbits lie in slightly canted planes, so the alignment needed for an eclipse happens only once a century or so. Nearly 500 years ago, Johannes Kepler figured out the orbits of the planets. He understood that Venus was 30% closer to the sun than Earth, and that Mars was 50% more distant. But he didn't know how to measure the distance from any planet to the sun. A century after Kepler, Edmund Halley, of comet fame, proposed measuring the distance from Earth to the sun using a series of observations of the transit of Venus from widely separated points on Earth. Halley did not live to measure the next transit of Venus, in 1761, but others mounted worldwide expeditions that did the trick. The best measurements of that transit were made by Jeremiah Dixon and Charles Mason, of Mason-Dixon-line fame. Today, we can measure interplanetary distances far more accurately than the transit method allows, though amateurs can still contribute their measurements using an app from Astronomers Without Borders. As for the specialness of the transit, well, it's rarer than passages of Mr. Halley's famous comet. The transit of Venus can't be observed with the Hubble Space Telescope because the extreme brightness of the sun would destroy the telescope and its instruments. But astronomers have figured out a clever way for Hubble to ""observe"" the effects of the transit on the light from the sun: by looking at the moon. The moon ""shines"" in reflected sunlight, so it is basically a weak mirror that is safe for Hubble to observe. The reason astronomers want to observe reflected sunlight during the transit of Venus is to test whether they can detect the faint imprint of passage of the sun's light through the atmosphere of Venus. They have used similar observations of more distant stars to find ""exoplanets"" (planets orbiting stars other than the sun) and in a few rare cases, to measure characteristics of the exoplanet atmospheres. The goal of the Hubble observations is to find signs of life and/or habitability, such as water or carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Hubble will focus its cameras on the moon for the full six hours of the transit of Venus. So the transit of Venus is now being used to help us learn about other Solar Systems. Venus is the second closest planet to the sun, after Mercury; Earth is third; Mars is fourth. That means only Mercury and Venus (and our moon) can cause eclipses from a vantage point on the Earth. But if we lived on Jupiter, Earth and Mars could also be seen (rarely!) transiting across the sun. Here is the poor man's way to ""see"" the transit of the Earth across the sun: look with the Hubble Space Telescope at Jupiter in 2014, to see the reflected light of the sun from Jupiter's surface. (The light falling on Jupiter, and being reflected from there, is what we would see if we lived on Jupiter. The sun is too bright for Hubble to observe directly.) Those Hubble measurements would reveal whether signs of life on Earth -- signs of us! -- are detectable in starlight as a planet with an atmosphere transits across the star. Drake Deming, professor at the University of Maryland, points out that Earth can be seen transiting the sun from many vantage points throughout our galaxy. If there is intelligent life out there, maybe it is looking for signs of life on Earth from such transits. You may have witnessed the last transit of Venus in 2004. But the one before that was visible only to your great-great-grandparents, on December 6, 1882. As William Harkness (1837-1903), then director of the U.S. Naval Observatory, said on the eve of the 1882 transit: ""There will be no other transits of Venus 'til the 21st century of our era has dawned upon the Earth. When the last transit occurred the intellectual world was awakening from the slumber of ages, and that wondrous scientific activity, which has led to our present advanced knowledge, was just beginning. What will be the state of science when the next transit season arrives God only knows. Not even our children's children will live to take part in the astronomy of that day."" You are in that day, another age of wondrous scientific activity. What will the world of your great-great grandchildren be like in 2117? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","Meg Urry says we should take the chance to view Venus' transit .

"(CNN) -- When Mitt Romney sits across from the Fraternal Order of Police to seek their presidential endorsement, I can't wait to hear his reaction to these men and women carrying guns and tasers when they ask him to explain why he doesn't think the nation needs more of them on the streets. Mr. Rich Guy sounded like a completely out-of-touch guy when, in an effort to slam President Barack Obama's news conference on the economy, said: ""He wants another stimulus, he wants to hire more government workers. He says we need more firemen, more policemen, and more teachers. Did he not get the message of Wisconsin? The American people did. It's time for us to cut back on government and help the American people."" Last I checked, teachers, firefighters and police officers are Americans. In fact, if you have ever had your home broken into, I'm sure the last thing you want the 911 operator to tell you is they will have to schedule a cop to drop by as if he's an air conditioner repairman. When your house is going up in flames, I doubt there would be many chuckles if the 911 operator says, ""Mitt Romney says you should be happy to have a smaller government, so we won't be able to send someone to put out the fire until Monday morning. Good luck."" This is the kind of ignorance that gets passed off to us as smart political thinking. Trust me, I get the whole argument of downsizing government. But people like Mitt Romney act as if the essential services that makes our neighborhoods, towns, cities and states run isn't done by government employees. Need that trash picked up? Yeah, it smells a bit funky, but suck it up, Mitt says we can get by with fewer garbage collectors. Tired of that pothole? Don't complain. Just drive around it since we don't have the manpower to get them fixed in a timely manner. It's real easy to take shots at government, but when it comes to determining what is essential to our daily lives, we must have a different conversation. When you're a rich guy like Romney, public school teachers mean nothing to you since you can afford to send your kids to private schools, hire tutors and enjoy those small classrooms. But if you're like most of ""the American people"" you can't stand overcrowded classrooms and few resources. But Romney doesn't care. Instead of separating the battle between union contracts and cities from actual people, he chose to make a ridiculous comment and dismiss the millions of hardworking Americans out there. That's even more laughable considering Republicans call themselves the law-and-order party, and are quick to tout their police endorsements. How many times have we seen Romney's party pals call New York firefighters heroes after 9/11. So, Mitt, should we not bother to expand the ranks of the men and women who keep us safe? Mitt doesn't have to worry about the Obama campaign or the Democratic Party running ads showing him to be an out-of-touch rich guy who doesn't care about blue-collar workers. We just have to wait for him to open his mouth. And we won't have to wait long. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Mitt Romney's slam on Obama's remarks was out of touch, says Roland Martin .

"(CNN) -- On New Year's Eve, husband and wife Tripp and Jessica Johnson will be wearing orange and blue and cheering their team in the Chick-fil-A Bowl -- from opposite sides of the stadium. The games features the Auburn University Tigers facing off against the University of Virginia Cavaliers, and both schools happen to share an orange and blue color scheme. Jessica went to Auburn, and Tripp is a UVA alum. The two first met in neutral territory, New York, when they both found themselves at a place known as the ""Auburn Bar"" to watch a game. Jessica went by choice, but Tripp was tagging along with a friend. Usually, this difference doesn't turn Jessica and Tripp from couple to rivals. The two football teams have played one another only two previous times -- in 1997 and 1998. But for two passionate football fans that are true to their schools, the bowl is turning theirs into a house divided. With bowl season in full swing, there will definitely be friends and families divided by the Rose, Orange, Sugar and Fiesta bowls and ultimately the BCS National Championship Game. No rivalry is worth starting a long-standing feud in the family, but it's fun to get into the spirit of collegiate loyalties. Because of the holidays and his dad's 60th birthday, Tripp's family is coming to town for the game. All of Tripp's siblings also went to UVA, so they bought tickets for the whole family. Jessica responded in kind by buying tickets so she can sit with her family on the Auburn side of the stadium. ""Neither of us are very good losers,"" she said. ""And that can make people pretty miserable."" No need for tensions and loyalties to clash on the father-in-law's birthday. If Virginia wins, her husband will bring it up ""forever."" ""If Auburn wins, I'll be a little mean that night, but Auburn really should beat them,"" she said. ""If they don't, I'll be embarrassed."" Get the latest college football news with Sports Illustrated . Betsy Glenday and her husband, Nigel, have also had some ""jabbing back and forth."" As it happens, Betsy and Jessica are friends, and both of them happened to marry men who went to the University of Virginia. But the biggest difference is Betsy's husband loves Auburn, and the two always watch Auburn games together. They may not be able to watch the bowl game, however, because the couple will be vacationing in Paris. When they found out the two schools would play one another in the bowl, they had already booked their trip. Betsy said there was no way they would change their tickets for a bowl game. But if they did, the couple would wear orange and blue, sit together, and her husband would probably bring a ""back-up Auburn hat,"" just in case. While Betsy doesn't have to worry about a football rivalry in her marriage, she is familiar with a house divided by an even deeper challenge: Auburn and the University of Alabama. Betsy's family enjoys the excitement of a good, long-standing rivalry, but never lets it go too far. Growing up in Alabama, her family watched all of the 'Bama games. But when Betsy was accepted to Auburn, things began to change. Her brothers followed suit, and soon Betsy, her father and her siblings were on the orange and blue side of the divide, while her mother and grandfather swore by the Crimson Tide. In the Southeastern Conference, rivalries divide houses and run deep in family blood. Auburn and Alabama play each other every year in the Iron Bowl -- the week of Thanksgiving. So each year, Betsy's mother goes the Alabama alumni bar to watch the game, while Betsy, her brothers and father go to the Auburn alumni bar. During halftime, whoever is losing has to visit the other bar and ""eat it"" for a little while. ""It may be Thanksgiving, but I'm going to talk back to my mom!"" Betsy said, laughing. Family will still be family, tensions will ease after the Iron Bowl, and the jokes and jabbing will be swapped in good fun. Because Virginia and Auburn have conflicting game times during the regular season, Jessica and Tripp managed to find a bar near their home in San Francisco that would broadcast both. As Jessica watched Auburn lose to the University of Georgia this year, Tripp was enjoying a game of UVA vs. Duke University. He invited her to come watch his game because Virginia was faring well. Despite Auburn's possible defeat, Jessica let him know that she ""didn't care about his stupid game."" If bowl season, or a good old-fashioned conference rivalry, is attempting to divide your house, Jessica has some tips for how ""not to kill each other."" ""Just have fun with it, and maybe go to separate places to watch the game if possible. But I'll tell you this, I wouldn't watch any games with him if he went to Alabama.""","Collegiate bowl season can divide couples because of their school loyalties .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City's faltering bid for a first English Premier League title in 44 years received a further setback on Saturday as they drew 3-3 with Sunderland at the Etihad Stadium. Two late goals ensured Roberto Mancini's team preserved their unbeaten home record in the league, but it means rivals Manchester United will go five points clear at the top of the table if they win at Blackburn Rovers on Monday. Sebastian Larsson put Sunderland ahead after half-an-hour before Mario Balotelli equalized from the penalty spot two minutes before the break after striker Edin Dzeko was brought down. But City soon found themselves behind again when striker Nicklas Bendtner headed home in first half injury time. Larsson got his second of the match 10 minutes after the break and City looked doomed to defeat as the match headed towards its climax. But two goals in two minutes -- Balotelli in the 85th followed by Aleksandar Kolarov -- ensured City came away with a point. Chelsea's quest to qualify for the Champions League received a boost as they beat Aston Villa 4-2 on an emotional day at Villa Park. Villa captain Stiliyan Petrov, who was diagnosed with acute leukemia on Friday, watched from the stands after receiving a standing ovation before the game. Petrov thanks fans for messages of support . Branislav Ivanovic scored twice (51st and 83rd minute) for the West Londoners after Daniel Sturridge had scored the game's opening goal in the ninth minute. Second-half goals from James Collins and American Eric Lichaj kept Villa in the hunt for a point, but Fernando Torres made sure of three points in injury time to keep the Blues in fifth spot, two points behind Tottenham who host Swansea City tomorrow. Muamba posts first photo . Arsenal's winning run came to an end in West London as they lost 2-1 to Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. Moroccan midfielder Adel Taarabt put the home side in front in the 22nd minute before Theo Walcott equalized for the Gunners eight minutes before halftime. But French midfielder Samba Diakite's 66th minute goal proved to be decisive to keep Mark Hughes' side 18th in the table with 28 points. Arsenal remain in third with 58 points. Fellow strugglers Wigan also won 2-0 at home to Stoke but Wolverhapton Wanderers miserable form continued as they went down 3-2 to Bolton at Molineux to leave them rooted to the bottom with 22 points.

"Rome (CNN) -- Rescuers searching the stricken Costa Concordia found a body on bridge 3 Tuesday, bringing the number of confirmed dead from the wreck to 16, civil protection officials said. The discovery leaves about 16 people still missing from among the roughly 4,200 aboard the cruise liner -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members -- at the time of the collision with rocks off the island of Giglio. The vast majority fled the ship safely, if under chaotic and frightening conditions, according to survivors. Undersea salvage experts will not start siphoning fuel off the partially sunken liner before Saturday, the man in charge of the operation said Tuesday. Teams of divers have begun to set up the operation, Franco Gabrielli said in remarks televised from Giglio. His comments appear to contradict a timetable laid out Monday by an Italian admiral, who said that salvage workers were to begin pumping fuel out of the liner that day. Adm. Ilarione Dell'Anna said it would take 28 working days to remove all the fuel from the ship. Gabrielli did not explain the discrepancy. He has asked the company that owns the ship to come up with a plan to clean up pollution from the vessel, such as garbage, by Wednesday, he said. The search for survivors and victims will continue alongside the salvage, said Gabrielli. The man in charge of the rescue operation said the divers faced a grim task. ""Imagine that you left for holidays and that the power went off in your house. What would you find in your fridge? The divers are in there,"" Ennio Aquilino said. Two bodies were found on Monday, and two more over the weekend -- one woman on Saturday and one on Sunday, both wearing life jackets. Divers used explosives Monday morning to blow more holes in the side of the ship to allow easier access. The parties involved in the rescue told reporters and residents on the island Sunday that search and rescue efforts will continue -- but that the environmental risk is also becoming urgent. Officials said they cannot predict how long it will take to clear the wreckage, since that depends on maritime conditions and technical difficulties, but all legal, environmental and human factors will be taken into account. ""It's time for Italy to show it can do something right and do it well,"" said Gabrielli. He warned that the task ahead was complicated and daunting, not least because it takes about 45 minutes to search each cabin, using special cameras and divers. The giant Costa Concordia had 1,500 cabins on board. A class-action lawsuit will be filed in Miami against Costa and its parent company, Carnival Corp., the Italian consumer group Codacons said Saturday. The suit, in collaboration with two U.S. law firms, is ""aimed specifically at getting compensation for all damages to the boat passengers,"" Codacons said in a statement. The class-action suit is open to passengers of any nationality, it said. ""We've been contacted by hundreds of victims and the numbers are growing moment by moment,"" said Mitchell Proner, senior partner at Proner & Proner, one of two firms involved. He said crew members have also contacted the firm, ""and their stories that are coming in are horrific -- from lifeboats that were stuck halfway, passengers debating whether to jump or not. This was not an orderly evacuation."" The suit, he said, will request at least 125,000 euros (about $160,000) per passenger. The suit has not yet been filed, said Marc Bern, senior partner at the other firm, Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik, but ""it will probably be in the billions of euros and dollars."" ""The sheer terror of being on a ship of that magnitude going down, you can imagine the psychological damage,"" Bern said. Meanwhile, Gabrielli said no fuel oil had yet leaked from the ship -- only kitchen and engine oil -- and that he did not see an immediate risk of the 2,400 tons on board escaping. Booms have been put in place around the ship to stop the spread of oil and other pollutants such as detergents and sewage chemicals. With more than 4,000 people aboard, the ship was the size of a small town, Gabrielli said. Fuel will be replaced with water as it is removed from the ship's tanks, keeping the ship balanced, said Dell'Anna, head of coastal authorities for the port city of Livorno. Gabrielli said Costa Cruises, the company that owns the cruise ship, is cooperative and was proving responsible, despite past errors. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Capt. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. Prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. Schettino maintains his innocence. CNN's Dan Rivers, Livia Borghese, Marilia Brocchetto, Vivian Kuo and journalist Barbie Nadeau contributed to this report.","NEW: A body is found on bridge 3, civil protection officials announce .

"(CNN) -- A glorious attacking display by Athletic Bilbao earned the Spanish side a 4-2 win at Schalke in the first leg of the Europa League quarterfinals at the Veltins Arena on Thursday. Fernando Llorente put Athletic ahead in the 20th minute poking the ball home after a Schalke goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand mishandled the ball. But the lead didn't last long with Spain's Raul latching onto a cross from Japan defender Atsuto Uchida to level the scores two minutes later. The veteran striker was on hand to score Schalke's second of the night and the goal of the match in the 60th minute as he smashed home a sensational 20-yard volley. A free-flowing game eventually yielded a fourth goal in the 73rd minute as Llorente headed home his second of the night with De Marcos firing Athletic ahead with nine minutes remaining. An injury-time counterattack earned the away side a fourth when Markel Susaeta unselfishly squared the ball to Iker Muniain who swept the ball past a helpless Mathias Schober -- who replaced the injured Hildebrand at halftime. It was also a good night for Atletico Madrid as they beat Hannover 2-1 at the Estadio Vicente Calderon. Colombian striker Falcao headed home from Gabi's free-kick to give the home side an early ninth minute lead before Mame Diouf put the German side back on level terms seven minutes before the break sliding in to meet a Lars Stindl cross. Falcao was involved in the winner, nodding down into the path of substitute Eduardo Salvio who then curled a shot past goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler. Spain's third representative in the quarterfinals, Valencia didn't fare so well, going down 2-1 away to Dutch side AZ Alkmaar. Australian striker Brett Holman put the home side ahead on the stroke of halftime with a deft side-foot volley from a corner kick. Valencia grabbed what could be a vital away goal six minutes after the break when Turkish international Mehmet Topal heading home from close range.

"(CNN) -- The Arab League was negotiating an extension of its fact-finding mission in Syria Thursday, with its members due to report over the weekend on what they have witnessed of a months-long government crackdown on protests. Ambassador Adnan Al Khudeir, the Cairo-based head of the monitoring operation, said the league and the Syrian government were negotiating an extension to their mandate, which was scheduled to end Thursday. A senior Arab League official, who could not be named because he was not authorized to speak on the matter, said the monitors would remain in Syria while the issue was discussed -- and that all signs pointed to an extension being agreed to by both sides. A handful of Arab League members will meet Saturday, led by Qatar, before the full 22-state body meets Sunday in Cairo to discuss the monitors' final findings, the official said. The United Nations is not sending monitors itself but is providing technical training to the Arab League observers, he added. The uprising, driven by calls for President Bashar al-Assad's resignation, reforms and democratic elections, is in its 10th month. It has prompted a bloody government crackdown that has claimed at least 5,000 lives since it began in March, according to the United Nations. Opposition groups put the death toll at more than 6,000. The Arab League has called on Damascus to stop violence against civilians, free political detainees, remove tanks and weapons from cities and allow outsiders, including the international news media, to travel freely around Syria. The purpose of its month-long fact-finding mission was to see if the government was adhering to an agreement to end the violence. But opposition activists and human rights monitors say the Syrian government has not stopped its aggressive actions against protesters since the mission began December 26, and have questioned the mission's effectiveness. Meanwhile, opposition activist groups continue to report outbreaks of violence elsewhere around the country. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition umbrella group, said 25 people were killed Thursday, including seven in Idlib, six in Hama and four in Homs. Four people were killed in Deir Ezzor and three in the Damascus suburbs, with one more death in Qameshly, the group said. Gunfire was reported in many neighborhoods in Hama, with mourners at a mosque also coming under fire. Some roads out of the city have been closed off, while snipers are positioned on rooftops, the LCC said. In Douma, a suburb of Damascus, the naked body of a young man bearing signs of torture was found in the street, the group said, adding that government security forces took the body and arrested several people. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights earlier said one civilian was killed and seven wounded in Homs Thursday by mortar rounds fired at the neighborhood of Baba Howd. Another four activists, who were in hiding, were shot dead in the Idlib region when security forces ambushed them in a mountain village, the Observatory said. The LCC said 21 people were killed by government troops Wednesday. The Arab League monitors have been greeted ecstatically in some Syrian cities, where residents have recounted tales of government brutality. In the town of Kisweh, which monitors visited Tuesday, one demonstrator spray-painted the letters ""S.O.S."" on a wall. On Sunday, crowds in Zabadani carried the monitors on their shoulders and urged them to stay to prevent reprisals. Syrian activists said Wednesday that opposition forces had wrested control of Zabadani from government troops. They maintained control of the city Thursday, activists said. ""There was massive protests in Zabadani, so the Syrian Army tried to disperse them. But our troops were very organized and aggressive with a counter attack that left them fleeing and they withdrew completely out of the city,"" said Lt. Col. Mohamed Hamdo of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a group made up of former government soldiers. ""Our forces raised the flag of independence in Zabadani."" Hamdo said, though, that the opposition fighters ""expect another confrontation"" as the government forces regroup outside the town. Although a number of journalists have been allowed into the country in recent days to travel with Arab League monitors on their fact-finding mission, CNN cannot verify many accounts of what is happening in Syria because the government restricts the activities of journalists. The European Union announced Wednesday it was planning new sanctions against companies and individuals in Syria, as it seeks to put pressure on the al-Assad regime. While Western powers have imposed sanctions on Syria during the 10-month crackdown, opposition by Russia and China has kept the U.N. Security Council from following suit. The al-Assad government says it is fighting armed terrorist groups, which it blames for the violence. CNN's Nic Robertson, Salma Abdelaziz, Lonzo Cook and Samira Said contributed to this report.","NEW: Opposition activists report 25 deaths across Syria Thursday .

"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- There is a predictable pattern that ensues following any tragic news in Nigeria. There is at first a collective sense of shock and grief. There follows official visits to the scene of the tragedy. Families are condoled and money is doled out in compensation. A period of mourning is inevitably announced. In a country where nothing happens quickly, committees and investigative panels will then be set up with remarkable alacrity. Months will pass. And then nothing. The result is always the same. Rhetoric, followed by vacuous proclamations but ultimately, inaction. The banal sequence has already begun playing out with news of Sunday's fatal air crash in Lagos which claimed over 150 lives. This time, however, Nigerians are demanding answers. Accidents do happen of course but the memories of January's mass protests are fresh and there lingers a suspicion of government negligence. It is far too early to determine the outcome of the crash but early indications are that this was an entirely avoidable disaster. See also: Nigerians no longer 'suffering and smiling' The investigation must begin with Dana Air, operators of the ill fated Boeing MD-83. The irony is that the Indian-owned airline has quite a decent track record since they began operations in Nigeria four years ago. With a modest number of four aircraft in its fleet, the airline had grown at a reasonable pace and had just taken delivery of another Boeing MD-83 in May. A strong focus on domestic services and competitive fares had seen Dana Air become the airline of choice for many regular fliers. There were signs, however, in the last six months that standards had begun to slip. First came the irregular take-off times. Dana flights, once paragons of punctuality, started taking off late or sometimes not at all. The delays were quite often without reason. On 15 May this year, I waited with other passengers for over six hours to board as engineers addressed a mechanical problem on one of its planes. On a separate occasion, we were to board the last Dana Flight out of Lagos to Abuja. The flight was canceled and no explanation given. There was no offer of compensation either. Dana Air has also faced accusations of penny-pinching. Even before Sunday's crash, there had been suggestions that Dana's four aircraft were being overworked. See also: iReport images from Lagos . On Sunday alone, the aircraft with registration number 5N-RAM was already on its fourth trip of the day and scheduled to make another one. In May, the same aircraft had to make two unscheduled air returns following reports of engine failure, according to a Dana Air station manager in Lagos. Whatever the outcome of the investigation, the omens are not good for Dana Air. No Nigerian airline has ever fully recovered from an air disaster. EAS Airlines, Bellview, SoSoLiso and ADC Air were all Nigerian airlines with decent sized fleets and considerable goodwill just ten years ago. Their names all became obsolete pretty quickly following a spate of crashes between 2002 and 2006. The government has taken the step of withdrawing their operational license and ground Dana aircraft whilst an inquiry takes place. Even in the event of continued operations, there would have been a likely slump in passenger bookings which will harm the airline. The investigation must go beyond Dana and extend to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). The main regulator of the country's airline industry will need to face some tough questions as well. Did they do enough to minimize the chance of such a crash? The Dana Air was 22 years old, which is not exactly ancient in aviation terms but given that Nigerian law prohibits aircraft over the age of 20 from operating, who fell asleep at the switch? Besides at that age, any aircraft would require maintenance checks to be as regular as they are vigorous. Separate eyewitness accounts of leaking hydraulics on the MD-83 do not suggest that this was the case. This time around the Nigerian public is in no mood for obfuscation or cover-ups. The last major air incident in Nigeria was in October 2006 when an ADC airlines flight crashed near Abuja and killed 96 on board. The outcome of the subsequent investigation was never revealed but now there is a growing demand that such information is shared with the public. Following that crash, the government grounded all commercial aircraft and revoked the licenses of many. Air worthiness became a paramount issue and as a result the slack operators were forced to tighten up. Those that could not shape up exited the scene. On that occasion it took over 500 deaths in five years to shake the government into action. If laxity has started to creep back into Nigeria's aviation sector, one hopes that it will not take a similar rash of incidents to ensure that safety standards are being consistently met. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Terfa Tilley-Gyado.","Gyado says there were signs that Dana Air standards had slipped in the last six months .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich cut Borussia Dortmund's lead at the top of the Bundesliga to two points with a 2-1 home win over Hanover Saturday. Midfielder Toni Kroos put the in-form home side ahead with a neatly taken goal in the first half. Striker Mario Gomez made it 2-0 on 68 minutes as he beat Hanover keeper Ron-Robert Zieler with a low shot. It was the 23rd goal in 26 league games for the top scorer in the Bundesliga this season. Ivory Coast striker Didier Ya Konan gave Hanover late hope with a spectacular overhead kick six minutes later, but Bayern held on for the three points. Hanover, who face Atletico Madrid in the fist leg of their Europa League quarterfinal Thursday, won praise from Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes. ""You can see why Hanover 96 are in the last eight of the Europa League and the top third of the league table,"" he told AFP. ""They were well organized and not easy to play against. Overall, we deserved the win and I am very satisfied."" Third-placed Borussia Moechengladbach, beaten by Bayern in the German Cup semifinals in midweek, lost further ground in the title race as they lost 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim. It left them six points behind Bayern and eight behind Dortmund. Marco Reus put them ahead in the first half, but Roberto Firmino leveled for the visitors on 77 minutes. But he earned a second yellow card for removing his shot before Boris Vukcevic earned the 10-men an unlikely win soon afterwards. In other matches, Kaiserslautern lost 2-0 at Freiburg to remain rock bottom while Hertha Berlin stayed second bottom despite their 3-1 win at Mainz. In Italy's Serie A, AC Milan extended their lead to seven points with a 2-1 win over AS Roma in the San Siro Saturday. Second-placed Juventus face a tough match against Inter in Turin Sunday as they look to close the gap. Pablo Osvaldo put Roma ahead in the first half, but Milan were always in command and two goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic gave them victory. Swedish star Ibrahimovic has 22 goals in Serie A this season and the win is a welcome boost for Milan ahead of their Champions League clash with Barcelona Wednesday.","Bayern Munich beat Hanover 2-1 in German Bundesliga .

"(CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot returns to a Peruvian courtroom on Wednesday, five days after requesting more time to ""reflect"" on what plea he will make in his murder trial. The 24-year-old Dutch national indicated on Friday that he was willing to make a ""confession"" in the 2010 killing of Stephany Flores, but that he did ""not agree with the aggravating factors"" as defined in the murder charge levied against him. Given this statement, the panel of three judges decided to give van der Sloot until Wednesday to make a final decision. There is no jury. This was the latest twist in a case that has made international headlines, in part because of the circumstances of the killing but also because van der Sloot was arrested twice, but never charged, in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway. Police say van der Sloot killed Flores in his Lima hotel room in May 2010, then took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. Van der Sloot sues nation of Chile . Hours before Friday's court proceedings, his attorney said that van der Sloot would plead guilty to all charges related to Flores' death. His apparent aim would have been to get a reduced sentence after making a ""sincere confession."" But after the session began, he voiced doubt about the charge, leading to the delay. On Wednesday, van der Sloot is expected to finally give his plea in the Lima courtroom. He is charged with ""qualified murder"" and simple robbery in the killing of 21-year-old Flores. If it is not guilty, then the trial will resume before the all-female judicial panel. If he pleads guilty, the sentencing phase would begin. On Friday, prosecutors went over all the evidence and witnesses they had and gave a summation of the case against van der Sloot. The case of Holloway, who vanished in 2005 while on a graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba, is part of the Peru case as well. Holloway was last seen leaving a nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men. Van der Sloot was arrested twice but never charged in Holloway's disappearance, which is still unsolved. His attorney, Luis Jimenez Navarro, pointed out last week that the fatal attack on Flores occurred exactly five years after the Alabama teenager went missing. It has been widely reported that van der Sloot killed the woman after he believed she saw something on the Internet relating to Holloway. ""He is a young man ... who has practically lived persecuted for a crime he says he did not commit ... or for a disappearance that he cannot explain,"" the lawyer said. ""Movies and books have been made ... At that age, and with other characteristics of his psychological profile, ... in that moment, he felt threatened and reacted in a brutal manner."" The victim's family, including her father, Ricardo Flores, had pushed for stiffer charges and said that van der Sloot hasn't looked ""remorseful"" in court appearances. ""He had an indifferent and prideful attitude. He looks as if he has everything under control. He looks better than when he appeared on TV after he was arrested,"" Ricardo Flores told CNN last year. If found guilty on all counts, van der Sloot could face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. Besides the Flores murder trial, van der Sloot also faces possible extradition to the United States. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth. He was allegedly given a total of $25,000, and authorities believe he used that money to travel to Peru and participate in a poker tournament, where he met Flores. InSession's Jean Casarez and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","Joran van der Sloot is charged with murdering a woman in a Lima hotel room .

"(CNN) -- The chief of South Korea's biggest Buddhist order says he will hand over a temple's financial management to experts after monks were caught gambling illegally. Ja Seung said Thursday that the Jogye Order will ""focus on asceticism and missionary work."" Footage from a hidden camera, showing monks gambling, smoking and drinking last month, sparked nationwide criticism. It is not known who shot the video. The monks spent 13 hours taking part in the high-stakes gambling, according to local media. The Jogye Order refused to comment on the details, saying that all information has been handed over for investigation by the country's prosecutor's office. ""Now the society has reached the stage in which monks cannot both focus on asceticism and management. ... The lack of systematic expertise in managing the temple has caused side effects -- factional fighting and conflicts -- for decades,"" Seung said in an official news release.

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid restored their six-point lead at the top of Spain's La Liga with a 5-1 thrashing of Real Sociedad Saturday. Real were held 1-1 at Villarreal in midweek but in their own Santiago Bernabeu stadium were back to winning ways. Gonzalo Higuain put Los Blancos ahead early in the first half before two goals apiece from Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema completed the rout. Ronaldo's double left him level with Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi on 35 league goals as the superstar pair match each other goal for goal to maintain their incredible scoring rates. Xavi Prieto was on target late on for the well beaten visitors. Barcelona had earlier briefly cut Real's lead to just three points after Messi and Gerard Pique scored in a 2-0 win at Mallorca. The victory came despite the reigning champions having to play the last half hour with only 10 men after Thiago Alcantara was shown red. Messi, who became Barcelona's all-time leading scorer in midweek, got on the scoresheet in the first half. Alexis Sanchez was originally credited with the goal from Messi's free kick but it was discovered he did not get a touch. Thiago's dismissal for a second yellow left Barca on the back foot, but when Messi's late shot hit the post, central defender Pique was the first to react to grab the clinching second.","Real Madrid keep six-point lead with 5-1win over Real Sociedad .

"(CNN) -- Bolton's first match since the on-pitch collapse of their midfielder Fabrice Muamba last weekend ended with an emotional 2-1 victory over local rivals Blackburn Saturday. Muamba is recovering in a London hospital after the horrific scenes at Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup tie at White Hart Lane while his teammates did him proud with a battling victory. A pair of David Wheater goals in the first half set them on their way to three points which lifted them out of the relegation zone. But Steven N'Zonzi pulled one back in the second half and Bolton had to survive some nervous moments before sealing victory. At the end they formed a huddle on the pitch, with fans chanting Muamba's name in celebration. Before kickoff, there was a minute's applause for the footballer, who has made a remarkable recovery after his heart stopped for 78 minutes after his collapse last Saturday. Manager Owen Coyle said he was proud of his players after a difficult week. ""In a football context it's a great end to the week to get three points but the perfect end will be for Fabrice to come out of that hospital better with that big smile of his,"" he told Sky Sports. ""Sometimes you are so pumped up to represent Fabrice that it can be a negative energy. ""But once we got the first goal we kicked on. We could have had more goals but we made it nervous, as we always do here. ""Our thoughts are still with him. He's not only a footballer and a colleague to those players in the dressing room but an outstanding young man."" In the late kickoff, Manchester City went back to the top of the table but were held 1-1 at Stoke. They head Manchester United on goal difference, but the reigning champions can open up a three point lead when they host Fulham at Old Trafford Monday. City were heading for defeat until Yaya Toure equalized with a deflected long-range shot. Former England striker Peter Crouch had put Stoke ahead with a superb volley from outside the penalty area. Wolves stayed rooted to the bottom after losing 2-1 at Norwich, but Wigan improved their chances with a 2-1 victory at slumping Liverpool although they stay in the bottom three. Shaun Maloney put Wigan ahead from the penalty spot only for Luis Suarez to equalize early in the second half. The home side, who were heading for their fifth defeat in six matches, looked the more likely to edge it until defender Gary Caldwell became an unlikely match winner for the visitors with a fine strike just after the hour. But QPR's hopes of avoiding the drop took a setback as they lost 3-1 at Sunderland after having Djbril Cisse sent off in the second half. Arsenal cruised past Aston Villa 3-0 with goals from Kieran Gibbs, Theo Walcott and Mikel Arteta to cement third spot. They are three points clear of north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who held Chelsea 0-0 in the early kickoff at Stamford Bridge to maintain their five-point gap over their rivals for a Champions League spot. Tottenham might have secured the three points, with the better chances in a tense affair with Rafael van der Vaart and Emmanuel Adebayor having efforts cleared with the goal gaping. Gareth Bale also rattled the post while Juan Mata's free kick which hit the woodwork was the closest fifth-placed Chelsea came to scoring.","Bolton beat Blackburn 2-1 in their first match since Fabrice Muamba's collapse .

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund edged a step closer to retaining their German Bundesliga title on Sunday as Japan's Shinji Kagawa scored twice in a 6-1 thrashing of Cologne. With nearest rivals Bayern Munich defeating Hanover 2-1 the day before, Dortmund needed a win to restore their five-point advantage at the top of the table. And, after a level first 45 minutes, Dortmund -- led by man-of-the-match Kagawa -- produced a superb second half display with five unanswered goals, to once again hold a dominant lead with just seven matches of the season remaining. Visitors Cologne started strongly and took the lead through a 13th-minute Milivoje Novakovic header. But the home side drew level after 26 minutes when Lukasz Piszczek headed in a corner. Dortmund took the lead for the first time two minutes after the restart when Kagawa blasted home his first and he was also instrumental in some fine play prior to Robert Lewandowski tapping in the third just five minutes later. By now, Kagawa was running riot and his surging run provided Ilkay Gundagon with a simple fourth goal. Kagawa netted his 11th of the season, and Dortmund's fifth of the match, with 10 minutes left and a demoralized Cologne defense could do nothing to prevent Ivan Perisic completing the rout. Dortmund are now on 67 points, five ahead of Bayern who they also face in the German Cup final on May 12 in Berlin. In the day's other German Bundesliga match, Germany striker Cacau scored the only goal as Stuttgart claimed a narrow 1-0 win over Nuremberg. In Italy, Juventus maintained their astonishing unbeaten Serie A record, which now stands at 29, after a 2-0 victory over Inter Milan. Martin Caceres and Alessandro Del Piero scored the second half goals as Juve made it 15 wins and 14 draws this season. But Milan remain four points clear at the top after Saturday's 2-1 success over Roma, with just nine matches of the season remaining. A late Mobido Diakite goal gave Lazio a 1-0 win over Cagliari, a result that puts the Roman side three points clear in third place. Lazio are in 51 points, eight behind Juventus but three ahead of Napoli and Udinese who both drew over the weekend -- in Napoli's case 2-2 at home to improving Catania after squandering a two-goal lead with 15 minutes left to play. Meanwhile, in the only English Premier League match played on Sunday, Newcastle drew level with fifth-placed Chelsea, just five points away from a Champions League place, after an impressive 3-1 victory at West Bromwich Albion. All Newcastle's goals came in a superb first half display, with Papiss Cisse prodding home the opener after just six minutes. And they doubled their lead six minutes after that, Hatem Ben Arfa finding the net after a well worked build-up involving both Cisse and Yohan Cabaye. The result was assured after 34 minutes when Cisse blasted home Ben Arfa's pull-back for his fifth goal since joining Newcastle in the January transfer window. Shane Long pulled a goal back for the home side early in the second half, but Newcastle held on for an impressive victory. In Spain, big-spending Malaga are now level on points with third-placed Valencia after a 2-1 win at Espanyol on Sunday. Two goals in two minutes late in the match from from Ruud Van Nistelrooy and Martin Demichelis ensured Malaga moved three points clear of fifth-placed Levante, who were beaten 2-0 at home by Osasuna. And bottom side Zaragoza continued their good recent form as a last-gasp Apono penalty gave them a 1-0 win over Atletico Madrid. Once cast adrift at the foot of the table, Zaragoza are now level on 25 points with Sporting Gijon and Racing Santander, who both drew 1-1 away from home on Sunday.

"(CNN) -- When I moved back home, I knew what I was in for. My mother tends to nag me. She can't help it. Fussing is in her nature, and her recent battles with fibromyalgia and a spinal injury have not been easy on her nerves. She is uncompromisingly neat, a characteristic that I have not inherited. My room is what she fusses about most. My junk reminds her that my return wasn't something we planned. I graduated from college in 2009. After traveling for a year on a Fulbright scholarship, I came home to my mother without a clear vision of my career path, let alone prospects afoot. According to a recent Pew poll, 39% of 18- to 34-year-olds are living with their parents or have moved back in with their parents temporarily because of the sluggish economy. Sixty-three percent of 18- to 34-year-olds know someone who has moved back home. These numbers don't surprise me. My generation has been called the ""boomerangers,"" meaning that young people like me and my friends are nesting with our folks again when we are expected to be independent. Moving back home has not been easy to swallow. It's more than adjusting to life under the watchful gaze of parents. It's more than feeling anxious about finances. After spending my adolescence stressing out over AP classes and college admissions, then dealing with the rigors of university course work, I doffed my graduation cap only to find that somewhere along the line a good education stopped being the finish line. Facing the job market unsuccessfully has sent me back to the drawing board. We boomerangers have a lot to contemplate. First, we must decide whether to settle for an occupation less than ideal or pursue interests that we genuinely love but may not be as economically rewarding, at least in the short term. My mother's support has enabled me to do the latter. After coming home, I started to intern at a local newspaper and applied to journalism graduate schools. With extra time on my hands, I also began to intern at R&B Records, a nearby music store. The owner, Val Shively, has more than 4 million 45s, spanning the genre from the Orioles to the lesser Jacksons. He and a lone employee, Chuck, are walking encyclopedias of the rhythm and blues tradition. When I'm at the store, I mostly bask in their knowledge, sort picture sleeves and take notes. The experience has placed me knee-deep into a research project on Philadelphia's music history. My friends' stories are similar in some ways. With entry-level positions more difficult to acquire, many boomerangers are forced to look for alternatives. Most of my friends are pursuing internships or graduate study. And still, we wonder: Will this be enough? My cousin Evon juggles two internships at training and development centers along with a third internship at a radio station. He is pursuing a career in publicity, but through his excursion into radio has started to develop a programming portfolio. Arniece, a young woman I went to high school with, took over her family's kitchen last summer in search of the perfect pound cake recipe. She's now planning to get her bakery, Pound of Cake, off the ground. My friend Gabriel searched fruitlessly for a job in advertising before spending two years as a line cook, only to find himself as a visual resources coordinator in the special collections of university libraries. While my friends and I have enjoyed our experiences, the current job market has brought a feeling of uncertainty, which has been unsettling. In 2009, a record number of high school students enrolled in colleges. While it is good news that more Americans are getting a higher education, it also means that competition among young graduates is intensifying. We're left to ponder how to get a leg up. As we vie for the same internships and graduate programs, we expect that our student loan debt will become deeper. Who's to say when we'll be able to afford our starter houses? I can attest that many of my peers are taking time to hone their skills. I've watched them carve out niches for themselves, through internships and sheer will. I would say that my friends are all more enriched individuals. But the uncertainty still lingers. With the changing times, the road to self-reliance and success appears stretched out. Fortunately, the end of my boomerang season is in sight. Come autumn, I'll be enrolled in graduate school. My mother and I are both excited. She's thrilled that she'll finally have my room in order. I'm thrilled that soon I'll get to make a room of my own. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cassie Owens.","Pew poll says 39% of young adults are living with or have moved back with their parents .

"(CNN) -- A state appeals court Friday upheld an involuntary manslaughter conviction against Johannes Mehserle, a former San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer who shot and killed 22-year-old Oscar Grant in Oakland. The appeal questioned some of the evidence and instructions that were given to the jury at Mehserle's 2010 trial. ""We disagree with defendant's contentions and affirm the judgment of conviction,"" wrote the three-judge panel of the First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco. Mehserle was accused of fatally shooting Grant on New Year's Day 2009 on a platform of a Bay Area Rapid Transit station. Mehserle said at the trial that he intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun. He was sentenced to two years in prison for the involuntary manslaughter conviction, but was released last year because of a California law that allowed him to reduce his sentence to nearly a year. This case has been controversial in California's Bay Area community for years. The 2009 shooting was captured on a bystander's cellphone video camera. The video showed Mehserle pulling his gun and fatally shooting Grant in the back as another officer knelt on the unarmed man. The video was widely circulated on the Internet and on news broadcasts, and it spurred several protests in and around Oakland.","Johannes Mehserle was convicted in 2010 of killing an unarmed man .

"(CNN) -- The family of accused killer and kidnapper Adam Mayes, who was placed on the FBI's ""10 Most Wanted"" list, has sent his body to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where students will use it for research and educational purposes, officials said. Charges added for mom in Bain kidnapping . Mayes' body had been with the Mississippi State Medical Examiner's Office since early May, when he killed himself. The body was picked up from there and delivered to the university's forensic department on Thursday, said Mark Golding, medical examiner in Union County, Mississippi. Mayes' body will not be identifiable to students because each body is assigned a number, according to William Bass, a retired professor at the school. Authorities allege that Mayes, 35, killed Jo Ann Bain, 31, and her eldest daughter, 14-year-old Adrienne, on April 27 at their home in Whiteville, Tennessee. He then abducted Bain's younger daughters, 12-year-old Alexandria and 8-year-old Kyliyah, who were missing for two weeks. After being cornered in Mississippi by authorities, Mayes shot himself in the head and died. The girls survived. Both his mother, Mary Frances Mayes, and ex-wife, Teresa Ann Mayes, are accused of helping Mayes. His ex-wife is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of especially aggravating kidnapping. His mother faces charges of especially aggravating kidnapping and conspiracy to commit especially aggravated kidnapping.","Adam Mayes is accused of killing a woman and her daughter .

"ZAM ZAM DISPLACEMENT CAMP, Sudan (CNN)  -- Sudan's Darfur crisis has exploded on many fronts -- violence, hunger, displacement and looting -- but United Nations peacekeepers say the biggest issue now affecting the region is the systematic rape of women and children. UNAMID police officer Ajayi Funmi, left, educates Darfur women about rape. Thousands of women as young as 4 caught in the middle of the struggle between rebel forces and government-backed militias have become victims of rape, they say, with some aid groups claiming that it is being used as a weapon of ethnic cleansing. ""That is one of the biggest issues in Darfur: the rapes, and crimes against women and children,"" said Michael Fryer, police commissioner of UNAMID, the United Nations peacekeeping force deployed to try to tackle the violence. Relief workers say they are powerless to stop the attacks and say that if they do speak out, they fear that the Sudanese government will tell them to leave the country. Humanitarian group Refugees International said in a report last year that rape was ""an integral part of the pattern of violence that the government of Sudan is inflicting upon the targeted ethnic groups in Darfur."" Some relief workers say that almost every woman living in aid camps has been raped or become a victim of gender-based violence. Many teenagers, while out running errands such as collecting firewood, are raped multiple times by militiamen, the workers say.  Watch women face dangers in Darfur » . They say the situation has now become so bad that many women are now resigned to rape as a way of life and men are unwilling to accompany them because they fear that they will be killed if they try to defend them. But despite the extent of the abuse, the Sudanese government insists there is no problem, adding to the difficulties faced by the victims, who are often ostracized by their communities or fall afoul of a legal system seen as favoring their attackers. iReport.com: Share your photos, videos of Darfur . ""There is no rape in Darfur,"" said Mohammad Hassan Awad, a Humanitarian Aid Commissioner for West Darfur, who accuses foreign aid workers of persuading people in refugee camps to make false claims. Although few aid workers dispute the extent of the attacks against women, they say survivors are unwilling to come forward. But those who do reveal shocking levels of abuse. ""She said they removed their scarves and used it to tie them up and were taking turns to rape them. One is 13 years old; the other one is 16 years,"" Ajayi Funmi of the UNAMID police, who is trying to educate women, said after talking to two girls. Making matters worse, aid workers say scores of babies conceived through rape are being dumped by their mothers. ""Abandoned babies are reported, but because of the stigma attached to it, there is no detailed report, because the women don't come forward,"" said Dr Naqib Safi of the U.N. children's body UNICEF. As many as 20 babies a month are being dumped in one camp of 22,000 people. With U.N. officials calling for more female officers to better educate women against rape and women saying they won't feel safe until the under-equipped and undermanned United Nations force is strong enough to protect them, the situation shows little sign of improving.","Women and girls as young as four face rape on daily basis in Darfur .

"(CNN) -- In the three decades since he directed his first feature film, ""The Duellists,"" filmmaker Ridley Scott has crafted a diverse filmography, serving up everything from the classic ""Thelma & Louise"" to the Oscar-winning ""Gladiator."" But it's his seminal 1979 science-fiction/horror film ""Alien"" that will be called to mind this weekend as Scott makes his long-awaited return to the genre with Friday's ""Prometheus."" Although it's sometimes described as a prequel to ""Alien,"" Scott's clarified that ""Prometheus"" isn't really a prequel as much as it shares ""Alien's"" DNA, which in itself is enough to raise audience expectations several notches. Scripted by Dan O'Bannon, ""Alien's"" story focused on the crew of the spacecraft Nostromo, which was returning to Earth when it took a detour to respond to a distress signal. It's a decision that leads to devastating effects, as Scott made sure we understood, ""in space, no one can hear you scream."" Film fans cherish ""Alien"" now as one of a kind, but critical reaction upon its theatrical release was actually pretty mixed. The New York Times called Scott a ""very stylish director"" but added that ""Alien"" wasn't ""the seminal science-fiction film one wants from him."" Time magazine, meanwhile, said the film attempted to ""crossbreed the scare tactics of 'Jaws' with the sci-fi hardware of 'Star Wars,'"" leaving viewers with ""a cinematic bastard, and a pretty mean bastard at that,"" but little in the way of imagination or wit. That ""cinematic bastard"" grew legs as the years went by, and has been ranked by the American Film Institute as one of the 10 best science-fiction films ever made. Part of the success is owed to H.R. Giger's nightmarish alien, which Scott called in a recent Rolling Stone interview ""one of the best all-time monsters."" Without it, he went on, ""I've got a nice, very well-acted, beautifully art-directed movie, but I ain't got that f*****g heart-stopping son of a b***h that defies logic."" (We'd bet audiences would agree.) There's also the grim outlook that Scott employs, which, along with his characters, helps remove any fantasy gloss from the idea of what the future holds. As Wired magazine's Brian Raftery puts it, Scott's sci-fi was ""progressively antiprogress"" in a time when others were offering more optimistic perspectives. So while the ""Alien"" franchise moved on without him, Scott was still rolling the story around in the back of his mind, particularly the question of what happened to the mysterious alien pilot, or ""Space Jockey,"" that was seen in the 1979 film. ""I must have thought about it for three or four years and thought in all of the films nobody had asked a very simple question which was -- who is the big guy in the chair,"" Scott told Empire magazine during a Q&A earlier this year. That turned into four questions, he went on: ""Who are they? Why are they there? Why that cargo and where were they going or had they in fact had a forced landing?"" Seeking answers, Damon Lindelof of ""Lost"" and Jon Spaihts were enlisted to pen the ""Prometheus"" script which takes place in the late 21st century, before the events seen in ""Alien."" With his sci-fi return, Scott's exploring the idea of creator vs. creation as the crew of the Prometheus heads into space seeking the origins of mankind. Noomi Rapace stars as scientist Elizabeth Shaw, who believes ancient cave drawings suggest the ""engineers"" of humans left the drawings as a kind of map to find them. She's joined by her scientist boyfriend Charlie (played by Logan Marshall-Green); the captain of Prometheus, Idris Elba's Janek; Charlize Theron's corporate-minded (and cold-blooded) Meredith, who watches out for the interests of the Weyland Corp.; and Michael Fassbender's creepily cool android, David, who so far has been a critical favorite. Although plot details have been kept close to the vest, ""Prometheus"" holds the promise of a space exploration gone horribly wrong, and reviews have been cautiously laudatory. The Hollywood Reporter acknowledged its technical magnificence while citing a need for more ""adventurous thought,"" while Entertainment Weekly praises Scott's (per usual) command of imagery, but found the movie's ""origin fable ... unwieldy."" Time will likely tell how ""Prometheus"" holds up against Scott's other films, however, and in the meantime, sci-fi fans can take heart -- he's already at work on a ""Blade Runner"" sequel.","Ridley Scott's reputation for capturing a sci-fi story with skill and grandeur precedes him .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Japan has released a slew of economic data that paints a picture of a nation struggling amid the global economic slowdown. Japan's exports plunged 45.7 percent last month, as major exporters made further production cutbacks. The world's second-largest economy reported a drop of 10 percent in industrial output for January, compared with a year ago. The fall in industrial output is a record drop for the country, the government said. Industrial output reflects how much Japanese companies produce. Exporters have cut production sharply as world demand has slumped. Exports plunged an unprecedented 45.7 percent last month, as major exporters such as Toyota and Nissan announced further production cutbacks. Falling global demand for Japan's cars and electronics has led to increased unemployment. The government did report unemployment improved slightly for January, falling to 4.1 percent, versus December's 4.3 percent. But Credit Suisse economist Satoru Ogasawara called that report ""a mystery."" ""I don't understand it,"" Ogasawara said. ""How I see this is that jobless people are simply giving up looking for new work. I'm sure this figure doesn't mean employment is improving."" Economist Richard Jerram at Macquarie Capital Securities also said the unemployment figure is ""not reliable."" He points to the ratio of jobs available to each applicant, which the government says stands at 0.67 for each job seeker. That is the 12th straight monthly decline. That indicates companies are reluctant to hire, offering fewer and fewer jobs to a growing pool of unemployed, Jerram said. Japan also reported household spending fell 5.9 percent in January, compared with a year ago, the steepest fall since the country slid into recession last year. The household spending figure indicates consumers are reluctant to buy, which means companies will see fewer sales and will then have to slash prices and production further.  Watch how the economy is hitting Japan's workers » . The only bright news came in the key consumer inflation rate, which was unchanged in January compared with a year ago.","Japan's economy sees record drop of 10 percent in industrial output for January .

"(EW.com) -- Kim Kardashian's IMDB page experienced a sudden assault of truth grenades earlier today, resulting in an IMDB bio that looked just a little bit...different. ""Kim Kardashian is emblematic of the shallowness of American culture in the first two decades of the new millennium,"" read her official biography. ""While some cultural critics call her the prime avatar of the 'famous for being famous' faux celebrity crowd, she along with Paris Hilton is a new breed of cat whose celebrity comes from the release of a sex tape and the canny exploitation of the resulting publicity."" Too many truth grenades! My nose is bleeding! The IMDB bio continued: ""For Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, the release (accidental or not-so-accidental) of boudoir tapes didn't result in shame but celebration. America, like ancient Rome, seems to have shuffled off the moral coil of virtue of the Republic and is now enjoying its Imperial self in an orgy of ignominy."" The bio then noted various superstars who have derided Kardashian for her faux fame, including Daniel Craig and Jon Hamm, before concluding with a walloping pulpit-imploding rant, noting that Kardashian's fame was kick-started by a sex tape, ""an apt metaphor for socio-economic-cultural malaise in Washington and the country beyond, where everything seems to be run by amoral prostitutes in bed with each other and merely out for a buck."" The bio has disappeared from IMDB, but Uproxx has a screenshot, where it's credited to Jon C. Hopwood, a writer who has crafted over six hundred IMDB biographies. It's unclear if the bio was actually written by Hopwood.

"(Financial Times) -- Angela Merkel said a core group of states needed to press on with European integration to fight the eurozone crisis, a rebuke to David Cameron, UK prime minister, who has called for more short-term crisis measures. Only hours before Mr Cameron's visit to the federal chancellery, Germany's chancellor said nations ""in a currency union have to move closer together"", reinforcing the shift to ""a multi-speed Europe"" which began with the introduction of the single currency. ""We cannot just stop [the process] because one or other doesn't want to join in yet."" Ms Merkel seemed intent on highlighting what Berlin perceives to be a contradiction between the UK's refusal to sign up to strict new EU fiscal rules and Mr Cameron's call for more intervention in the crisis -- a stance which has irritated many in the German capital. With Spain straining to recapitalise its banks and Greek reforms in doubt, Downing Street on Wednesday signalled that Mr Cameron would use his Berlin visit to urge Ms Merkel to take quick steps to pull the eurozone back from the brink of disaster. Her meeting with Mr Cameron in the chancellery -- which included a good-humoured 90-minute discussion with students -- came amid a chorus of calls for the eurozone, and Germany in particular, to do more to quell market turmoil. The UK government has in recent weeks called for near-term measures including a bigger eurozone rescue fund to act as a firewall against financial market contagion, and jointly issued eurozone bonds -- ideas which the German government has repeatedly rejected as unnecessary as it pushes for longer-term fiscal integration. George Osborne, UK chancellor of the exchequer, added to this drum beat on Thursday morning when he said Spanish banks should be given immediate access to the eurozone rescue fund, which can at present only disburse money to governments. Spain's vicious cycle . With Barack Obama, US president, also putting pressure on Ms Merkel to switch tack, the chancellor used her first television interview in weeks to emphasise her commitment to her plan to encourage eurozone governments to cede some fiscal power to Brussels. ""We need more Europe. We don't only need monetary union, we also need a so-called fiscal union,"" she said. ""And most of all we need a political union -- which means we need to gradually cede powers to Europe and give Europe control."" The German government believes only a clear roadmap for eurozone integration will ultimately restore investor confidence. Berlin is expecting Herman van Rompuy, European Council president, to make suggestions about a banking union at the next EU summit at the end of June, with more proposals expected in December. With Spain free to make a request for emergency bank capital from the eurozone rescue fund, and the future of Greece in the hands of voters in mid-June elections, Berlin sees no point in committing to new crisis-fighting tools at the moment. But the difficulties of persuading even like-minded countries to transfer sovereignty to Brussels also became clear on Thursday, when the Netherlands, usually a staunch ally, questioned Ms Merkel's call for some countries to integrate faster than others. Jan Kees de Jager, finance minister, said ""one of the fundamental causes"" of problems in Greece, Italy and Spain was that the single currency had fostered economic divergence, not the promised convergence. ""Within a single European economic and monetary union, I don't think it's possible to have structurally different paths."" The Dutch government is preparing for elections later this year in which parties on the far right and left have strongly rejected tighter European political integration, putting the government on the defensive over any delegation of political power to Brussels. Ms Merkel on Wednesday took a big step towards securing swift parliamentary approval of the new European Stability Mechanism and the fiscal pact, when her Christian Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats agreed outlines for a financial transaction tax, which they hope other eurozone states will adopt. As the fiscal pact requires a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag, Germany's lower house, Ms Merkel had to woo the Social Democrats with a push for an FTT, which her junior coalition partner, the Free Democrats, has long resisted. Both Social Democrats and Free Democrats on Thursday said they backed a proposal by the finance ministry, which suggested using the UK's stamp duty and French plans to introduce a similar tax as ""a basis for a first step at European level"". The move could open the way for ratification of the fiscal pact and ESM by the end of June. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel said a core group of states should press on with eurozone integration to fight the debt crisis .

"New York (CNN) -- Candles used in voodoo sex ceremony caused a fatal five alarm fire after they tipped over and ignited bed sheets in a Brooklyn, New York, apartment, authorities said Friday. The fire left an elderly woman dead and injured 20 firefighters and three Brooklyn residents, according to a New York Fire Department statement. A voodoo priest allegedly placed the candles on the floor around the bed on Saturday after a woman paid him $300 to perform a ceremony with a sexual component, that was meant to bring her good luck, fire department officials said. The candles were accidentally knocked over during the ceremony prompting the man to douse the flames with water and open a window in an effort to clear smoke from the room, the statement said. Forty mile-per-hour wind gusts instead shot the flames back inside the room, it said, creating a ""blowtorch effect"" that whipped through the open window and pushed the fire into the building's fourth floor hallway. ""Time and time again we respond to tragedies that could have been so easily prevented,"" Fire Commissioner Salvatore J. Cassano said in the statement. ""This fire had so many of those elements ... hopefully others will learn from this tragedy."" The occupants fled the apartment, leaving the door open, the statement said. Nearly 200 firefighters from 44 companies took seven hours to bring the fire under control.

"Washington (CNN) -- The FBI has added an alleged murderer and rapist to its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. Fidel Urbina, a 37-year-old former Chicago resident was named to the roster Tuesday. Urbina was arrested in March of 1998 by the Chicago Police Department and charged with kidnapping, raping and brutally beating a woman. Urbina was free on bond and awaiting trial when he allegedly assaulted and bludgeoned to death 22-year Gabriella Torres. According to the FBI, Torres' body was found in the trunk of car that had been set on fire. Urbina, a Mexican national who was working in Chicago as a car mechanic, was charged with that crime as well, but authorities believe he had fled the state of Illinois. A federal arrest warrant was issued for Urbina in July 1999. In August 2006 a provisional arrest warrant also was issued in Mexico in case Urbina had returned to the land of his birth. ""Fidel Urbina is wanted for his alleged role in two brutal attacks directed against innocent women,"" said Robert Grant, Special Agent-in-Charge of the FBI's Chicago Field Office. ""These crimes have demonstrated his violent nature and the need to locate and apprehend Urbina before he can strike again."" FBI officials hope renewed publicity about the fugitive will help, and is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to Urbina's arrest. Officials warn he should be considered armed and dangerous. The FBI describes Urbina as a Hispanic man who is around 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 170 pounds. He has black hair, brown eyes and a severely pockmarked right cheek. According to the FBI, Urbina has used alias names in the past including Lorenzo Maes, Fernando Ramos and Fidel Urbina Aguirre. The FBI says he could be residing in Durango, Mexico, but he also has ties to the Chicago area. Urbina is the 497th person to be named to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list since it was begun in 1950. He takes the spot briefly filled by Adam Christopher Mayes, who was wanted for the murder of a Tennessee woman and her daughter in late April and the kidnapping of the woman's two other children.

"(CNN) -- America, meet Timothy Bradley. Apparently you aren't very familiar with his work. He's a professional boxer, pretty good one, too. He's won three world championships. But he's not particularly loud and boastful. Nor does he carry a big punch. Nor is he an imposing physical presence, standing just 5-foot-6. He just wins. Saturday night, at the MGM Grand, in front of a pay-per-view audience, he gets to show Americans what they have been missing. A career that started when a rambunctious 10-year-old found his way to the gym in Palm Springs, California, culminates in a 12-round test against one of the two best fighters in the world. Bradley, with 28 wins and no losses (one no contest), gets his chance of a lifetime against Manny Pacquiao, whom we're pretty sure you have heard of. Casual fans, on the whole, think Bradley has no chance. Boxing analysts will say he can win -- if -- but you get a sense they don't think he has much of a chance either. Sports Illiustrated's Bryan Armen Graham predicts a knockout. Pacquiao on boxing and politics . ""There's a lot of pressure riding on this,"" Bradley said by phone while on his team bus a week ago. ""By winning this fight, this changes our lives forever. We'll be able to put some money in our pockets, and by winning a huge fight like this we can secure our futures."" Bradley will get at least $5 million (plus money from the pay-per-view sales), by far the biggest payday of his career. He promises he will put the money away, so when he retires, he, his wife and three children will have plenty and he won't ever have to come back to the fight game. If you ask anyone outside the Bradley camp why he could win, they don't necessarily point to one thing he does particularly well in the ring. It's his will. ""Tim Bradley, in almost every respect is a B-plus fighter but he has A-plus determination that makes him special,"" said Max Kellerman, a CNN contributor and an analyst for HBO, which like CNN is owned by Time Warner. Bradley said he cannot be outworked. He means in the ring -- and out. On Kellerman's show ""Face-Off,"" Bradley's trainer and Pacquiao's sparred over who works harder in the gym. ""I don't think there's anybody that trains harder than this guy,"" Joel Diaz said. ""Manny will train harder than him and that's why we'll win,"" Freddie Roach retorted. ""I don't think so,"" Diaz answered, a bemused smile crossing his face. ""They don't know, they don't know,"" Bradley added. ""They don't know where I come from. They don't know my background."" Bradley said his determination comes from life in the tough neighborhood of the North End in Palm Springs. Let's just say there aren't any manicured lawns in that section of town. There was plenty of trouble to be found. Bradley got suspended in second grade for fighting. He got suspended in fourth grade for fighting. He once punched another kid a couple of times for nudging him -- with his wheelchair. When he was 10, the story goes, a friend told him to take his butt to the Palm Springs Boxing Club. Bradley told his dad he wanted to give boxing a shot. Big Ray, as Timothy Bradley Sr. is known, said sure, as long as you listen to your coach -- me -- which sometimes required a good dose of understanding. Once during a workout at the family home, Big Ray, a security officer, wanted to use a medicine ball, but there was none around. ""He goes out into the desert and gets a rock,"" the younger Bradley told HBO, which followed both Bradley and Pacquiao (54-3-2, 38 KOs) as they prepared for the fight. ""He gets a rock! ... He's trying to hit me with a rock on my stomach."" Bradley said his dad pushed him until he would cry, then would tell him ""You think this is hard, wait until you get in that ring."" Kellerman said he talked to the elder Bradley about the difficult training, and Big Ray said his influences were hard-assed football coaches and that was the way he trained his son. Big Ray was also able to use boxing as an enticement to his son, a poor student. The grades and discipline improved when Bradley's parents threatened to hold him out of the ring. Big Ray has been in his son's corner for every fight, through more than 140 amateur battles and his rise through the 140-pound division. As he's fought bigger fights for bigger purses, Bradley has added a few people to his staff, but not many. He likes to keep his team small, preferring family and a few close friends. It's a matter of trust, he said. He just doesn't let many outside people into his circle. It's not like he's an introvert. On the contrary, he's a sociable, friendly guy whom everyone likes. He's definitely not a thug like he was when he was a child. It's a form of protection. ""It's a way to keep the leeches out,"" he said. ""I'm making some money now, and lot of people change."" Lots of strangers come up to him, shove a card in his hand and offer something. Bradley wonders, ""Where were you 10 years ago, eight years ago when I was struggling?"" Where were they before he left to fight Junior Witter in 2008, when he boarded the plane to England with just $11 in the bank, knowing he couldn't lose. If he did, he wouldn't be able to afford to be a full-time fighter. When you watch videos of the two boxers doing their running, the stark difference in the entourages hits you like a Pacquiao straight left. What seem like a dozens people or more follow the Filipino legend, while Bradley jogs alone or with a brother-in-law. But unlike training runs of the past, Bradley spends a lot more time waving to folks in the neighborhood. His celebrity has taken off since he signed to fight Pacquiao. Everywhere he goes he stops for pictures, signs autographs, takes a little time to talk to his supporters. The big-money fight has also afforded him the opportunity to add some specialists to his staff. Bradley, who commits to a vegan diet during training camp, has hired a chef from his favorite restaurant to come to Las Vegas so he won't have to eat in the hotel restaurants and fret that he might eat the wrong thing. He has a new massage therapist, who is the wife of his strength coach. Gotta keep it in the ""family,"" he reminded. ""You don't want just anybody laying hands on you,"" he said. There is no doubt that Pacquiao will lay his hands on Bradley plenty on Saturday. Kellerman said Pacquiao's best chance for a knockout will come early. If it goes past five rounds, well, ""That'll be a dogfight."" Finding the next Manny Pacquiao . Bradley hasn't seemed overwhelmed by increased media attention, the increased fan adoration, the increased pressure from getting in with the mighty Pacquiao. ""Once I set foot in that ring it doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter what you've done,"" he said. He echoed earlier comments that his preparation for this fight, essentially the past 18 years, will ensure a legendary victory. ""I don't care if he climbed Mount Everest. I don't care if he's walking on water. This is about me,"" he told reporters last week. ""Every morning I wake up and look at myself in the mirror. If I am at my very best, I will win the fight. I will be victorious. I put in the time, the dedication and the hard work.""","Timothy Bradley has 29 professional fights and no losses .

"(CNN) -- A South Carolina woman battling a rare flesh-eating bacteria infection has been upgraded to fair condition and is tentatively scheduled for skin-grafting surgery, her family said Thursday. Lana Kuykendall has been in Greenville Memorial Hospital since she was admitted on May 11, four days after giving birth to twins, Ian and Abigail, in Atlanta. ""She has improved tremendously over the last week,"" said her husband, Darren Kuykendall. ""Although she is still in ICU, we believe she is on the road to recovery."" WYFF: New mom with flesh-eating bacteria sees twins . The constant IV drips of sedative and pain medicine have stopped and she is receiving them only as needed, Kuykendall said. ""She looks more and more like herself."" She has undergone almost 20 surgical procedures to treat and contain the spread of the necrotizing fasciitis, according to a statement from the hospital. Advocate: Story of rare bacterial infection raising awareness . ""The treatment required aggressive surgical intervention, but not amputations,"" the statement said. ""In addition to surgeries, she also underwent extensive hyperbaric oxygen therapy."" The recovery process will be slow, according to the hospital's epidemiologist. However, ""We believe she has turned the corner,"" Dr. Bill Kelly said. Kuykendall has had ""longer periods of alertness and tries to respond to the people in the room and the conversations going on around her"" over the last few days, the statement said. ""She is able to communicate by blinking her eyes, raising her eyebrows, pointing and mouthing words.""

Kuykendall, a paramedic, went to the hospital after noticing a rapidly expanding bruise on her leg, her husband, a firefighter, said last month. She was diagnosed then with necrotizing fasciitis, according the hospital. A number of bacteria, which are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections, can lead to the disease. When it gets into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remains. iReport: Surviving a flesh-eating disease . The disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimated that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise because doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities.

"(CNN) -- GOP candidates Christine O'Donnell, Sharron Angle and Nikki Haley have captured the attention of the country this election season, but they're just a few of the record number of women pursuing office this year. More than 160 women congressional and gubernatorial candidates won their primaries and will be on the ballot next week, leading some observers to dub 2010 the ""Year of the Woman."" This year's record-breaking numbers are encouraging, but deceiving, said Siobhan ""Sam"" Bennett, president of the Women's Campaign Forum. ""We're ranked 90th in the world in the number of women in elected office. We trail behind Cuba and Afghanistan,"" she said, citing data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union on the percentage of women in national parliaments. ""[People] look at Hillary Clinton's run for Congress. She's secretary of state. They look at [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi and say, 'Oh, we got there! We have parity,' "" Bennett said. ""Nothing could be further from the truth."" Bennett worries that for the first time in more than 30 years, we'll see a backslide in the percentage of women in Congress, particularly among Democrats. Democrats are expected to lose seats in the House and Senate, and the female lawmakers in office are overwhelmingly Democratic. There are 13 Democratic women in the Senate, compared to just four Republican women. In the House, there are 56 women who are Democrats and 17 who are Republicans. ""The deeper problem underneath all this is we do not have a pipeline or a bench of women prepared to step up and run for the inevitable number of women that we are going to lose this cycle,"" added Bennett, who was the Democratic nominee for Pennsylvania's 15th District in 2008. ""She Should Run,"" a program run by the Women's Campaign Forum, is an effort to recruit and equip women candidates. The program also encourages women to ask other women to consider making a bid for office. iReport: Maria Shriver shares her thoughts on women in politics . In a potential blow to the current crop of female candidates, women voters aren't as pumped about heading to the polls this year, according to national surveys. ""We haven't seen this in the past, but this year it does look like women are less enthusiastic about voting than men are,"" said CNN polling director Keating Holland. In a commentary for CNN.com, Susan Wefald and Sara K. Gould, both with Ms. Foundation for Women, pointed to a number of factors leading to lower levels of excitement: . Women feel overburdened by the state of the economy, turned off by the current state of American political affairs. ""The rhetoric of this political season may not be what we want or like, but times are simply too tough for millions of women to sit this one out,"" they wrote. Jennifer Lawless, a former congressional candidate and current director of the Women & Politics Institute at American University, says it is not specifically women who are low on enthusiasm this year. ""Women are disproportionately registered as Democrats. So it's not necessarily that women are less excited and less interested -- it's that Democrats are, and that indirectly means women are,"" she said. Based on her experience campaigning for the midterms, Sue Lynch, president of the National Federation of Republican Women, said she thinks interest among Republican women is higher than ever. ""The enthusiasm that I'm seeing as I travel across the United States has just been overwhelming,"" she said. ""The enthusiasm I think is at its peak. I don't know that I've ever seen in the past 12 years at the national level such a camaraderie for our women in moving forward and running as candidates."" The female candidates, she added, are bringing a new tone to the Republican Party. ""My adrenaline is pumping,"" Lynch said. ""It is the year of the Republican woman. I pray to God that on November 3 I'm right."" Lawless, who is less optimistic about Election Day, says she expects at best, women will hold steady at 17 seats in the Senate and lose four to six seats in the House. ""All of the pieces were in play for an anti-establishment, anti-Democratic, anti-incumbency year, and we've seen that happen,"" she said. ""Republican women running this cycle have an opportunity to represent that which is not currently in power -- which tend to be Democratic establishment candidates."" 1992 -- the previous ""Year of the Woman"" -- was really the year of the Democratic woman, because that was who represented the anti-establishment candidate at the time, Lawless said. ""It's shaping up to look like the year of the Republican. And it turns out that in some of the most high-profile races, the Republicans actually have women running.""","A record number of women run for office, but experts fear women will actually lose seats .

"(CNN) -- As fears rise around emergence of a ""two-speed"" eurozone, the head of Italian clothing giant Benetton says the region's southern economies should not be discounted. The eurozone's debt crisis has exacerbated a split between the strong economies, led by Germany, and those which are struggling, such as Italy. However Alessandro Benetton, deputy executive chairman of the retailer -- which has 6,400 stores across 120 countries -- told CNN: ""Germany needs Europe just as much as Europe needs Germany."" While Benetton acknowledges southern Europe is not producing as much as its northern counterparts, he said they should not be ignored. ""If Germany thinks it can do it by itself without Europe, I think it's wrong because in a global market the critical mass is important,"" he said. Political tensions between Germany and countries such as Italy, and Greece, which triggered the crisis, have intensified as the crisis continues to roll on. But Benetton said countries including his homeland still have a role to play in the eurozone. ""Rather than throwing them out of the boat, I think you should encourage them to behave better,"" he said. Benetton is talking from experience -- the former investment banker was brought into the family business when the clothing chain was being challenged by cheaper, fast-fashion brands. The brand also faced down controversy last year with its ""unhate"" campaign featuring international leaders kissing each other. The campaign was cut after doctored images of the pope kissing a male Muslim cleric which were labeled by some as offensive. Controversies aside, the company remains a family business with Benetton's father, Luciano, chairman of the group. And it is this family structure which remains the backbone of Italian business, with 90% of the country's economy based on SMEs. Benetton acknowledges there are problems associated with that. ""If the cost of the money is too high for the bank, it will not be accessible to small entrepreneurs and that can be very dangerous,"" he said. Benetton said Italy's major problems are its aging population and high youth unemployment, rather than its ability to repay debt. ""It's not whether we will be able to pay, a company that grows with a business model that is successful always pays it debts,"" he said. ""It is just a matter of time.""","The head of Benetton says Europe's southern economies should not be discounted .

"Washington (CNN) -- In what have become known as the ""Jesus pencil"" and ""candy cane"" cases, the Supreme Court refused Monday to consider appeals from the families of elementary school students over distribution of religious-themed gifts on campus. At issue was whether school officials can be sued for violating the First Amendment rights of what the students claimed was their ""private, non-curricular speech based solely upon its religious viewpoint."" A federal appeals court had ruled in favor of school officials in Plano, Texas,on the liability question, and the justices without comment let that decision stand. The full 16-judge panel from the New Orleans-based court last September concluded while the constitutional rights of the students were violated, school administrators could not be sued under the ""qualified immunity"" legal standard. The litigation continues on other aspects of two separate incidents nine years ago, both involving schools at the Plano Independent School District in the Dallas suburb. ""Educators should not suffer personal monetary liability for making a mistake in this area of the law,"" said the appeals judges. In one instance, the principal of Thomas Elementary School blocked then-third-grader Jonathan Morgan from handing out ""goody bags"" at a winter party. The bags included a decorative pen in the shape of a candy cane with a Christian message that read in part: ""Every time you see a candy cane, remember the message of the candy maker: Jesus is the Christ!"" Parents had met with Principal Lynn Swanson, who offered a compromise: the laminated ""Legend of the Candy Cane"" pens would not be allowed at the classroom party, but could be distributed separately at a table in the school library. School district officials later clarified, saying students in general were not allowed to pass out ""any written material, tapes, or other media"" to classmates, whatever the message. The boy's mother and father nevertheless brought the pens to the party, and the principal then announced to the school by loudspeaker that all ""outside materials"" were banned from classroom distribution. The family claims Jonathan was the only student subsequently banned from distributing his ""goody bags."" A month later at Rasor Elementary School, the parents of then-second-grader Stephanie Versher complained the girl was forbidden from handing out tickets to a passion play, which was being performed at a local church, depicting the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The student expressed her ""sincere"" religious conviction she ""should share her beliefs with her friends."" Days later, Stephanie was then stopped from distributing brownies at a party with two pencils attached, one of which was inscribed, ""Jesus loves me this I know from the Bible."" The other pencil had the word ""Moon"" on it. Her mother then angrily confronted school officials, including Principal Jackie Bomchill. Sherrie Versher later testified she left the school offices emotionally upset, and ""she thought out loud to herself, 'Satan is in the building,'"" according to the court transcript. It was unclear to whom she was referring. A disagreement developed over whether the school had given permission for the student to give the ""Jesus"" pencils after classes that day, outside the school building on the sidewalk. A legal question developed whether that distribution was on school property or nearby, and whether authorities would then have power to stop the pencils from being given away. The appeals court noted the difficulty government officials have ensuring schools and other public facilities remain free of religious proselytizing. ""When educators encounter student religious speech in schools, they must balance broad constitutional imperatives from three areas of First Amendment jurisprudence: the Supreme Court's school-speech precedents, the general prohibition on viewpoint discrimination, and the murky waters of the Establishment Clause."" said the judges. ""They must maintain the delicate constitutional balance between students' free-speech rights and the Establishment Clause imperative to avoid endorsing religion."" The court concluded the principals were entitled to qualified immunity ""because clearly established law did not put the constitutionality of their actions beyond debate."" School officials had said they are entrusted by parents with the education of children, and retain complete control over all aspects of a student's time and communications -- including parties and hallway discussions. The Constitution's First Amendment bars any government from passing laws ""respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" The high court in the past has typically dealt with such church-state disputes by allowing Ten Commandment displays in public buildings; the mention of ""God"" on currency and in the Pledge of Allegiance; manger and menorah displays in public parks; and school and legislature prayer. A Texas-based legal group had represented the Versher and Morgan families in their appeals. ""We are disappointed the Supreme Court denied review of this case,"" said Hiram Sasser, director of litigation of Liberty Institute. ""We were hoping to finally put this issue to rest: that government school officials should be held accountable when they violate the law and students' First Amendment rights. No student should be subjected to religious discrimination by the government."" While the students' ""speech"" in these cases involved a religious message, the high court has also established important precedent on the larger free speech issue. In the famous ""Tinker"" case from 1969, the Supreme Court ruled two Iowa high school students could continue wearing anti-Vietnam War armbands. The high court said students do not ""shed their constitutional rights when they enter the schoolhouse door."" But school administrators do retain the authority to restrict any activity that would cause a ""substantial disruption"" of the school's educational mission. The current cases are Morgan v. Swanson (11-804), and Swanson v. Morgan (11-941).","Texas school officials stopped distribution by students of religious-themed gifts on campus .

"(CNN) -- Voters in Algeria went to the polls Thursday to choose members of parliament. About 25,000 candidates from 44 political parties are competing for 462 seats in the National People's Assembly. Roughly 15 percent of voters turned out, according to the Algerian Press Service. About 500 international observers were on hand to monitor the voting in Algeria, a North African nation of 37 million plagued by high unemployment. The observers were from the European Union, African Union, Arab League and other organizations. Algeria was the site of some Arab Spring protests, but they were not as large as in other countries in North Africa and the Middle East. After those protests, in February 2011, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's government declared an end to a nearly two-decade state of emergency, lifting restrictions on speech and assembly imposed to combat an Islamist insurgency. The emergency declaration was part of a clampdown on Islamist movements during a civil war that left more than 150,000 dead. But critics said the insurgency had long since diminished, and the law remained solely to muzzle critics of the government. Journalist Said Ben Ali contributed to this report .","Turnout was about 15 percent .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's deportation of 14 members of Osama bin Laden's family to Saudi Arabia occurred just one week shy of the first anniversary of his death at the hands of U.S. commandos. Among those being deported were bin Laden's three widows and two daughters, said Aamir Khalil, a family attorney. It was not clear late Thursday whether their plane had departed Islamabad. Earlier this month, the five women were sentenced to 45 days of house arrest for living in Pakistan illegally. Their detention ended last week. Khalil said the time served began March 3, when the five were formally taken into custody. ""The family was kept safe and sound in a guest (safe) house,"" according to a Pakistan Interior Ministry statement. ""They have been deported to the country of their choice, Saudi Arabia, today."" Two of the widows are Saudi, while one is Yemeni. The daughters are ages 17 and 21, Khalil said. The widows have been identified by U.S. and Pakistani officials as Amal Ahmed Abdul Fateh, Khairiah Sabar and Siham Sabar. Judge blocks release of bin Laden death photos . Because all five defendants confessed to impersonation, illegal entry into Pakistan and staying illegally in Pakistan, there was no need for a trial, Khalil said recently. He represents four of the five relatives. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs at his Abbottabad compound May 2, 2011. The al Qaeda leader spent years on the run in Pakistan after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, moving from one safe house to another and fathering four children with Fateh, at least one of whom was born in a government hospital, she told Pakistani investigators. No credible threat of attack on anniversary of bin Laden's death . A deposition taken from Fateh gives the clearest picture yet of bin Laden's life while international forces hunted him.

"(CNN) -- The police beating of a California homeless man has spawned a civil lawsuit in which a bar doorman claims he was fired after he cooperated with investigators and claimed his manager made a false report to police about the homeless man's activities. Michael Reeves, who also worked as a security guard, is suing his former employer, the Slidebar Rock-N-Roll Kitchen in Fullerton, California, for more than $4 million, according to the lawsuit. Eric Dubin, attorney for Slidebar and its owner Jeremy Popoff, said Reeves' claims are ""completely false and fabricated."" Reeves ""was simply fired for getting confrontational with a manager after he let girls in a side door,"" Dubin said in an e-mail to CNN. ""He never mentioned any of these alleged claims to (the) DA when interviewed, during his sworn employment hearings for unemployment, nor in his signed termination papers last year."" Popoff, who's also a guitarist and singer in the rock band Lit, is about to release an album, and the ""bogus"" lawsuit was timed to that release, Dubin charged. ""We will fight this with everything we have,"" Dubin said. According to the suit, Reeves' manager called police on July 5, 2011, to falsely report that ""Kelly Thomas is in the parking lot breaking into cars."" Councilmen face recall over alleged beating death in California . Thomas, 37, a homeless man with schizophrenia, was severely beaten by Fullerton police and he later died in the hospital. In connection with his death, Officer Manuel Ramos, 37, is charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli, 39, is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. They have pleaded not guilty. On Wednesday, Reeves issued a statement in which he stated that ""a Slidebar manager called Fullerton Police and I heard her report that Kelly Thomas was in the parking lot breaking into cars. ""I knew her report to be false. I complained about that false report that night to my manager and continued to complain about the false report until the date I was terminated, on September 23, 2011,"" said Reeves, who was hired in March 2010. Reeves said in the lawsuit that Thomas wasn't breaking into cars but rather was in a parking lot picking up cigarette butts. Reeves refused to adopt his employer's ""false mantra that 'Slidebar had nothing to do with Kelly Thomas' death,' "" said the lawsuit, filed last week. When managers realized ""that they, too, could face legal consequences for their involvement, not to mention the harm it would cause to Slidebar's and (its owners') images, they decided to terminate Mr. Reeves to keep him and law enforcement investigators as far away from Slidebar as possible,"" the lawsuit said. Reeves was terminated two days after prosecutors announced they were pursuing criminal charges against Fullerton police officers, the lawsuit said. According to a review of the Thomas incident by an independent consultant hired by the Fullerton City Council, police received a call from a woman who referred to Thomas as ""Kelly"" and said he was ""roaming the parking lot,"" ""looking in cars,"" ""pulling on handles,"" and ""pacing through the cars and between each car,"" the consultant's report said. The Orange County District Attorney's office wasn't commenting Wednesday on the civil suit's accusation of a false police report, a spokeswoman said. ""Just in general, we don't comment on investigations,"" chief of staff Susan Kang Schroeder of the district attorney's office told CNN. The Slidebar website says the independently owned and operated establishment offers food, drinks and live music. ""We pride ourselves in offering a cool environment, free from idiots. So don't act like one, or you will be asked to leave -- very politely of course. Have fun, rock on, be yourself ... just be cool,"" the website says.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to tablet computers, size matters -- a lot. But these devices are definitely not one-size-fits-all. And like Alice in Wonderland, the ""right size"" for tablets keeps shifting. That's making the tablet market curiouser and curiouser. Many iPad users treasure the Apple gadget's approximately 10x7-inch expanse, and I've seen some bristle at the suggestion that this size might be unwieldy. Meanwhile, users of the Kindle Fire or Nook Color often prize having a tablet that slips easily into a pocket or purse for half the price (or less) of an iPad. There is a large and fast-growing consumer demand for tablets across a wide range of sizes and price points. In February, analysts at iSuppli estimated that 3.9 million Kindle Fire units were sold in the last quarter of 2011. That's only about a quarter of the number of iPads estimated as being sold during that same quarter, but it's still pretty respectable for a new device. The diversifying tablet market also includes the oddball Samsung Galaxy Note -- a moderately pricey, stylus-bearing smartphone/tablet hybrid. Initially greeted with skepticism, this device ended up selling five million units in its first six months. And soon it might come with Ice Cream Sandwich pre-installed. Could the iPad shrink? Rumors have long been swirling that Apple might be preparing to launch an ""iPad mini"" model that's closer in size to the Kindle Fire. CNET Asia reported this last week: ""According to Japanese Apple news site Macotakara, Apple's working with LCD suppliers to get a 5-inch panel with a pixel density high enough to be able to call it a Retina Display. That's according to 'a reliable Chinese source,' the site said. ... That smaller device would arrive sometime next year, Macotakara suggested."" Of course, before we learn the truth of the elusive mythical iPad mini, the next version of the Kindle Fire, which could be released as soon as May or June, might feature a model with a larger screen as well as upgraded specifications. This week, Fire2.net claimed that ""newest reports from Taiwan suggest... that there probably won't be a 10-inch Kindle Fire 2, but two different 8.9-inch tablets and a smaller 7-inch model."" Yes, I know, these are all just rumors, based on information allegedly leaked from Apple's and Amazon's supply chains. But when it comes to upcoming tablet models from highly secretive and competitive electronics giants, that's all we've got to go on. One thing is clear: the Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy Note are runaway market success stories, despite their smaller screens. Perhaps even because they're smaller. Many consumers clearly want and will use smaller tablets -- both cheaper, simpler models and costlier, more fully featured ones. Certainly, Apple has noticed this development even if, as usual, they won't talk about it. So for this reason, I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple eventually launch an iPad mini. Maybe not this year, but perhaps some time in 2013. However, it might not necessarily cost much less. Apple might decide to take the ""small is beautiful"" approach and market an iPad mini as providing extra, or at least different, value -- not as a compromise. That might be totally appropriate, since the perfect size is a matter of preference. As Alice told the Caterpillar: . ""I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,"" said Alice. ""Three inches is such a wretched height to be."" ""It is a very good height indeed!"" said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high)."" The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","With tablets, there is now no ""one-size-fits-all"" answer .

"(CNN) -- Do you know who Fonso was? Or how about Hindoo? Can you tell me what Joe Cotton did? Ben Brush? Judge Himes? George Smith? Paul Jones? I can. Each of them won the Kentucky Derby horse race. (Each of them, by the way, was a horse, not a human being.) OK, now can you tell me what each of them didn't do? I can. Each of them did not go on to win horse racing's Triple Crown. I can also tell you why. Because it is a really hard thing to win, that's why. Animal welfare activists: Horse racing industry needs reform . Bet you don't know Burgoo King. Hahaha, he made Whoppers, I beat you to it. Laughing out loud here. OK, now I will tell you the sweet and sad tale of Burgoo King, and how maybe he could have become one of the most famous racehorses of all time, a Secretariat, a Seabiscuit, a Man O' War. In 1932, when a lot of people were depressed with a capital D, a lot of them were impressed by Burgoo King when he won the Kentucky Derby by three lengths and then the Preakness by a head. He and the 19-year-old boy in his saddle had a nice shot at winning the Triple Crown, which only two other horses (Sir Barton and Gallant Fox) had done. How did he do? Well, he didn't. Burgoo King was a no-go no-show. He skipped the Belmont Stakes entirely. Did not run. He was ""scratched,"" as they say at the track, just as I'll Have Another was turned into I've Had Enough by his keepers on the eve of today's scheduled Belmont race. Overheard on CNN.com: If wishes were horses, 'Another' Secretariat would rise . Would you like to know why? I have no idea. Some horse whisperers spread gossip that Burgoo King's paperwork did not get filled out in time. Others said he must have gotten hurt, but no one confirmed it. All anybody knows for sure is, Burgoo King sizzled, then fizzled. He would not run another race for two full years, and his young jockey was found in Lake Michigan, drowned. Bet you don't know Tim Tam, either. In 1958, when folks were giving thought to buying one of Ford's really cool new cars, the Edsel, a lot of them were impressed by Tim Tam when he took the Kentucky Derby with a tremendous stretch run, then ran first in the Preakness, as well. A few thousand folks laid bets that Tim Tam would do what no horse since the '40s had done: wear the Crown. But, alas, a bone that he fractured during the race caused poor Tim to hobble home in second place. Fame, fortune, immortality ... a kingdom for any 3-year-old horse who could win the big three. Oh, to become another War Admiral, another Whirlaway, another Citation. Bet you don't know Canonero II. He was nothing special, a pretty decent runner in Venezuela, a long shot to say the least when he got into the 1971 Kentucky Derby and sat there in 18th place, going nowhere fast. But then, all of a sudden, here came Canonero II, galloping past them all, winning by nearly four lengths. And after that, why, there he was again, winning the Preakness in a record time. A horse for the ages. That was him. All he needed to do was win that darn Belmont, and maybe he would have, if not for a foot infection that was to blame when he limped home behind Pass Catcher and two others, out of the money in fourth place, then out of sight, then out of mind. Secretariat came along two years later and stole his thunder, not to mention his book and movie deals. I went to the Belmont for the 2004 race. So did a throng of 120,139, the largest crowd in history for a New York sporting event. And why were we all there? To see Smarty Jones. He was going to do it. The first Triple Crown since 1979 and Affirmed was about to be his. Silver Charm was going to do it in 1997, but he ran out of steam in the Belmont at the wire. Funny Cide was going to do it in 2003, but he slogged along in the mud and ran a hard-luck third. News: No shot at Triple Crown as favored colt is scratched from Belmont Stakes . Ah, but sweet little Smarty, he couldn't miss. He was undefeated. He could run in the rain, as he demonstrated at Churchill Downs while taking the Derby by nearly three lengths. He could run Secretariat-style and leave everyone else gagging on his dust, as he showed at the Preakness while winning by more than 11 lengths. A lock, that's what he was. ""I got the horse right here,"" I sang that June 5, 2004, day, doing my ""Guys and Dolls"" bit, slapping a Racing Form against my palm. My old crony Mark Kram, the great Philadelphia sportswriter, was by my side. ""Who else do you like,"" he asked. ""Nobody else,"" I said. ""Come on,"" he cajoled, not liking the favorite's short odds. ""Who else?"" I sized up the tote board, consulted the handicappers, studied my charts, played my hunch. ""Birdstone,"" I said. He was 36-to-1. My poor pal Kram gave me the evil eye. He had a $20 bill that he didn't want to waste. We put down a double sawbuck each. We waited for the trumpet to play, 10 minutes to post time. We observed a minute of silence for President Reagan, who passed away that same day. I said aloud that Birdstone definitely had a shot. I said to myself, ""Smarty Jones could outrun that nag with three legs."" Smarty Jones ran second that day. He was caught in the final few strides by some four-legged history-wrecker called Birdstone. I would see no Triple Crown won that day. Nor would I in 2008, when the 3-to-10 favorite Big Brown was a sure thing, can't miss, easy money. He finished ninth. Dead last. Horse racing. I have had good days. I have had bad days. I'll have another and another. I thought Saturday would be a great day -- an unforgettable day for an unforgettable horse. But you know what? I've forgotten him already. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Downey.","Mike Downey says many horses have won the Kentucky Derby, but not the Triple Crown .

"(CNN) -- Before President Barack Obama's endorsement of same-sex marriage this week, White House officials gave mixed signals on just how and when the president had originally planned to roll out his support for the issue. Some said an announcement had been in the works for a while and was imminent, while others said that the president intended to reveal his beliefs during a previously scheduled appearance on ""The View"" this Monday. Others said the president was going to speak out for same-sex marriage at some point before the Democratic convention. The Democratic sources said that the president knew he had to voice his support before the convention when the Democratic Party is likely to include a pro-same-sex marriage plank in its platform. And whatever timeline he had was moved up after Biden spoke candidly in favor of same-sex marriage during a television interview taped last Friday for NBC's ""Meet the Press."" During the interview, Biden said he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with same-sex marriage, stronger language than the president had used on the matter. White House press advisors were made aware of Biden's comments after the taping and, according to sources in the media, quickly began preemptive damage control, ahead of the interview's broadcast on Sunday. Despite the effort, Biden's comments dominated the political news cycle on Sunday and gained further traction Monday after Education Secretary Arne Duncan said he also supported same-sex marriage in an MSNBC interview that morning. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney was also peppered with questions on the issue during Monday's White House press briefing. A number of marriage equality advocates quickly seized on the comments, using them as a rallying cry to urge the president to take a firmer stance. Many of the groups even pointed to high-profile Republicans who have voiced support, including former Vice President Dick Cheney and former first lady Laura Bush. Some White House insiders told CNN that Obama had not originally intended to announce his thoughts on same-sex marriage on ""The View,"" but some advisers thought it would be the best venue. Others felt that the situation needed to be addressed before then. So on Tuesday ABC's Robin Roberts was invited to come to the White House for an interview, which was conducted on Wednesday. ABC cut into programming around 3 p.m. ET Wednesday, alerting viewers that Obama had officially expressed support for members of the same gender to legally wed. ""I've just concluded that for me, personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,"" Obama said in the interview. The response was instant and dramatic, as Twitter lit up with reactions of celebration and dismay, while political figures flooded reporters' in-boxes with statements. Everyone seemed to have something to say. Supporters hailed the president's decision, with many describing it as a historic moment for the movement. Opponents, however, were quick to disagree with his opinion, though some credited Obama for making his position clear. The White House sent talking points to key supporters and surrogates, emphasizing that this was a personal decision the president came to after discussions with his wife and kids, and later reached out to faith leaders. The president's re-election campaign was already promoting and fundraising off his comments by Thursday morning. Multiple top Democrats said senior Obama aides were deeply annoyed with Biden for forcing the conversation on same-sex marriage earlier than planned. These officials said Biden had, in the past, advised the president against coming out in favor of same-sex marriage because of the potential political downsides, making it all the more frustrating, multiple sources said. All of the sources emphasize, however, the episode will not create a lasting rift between the West Wing and the vice president's office, as Biden has gone off script before and will do it again, they said. In his ""Meet the Press"" interview, Biden mentioned the former NBC comedy ""Will and Grace"" as a major catalyst in what he described as a changing, more accepting American culture. The show's creator, Max Mutchnick, said Wednesday on CBS's ""This Morning"" that Biden had used similar language at a private fundraiser three weeks prior to the interview. He added that the White House was recording Biden while he made the comments at the event. ""This says to me that it was all very choreographed,"" Mutchnick said. ""It just doesn't seem right to me because it was verbatim to what he had said three weeks earlier....He was testing the material out of town, and then he took it to a larger house, which was 'Meet the Press.'"" White House officials told CNN that it's standard practice to record every event the president and vice president attend as a record, whether they're public or private events. Two people who attended the event dispute Mutcnick's characterization and say the vice president gave them no reason to believe the president or the White House was going to reveal a change of position on gay marriage. Late Thursday, two senior administration officials told CNN Biden apologized Wednesday to the president for putting him in a tough position. President Obama responded by saying that he knows the vice president was speaking from the heart. Democratic sources added they were not concerned Biden will ""get credit"" for the president's announcement. They say they think most Americans already believed the president was probably in favor of gay marriage. One source added that Obama has a close personal relationship with Biden, one that trumps his advisers' frustrations. As evidence that the vice president is not in the doghouse -- he has a campaign swing to the critical battleground state of Ohio next week. But, the source said, there is a great deal of interest in keeping the vice president ""on script."" Obama, who once opposed same-sex marriage, had recently taken the official position that his views were ""evolving."" He hinted, however, that he was edging toward embracing same sex marriage, saying at fundraisers there was more work to be done for same-sex couples, leading supporters to believe he would take a clearer position. 1996 document showed Obama favored same-sex marriage . Based on past statements some Obama supporters have believed the president long supported same-sex marriage but kept his beliefs private because of the potential political risks. However, top Obama aides insist the president only completed his ""evolution"" on this issue several months ago. After that, it was just a question of when he'd speak out and share his views. CNN's Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","Timeline to announce was moved up after Biden's ""Meet the Press"" comments, souces said .

"(CNN) -- In yet another attempt to help stop the relentless bloodshed in Syria, a group of U.N. monitors are on the ground to observe a so-called ""cease-fire"" that appears to be violated daily. While opposition activists have reported some improvements thanks to the monitors' presence -- including a brief slowdown of shelling and the ability to retrieve bodies from streets without fear of government sniper attacks -- some say the mission will have little net effect, serving merely as proof that the international community is taking some sort of action. What exactly are the monitors supposed to do? The U.N. Security Council has authorized up to 300 unarmed military observers for a 90-day mission in Syria. The monitors are tasked with observing a cease-fire that was supposed to go into effect April 12, though both the Syrian regime and opposition have reported at least hundreds of killings since then. The cease-fire is part of a six-point peace plan laid out by U.N.-Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan that was accepted by both the Syrian government and opposition members. In addition, observers are tasked with supporting the implementation of Annan's peace plan, which also calls for access for humanitarian groups, the release of arbitrarily arrested detainees and the start of a political dialogue. Who are these monitors? The unarmed military monitors are soldiers trained in peacekeeping duties. They come from at least 11 different countries, including Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Finland, Morocco, Norway, Russia, Switzerland, China, Ghana and Indonesia. The observers are selected based on availability from neighboring missions and recommendations by member states, said Ahmad Fawzi, Annan's spokesman. What restrictions has the Syrian government placed on the monitoring mission? U.N. officials say President Bashar al-Assad's regime has refused at least one U.N. monitor because of his nationality and said it won't accept monitors from ""Friends of Syria"" countries -- precluding observers from many Western countries who have been vocal on the Syrian crisis. The Friends of Syria group, which aims to find a solution to the Syrian crisis, includes more than 60 countries and international bodies, including Turkey, the Arab League, the United States, France and the United Kingdom. In April, the group formally recognized the opposition Syrian National Council as a legitimate representative of the Syrian people. The regime's refusal to allow monitors from such countries isn't surprising, said Asher Kaufman, associate professor at the University of Notre Dame's Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies. ""I understand their point. ... Bashar is concerned with his own survival,"" he said. Al-Assad probably does not want to risk allowing monitors from countries that could be aligned with the opposition. He said the monitors could come from ""impartial"" countries, as ""there are enough members states in the U.N. that are not members of the Friends of Syria coalition."" Fawzi, Annan's spokesman, acknowledged Syria's demand might be a challenge. ""That could be a problem, which we will deal with when it becomes one,"" he said. What other challenges does the mission face? Opposition activists and world leaders have decried reports of retaliation attacks against residents who speak out to the U.N. monitors. ""We have credible reports that when (monitors) leave, exchanges start again, that these people who approach the observers may be approached by security forces or Syrian army and harassed or, even worse, killed,"" Fawzi told the U.N. Security Council. In addition to the fear of speaking freely to the monitors, some say the observers are usually flanked by government forces -- preventing a fully objective, comprehensive view of the crisis. ""If the U.N. monitor mission is accompanied by military, then they're not really monitoring the situation,"" Kaufman said. Can the observer mission bring peace to Syria? Even the head of the monitoring mission, Maj. Gen. Robert Mood of Norway, said no number of monitors can stop the violence without a commitment to peace by all sides of the conflict. ""Ten unarmed observers, 30 unarmed observers, 300 unarmed observers, even 1,000 unarmed observers cannot solve all the problems,"" Mood told reporters after arriving in Syria in April. ""So I call on everyone to help us and cooperate with us in this very challenging task ahead of us."" But Murhaf Jouejati, a Syrian-born scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said the monitoring mission was ""dead on arrival."" ""No one expects the Assad regime to abide by the six-point plan of Mr. Kofi Annan,"" said Jouejati, who is also a member of the opposition Syrian National Council. ""What can I say? It has failed. The Assad regime has failed every principle."" Jouejati said the international community is clinging onto the peace plan to prove it is taking some sort of action, ""to justify the lack of action it should take to save Syrian lives."" Since no diplomatic efforts have successfully stopped the violence, is it time for foreign military intervention? ""I think it was necessary some time ago,"" Jouejati said. ""In the absence of a greater force ... Assad is going to continue to slaughter his people until he wins. He will win when he subdues this uprising, when Syrians will be too fearful to go out and demonstrate for their freedom and their dignity."" But unlike with Libya, NATO has shown no interest in launching a military mission in Syria. There are several possible reasons why the international community would be more hesitant to get involved militarily in Syria. In Libya, rebels had their own capital of sorts -- the opposition stronghold of Benghazi, where they operated out of a large base. But Syrian rebels don't have such a central operations center. In addition, the Syrian army is much stronger and better equipped than the Libyan army. And Syria is considerably more mountainous than Libya, which could make military operations more difficult. Plus there's worry over possible political fallout, Jouejati said. The United States, for example, is in the middle of an election year. ""All seem to be waiting for a U.S. lead ... and as long as the U.S. does not lead, no other countries"" will initiate, Jouejati said. What other options does the international community have to help end the slaughter in Syria? ""If I were a diplomat, I'd be less focused on sending 300 monitors and more focused on reaching a consensus with Russia and China,"" Kaufman, the Notre Dame professor, said. Russia and China are the only members of of the U.N. Security Council that have repeatedly blocked attempts at formally condemning the Syrian regime. Both countries have said they want to focus on a Syrian resolution based on political dialogue, but many analysts say Russia and China have ulterior motives. Syria is one of the largest recipients of Russian military equipment, Jouejati said, and Russia leases a naval facility at the Syrian port of Tartus, giving the Russian navy its only direct access to the Mediterranean. But the interests aren't just financial or geographical. ""Russia and China are both very fearful that the Security Council interferes with internal affairs of states,"" Jouejati said. ""Russia has a problem with Chechnya, and China has a problem with Tibet."" But both Russia and China support the U.N. monitoring mission. And Syria's failure to maintain a cease-fire could cause enough frustration to shift the political landscape. ""If any good news came out of this monitoring mission, it further exposed the Assad regime,"" Jouejati said. ""This may dilute the Russian position. ... I think Russia is beginning to feel the embarrassment that the Syrian regime is causing.""","The U.N. monitoring mission was ""dead on arrival,"" one analyst says .

"(CNN) -- Casey Stoner is comfortable racing in Spain. So much so, the MotoGP world champion used Saturday's qualifying run for the Catalunya Grand Prix as an extended practice session. Nonetheless, the Australian still topped the timesheets and will start Sunday's race from the front of the grid. He heading off championship leader Jorge Lorenzo to claim the 36th pole position of his career in motorcycling's elite division. ""We used the qualifying as an extended practice session as we don't always have enough time to do everything during the 45-minute sessions,"" said Stoner, who won the race last year before also triumphing at Valencia in November and then at Jerez in April. ""This morning we did a lot of work with the hard tire, so in the afternoon in these hot conditions, we worked more with the softer one to get a clearer understanding if we can run with it for race distance. ""We were in and out a lot during the session trying a few different things, hoping to reduce the chatter which is still proving to be a problem. Towards the end of the session we managed to improve it slightly but I think we need to make another step before the race. ""Tomorrow, for sure tire degradation is going to play a role so we're going to have to wait and see, but I'm happy to start from pole."" Last month the 26-year-old announced he will quit the sport at the end of this season, then finished third at the last race in Le Mans. The Honda rider set the fastest time on Saturday of one minute 41.295 seconds -- the equivalent of 334 kmh. Lorenzo, who won in France, clocked 1:41.441 and Spain's 2010 world champion was joined on the front row by another Yamaha rider -- Cal Crutchlow of Britain. Lorenzo's American teammate Ben Spies will lead the second row on Sunday after qualifying fourth ahead of Honda's Dani Pedrosa and Italy's Andrea Dovizisio. Former world champion Nicky Hayden was seventh, while the veteran American's Ducati teammate Valentino Rossi was ninth. Rossi had hinted at a return to the form that won him seven world titles when he finished second in wet conditions at Le Mans, but the Italian was 0.88 seconds off Stoner's pace in the Spanish heat. Veteran American Colin Edwards was 14th on his return to racing after a month out with a broken collarbone. ""It's still a bit tender to touch but when I put my leathers on today I honestly didn't feel it.

"Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (CNN) -- Silence and the odd outburst from accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others turned an arraignment that could have lasted minutes into a 13-hour court session at Guantanamo Bay on Saturday. It was the first appearance in a military courtroom for Mohammed and four others since they were charged last month for their alleged role in the planning and execution of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. The hearing, which wrapped just before 10:30 p.m., offered a rare glimpse of the five men who have not been seen publicly since 2008 when they were first charged by a military tribunal. Mohammed and the others -- Walid Muhammad Salih, Mubarak bin 'Attash, Ramzi Binalshibh, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi -- appeared to work together to defy the judge's instruction, refusing to speak or cooperate with courtroom protocol. The silence from the defendants -- some ignored the judge and others appeared to be reading -- slowed the proceedings to a crawl. Bin 'Attash was wheeled into the courtroom in a restraining chair. It was unclear why he was the only defendant brought into court in that manner, though he was allowed out of restraints after he promised not to disrupt court proceedings. Toward the end of the day, he took off his shirt while his attorney was describing injuries she alleged he sustained while in custody. The judge told bin 'Attash, ""No!"" and warned that he would be removed from the courtroom if he did not follow directions. At one point, bin 'Attash made a paper airplane and placed it on top of a microphone. It was removed after a translator complained about the sound the paper made against the microphone. The judge, Col. James Pohl, needed the five to vocally confirm their desire to be represented by the attorneys who accompanied them to court. Because the defendants refused to cooperate, Pohl ruled the men would continue to be represented by their current military and civilian attorneys. All five men are charged with terrorism, hijacking aircraft, conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury and destruction of property in violation of the law of war. If convicted, they face the death penalty. There were so many allegations behind the charges, it took more than two hours for officers of the court just to read into the record the details of the 9/11 hijackings. Earlier, the refusal of the defendants to speak caused an issue with the court translations. Mohammed's lawyer said that his client ""will decline to communicate with the court."" Because the men wouldn't speak, the judge could not confirm that they could hear the translation of the proceedings. Time elapsed while they set up loudspeakers in the court to carry the translations. Some lawyers objected to this solution, too, and translation remained a problem at the outset of the hearing. Pohl said he would enter a not guilty plea on Mohammed's behalf, if he refused to enter a plea. Later, the five men chose to defer entering a plea, a routine practice during military court proceedings. The next hearing is scheduled for June 12. It will likely be at least a year before the case goes to trial, Pohl said. Hours into Saturday's proceeding, one of the defendants broke his silence with an outburst. Binalshibh shouted in heavily accented English: ""You may not see us anymore,"" he said. ""They are going to kill us."" During recesses, the five men talked amongst each other and appeared relaxed. They passed around a copy of The Economist. Binalshibh appeared to lead the group twice in prayer in the courtroom, once delaying the resumption of the hearing. Mohammed, whose long beard appeared to be dyed red by henna, was much thinner than the last time he was seen publicly in a courtroom. He also appeared much smaller and paler than the man the world came to know through photos released after his capture in March 2003 in Pakistan. The charges allege that the five are ""responsible for the planning and execution of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York, Washington, D.C., and Shanksville, Pa., resulting in the killing of 2,976 people,"" the Defense Department said. The military initially charged Mohammed in 2008, but President Barack Obama stopped the case as part of his effort to close the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, a U.S. naval base in Cuba. Unable to close the center, Obama attempted to move the case to federal court in New York in 2009, only to run into a political firestorm. The plan was dropped after complaints about cost and security. Last April, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the five would face a military trial at Guantanamo Bay. The decision was met with some criticism, including from the American Civil Liberties Union. ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said last month that the administration is making a ""terrible mistake by prosecuting the most important terrorism trials of our time in a second-tier system of justice.""","Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others drag out arraignment for 13 hours .

"(CNN) -- They are public school employees who have been holding down multiple jobs. Now that they've won tens of millions of dollars in a historic lottery, they could stop. But instead, the self-declared ""Three Amigos,"" who share a winning Mega Millions ticket, plan to keep their fortune a secret -- and keep working. ""If it can't be you, these are precisely the people that you would want to see win the lottery,"" said Stephen Martino, director of the Maryland Lottery, announcing Tuesday that the holders of the ticket purchased in Maryland had come forward. Because the state allows winners to remain anonymous, their students and co-workers may never know. Each of the three will get $35 million after taxes, because they chose to take the lump sum rather than annual payments. Three winning tickets were sold nationally in the March 30 drawing, which had a record $656 million pre-tax payout. Besides the Maryland ticket, another winning ticket was sold in Kansas, and the third in Illinois. The Kansas winner came forward last week, but chose to remain anonymous. In Illinois, no winner has come forward, but the ticket holder has a year to do so. The state does not allow winners to remain anonymous. The winners in Maryland are a woman in her 20s, a man in his 40s, and a woman in her 50s, Martino said. They are an elementary school teacher, a special education teacher, and an administrative worker. The night of the drawing, one of the winners went to sleep and had forgotten about the lottery, she said in a statement. ""It was around 11:30 p.m., and my phone just kept ringing and ringing."" It was the two other winners calling to say, ""Get dressed. We're coming over right now."" The three made a plan. They signed copies of the ticket, and one of the winners took the ticket to her mother's house to put in her safe. When they came to claim their portion of the jackpot, all were ""modest"" and ""humbled,"" Martino said. One wants to take a backpacking trip through Europe with her brother; another wants to pay for his daughters' college educations and buy his sister a house; the third wants to tour Italy's wine country, Martino said. All plan to invest money and purchase new homes as well. ""Most importantly,"" one winner said in the statement, ""we're going to be careful with how the money is spent. I watched coverage of the jackpot win on television all week, just so I could listen to the financial advice the professionals were offering."" One of the winners holds two full-time jobs, Martino said. One of the teachers holds two other jobs. In conversations with lottery officials, the teachers indicated no desire to retire, he said. ""They said, 'I can't give up my kids,'"" he said. This was the first time the three had bought lottery tickets together. Each contributed $20 for a total of 60 tickets. One played the lottery frequently; another played just occasionally; the third only played on rare occasions when the jackpot got particularly high, Martino said. When they came to the lottery office, a financial adviser was with them -- and one of the winners carried the ticket in an envelope in her purse, Martino said. ""It's so crazy that even celebrities are tweeting about this,"" one of the winners said in the statement. News reports about another possible winner were not accurate, Martino said. The winning ticket was sold at a 7-Eleven in Milford Mill, the lottery said. The retailer gets $100,000 for selling the winning ticket. CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","NEW: One of the winners had gone to sleep and forgotten about the drawing .

"(CNN) -- Two Kentucky men pleaded not guilty Thursday to kidnapping and assaulting a gay man because of his sexual orientation, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Kentucky. The case marks the first use of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crime Prevention Act of 2009 to bring a case alleging a violation of the sexual orientation provision of the statute. David Jason Jenkins, 37, and Anthony Ray Jenkins, 20, were indicted late Wednesday for allegedly kidnapping and beating Kevin Pennington. The defendants, who are cousins, also are charged with conspiracy. On April 4, 2011, the defendants enlisted the help of two women to lure Pennington into a pickup truck with the Jenkins cousins, according to the indictment. The two men allegedly drove Pennington to Kingdom Come State Park and assaulted him. ""David Jason Jenkins and Anthony Ray Jenkins made a plan to assault Pennington because of his sexual orientation,"" the indictment said. It also said the men wore clothing to try to hide their identities and disabled a light inside the truck to affect Pennington's ability to see who they were. The women allegedly encouraged the defendants as they beat Pennington, but are not charged in the indictment. Andrew Stevens, David Jenkins' lawyer, said he has not seen the government's evidence in the case, but he told CNN he finds the use of the hate crime statute troubling. ""It's hard to say how you get in someone's head and say this has to do with homosexuality,"" Stevens said. ""It's quite a burden for the government to prove, and I have a suspicion we're in for a fist fight."" Stevens said his view of the case is that there was ""an altercation"" about a ""drug deal gone bad."" A lawyer for the other defendant did not immediately return a message seeking a comment. The trial for David Jenkins and Anthony Jenkins is scheduled for June 18. If convicted, the defendants face a maximum of life in prison. Shepherd was a gay teenager who died after being tied to a fence in Wyoming and beaten in 1998. Byrd was an African-American man killed in Texas the same year when he was dragged to death.","David Jason Jenkins and Anthony Ray Jenkins are accused of beating a gay man .

"(CNN) -- He's no longer the No. 1 golfer in the world, but there's no question that the sport of golf still revolves around Tiger Woods. And Woods remains a key player in the video game world, as well. This year marks the 15th anniversary of Electronic Arts' bestselling Tiger Woods PGA TOUR franchise. The new PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 games ship March 27, just before The Masters. Of late, Woods has shown a sense of humor when it comes to promoting Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 13, the first game to incorporate Kinect voice commands and controller-free gameplay into the franchise. In this exclusive interview, Woods talks about his love of video games, how his new game compares to playing the Masters and teaming up with future NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal in the kung fu viral video, ""Duel of the Masters."" What video games did you play growing up? The first video game I played was Pong. It was fun because I grew up on Atari 2600, and that was the game console at the time and it became the 5200 and then I think Nintendo came out with theirs and kind of moved on from there. What are your thoughts on how far games have come since then? Oh, my god. The real awesome game at the time was Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Space Invaders, or games of that nature. And to see the realism that they have now and the facial recognition is just amazing, the body language and the movements. They're so lifelike. How have you seen games advance just during the course of time that you've worked on these Tiger Woods video games? This is my 15th year doing it and to see from the early days before mo-cap (motion-capture), where it was just a swing that they put on, to the mo-cap, to now in the game where there's actual facial movements that we have to do. The swing is identical to ours, and now with the whole Kinect, now we're actually moving our bodies. Now the body is the remote (controller). It's not just our thumbs. I think that's amazing to see how far gaming has come in such a short span of time. As someone who's played games your whole life, what have you learned about game development from working on these games? Well, it's just the man hours. I'm certainly no computer programmer, that's for darn sure, but I understand how complicated it really is. When you're a gamer as a kid, you just play it. You never really understand why. You don't care why. But now being a part of the game and representing EA, it's incredible to see the man hours that it takes and the detail that we have to put into it to make the game better each and every year. How involved are you when it comes to the development of these games each year? Quite a bit, because I try and make suggestions on how we can make the game better, how can we make the game more realistic, how can we make it so that it's what we see, what we play on real golf courses. How they're going to lay out the golf courses within 6 millimeters of Augusta National is quite phenomenal because I have all the greens charted in my books that I use each and every year. And to hit putts at Augusta and then go on to the game and hit the same putt, and I know it breaks three inches, and it breaks three inches in the game is just phenomenal. They're able to create that type of realism. Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 13 introduces voice commands. What's it like for you to actually talk to the Kinect in this game? It's pretty trippy. It really is. You can change clubs and ask for caddy advice ... all these different things that are now a part of it. It's just amazing as to how fast this has all come about in the last few years. What was it like working with Shaq on that new kung fu viral video? Man, he's a big dude. I've seen him around because I used to live in Orlando and he's actually a member of the same club that I used to live at and see him around, but I haven't seen him in a little bit and you just forget how big he is. He's a phenomenal athlete, as we all know. He's probably one of the greatest centers that ever played the game and to have him do the moves that he did for the game at that size is quite remarkable to see. He's so athletic, and what people don't realize about that spot is that he broke a TV on set. He was just messing around, doing all his moves and happened to do a side kick and kicked a monitor, which was an expensive mistake. Did you guys have time during the shoot to play any video games? No, we were basically messing with each other. We were giving each other a quite a bit of grief the entire time and it was fun to catch up. What's your favorite gadget that you can't live without? I've got to say iPhone or iPad. It's just amazing that you can have something that small to be able to do so many different functions and have it user-friendly and that my 3-year-old can pick up my iPhone or iPad and type in my code and go to what game he wants to play and what app he wants to use. It's pretty amazing. How big into technology are you? I wouldn't say I'm completely into it, but I certainly enjoy the laziness of new technology and always have. And with Tiger Woods games expanding to Facebook and to mobile devices do you play those versions? Yeah. Yeah. We run all that. I absolutely run through all those things. When you're not playing Tiger Woods Golf, what video game do you like to play? I usually play first-person shooter games, which is something I enjoy. Is there a particular one that you've played lately that you enjoyed? I enjoyed Medal of Honor quite a bit. Did you check out Medal of Honor: Warfighter yet? Yeah, I saw that (trailer). I'm excited. Are you kidding me? Do you ever go online and play against people in Medal of Honor? Playing online, they cheat. It's no fun. They're professionals, or they just cheat. That's how I look at it. That's my way of making myself feel better. Speaking of professionals, what are your thoughts about the fact that there are actual professional video game players out there today? You know, there really are. I met a guy a number of years ago who played my game for a living and he made 150 grand for a year playing my game. That's interesting because most of the pro gamers play games like Halo, Call of Duty and StarCraft II. Well, we brought in one of these guys from Australia. He had a whole book on certain wins. You have to hit the ball this hard and aim here and it's going to do this on the green, and he had this down to an absolute science. He had this huge notebook, and we brought him in as -- I guess -- a preventative hacker, you can say that. It was phenomenal. Have you checked out the new PS Vita? Yes, but I've never played or used it. So I'm excited about some time doing that. What are the challenges each year of adding new content to the Tiger Woods game franchise? That's the challenge. It's trying to give all the gamers out there something new, something challenging, but also keep it fun at the same time. [We] try and make it as real as we possibly can without losing the fun value in it.","This year marks the 15th Anniversary of EA's ""Tiger Woods PGA TOUR"" franchise .

"(CNN) -- Sunday's parliamentary election in Greece delivered a crushing blow to New Democracy and Pasok, the two dominant parties that have ruled the country for the last 37 years. In the coming weeks, expect uncertainty, shifting alliances and growing frustration as a new political landscape struggles to emerge from the wreckage of the old. As the main backers of Greece's second bailout and the harsh austerity measures that accompanied it, New Democracy and Pasok saw their combined share of votes plunge, as angry voters punished them for two years of wage and pension cuts and rising taxes. Pasok, in particular, which won a landslide election in 2009 and made the fateful decision to seek the financial assistance of euro zone partners and the International Monetary Fund in 2010, saw its support collapse. Coming in second at the polls was Syriza, a left wing party fiercely opposed to privatization, public sector spending cuts and labor market reform. The other four parties that garnered enough parliamentary votes, ranging from the unreconstructed Communists to the pro-Nazi thugs of Golden Dawn, are also opposed to further austerity. What will happen next will depend on the ability of the frontrunners to form a coalition government made up of pro-European forces that will meet the conditions set by Greece's official creditors for the disbursement of further funds. These conditions include the adoption of spending cuts worth 11.5 billion euros for 2013-2014 by next month, as well as quick progress in privatization and the opening up of closed professions, two areas in which neither the former nor current prime minister made any significant headway. Antonis Samaras, head of New Democracy, said initially that his party was willing to lead a coalition government with the aim of keeping Greece in the euro zone and amending the policies of the loan agreement so that they could promote growth. But he has relinquished the mandate to form a government after talks broke down with the leaders of other parties, including Syriza, Pasok and the Democratic Left. Syriza, the real winner in the election, has made it clear that it plans to reject the new loan agreement and come to a new understanding with Greece's euro zone partners. This position makes it hard for it to take part in a national unity government that would include New Democracy or Pasok. At this point, it appears more likely that the parties will fail to form a coalition and Greece will be led down the treacherous path to new elections in June. This would entail a delay in the adoption of a new package of spending cuts, which in turn will mean that the next installment of the loan, due in August and worth up to 29 billion euros, will also be set back. A political stalemate will delay both recapitalization of the Greek banks and repayment of more than 6 billion euros owed by the government to private contractors. The consequence is that Greek businesses, including healthy ones, will be deprived of much-needed oxygen. In a country that is in its fifth consecutive year of recession and with an economy expected to shrink by more than 5% this year, this mess will cause any green shoots of recovery to wilt and die. However, the victory of Francois Hollande in the French presidential election has sent a breeze of hope throughout the euro zone. Many expect, perhaps too optimistically, that France's new leader will convince Angela Merkel of Germany to temper her obsession with austerity in the European economy. It is hoped that she may give her consent to the issuing of euro bonds to promote infrastructure investment, complement the recently agreed fiscal compact with pro-growth measures and perhaps, less realistically, accept a plan to allow the European Central Bank to lend directly to fiscally troubled countries. From Greece's vantage point, these are positive developments. But they will all be for naught unless the Greek political system can form a viable government that will implement the commitments it has undertaken -- properly amended in ways that Greece and its lenders can agree on -- and set the foundations for the transformation of the Greek economy to allow it to benefit from any improvement in Europe's prospects. It is a tall order. And Greek politicians have shown little evidence of their ability to shoulder it. But the future prosperity of Greece, as well as the stability of the European Monetary Union, depends on their success. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yannis Palaiologos and Theodore Pelagidis.","Parliamentary election in Greece delivered a crushing blow to the two dominant political parties .

"Puyallup, Washington (CNN) -- Funeral services for the sons of Josh Powell are scheduled for early Saturday afternoon in Puyallup, Washington, where authorities say Powell set his house on fire, killing all three of them. Services for 7-year-old Charlie and 5-year-old Braden will be held at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Stake Center and will be open to the public, according to Anne Bremner, an attorney for the Cox family. Powell was a suspect in the 2009 disappearance of his wife, Susan Cox-Powell. His two sons died Sunday along with Powell in what police believe was a murder-suicide. A social worker brought the boys to Powell's home for a court-ordered supervised visit, authorities said. But as they approached the door, Powell pushed the social worker back, took the boys inside and locked the door. ""He blew up the house and the kids!"" the social worker shouted in a 911 call released late Tuesday by Ed Troyer, spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff's Department. Powell took the children and slammed the door in her face, she said. ""I thought it was a mistake. I kept knocking and then I called 911."" The powerful blast shook houses, with debris landing on lawns blocks away. Minutes before he wounded his two young sons with a hatchet and set his house ablaze, Powell left a last voicemail to family members. ""I am not able to live without my sons, and I'm not able to go on anymore,"" he said, according to ABC News, which obtained the voice mail. ""I'm sorry to everyone I've hurt. Goodbye."" Investigators found the hatchet they believe was used on the boys in Powell's Graham, Washington, home, said Troyer. Authorities believe Powell set an explosive fire there after wounding the boys Sunday afternoon. Autopsies showed his sons suffered ""chop"" injuries to their necks, but both boys and their father died from inhaling carbon monoxide, the county medical examiner's office said. Before dousing his home with gasoline and setting it ablaze, Powell gave toys and books to charity and sent multiple goodbye e-mails. That evidence suggests that Powell planned the deaths for some time, Troyer said -- ""I believe this was intentional."" It was a gruesome development in a saga that began two years ago in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Valley City, Utah, when 28-year-old Cox-Powell disappeared. Nancy Grace interviews Susan Cox-Powell's sister . The farewell e-mails Powell sent included one to his attorney, saying simply: ""I'm sorry. Goodbye."" He also sent e-mails to his pastor and others just minutes before the fire, giving instructions on how to handle his end-of-life business, according to Troyer. The sheriff's department has copies of some of the e-mails sent to the attorney, family and friends, in which he said ""he couldn't live with what was going on,"" Troyer said. The spokesman added that authorities found two 5-gallon cans of gasoline in the home, one of which appeared to have been lit right next to the bodies, which were found together in the same room. The deaths of Powell and the children could mean Cox-Powell's disappearance might never be solved. Still, the case remains open and investigators vowed to pursue it until the point of closure. Follow a timeline of the case . ""I promised the Coxes I wasn't giving up, and I'm still not because we want to get some closure here,"" West Valley City, Utah, Police Chief Buzz Nielsen said Monday. ""The case is still active; we're not closing the case. We still got things that have not been resolved."" Cox-Powell's sister, Denise Cox, told CNN on Tuesday she had been told by her family that Powell could be arrested within a few weeks and that authorities were attempting to build a case against him despite the lack of a body. ""We were all excited that something was going to happen,"" she said, adding the family was hoping that a deal could be made or Powell could be coerced to divulge his wife's whereabouts. In the meantime, Powell, who had not been arrested or charged, was embroiled in an ugly custody dispute with the Cox family. In recent months, the children had started opening up and talking about what happened the night their mother disappeared, members of the Cox family said. ""They basically kept saying how they went on a vacation in the desert, and camping ... they stopped at some place, and Mommy and Daddy left, and only Daddy came back,"" Judy Cox, Susan Cox-Powell's mother, told NBC's ""Today"" on Tuesday. Chuck Cox, Susan Cox-Powell's father, told ""Today"" that the younger boy, Braden, had drawn a picture of the family's minivan. Asked who was in the minivan, the child told his teachers ""that was his daddy, Charlie and himself, and that Mommy was in the trunk,"" he said. But, Cox told ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" the boys' remarks were inconsistent. ""When I would say, 'Well, Daddy said Mommy stayed home' (from the camping trip), then they would go back to, 'I don't remember,'"" a rehearsed, you know, a coached statement,"" he said. Authorities believe that by setting the fire, Powell not only killed his children -- he eliminated evidence in his wife's disappearance. ""Those boys were evidence. Those boys were going to be evidence against him,"" Troyer said. ""You're looking at somebody who's willing to kill their own kids ... killing your wife isn't that much of a stretch from there."" Asked whether she believes Powell's motive was the custody battle or remarks made by the children, Judy Cox told ""Today"" she felt it was both. ""He was feeling cornered,"" she said. ""... Basically, he didn't like us, and he wanted to get the kids away from us so much,"" she said. ""It really bothered him that the boys were showing such affection to Chuck."" According to investigators, Powell had said the last time he saw his wife was the night he and his sons -- then ages 2 and 4 -- left to go camping after midnight in freezing weather. Cox-Powell's sister eventually reported her missing. A month later, Powell and his children moved from Utah to Washington. The double homicide and suicide on Sunday came days after a judge refused Powell's petition to regain custody of his children. The judge instead ordered Powell undergo psychological evaluations -- an order that came after authorities turned up child pornography in the home Powell shared with his father, Steven Powell. As part of the investigation into Cox-Powell's disappearance, a search of the home was conducted last year. During the search, investigators ""discovered numerous images and recordings of adult and juvenile females,"" according to a statement released by the Pierce County sheriff's department. Steven Powell was subsequently charged with 14 counts of voyeurism and one count of possessing images of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct, according to court documents. He remained jailed and on suicide watch on Tuesday, Troyer said. After the arrest of Powell's father, custody of his sons went to the Coxes, according to Washington state court records. Powell maintained in court documents filed last week that he established his own home after his father's arrest and had ""consistently proven my fitness as a stable and loving parent under close supervision by (child welfare caseworkers)."" The Coxes said they were concerned about Powell's having visitation, but noted that several previous visitations were uneventful. However, they were worried about the first visitation after the court's ruling, Chuck Cox said on ""Today."" ""We knew that if he was cornered and felt like there was no way out, that he was capable of this,"" he said of Powell. The couple had communicated their concerns to police and child welfare workers, he said. ""I understand they have a lot of people and they deal with a lot of people who exaggerate the threat -- cry wolf, if you will,"" he said. But, given the circumstances, ""We felt they should have taken more care."" CNN's Thelma Gutierrez, Ashley Hayes, Tina Burnside, Sara Weisfeldt and HLN's Alexis Weed and Phil Rosenbaum contributed to this report.","NEW: ""He blew up the house and kids!"" shouts the social worker who dropped them off .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Senate committee will expand its probe into the U.S. Secret Service this week following a scandal involving prostitutes in Colombia in advance of a recent trip by the president. The Homeland Security Committee will send the Secret Service ""some questions this week, as the beginning of our broader investigation, asking whether... this was an exception, or is there anything in the records that show this is a pattern of misconduct that has gone on elsewhere by Secret Service agents on assignment, but off-duty?"" Sen. Joe Lieberman, the committee chairman, told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""Why wasn't it noticed if that was the case? What's the Secret Service going to do to make sure it never happens again?"" Some Secret Service members and agents allegedly brought back several prostitutes to a hotel in Cartagena, according to sources familiar with the U.S. government's investigation. The Secret Service says 12 members of the agency have been implicated in the incident. Across the Sunday political talk shows, officials expressed confidence in Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan, saying they believe he has handled the scandal well and will get answers. ""History is full of cases where enemies have compromised"" people with security or intelligence information through sex, said Lieberman, I-Connecticut. He added that based on what he has been told so far, ""there is no evidence that information was compromised"" in this case. Down the road, the committee will hold a public hearing on the matter -- perhaps more than one, Lieberman said. ""Anyone who's found to be guilty"" will lose his job, Rep. Peter King, Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" King told CNN last week that four investigators were assigned to his committee's probe. One person who was ""partially exonerated"" will instead likely face administrative action, King said. In a letter sent to Sullivan on Friday, King listed a series of questions, including how many employees were aware of the alleged incident and how many total employees were in Cartagena in support of President Obama's trip to the Summit of the Americas when the incident occurred earlier this month. ""Please provide a comprehensive, minute-by-minute timeline of all known actions, locations, and possible violations of U.S. or Colombia law,"" codes of conduct, and directives, King wrote in the letter. But King and other officials are quick to emphasize that those allegedly involved in cavorting with prostitutes at a hotel in Cartagena are the exceptions. ""In any organization things can go wrong,"" President Obama's chief campaign strategist David Axelrod told CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""I must say that in my experience the Secret Service has been completely professional, so impressive. I always felt like they were ... willing to do anything to protect the president and the people around the president. And so this was really disappointing. ""Obviously we have to get to the bottom of it, but those problems should not denigrate the efforts of so many who do such a good job."" Sen. Susan Collins, ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee, and Rep. Carolyn Maloney of the House Oversight Committee suggested having more female agents could help avoid such scandals. ""I can't help but wonder if there'd been more women as part of that detail if this ever would have happened,"" Collins told ABC's ""This Week."" Maloney agreed, and added that she was told 11% of agents in the Secret Service are women. The agency did not immediately confirm the figure to CNN Sunday. ""We probably need to diversify the Secret Service and have more minorities and more women,"" she said. Six Secret Service members have left their jobs in the wake of the incident in Cartagena, Colombia, which came while they were on a security detail in advance of President Obama's trip for the Summit of the Americas. One employee ""has been cleared of serious misconduct, but will face administrative action,"" the Secret Service said. Five employees are on administrative leave and have had their security clearances temporarily revoked. In addition, the U.S. military is investigating 11 of its own troops for possible heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes. White House staff have not been implicated in the controversy. After the scandal broke, President Obama called for a ""thorough"" and ""rigorous"" invsetigation. ""If it turns out that some of the allegations that have been made in the press are confirmed, then of course I'll be angry,"" he said.","Senate committee Chairman Lieberman asks whether there's a pattern of misconduct .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- The political arm of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood has announced plans to run one of its leaders in the country's presidential elections in May, reversing an earlier pledge to stay out of the race. The once-banned Islamist movement will be represented by Khairat al-Shater, a longtime financial backer, the Brotherhood announced over the weekend. Al-Shater has resigned from his post as deputy chairman to join the already crowded field of presidential candidates, group said. The jail terms he served under ex-Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak had been an obstacle that would have kept him off the ballot. But the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which took power after the 2011 uprising that toppled Mubarak, pardoned him Sunday, his lawyer, Abdel Moneim Abdel Maqsood, told CNN. The Muslim Brotherhood has pledged repeatedly that it would not field a presidential candidate. But candidates from its political arm, the Freedom and Justice party, won the largest share of seats in Egypt's parliamentary elections in December. And Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie said Saturday the new Egypt ""is under a serious threat"" because its current, military-led government ""has failed to represent the will of the people."" More than 450 people have already registered or announced plans to seek the presidency. Among them are former Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa -- who served as Mubarak's foreign minister -- and Ayman Nour, an opposition leader jailed by Mubarak and recently pardoned as well. The field also includes other Islamist presidential hopefuls, including the ultra-conservative Salafist candidate Hazem Abu Ismael and former Muslim Brotherhood member Abdel Moneim Abou El Fettouh, who broke with the Muslim Brotherhood over what he called its authoritarian style. Al-Shater is a furniture and textile magnate who has led the Brotherhood's business association. Though considered a conservative, he is also credited with being the driving force behind the Brotherhood's affirmation that Egypt should continue to honor its international agreements -- including its peace treaty with Israel. Liberals and secularists who led the uprising against Mubarak fear that a victory in the presidential elections, the first round of which begins May 23, may lead the Brotherhood to impose a fundamentalist Islamic agenda on Egypt. ""Their stance continues to change as they strengthen their political position,"" socialist activist Sherif Maher said. ""They were patient after Mubarak fell and announced that they would not seek more than 20% of the seats in parliament. The number went up to 30, and now they have won more than half of the constituent assembly."" But Rami Shaath, a founding member of the Egyptian Revolutionary Alliance, said al-Shater's entry into the race may be a bid to make an example of Aboul Fettouh, ""who had defected against their will."" ""Aboul Fettouh is championed by the revolutionaries and not favored by the military,"" Shaath said. ""They also want to make a point to the youth of the Brotherhood that abandoning the group may cripple one's ambition."" In March, the Muslim Brotherhood blasted the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces for holding onto power despite the parliamentary elections and questioning whether the generals would try to rig the presidential vote. In a rare and charged public response, the generals hit back against what they called a ""baseless slander"" and an ""unacceptable"" challenge to the legitimacy of elections. Al-Shater is a 61-year-old civil engineer who became a millionaire businessman. He has been involved with Islamist groups since the late 1960s, according to his official biography, and was jailed for five years by a military court during a crackdown on Islamist movements in the mid-1990s. In 2007, he was charged with providing funds and weapons to college students and imprisoned again. He was still behind bars when the regime fell in February 2011, and the military junta that took power from Mubarak released him for medical reasons a month later. Before Sunday's pardon, that record could have disqualified him from the race.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, alienated from the country's supreme leader, suffered setbacks in the country's parliamentary runoff elections Saturday in what could be a sign of things to come in the Islamic republic. Initial results showed candidates allied with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and critical of Ahmadinejad ahead in the polling. Sadegh Zibakalam, a professor of political science at Tehran University, said the election was ""a face-off between pro- and anti-Ahmadinejad conservative factions within the ruling regime."" However, Zibakalam said Ahmadinejad still did well in critical areas like Tehran, though two winning candidates -- Ali Motahari and Ahmad Tavakoli -- are vocal critics of the president. The runoff election was held Friday in 33 constituencies with 130 candidates competing for 65 seats in the 290-member parliament. The first round voting was March 2 in which anti-Ahmadinejad candidates won over 180 seats, giving them a majority in the new parliament, state-run Press TV reported. Over 48 million Iranians were eligible to vote and 64% of them cast ballots in the first round. Ahmadinejad drew the ire of Khamenei loyalists last year when he challenged the supreme leader's authority in appointing top government officials, analysts said. But Zibakalam said he did not think the parliamentary results would make much difference in the remainder of Ahmadinejad's second and last term in office. ""His power began to weaken awhile ago after his showdown with the supreme leader,"" he said. ""What he wanted to do was groom one of his supporters to be his replacement but I don't think he stands a serious chance of influencing the presidential elections next year. ""He tried to consolidate his power when he challenged the supreme leader and his supporters but that was the beginning of his demise,"" Zibakalam said. The election for a new parliament, known as the Majlis, will also have no effect on Iran's foreign policy or its position on nuclear program. Those decisions have been and will continue to be made by Khamenei. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report .","Initial results showed critics of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad doing well .

"London (CNN) -- James Murdoch, the son of media magnate Rupert Murdoch, stepped down as the chairman of BSkyB on Tuesday, the British satellite broadcaster announced. He has been hammered by accusations that News Corp.'s British Sunday tabloid the News of the World systematically eavesdropped illegally on crime victims, politicians, celebrities and veterans in search of stories. Murdoch, 39, has consistently denied knowing about the scale of phone hacking at the paper, which he ordered shut down last summer in the face of the scandal. He referred to it in his resignation, saying: ""I am determined that the interests of BSkyB should not be undermined by matters outside the scope of this company."" He made clear he was trying to shield the satellite broadcaster from fallout from the newspaper scandal, saying: ""I believe that my resignation will help to ensure that there is no false conflation with events at a separate organization."" Murdoch will stay on as a non-executive director of BSkyB. BSkyB shares in London fell about half a percentage point on the news of his resignation, and the Murdoch family's News Corp. fell about the same at the open in New York. The resignation comes on the heels of his stepping down from News Corp.'s British newspaper publishing companies in the wake of scandals over the past year. When he quit as chairman of News International in February, the company said it was to focus on News Corp.'s pay television services. London's Metropolitan Police are conducting three separate investigations into the scandal, which also includes allegations of e-mail hacking and police bribery. Dozens of people have been arrested but no one has been charged. Two parliamentary committees and an independent inquiry led by a judge are also probing the scandal. The scandal broke as News Corp. moved to expand its ownership of BSkyB last summer -- a plan it shelved as politicians and the public expressed outrage about the hacking of the voice mail of a missing teenage girl who later turned out to have been murdered. James Murdoch has been seen as a potential heir to his father's media empire. He has twice been called to testify before lawmakers in London about what he knew of misconduct by staff at News International. In a letter to parliament's Culture, Media and Sport committee last month, James Murdoch said he could have asked more questions of senior officers at the firm, but rejected the suggestion that his resignation as chief executive reflected unrevealed knowledge relating to the scandal. ""I take my share of responsibility for not uncovering wrongdoing earlier,"" he wrote in the letter, dated March 12 and published by lawmakers. A News Corp. board meeting is scheduled for later Tuesday. CNN's Kendra Wates contributed to this report .","NEW: James Murdoch says he is quitting to shield BSkyB from a newspaper scandal .

"(CNN) -- Twitter, which has a history of complying with court requests for users' data, appears to be drawing a line in the sand. The company filed a motion in a New York State court on Monday to quash a court order that would force it to hand over data pertaining to a user involved with the Occupy Wall Street movement, according to a blog post from the American Civil Liberties Union. Malcom Harris, the user in question, is being prosecuted by the District Attorney's office in Manhattan for disorderly conduct during the Occupy movement's march across the Brooklyn Bridge last year. The prosecution is asking Twitter for Harris's email address and all his tweets over a three-month period. Twitter, however, countered that the court would need a search warrant to get that information. It pointed to a recent Supreme Court decision which found that attaching a GPS device is considered a search under the Fourth Amendment, which prevents unreasonable searches and seizures. ""If the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement applies merely to surveillance of one's location in public areas for 28 days, it also applies to the District Attorney's effort to force Twitter to produce over three months worth of a citizen's substantive communications, regardless of whether the government alleges those communications are public or private,"" wrote Twitter in its motion. Twitter also suggested that Harris owns his own tweets and could therefore file a motion to quash on his own, despite the prosecution's assertion of the opposite. The ACLU is calling Twitter's move a ""big deal."" ""If Internet users cannot protect their own constitutional rights, the only hope is that Internet companies do so,"" wrote Aden Fine, senior staff attorney at the ACLU. ""That is why it is so important to encourage those companies that we all increasingly rely on to do what they can to protect their customers' free speech and privacy rights."" Harris, who tweets under the handle @BigMeanInternet, welcomed the news becoming public. ""@BigMeanInternet : Oh sweet, it's public. Twitter motioned to quash my subpoena all on their own, saying that I do retain rights to my content."" He also expressed gratitude toward Twitter for defending his personal information. ""Twitter's Terms of Service make absolutely clear that its users own their content,"" a spokesperson from Twitter told Mashable. ""Our filing with the court reaffirms our steadfast commitment to defending those rights for our users."" Earlier this year, Twitter gave the Boston Police Department one users' data. Another user subpoenaed by law enforcement, Jeff Rae, told Mashable that he would be filing his own motion last March. Rae called Twitter's recent decision ""excellent."" ""I think that this goes to show that Twitter realizes what allowing the state to subpoena accounts can do to their credibility to social and political movements,"" Rae told Mashable via email. ""Twitter has one of the better user policies out there (they actually notify their users of subpoenas), and to see them standing up to fight subpoenas like this is promising.""

"(CNN) -- I have so few images of myself as a baby that 30 years ago, when I first picked up a camera, I never could have imagined that my imagery of other babies would resonate around the world. Since then, I've been fortunate to photograph thousands of children, and within these images I've always tried to convey the purity, beauty and innocence of the newborn. I truly feel that they represent the very essence of our existence and when they are with me in my studio they always bring joy to my heart. The vulnerability of the newborn -- without care, nourishment, love and attention they cannot survive -- is a fact of life. Every mother reading this will remember the moment when she first gazed into the eyes of her baby. Out of that fog which can constitute childbirth, we are not only automatically transported into our new lives as mothers, but that essential nurturing instinct instantly becomes part of us, as we promise ourselves that we will do everything we can to protect the new life we have created. And after giving birth, we as women become members of the vast sisterhood of mothers -- a universal oneness; a shared experience to which we can all relate. As the global advocate for the United Nations Foundation's Shot@Life campaign, and as a part of my commitment to support the Every Woman Every Child initiative, this Mother's Day I ask all mothers to pause for a moment. Spare a thought for another mother in the world who feels exactly the same way about her own child as you do about yours, yet is helpless to protect them against common diseases such as measles, pneumonia, diarrhea or polio. Ultimately Shot@Life aims to help save the lives of the 1.5 million children under the age of 5 who die every year from diseases that are entirely preventable by vaccines. Please don't be overwhelmed by these statistics -- within your heart just imagine one child and one mother. It is very difficult for any parent in a developed country to comprehend that $20 can save the life of a child. Put yourself in another mother's shoes. If someone were to say to you, ""I can save the life of your child for $20,"" what would your response be? Shot@Life aims to save the lives of 1,000 children by Mother's Day, and I think we can achieve this goal. If just 1,000 people gave $20 each in celebration of Mother's Day, we could save the lives of 1,000 children. How hard can it be? A thousand children saved, and the pain of a thousand mothers eased. Collectively, our babies are a compelling and persuasive symbol of hope and the transforming power of unconditional love. Let's make sure that all of our children live to realize their potential. Together we can all make a difference.To help reach our Mother's Day goal, click here. Follow Anne Geddes on her blog, Facebook and Twitter.

"(EW.com) -- Passion defies reason in ""The Deep Blue Sea."" And in this typically exquisite, nuanced, memory-infused work from master British filmmaker Terence Davies (""The House of Mirth""), we believe every minute of the torment of Hester (Rachel Weisz), a cultivated woman who's married (passionlessly) to a solicitous magistrate named Sir William (Simon Russell Beale) but is helplessly in thrall to Freddie (Tom Hiddleston from ""War Horse"" and ""Thor""), a younger, drink-prone chap who will never love her the way she does him. Never mind. Hester leaves her marriage for Freddie. She abandons upper-class comfort to move in with him, and when he forgets to be home on her birthday -- golf with his mates was what he fancied -- she tries to gas herself to death in their dinky flat. (That's no spoiler. It happens in the first scene.) Davies adapted ""The Deep Blue Sea"" from the 1952 play of the same name by Terence Rattigan as part of the centenary celebration of the late British playwright. It's easy to see why the material spoke to the director: With his painterly filmmaking style, his characteristic interest in the intersection between longing and restraint, and his ongoing fascination with the early postwar England of his own childhood, Davies has been able to shape the stage play to his strengths, telling the story from Hester's point of view. It helps that Weisz, in one of her finest performances, opens herself beautifully to vulnerability and folly. It's also important that, as played by Beale and Hiddleston, no man is the villain. In interviews, Davies has given aesthetic shout-outs to both the movies of Doris Day and the quintessentially British thwarted-passion drama from 1945, ""Brief Encounter."" The muted yet rich palette of ""The Deep Blue Sea,"" the calm compositions and the gently flowing pace, though, are all his. Collectors of perfect tracking shots will be thrilled by one in a tube station during the Blitz. And fans of Davies since his early, autobiographical films ""Distant Voices,"" ""Still Lives,"" and ""The Long Day Closes"" will appreciate the inclusion of one of his favorite time-capsule gestures: a warm pub scene in which every patron, young and old, joins in singing popular tunes.

"(CNN) -- Last week, in a segment called ""Only in America"" on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight,"" Piers Morgan begged Hollywood to end its love affair with the 1980s. He expressed his disappointment in the fact that not only did ""21 Jump Street"" earn $35 million at the box office opening weekend, but a sequel is already in the works. Referring to Hollywood's vision as ""backward,"" Morgan said that the movie industry relies too heavily upon familiar characters and plot lines in order to tap into that ""quaint nostalgia factor... that drives all Republican candidates to try and prove they're the most like Ronald Reagan."" Morgan predicted that if the trend didn't stop soon, in 30 years he'd be forced to endure ""Jersey Shore: The Movie"" or ""Growing Pains"" in 3D. But what about the people who grew up in the '80s and watched movies and TV shows about the '50s and '60s, such as ""Stand by Me"" and ""The Wonder Years""? Piper Weiss, editor at Yahoo! Shine, told CNN that '80s movies waxed nostalgic about the '50s ""because the directors then grew up in the '50s and were starting to come of age and have real power in Hollywood."" Today, history is repeating itself. Now the people who grew up in the '80s are the Hollywood heavyweights green lighting projects. ""If you were a young, naive child in the '80s like I was,"" said Weiss, ""you thought of Reagan and jellybeans when you thought of the '80s. You didn't really understand the things that you understand when you're an adult."" Weiss, 33, pointed out that people, like she, who were small children in the '80s were ""too young to know that there were good and bad things to pop culture"" because they hadn't reached that age of awareness yet, so as far as they were concerned, ""everything was super awesome."" Weiss suggested that maybe Morgan, whose 47th birthday is today, can't relate because he had already reached that ""awareness"" age by the '80s. ""We have such a fondness for it,"" said Weiss, ""but it's because that was a time of pure, unfiltered, uncynical enjoyment of pop culture."" Weiss suggested that her generation is coming of age in terms of power, whereas perhaps the generation ahead feels a little insecure. Remember, while a lot of '80s films were throwbacks to the 20-30 years before, the '90s and early 2000s were dotted with '70s remakes and re-imaginings, such as ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Almost Famous,"" ""Anchorman"" (By the way, Ron Burgundy's coming back -- a sequel was announced earlier this week) and TV's ""That '70s Show."" That generation wanted to distance itself from the '80s in a lot of ways, and people once again started wearing bell-bottoms and boot-cut jeans. Weiss, who noted that she's beginning to age out of the demographic that Hollywood is targeting, said it's easy to feel neglected. Sean Phillips, executive producer at Yahoo! Movies, agrees with Morgan and also thinks Hollywood needs to generate some new material. People ""go for the warm,"" but at the same time audiences have wised up, said Phillips, who noted that ""Footloose,"" for example, bombed at the box office. Phillips is also averse to Hollywood's turning old TV shows -- not just ""21 Jump Street"" -- into movies. He said that audiences may get excited when they see the poster, but for the most part it insults their intelligence. Phillips calls ""21 Jump Street"" a remake ""in name only."" It wouldn't necessarily be associated with the original TV series, save for the cameos. For one thing, the movie is a comedy; the series was a drama. It appears there are two camps on how to approach and appreciate remakes: Some want literal interpretations that serve as amped-up versions of the originals (e.g. ""Charlie's Angels""), and others prefer movies like ""21 Jump Street,"" which barely resemble their yesteryear counterparts. Weiss lsaid that for a remake to work it needs ""some sort of meta-element or link."" She said that, while she thought Hollywood butchered ""Arthur"" -- because Dudley Moore cannot be replaced -- she has high hopes for a potential ""Ghostbusters 3."" ""If you're gonna remake Ghostbusters, I would like not just for Bill Murray to have a cameo, I want him to be the star, along with Harold Ramis and Dan Ackroyd."" People shouldn't be afraid to ""watch people age in a remake,"" she said. There's also the issue of actually getting people to movie theaters. Familiar titles and warm-and-fuzzy memories can help sell tickets. Weiss noted that there's a corporate reasoning behind doing remakes well ""and not just making people buy tickets because they're suckers."" When ""Dirty Dancing"" got green-lighted for a remake, some diehard fans of the 1987 Patrick Swayze/Jennifer Grey classic firmly objected. But their pain may have been alleviated by the fact that Kenny Ortega, who choreographed the original, is directing the new version. The film industry is relying on so-called name brands in order to get an older demographic that might not be as willing to part with its money for movie tickets. It also serves as a nice was to clue in younger generations about the past. ""It's kind of fun to have a reason to introduce our pop culture past to kids today and make them more media-literate in terms of how their stuff has been influenced by the stuff we grew up with,"" Weiss said. Weiss pointed out that ""21 Jump Street,"" ""Arthur"" and ""The A-Team"" are more like ""one-offs"" designed to introduce a slicker version of the same old brand. The trend can be found in fashion as well. T-shirts with '80s fonts are big, as is neon -- lipstick, shoes, handbags, Katy Perry's hair; even fluorescent household appliances are flying off store shelves. Another reason why the '80s is coming back is because the era was so hi-tech, comparatively. ""Movies went from low-budget auteur to big blockbusters,"" said Weiss, ""and that coincides with where we're at now, as depressing as that sounds. We're almost like the Super '80s. ... We're what Max Headroom dreamed things would be like. It's almost like we're in an '80s do-over with new and improved fantasy technology."" Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- Officials will conduct an autopsy Monday on Mark Niver, a drag racer who died when the parachute came off the back of his dragster -- sending him slamming into the netting at the end of the track. Niver, 60, was taking part in the National Hot Rod Association's Lucas Oil Northwest Nationals in Seattle, Washington, on Sunday. After the parachute came off, he was able to slow the car a bit before plowing into the net fencing at the end of the drag strip. The death was the second this year in the association's drag racing series. Race announcers called Niver ""a true craftsman and an innovator"" who hand-built all his race cars from start to finish -- he machined his engines and components and fabricated the car bodies.

"(Wired) -- After releasing two generations of iPhones with exactly the same form factor, Apple is expected to show off a new chassis design -- and possibly new materials -- in its sixth-generation smartphone. And a little-known alloy that Apple has quietly been using for the past two years could be just the ticket to make consumers swoon. Korea IT News reported Wednesday that the iPhone 5 is likely to be housed in Liquidmetal, the commercial name for an alloy of titanium, zirconium, nickel, copper and other metals. It would make the outer surface of the phone ""smooth like liquid,"" according to the report. ""The next iPhone needs to truly stand out from the crowd,"" Canalys analyst Chris Jones told Wired via email. ""A change in materials is a likely way to differentiate its form factor."" Liquidmetal was discovered at the California Institute of Technology in 1992. It's a class of patented amorphous metal alloys (basically metallic glass) with unique properties including high strength, high wear resistance against scratching and denting, and a good strength-to-weight ratio. Apple was granted rights to use it in August of 2010. ""Liquidmetal allows precision parts to be fabricated similar to plastic injection molding, but with similar properties to metal,"" IHS senior principal analyst Kevin Keller said. In today's metal-based gadgets, you either need to bend a piece of sheet metal, or die-cast with an inferior alloy like aluminum or magnesium. In die-casting, the alloys tend to be brittle and have poor wear resistance. Liquidmetal's injection molding process is still a relatively new technology, and it's fairly expensive -- but that's not necessarily anything that Apple would shy away from. Liquidmetal has been used in Apple products (as well as those of other manufacturers) for several years. The SIM card ejector tool in some North American first-generation iPads was made of Liquidmetal, and since then, Keller said, it's been used in a number of other internal parts and small mechanical components. ""We expect Apple and other manufacturers to start using this not only for larger and more visible portions of devices, but also entire enclosures,"" Keller said. Thus, a Liquidmetal iPhone chassis seems entirely reasonable to expect in the not-too-distant future. Jones also noted that the discovery and use of new materials was one of Steve Jobs' obsessions. ""But Apple will need to ensure a change in material does not compromise the performance of the device,"" he added, noting the infamous ""antenna-gate"" issue with the iPhone 4. Reports that an upcoming iPhone could have a metal back and a unibody case have been circling since well before the iPhone 4S was announced.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. secretary of defense said Monday that he doubts Iran has been able to reverse-engineer a U.S. spy drone that crashed last year in the Iranian desert to learn its secrets. ""I would seriously question their ability to do what they say they have done,"" Leon Panetta told reporters traveling with him to Colombia. His comments came a day after Iran said it had ""cracked the codes"" of the intelligence-gathering system in the drone it captured last year for violating its airspace, the nation's semiofficial media reported. Tehran bragged that it had seized the aircraft in December and displayed it on national television as a victory for Iran. On Sunday, an Iranian senior military official said the country's military had extracted data from the aircraft in order to prove to the Pentagon that it had been able to decode it. ""This plane is seen as a national capital for us, and our words should not disclose all the information that we have very easily,"" Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the semiofficial Fars News Agency. ""Yet, I provide four cues in here to let the Americans know how deep we could penetrate into (the intelligence systems and devices of) this drone."" Data from the drone's memory revealed it had flown over the Pakistani hideout of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden two weeks before his death in May, according to Hajizadeh. ""Had we not accessed the plane's softwares and hard discs, we wouldn't have been able to achieve these facts,"" he said. Iran has also decoded information including protocols, repairs and flight sorties, said the military leader, who commands the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps' aerospace forces. The drone was in California in October 2010 for repairs and was moved to Afghanistan the following month, but it had problems that U.S. experts could not solve, he said. Retired Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks, a CNN contributor, said the U.S. military should be concerned about this report. ""We have to assume the compromise of the drone is complete,"" he said Monday on CNN's ""Early Start."" ""They can pick apart different pieces of this drone."" Marks said U.S. officials need to be concerned about how Iran can use this information to counter American technology. In December, President Barack Obama said the United States had asked Iran to return the drone it said it had. At the time, two U.S. officials said the missing drone was part of a CIA reconnaissance mission that involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in Afghanistan. ""We've asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond,"" Obama said. Iranian military officials have vowed not to return the plane.","NEW: ""I would seriously question their ability to do what they say they have done,"" Panetta says .

"(CNN) -- Afghans continued to grieve, and continued to fume, as a new day dawned on Sunday, exactly one week after a U.S. soldier -- described by some who knew him as ""happy"" and a ""nice guy"" -- allegedly went house to house, shooting dead 16 villagers. Much to the villagers' disgust, decorated combat veteran Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales is more than 7,000 miles away from where he is suspected of single-handedly carrying out the grisly attack. Attorney Emma Scanlan said in a statement late Saturday that she and two other members of Bales' defense team plan ""to spend several days meeting"" with their client next week. She said others have accurately cast Bales ""as a level-headed, experienced soldier."" ""Sgt. Bales' family is stunned in the face of this tragedy, but they stand behind the man they know as a devoted husband, father and dedicated members of the armed services,"" Scanlan said. Bales is accused of leaving a remote U.S. combat outpost on foot before dawn on March 10 and killing people in their homes in villages in the Panjwai district of Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province. He arrived late Friday at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he is being held in solitary pre-trial confinement at the Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility, the Army said Saturday in a statement. The chilling images of bloodied, limp bodies -- among the dead, nine children -- from that rampage are difficult to reconcile with positive recollections of some who know him growing up, as well as an official military account documenting his humanitarian battlefield exploits. Bales attended elementary, middle and high school in Norwood, Ohio, a suburb of just over 19,000 people, located five miles northeast of Cincinnati, according to people who knew him. Family friends who knew him growing up spoke highly of Bales. He played football and graduated in 1991 from Norwood High School. ""He was quiet,"" one woman said. ""He's just a very nice person, not arrogant, just a nice guy."" He then attended and played football at the College of Mount St. Joseph in Cincinnati, two family friends said Saturday. Records indicate Bales later lived at multiple addresses in the Columbus area, not far from Ohio State University. He joined the Army two months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and was assigned in September 2002 to Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, according to a brief summary released Saturday by the Army. It listed multiple decorations for Bales, including three Army ""good conduct"" medals. He deployed to Iraq right after the 2003 invasion and then again in 2006, when he served 15 straight months as part of then-President Bush's so-called surge of 20,000 additional troops. According to one of Bales' attorneys John Henry Browne, the soldier was wounded that tour and had to have part of his foot amputated. An Army account recalled a 2007 incident in Iraq, when an operation to recover a helicopter that had been shot down near Najaf turned into more of a humanitarian one to help wounded civilians. Bales, who was serving then as a team leader, said he was ""proud"" and his unit ""discriminated between the bad guys and the noncombatants and then afterward we ended up helping the people that three or four hours before were trying to kill us."" ""I think that's the real difference between being an American as opposed to being a bad guy, someone who puts his family in harm's way like that,"" he said in the account, posted online in February 2009. The soldier went to Iraq a final time between 2009 and 2010, according to the military. This time, he suffered a traumatic brain injury after his vehicle flipped after striking a roadside bomb, his attorney said. Bales deployed to Afghanistan in January with the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division for his fourth combat tour. Before then, he'd been living near Lewis-McChord with his wife and two young children in Lake Tapps, in a house that he and his wife purchased for $280,000 in 2006, according to records. That two-story house was put on the market this week with a $229,000 asking price, according to realty records. It was vacant Friday afternoon, its front porch littered with boxes and children's toys. Neighbor Cassie Holland described the Bales family as ""happy"" and ""normal."" ""I mean, we would go over there for birthday parties and they would come to my kids' birthday parties,"" she said. ""I would describe (Bales) as super fun to hang around with, kind of the life of the party kinda guy. Super loving, great with his kids. I don't see how this has happened."" Bales and his family ""were not happy"" that he'd been deployed to Afghanistan on what ultimately became his fourth combat tour, his lawyer said, citing conversations with the soldier's family. ""He was told that he was not going to be redeployed,"" Browne said. ""The family was counting on him not being redeployed."" According to excerpts of blog posts written by Bales' wife a year ago and published Friday by The Tacoma News-Tribune, the family was disappointed that Bales had not been promoted to sergeant first class. ""It is very disappointing after all of the work Bob has done and all the sacrifices he has made for his love of his country, family and friends,"" Karilyn Bales wrote. ""I am sad and disappointed too, but I am also relieved, we can finally move on to the next phase of our lives."" The family was preparing to move last year and hoped to be stationed in either Germany, Italy, Hawaii, Kentucky to ""be near Bob's family,"" or Georgia ""to be a sniper teacher,"" she said, according to the News-Tribune. On the homefront, public records show that Bales had a brush with the law in 2002, when he faced a criminal assault charge in a Tacoma court. He pleaded not guilty. A judge ordered anger-management counseling for Bales, the Wall Street Journal reported. The case was dismissed, records show. He has not yet been formally charged in relation to the Afghanistan killings, though the military has made a determination of probable cause that allows him to be detained. The military has seven days to bring Bales in front of a magistrate and 120 days to take him to trial, said Greg Rinckey, a former judge advocate. Neighbors and relatives of those killed, meanwhile, are demanding Bales return to Afghanistan to face justice. ""Punish him in Afghanistan. Put him on trial here and heal our broken hearts,"" one villager told Afghan President Hamid Karzai during a meeting with the victims' families on Friday. At this meeting, Karzai suggested U.S.-Afghan relations were at a breaking point. ""It is by all means the end of the rope here,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Over the past few weeks, cities have continued to remove Occupy Wall Street protesters from their encampments. Occupy has responded to these ejections by changing its focus from public spaces toward private property: foreclosed homes. This shift may end up leaving Occupy even stronger than it was before the ejections began. It answers critics who have accused Occupy of lacking a political program and will help the movement build stronger ties with working-class Americans. To understand why, it helps to view Occupy in the context of earlier social movements that employed similar tactics. A straight line runs from the 1930s sit-down strikes in Flint, Michigan, to the 1960 lunch-counter sit-ins to the occupation of Alcatraz by Native American activists in 1969 to Occupy Wall Street. Occupations employ physical possession to communicate intense dissent, exhibited by a willingness to break the law and to suffer the -- occasionally violent -- consequences. Effective occupations, however, have managed to do more than convey intensity. They have crafted visible signs of the reality protesters hope to create, thereby spurring legal change. The sit-down strikes arguably laid the groundwork for the enforcement of federal labor laws; the lunch counter sit-ins led to the enactment of Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; and the Alcatraz occupation paved the way for a milestone reversal in Federal Indian policy, leading President Nixon to support tribal self-determination. The sit-down strike movement began January 27, 1936, when workers at the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. in Akron, Ohio, sat down on the job to protest the company's suspension of an official in the workers' union. Fifty-five hours later, the company capitulated, reinstating the union official with back pay and even compensating the strikers (at half-pay) for the time during which they occupied the plant. Successful imitation strikes were soon launched at other tire factories. Workers were willing to use nonlethal force to defend their occupations, and they managed to repel attempts to forcibly remove them. The number of strikes mushroomed. In 1937 alone, roughly 400,000 workers participated in nearly 500 sit-down strikes. The GM sit-down strike in Flint involved tens of thousands of workers and was resolved just as the Supreme Court was hearing arguments in a pivotal case concerning the constitutionality of federal labor laws. Indeed, several legal historians attribute the court's famous ""switch in time"" -- upholding the National Labor Relations Act in the case of NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. -- to the sit-down strikes. A generation later, the 1960 sit-ins began as seemingly spontaneous lunch-counter occupations by college students in Greensboro, North Carolina. They quickly spread to dozens of cities throughout the South. Now canonized, at the time they were extremely controversial, even among African-American civil-rights veterans. Thurgood Marshall was notoriously furious with the students for violating private property rights in a way that he both opposed in principle and feared might generate a backlash. Despite Marshall's worries, the students were more successful than anyone could have hoped. They were well-organized and committed to nonviolence, and their quiet discipline was only made more visible by the hoodlums who frequently assaulted them. Their actions smoothed the road for the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which (among other things) prohibits racial discrimination at lunch counters. Although political theorists typically make room in their accounts of democratic politics for principled disobedience, most distinguish conscientious lawbreaking from disobedience motivated by self-interest. But the categories of self-interested and conscientious lawbreaking are not easily separated. Moreover, far from discrediting acts of disobedience, an intermingling of the strategy of principled lawbreaking with a degree of self-interest can actually render a protest more intelligible to nonparticipants. What has puzzled many observers about the Occupy Wall Street protests is precisely the lack of an obvious connection between their disobedience (the occupation of parks and streets) and their political and economic complaints. This is why Occupy's turn toward foreclosed housing is so important. While it takes heroic acts of imagination to connect the dots between the occupation of Zuccotti Park and worries about economic inequality, political corruption and the excessive power of banks, the connection between these issues and the occupation of foreclosed housing is obvious. A great deal of America's vacant housing sits in the hands of the very financial institutions whose profiteering brought us the current Great Recession. Not content with the billions in bailouts showered on them by a federal government that seems beholden to their interests, those institutions have resisted efforts to get them to restructure underwater mortgages. To make matters worse, many of these same banks have brazenly abused foreclosure procedures through practices like robo-signing. As numerous state courts have observed, abuse of the foreclosure process has been the rule rather than the exception. The bankers' claims to foreclosed properties are morally suspect, and occupation of those properties directly confronts this illegitimacy. The ejection of the Occupy Wall Street protesters from public spaces may, in the long run, work to the movement's benefit. In shifting their efforts away from public parks and toward foreclosed homes, Occupy is forging a tighter link between its acts of occupation and its political objections. This will ultimately enhance the effectiveness of its message. It also brings Occupy Wall Street more closely into line with the most effective occupation movements of the past century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","Katyal and Peñalver: Occupy Wall Street is shifting its focus to foreclosed homes .

"(CNN) -- Iran has recalled a diplomat from Brazil amid allegations he sexually abused children at a swimming pool, state media in Brazil reported. The case will be ""seriously considered,"" Ramin Mehmanparast, a spokesman for the Iranian foreign affairs ministry, said Tuesday, according to Agencia Brasil. The 51-year-old diplomat allegedly fondled the genitals of boys and girls -- ages 9 to 14 -- on April 14 at Neighborhood Social Club No. 1 in the capital, Brasilia, the news agency said. It was not immediately known in what capacity the man worked at the Iranian embassy in Brazil. As the children reported the alleged sexual assaults that took place during a birthday party, angry parents confronted the diplomat, with at least one parent assaulting him, CNN affiliate G1 reported. ""When the staff discovered it was a case of pedophilia they wanted to kill him,"" the father of a 14-year-old girl said, according to G1. ""If the club had not deployed those security guards, today you would be interviewing me to speak of a murder or lynching."" The alleged events were reported to a local military police station, which responded to the scene, a statement from the social club said. The diplomat had been a member of the club for about a year at the time of the alleged assaults. His membership has since been suspended, the social club said. Iran's promise to investigate the allegations is a change in position after initially calling the incident a ""misunderstanding arising from differences in cultural behavior"" and a result of media bias, a statement from the Iranian embassy in Brazil said. At the time, Brazilian Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota pressed Iran for additional information. ""We would like a clarification from the embassy regarding the very worrying accusations,"" Patriota said, according to Agencia Brasil. ""We hope to get to the bottom of the facts and from there decide what measure to take."" Iran and Brazil have enjoyed largely amicable relations for more than a century. Iran also has worked to strengthen ties with Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia and Cuba. It has opened six embassies in the region since 2005.

"Paris (CNN) -- France votes Sunday in a presidential runoff pitting incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy against Francois Hollande in an election dominated by economy, unemployment and immigration concerns. Campaigning concluded at midnight Friday. In the first round of voting, nearly a fifth of voters backed far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen -- who wants to limit the number of immigrants entering France -- leading both candidates to reach out to her supporters. In his final address Friday in Paris, Sarkozy, of the center-right UMP party, picked up on the debate over immigration as he appealed for the support of the whole nation. ""I've always said that France needs to remain an open and profoundly humanistic country, but there is a reality that is that we have welcomed more people in France than we can manage,"" he said. ""I'm not speaking to the right, the left or the center, this is a presidential election. I am president of France. I must speak to the French, no matter who they are."" Hollande, of the center-left Socialist party, also appealed for unity at his final rally in Perigueux, southwestern France. ""If so many of you have come today, it's because you know that Sunday you will make an important choice for our future. If there are so many of you, it's because you want to express your worry, and you have expressed this in multiple ways in the first round of the elections,"" he said. ""There have been votes in this very neighborhood that went to the National Front. We have the responsibility to unite, to reconcile. I don't want a France that is divided."" The two rivals traded insults earlier this week in the only televised head-to-head debate of the campaign. Sarkozy labeled Hollande a liar and a ""little slanderer"" while Hollande accused the president of shirking his responsibilities, cronyism and favoring the privileged over France's poor. Sarkozy has defended his economic record, despite low growth and unemployment at close to 10%, saying the impact of Europe's debt crisis could have been far worse. Both candidates have been working hard to reach out to France's undecided voters in the two weeks since the first-round vote on April 22 left them the only two still in the race. Centrist Francois Bayrou, who took 9% of the first round vote, delivered a boost to Hollande's campaign Thursday when he said he would vote for the Socialist, and urged his supporters to vote according to their conscience. Le Pen, who said she would cast a blank vote on Sunday, declined to endorse either candidate. Under French election law, no opinion polls or partial results can be published before the polls close at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday. If elected, Hollande would be France's first left-wing president since Francois Mitterrand left office in 1995. Sarkozy has been president since 2007.

"London (CNN) -- Thousands of members of the British Armed Forces took part in a parade and flypast at Windsor Castle Saturday as part of celebrations to mark Queen Elizabeth II's 60 years on the throne. World War II era Spitfires and Lancaster bombers, helicopters and Tornado fighters were among the 78 aircraft to soar overhead as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee tribute. The flypast also featured Hawks flying in a formation to represent the Queen's initials and Tucanos flying in a ""60"" formation for the length of her reign. On the ground, some 2,500 military personnel from the Army, Navy and Royal Air Force paraded past the Queen, who was colorfully dressed in blue, in a specially built arena in the castle grounds. Speaking at the event, Gen. Sir David Richards, Chief of the Defence Staff, said the three branches of the Armed Forces took great pride in marking the jubilee. ""The Queen's deep interest and commitment to the Armed Forces has touched many Servicemen and women and their families over the past 60 years,"" he said. ""I know I speak for all those who have the privilege to wear her uniform, when I offer my heartfelt thanks to Her Majesty for her dedication to the Armed Forces, and to our country."" The Queen was joined in the audience by Prince Philip and other members of the British royal family, as well as more than 3,000 military personnel, veterans and their families. Monarchs from Denmark, Brunei, Lesotho, Norway, Sweden, Swaziland and Tonga were among a number of foreign royals to attend. The military parade and flypast are the first major national event to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee, the Ministry of Defence said. The central weekend of celebrations comes in early June, when the Queen will take part in concerts and a pageant involving more than 1,000 boats on the River Thames. The Queen hosted a lunch on Friday at Windsor Castle to which every monarch in the world was invited, also as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall also hosted a dinner at Buckingham Palace on Friday evening for some of the royals. Human rights campaigners criticized the decision to include monarchs of countries with a poor record on human rights in Friday's events. Among those they highlighted were the king of Bahrain, whose government has come under fire for its handling of continuing unrest, and Swaziland's King Mswati III, accused by critics of enjoying a lavish lifestyle at public expense while his people suffer great poverty.

"(EW.com) -- In its short, sweet first season, Shonda Rhimes' Scandal introduced powerhouse political fixer Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) and her powerful associates, including President Fitzgerald ""Fitz"" Grant himself (Tony Goldwyn). Before ""Scandal's"" Blu-ray/DVD hits stores tomorrow, Washington shared with EW her favorite moments from the D.C. drama, discussed her electrifying chemistry with Goldwyn, and even dished on season 2. Though Washington claimed to love the ""dirty work of acting,"" she clearly prefers watching co-star Guillermo Diaz ""torture"" another actor rather than the steamy scene she shared with Goldwyn. ""That stuff is not fun, at all,"" she said. ""Those are private moments. But that's what acting is -- it's about... having the courage to allow your audience into the private moments of your characters' lives. Those are difficult."" Another kind of torture? Not letting herself be paralyzed by the knowledge the man with whom she's steaming up the small screen is happily married. It's just an occupational hazard, though: ""Anybody who cares about somebody who has to do scenes like that [has to be] really compassionate."" She adds, ""Tony's very in love with his wife and his daughters, who I've met. It's all good!"" Never fear, Fitz fans! Washington assured, ""I know Tony's still going to be around"" when the show resumes filming in July. But that doesn't mean all Olivia's relationships are secure. How will Olivia react when she learns what peppy underling Quinn has been hiding? ""A lot of that depends on who she is,"" said Washington.

"(CNN) -- ""We looked at ports in Europe. We looked at street signs. Things on the menu."" In the end, comedian Kevin Nealon and his wife decided to name their son Gable. As in Clark Gable. They simply liked the sound of it, and most people will agree it's far better than Helsinki, 43rd Avenue or Never Ending Pasta Bowl. This was 4Â½ years ago, but the former ""Saturday Night Live"" star still loves to talk about his son. In 2009, he even published a book about becoming a first-time dad called ""Yes, You're Pregnant, But What About Me?"" ""We finally got the pacifier away from him,"" Nealon says of Gable. ""And now we're potty training him. It would've been easier to get the pacifier away from him if we taught him how to pee on it."" Nealon describes himself as a hands-on father but admits, ""It's because I don't work that much."" In that sense, he sort of sounds like his character, Doug Wilson, on Showtime's ""Weeds,"" a pot-smoking, former CPA-drifter with a pretty much nonexistent moral compass. However, as you'll see and hear in our recent video interview, Nealon and Doug Wilson are really nothing alike. ""I have a lot of hobbies, and I have a lot of friends,"" he says. ""And I'm not so insecure as Doug."" They have even greater differences, but everyone still loves Doug. For all his faults and failures, fans just can't get enough of the self-centered, shamed city councilman of fictional Agrestic, and he has become, perhaps, Nealon's most beloved character on TV. This, from the man who spent a decade on ""SNL,"" ""entertaining viewers with Hans and Franz and Mr. Subliminal.

"(CNN) -- Timothy Bradley shook the boxing world after a stunning split decision against Manny Pacquiao to win the WBO welterweight title. Pacquiao appeared to dominate Bradley during the fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Saturday night, but the judges felt otherwise. Two of the ringside judges had the fight 115-113 for Bradley while the other judge scored it 115-113 for Pacquiao.

"(CNN) -- A Florida man lit the mother of his 4-year-old son on fire early Monday, then chased her with a knife before she found refuge inside a convenience store, police said. Roosevelt Mondesir, 52, was in jail Monday night after being charged with attempted first-degree murder, said Boynton Beach police spokeswoman Stephanie Slater. His alleged victim is at a Delray Beach hospital recovering from severe burns to much of her body and face. The woman is expected to survive her injuries, Slater said. Surveillance video shows the woman standing near a gas pump shortly before 3 a.m. Monday in her silver Mercedes Benz, as a man driving a white Jaguar -- later identified by authorities as Mondesir -- approaches. The two are at one point seen struggling. The woman tries to seek refuge inside the 7-Eleven, but is soon dragged back outside. The video later shows the woman running around on the pavement outside the store, the upper part of her body enveloped in flames. According to the report from the Boynton Beach Police Department, the woman -- interviewed about two hours later at Delray Medical Center, but not identified by police -- said she had gone to the 7-Eleven intending to meet her son's father and son for a ""timesharing exchange."" She and Mondesir don't live together but they share custody of their 4-year-old child, the woman said. After realizing her son wasn't in Mondesir's car, the burning victim says she tried to get back in her vehicle. It was then that Mondesir came out with a red-colored can and began tossing gas on the woman and her vehicle, the woman told police. She ran, but after being pulled out of the 7-Eleven the first time, Mondesir ""threw fire onto her body"" and she ""became engulfed in flames,"" according to police. ""The victim began to put the fire out and remove her shirt, and then realized the ... defendant was also armed with a long (possibly machete) knife,"" police said. Officers arrived to find the woman ""with severe and fresh burns"" on her body and face, as well as pieces of her still burning shirt on the ground. Mondesir had run from the scene, leaving his Jaguar parked near the gas pumps. Boynton Beach police found him around 5:45 a.m. Monday in bushes near the 7-Eleven. After being treated himself at a local medical facility for burns, he is now in Palm Beach County's main detention center, according to the sheriff's office website. Sue Kohl, who lives across the street from Mondesir, describes him as friendly and helpful. Kohl said she was shocked to hear about the incident, which occurred about one-quarter mile from her and Mondesir's homes.

"(CNN) -- A new report released Monday lists Somalia, Eritrea and Haiti among the world's worst places to be a school child because of poor access to education. The report, from the Global Campaign for Education based in South Africa, ranked countries on factors including access to basic education, teacher-to-student ratio and educational provision for girls. The report says 69 million children who should be in school are not. The worldwide economic crisis has also taken its toll on education, the report states. ""Millions of children are becoming the victims of the financial crisis with poor countries' education budgets being cut by $4.6 billion a year,"" the study concluded. ""In the last twelve months Kenya had to delay the provision for free education to 9.7 million children due to budgetary constraints."" Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who was recently appointed to the High Level Panel for the Global Campaign for Education, said in a news release that ""generations will be condemned to poverty"" if education budgets are not protected from the financial crisis. The study says the unequal provision of education has led to 8.2 million children out of primary school in Nigeria, adding that many girls there receive six months of education in their lives. The campaign is calling on world leaders meeting at the Millennium Development Goals summit in New York this week to make funding for education a priority to meet a target of universal access to basic schooling by 2015. The campaign said greater access to education can also result in significant health improvements.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Coast Guard officers continued to search for survivors Tuesday after a boat carrying 28 Haitian migrants ran into trouble in the Bahamas while on its way to the United States, leading to at least 11 deaths. Thirteen people are believed missing, the U.S. Coast Guard said Tuesday. Four of those on board made it safely to shore Monday and raised the alarm with the Bahamas police force, U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer Jon-Paul Rios said. The hunt for survivors continued early Tuesday, with U.S. Coast Guard officers scanning the seas from the air and Bahamian police conducting surface searches. The Haitians' vessel ran aground and broke up near Hawksbill Cay in the Bahamas, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard sent three aircraft, one of them a rescue helicopter, to the scene after Bahamian authorities asked for help and recovered 11 bodies there, Rios said.

The United States has long been a destination for migrants from Haiti, with many sailing via the Bahamas or the Turks and Caicos Islands. Boats overflowing with migrants fleeing persecution under the regime of Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier began landing on U.S. shores in the 1970s. Others sought refuge after the collapse of the Duvalier dictatorship in the late 1980s, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Council urges probe of sinking refugee boats . In the early 1990s, tens of thousands more Haitians migrated to the United States after the coup d'etat deposing President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The January 2010 earthquake that devastated the capital, Port au Prince, and surrounding communities did not result in an immediate wave of mass migration to the United States, as some had feared. Nonetheless, about 587,000 Haitian-born people were living in the United States as of 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, about half of whom are naturalized U.S. citizens. That number had climbed from 408,000 in 2000 and 218,000 in 1990, according to a 2010 report by the U.S.-based Center for Immigration Studies, citing earlier census figures. At least 16 dead after migrant boat sinks near Dominican Republic . Nearly half the migrants from Haiti have settled in Florida, with New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts also attracting sizable communities, the CIS report says. A fifth of Haitian immigrants and their young children residing in the United States live in poverty, it adds. The Haitian diaspora has traditionally helped its Caribbean homeland recover from natural disasters, with large sums sent back to Haiti in remittances, the Migration Policy Institute says. The United Nations estimates the January 2010 earthquake affected nearly 3 million people and killed about 220,000. More than 1.5 million people were left homeless in a country that was already the poorest in the Western Hemisphere and racked by crisis.

"(AOL Autos) -- If you have a heavy foot and may travel a bit over the speed limit, you might want to keep an eye out for these popular police car models. Not all police cars are as clearly marked as this one. What to watch for on the interstate . The Ford Crown Victoria is the most popular police car currently in production. Renowned for its durability, many speeders have seen this unfortunate sight in their rear view mirror. But there are other patrol vehicles that road warriors should recognize, and many of them are faster than the popular Crown Vicky. Ford Crown Victoria Interceptor: The standard . Officers value the Ford Crown Victoria Interceptor for its durability, size, and overall performance. These cruisers feature reinforced frames, a special 4.6-liter V-8, and other heavy-duty components that enable them to handle high-speed chases. According to The Michigan State Police, the fastest Crown Victoria Interceptor will hit 128 mph. Chevrolet Impala: Under the radar . The Chevy Impala is one of the best-selling cars in the U.S. This makes it the perfect choice for police departments who want a car that blends in with traffic. The Impala's familiar shape doesn't stand out or call attention to itself. Fitted with the special Police Package (code 9C1), this mid-size sedan with a 3.9-liter V-6 engine hits an impressive 140 mph. Chevrolet Tahoe: Probably not taking kids to soccer camp . Some police departments need the strength and power that only a full-size SUV can deliver. Fitted with the special PPV option, the big Chevy Tahoe SUV can hit 133 mph thanks to its high-performance 5.3-liter V-8 with 320 horsepower. Look for the black wheels with tiny center hubcaps as a tip-off should you see one unmarked or without a light bar. Dodge Magnum: The wagon that knows how to haul . Dodge produced their last Magnum police car in 2008, but many police departments still have these station wagons in service. Fitted with the legendary 5.7-liter HEMI V-8, the wagon can hit 131 mph and charge up to that speed with muscle-car type performance. The wagon sprints from 0-60 mph in under six seconds. AOL Autos: Wonder wagons . HUMMER H3: Special duty . The H3 may be the smallest model in the HUMMER family, but it remains a very capable off-road vehicle. The police-version of the H3 is fortified for running off-road and carries other equipment necessary for police duty. The H3 can be equipped with a 5.3-liter V-8, but high-speed pursuit is not this vehicle's forte, except when the chase is across a desert, through fields, or over the Rubicon. Harley-Davidson Electra Glide: King of the road . Police departments also utilize an assortment of motorcycles in their quest to keep motorists safe. The Michigan State Police test two-wheelers on an annual basis and the Harley-Davidson Electra Glide is a perennial favorite. While the Harley offers other performance benefits, with a top speed of just 104 mph, they are not the best for high-speed pursuits. Dodge Charger: That cop car's got a HEMI! The sight of a Dodge Charger police car should be enough to make you think twice about attempting to out run an officer behind the wheel of one of these. Equipped with the 5.7-liter HEMI V-8, the Charger can hit a staggering 146 mph. This makes the Dodge the fastest mainstream police car available. But what about vehicles that aren't mainstream? AOL Autos: Fast cars --join the 600 horsepower club . Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 . Harper Woods, Michigan borders Detroit: It's a relatively quiet bedroom community that packs a big surprise for anyone speeding on the section of Interstate 94 running across its borders: a 2005 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500. Acquired to boost ""community relations"" and to intimidate speeders, the Shelby's supercharged 5.4-liter V-8 puts out 450 horsepower and will easily exceed 150 mph. AOL Autos: First drive of 2010 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 . Police ID: What to look for in unmarked vehicles . Departments often use unmarked vehicles, many of which will be identical to their fully outfitted cruisers. Unmarked cars and trucks enable more stealthy operations. Tips for identifying unmarked police cars include looking for; light bars mounted in the rear window, municipal license plates, painted black wheels, and dividers between the front and rear seats. AOL Autos: Cops in the sky . Future cop car: Coming to a highway near you . Carbon Motors, a new company located in Georgia, is developing the E7, a purpose-built police interceptor. With a wheelbase of 122-inches and an overall length of 200-inches, the E7 is bigger than current Crown Victoria or Charger cop cars. Power for the E7 will be a 300-horsepower clean-diesel that should give the car a top-speed of 155 mph.

"(CNN) -- Champion cyclist Lance Armstrong said Wednesday the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency intends to ""dredge up discredited"" doping allegations against him in a bid to strip him of his seven Tour de France victories. The Washington Post said it received a copy of a 15-page agency letter sent Tuesday to Armstrong and several others. As a result of the allegations, Armstrong was immediately banned from competing in triathlons, a sport he took up after retiring from professional bicycling, the newspaper reported on its website. Armstrong, as he has in the past, said he has never engaged in doping. ""Unlike many of my accusers, I have competed as an endurance athlete for 25 years with no spike in performance, passed more than 500 drug tests and never failed one,"" Armstrong said on his website. ""That USADA ignores this fundamental distinction and charges me instead of the admitted dopers says far more about USADA, its lack of fairness and this vendetta than it does about my guilt or innocence."" Justice Department prosecutors in February said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against Armstrong. They had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong was accused of using such drugs by other riders, but never failed a drug test. ""These are the very same charges and the same witnesses that the Justice Department chose not to pursue after a two-year investigation,"" Armstrong said Wednesday. According to the Post, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency alleged it collected blood samples from Armstrong in 2009 and 2010 that were ""fully consistent with blood manipulation including EPO use and/or blood transfusions."" The allegations were previously unpublicized, according to the Post. Opinion: Why fans shouldn't forgive Armstrong . The letter says Armstrong and five former cycling team associates engaged in a doping conspiracy from 1998 to 2011, the Post reported. Riders will testify that Armstrong used EPO, blood transfusions, testosterone and masking agents, and that he distributed and administered drugs to other cyclists from 1998 to 2005, the Post quoted the letter as saying. In a statement obtained by CNN, U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis T. Tygart said the five other people, formerly associated with the U.S. Postal Service pro cycling team, are three team doctors and two team officials. The letter included written notice of alleged anti-doping rule violations, Tygart said . ""USADA only initiates matters supported by the evidence,"" Tygart said. ""We do not choose whether or not we do our job based on outside pressures, intimidation or for any reason other than the evidence."" All named individuals are presumed innocent until proven otherwise, he added. His statement did not mention anything about Armstrong's status as a triathlete. According to its website, the quasi-government agency is recognized as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic events in the United States. Armstrong lashed out at the organization, saying it has ""self-written rules"" and that it punishes first and adjudicates the facts later. Armstrong has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 Tour de France, resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year. Armstrong came out fighting once again in May 2011 in the face of fresh allegations made on the CBS News ""60 Minutes"" show by another American, Tyler Hamilton. In the CBS interview, Hamilton -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself -- says he first saw Armstrong use blood boosting substance EPO in 1999, the year of his first Tour de France victory. ""I saw it in his refrigerator,"" Hamilton told the American news program. ""I saw him inject it more than one time like we all did, like I did many, many times."" On his Twitter page, Armstrong at the time said he never failed a drug test. Ex-teammate: I saw Lance Armstrong inject banned substances .

"(CNN) -- Finally, fans of the world's most famous boy wizard can follow his fight against the evil Lord Voldemort on their e-readers. The entire ""Harry Potter"" series is now available in digital form at Pottermore, author J.K. Rowling's website for all things Potter, ending what was easily the biggest e-book holdout in the literary world. The books come in a downloadable format that is compatible with all leading e-readers, tablets, personal computers and smartphones -- including Amazon's Kindle and Barnes & Noble's Nook. Readers seeking the e-books on Amazon or Barnes & Noble's site will be directed to Pottermore to buy them. ""For years our customers have loved reading Harry Potter books in print, and have made them the best-selling print book series on Amazon.com,"" said Russ Grandinetti, Amazon's vice president of Kindle content. ""We're excited that Harry Potter fans worldwide are now able to read J.K. Rowling's fantastic books on their Kindles and free Kindle reading apps."" ""By offering the NOOK editions of this popular series, long-time fans and first-time readers can experience the magic of Harry Potter in a new, exciting way and read what they love, anywhere they like,"" offered Jim Hilt, Vice President of e-books for Barnes & Noble. All seven books in the series will be available in English, at prices ranging from $7.99 to $9.99, through an agreement with Pottermore. Rowling didn't agree to make the books available digitally at all until last year, a full 14 years after the first, ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"" was published. (It was published in the United States as ""Sorcerer's Stone"" the following year). ""I wanted to give something back to the fans that have followed Harry so devotedly over the years, and to bring the stories to a new digital generation,"" the British author said last year in an announcement on YouTube. ""I hope fans and those new to Harry will have as much fun helping to shape Pottermore as I have."" The content side of the Pottermore site, which promises users an interactive journey through the Harry Potter universe, is still in beta testing. It's scheduled to go live in April. Not always a fan of the latest technology, Rowling famously wrote the Potter series by hand. Through the years, Rowling and her representatives expressed two reasons for being slow to the e-book world: a fear of online piracy and the desire for readers to experience her books the old-fashioned way. The Harry Potter books have sold more than 400 million copies and been translated into more than 60 languages. Tuesday's e-book launch is the second time Rowling has made news in recent weeks. Late last month, she announced that she's working on an adult novel -- rumored to be a crime thriller.","'Harry Potter' books finally come to Kindle, Nook .

"(CNN) -- The shooting death of a 21-year-old Mississippi State University student in a campus dorm room is thought to be an ""isolated incident,"" and there is no indication others are endangered, the school's president said Sunday. Campus police were notified about 10 p.m. Saturday of an incident in Evans Hall, a dorm for male students on the northwest side of the campus, Mark Keenum said Sunday. John Sanderson, of Madison, Mississippi, was found with ""what appeared to be serious injuries"" in the dorm. He was transported to a nearby hospital, but ""unfortunately could not be saved,"" Keenum said. Bill Kibler, vice president for student affairs at the Starkville, Mississippi, school, said Saturday the victim was shot more than once. Three men who did not appear to be university students were seen fleeing in a blue sedan, he said. The shooting prompted the school to send out a campus-wide alert through a series of text messages. The school's emergency response procedures ""were executed quickly and effectively last night,"" Keenum said Sunday. Early Sunday morning, police were talking to witnesses and reviewing surveillance tapes. Campus police stepped up patrols, Keenum said, assisted by officers from Starkville and the Oktibbeha County Sheriff's Office. ""Throughout the night and into this morning, we have kept the campus informed of developments through our Maroon Alert emergency notification system,"" the president said. ""But we have had no indication that there is a danger to others and we believe this was an isolated incident."" Keenum said he could not release many details because of the ongoing investigation, led by university police and assisted by authorities from the city, county and the Mississippi Highway Patrol. ""Our Bulldog Family is saddened by this event and the loss of one of our students,"" he said. ""Our hearts go out to John Sanderson's family and friends. They continue to be in our prayers."" Campus safety, he said, is a top priority. ""This is the first time in our school's history that such a tragic incident has occurred, involving a student being shot on campus,"" he said. ""Our campus is known as a safe place, and I want to assure students, parents, faculty and staff that it continues to be safe."" ""Mississippi State University's main campus is located in a rural, low crime area,"" the university website said. ""Serious emergencies happen rarely and are usually weather related -- ice storms and wind events.""

"(EW.com) -- Regal Cinemas, the largest theater chain in the country, will play the unrated documentary ""Bully"" in its theaters, the company announced today. ""Regal intends to play the film and respect the original R rating decision of the MPAA,"" says Regal spokesperson Dick Westerling. ""We will treat the film like it was rated R."" The decision means children 17 and under must be accompanied by a parent or guardian to see the film. The move strikes a harder line than the one taken by AMC Theaters, which is allowing minors to see the acclaimed film -- which chronicles the epidemic of brutal adolescent bullying -- as long as they have written permission from a parent or guardian. Meanwhile, The Los Angeles Times is reporting that Carmike and Cinemark theaters will not be screening ""Bully,"" adhering to a long-standing tradition by major theater chains of not showing films that do not carry a rating by the MPAA. The Weinstein Company decided on Monday that it would release the film unrated after the MPAA refused to lower the R rating it gave the film last month. It opens in five theaters in New York and Los Angeles on Friday, and begins expanding nationwide in the weeks ahead. See the full article at EW.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Bobby Rush's hoodie on the House floor sure got attention. ""Racial profiling has to stop,"" he announced as he took off his suit jacket to reveal a hoodie, which he immediately pulled over his head. His speech was cut short by the loud clicking of a gavel, and an admonition to leave the chamber for breaching rules of decorum. The move was intended to highlight the Trayvon Martin shooting case in Florida, but it also raised questions about attire in the House. House officials said Rush broke a rule that says members ""may not wear a hat."" Another rule says representatives have to ""wear appropriate business attire in the chamber."" In the wake of Rush's removal from the House, some members are complaining that rules are unevenly enforced. It is not unusual to see lawmakers entering the House chamber in jeans, sneakers and other clothing that is supposed to be banned. Late last year Rep. Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, wore a memorable outfit that certainly did not qualify as appropriate business attire. In the politest of terms, it was a form fitting blue T-shirt underneath his blazer. Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Emanuel Cleaver told CNN he supports the House rules aimed at proper decorum, but he also said -- in the wake of the Rush incident -- they must now be enforced across the board. ""It's not uncommon to see people in the back (of the House chamber) with sweatshirts on, and we have traditionally allowed that to happen. I don't think that can happen anymore,"" said Cleaver. In fact, standing at the bottom of the Capitol steps on Thursday as the House was holding its final pre-recess votes, Cleaver said he had just seen people ""with all kinds of things on."" ""When you selectively enforce the rules it can cause people to believe you're enforcing them on the basis on political view or basis of partisan politics,"" Cleaver said. Translation: House officials must start cracking down on the dress code, so no one can say Rush was singled out because of politics, party or race. House Speaker John Boehner is famously fixated on appearances, stopping people in hallways and calling them out at press conferences about a bad outfit or messy hair. For example, earlier this month he told a reporter to button his shirt. ""You don't have to look like a reporter,"" Boehner quipped. One of Boehner's most famous tongue-in-cheek moments was in 2009, when he spent much of a press conference commenting on the way people looked. ""You really do need to do something with that hair of yours,"" he said to one reporter. ""Get a brush, will ya?"" he said to another. A natty dresser himself, Boehner is such a stickler that minutes after an emotional farewell to Gabby Giffords in January, he banged the gavel and bellowed, ""the chair would remind all members to be in proper business attire when you come to the floor of the House."" We asked Boehner about Cleaver's concern that the rules are not uniformly enforced. ""I think the rules are enforced evenly,"" Boehner replied. ""I've asked members of both sides of the aisle to leave the floor myself. I know the sergeant of arms has asked members to leave the floor. We expect all members to follow the rules and the rules make it clear that members will be on the floor with proper business attire,"" he said. The day that Rush wore his hoodie on the House floor, several other members also brought their own sweatshirts, but didn't end up wearing them after Rush was escorted out for breaking the rules. Cleaver told CNN several members of the Congressional Black Caucus and others had asked him to put one on, but he declined, out of respect for House decorum. He said Boehner needs to tell House officials to work harder. ""What needs to happen is the speaker is going to have to tell every sergeant at arms that no matter what, people must confirm to the rules,"" Cleaver said.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- An Irish priest at the center of a gay porn controversy has asked to leave his parish and take sabbatical leave from the priesthood, he said Sunday. The Catholic Church in Ireland had launched an investigation after reports Father Martin McVeigh accidentally showed pictures of naked men to parents of children preparing for their First Holy Communion. The incident happened at the start of a PowerPoint presentation at a grade school in Pomeroy, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland in March, said the leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Cardinal Sean Brady. Parents said in a statement they were ""horrified"" by what they saw and called for action to be taken against the priest. The church reported the incident to police, who said no crime had been committed. In a statement Sunday, McVeigh apologized ""for the hurt caused"" and ""his failure to check his presentation in advance."" However, he insisted he ""was not responsible for the presence of the offending images and in this respect I ask you to accept my innocence."" The priest also confirmed he had destroyed the memory stick that contained the images. He said: ""After the images were inadvertently shown, I immediately removed the memory stick from the laptop. In my shock and upset and in my concern to ensure that the images would never be shown again, I destroyed it later that evening."" McVeigh described the past month as ""the most difficult"" of his life and said he would be taking a break. ""In the hope of bringing resolution and healing to the division and pain within the parish, I have taken the decision to ask Cardinal Brady to allow me to leave the parish of Pomeroy and to take sabbatical leave,"" said McVeigh, adding: ""The memory of this awful episode will remain with me for the rest of my life."" Brady said he accepted McVeigh had no advance knowledge of the pornography. In a statement Sunday, Brady said it had been ""a traumatic time for the whole parish community and for Father McVeigh personally."" The cardinal also apologized for the incident. He issued an update on the church investigation, saying other computers used by McVeigh had been ""forensically examined by an independent technical expert and no inappropriate imagery has been found."" Brady added an additional laptop stolen from the local church sacristy since the March 26 meeting ""did not form part of the technical examination."" The cardinal said he had accepted McVeigh's request for leave on the understanding he would return to the diocese on its completion. The latest controversy comes after a series of child sex abuse scandals involving Catholic Church clergy in Ireland. The government-backed investigations say thousands of children have been abused by priests and other church figures over the last 80 years. In March, the Vatican released a major report into the problem, begging forgiveness from victims. However, victims hit out at the report's finding that new safeguards are working.","Father Martin McVeigh says he showed ""offending imagery"" to parents .

"(CNN) -- Best known for quirky rom-coms like ""Say Anything,"" ""High Fidelity"" and ""Grosse Pointe Blank,"" John Cusack returns this weekend in a gothic murder mystery entitled ""The Raven."" Cusack plays author Edgar Allan Poe. But instead of treating the story like your standard biopic, the author finds himself at the center of a serial killer investigation, where the killer is using Poe's work for inspiration. In a rare instance in which a film portrays a writer as an actual hero, the downtrodden Poe becomes integral in solving the case, with Cusack portraying the famed writer in a very serious and dark manner. CNN recently spoke with Cusack about channeling Poe and the mash-up styles ""The Raven"" uses as inspiration. CNN: Edgar Allan Poe is quite insane at times. Do you relate to him at all? John Cusack: It's funny, we were talking to people and somebody says that Poe reminded them of Kurt Cobain. Everybody has some tangential relationship to [Poe]. He represents this singularity and a defiance, intellectually so rebellious, and so tragic and sad. He's almost like an archetype of a young shadow ... he's the Godfather of Goth. The reason he's so famous and stands the test of time ... he led an eccentric life, and a really sad life; tormented, but he represents some sort of collective sorrow. Poetic, luminous quality. Anybody who wants to be an artist in any way, an actor or a writer, in trying to express the world in some way, Poe is the blasted soul, the perpetual orphan out there who houses all of those feelings. He's become that. I think that's what he represents in the collective way. CNN: You mentioned Cobain -- both died and their work has lived on, assimilating in different ways into the collective consciousness. Cusack: Yeah, I can see [Poe's] writing influencing Hunter Thompson, who I knew and was a friend. His influences are all over: From literary, music, fashion, everything with this writing about the space between life and death, between being awake and dreaming. When he was 20 years old, he said ""I could not love, except where death was mingling his with beauty's bated breath."" So he's always juxtaposing almost idolatry -- the eternal feminine and the harshness of the world. He's always caught in that space. CNN: And although he was published, he was poor mainly because copyright isn't what it is today in terms of royalties and paying artists. Cusack: There was no copyright at all, so he got paid $6 for ""The Raven"" and then it went all over the world. He was one of the first persons to try and make a living as a writer. It was almost impossible. Writing for pennies per word. He was really destitute and struggling. At one point he was eating dandelion salads. CNN: ""The Raven"" itself is very dark and gruesome at times. Cusack: Well, we always went back to the source material. We thought the construct was very Poe-like, where Poe becomes a part of one of his stories and swept up in one of his genres. I thought that conceit was very smart; you have to have Poe deconstruct his own stories to find the killer. So, not only do you get to use all the attitudes about his own work, but you also have the other thing, ""Am I going insane?"" bit. The dance with the abyss, the madness, the mental illness. You have all those things and try to do a story that is fiction that tries to get you inside the head of Poe. It allows for more scope than I think a biopic would. CNN: It's a very meta-treatment of his life and work. Cusack: It's one of these weird things, if you go into it thinking this is ""The King's Speech"" or a ""Masterpiece Theater"" version of a really depressed guy ... if you do the research, he was very brutal and mercurial in his moods. He wasn't this inward looking sorrow master. If you understand his writing, he was an esoteric poet on a master level, but also writing pulp for Saturday afternoon thrillers. Someone said, ""Why hasn't the story of Poe been done?"" I don't think anyone's figured out how to get the breadth of him. This was a way to get into him, his stories and mix it with some fantasies. You're right in when you describe it as a meta-treatment. That is what we were going for. People need to understand what they're seeing or looking at is the film that we intended to make. It does need a little bit of context; you need to have read Poe a little bit more than English class to get what we were going for. CNN: Poe was alive when horses were the main source of travel. Do you feel comfortable acting while riding on horses? Cusack: Yeah, yeah, I don't mind doing that stuff. I love it all. I'm good with horses. CNN: How would you classify ""The Raven""? Cusack: I think it's a mash-up of a few things: Horror, thriller, a bit fantasy, but it's also a character study and a look at the creative process. Styles and genres that Poe made. There's a tendency to put things in these boxes, but I think Poe was doing a lot of things. He created a lot of these genres.","John Cusack plays author Edgar Allan Poe in ""The Raven""

"Athens (CNN) -- Robbers broke into a museum in Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympics, tied and gagged a museum guard, and fled with stolen artifacts, Greek authorities said Friday. The two men raided the Museum of the History of the Olympic Games, a smaller building close to the main Archaeological Museum of Olympia, just after 7:30 a.m. local time, said Athanassios Kokkalakis, a police spokesman. The robbers ""approached the museum's guard, tied her hands and bound her mouth and then went into the museum, where they took 65 to 68 small clay and brass small statues, and a gold ring, and put them in a bag and left."" Culture Minister Pavlos Geroulanos submitted his resignation after the robbery took place, the prime minister's office said. Geroulanos' office said his offer to step down not yet been accepted. The minister is on his way to Olympia to view the scene of the robbery. It is the second big theft of this kind this year in Greece. In January three art works, including a painting by Pablo Picasso and another by Piet Mondrian, were stolen from the National Gallery in Athens. Dimitra Koutsoumba, president of the Greek Archaeologists' Association, said the latest attack was a sad and worrying incident. ""It is the first time that we have an armed robbery at a museum during operating hours. It shows that the cuts the Culture Ministry has made since the crisis hit in 2009 make it easier for such incidents to take place,"" she said. ""The minister himself had told us that the cuts were ranging between 30% and 35%, and they include cuts in personnel."" She called for more importance to be placed on cultural heritage and said greater steps should be taken to protect irreplaceable items that belong to the nation. ""Such incidents are an issue of national security,"" she said. ""The artifacts that were taken were mainly figurines related to the Olympics, so many were depicting athletes."" The museum, built on an ancient site in the Peloponnese peninsula, is considered among the most important in Greece. The ceremony for the lighting of the Olympic flame for the 2012 London Olympics is scheduled to take place on May 10 at the Ancient Olympia site, where the museum is located. The first Olympic Games were held in Olympia in 776 B.C. to celebrate the deity Zeus. A sanctuary at the site was dedicated to him.","NEW: Culture Minister Pavlos Geroulanos is traveling to Olympia to see the robbery scene .

"(CNN) -- The wave of pornographic and violent images that flooded Facebook over the past few days has drawn attention to a side of the social networking mega-site most of its users don't think about: . Facebook is a coveted prize for hackers. ""It's hard to put it into perspective as to how good a job they're doing (at preventing spam), because they have a giant target on their back,"" said Chester Wisniewski, a senior analyst with security firm Sophos. ""They have a giant target on their back with the user base they have. Every spammer's got a dream of catching them."" In this week's attack, a hack that exploited security flaws in some Web browsers sent images of porn, Photoshopped pictures of celebrities in compromising positions and images of intense violence to millions of users, according to Facebook. Users apparently were duped into copying malicious code into their browser windows, helping the images spread. Many Facebook users were outraged by the fact that porn made its way onto the social network. On one hand, the offensive images call into question Facebook's ability to rein in spam as it becomes more popular. On the other, it's a counterintuitive testament to Facebook's spam-fighting abilities that users were surprised to see these nasty images showing up on the social network. If this happened on e-mail, after all, no one would blink. Less than 4% of the content shared on the Facebook is spam, Facebook says. Compare that with e-mail, where a whopping 89% of content is spam, as CNN partner site Mashable reports. Less than 5% of the site's members experience spam on any given day, Facebook said in October. Meanwhile, only 0.06% of its 1 billion log-ins per day are compromised, the site says. (Of course, that's still 600,000, so someone could shade that number to make it sound miniscule or huge, depending on intent.) To Wisnieswski, the way Facebook responds to spam and other hacks is a mixed bag. Generally, he says, they're quick to jump on the big problems but slower on the day-to-day stuff. ""If it's malware-related ... scams and spam and things like that ... they're pretty good about it,"" he said. ""They're very conscious about the fact that they don't want their users to be infected. ""But with the survey scams and things, they don't seem to be that effective."" Facebook, of course, is far more likely to agree with the former point than the latter. Spokesman Andrew Noyes says that, on a site under virtually constant attack, the Facebook team is constantly working to protect its users. ""We believe the security fight requires a multipronged approach,"" he said. ""In addition to our dedicated legal team, Facebook also has security experts and engineers focused on the integrity of the site. We're continuing to build systems to prevent and respond to spam attacks. Our User Operations team also works around the clock to identify problems and assist those affected."" Noyes said Facebook's security team has identified the hackers behind this week's attack and are ""working with our legal team to ensure appropriate consequences follow."" In recent months, the site has launched several public tools and initiatives trying to stay ahead of the inevitable attacks. Last month, Facebook announced two tools it's testing: Trusted Friends and App Passwords. Trusted Friends would help users get back into their account if their password is changed without their knowledge. App Passwords would add a layer of security when users approve third-party apps. This summer, Facebook launched a ""Bug Bounty"" program that pays people for reporting security problems, and a suite of security tools rolled out in May includes ""clickjacking"" protection and remote log-ins. In January, users got the ability to surf Facebook with a secure browser setting. ""We work regularly with analysts, engineers, fraud experts, and security investigators to prevent abuse, defeat criminals, and help maintain Facebook as a trusted environment,"" Noyes said in an email. In fact, there are some built-in advantages to the way Facebook works that help keep the level of spam lower than with e-mail, a relative Wild West for spammers and scammers. As he pondered upcoming changes to Facebook messaging last year, Craigslist founder Craig Newmark noted in a blog post that the site's requirements for creating an account help. ""The deal is that a Facebook identity (profile) pretty much ensures that there's a real person behind it,"" Newmark wrote. ""It's possible to fake a Facebook identity, but it's a fair amount of work, way more expensive than getting a new Gmail or Hotmail account."" While acknowledging those efforts, Wisnewski says there are still some holes in Facebook's security game. A major one, he says, is the Facebook app development process. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly celebrated the millions of third-party app developers registered with the site. But that means there are millions of people who get expanded access to Facebook data just for paying a nominal fee. ""Because Facebook doesn't verify anything about you or have any human review process at all ... we see these guys create hundreds of developer accounts for the same scam,"" he said. Wisnewski also wishes Facebook would add additional layers of security every time users start up an app. ""If they really want to get a grip on this, there are a few things they could do -- but the things they could do, by Zuckerberg's worldview, would slow down innovation."" All that said, Facebook has a track record of aggressively going after scammers and spammers once they're caught. In August, self-proclaimed ""Spam King"" Sanford Wallace was indicted in a California court. Two years ago, Facebook sued him and a federal court ordered him to pay $711 million. Previously, Facebook won a $360 million judgment against spammer Philip Porembski and, in 2008, was awarded the largest award ever under federal anti-spam laws -- $873 million -- after suing Adam Guerbuez and Atlantis Blue Capital for sending objectionable images on the site, according to news reports.","Facebook porn spam casts light on site as a target for hackers .

"(CNN) -- The assistant coach of Togo's national soccer team is among the victims of Friday's machine-gun attack on a bus carrying the squad to a tournament in Angola, the country's official news agency reported Saturday. As many as three people were killed and nine injured in the strike, which prompted the team to decide Saturday to pull out of the Africa Cup of Nations tourney. Angola's official ANGOP news agency reported that assistant coach Hamelet Abulo and a Togolese journalist died Saturday. There were conflicting reports about the driver of the bus. Fraser Lamond -- regional medical director of SOS International, a group that transports injured people to hospitals -- said the driver was among the dead, but Togo government officials indicated he was still alive. Lamond said a third wounded person was being evacuated to Johannesburg, South Africa, for treatment. ANGOP reported that goalkeeper Kodjovi Kadja, was sent to South Africa for an injury to his back. It was unclear whether Lamond and ANGOP were referring to the same person. The team was headed to Angola for the tournament when it was attacked near the border between Angola and the Republic of Congo. An armed wing of a separatist group -- the Forces for Liberation of the State of Cabinda (FLEC) -- has claimed responsibility for the attack and has threatened to strike again. CNN cannot independently verify the claim. Emmanuel Adebayor, the Togo team's captain and a star for England's Manchester City team, said he and his teammates met Saturday morning ""before deciding that they wished to pull out of the tournament,"" the Manchester City Football Club Web site said. He was not injured in the attack, Manchester City said. ""It's as if we've gone to war,"" said goalkeeper Kossi Agassa. ""It's deplorable for Africa. I don't know what other countries will decide, but it's hard. Too hard for us footballers."" Angolan officials -- trying to assuage security fears that could dampen the war-torn nation's sporting aspirations -- vowed to heighten security, particularly in Cabinda, a disputed oil-rich enclave located within the Democratic Republic of Congo and the site of eight matches in the tournament. Togo had been scheduled to play Ghana on Monday in Cabinda. ""We vehemently condemn the ignoble action, lament the loss of lives, and we reiterate our commitment to guarantee security so that the CAN ORANGE 2010 (tournament) will firm itself as a great sporting event and a manifestation of friendship and solidarity among the African people,"" an Angolan government statement said. Arriving Saturday with a high-level delegation to Cabinda, Angola's Prime Minister Antonio Paulo Cassoma insisted his government provided proper security. ""Security was guaranteed. Nevertheless ... we will provide more security and protection to the delegations,"" Cassoma told Angola's TPA Television. Leaders of the Confederation of African Football were expected to meet Saturday with Cassoma ""to take decisions to guarantee the smooth running of the competition,"" a statement on that organization's Web site said. Host nation Angola is scheduled to kick off the tournament against Mali on Sunday in Luanda. The tournament -- one of the world's biggest -- is Angola's first major sporting event since a 2002 peace deal brought the southern African country's decades-old civil war to an end. It also marks the beginning of a year in the spotlight for African football, with South Africa set to become the continent's first country to host the FIFA World Cup in June. The Angola tournament has been eagerly anticipated as an early chance to assess the form of African powerhouses such as Drogba and Toure's Ivory Coast, Essien's Ghana and Eto'o's Cameroon ahead of the World Cup. Football world government body FIFA said it was ""deeply moved"" by the incident and expressed ""utmost sympathy"" with the Togolese players. It said it expected a full report from the CAF on the situation. Togo striker Thomas Dossevi, who plays for French team Nantes, told CNN ""armed rebels"" with AK-47s had opened fire. ""We were attacked by armed rebels who used Kalashnikovs. We had just passed the border and a couple of minutes later we were attacked from both sides. ""We hid below the seats -- we had police protection in front and behind but we were attacked from both sides. As soon as I heard the bullets I went to the floor. ... The attack lasted for 10-15 minutes, "" Dossevi said. Cabinda is located within the Democratic Republic of Congo. A strip of that nation separates it from Angola, one of the world's largest energy producers and a major supplier of petroleum and liquefied natural gas to the U.S. market. Angola, which was wracked by civil war for nearly three decades, brokered a peace deal in 2006 with separatists seeking an independent republic of Cabinda. Togo is a strip of a nation that averages about 60 miles wide, nestled between Benin and Ghana in West Africa. It is smaller than the U.S. state of West Virginia.","NEW: Angola news agency: Togo assistant coach Hamelet Abulo, Togolese journalist dead .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Campaign workers distributed campaign leaflets and plastered candidate posters along the Iranian capital's tree-lined streets in the final days before Friday's parliamentary elections. Iranian cell phones also lit up with text messages advertising names of candidates. Meanwhile, Iranian state television broadcast wall-to-wall programming encouraging voters to cast their ballots. With slogans like ""Our progress in science and economics depends on your vote,"" the publicity campaign included an oft-repeated quote from the late founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, saying, ""The measure of a nation is its vote."" But out on the traffic-clogged streets of Tehran, some Iranians appeared less than enthusiastic about the election. At the Al Javad Mosque where young men were handing out campaign leaflets, an elderly man confronted a passing turbaned cleric, yelling ""Why should we vote?"" When a CNN reporter asked another man about the election, he hurried away, saying ""I'm not going to vote, so I'm afraid to talk."" ""I don't want to take part in this election,"" said another young man, who asked not to be named. Asked why he was boycotting the vote, he answered, ""Everyone has his own viewpoint. For example, someone says 'I like the system.' Or someone says 'I don't. I'm the opposite of the system.' And that's why."" In Iran, elections are traditionally heralded by the revolutionary regime as a popular demonstration that it enjoys the overwhelming support of the population. But this Friday's contest will also mark the first time Iranians go to the polls since allegations of vote-rigging during presidential elections in 2009 triggered mass street demonstrations against the regime. Security forces subsequently used deadly force to crack down on the opposition Green Movement. Presidential candidates Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Kerroubi were placed under house arrest, where they remain. International human rights organization reported the arrest of thousands of other activists. Scores of high-ranking opposition campaign workers and political activists fled to exile to neighboring Turkey, where some claimed in interviews with CNN that they endured torture in Iranian prisons. But at a campaign rally for candidates from the conservative Principalist Front on Wednesday, one lawmaker running for re-election offered a decidedly different account of the aftermath of the 2009 vote. ""During the 2009 elections, attempts were made to use cheating in the elections as an excuse to plot against the regime,"" said Zohreh Elahian. ""Attempts were made to show the world that there is no democracy in Iran and that the people are not the ones who have the power to elect their leaders,"" she said. ""That's why the Friday elections represent the people's will to participate in determining their own future and their country's fate."" There are no candidates from the Green Movement in this year's parliamentary election. Instead, Iranian political analysts describe Friday's vote as a contest between rival conservative factions within the government. ""The underlying issue is whether or not you support [Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad,"" said Sadegh Zibakalam, a political scientist at Tehran University. ""It's a rivalry between Ahmadinejad on the one hand and the supreme leader on the other...not overtly, and not directly of course."" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly supported Ahmadinejad's controversial re-election victory during the dispute over the 2009 ballot results. But tensions have flared between the two leaders over the last year. Ahmadinejad disappeared from public view for 11 days after Khamenei over-ruled his decision to fire an intelligence minister. Several of Ahmadinejad's top political allies have also been subjected to lawsuits and investigations. The Keyhan newspaper, which is run by a trusted ally of Khamenei, has publicly denounced Ahmadinejad's top adviser, Esfandiar Raheem Mashaie, accusing him of ""leading a deviant current."" In the run-up to this week's vote, Khamenei has urged factions to overcome previous divisions, by calling repeatedly for unity. According to Iranian state media, there are more then 3,400 candidates competing now for some 290 seats in parliament. Iranian analysts said the Principalist Front represents one of the leading groups of candidates. It faces a challenge from a group of Ahmadinejad supporters who announced the creation of their ballot list, the Monotheism and Justice Front, just days before the election. At the Principalist Front rally on Friday, where candidates took turns addressing several hundred people seated on the floor of a mosque, candidate Zohreh Elahian sought to downplay previous divisions between pro- and anti-Ahmadinejad conservative factions. She placed all of these groups under the same ""principalist"" ideological umbrella. ""We view all the principalists as members of one family,"" she said. ""But there are differences in views and tastes which show how dynamic the principalist group still is."" Any possible divisions within the ruling conservative government fade rapidly, however, when confronted by Iran's greatest adversaries, the United States and Israel. At a speech before thousands of supporters on Wednesday, Ayatollah Khamenei accused the United States and its allies of trying to stop Iranians from voting on Friday. Intelligence Minister Heydar Moslehi went one step further, saying a ""high voter turnout will be a punch in the face of arrogant powers,"" according to state-run Press TV. This was a view shared by some on the streets of Tehran. Some Iranians blamed increasingly harsh American economic sanctions for the precipitous drop in the value of Iran's currency over the last several months. Others pointed to the recent series of assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists, which the Iranian government has blamed on foreign agents. Amid the rush of commuters moving through Tehran's busy Haft-e-Tir Square was a clerk named Ali Asgar, who said he would vote for any candidate who was honest, and who ""followed the Supreme Leader."" ""We hate the politics of the U.S. The U.S. is supporting Saudi Arabia and betraying Iran,"" Asgar said. Almost as an afterthought, he added, ""Death to America, death to Israel,"" before politely shaking hands with his interlocutor and saying goodbye.","In 2009, allegations of vote-rigging triggered protests and led to deaths .

"Washington (CNN) -- Hours before the official announcement that President Barack Obama had landed in Kabul, Afghanistan, for a surprise visit, the media -- both social and electronic -- were already buzzing with reports about the trip. Had he indeed landed in-country? Was it just a rumor? Should it be reported anyway? Some, including those inside the administration, were actively concerned about the safety of the commander in chief as he arrived in a war zone, while others felt any word of the president's visit was public information and fair game in today's competitive, instant news cycle. Before the day began, the administration issued what was later revealed to be a fake presidential schedule, having the president and vice president in meetings throughout the day at the White House. Early Tuesday morning, an Afghan official told CNN that the palace staff in Kabul was instructed to go home at noon local time, 3:30 a.m. ET, sparking rumors of a VIP visit to the city. Then, shortly after 9 a.m. ET, Afghanistan-based 24-hour news channel TOLONEWS filed a Twitter post announcing the president's supposed arrival in Afghanistan. (The tweet has since been deleted from its feed.) @TOLOnews ""BREAKING: United States President Barack Obama has arrived in Kabul to meet Afghan President Hamid Karzai."" Minutes later, The Huffington Post's Joshua Hersh retweeted @TOLOnews with a question: . @joshuahersh ""Is this right?RT @TOLOnews BREAKING: United States President Barack Obama has arrived in Kabul to meet Afghan president Hamid Karzai"" But, at 9:32 a.m, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul announced via Twitter: . @USEmbassyKabul ""Reports that President Obama is in Kabul are false."" That was enough to send the Twitterverse and traditional media buzzing. The New York Post posted a story on its website shortly after 10 a.m. reporting the president was in Afghanistan. ""Obama arrives in Afghanistan report says; White House denies it,"" read the Post's headline. The story was later removed from the paper's website. ""Where is Obama,"" read a similar headline on The Drudge Report. Many of the publications that posted early reports on the president's visit later pulled their stories. However, The Drudge Report kept its post up. Early reports often wrong . At the time, all those reports were wrong, or at least premature, according to the administration. The White House later reported Air Force One actually landed in Afghanistan at 2 p.m. ET . Yes, the president had indeed secretly traveled to Afghanistan, a trip loaded with symbolism on the one-year anniversary of Osama bin Laden's killing. But virtually all of the major media organizations that were in a position to have known about the trip did not report it until it was officially announced around 3 p.m. ET. The trip took place in the wake of security questions raised last month following a scandal that erupted when several members of a Secret Service advance team in Cartagena, Colombia, solicited prostitutes before the president's arrival at the Summit of the Americas. And in March, several news outlets, at the White House's request, removed stories about daughter Malia Obama's spring break trip to Mexico. But balancing news interests against security interests is nothing new for White House reporters. CNN's John King, host of ""John King,USA,"" said he faced a similar challenge during a trip to Iraq with then-President George W. Bush as he visited newly minted Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. ""We were told we were not supposed to tell our family,"" King told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday. ""We were supposed to tell one or two of our colleagues, meaning our bosses, and to keep it as secret as possible."" A secret rendezvous in the dark of night . News organizations who were a part of the traveling press pool covering the president's surprise Afghanistan visit -- a small group of reporters, producers and photojournalists designated to be the eyes and ears of the White House press corps during such clandestine trips -- were part of the secrecy and complied with the White House's request to hold off on reporting the information until the president was safely in Kabul, according to White House pool reports. Hours earlier, reporters had secretly gathered at a remote parking area at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, had all their electronic gear confiscated -- cell phones, laptops, cameras, ""anything that might have tracking software"" -- and were driven by bus to a darkened Air Force One waiting in the shadows on the tarmac. After an 11-hour flight, the media -- and the president -- found themselves in a steep descent into Bagram Air Field in Afghanistan, the official modified Boeing 747 still shrouded in darkness. On trips such as these, it is safest for the president to land and takeoff under cover of night. ""We landed at Bagram Airfield at 1020p local and got onto Chinook helicopters that were waiting with rotors spinning,"" reported pool producer Richard Coolidge of ABC News. ""The short flight to Kabul was also in blackout -- no use of any flashlights or even phones due to their backlit screens. Pilots and gunners used night vision goggles."" Within hours, Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai had signed a Strategic Partnership Agreement, setting the framework for a U.S. military presence in the war-torn nation for the next decade. Then, Obama addressed cheering troops at Bagram, spoke to the nation in a live remote address and was wheels-up, safely clearing Afghan airspace. ""AF1 is blacked out as it was on arrival with shades down. But the increasing light limits the value of that precaution,"" reported the press pool. ""We are on AF1 and rolling 425a local 755 pm ET."" Total time on the ground was six hours and five minutes. White House plugging holes . The early reports of the president's Afghanistan trip sent White House National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor scurrying to douse the rumors. According to the website BuzzFeed, that outlet agreed to the White House request and pulled its report after Vietor called around 9:33 a.m. The New York Post followed suit, removing its story hours later. Vietor did not respond to CNN's request for comment. ""It wasn't that hard a call,"" BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith told CNN. ""There's an appropriate tradition of deferring to White House and military requests to delay -- not spike -- a story when they believe people in a war zone could be in danger."" ""And a plane in the air above Afghanistan, the situation, as we later learned, is a pretty clear case of that,"" Smith added. ""Vietor's narrow denial also telegraphed the situation to media watchers paying close attention."" But media experts acknowledge the press has to walk a fine line between the need to get the news out and the safety of the president. Journalists must often ask themselves the question ""what does the public need to know and when do they need to know it,"" said Al Tompkins, a senior faculty member at The Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a media training organization in St. Petersburg, Florida. Tompkins said that in the harried and hypercompetitive world of reporting via social media, outlets sometimes reason that a competitor's scoop signals a green light to rush ahead with news. This is a dangerous precedent when national security is concerned, he said. ""No, you can't unring the bell, but you can stop ringing it,"" Tompkins said. Halimah Abdullah is a freelance writer based in Washington. CNN's Tim McCaughan, Nick Paton Walsh and Bryan Monroe contributed to this report .","Early reports had Obama on the ground in Afghanistan before he actually was .

"Doha, Qatar (CNN) -- Delegates representing Arab and African nations and NATO coalesced behind the Libyan rebels at a summit in Qatar on Wednesday, promising more humanitarian aid and money channeled through a temporary trust fund of sorts. Members of what is called the Libya Contact Group agreed that a temporary financial mechanism could provide a way to get money to the Libyan opposition. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said participants in the Qatari capital, Doha, were discussing the possibility of using frozen Libyan assets for the fund. ""I think this discussion about the trust fund is very interesting,"" he told reporters. ""And we will look into it because the frozen international money belongs, if it's government money, to the people of Libya."" Abdel Hafiz Ghoga, deputy chairman of Libya's National Transitional Council, the country's opposition body, said Wednesday night that international delegates had agreed to make the funds available. Ghoga said more than $100 billion in regime funds would be unfrozen and made available to the opposition, though he did not say which country or countries would release the funds, or when. He also said rebels requested that NATO intensify its airstrikes and protection of the civilian population. The funding decision came amid a grim assessment of the humanitarian fallout from the Libyan conflict and reports of mounting civilian casualties. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the delegates that in a worst-case scenario, as many as 3.6 million strife-affected people could eventually require help, and that the money to provide that help has been slow in coming. So far the United Nations has seen only 39% of the $310 million it requested in emergency funding, ""clearly insufficient given the prospective need,"" Ban said. ""It is critical that the international community act in concert, that we speak with one voice, and that we continue to work in common cause on behalf of the Libyan people,"" he said. The international delegates were meeting with Libyan opposition leaders in an attempt to work out a peaceful end to the deadly impasse in the North African nation. Despite a NATO-led aerial campaign and rebels fighting on the ground, leader Moammar Gadhafi has shown no signs of acquiescing. Among the high-profile attendees in Doha is Gadhafi's former intelligence chief and foreign minister, Moussa Koussa, who fled to Britain last month. Ghoga said Koussa was not invited to any of the meetings, however. ""Nobody from the National Transitional Council even considered meeting up with him,"" Ghoga said. ""It is our belief that Moussa Koussa was seeking to get residency in Doha, or future residency."" Rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah had said the opposition was open to meeting with Koussa if he first made clear, in writing, what he has to offer. The Libyan Contact Group was formed after a London conference on Libya last month. The first meeting in Doha comes as civilian casualties continued to mount. The besieged western city of Misrata has been especially vulnerable. Gadhafi's tanks have been pounding the city, where several more people were killed Wednesday, Abdulmolah said. Tuesday, a doctor told CNN, at least 10 people were killed and 30 were wounded. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that Gadhafi's forces have reportedly destroyed crucial food supply warehouses in Misrata and cut off water and power to the city ""in an apparent attempt to starve (residents) into submission."" Snipers have targeted Misrata residents seeking medical attention, she said. A military official said on state-run television that NATO ""airstrikes hit Misrata's main road of Tripoli Street, resulting in civilian casualties."" The official said the towns of al-Sbai'ah, Aziziyah and Sirte were also hit by ""the colonial crusader enemy."" U.S. fighter jets have continued to fly bombing missions in the NATO-led campaign, Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said Wednesday, although U.S. officials had previously indicated in public comments that the U.S. mission had become limited to providing support, including refueling and electronic jamming. Lapan said the U.S. aircraft assigned to NATO are ordered to defend the pilots who are enforcing the no-fly zone, and nothing more. NATO, he said, must still request U.S. strike aircraft should they want them for offensive operations. British Foreign Secretary William Hague and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe both called Tuesday for NATO to get more aggressive with the airstrikes in Libya, and opposition members urged the international community to implement the U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for ""all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack."" Libyan National Transitional Council member Ali Issawi said the rebels should be supported with military supplies. He said the Libyan people ought to have the right to defend themselves. Ghoga said the opposition has submitted a wish list of military equipment to Qatar and France. He said the list was compiled by rebel military leaders, but he didn't know exactly what was being requested. ""I don't think there's going to be a problem in getting military equipment in,"" Ghoga said. Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, a co-chair of Wednesday's meeting, said the opposition's international allies will consider the needs. ""Of course we will look at it and make things available for the Libyan people to defend themselves,"" he said. Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim accused Qatar late Wednesday of providing rebels in eastern Libya with Milan anti-tank warheads, but he did not say when. There was no immediate response from the Qatari government. A week ago, a CNN team in eastern Libya saw the rebels with Milan anti-tank missiles, which they didn't have before. Fighters said they obtained the missiles from the transitional government in Benghazi but didn't know where they came from. MBDA, the multinational missile manufacturer that makes the Milan missile, says it is in service in 43 countries around the world. It does not list those countries, but the military analysis site GlobalSecurity.org says the Milan missiles are used by the Qatari armed forces. ""The message to Gadhafi is clear,"" the Qatari prime minister said. ""He should use his head and those who are around him should advise him that it is in the interest of Libya, and if he is interested in Libya, then he should relinquish power and leave the Libyan people to decide their own destiny."" Hague said arming the rebels would not necessarily mean violating an arms embargo imposed on Libya. ""We understand the resolutions to mean the arms embargo applies to the whole of Libya, but that in certain circumstances it is possible, consistent with those resolutions, to provide people with the means to defend the civilian population,"" he said. The Doha meeting follows an effort earlier this week by the African Union to forge a peace plan that had been accepted in principle by Gadhafi. Ghoga and fellow rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil rejected it on grounds that it did not provide any solutions to violence against the Libyan people. Meanwhile in Germany, the foreign ministry said it had summoned the Libyan ambassador to inform him of the expulsion of five Libyan diplomats. They will have to leave Germany within seven days because of accusations that they intimidated Libyan citizens in Germany.

"(CNN) -- American veteran John Daly tamed ""brutal"" sandstorm conditions in Qatar to record a five-under-par round and sit one shot behind leader Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano. Daly, who was playing his first tournament after a near six-week break from the game, battled strong gusts and swirling sand in Doha to shoot a bogey-free round of 67. The 55-year-old, who can boast two major titles, no longer holds a U.S. PGA Tour card, but made light of the tough conditions. ""I'm pretty shocked,"" he told the European Tour's official website. ""I had five-and-a -half weeks off and really didn't touch a club much. Obama and golf: Par for the course for presidents . ""It's one of the best rounds I've ever played in a wind like that. You feel like you are eating a lot of sand."" The only man who had a better day than 1995 British Open winner Daly was Fernandez-Castano who recorded nine birdies alongside three bogeys. ""I would have taken level par,"" said Fernandez-Castano, who missed nearly six months of action last year due to a back injury. ""We couldn't see the ball landing on the fairways and I just tried to keep it as low as possible. I think I just got lucky and holed some important putts. Putting is the most difficult thing on a windy day."" Australian Jason Day and K.J.

Westwood took to social-networking site Twitter after his opening round to complain about slow play on day one. He said: ""To say we are pros and there's no rough out there and we are supposed to know what we are doing, the pace of play today was a disgrace."" He later added: ""I was referring to the general speed of play nearly every week now not any one person in particular.

"(CNN) -- The chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party died Wednesday, about four hours after a shooting at the party's headquarters, police said. Police block off the streets surrounding the state Democratic Party headquarters Wednesday in Little Rock. Chairman Bill Gwatney died at 3:59 Wednesday afternoon after a gunman entered his Little Rock office and shot him several times in the upper body, Little Rock Police Lt. Terry Hastings said. Authorities confirmed the news shortly after former President Clinton and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton released a statement expressing their condolences. ""We are deeply saddened by the news that Bill Gwatney has passed away,"" the former governor and first lady of Arkansas said. ""His leadership and commitment to Arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him."" The shooting suspect, a white male in his fifties, also died Wednesday afternoon after a police chase ended in gunfire, Hastings said. Authorities are working to confirm his identity, but Hastings said there was no indication that he was a former employee. He said police were investigating possible motives, as well as why the suspect went into the Arkansas Baptist State Convention brandishing a gun. CNN affilliates KARK and KTHV identified the gunman as Timothy Dale Johnson, 50, of Searcy, Arkansas. The suspect walked into the downtown headquarters, near the state Capitol building, before noon. The gunman said he was interested in volunteering, said Sam Higginbotham, a 17-year-old volunteer at the headquarters, The Associated Press reported. ""That was obviously a lie,"" Higginbotham said, the AP reported. The man asked for Gwatney and spoke with another employee before pushing his way into his office and pulling a gun on Gwatney, Hastings said. A woman in a nearby business told KTHV that Gwatney's assistant came in and asked her to call police.  Watch witnesses describe the incident » . ""I thought maybe someone had gotten hit by a car,"" said Sarah Lee, who works at a florist's shop. ""She was just shaking really bad."" But then the woman said that Gwatney had been shot and that three shots had been fired, Lee said. After the shooting, the suspect entered a nearby Arkansas Baptist State Convention and pointed a gun at an employee. The man was ""white as a sheet,"" convention official Dan Jordan said. ""I've heard he said something do to about losing a job. ... He didn't threaten anyone."" The man left through the front door shortly afterward, he said. A vehicle description was provided to police, Hastings said, and officers found it. A chase involving Little Rock police, Arkansas State Police and the Grant County Sheriff's Office ended about 20 miles south of Little Rock, where the suspect was shot and taken into custody, he said.  See a map of where the suspect was shot » . Police said the suspect drove into a ditch and around a set of spike strips in an attempt to evade police. Grant County authorities used a squad car to hit the suspect's vehicle from behind and ram it into another unit. The man then got out of his vehicle and began shooting at officers, who returned fire. In Sheridan, Arkansas, where the chase ended, a crowd gathered near the suspect's blue pickup as police cordoned off the area with yellow crime-scene tape. What appeared to be bullet holes could be seen in the truck's windshield. Police did not confirm Gwatney's identity until he died, but the Clintons released a statement earlier Wednesday that suggested Gwatney was involved. ""We are stunned and shaken by today's shooting at the Arkansas Democratic Party where our good friend and fellow Democrat Bill Gwatney was critically wounded,"" they said. ""Bill is not only a strong chairman of Arkansas' Democratic Party, but he is also a cherished friend and confidante. Our thoughts and prayers are with Bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery,"" they said. The Democratic National Committee also issued a statement Wednesday that identified Gwatney. ""This senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us,"" Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said in a written statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to Chairman Gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery.""

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy has never played in a World Match Play semifinal before, and he has never been ranked No. 1. Lee Westwood lost his top spot at the World Golf Championship event in Arizona a year ago, and he wants it back. Before this week the Englishman had never made it past the second round of the 64-man tournament in 11 attempts. Ideally they would be meeting in Sunday's 18-hole final in a showdown to see who will depose Luke Donald as golf's top dog, but instead they will have to clash in the semi. The winner of that morning match will play either Hunter Mahan or Mark Wilson, with the U.S. assured of a shot at the trophy for the first time since Tiger Woods took it home for the third occasion in 2008. ""I think it's the match that most people wanted and definitely the match that I wanted,"" world No. 2 McIlroy told reporters after beating South Korea's Bae Sang-moon 3&2 in his quarterfinal on Saturday. ""I'm excited about tomorrow, it should be a lot of fun and very exciting for everyone involved. ""All I need to do is focus on the match tomorrow morning, and then I think the biggest task for both of us, me and Lee, is getting yourself so much up for the semifinal. ""You have to get yourself up for that again. So that will be the tough task because obviously both of us feel you've got to get past each other -- for Lee to get back to number one and me to get there for the first time. ""You have to put your all into that and then whoever wins tomorrow morning, you get yourself back up again to go back out tomorrow afternoon and win the whole thing."" While McIlroy has already won the U.S. Open at the age of 22, the 38-year-old Westwood is still waiting for his first major victory -- though he has topped the European Tour money list and ended Woods' record-breaking run at the top of the rankings in 2010. ""We've played a lot together. It will be a good match -- I hope it will be a great match, that we both play well and make a lot of birdies,"" Westwood said of the clash with his European Ryder Cup teammate after his 4&2 victory over Scotland's Martin Laird. ""My priorities were to win major championships and win World Golf Championships because I haven't ever won any. I've been at No. 1 a couple of times. It would be a different way of thinking to me compared to Rory, who hasn't been No. 1. He may be thinking about it, but my main goal is to play well or play as well as I've been playing tomorrow morning and try and win that match."" Neither Mahan nor Wilson are ranked inside the top 20, but have both been in fine form at the Ritz-Carlton course this week. World No. 22 Mahan went through after thrashing U.S. Ryder Cup teammate Matt Kuchar 6&5 in the shortest quarterfinal since the tournament started in 1999. ""Matt couldn't find the putter today, which is rare for him, because he's a great putter,"" Mahan said of his 14th-ranked opponent. ""I got lucky in that aspect. But I played solid, didn't make any bogeys and didn't give many holes -- and kept the pressure on him. That was nice to do."" Wilson, ranked 42nd and a three-time winner on the PGA Tour, cruised past Sweden's Peter Hanson 4&3, and has yet to play past the 16th hole this week. ""I don't think too many people picked me to win,"" said Wilson, who is looking to follow in the example of last year's winner Donald and his predecessor Ian Poulter -- none of the trio are long hitters.","World No.2 Rory McIlroy to play third-ranked Lee Westwood in World Match Play semifinals .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Few things could have created more of a media frenzy over Italian football than the David Beckham loan saga between AC Milan and the Los Angeles Galaxy. Italian football fans show their passion for the game. This protracted storyline and the subsequent fallout from it saw readership boom on the SerieATalk.com blog -- our blog of the month. Set up by Christopher Harris in 2007, the blog has become a full-time job for the 39-year-old American. Harris told CNN that he has a strong interest in the Italian football scene, and with a background working in web design and marketing, that motivated him to set up his own site. ""I created it a couple of years ago -- really with the rise in popularity of Serie A. It has continued to grow, and this year the Beckham story was a large factor in that."" Harris said the rise of Italian football has helped his U.S. based blog flourish since he created it. Read the Serie A Talk blog . Rebounding from the lows of the match-fixing scandal in 2006 -- a World Cup win for the Azzurri and the arrival of top players like Kaka and Ronaldinho has seen Italy's Serie A competition once again become a force in world football. Even today there's no shortage of issues to talk about. With Inter Milan currently storming to the Serie A title, the ongoing David Beckham road-show, and the failure of the Italian clubs in the Champions League -- there's been plenty to discuss and debate on the SerieAtalk blog. Harris said there is plenty of television access to Italian football matches in the U.S. and therefore there was already a base of interest on that side of the Atlantic before he began the blog. The major goal of the blog is to present a unique perspective on some of the issues affecting the Italian game, he said. ""It's a collaboration between several writers around the world. From time to time I write ... but mainly I manage the site. ""Some of our work is talking about the media coverage of the league and looking at the big issues in a unique way,"" Harris said. He said he tried to present the blog in an objective way, rather than supporting a particular club. ""I try to remain neutral and be more of an observer of the league itself.""

"(CNN) -- Bill Haas should have spent Sunday celebrating a friend's wedding. Instead he was toasting a fourth PGA Tour title after beating major champions Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley in a playoff to clinch the Northern Trust Open. Haas, the 2011 FedEx Cup series victor, looked to have won the California tournament outright after shooting two-under-par 69 in his final round. But the new world No. 12 was pegged back after Mickelson, who was looking to secure back-to-back tour wins, and 2011 PGA Championship winner Bradley both birdied the par-four 18th to join him on seven under. Haas eventually sealed victory with a 45-foot putt on the second additional hole, having earlier overhauled a two-stroke deficit on third-round leaders Mickelson and Bradley. ""I'm sure I'll talk to him later and hopefully his day is even better than mine,"" the 29-year-old Haas told the PGA Tour's official website when asked about missing friend Jon Hopson's big day. ""It's pretty sweet for both of us today. ""I never expected to make a 40-footer, especially in that situation. A little luck was involved. I guess it was meant to be."" It wasn't just Haas who was surprised to see his effort find the cup, with both Mickelson and Bradley expecting him to come up short. ""Bill hit a tremendous putt,"" the 41-year-old Mickelson said. ""We're thinking it's a very difficult three. It's a defensive hole. You're just trying to make four, believe it or not."" The 25-year-old Bradley added: ""I didn't think he was going to make that one. I should have known, though, because he's a great putter and a great player."" The victory means has Haas won a PGA Tour title three years in a row, and moved him up to fifth in the early-season FedEx Cup standings. Haas was battling a partisan crowd at the Riviera Country Club, with onlookers lending their backing to California native Mickelson -- a two-time winner of the event who was on a roll after clinching the AT&T National Pro-Am seven days before. ""Honestly 'Phil' sounds really similar to 'Bill,' so you just kind of pretend that maybe they're for you,"" said Haas. ""If I'm at home, I'm cheering for Phil."" Former world No. 2 Sergio Garcia carded a stunning 64 to finish tied for fourth on five under, level with 10th-ranked Dustin Johnson (71), his fellow American Jimmy Walker (69) and New Zealand's Jarrod Lyle (70). American trio Bo van Pelt (70), J.B. Holmes (70) -- who is back this year after brain surgery -- and Jonathan Byrd (73) were tied for eighth on four under. Australian world No. 8 Adam Scott (70) was part of a seven-way tie for 17th which also included 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson (72) and last month's Farmers Insurance Open winner Brandt Snedeker (70). British world No. 1 Luke Donald endured a torrid final round and carded eight bogeys on his way to a 78 which saw him finish seven over.","Bill Haas holes a 45-foot putt to seal a playoff win at the Northern Trust Open .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of residents ordered out of their homes as a massive wildfire advanced on the suburbs of Fort Collins, Colorado, may be allowed to return Wednesday evening, fire officials said. ""We're gaining,"" said Bill Hahnenberg, the U.S. Forest Service's commander for the team battling the High Park wildfire, which has burned 46,600 acres in northern Colorado. The fire, which has claimed at least one life, is estimated to be 10% contained. About 100 structures are confirmed lost, but hundreds of families are anxiously waiting to hear whether their homes survived. ""This fire's behavior is starting to diminish, at least in some places, where we can have trained individuals to go in and determine which structures are lost,"" Hahnenberg said during his Wednesday morning media briefing. Hundreds of firefighters have arrived from around the United States to help local departments that have been battling the fire, bringing to 1,000 the number of personnel involved in the fight. The local firefighters, some of whom have lost their own homes, are tired, Hahnenberg said. ""We're doing our best and have enough resources on board to rotate in and relieve them."" They've had ""some success, some failure"" in containing the advance of flames eastward and southward, toward residential areas, he said. Residents should be able to return to two evacuated neighborhoods later Wednesday and perhaps three areas Thursday, said Nick Christensen of the Larimer County Sheriff's Department. Mark Engle's family decided not to leave their Colorado home despite the thick smoke billowing through the air outside Tuesday. From a window, he watched deer grazing in his backyard, driven out of the forest by flames that have devoured thousands of acres of land only a few miles away. His children's backpacks were placed by the door, stuffed with their favorite toys. His family was packed and ready to leave in a hurry, Engle said. But they wanted to stay put, even though authorities have ordered residents in the area to clear out. ""There's a number of people like myself, (for whom) packing up and leaving when you have livestock and animals just isn't as easy as if you have just a house,"" Engle said. First measured at two acres early Saturday, the High Park Fire -- which officials say was caused by lightning -- has grown exponentially in the time since. President Barack Obama telephoned Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper on Tuesday and said his administration is already making personnel, equipment and federal grants available to the state to help in the effort. The huge plumes of smoke from the High Park fire are visible from miles away, casting a somber shadow even over communities well outside the danger zone. CNN iReporter Dave Thrush, a musician from Denver, posted dramatic pictures of smoke darkening the skies above the Colorado State University campus Sunday. ""The fire is 20 miles from the campus, so no one is in danger there, but the billowing smoke is still very eerie,"" he wrote. Another CNN iReporter, goodline69, a restaurant server in Lafayette, Colorado, told CNN on Monday: ""It was a beautiful day in Fort Collins with business as usual for many, it seemed, so it was a bit surreal to be watching homes being destroyed from across the reservoir. ""I found myself watching the crowd watch the fire. Heartbreaking."" Are wildfires near you?

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods is looking to the familiarity of home as he continues his search for a first full-field tournament win in over two years. The former world No. 1 has announced he will play three PGA Tour events in the next month, including the Honda Classic in Florida for the first time in his professional career. The tournament is held in Palm Beach Gardens, which is near the 14-time major champion's home on Jupiter Island -- where he moved last year after his 2010 breakup with ex-wife Elin Nordegren following the scandal about his extramarital affairs. ""I've heard great things about the Honda Classic,"" Woods told his website. ""Now that I live there, I want to play whenever possible."" He missed the cut as a 17-year-old amateur in 1993 when the tournament -- which since 2007 has benefited the children's charity of golf legend Jack Nicklaus -- was played at the Weston Hills course. ""Jack's involvement in the tournament and the benefits to the local community are also important,"" Woods said of the March 1-4 event. Its current venue, the PGA National, is rated as one of the toughest courses on the U.S. circuit. ""We obviously are thrilled to have Tiger Woods play,"" tournament director Ken Kennerly told the tour's website. ""We have worked hard for five years to make this one of the premier events on the PGA Tour. ""This is a testament to where the tournament has come, and a testament to Honda's 31 years as the longest-standing sponsor on the PGA Tour.""

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 1 Tiger Woods is confident he is returning to top form ahead of his first PGA Tour appearance of 2012 at Pebble Beach this week.

But Woods has shown signs of improvement in recent months, winning the Chevron World Challenge event he hosts in December and finishing tied for third at last weekend's Abu Dhabi Golf Championship.

Woods entered the final round of last week's European Tour event tied for the lead with eventual winner Robert Rock, but found only two fairways over the last 18 holes and finished two shots behind the Englishman. Despite missing out on victory, Woods was encouraged by his performance in the Gulf. ""That was my bad day and it wasn't that bad. I know the stats show I only hit two fairways, but I landed the ball on eight and ran through it,"" he said. ""My stats said I hit six greens, but I putted from off the green four times so that's 10 greens. If I can have that as my bad ball-striking day, we're looking pretty good."" Woods has won a total of 71 PGA Tour events since turning pro in 1996 -- only the legendary duo of Jack Nicklaus with 73 and the late Sam Snead on 82 have claimed more. Now ranked 18th after falling outside the top 50 last year, he admits that practicing and preparing for tournaments gets harder the older he gets. ""The more we age, the more time we need to heal,"" he said. ""I don't recover quite as well. ""I know that I'm sore quite often, just about every day when I'm playing with my kids.

"(CNN) -- In a landmark ruling, an international tribunal found former Liberian President Charles Taylor guilty Thursday of aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone's notoriously brutal civil war. It was the first war crimes conviction of a former head of state by an international court since the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders after World War II. Prosecutors, however, failed to prove that Taylor had direct command over the rebels who committed the atrocities, said Justice Richard Lussick of the Special Court for Sierra Leone. A three-judge panel issued a unanimous decision that Taylor, 64, was guilty on all 11 counts of the indictment against him. The judges found him guilty of aiding and abetting rebel forces in a campaign of terror that involved murder, rape, sexual slavery, conscripting children younger than 15 and mining diamonds to pay for guns. Prosecutor Brenda Hollis hailed the verdict as a milestone in accountability and said it ""made clear the central role Charles Taylor played in the horrific crimes against the people of Sierra Leone. ""This judgment affirms that with leadership comes not just power and authority, but also responsibility and accountability,"" she said. ""No person, no matter how powerful, is above the law."" Taylor will learn what penalty he'll be forced to pay on May 30, two weeks after a hearing to argue the most appropriate terms of his sentence. There is no death penalty in international criminal law, and Taylor would serve out any sentence in a British prison. Taylor's lawyer, Courtenay Griffiths, suggested the trial was politically motivated. He claimed his client's conviction was ""obtained on tainted and corrupted evidence"" based on the testimony of witnesses from Sierra Leone who were paid to appear in court. Griffiths portrayed Taylor as a legitimate leader who aided rebels in a neighboring nation. Those rebels, not Taylor himself, should be held accountable for their actions, the lawyer contended. ""If such behavior is to be deemed illegal, then I'd like to see it be deemed illegal across the board,"" Griffiths said, referring to leaders of the United States or Britain potentially paying the price for crimes committed by covert groups they have supported. ""But let's be frank, ladies and gentlemen,"" Griffiths said, ""do you honestly see that ever happening?"" Throughout Lussick's reading of a long list of chilling crimes, Taylor remained stoic. Dressed in a charcoal gray suit, a white shirt and a burgundy tie, the former warlord stood quietly as the judge delivered the guilty verdict. The mood was decidedly different in Freetown, the Sierra Leone capital, where, as one resident described it, every television set was on. ""Relief. Relief,"" said Jennifer Harold, national director of the charity World Vision. ""Everybody is thrilled."" Harold said Taylor's conviction was a big psychological victory for his victims. ""People can be very cynical about justice,"" she said. ""But now you have someone finally getting caught, finally getting justice."" U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay noted that Taylor can appeal the verdict, and it could be overturned. That said, she called his conviction ""immensely significant,"" saying it sends out a message that even the most powerful are not above the law. ""This is undoubtedly a historic moment in the development of international justice,"" she said. ""A former president, who once wielded immense influence in a neighboring country where tens of thousands of people were killed, mutilated, raped, robbed and repeatedly displaced for years on end, has been arrested, tried in a fair and thorough international procedure."" Taylor has been a pivotal figure in Liberian politics for decades after he overthrew the regime of Samuel Doe in 1989, plunging the country into a bloody civil war that left 200,000 dead over the next 14 years. After he was forced out of office under international pressure in 2003, he lived in exile in Nigeria, where border guards arrested him in 2006 as he was attempting to cross into Chad amid international pressure. That culminated in his trial, which began in 2007 at the special court for Sierra Leone in The Hague, Netherlands. U.N. officials and the Sierra Leone government jointly set up the tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities. The court was moved from Sierra Leone, where emotions about the civil war still run high. Judges ultimately heard testimony from more than 100 people in the case. They included supermodel Naomi Campbell, who told the special tribunal that she received ""dirty-looking stones"" she assumed were gifts from Taylor after a dinner hosted by then-South African President Nelson Mandela in 1997. The prosecution was trying, with her testimony, to tie Taylor to ""blood diamonds"" -- the mining and selling of diamonds, in this case to fund rebels in several African conflict areas. ""When I was sleeping, I had a knock on my door. I opened the door and two men were there. They gave me a pouch and said, 'A gift for you,'"" she said. ""The men didn't introduce themselves or say anything else."" Prosecutors accused Taylor of financing and giving orders to Revolutionary United Front rebels in Sierra Leone's civil war that ultimately left 50,000 dead or missing. His support for the rebels fueled the bloody war, prosecutors said. Fighters included teenagers forced to kill, rape and plunder placed under the influence of drugs to provoke violent behavior. Witnesses testified about grisly violence by the rebels during the conflict, including shooting and disemboweling pregnant women and children. Sometimes, rebels asked people if they wanted long sleeves or short sleeves. The former meant hacking off hands; the latter, forearms. ""Brave men, women and children have taken the stand against Charles Taylor,"" the prosecutor's office said in a written statement. ""They have included amputees, rape victims, former child soldiers and persons enslaved, robbed, and terrorized. We are awed by their courage."" Ishmael Beah, a former rebel child soldier in Sierra Leone who has written a book chronicling his experiences, said the verdict gives people in his native country good reason to celebrate Friday, on its independence day. ""I feel very happy today that such a man is no longer powerful and that the law has prevailed,"" Beah told CNN. ""It shows that nobody can get away with doing such things, particularly with recruiting children in war."" Taylor becomes the first former head of state since Adm. Karl Doenitz, who became president of Germany briefly after Adolf Hitler's suicide, to be convicted for war crimes or crimes against humanity by an international tribunal. Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was tried by an international tribunal but died before a judgment was issued. The International Criminal Court has charged Laurent Gbagbo, the former Ivory Coast president, with crimes against humanity. It also has a warrant out for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who, so far, has been able to elude arrest. ""Powerful leaders like Charles Taylor have for too long lived comfortably above the law,"" said Elise Keppler, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch. ""Taylor's conviction sends a message to those in power that they can be held to account for grave crimes."" The White House cheered Thursday's verdict, releasing a statement pointing to ""progress"" that has been made in Sierra Leone and Liberia and saying it hoped the ruling ""will help dissuade others who might follow in his footsteps."" William Hague, Britain's foreign minister, was even more pointed in his comments. On Twitter, he urged Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- who many have claimed has ordered troops to clamp down on civilian dissenters, killing thousands -- to pay attention to what happened at the Hague, lest he also someday faces charges. ""Justice has been done. Remember his victims, & remind #Assad: there is no expiry date for crimes against the innocent,"" Hague said.","NEW: UK foreign minister says verdict should be lesson to Syria's al-Assad .

"(CNN) -- One week ago, Kyle Stanley was reduced to tears after a heartbreaking collapse saw him surrender a seven-shot lead in the final round of the Farmers Insurance Open. On Sunday, the American was once again in tears. But this time they were tears of joy after Stanley benefited from a similarly dramatic meltdown from Spencer Levin to seal a one-stroke win at the Waste Management Open in Phoenix, Arizona. Stanley carded a six-under-par 65 in the final round to finish 15 under for the tournament, while Levin blew a six-shot overnight lead by hitting a four-over 75. ""I think the biggest challenge was seeing if I could put last week behind me,"" Stanley told the PGA Tour's official website after picking up his first professional win. Why golf (and big business) still needs Tiger . ""I think I did. You go from a very low point to a high point. I'm not sure I expected to maybe recover this quickly."" Stanley said his experience at Torrey Pines -- where he triple-bogeyed the 18th and missed a five-foot putt in a playoff against eventual winner Brandt Snedeker -- made his triumph all the better. ""I'm never going to forget that,"" he said of his nightmare final round said. ""But I think it makes this one a lot sweeter, just being able to bounce back. ""I'm kind of at a loss for words. I'm very grateful for the support I've gotten. It's unbelievable. Unbelievable turnaround."" Levin's horrible round was compounded by a disastrous sequence of events at the par-five 15th, where his drive found a cactus patch before he hit his third shot into the water. ""It just wasn't my day, obviously,"" said Levin, who is still looking for his first Tour victory. ""But I gave it away, simple as that. You have a six-shot lead and lose, you gave it away. ""My hat's off to Kyle. He played a great round. He went and got it. But if you've got a six-shot lead and don't win, then I think it's on the player with the lead, for sure."" Stanley took home a check for $1.098 million and moved to the top of the early-season FedEx Cup standings. Ben Crane (66) finished the weekend in second on 14 under, with Levin third on 13 under and D.J. Trahan on 12 under after a 66. World No. 19 Bubba Watson (70) was tied for fifth on 11 under alongside fellow Americans Brendan Steele (64) and Kevin Na (65). Keegan Bradley, the 2011 PGA Championship winner, was in a four-way tie for 15th after a four-under 67, with 2010 PGA Tour rookie of the year Rickie Fowler -- ranked 37th in the world -- carding a 69 to finish on six under in a six-way tie for 26th. Snedeker tied for 50th on two under after a 68.","American golfer Kyle Stanley wins first professional title at the Phoenix Open .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Supreme Court on Thursday convicted Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani of contempt of court but gave him just a symbolic sentence that will not require him to serve time in prison. The court found Gilani guilty of the contempt charge after his repeated refusals to ask Swiss authorities to revive old corruption charges against the country's president, Asif Ali Zardari. That makes him the first sitting Pakistani prime minister to be convicted of a crime. But the court sentenced him only for the duration of the hearing, which lasted several minutes. He could have faced as much as six months in jail. An opposition leader said Gilani should resign following the guilty verdict, but members of the prime minister's cabinet insisted he would continue in his role and appeal the decision. The conviction means Gilani could be disqualified as prime minister, but that's a process that could take up to four months. ""I think that after the conviction the prime minister should immediately step down from his post,"" Nawaz Sharif, a prominent opposition leader, said on Geo TV. By remaining in power, Gilani risks harming the credibility of parliament, Sharif said. But members of Gilani's government criticized the court's decision as being politically motivated. ""The verdict is unconstitutional and immoral,"" Nazar Muhammad Gondal, the federal minister for capital administration and development, said on Express News, a local channel. ""The prime minister has the confidence of the parliament, so he will continue as the prime minister,"" he said. Imtiaz Safdar Warraich, the deputy interior minister, said the government planned to appeal against the verdict. Gilani was convicted for ""willful flouting, disregard and disobedience of this court's direction,"" said Justice Nasir ul-Mulk as he read out the decision. The judge said that ""the contempt committed by him is substantially detrimental to the administration of justice and tends to bring this court and the judiciary of this country into ridicule."" Gilani's lawyers argued that the prime minister had not followed the court's order to press for the reopening of the charges because Zardari enjoys immunity in Pakistan and abroad as a president in office. Most observers had expected that a conviction would come without a prison sentence. ""They donÂ¹t want to make a spectacle out of it,"" the columnist and analyst Muhammad Malick said earlier this week. ""A prison sentence would create an unnecessary political drama."" ""Time in prison would create a wave of sympathy for the prime minister, and that's something the judges don't want to see,"" said author and political analyst Imtiaz Gul. This is not the first time Gilani has fallen foul of Pakistan's legal system. He served more than five years in prison between 2001 and 2006 on corruption charges brought by the previous military regime of Gen. Pervez Musharraf -- counts he said were also politically motivated. The corruption cases that the Supreme Court now wants reopened stem from money-laundering charges against Zardari and his late wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. A Swiss court convicted them in absentia in 2003 of laundering millions of dollars. After Musharraf granted a controversial amnesty in 2007 to Zardari, Bhutto, and thousands of other politicians and bureaucrats, Pakistan asked the Swiss authorities to drop the case. In 2009, the Pakistani Supreme Court ruled the amnesty was unconstitutional and called on the government to take steps to have the cases reopened. The government did not do so, and the court lost patience. Since Gilani is the head of the government, the court justices view him as responsible. CNN's Shaan Khan and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Opposition leader calls for the prime minister to resign .

"(CNN) -- A North Carolina poultry company is recalling approximately 4,000 pounds of cooked chicken breasts that may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Friday that the House of Raeford Farms, based in Rose Hill, North Carolina, recalled 18- to 22-pound boxes containing two 9- to 11-pound ""boneless oven roasted chicken breasts"" per box. Consumers should look for serial number ""P-239A"" inside the USDA mark of inspection, along with a product code of ""94268"" and a package date of ""1270"" (September 27, 2011). The products were shipped to delicatessens and food service institutions for further processing in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, according to a USDA press release. The problem was discovered after a customer's laboratory sample of the chicken tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes, according to the USDA statement. Neither the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have received any reports of illness due to consumption of these products. Listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, an uncommon but potentially fatal disease. It is rarely found in healthy people. However, it can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea. In extreme cases, listeriosis can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths, as well as serious and sometimes fatal infections, especially in people with poor immune systems. Anyone concerned about being sick should contact a health care provider, the USDA said. According to the USDA, the best way to avoid listeriosis is to wash your hands with warm, soapy water before and after handling raw meat or poultry. Also wash cutting boards, utensils and dishes with hot, soapy water. Using separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, vegetables and egg products also prevents cross-contamination.","The cooked chicken breasts may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes .

"(CNN) -- Thousands on Saturday fled the area in southwestern Ivory Coast where attacks left seven U.N. peacekeepers and eight civilians dead, according to a U.N. official. One attack occurred late Thursday and into Friday near Para Village, not far from the west-central African nation's border with Liberia, according to the United Nations. Humanitarian organizations reported Saturday they were expecting about 4,000 people in Tai, said Remi Dourlot, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Several hundred had arrived by midday Saturday in the town, which is on the edge of Tai National Park. Another 35 families crossed the Ivory Coast's southwest border into U.N. refugee camps in Liberia, and humanitarian groups said hundreds of others had been pushed south by the violence, according to Dourlot. The movement comes after blue-helmeted peacekeepers -- who were in the area because of threats against civilians -- came under attack, the United Nations said in a statement. Besides the U.N. peacekeepers, humanitarian groups reported eight civilians died in violence, said Dourlot. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Friday called on the government of Ivory Coast ""to do its utmost to identify the perpetrators and hold them accountable."" He added that he understood other peacekeepers remained in danger. ""Even tonight, after the attack, more than 40 peacekeepers remain with the villagers in this remote region to protect them from this armed group,"" Ban said. U.N. Operation in Cote d'Ivoire and Ivory Coast troops have increased their presence in the area, Dourlot said Saturday. Members of the U.N. humanitarian affairs office have deployed to Tai to coordinate relief efforts there with local authorities. Clinton urges Ivory Coast dialogue . A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission in Ivory Coast said Friday's incident was the first attack on peacekeepers since they entered the country in 2004. Sylvie van den Wildenberg, in a telephone interview from her office in Abidjan, said the remaining forces were continuing to protect area residents, ""who are living in a very difficult terrain -- their villages scattered."" Van den Wildenberg said it was not clear who was responsible for the attack, which occurred mid-afternoon. ""This is an area where you have so many different types of armed people,"" she said. ""People have different aims and different reasons to carry arms and to perpetrate attack. So this is a very complex environment. We can't extrapolate. We just can't fingerpoint any group."" The peacekeepers were on a reconnaissance patrol because U.N. officials had heard rumors several days earlier of armed men in the area threatening to attack a village, she said. U.N. peacekeepers remained in Ivory Coast after the 2010 presidential election, when the country was thrown into crisis after incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo refused to acknowledge defeat to former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara. The latter was sworn in on May 21. Gbagbo is in custody at the Hague, accused of crimes against humanity during post-election violence that killed thousands. According to the United Nations, its peacekeeping force in Ivory Coast as of April 30 included nearly 11,000 uniformed personnel, as well as several hundred international civilian personnel, local staff and volunteers. They provide technical, logistical and security support to the government. CNN's Christabelle Fombu and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","Humanitarian groups expect 4,000 refugees in one camp, a U.N. official says .

"(CNN) -- The Torkham border crossing in Pakistan was opened for NATO supply convoy traffic Sunday morning, authorities told CNN. Trucks are free to pass once they have cleared customs, said Amjad Ali, a constable for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Pakistan closed the main land route for NATO supplies crossing from Pakistan to Afghanistan after U.S. helicopter strikes across the border killed two Pakistani soldiers. A report from a NATO and Pakistan assessment team concluded that soldiers fired warning shots to let them know of their presence, but the helicopter crews assumed they were insurgents and fired the shots. While the main route has been closed, at least seven attacks on convoys carrying supplies for NATO forces in Afghanistan have taken place in Pakistan. The convoys are generally operated by contracted Pakistani firms, using Pakistani trucks and drivers. Since October 1, at least six people have been killed in attacks on supply vehicles. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for the most recent attack, which took place Saturday in Pakistan's western Baluchistan province. Assailants attacked 28 oil tankers with a machine gun and rockets, said Meeran Bukhsh, a police official in the Bolan district, said. Police said the tankers caught fire, and two people were injured. The attack was carried out by the Pakistani Taliban's special squad on U.S. assets in Pakistan -- particularly fuel trucks for NATO, Shakir Khan, the militants' spokesman said Saturday. The special squad was purportedly founded in response to increased U.S. drone strikes. ""We are very proud of the performance of this squad as they have been able to successfully target NATO convoys all over Pakistan,"" Khan said. A second supply route through Chaman in western Pakistan was open during the Torkham closure, but the Pakistani Taliban has threatened violence on any route used for NATO purposes.

"(CNN) -- Spain's Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano believes he can send former world number one Tiger Woods packing in this week's WGC Match Play tournament, as a high-class field arrives in Arizona vying for a winner's purse of a cool $1.4m. A high-class field sees 64 of the world's top 68 players battling it out at the Ritz-Carlton Club, Dove Mountain, with Woods the most successful player in the event's history having won the title three times since its inception in 1999. However, despite the American's ominous tournament record, world No.48 Fernandez-Castano is relishing the prospect of taking on the former world number one on Wednesday. The 31-year-old told the official PGA Tour website: ""It's a great opportunity for me because I think he's beatable. ""I need to play good. That's all I can think about and that's all I'm going to try on Wednesday, just try playing my best game and hope that he doesn't play his best."" Despite Woods' slide down the rankings in recent years, he is still ranked 20th in the world, meaning Fernandez-Castano would have to cause a major upset to progress to a last 32 clash against either Nick Watney or British Open champion Darren Clarke. ""I'm the underdog and I have nothing to lose, at the same time I don't think he is at his best at the moment,"" added Fernandez- Castano. ""I've never played with Tiger before and, for me, it's a big privilege. If I win, fantastic. If I lose, well, I've lost to one of the best players in golf's history.""

"(Mashable) -- Americans are going online to pass the time more than they were just a few years ago, according to a new study. A report from Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project found that about 53% of young adults ages 18 to 29 go online on any given day for no particular reason except for a diversion or just for fun. About 81% of people in this demographic said they have done so at least occasionally. The study -- conducted among 2,260 adults ages 18 and over on landlines and cellphones -- has a margin of error of 3.7%. But it's not just young web users that turn to the Internet during their down time -- about 58% of all adults or 74% of online adults said they use the Internet this way, up from 45% of adults who said they did so in a Pew survey conducted in 2006. Pew noted that the growth of people using the Internet as a ""destination for fun"" coincides with the rise of broadband connections, social networking and video. The trend also suggests that the Web is becoming a competitor to other kinds of other leisure activities. ""These findings are one of our main signs about how deeply Internet use has woven itself into the rhythms of people's lives,"" lead author Lee Rainie told Mashable. ""When they have some down time, more and more of them are finding the Internet a fun, diverting place to spend their leisure moments. It's not necessarily surprising to see that this is a favorite pastime of young adults. It is a bit surprising to see that the incidence of this use has grown in every age demographic.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan detained a senior Army officer for suspected connections to a militant organization, a military spokesman said Tuesday. Brig. Ali Khan, stationed at military headquarters in the garrison town of Rawalpindi for the past two years, has been in custody for the past two days over alleged links to the militant group Hizb ut-Tahrir, said spokesman Maj.

Khan's detainment comes as Pakistan's ties to the United States have been strained over strategy in combating terrorism. Lask week, Pakistan's intelligence agency detained several people who gave information to the United States before the raid in Abbottabad that killed Osama bin Laden. Washington has complained that Pakistan has not done enough to fight al Qaeda and other militants. Senior U.S. officials also suspect that some in Pakistan helped bin Laden live there.

"(CNN) -- The secret to Phil Mickelson's recent successes against longtime rival Tiger Woods could lie with the man who has coached both golf superstars -- Butch Harmon. Harmon helped Woods to eight of his 14 major triumphs between 1993 and 2004, and started working with Mickelson three years later. He was on hand to give the veteran left-hander tips during the pair's final-round showdown at Pebble Beach on Sunday. Mickelson bettered his fellow American for the fifth time in a row when they have played together on the last day of a tournament to clinch his 40th PGA Tour title. Harmon, who has also worked with other top names such as former major champions Greg Norman and Fred Couples, has revealed how he gave Mickelson an insight into what to expect from former world No. 1 Woods. Mickelson roars to victory as Tiger falls apart at Pebble Beach . ""I explained to Phil some things to be aware of when playing with Tiger,"" Harmon told the tour's official website. ""If Tiger putts out first the gallery is going to start moving ahead, so if you have a chance to putt out first it's in your best interest to do so. ""If it's close on the back nine, Tiger will sometimes hit three-wood on purpose to make you wait. Tiger's not doing anything illegal, it's just a little bit of gamesmanship."" While four-time major winner Mickelson carded a stunning eight-under-par 64 to surge up the leaderboard and win, Woods collapsed from third to tie for 15th after a 75. Tiger seeks 'home' success as he announces PGA Tour triple-header . But Mickelson took the time to praise Woods, who is currently enduring the longest winless run of his career having not claimed an official tournament victory since November 2009. ""I don't believe anybody has benefited more from what he's done for the game than myself,"" said Mickelson, who has outscored Woods on eight of the 12 occasions they have played together since he started working with Harmon in 2007. ""He seems to bring out the best in me and the last four or five years. I just seem more focused. "" Mickelson also spoke of the ""little bit of inspiration"" his wife Amy -- who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 -- had given him when it looked as if the tournament was slipping away on Friday. A pep talk from her helped him overhaul a six-shot deficit on leader Charlie Wi on Sunday. ""I think it's a good lesson for me to learn that if you never give up and you stay and you fight hard, you can fight through some bad stretches and still come out on top at the end of the week because you just never know when it'll turn,"" he said, before acknowledging his recent lack of form. The 41-year-old finished 26th at his previous outing in Phoenix, having missed the cut at Torrey Pines and tied for 49th in his season opener at the Humana Challenge in California. ""Prior to the Humana, I had played eight to 10 rounds like Sunday's final round, and I've been wondering where that has been these last three weeks,"" he said ahead of Thursday's opening round at the Northern Trust Open , where he tasted victory in 2008 and 2009. ""I was wondering what happened those three weeks because I had been playing well prior, and I'm just glad it finally came out when I needed it the most.""","Tiger Woods' ex-coach Butch Harmon gave Phil Mickelson tips on how to beat him .

"(CNN) -- I hate the holidays. Professionally speaking that is. This is the dangerous season when more family finances go off the rails than at any time of the year. From the opening gun on Black Friday through the last-minute grabs on Christmas Eve there seems to be a national moratorium on sound spending practices. That said, if you're expecting some finger-wagging lecture about not spending money on gifts this year, well, I hate to disappoint you, but that's not where I am headed. Gift-giving is part of our celebration ritual. And there's nothing wrong with that. All that I care about -- and what you should care about just as much -- is that your gift-giving shows respect. For yourself. That means crafting a gift-giving strategy that is affordable for you today. What you gave to someone last year, or the length of last-year's gift-giving list should be irrelevant. Yet we all know that there's this internal pressure to keep up appearances or traditions, even if your financial circumstances have changed. So even if you did a fabulous job the first 11 months of the year scaling back your spending so you could ramp up your retirement savings, or pay down your debts, there's a temptation to let those good habits get pushed to the back burner during this dangerous season. Here's how to make it through this holiday season with your financial integrity intact. Pay cash . I challenge you to not make one holiday gift purchase with a credit card. You can't have regrets in January if you limit your spending to money you actually have. The tab for unpaid credit card balances in the U.S. is $690 billion. It's one thing to run up a balance if your family is struggling to make ends meet -- and even that has obvious serious consequences--But there is just no excuse for running up any credit card debt for gifts. Period. The simplest way to keep your household on track is to put the credit cards away and use a debit card tied to a bank account. And don't you dare let the bank snooker you into accepting overdraft protection. That's just a temptation to allow yourself to slip and spend more than you have. The only one who really benefits is the bank; the average charge for an overdraft is $30. Prioritize . It takes a plan to make it through this season unscathed. Here's my three-step strategy: Set a spending limit, stick to a firm list of recipients and most important, no wavering from steps 1 and 2. Your spending limit is pretty simple: How much extra cash do you have handy? No dipping into savings (unless you in fact were smart and have a holiday savings account you've been socking money into throughout the year). No touching the emergency fund. No gift is an emergency. And no robbing Peter: No cheating by not making your Roth IRA deposit this month or skipping the kid's 529 College savings contribution to free up cash for presents. Next, decide who's on your list. Then divvy up your cash to each person: literally write down how much you intend to spend on each person. If the numbers don't add up, then you've got a few choices: Spend less on that person, spend less on someone else. Reduce the number of people on your list. Or get creative: Offer to babysit for the kids of harried friends or family. That's probably going to be worth a hell of a lot more than any monetary gift. Have a friend who keeps talking about tackling cleaning out their garage or fixing up a spare room? Okay, your gift is three weekends over the course of the year to serve as their sub-contractor and cheerleader. You get the idea: Before you spend a penny on gifts this season you need to have a formal plan from which you will not deviate. Don't get played . Retailers know we are suckers for anything that seems like a deal. So they try to play us for chumps. Instead of offering a $50 sweater for $50, they advertise that the sweater was $75 but they are going to let you steal it from them for $50. Woo-hoo, one-third off! And this works like a charm thanks to our anchoring habit. That's a term used by behavioral economists to describe how we get fixated on a number. In this case, we're anchored to the fact that the sweater is ""worth"" $75, so we feel like we're getting a great deal at $50. But is it really a deal? For starters, slow down and size up what you're buying. Does it seem worth it at $50? Quality matters. And most important, do you have the $50 to spend? The sales price doesn't matter if you were intending to spend $40 on this specific gift. It's still overpriced by 20 percent based on what you can truthfully afford. Standing in your truth is the most important gift to bestow this and every holiday season. It's not just about doing what is right for you. When we stand in our truth -- without embarrassment, without fear -- we remove layers of stress and panic. And that makes us happier and more present for those we love. That strikes me as the most generous gift any of us has to give. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Suze Orman.","Suze Orman says holiday shopping makes us forget our sound spending practices .
She says how we spend should reflect our financial situation in the here and now, not last year .

"(CNN) -- Given the chance, the United States would go after high-value terrorism targets in Pakistan or elsewhere in the same way it took out Osama bin Laden, President Barack Obama made clear in an interview with the BBC broadcast Sunday. ""We are very respectful of the sovereignty of Pakistan, but we cannot allow someone who is actively planning to kill our people or our allies' people, we can't allow those kind of active plans to come to fruition without us taking some action,"" Obama said in the interview conducted last week. ""And our hope is and our expectation is that we can achieve that in a way that is fully respectful of Pakistan's sovereignty. But I had made no secret. I had said this when I was running for the presidency, that if I had a clear shot at Bin Laden ... that we'd take it."" The raid by U.S. Navy SEALs in the early hours of May 2 on a compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan, killed bin Laden and four others. It has strained U.S. relations with Pakistan, which accused the United States of disrespecting their country's sovereignty and invading Pakistan's air space during the secret bin Laden raid. ""We've killed more terrorists on Pakistani soil than anywhere else, and that could not have been done without their co-operation,"" Obama told BBC. ""But there's more work to do. And my expectation is, is that over the coming months, this can be a wake-up call where we start seeing a more effective co-operative relationship."" Last week, U.S. Sen. John Kerry, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, tried to calm the tension during a previously planned trip to Pakistan. Kerry told Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and other officials in Islamabad on Monday that the United States need not apologize to Pakistan for the raid but that it it was in both countries' best interest to mend the frayed relationship.","President Obama tells the BBC that U.S. security is paramount .

"(CNN) -- World champion Sebastian Vettel grabbed pole position at the Canadian Grand Prix ahead of McLaren's Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso at the Gilles Villeneuve circuit on Saturday. Vettel's Red Bull car showed no diminution of speed following the FIA's order to change the rear floor of the RB8 after rival teams questioned the legality of a hole in the car's floor located in front of the rear tire. The German drivers clocked one minute 13.784son his final run -- 0.303 seconds quicker than Hamilton -- with his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber in fourth, ahead of Mercedes' Nico Rosberg and Ferrari's Felipe Massa. And two-time world champion Vettel, was quick to make reference to the changes the Red Bull car has undergone. ""I enjoyed qualifying today,"" the world champion quipped, ""even without the hole in the floor!"" In the previous six races this season pole position has been decided by just hundredths of a second, but Vettel's performance was almost a quarter of a second better than Hamilton. ""I think we have learned a couple of lessons, especially in the last two races where arguably we were quick on Sunday in the race but we didn't get the best out of the car on Saturday in qualifying,"" said the German driver. Hamilton, who has won the Canadian Grand Prix twice, added: ""I'm very, very happy with the performance. I'm very surprised to see us on the front row but nonetheless we'll definitely take it and work as hard as we can."" Meanwhile Alonso came away from qualifying pleased to notice a continuing improvement in the Ferrari car's performance. ""The car felt quite good on Friday when we tested some new parts and we feel much more happy with the balance of the car and the grip of the car, Felipe and me, straight away. ""It's a first step.

"(Budget Travel) -- Where better to while away the afternoon than a communal table at one of these beer halls and gardens, from an old-time Bohemian favorite to a newcomer with all Asian brews. The tables and benches fill up quickly inside Loreley Restaurant & Biergarten, a Lower East Side mainstay, whose stripped-down aesthetic sticks to exposed-brick walls, a planked floor, and no kitsch. Even more desirable is a spot in the patio-like garden in the back, where the concrete walls are brightened with planters. Don't come looking for the newest microbrew from the East Coast: The draft and bottle list here is German-only. Try one of the two smooth, light Kölsches, which -- like the owner -- are from Cologne. They're served in traditional narrow glasses that hold about seven ounces (200 mL). 7 Rivington St., 212/253-7077, loreleynyc.com, beer from $3. Michael ""Bao"" Huynh, who presides over a growing Vietnamese restaurant empire, brings a little bit of Southeast Asia to the Lower East Side with beer garden, Bia. Enter by navigating a facade that still looks like a greasy takeout joint -- and come ready to quaff. The options on the all-Asian beer list are delivered in ice-filled metal pails in batches of six, 12, or 24 bottles. Seafood reigns on the street-food-inspired menu; the shrimp summer rolls ($7) and red snapper in a tamarind sauce pack a flavorful punch ($18). 154 Orchard St., 212/780-0010, beer from $4.50. Budget Travel: America's top college football towns . A former candy, tobacco, and spices storage facility, Radegast Hall & Biergarten became stein central in 2007, when its long benches, oval tables, and annex with a retractable roof began to draw brew-loving locals: soccer fans, young families, and music lovers. A full kitchen means there's more than just sausages like the kielbasa ($9); either the schnitzel or the goulash, for instance, make for majorly satisfying eating (both $16). The dozen-odd draft list, primarily from Germany, includes the stellar wheat beer Franziskaner and the citrusy Blanche de Bruxelles. Well-priced specials keep both the suds and the good feelings flowing; on weekdays that vibe's often abetted by live 1920s- and '30s-era jazz. 113 N. 3rd St., Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718/963-3973, radegasthall.com, beer from $7.

Hallo Berlin takes the beer garden indoors, with picnic tables, flags, and pennants from all over Germany, and a bar with half-liter steins and one-liter glasses at the ready. The Radeberger pilsner is a rightfully popular choice. Requisite sausages like Currywurst and brats are represented, but save some room for the piquant sides, namely the potato and pickled cucumber salad. The actual garden out back is small and fills up quickly as workers make their exodus from Midtown's office towers and locals stop by to shoot the breeze over some wurst.

Although the bare-bones, redbrick courtyard and its metal café chairs and tables won't win any design awards, Vol de Nuit's distance from the street makes it a serene locale for sipping one of the Belgian beers that pair amiably with the mussels and fries -- the only things on the menu. The bar's interior is decorated with a pressed-tin ceiling, hurricane lamps, and a small bar cozied up against a back corner and dimly lit with bare red lightbulbs. It's all quite soothing.

"(Tribune Media Services) -- We're in California's famous wine country -- shopping for frying pans. That's right. We're tooling around Healdsburg, California, the small picturesque town in the heart of Sonoma County, taking in the tasting rooms, restaurants and antique shops scattered around the Plaza Park Square. My 23-year-old daughter, Reggie, is excited because she scores a cast-iron frying pan for $15. I'm excited because it is a perfect sunny fall day and I'm spending it with my husband and daughter. We're staying in San Francisco near Union Square at the recently renovated Parc 55. It's a great location, but we opt to head out of the city to Sonoma County, about an hour from San Francisco, which is home to some 1,800 growers and 450 wineries. Sonoma County, just 30 miles north of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, is closer to the city than Napa and much bigger -- more than 1,500 square miles -- roughly the size of Rhode Island. If you think wine country -- especially Sonoma County -- is just for grown-ups (at least those over 21) think again. There are plenty of places to bike, hike and kayak on the Russian River. There are many kid-friendly wineries too, complete with toy chests, picnic grounds and more, says Liza Graves, mom to 11-year-old twins and founder of Sonoma-based www.beautiful-places.com. Beautiful Places rents villas here and in Napa and can also arrange special activities for your gang. (Treasure hunt in a vineyard perhaps?) At the Benziger winery you can take a tram tour of the organic farm or sip wine while the kids get a lesson at the Insectary where ""good"" bugs (ladybugs, praying mantis) are raised to eat all the bad bugs. Roche Winery offers horseback rides and the Larson Family Winery has lots of animals. Graves notes that farms in the area invite families to watch as cheese or honey is made or give then an opportunity to try their hand at milking a cow, digging for potatoes or picking fruit. You'll find farmer's markets each day in at least one of the towns. ""We love the Sonoma farmer's market on Tuesday nights in summer in the square,"" Graves says. ""Families bring a picnic dinner and listen to live music. There are two playground areas in the park too."" Sugarloaf Ridge State Park, home to the Robert Fergus Observatory, is a good place to hike. For a more exotic kind of fun, head to Safari West, an African inspired wildlife preserve where you can see animals in their natural habitat or take teens to learn about racecar driving at the Jim Russell Racing School. If your gang loves the comic strip ""Peanuts,"" You won't want to miss the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa. For younger kids, Sonoma Train Town Railroad has a steam railroad, a Ferris wheel and a carousel. Some wine tasting for the adults will likely be on the agenda too. We start our tasting at La Crema Tasting Room. Do we like the Los Carneros Chardonnay (with its orange aromas) or the Russian River Chardonnay (with hints of butterscotch and honeysuckle)? We taste a Pinot Noir (aromas of blueberry) and a Sonoma County Syrah (hints of black licorice). I love them all but my daughter warns me to pace myself; it is, after all, just 11 a.m.! We head around the corner to Murphy-Goode Tasting Room where I love the Claret. I think it would be good with Thanksgiving Turkey. I'm learning to just take one sip. Next we stop in at Powell's Sweet Shoppe where we find every variety of candy (Mexican dinner gummies, sour grape ""pucker powder,"" nerds, sweet tarts, etc.), old-fashioned toys (juggle balls, a Mr. Bill doll) and scrumptious gelato (dark chocolate peanut butter or pistachio). Lunchtime already? We head to a local landmark Jimtown Store where we eat lunch in a grape arbor feasting on just-made curry chicken salad and the best bean salad I've ever eaten. We indulge in a ginger cookie for dessert. A group of cyclists is eating lunch too, which makes me feel guilty that we're touring in a car rather than getting some much-needed exercise. Just down the road is Stonestreet Winery, which is owned by Jess Jackson who also owns Kendall-Jackson Winery, one of California's largest wineries. An attorney, Jackson began growing grapes on land he'd purchased in 1974. Eight years later, he produced his first wine, which ultimately won kudos and awards. Our ""wine educator,"" Jonathan Tyer, is so passionate about wine that he plans to enroll in graduate school next fall at UC Davis. Tyer is already an accomplished and prize-winning home vintner whose enthusiasm is infectious, as he explains how all of these wines are grown on the hillsides. Sipping our wine, we get a rare behind-the-scenes peak at the operation -- the oak barrels where the juice is pressed out of the grapes, the lab where the science of winemaking is conducted to test sugar composition. Too soon we have to head back to the city to meet some friends for a last-night-in-San Francisco dinner. We opt for a new hip spot we think the twentysomethings in the gang will like -- Starbelly, located in the Castro area and known for its beers and house-cured meats. We feast on mini corndogs, Starbelly salumi, mortadella, salami, fall squash and goat cheese pizza. Not only is the food delicious but it's also affordable. Did I mention dessert? Warm pear crumble, caramel pot de creme or chocolate spice doughnut with peanut butter curry ice cream. The twentysomethings love the place ... just as my daughter loved our day in Sonoma -- and her new frying pan. It's nice to see you can still take the kids -- even when they are over 21.

"(CNN) -- The North Korean rocket launch that threw its neighbors in the Asian region into high alert was greeted with relief on Friday as previously jittery stock markets gained ground and bans on activities in its projected flight path were relaxed. Meanwhile, China state media labeled Japanese missile defense plans against the launch as a ""pretext"" to contain Beijing. South Korea and Japanese governments strongly condemned the North Korean rocket launch, but some critics in Japan questioned why it took Tokyo so long to officially react to the launch. North Korean rocket launches in the past have flown over parts of southern Japan, heightening tensions in the buildup to Friday's failed launched. In a press conference, Japanese lawmaker Osamu Fujimura told people to ""stay calm and go about their normal business,"" the Daily Yomiuri reported. However, Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto complained on Twitter that there had been no government statement on the rocket until 8:31 a.m. -- nearly an hour after the launch. ""Information from the television was much faster,"" he said. China Daily ran a piece saying, ""DPRK launch is just a pretext."" ""Japan hopes to use the DPRK's satellite launch to examine its missile defense capabilities under simulated conditions,"" said the opinion piece in the state-run publication. The launch is a ""proactive policy for containing China and reinforcing its hold on islands it seized from China."" Likewise the U.S. deployed its most advanced radar system to the region and ""taking advantage of the launch, to persuade Japan, the ROK (Republic of Korea) and Australia to create a regional missile shield,"" the article said. North Korean defectors in China told Japan's Asahi newspaper that the cash spent on the rocket should have gone on food. ""Until I saw the television news in China, I had been grateful because the satellite launch would be proof of the development of our country's science and technology,"" a female defector told Asahi. ""But after learning about the expenses of launching the satellite from news reports during the past week, I feel very sad."" ""I would say Great Leader Kim Jong Il got along well with the international community,"" the defector told Asahi. ""Having moved to the era of his son (Kim Jong Un), I am worried about where our country is heading."" Seoul said Pyongyang has to take full responsibility for the launch it condemned as a provocative threat to peace and stability in Northeast Asia, according to Yonhap, the state affiliated news agency. South Korea's major business organizations strongly criticized the launch. In a statement, the Federation of Korean Industries denounced the launch as a ""provocative"" act that threatened peace on the Korean Peninsula, Yonhap reported. Meanwhile, South Korea stocks opened higher after the launch, signaling that there likely would be little economic repercussions from the launch, the news agency said. The Philippines lifted a ban on flying, fishing and sailing in some parts of Luzon after the failed launch, but still had a no-fly zone in effect in some areas that authorities feared may have been in the flight path of the rocket. But some criticized the government's pre-launch preparations as an overreaction, GMA News reported. ""(The government's) 'disaster preparedness' is unprecedented in this instance since we do not see such a level of preparation and activity when typhoons arrive in the country,"" said Giovanni Tapang, a professor at the University of the Philippines National Institute of Physics. CNN's Kevin Voigt, Jaime FlorCruz, Tian Shao and Paula Hancocks contributed to this article .","China state media labeled Japanese plans against the launch as a ""pretext"" to contain Beijing .

"(CNN) -- Peru's health ministry is asking people to avoid beaches in Lima and north of the capital until officials can determine what caused the deaths of hundreds of dolphins and pelicans. Last month, the country's production ministry said the authorities were investigating the deaths of more than 538 pelicans, and other birds, on the northern coast. State-run TV Peru estimated that as many as to 1,200 birds have been found dead along the 100 miles (160km) of northern shoreline extending from Punta Negra, in Piura, to San JosÃ©, in the state of Lambayeque. That discovery came after close to 900 dolphins washed up dead on the northern coast of Peru this year. The investigation into the deaths of both the dolphins and the birds is ongoing, and it is not clear whether they are connected. The health ministry advised anyone who might handle any of the dead birds to wear protective clothing, such as gloves and masks. Peruvian Deputy Environment Minister Gabriel Quijandria told CNN last month the dolphins may have died from an outbreak of Morbillivirus or Brucella bacteria. Morbillivirus is a class of viruses that are part of the same family as human measles; Brucella bacteria are the cause of many serious diseases in animals. Officials have said the dolphins' deaths were not due to lack of food, interaction with fisheries, poisoning with pesticides, biotoxin poisoning or contamination by heavy metals. ""When you have something this large, my gut would tell me that there's something traumatic that happened,"" Sue Rocca, a marine biologist with the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, told CNN last month. She raised a number of possibilities as to what could have killed the animals, including acoustic trauma. Preliminary reports ruled out the possibility that seismic sound waves created by oil exploration in the area could have killed the birds, the environment ministry has said. Bird flu has also been ruled out.","The health ministry asks people to avoid beaches in Lima and north of the capital .
