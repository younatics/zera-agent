Anti-government protesters toppled a statue of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin in Ukraine's capital and attacked it with hammers on Sunday in a symbolic challenge to President Viktor Yanukovich and his plans for closer ties with Russia. The gesture rejecting Moscow's historic influence over Ukraine came after opposition leaders told hundreds of thousands of demonstrators on Kiev's Independence Square to keep up pressure on Yanukovich to sack his government. The protesters are furious that the government decided last month to ditch a landmark pact with the European Union in favour of closer economic cooperation with Moscow, Ukraine's Soviet-era overlord. Scroll down for video . Anger: An anti-government protester beats the statue of Vladimir Lenin with a sledgehammer in Kiev, Ukraine, on Sunday . Protestors cheer as the blows rain down. An estimated 200,000 Ukrainians have occupied central Kiev . Yanukovich's sudden tack towards Russia has provoked the biggest street protests since the 2004-5 Orange Revolution, when people power forced a re-run of a fraud-tainted election and thwarted his first run for the presidency. 'Yanukovich, you are next!' read a poster stuck on the plinth where the red granite statue of Lenin had stood. People hacked off chunks of the prostrate - and now headless - leader of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution to take home as souvenirs. Cheered by the crowd, a woman planted an EU flag on the pedestal where the 11 ft-high statue had stood since 1946. Opposition leaders denied any link to its removal, clearly concerned that such an act could harm their cause. The spokesman of Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov called the felling of the statue 'barbarism', Interfax news agency reported. Ukrainian protesters put up Ukrainian flags in place of the staue of Lenin (left). In this taken at the beginning of December (right), police guard the monument as the level of protest mounts . The authorities and protesters have confronted each other for weeks, raising fears for political and economic stability in the former Soviet republic of 46 million people. The demonstrators have erected blockades to defend the central Independence Square - now transformed into a tent village, sustained by donations of food and clothing - from any police attempt to retake it. They are occuping key public buildings and on Sunday erected blockades and tents on roads in the government district. 'This is a decisive moment when all Ukrainians have gathered here because they don't want to live in a country where corruption rules and where there is no justice,' said Vitaly Klitschko, a reigning world heavyweight boxing champion and leader of the opposition Udar (Punch) party. Ukraine's opposition accuses Yanukovich, who met Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, of preparing to take the country into a Moscow-led customs union, which they see as an attempt to recreate the Soviet Union.

An EU flag was erected atop the plint, drawing cheers from the massed protestors. The demonstrators have erected blockades to defend the central Independence Square - now transformed into a tent village, sustained by donations of food and clothing - from any police attempt to retake it . Yanukovich has said he decided to shelve the EU trade deal because it would have been too costly for Ukraine's struggling economy and the country needs more time to prepare. He says he is preparing a 'strategic partnership' with Russia, but has not committed to joining the customs union. 'We are on a razor's edge between a final plunge into cruel dictatorship and a return home to the European community,' jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko said in a message to Sunday's rally, read out by her daughter Yevgenia. 'Don't give in, not a step back, don't give up, the future of Ukraine is in your hands,' the message read. Last weekend, riot police beat protesters and journalists, drawing EU condemnation and swelling protesters' ranks. Klitschko, increasingly seen as a national leader-in-waiting, told Sunday's crowd that their protests must remain peaceful, adding: 'We do not want to be kept quiet by a policeman's truncheon.' The protestors have denounced President Viktor Yanukovych's decision to turn away from Europe and align this ex-Soviet republic with Russia .

He demanded the release of political prisoners, punishment of those responsible for last weekend's crackdown, the resignation of Prime Minister Azarov's government and early presidential and parliamentary elections. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso urged Yanukovich by phone on Sunday to seek a dialogue with his opponents and to respect civil freedoms, the EU executive said. Opposition leaders denied any link to its removal, clearly concerned that such an act could harm their cause. The spokesman of Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov called the felling of the statue 'barbarism' EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton will visit Kiev this week to help to find a way out of the crisis, it said. Interfax news agency said Yanukovich also discussed the situation with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Kiev and Moscow have both denied that Putin and Yanukovich discussed the customs union when they met in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, but further talks are planned for Dec. 17. Yanukovich and Putin, who regards Ukraine as strategically vital to Moscow's interests, are widely believed to have struck a bargain whereby Ukraine will get cheaper Russian gas and possibly credits in exchange for backing away from the EU. A group of protesters, chanting 'revolution', started erecting tents and barricades near the government building after Sunday's rally, apparently aiming to halt normal government activity next week. Riot police stood guard nearby. 'We will stay till our demands are met and there is a change of government,' said a 22-year-old man draped in a Ukrainian flag who gave his name as Sergei. 'We don't want to be under Russia's thumb.' Independence Square, nucleus of the protest movement, is festooned with blue and yellow national flags and EU flags. People huddle around braziers to keep warm. In a gesture sure to annoy Yanukovich, protesters hoisted a huge portrait of Tymoshenko onto a New Year tree, plastered with anti-government placards, that towers over the square. The protest camp has been swelled by huge numbers arriving from Ukrainian-speaking western and central regions, where the opposition enjoys strong support. A Tymoshenko ally, former interior minister Yuri Lutsenko, urged people in eastern Russian-speaking areas - the bedrock of Yanukovich's power - to join them. 'We are the same people as you are, except they stole from you earlier,' he said. Sales worker Sviatislav Zaporozhit, 26, said the demonstrators were united by the desire for a change of government. 'I don't want to go back to what my parents lived under the Soviet Union,' he said. 'When I am old, I want to live like people in Europe. I want to live in a normal country'","Hundreds of thousands attend rally on Kiev's Independence square .

Using a real donkey in a children’s nativity play must have seemed like a good idea to organisers hoping to bring their open-air event to life. But ‘elf and safety’ rules mean that rather than just a simple shawl, Mary will arrive sporting a crash helmet – in case she falls off the animal. The Bridge Church in Neath, near Swansea in South Wales - which is organising the performance - brought in the measure after the donkey’s owner insisted it must follow council guidelines. Crash test: Organisers of a children's nativity play have been told the girl playing Mary must wear a crash helmet - in case she falls off the donkey (file picture) Organisers: The open air play is being organised by The Bridge Church, pictured, in Neath, near Swansea . Church youth worker Mark Barrett, 44, said: 'We’ve been advised that any young child riding a horse or donkey needs a hard hat for health and safety purposes. 'The owner of the donkey has asked us to do this to make sure we’re in keeping with council guidelines and his insurance policy. 'We don’t really mind, we’ve just got to comply with it, we’ve got to do everything we can to make sure everyone is happy.

A teenager whose mother suffered sexual abuse from the age of eight has revealed the shocking moment she learned her grandfather was also her father. Arie Kibibi, 19, appeared on Katie Couric's show on Monday afternoon with her mother, Aziza Kibibi, 35, who detailed the years of abuse - and five pregnancies - at the hands of her father. Her father, Aswad Ayinde, a successful music video director best known for the Fugees' 'Killing Me Softly', was sentenced to 50 years in prison in August for the sickening abuse. Arie told Katie that, as she grew up, she repeatedly asked her mother who her father was, and all her mother would ever say was that he was someone her grandfather had approved of. Scroll down for video . Together: Aziza Kibibi, right, appeared on Katie Couric's show on Monday to recount years of sexual abuse at the hands of her father. She was joined by her 19-year-old daughter, Arie . But 'when I was 14, she told me,' Arie said. 'She said, ""Your father is my father"". I just froze.' However, she was also struck with an overwhelming sense of love and respect for her mother, who has showed extraordinary courage as she has taken control of her life. 'When I found out what happened to my mother, I only felt more love for her,' Arie said. Kibibi, who grew up in Paterson, New Jersey, was just eight when she was first abused by her father. To her, Ayinde had always been the perfect father so she trusted him when he told her he was going to teach her 'how to be a woman'. 'It . was overwhelming in my mind and it was overwhelming for my body,' she . said of the rapes. 'Inside my head I just wanted to scream out. 'He . said that all fathers did this with their daughters and that moms . didn't understand. He told me I was his sex slave. He told me that this . is what god put me here to do.' Strength: Aziza Kibibi spoke out on the Katie Couric show about the years of sexual abuse she endured at the hands of her father, a successful music video producer who impregnated her five times . Close: Aziza told Arie that her grandfather was also her father when she was 14 and Arie said that knowing her mother had gone through so much and survived just made her love her more . She added: 'At the time I was obeying him, and I respected him and I love him, so I did what he said.' For . years she endured the abuse - too scared to run away in case because he . had told her he would abuse the next oldest sister instead if she went . anywhere. When she was about 15, she walked in on her father abusing her sister, who was 11. Kibibi, who had believed she was protecting her sister by enduring the abuse, was at an even greater loss. 'When . I saw what he was doing to her, I was heartbroken,' Kibibi said. 'Nothing he said could be trusted. At the same time I felt defeated.' Throughout Kibibi's terrifying ordeal, her mother knew what was happening, she said. But . rather than be angry at her - then or now - Kibibi said she knew her . mother was being abused by her father and that she was probably . overwhelmed with conflicting emotions, including jealousy. 'He . told her he was molesting me in order to help my skin condition,' Kibibi said. 'She complied with what he told her... I'm sure fear played . a big role in it. She was afraid of him.' Speaking out: Aziza appeared on the Katie Couric show on Monday so other victims will not feel alone . Harrowing: Couric asks Aziza about the years of abuse, which began when she was just eight years old . On . one occasion, Kibibi's mother called the police to report her husband's . abuse but she said that nothing was done to help her - leaving her . mother to feel alone. 'He started to appear like this untouchable,' she said. 'He could get away with things. I think she just gave up.' When she was 16, Kibibi gave birth to her first child and her father . delivered the baby girl at their home. With no apparent genetic . problems, her father was convinced that there was nothing wrong. 'He . decided that she was going to be the beginning of a new race,' she said. 'He said he . understands now why royalty inbreeds, to keep the bloodline pure.' Sickening: Aswad Ayinde was sentenced to 50 years in prison for the sexual abuse . She . went on to carry five more of his children and give birth to four. One . daughter, who suffered from two genetic diseases, passed away when she . was nine. But the following children would not . be so lucky. Two further daughters born from her father would be . diagnosed with phenylketonuria (PKU) a disease that prevents the body . from breaking down amino acids. PKU can cause brain damage and seizures. When she was older and one of her sons fell sick, she finally got the courage to take him to the hospital since Ayinde was out of town on a business trip. But she didn't know how to interact with the doctors and a social worker stepped in, alerting the Department of Youth a Family Services. When Ayinde returned from his business trip he was enraged, and threatened to forcibly remove his son from the hospital. Child services stepped in before he could do that and placed them in separate homes. After that Kibibi, her mother and her sisters moved away from Ayinde as she attempted to get her children back. Having to fight to get her children back also empowered Kibibi, and translated to her life after abuse. She now lives in East Orange, New Jersey with her husband. She went back to school for her GED and will finish her liberal arts degree from Essex County College this fall. She also runs her own baking business and plans to start a restaurant someday. Kibibi and her sister decided to finally bring charges against their abusive father. They delayed pressing charges since they were unsure the affect it would have on the children. Ayinde, who is also known as Charles . McGill, was sentenced to 50 years in prison on July 26, finally ending . Kibibi's nightmare. He has three more trials against him pending. Kibibi was shocked when Katie Couric read out a statement from her father's attorney, saying that he claimed he was not guilty. No remorse: Ayinde claims he is innocent - to which his daughter says: 'I leave him to God' 'For him to continue to say he didn't do any of these to things, attempting to make me look like a liar, it saddens me,' she said. 'But I leave him to God . ultimately.' As for her mother, she said that there are no hard feelings there. 'I've forgiven my mom,' she said. 'We're actually very . close... I know she was abused. I know there has to be a lot . of conflicts there. but I know she wishes she did everything so . differently.' While . the identities of sexual abuse victims stay protected, Kibibi decided . to step forward to share her story in order to help other victims. 'There . are a lot of other girls and women out there that are suffering from . sexual abuse,' she said. 'One of the things that my father used to do to . control us was to stay quiet... As a survivor, I decided that I should . speak out.'","Aziza Kibibi, now 35, was raped by her father from the age of 8 .

Taxpayers may have been overcharged by millions of pounds under a £700million criminal  tagging contract. Auditors have been called in to examine payments to Serco and G4S, which monitor around 20,000 criminals at any one time. Officials have ‘identified potential issues in relation to billing’, according to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. Taxpayers could have overpaid two private companies for their work tagging criminals . The concerns apparently relate to how many offenders were on tags and for how long. PricewaterhouseCoopers will examine . how the contract operated and analyse the figures supplied by Serco and . G4S to the Ministry of Justice. Both firms have pledged to repay any money claimed in error. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling wants to expand the use of private companies in rehabilitation services . Mr Grayling said: ‘I take this issue . very seriously and my  priority is to ensure that taxpayers’ money is . spent appropriately and delivers value for money.’ The devices are put on suspects who are on bail and on criminals released early from prison under a home detention curfew. Keith Vaz, chairman of the  Commons . home affairs select committee, called for a full audit of all Justice . Ministry contracts with Serco and G4S. A tender process this year will see criminals given GPS tags to track their movements at all times. The current system works only to alert controllers when the offender leaves home or takes the tag off. The revelation is embarrassing for Mr . Grayling as he prepares to rolls out to hand up to 70 per cent of . probation services over to the private sector or charities. Companies like G4S and Serco will be . able to bid for payment-by-results contracts to supervise low to medium . level offenders across England and Wales. The providers will be judged . by whether or not they cut reoffending rates. But . the use of firms like G4S have been thrown into the spotlight after it . failed to provide thousands of guards to provide security for the London . Olympics, leading to the arm to be called in. Now . an independent team is conduct an audit of electronic tagging . contracts, including information from G4S and Serco. It is also . examining how the contract was run by the Government department. Mr Grayling: ‘I take this issue very seriously and my priority is to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent appropriately and delivers value for money. ‘As a result of information which has recently come to light as part of the retendering process for electronic monitoring contracts, my department has identified potential issues in relation to billing under the current contracts which were originally let in 2005. ‘Working with our suppliers, we are taking immediate action to address this. ‘We have asked a high-quality independent team to audit the processes and the information supplied to the department by G4S and Serco.’ The review is expected to report back within six weeks. Electronic tagging is used as a method of monitoring offenders in the community and can be used to make sure criminals stick to court-imposed curfews. The equipment consists of a tag, fitted to the offender's ankle, and a monitoring unit in the home or other place of curfew. All movements in and out of the home, or other activities such as removal of the tag or tampering with the equipment, are reported to a control centre. Mr Grayling added: ‘Our suppliers have told me that they take this seriously too, they are co-operating fully and they have given me clear assurances that if any adjustment is required to charges made to date, this will be put right promptly and repayments made. ‘Carrying out this audit does not impact on the operation of the electronic monitoring service, and its important role in protecting the public.’ Elaine Bailey, managing director at Serco Home Affairs, said: ‘Serco takes its responsibilities as a provider of public services extremely seriously. ‘We have every confidence that we deliver a good service to the Ministry of Justice on the electronic monitoring contract and we will co-operate fully with the audit announced by the Secretary of State.’ A G4S spokeswoman: ‘We believe that we are delivering our electronic monitoring (EM) service in a completely open and transparent way. ‘The EM service contracts have previously been audited by the National Audit Office, which concluded that our service offered “good value for money to the taxpayer”.’ The use of private firms for government contracts was thrown into the spotlight when G4S failed to recruit thousands of guards to provide security at the London Olympics . Serco said it was 'cooperating fully' with the investigation into payments by the Ministry of Justice . Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘The Home Affairs Select Committee has warned the Government that companies that have failed to deliver ought to be monitored very carefully and that means complete monitoring. ‘The Ministry of Justice clearly failed to do so despite knowing the difficulties with G4S. ‘G4S and Serco currently hold 17 contracts with the Home Office and it is essential a complete audit of these contracts is now conducted.’","G4S and Serco may have received too much taxpayers' money .

On the move: Banksy painted 'Flower Girl' on the side of a Los Angeles gas station in 2008 - it sold Thursday at auction . The piece was completed in 2008 using Banksy’s trademark stencil-style, according to an auction house statement. It shows a young girl wearing a dress and carrying a basket of flowers while looking up at a camera sitting at the top of a taller-than-life flower stem – it is named ‘Flower Girl.’ ‘In ‘Flower Girl,’ the artist poignantly juxtaposes the innocence of a young girl picking flowers with the curious and questioning gaze of someone not yet willing to back down,’ said the statement. As it originally appeared: 'Flower Girl' before it was removed from a Hollywood Chevron station . Where it all began: This gas station, now a Chevron, is where the Banksy mural was resided before being removed . Workers removed it from a Hollywood Chevron station so it could be sold at Thursday’s auction. Four other Banksy pieces were sold Thursday for a total of $248,000, Reuters noted. Among them was ‘TV Girl,’ which sold for $137,000. ‘Flower Girl’ was sold as part of an auction featuring only street art, and was among a collection of 92 total pieces put up for sale. The pieces pulled in a small fortune, but they were not the highest-selling Banksy works of all-time. That distinction goes to a piece known as ‘Slave Labour,’ according to Reuters. ‘Slave Labour,’ which shows a young child making Union Jack patches on an industrial sewing machine, sold for $1.1million at a recent London auction. More Banksy pieces will sell later this month in Miami, Reuters noted.","The mural, named 'Flower Girl,' was first painted in 2008 .

He was found guilty of animal cruelty and banned from keeping pets after saying: 'It's my dog, I don't need lessons. They started chasing me for nothing' Accused: Grice, 25, swore at a photographer outside court, where he was found guilty of animal cruelty . RSPCA inspector Kat Hamblin said: 'You can tell he hasn't been treated very well as he cowers when people make sudden movements. 'He needs training, but despite everything he's been through, Milo likes people and is a great little dog. With a bit of love and care, he'll make a lovely pet for someone.' Grice, who was given the dog by his mother, told the court the bystanders had 'rudely interrupted' him on the way to his breakfast, adding: 'It's my dog, I don't need lessons. They started chasing me for nothing.' Magistrates heard he shouted angrily at Milo, lifting the dog up by the collar several feet into the air. He then punched the terrified terrier in the head and hurled him to the pavement head-first.

Grice ran, said Mr Harris, adding: 'The dog's legs were being dragged along the concrete . pavement because he couldn't keep up with the speed the man was running . at.' The driver of the car, teacher Robyn Stevenson, 23, also saw the abuse and followed Grice on foot. She said: 'I was disgusted that he could do that to . an animal. He showed no remorse and just screamed ""It's my dog"". Attack: Demmi Grice, from Rochdale, had denied smashing Milo's head into the pavement in broad daylight . 'I was shaking like a leaf, I've got dogs of my own and it was horrible to watch.' Grice accepted that he shouted at the dog . and held him up by the lead, but denied one count of causing . unnecessary suffering to an animal. Grice, who swore at a photographer as he left court, claimed the witnesses were lying and he had not punched the dog or thrown it to the ground. He insisted he was a good dog owner and his pet had never missed a meal or a walk. The yob was banned from keeping animals . for five years after being convicted of causing unnecessary suffering to . an animal by Bury magistrates. He was ordered to pay a total of £1,049 in fines and costs. Chairman of the bench Julia De Sousa told . Grice: 'We find what you did to that little Jack Russell cruel and . unkind and we hope that is reflected in the sentence.' Milo will be rehomed if Grice does not lodge an appeal within 21 days.

As a gift for her first mother's day, Kayla Andre's husband had requested that the Photo Center at the store's branch in Spruce Grove, Alberta, Canada, print the touching image with the words 'Two Hearts Entwined Forever.' But when he arrived to collect it, staff told him that it violated the store's nudity policy, and so they were unable to create the print for him. Touching gift: As a gift for her first mother's day, Kayla Andre's husband had requested that the Photo Center at Walmart in Spruce Grove, Alberta, Canada, print an image of her breastfeeding their baby . 'When he went to go pick it up, they brought the photo out and said . unfortunately, although this means a lot to you, we canâ€™t print it for . you and we cannot sell it to you,' Mrs Andre told CTV Edmonton.

Explaining the situation further, he told CTV that store policy probably had not been well-explained to young and new photo center employees. 'In this particular case, we hadn't done a very good job of making . sure that procedure was crystal clear,' he said. He added that Walmart would be amending policy guidelines for employees in the wake of the debacle.

"By . Alex Greig and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:59 EST, 9 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:20 EST, 9 December 2013 . The campus police officer who shot dead an unarmed straight A-student outside San Antonio says he opened fire because he felt his life was in danger, it has been revealed. Corporal Chris Carter, who serves on the police force for the University of Incarnate Word, fired multiple shots and killed Robert Cameron Redus, 23, about 2am Friday after a routine traffic stop. More than 200 people - including Redus' mother and father - turned out a vigil Sunday to mourn the UIW student and remember his short life. My son: Mother of Robert Cameron Redus is hugged by Emily Vaughan, a friend of the family as people gather at the University of the Incarnate Word grotto as part of the vigil for Cameron Redus who was killed by a university police officer . Devastated: Robert Cameron Redus' brother and father listen to tributes and prayers in his honor at a candlelight vigil . College shooting: Cameron Redus was killed after a campus cop shot him multiple times during a traffic stop . 'We are understandably devastated by . the death of our dear son Cameron and we ask for your prayers as we deal . with our tragic loss,' his family said in a statement. 'We trust that God is faithful and will see us through this most difficult time.' Cpl Carter, the officer who killed Redus, pulled the student over not far from campus in Alamo Heights because he was speeding and 'driving erratically,' according to police. The officer, who has been placed on leave pending the outcome of the shooting investigation, has an 'extensive law enforcement background,' according to the university. However, part of the background involves jumping from job-to-job on a regular basis, according to employment records obtained by the San Antonio Express-News. Cpl Carter has had nine jobs at eight different agencies over his eight-year law enforcement career. He rarely stayed in any job for more than a year and the two years and seven months as a campus officer for UIW was the longest stint in his career. KVUE-TV reports that Cpl Carter has told investigators he feared for his life. It's not clear what actions the unarmed Redus took to make the officer believe he was in danger of being killed. When Redus pulled over at an apartment complex off Broadway, police said Redus got out of his truck and allegedly attacked Carter. A struggle ensued between the officer and Redus before Carter opened fire and fatally shot the student, police said. Memories: The ceremony included many remembrances from friends in the UIW community. A candlelight vigil was also held on campus at the Lourdes Grotto. Redus' brother and mother can be seen on the right of the picture . Green is the color: A vigil was held inside the Academic Convocation Center. Many in attendance either wore green clothing or a green ribbon as it was his favorite color. Redus' brother is seen here . Several of Redus' friends spoke to the media Derrick Bryant said he knew Redus most of his life. The two went to high school together at the Baytown Christian Academy. 'He was the most intelligent, artistic, creative and genius mind I have ever come across,' Bryant said, crying. Kyle Leihsing, a San Antonio native had been friends with Redus for three years. 'He was one of the most level-headed people I've ever met. What I have heard is completely counter-intuitive to what I have known him to be,' he said, referring to accounts of Redus initiating an altercation with the officer who shot him.' 'There's just an outpouring of genuine grief among hundreds, if not thousands, of people in our community because he was so well-liked and loved,' Annie Jones, a friend of Redus, told KENS 5. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the student and officer involved in this incident,' UIW President Dr. Lou Agnese said. Redus had moved to San Antonio from Baytown for school. He went to Baytown Christian Academy and graduated as co-valedictorian. Honored: Redus's father spoke at the vigil to remember his son . Come together: Close friends of Cameron Redus come to a vigill. Many in attendance either wore green clothing or a green ribbon as it was his favorite color . His academic success continued at UIW, where he had been named to the Dean's List and was a part-time anchor for the school's student newscast. 'I grieve on behalf of his parents, because I know how devastated they are. He was a sweet, sweet person,' said family friend Annie Jones. A witness says he heard the sarcastic . final words of a Texas student moments before he was shot dead by a . college police officer. Neighbour Mohammad Haidaras told My San Antonio that he heard a tense exchange between Redus and Carter sixty seconds before shots rang out. He told the website: 'I heard (a man) say, 'Oh, you're gonna shoot me?' like sarcastic almost.' The 22-year-old claims he heard gunshots less than a minute later and jumped into his closet. Investigators say an altercation began when Carter tried to pull Redus over for speeding and driving erratically. Big turnout: Family and friends of University of the Incarnate Word student Robert Cameron Redus gather for a candlelight vigil and tribute . Feeling loss: The ceremony included many remembrances from friends in the UIW community. A candlelight vigil was also held on campus at the Lourdes Grotto . Under investigation: The parking lot of Redus' apartment block where he died is cordoned off by police . Lieutenant Cindy Pruitt of the Alamo Heights Police Department told KSAT that the incident occurred about 2am in the parking lot of the Tree House apartments in the 100 block of Grandview Place off Broadway, where Redus was a resident. Redus, known to friends by his second name Cameron, had spent the evening celebrating the end of semester with classmates. It is not clear where Carter first tried to pull Redus over, but both vehicles drove north on Broadway until they pulled into the parking lot of the Treehouse Apartments. Once there, both got out of their cars and some kind of struggle ensued. Pruitt told My San Antonio that Carter radioed for help shortly before Redus was shot. A witness who lives in the Treehouse Apartments described hearing 'five or six' gunshots, but no verbal warnings. 'I didn't hear him say anything like, ""Get down on your hands and knees,"" you know? I didn't hear him say anything. He just started shooting,' the man told KSAT. 'He emptied the gun on him,' he said. 'Boom, boom, boom.' Scuffle: Witnesses heard a short exchange between Redus and the officer before shots were fired . Graduation in sight: Redus was set to graduate from the University of the Incarnate Word in May . Not aggressive: Cameron Redus' friends and family can't understand how someone as gentle and kind as him could have been shot by a police officer . Mohammad Haidarasl lives directly below Redus at the Treehouse Apartments. He told My San Antonio that he was asleep on his sofa when he heard an exchange between Redus and Carter. 'I heard [a man] say, ""Oh, you're gonna shoot me?"" like sarcastic almost,' he said. Less than a minute later, Haidarasl heard four to six gunshots. He only realized the man who had been shot was his upstairs neighbor, whom Haidrasl described as 'the nicest guy.' Carter has been placed on administrative leave while officers investigate the shooting. Devastated: Friends Sarah Davis (left) and Annie Jones (right) speak of their disbelief at the shooting of Cameron Redus . Celebration turns to tragedy: Redus was out celebrating the end of semester before he died at the hands of a police officer . Officers investigating the incident haven't attempted to contact Haidrasl about what he heard, Haidrasl told My San Antonio. Back in Redus' hometown of Baytown, the promising student's mother, father, brothers and friends are struggling to understand their loss. 'We are understandably devastated by the death of our dear son Cameron and we ask for your prayers as we deal with our tragic loss. We trust that God is faithful and will see us through this most difficult time,' the victim's family said in a statement. Redus old friends from high school were shocked to hear the news. 'He was so kind. He’s not an aggressive person at all,' friend Sara Davis told KHOU. 'The story doesn’t really make sense to any of us.' 'He was an honor student, dean’s list every semester, incredibly intelligent,' said Annie Jones. 'So, so, so smart. He was our co-valedictorian in high school.' A vigil has been set for 7pm on Saturday at the University of the Incarnate Word grotto.

Jailed jobless father-of-17 Mick Philpott was 'earning' the equivalent of a £100,000 salary in benefits and wages from his wife and live-in lover, it emerged today. The violent drug user forced wife Mairead and mistress Lisa Willis to pay all their money from cleaning jobs and child tax credits into his bank account while he lounged on the settee watching TV. But even that wasn't enough for the former soldier, who hatched a plan to frame Miss Willis for the fire which killed six of this children in an appalling attempt to secure a larger council house. Scroll down for video . Scrounger: Mick Philpott (pictured with his wife Mairead, centre, his mother Peggy, right, and sons Jesse, right in green, and John, far right) claimed thousands of pounds in benefit and refused to get a job . Plot: Over the past eight weeks, Nottingham Crown Court has heard how the house was set on fire last May as part of a plan to frame Mick Philpott's former live-in lover Lisa Willis . Details of his finances emerged as . Philpott, 56, Mairead, 32, and their friend Paul Mosley, 46, were handed . lengthy jail prison sentences after each were found guilty of six . counts of manslaughter. Judge Mrs Justice Thirlwall told Philpott he 'did not even allow' his wife or lover 'their own door key'. During . the trial, Nottingham Crown Court heard Philpott had lost £1,000 a . month when Miss Willis moved out of the family home in Allenton, Derby, . with her five children. He . had been receiving a total of £8,023.60 a year in child benefit, while . Mairead and Miss Willis were given £20,560 and £17,870 a year . respectively, it was reported by The Times. The two women had cleaning jobs which brought in an extra £14,000. Tragic: Mick Philpott (centre) hatched a plan to frame mistress Lisa Willis for the fire which killed six of his children . Philpott, who has not worked since 2004, also received an estimated £150 a week to cover the rent on their three-bedroom house, bringing in a further £7,800 a year to take the total to around £67,000.

Lisa Willis: Up to £17,870 for her five children . Estimated earnings from their cleaning jobs: £14,000 . Yearly total: £38,430 . Housing benefit . Philpott: £150 a week . Yearly total: £7,800 . ESTIMATED GRAND TOTAL: £68,000 . This is the approximate take-home pay of someone earning £100,000 . As Working Tax Credits and Child Benefits were paid tax-free, his 'take-home pay' could have been similar to a man earning around £100,000 a year, putting him in the top two per cent of earners. Mairead's sisters Jennifer and Bernadette told how they frequently tried to rescue her and the children from Philpott's clutches after the household starting imploding when Miss Willis left. They explained how Mairead attempted suicide in the months before the fire. Jennifer Lobban told Panorama: 'We would try and get round there when he was doing the school run because we knew that he wouldn’t be in the house. 'We told her that we could go to the school, we could go now; go take the kids from school. We would get her out, but she just wouldn’t leave.' Philpott once allowed the eldest child, Duwayne, 13, to have a sleepover at Bernadette’s house. Bernadette said the little boy was in a terrible state, adding: 'Mick said he hadn’t eaten for a week and I took him and my little boy out for a pizza. I had never seen a child eat so fast in my life.’ Liar: Mick (right) and Mairead Philpott appear to cry during a news conference at Derby Conference Centre following a fire at their home which claimed the lives of six of his children . Over the past eight weeks, Nottingham Crown Court has heard how they set fire to their house last May as part of a plan to frame Philpott’s former live-in lover Miss Willis. She had walked out of the shared three-bedroom semi in Allenton, Derby, with her five children and the thousands of pounds in benefits they were worth to Philpott. The fire was also set in an attempt to get a bigger council house, a demand Philpott had infamously made six years earlier on the Jeremy Kyle Show.

Attending a fund-raising dinner, the Shadow Chancellor boasted that he was the ‘Co-operative Shadow Chancellor’ who was ‘looking forward to taking co-operation into the Treasury when we get the chance’. Mr Balls also said the bank would go from ‘strength to strength’ – even though disgraced chairman Paul Flowers had just been forced out for what it is now known to be major concerns about his expenses. Ed Balls (left) speaks to Peter Marks at a reception at Downing Street for the launch of a Co-Op venture in 2010 . The words further undermine Mr Balls’s attempts to distance himself from the Co-operative Bank scandal and from Flowers, who was arrested late on Thursday night after revelations that he bought crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine. The senior Labour figure has received £50,000 in funding from the Co-operative movement and refuses to hand the money back, saying he was ‘proud’ to accept it. On Thursday, he said any attempts to link him to the scandal were ‘smears’. But, as Flowers was bailed until the New Year after being quizzed by police over an ‘ongoing drug supply investigation’, it emerged: . The Mail has seen the transcript of a plush dinner at which the Shadow Chancellor gushed about how the ‘fabulous’ bank had emerged from the financial crisis as one of the strongest on the High Street. The former chairman of the Co-operative Bank, Paul Flowers . The praise he heaped on the struggling bank at the annual Co-op dinner on June 20 came despite the fact that just two weeks earlier, Flowers had been forced out after it emerged the Co-op bank had racked up a £1.5billion black hole of debt. Mr Balls was forced to deny claims he was too close to the Co-op after Mr Flowers told MPs they had met at Labour Party functions. Both men attended a reception at No 10 in 2010 but Mr Balls says they did not have a conversation. His denials were undermined when it emerged that he had bragged about his role in rubber-stamping legislation that paved the way for a disastrous takeover deal at the Co-op. Mr Balls also accepted a £50,000 donation from the Co-op Group in March 2012, when Flowers was chairman of the Co-op bank. Labour has also benefited from millions of pounds in ‘soft’ loans with preferential rates of interest. Earlier this week, Mr Balls insisted that he had not held meetings with Flowers, and said he had ‘never in my life’ had a conversation with him about the funding of his office. But on June 20, the Shadow Chancellor hosted senior Co-op executives and guests from the Chinese Embassy at a private £70-per-head dinner in a luxury West-End hotel. Flowers had been on the guest list, but Labour sources said he did not attend. Speaking about the Co-operative movement, Mr Balls said: ‘We are going from strength to strength. I am the first ever Co-Operative Shadow Chancellor. But, more importantly, I have a team of five in the House of Commons including me. Three are women; two are men. ‘Three are Co-operative and Labour MPs: a majority of co-operators in the shadow Treasury team, looking forward to taking co-operation into the Treasury when we get the chance.’ He also drew attention to the fact that four ‘fabulous’ by-election successes over the last year had seen four more Labour and Co-op MPs in Parliament. ‘People ask: “Does being a Labour and Co-operative MP help you get elected?” Well, what we are seeing in this Parliament is they are queuing up to be Co-operative MPs. Because, we know, on the doorstep the values of our movement and the difference we make really makes a difference.’ Mr Balls admitted that it had been a ‘tough week’ for the Co-op movement, with Flowers having just been forced out. But he added: ‘Let’s be completely honest: the performance of the Co-operative group over recent years has been fabulous, across all its many different retail businesses. And actually, as a bank, the Co-operative bank was one of the institutions which came through the financial crisis strong enough to step in and help other organisations in difficulty and in trouble. ‘That commitment to local engagement, and to local values, the ability to innovate – that is important for the future.’ During the dinner there was an auction for Mr Balls to make a lasagne for the Co-operative member who made the winning bid. The auction proved so popular that Mr Balls promised to make lasagnes for two members who had each bid £4,000. Last night a Labour source said Mr Balls had also talked in his speech about the difficulties at the bank, how there had been a change of management and that there were significant challenges ahead. The Treasury was also dragged into the Co-op scandal last night after former Tory leadership contender David Davis questioned why officials had not spotted its financial problems years ago. Regulators and Treasury staff should have noticed its shortcomings back in 2011, the MP said, when the financial problems were becoming visible. The Co-op’s financial woes were set out in a letter in January 2012 to the Lloyds board when it made its doomed bid to take over the banking giant. The letter was written by Lord Levene, a city veteran who was heading a rival bid. Mr Davis said that should have set alarm bells ringing to the Treasury, Lloyds and UK Financial Investments, which handled the Government’s stake in the Co-op. Paul Flowers racked up a £63,000 expenses and allowances bill at Bradford Council before he was forced to resign over the discovery of porn on his laptop. The Daily Mail has learned that the disgraced former Co-op boss received the cash over three years while he was a councillor at the authority. Last night a local government minister urged the authority to find out whether the claims are genuine. Earlier this week this newspaper revealed that Flowers is suspected of claiming as much as £75,000 in false expenses while heading a drugs charity. Paul Flowers claimed £63k in expenses while serving as a councillor in Bradford . He made claims for ‘a lot of dining’ and frequent hotel stays and travel, but resigned from the Lifeline Project before internal proceedings against him could be concluded. The Co-op is also trawling through his expenses claims amid claims he may have used some of its money to fund his sordid lifestyle. It is believed that the head of the Co-op Group became concerned about Flowers’s ‘excessive use of expenses’ before he resigned. The Methodist minister claimed £63,103.77 in allowances, expenses and other perks from Bradford Council – £13,362.84 in 2009/10, £35,091.37 in 2010/11 and £14,649.56 in 2011/12. Brandon Lewis, a Tory local government minister, said: ‘This level of expenses seems suspiciously high and should be investigated. A full breakdown of what these expenses were and the business case for them needs to be looked at.’ Flowers resigned after adult material was found on his computer, but colleagues were told at the time that he left because of pressures of his work at the Co-op bank. The council’s chief solicitor, Suzan Hemingway, said all the claims had already been checked. ‘All councillors’ allowances and expenses are a matter of public record and are published on our website dating back to 2004/5,’ she added. ‘The basic allowance payable to all councillors is currently £13,042.94 a year. ‘Special responsibility allowances are paid to councillors who have significant additional responsibilities such as being a member of the executive. ‘Claims for travel, accommodation or meals are checked before any payments are made. The system for making payments is regularly audited.’ But Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Given Mr Flowers’s track record of expenses, taxpayers will be rightly concerned about how these councillor’s allowances may have been used. ‘It further adds weight to the need for a full and proper investigation into what’s happened during his time in power.’","Ed Balls said the bank would go from 'strength to strength' in speech .

The disgraced Methodist minister claimed an extraordinary £63,000 in expenses in just three years as a Labour councillor in Bradford.
Flowers sat on the national executive committee of the Co-op alongside three Labour MPs, two of whom – Chris Leslie and Cathy Jamieson – are members of Labour’s Treasury team.
Chancellor George Osborne announced an independent probe into the near collapse of the Co-op Bank which will cover the ‘appointment’ of senior staff.
Flowers’s solicitor said his client was in a ‘rather ponderous frame of mind’ and that police would be making ‘further inquiries’."

'She was told she was going to a restaurant but when she arrived it was a house with 16 girls staying on the second floor,' explains Cecilia. Some of the sex slave prisoners were younger than Maria at just 13 or 14-years-old.

Some of the men - who they say were American - demanded they perform sexual acts with men pulled off the street, drink their own urine and other even more degrading acts.

It looks like Leonard Lauder, the 80-year-old billionaire chairman of the cosmetics giant Estee Lauder, is officially back on the singles’ market. The wealthy octogenarian was due to marry his girlfriend Linda E. Johnson, 55, this past August, but the couple scrapped the planned nuptials just days before saying 'I do.' However, the two continued to be seen in public together and even went ahead with their trip to Sardinia, which was supposed to be their honeymoon. They're history: Leonard Lauder, the 80-year-old chairman of Estee Lauder, and his former fiancee Linda E. Johnson, pictured here in September, wrote in an email to friends that they decided to go their separate ways . On Tuesday, New York Post's gossip column Page Six reported that Lauder and Johnson sent their mutual friends a joint email announcing their split. 'We are afraid that we must cancel Sunday’s holiday party,' the missive cited by the Post read. 'Sadly, we have made the difficult but mutual decision to go our separate ways. 'We will remain friends and certainly cherish the time we spent together. We are so very sorry for the inconvenience and send you our warmest wishes... Best, Linda and Leonard.' Estee Lauder spokesperson Bari Seiden confirmed the separation to MailOnline in an email this afternoon. Mr Lauder is the firstborn son of Estee Lauder, who in 1935 co-founded a company along with her husband selling beauty products. His estimated net worth is currently $7.6billion, according to Forbes. Miss Johnson, a glamorous Philadelphia socialite and art collector, has been the president and CEO of Brooklyn Public Library since 2011. Lauder and Johnson were set to walk down the aisle in late August, but the intimate Philadelphia ceremony was called off at the last moment after the couple decided things were moving too fast. The couple had begun publicly dating in late 2012, just a year after Lauder had tragically lost his first wife Evelyn to ovarian cancer. They had been married for 52 years and had helped grow the family business together. Beginning of the end: Lauder and his Brooklyn Library boss girlfriend Linda Johnson called off their wedding in August but have gone on a honeymoon anyway . Lauder and Johnson were pictured attending several New York society events together last year and spent last New Year's Eve at the Metropolitan Opera Gala. In May, it was revealed that the couple were very happy and talking about marriage, news that caused much distress among aspiring socialites 'of a certain age'. Launder, the chairman emeritus of Estée Lauder Co., has been described as ‘New York’s most eligible bachelor.’ The couple had been planning to wed in Philadelphia in front of a small group of family and friends in the last week of August. Cancer campaigner: Leonard Lauder pictured with late wife Evelyn Lauder in 2009, who famously spearheaded the Breast Cancer Research Foundation's Pink Ribbon initiative . But the New York Post reported at the time that the couple had started calling guests just a few weeks prior to tell them that their big day was being ‘postponed.’ In late September, Lauder and Johnson were all smiles at the Metropolitan Opera's season opening production of Eugene Onegin. Then in October, the couple were photographed warmly embracing at the Whitney Gala. Leonard and Evelyn Lauder married in 1959 and had two sons together. She had also worked at the cosmetics giant and was especially famous for spearheading the Breast Cancer Research Foundation's Pink Ribbon initiative.

General Motors CEO Dan Akerson has announced that he will step down next month and be replaced by the first woman to run the storied car company. Mary Barra, a GM 'lifer' and the current global product chief, has been named as his successor in the landmark appointment. The new title bump for the married mother-of-two means that she will be the first woman to head a global car manufacturer. To insiders, her new role as CEO comes as part of a steady climb, as her father is a long-time GM employee and Barra has spent her entire 33-year career at the company. Scroll down for video . Mary Barra seen speaking at the final press preview day for the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan (pictured in January 2012) When she starts her new job on January . 15, she will lead a company that's made nearly $20billion since . emerging from bankruptcy in 2010, much of it from the cars and trucks . she helped develop. She . still faces challenges of paring down GM's costs and winning over buyers . in international markets such as India and South America. Akerson, 65, said he had planned to stay at least until spring, but his wife's advanced cancer diagnosis changed that. He . said the board unanimously picked Barra from several internal . candidates because of the breadth of her experience, her management . record, her people skills and her understanding of GM's operations. ‘This is an executive who has a vision of where she wants to take the organization,’ he said. Since . February 2011, Barra has held what many say is the most important job . at GM. She joined the company in 1980 as an engineering student at . Kettering - then known as General Motors Institute - and became a plant . manager, executive director of engineering and head of human resources. Mary Barra (pictured left in December 2013) will take over from Dan Akerson (pictured right) as General Motors' next CEO in January 2014 . Along . the way, she earned a reputation as a manager who made tough decisions, . yet was able to get people to follow her lead and work as a team, . according to current and former GM executives.

Gay couples who wed less than a week ago have had their marriages annulled after Australia's highest court struck down a law allowing the nation's first same-sex unions. The weddings were legalised in the capital Canberra on Saturday after regional authorities enacted a gay marriage law - but it was challenged by the government, which said it was invalid. Today the High Court of Australia agreed, shattering the dreams of more than a dozen couples who had already married this week. Tearful: Activist Rodney Croome with couples outside the High Court of Australia after a gay marriage law was struck down today. He said: 'marriage equality is not about protest or politics... it's about love' Devastated: Chris Teoh and Ivan Hinton had their wedding, pictured, on Saturday. It will now be annulled . Glenda and Jennifer Lloyd, pictured with their marriage certificate, had wed only days before the historic ruling . This couple, named as Krishna and Veronica, was one of dozens who attended the High Court ruling today . Australia's Prime Minister is against gay marriage and the national Marriage Act was amended in 2004 to define weddings as 'between a man and a . woman'. The government told the High Court that having different marriage laws in different states would cause confusion. The Australian Capital Territory, which passed the law in . October, said it should stand because it governs couples outside the . federal definition of marriage as being between members of the opposite . sex. Today the court sided with the government, saying the two laws could not run side-by-side. Ivan Hinton, who married his partner Chris Teoh on Saturday, had only received their marriage certificate . on Wednesday and had already applied to change their surnames to . Hinton-Teoh. Outside court he said he will always consider Teoh his husband and added: 'This was an unprecedented and historic opportunity. I wouldn't have missed it for the world.' Upset: A couple hug outside the court. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is against same-sex unions . Emotion: Couples embrace each other after the ruling, which defeated a regional law made in Capital Territory . Glenda and Jennifer Lloyd embraced as couples faced the media today outside the High Court of Australia . The court said in a statement: 'The Marriage Act does not now provide . for the formation or recognition of marriage between same sex couples. The Marriage Act provides that a marriage can be solemnised in Australia . only between a man and a woman. 'That Act is a comprehensive and exhaustive . statement of the law of marriage.' Rodney . Croome, national director of the advocacy group Australian Marriage . Equality, said his group knows of about 30 same-sex couples who have . married since Saturday, though the actual number may be slightly higher. Conservative: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is against gay marriage and blocked two bills . The court decision nullifies their marriages as it means . the local law under which they were wed was invalid. Outside the court in Canberra, a tearful Croome, flanked by several same-sex newlyweds, said the ruling was a defeat for marriage equality but there had been a 'greater victory'. 'That victory was the nation saw for the first time, I believe, what is really at the core of this issue,' he said. 'They've seen that marriage equality is not about protest or politics or even about laws in the constitution, ultimately. Marriage equality is about love, commitment, family and fairness.' The ruling has effectively barred any other Australian states from legalising same-sex marriage, and the decision can now only be taken by the government. However, Prime Minister Tony Abbott opposes gay . marriage and his coalition blocked two federal bills last year that . would have allowed legal recognition of same-sex partnerships. Lyle Shelton, managing director of Australian Christian Lobby, which opposes same-sex marriage, praised the court ruling and said common sense had prevailed. As for the ruling's impact on the newlywed couples, Shelton said it was 'really sad that they were put in a position' in which they were allowed to marry before the court handed down its judgment. The ruling comes a day after India's Supreme Court struck down a 2009 lower court decision to decriminalize homosexuality. The verdict to reinstate gay sex as an 'unnatural act' as part of a 153-year-old colonial law prompted dismay from human rights groups across the world, which condemned the ruling as 'medieval and regressive'. Homosexual acts in India, in many parts a deeply conservative country, are punishable with life in jail.","Nation's highest court quashes regional law approved just weeks ago .

A Mexican diplomat and his wife are being questioned by police after their four-month-old son died with cuts and bruises across his body, police said. Eduardo Rocha Bracamontes, 36, . and his wife, Gina Ximena, 26, took their unconscious baby son, Eduardo Rocha Ovalle, by taxi to a Manhattan hospital around 9pm on Tuesday night. The child was not breathing and was pronounced dead at NYU Langone Medical Center at 9.36pm. Staff contacted police. Authorities said an autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of the boy's death, but it has been deemed suspicious because of 'bruising on his hands, feet, back and genitalia'. The New York Daily News reported that the baby boy had a laceration to his scalp and cuts on his right thumb and a toe. Both of the parents are answering questions at the Midtown South Precinct, although police sources said that they have not given any explanation as to what had happened in their home. 'I can tell you that the parent, the . father is an employee of the Mexican consulate here in New York,' NYPD . Commissioner Ray Kelly said Wednesday. 'The . baby expired at the hospital.

Wanda Hernandez, 52, the super of the building where the family lived, told the New York Post that the couple had lived in the apartment for about a year but they they were behind on their rent. She added that the couple were planning to go back to Mexico on December 31. Hernandez said that when she left police into the apartment there was no visible signs of blood or violence. She added that around two months ago she found the mother on the door steps talking to a female officer, telling her: 'He grabbed me so hard, he shook me.' 'She was crying,' Hernandez told the Post. 'She told me her husband bruised her and she was showing me the bruises on her arm. She said he doesn’t want to give her the baby.' The couple was planning to go back to Mexico on Dec. 31st, Hernandez said.","Baby Eduardo Rocha Ovalle was pronounced dead at a Manhattan hospital on Tuesday night after he was rushed there by his parents .

Former gynecologist Bruce Sylvester Smith was finally sentenced to 18 years in prison on Tuesday for raping a pregnant patient while performing an exam on her in his office in Chicago's South Side in 2002 following a bungled investigation. The victim, who was eight months pregnant at the time and cannot be identified, struggled as she explained the attack while taking to the witness stand, saying that even though it happened 11 years ago, she has never gotten over the pain. She was lying on an examination table with her legs in stirrups on August 2, 2002, when Smith, 60, grabbed her legs and penetrated her, according to CBS. 'How do I describe the feeling of nasty and dirty, never being able to wash that feeling away, never being able to wash him away?' she told the court. Bruce Sylvester Smith has finally been sentenced to 18 years prison for raping a patient during an exam at his Chicago office in 2002 following a bungled investigation . 'It's like an endless knot in the pit of my belly that never goes away. 'It never goes away. 'I am afraid and paranoid all the time . 'I am afraid to be seen by a doctor, not just men (but) women too.' 'I put the health and care of myself and the health and care of my unborn child in his hands, but he violated that trust and he abused his position. 'He violated me in the worst way possible.' The prosecution called Smith 'despicable' and 'a liar' after he testified the sex was consensual. 'He blamed her for it,' Assistant State’s Attorney Annette Milleville said. 'He shattered (her trust) into a million pieces in the most despicable manner.' Although the rape took place well over a decade ago, Smith wasn’t arrested for crime until 2010, with prosecutors forced to admit 'mistakes were made' in their investigation. The woman, a teaching assistant, immediately called her sister after the attack, who contacted a rape hotline. At a counselor's urging, the woman underwent a rape exam at the University of Chicago Hospital on the day of the assault. Days later she filed a complaint with Chicago police. However the prosecutor who initially reviewed the case in 2002 declined to press charges pending further evidence. The case was later closed and the rape kit sat untested for years. Then in 2009 Smith’s medical license was suspended for nine months after several women came forward, accusing him of sexual misconduct. As the stories and allegations against Smith started to multiply, with numerous being documented by The Chicago Tribune, a detective sent the kit to a lab. The results matched DNA to Smith. Smith was never charged in any other case, although there were many. One former patient who went public with her allegations against Smith said he raped her during a pelvic exam in 2000 when she was 19 and her legs were in stirrups. Tameka Stokes said she broke down crying as she left the exam room and a nurse immediately called police. A rape exam did not turn up Smith's semen and prosecutors declined to press charges. 'You go into the doctor trusting them, thinking they'll do the right thing for you and you come out feeling humiliated like that's been taken away from you,' Stokes told authorities during a 2008 state hearing. Smith chose not to say anything in court before he was sentenced. But Assistant Public Defender Armando Sandoval spoke on Smith’s behalf describing how the father of five grew up poor and enlisted in the U.S. Army and worked as a teacher before putting himself through medical school. Because of his legal troubles, Smith’s second marriage ended, Sandoval told the judge in hopes of Smith avoiding the maximum 30-year sentence. He was sentenced to 18 years prison.","Bruce Sylvester Smith, 60, was spared the maximum penalty of 30 years for his crime and sentenced to 18 years prison .

The Red Lobster customer accused of writing 'none n*****' on the tip line of his check is so confident he didn't make the slur that he hired a forensics expert to evaluate his handwriting. The forensics expert evaluated both 20-year-old Devin Barnes' handwriting and that of his wife and concluded: 'There is evidence to indicate that Devin Barnes did not write the total entry. No significant handwriting characteristic similarities were noted.' Now Mr Barnes and his wife plan on taking legal action against the chain, after receiving numerous death threats when the photo went viral. Scroll down for Video . Not guilty: Devin Barnes, 20, says he didn't write the n-word on his Red Lobster check and he's got a forensic expert's opinion to back him up . Bad tipper: A forensics expert compared the writing on the total line with a sample of both Mr Barnes and his wife's handwriting and ruled that there were no similarities . 'A lot of people on the Internet who I don't know are calling me a racist and I'm thinking people have their own opinion but I know I am not a racist. I don't see color. I have many mixed color friends,' he told WATE. The photo was posted last month by 19-year-old Red Lobster waitress Christina Jenkins. 'This is what I got as a tip last night...so happy to live in the proud southern states...God Bless America, land of the free and home of the low class racists of Tennessee,' she wrote on her Facebook page.

Apology: Mr Barnes wrote a note saying he was sorry for the incident, but admitted that it wasn't him that wrote 'n*****' on the check . 'They were extremely rude, but I introduced myself to them and they didn't respond. When I came to take their order they simply told me they wanted their food and to put everything in a to-go box. I offered them dessert but they told me abruptly that they just wanted the check. 'When I went back to the table they had gone and left the receipt and had written in the comments.' While Mr Barnes admits that he didn't tip Miss Jenkins, he says it wasn't him that wrote the slur. He explains that the couple asked for their meal to go after getting a call about a family emergency. Miss Jenkins said she believes him and posted the picture to make a comment about racism, not to draw attention to herself. 'I know I didn't write it. If he's claiming he didn't write it, I believe him wholeheartedly. I'm just that kind of person. I have nothing against him or his family,' Miss Jenkins said. After hearing that Mr Barnes denied writing the n-word on his check, Miss Jenkins said that she believes him wholeheartedly. She says she posted the check on her Facebook to make a statement about racism, not draw attention to herself . Mr Barnes holds no grudge against Miss Jenkins. 'I'm not mad. I just didn't like what happened. I just wish it didn't come out this way,' Mr Barnes told WSMV.

The captain of the Bloomfield High School football team,  who is on trial for the murder of a 27-year-old with whom he had been having a sexual relationship, claims to have been sexually and physically assaulted by the man in the past. Tarence Mitchell, 18, of Bloomfield, Connecticut, has admitted to stabbing Ronald Taylor Jr - known as 'City' - five times in the torso with a steak knife out the front of his home on November 21, after trying to break off their two-year relationship. The athlete was recently released from jail and placed under house arrest after his mother posted his $1 million bail with the help of a bail bondsman. In a 20-page document filed to the Superior Court, Mitchell's lawyer Morgan P. Rueckert, said his client's admission to police supports a their defense that Mitchell was defending himself and didn't intend to kill Taylor, according to Courant. Tarence Mitchell, a star Connecticut high school football player, was trying to break it off with his older lover when he stabbed the man to death during a tussle outside the teen's home, cops say . Scene: The fight between Tarence Mitchell and his alleged lover Ronald Taylor Jr occurred out front of Mitchell's home at Hill Farm Rd, Bloomfield, on Nov. 21. Mitchell now claims Taylor physically and sexually assaulted him . Tarence Mitchell was straight after the stabbing of Ronald Taylor on Nov. 21. During an interview with police that night, he admitted to the crime and is claiming self defense due to an abusive relationship . However Judge Joan Alexander questioned . the self-defense suggestion during Mitchell's court appearance and noted . that Mitchell initially lied about what had happened, blaming . unidentified people wearing hoodies for the stabbing. In his motion, Rueckert wrote that Taylor, 'an adult, provided drugs to and sexually assaulted the defendant when he was a minor, and then attempted to use the threat of disclosing the defendant's past victimization, along with the threat of, and actual, physical violence to force the defendant to engage in sexual contact'. The assault was not elaborated further. Taylor had posted on Facebook that Mitchell was a 'Bloomfield gay football player', Mitchell told police. He said Taylor left the post up for five hours before deleting it but later threatened to post it again if Mitchell didn't stop distancing himself from him. Mitchell just wanted to be friends with Taylor, but Taylor 'wanted more than that and wanted to have a relationship with him,' the court report says. The day of the stabbing, Taylor texted Mitchell and told him that he was coming over that night and that 'it wasn't going to end well'. Mitchell put a steak knife in his right front pants pocket, he told police, fearing Taylor was going to do something 'outrageous'. The family of Tarence Mitchell, 18, recently posted his $1 million bail so he could 'fight this battle from home' Neighbors in the Bloomfield street reported hearing noises of running and 'two boys fighting' Mitchell has no prior convictions and doesn't suffer from any mental illness, the court heard, but 'he's extremely confused and upset' about Taylor's murder . He got into the front passenger seat of Taylor's car, and Taylor asked to see his cell phone. Taylor became jealous that Mitchell had sent cheerful text messages to girls, the report says. Taylor . started to yell at Mitchell and positioned his pointer and middle . fingers like a gun, the report says. He started 'mushing' the side of . Mitchell's head, Mitchell told police. Taylor hit Mitchell in the face, and Mitchell pulled the knife out of his pocket and stabbed Taylor twice, he told police. Taylor . climbed over him, and Mitchell stabbed him as he did, the report says. Taylor opened the passenger side door and started running away. Mitchell . started chasing Taylor, who said, 'I take it back, I take it back. I . didn't mean to do this,' Mitchell told investigators. They . ran into the front yard of a neighboring house at 27 Hill Farm Road, . and Taylor turned toward him and held his hands up in the air. Mitchell stabbed him again, according to the report. Taylor fell, got up and ran again, this time into Mitchell's front yard at 24 Hill Farm Road. Mitchell followed him again, he told police, and stabbed him one last time — five times total, the report says. Tarence Mitchell is a star footballer who is described as 'a great kid' who is 'loved by all the town' An ambulance transported Taylor to Saint Francis Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. According . to court documents, Mitchell first lied to police about the stabbing, . claiming both he and Taylor were attacked by two men. On his Facebook page, Mitchell is listed as 'interested in women'. Police set bond initially at $500,000 but then upped it to $1 million. Mitchell has no arrest history. Mitchell's mother, Tyra Smith, defended her son, saying 'he's never been in trouble'. 'He's a star athlete, he’s loved all around town, everybody knows him. 'This is just so shocking. 'I send my deepest condolences to the victim’s family but my son is not a murderer.' After posting his bail, Smith said she was happy to have her son back. 'We have a long road, but I would rather he fight from home than in prison,' she told reporters outside court.

George Zimmerman has avoided domestic violence charges stemming from a bust-up with his girlfriend after she said in a sworn statement that she does not want to pursue the case. Samantha Scheibe's decision not to cooperate and the lack of other corroborating evidence made it unlikely the prosecution would succeed, State Attorney Phil Archer said on Wednesday. Zimmerman had faced charges of aggravated assault, battery and criminal mischief following an incident at the central Florida house he shared with Scheibe on November 18. She initially told police Zimmerman pointed a shotgun at her face and smashed up her items, and called 911 saying that she feared for her life. Scroll down to listen to original 911 call . No charges: George Zimmerman, pictured in November, will not be charged in a recent domestic dispute with his girlfriend in which she claimed he brandished a gun at her and smashed a table . But she then recanted in an affidavit filed this week, stating: 'I do not want George Zimmerman charged... I make this decision freely, knowingly and voluntarily, and without coercion' Zimmerman, 30, had been barred from seeing or contacting the 27-year-old blonde after he posted $9,000 bond. He was also forced to give up his guns and wear a GPS monitor. Her affidavit gave a starkly different account of events to Scheibe's original 911 call. On the day of the argument, she clearly told a dispatcher Zimmerman was . brandishing a weapon at her, had smashed her glass table with it and then locked her out of her home. 'He's . in my house, breaking all my s--- because I asked him to leave,' Scheibe told the operator. 'He's got a freaking gun, breaking all my . stuff right now.' She is also heard screaming at Zimmerman: 'You put your gun in my freakin' face... Get out of my house. Do not push me out of my house. Please get out of my house.' Companion: . Scheibe reportedly told Zimmerman she was six weeks pregnant but he told her he was leaving . Argument: Zimmerman, pictured leaving jail, may or may not have pointed a shotgun at his girlfriend who had been feeling increasingly scared of him . Scheibe later opened up about the couple's volatile relationship in an . interview where she detailed Zimmerman's intense depression since he was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin. However, in late November, sources close to . Zimmerman claimed Scheibe had made up the incident after allegedly . faking a pregnancy in a failed bid to stop him leaving her. Zimmerman began dating Scheibe after she apparently consoled him following his break up with wife, Shellie. After . Shellie filed for divorce, Zimmerman moved into Scheibe's Seminole . County home but, according to her, their relationship soon fell apart . because of his depression. In an interview, she said she helped him after he spiraled into a very dark place and tried . to kill himself multiple times, once putting a gun in his mouth and . threatening to pull the trigger. Scheibe described how he spent days in bed, refusing to get up. One . day she found him passed out with an empty bottle of sleeping pills on . his side table. She claims he overdosed and she wasn't able to revive him . but noticed he was still breathing. Who is the liar: Scheibe, pictured, sounded genuinely scared on the 911 call on the day of the argument . When he did wake, she said he started crying and then put a gun inside his mouth, telling her he was ready to end it all. She said she talked him out of killing himself. According . to Scheibe, Zimmerman enjoyed the media attention he received from the . Trayvon case and grew depressed when he wasn't in the headlines. In . late October, she demanded he get professional help but she said this . made him angry and he moved all her furniture, clothes and food out of . her home. They later made up and he moved her things back into the house.

The U.S. Mega Millions jackpot grew to an estimated $400 million for the next draw on Friday after no one won the top prize of $344 million on Tuesday evening, lottery organizers said. The next draw is slated for Friday, December 13 - considered an unlucky date by some - at 11 p.m. E.T. (0400 GMT Saturday). If the winner chose to take a cash prize instead of an annuity, it would amount to $216 million, according to Mega Millions officials. Jackpot! This Friday's jackpot is likely to hit the $400 million mark. Will you be lucky on Friday 13th? Up for grabs: No one matched the numbers of 5, 12, 22, 41, 65 and the Mega Ball 13, meaning the jackpot will continue to roll . Pay to play: The Mega Millions is played in 43 states and only costs $1 per ticket. Whatta deal! Source: The Daily Beast . Tuesday's top prize had a cash payout . option of $184 million, according to the lottery, which is played in a . majority of U.S. states. The winning numbers from that drawing were: 5, . 12, 22, 41, 65 and 13, Mega Millions said. No . one has won the jackpot in more than two months, pushing the purse . steadily higher, although it remains well below the record-setting $656 . million won on March 30, 2012. The next largest prizes in the 17-year history of Mega Millions were worth $390 million and $380 million. Five tickets worth $1 million were sold in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut and Ohio. Those tickets matched the first five numbers. There’s no word which stores sold those tickets. It could be you: But then again, it probably won't be! To win, you need to match six numbers -- five from 1 to 75 and one from 1 to 15. In . addition to the jackpot, there are eight other winning combinations for . prizes, of $1, $2, $5, $50, $500, $5,000 and $1 million. If one ticket matches all six numbers for the $400 million mega-jackpot, the winner will have the choice of receiving the full jackpot in 30 annual payments, or a cash option of approximately $216.4 million before taxes. 'The strong sales of Mega Millions tickets mean more than just an exciting jackpot,' said Paula Otto, executive director of the Virginia Lottery and lead director for the Mega Millions group. 'They mean greater profits to benefit each state in which Mega Millions is played.' Friday's jackpot has been growing since October 1st, when Mega Millions had its most recent jackpot winner. The jackpot has now rolled 20 times without a winner. Feeling lucky: Victoria Vazquez displays $280 worth of Mega Millions lottery tickets for her office pool that she purchased at Liquorland in Covina, California . This is the largest jackpot since . changes were made to Mega Millions that include larger starting . jackpots, a million-dollar second prize, and a new matrix of 1-75 for . the first five numbers and 1-15 for the Mega Ball number. One thing that did not change is the price of a Mega Millions ticket: still $1. The . odds of winning the jackpot are approximately one in 259 million. The . odds of winning any of the Mega Millions prizes are approximately 1 in . 15. Mega Millions . holds the record for the largest jackpot ever, at $656 million. That . jackpot on March 30, 2012, was split by three winning tickets in . Illinois, Kansas and Maryland. The . average American is more likely to be killed in a mass murder than win . the jackpot. Fifty three times more likely, in fact. Dying in an . avalanche sometime in the next decade is 160 times more likely than . winning. Unfortunately, not all Americans have a chance of winning the biggest jackpot in history as Mega Millions is only played in 43 states. However residents in other non-playing . states can purchase tickets in the states they are sold in as there is . no residency requirement to play and win. Big money:  Cashier Abdulwali Mohamed Osaim sells a  Mega Millions . lottery tickets at a convenience store on the east side of Manhattan . Even non U.S. citizens are allowed to play, but the tax they would have to pay on winnings is different. At 173-million-to-one, the odds of . scoring the largest lottery win in US history are so long they're . literally unfathomable. And mathematicians say there's no way to improve . them - except by buying more tickets. In theory, with such a massive jackpot would be possible to 'invest' $173 million to play every number combination and then rake in $560 million in winnings. What would you do with $400 million? There's only one way to find out and that's by filling out the numbers . That is, at $1 a ticket, and 173 million . possible combinations, you could play every number and increase the . odds of winning to 100 percent and rake in more than 320 percent profit. (Though, that begs the question: 'If you've got $173 million laying . around, why are you playing the lottery?') A lot of lottery players are superstitious and buying tickets on Friday 13th may believe their luck is cursed from the start. But Matthew Vea, a computer programmer who developed a computer analysis to track Mega Millions winning numbers since 2005, said he has found no pattern - though higher numbers tend to be picked more often.

That means, at least in theory, no number combination is more likely to be selected than any other.

The daughter of a Sandy Hook hero has opened up about the prominent role her deceased mother played in her summer wedding, down to choosing the dress she wore. Erica Lafferty, one of Sandy Hook principle Dawn Hochsprung daughters, spoke in her first televised interview since marrying July 6 in an emotional day dedicated to her mother. The still-grieving daughter Monday evening told CNN's Piers Morgan the ceremony went exactly the way that her mother wanted it. 'Exactly the way she wanted': Erica Lafferty says her wedding went exactly as she and her mother planned it . 'I got married in the dress that my mom . and I picked out, at her house in the Adirondacks, in the shoes that she . would have tormented me for wearing,' she said with a grin. 'We had almost the entire wedding planned together and I did it exactly the way that she wanted it to be,' Ms Lafferty continued. Ms Lafferty was married to long-time fiance Christopher Smegielski only seven months after the horrific Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting spree that claimed her mother's life. ""I knew that day would have been perfect for her, it was perfect for me,' Ms Lafferty explained. 'It was perfect for my husband. And I knew she was with me.' 'She lets me know it's worth it': Ms Lafferty also explained that every time she feels like giving up the gun control fight, her mother reminds her to keep at it . Ms Lafferty, who has become a staunch gun control advocate in the year since deranged gunman Adam Lanza killed 28 people, including 20 first-grade students, his own mother and Ms Hochsprung, also revealed her emotions during the her visit to her mother's grave. 'I was able to go to the cemetery to be with her that morning,' she said, 'only for a couple minutes because I knew I had to get out quick so I didn't completely lose it and ruin my day.' 'I think it's exactly the day she would have wanted me to have.' She also spoke of how she believes her mother finds ways to inspire her when she feels like no longer fighting for stronger gun controls as the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting approaches. 'Every time I'm ready to give up, a school bus will drive by, or I'll be standing outside... and my wind chimes will go off,' Ms Lafferty told Mr Morgan. 'I'll see a butterfly in the blistering cold, or Harriet the spy will fall off my bookshelf, she lets me know that it's all worth it.'

Ms Lafferty, 27, has spoken previously about the wedding, but her appearance this week on CNN's 'Piers Morgan Live' was her first televised interview since the wedding. She made a morning stop at her . mother’s grave- wedding dress and all- to make sure the heroic woman . had her place on the special day . ‘I wanted to let her know how much I missed her,' Ms Lafferty told People Magazine. ‘No daughter should ever have to do that on her wedding day.’ Ms Lafferty posted a picture of the tender moment to her personal Twitter page, with the poignant caption: 'I love you, Mommy'. Planning the wedding was one of the last things the two women did before the horrific December 2012 shooting that claimed Ms Hochsprung’s life, along with dozens of others. The heroic woman is credited with saving the . lives of countless children and teachers by confronting the gunman and . broadcasting their interaction over the school announcement system so . that everyone in the building could hear it and use the time to hide. ‘Never in a million years did I think I would be getting married without my mother there. Planning for my wedding was actually one of the last things my mom and I did together before she was killed,’ Ms Lafferty told the magazine. Ms Lafferty and longtime fiance Christopher Smegielski were married at Ms Hochsprung’s upstate New York lake house in the Adirondacks. Happy birthday: Erica Lafferty left this sign at her mother Dawn Hochsprung's grave July 1 . As a tribute to her mother, Ms Lafferty wore custom sneakers as part of her bridal ensemble. ‘My mom always teased me because I was such a tomboy,"" she told People. ‘When I was picking out my dress, we found you could custom Converse sneakers, so she knew I had ordered them.’ The recently-married Ms Lafferty also shared that she finds a way to keep her mother part of every single day. Just days before the wedding, she posted a picture of a sign she left at her mother’s grave. Mr Smegielski stood by Ms Lafferty during a number of interviews immediately following the December 14 tragedy. In a segment for The Today Show, he said: 'For some reason Dawn loved me and it's my job now to be there for her daughter'. Better times: Dawn Hochsprung (L) and daughter Erin Lafferty (R) pictured before the Sandy Hook principle's death last year . 'I accept that job with open arms and I'll be there for her in any way possible,' he said. Ms Lafferty added that she was finding it 'tough' after her mother's death. 'I had a really hard time not being mad about it but that's who she was,' she said. 'She faced every single problem that she ever had in her life head on. 'My cousin referred to her as a 'bull' yesterday. There's no stopping Dawn when she has a mission. She gets it done and she gives it everything she has.'

Armstrong Desvallons, of Terrytown, learned his fate Tuesday after admitting that he practiced WWE-style moves on 5-year-old Viloude Louis while babysitting her in June. The toddler died from internal bleeding and lacerations to her liver after being body-slammed and elbowed in the chest about 20 times by her older half-brother, according to prosecutors. Justice: Viloude Louis' stepbrother Armstrong Desvallons was sentenced to three years in a juvenile center for the June death of the 5-year-old girl . Desvallons pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in November. He is expected to get psychological treatment and education programming while staying at the secure facility. He could be released earlier than three years depending on his progress. During his sentencing at Jefferson Parish Juvenile Court, members of the Marrero Seventh-Day Adventist Church where the Desvallons family worshiped described the 13-year-old as a good kid and asked the judge to release him into their probationary custody. However, Armstrong's own stepfather, Vilger Louis, insisted that he was disrespectful and would repeat the actions that resulted in his sister’s death given the chance. 'I don’t think you are going to give Armstrong license to go out there and kill somebody again,' Mr Louis, who was Viloude's biological father, told the judge, according to The Advocate. Allourdes Desvallons, the boy's mother, told Judge Andrea Janzen that little Viloude was 'very special' to her. 'What he [Armstrong] did, it's like he ended my life,' Mrs Desvallons told Janzen. 'What the judge would decide, I would comply.' WWE also weighed in on the judge’s decision, according to NOLA.com, saying in a statement that the wrestling organization supports the ruling that Armstrong ‘absolutely knew that he was hurting his 5-year-old little sister.' 'Therefore, it is illogical to conclude that the brutal and ultimately fatal beating of a 5-year-old little girl by a teenager could be confused with imitation of WWE moves seen on TV.' The statement read. Viloude Louis died from the brutal beating June 16 in Terrytown. Armstrong had originally been charged . with manslaughter, but took a plea deal at the trial in Jefferson Parish . Juvenile Court last month return for the less serious charge. Tragic: Viloude Louis died from a brutal beating meted out to her by her step-brother, who pleaded guilty to a charge of negligent homicide last month . The . plea deal came after Judge Janzen deemed his interview with detectives after the . death as inadmissible because neither he nor his mother, who attended, . would have understood the legal obligations of what was happening. He . wrote a statement in court confessing that he played with Viloude ‘in a bad way’ and hit her on the back and stomach 15 to 20 times. He also admitted using ‘body slams’ that he’d seen pro-wrestlers John Cena and Mark Henry perform. The little girl had suffered broken ribs, internal bleeding and a lacerated liver. The . teenager told officers . after his arrest that their mother was out of the house when the incident took place. Paramedics found the girl unresponsive and she was pronounced dead a short time later. Scene: The little girl suffered the beating in this Louisiana neighborhood while her half-brother babysat her . Armstrong was arrested after a coroner investigation found the girl died of multiple injuries two days after the death. Her brother had initially told investigators the girl had a stomach ache and went upstairs to . brush her teeth, and 30 minutes later he found her on the floor . complaining her stomach still hurt, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's spokesman . Col. John Fortunato said. The . teenager claimed he took the girl downstairs to the sofa and called 911 . when he saw she was no longer breathing. Dispatchers told him to start .

The skies of Arizona were lit up on Tuesday as a large meteor exploded across the night. The large rock, which was described by witnesses as having a slightly orange bright glow, exploded in the sky, rattling houses in Tucson, causing some concern among residents, who flood local TV stations with worried. 'We were eating dinner and heard a good bang that rattled the roof of our house,'  Astronomer Tod Lauer posted to Facebook, CNN reported. Scroll down for video . Arizona residents reported hearing a 'large bang' on Tuesday night - raising concerns for many - before a bright white meteor shot across the sky, similiar to this stock image. Scientists are trying to work out whether it landed . Social media also erupted, with hundreds of people from Las Vegas to Tucson reporting a bright object streaking across the horizon. Scientists are now trying to work if and where the meteor landed so it can be examined. Mesa resident John Duhigg captured the event on the dash cam in his car. In the video, which was posted to YouTube, Duhigg said he was driving near the Phoenix Mesa Gateway Airway around 7:11 pm. ABC15 Chief Meteorologist Amber Sullins said the meteor was likely part of a rare outburst of the Andromedids meteor shower. The Andromedids are showers that occur, usually around November, as the Earth passes through old streams of the comet 3D/Biela. The explosion also shook the house of Tony Kubrak, who told CNN he went outside to see what the commotion was. 'I see this tremendous, white, bright light in the western sky,' he said. 'And it was just ... it was absolutely enormous, I couldn't believe it.' The sighting comes a few days out from the annual Geminid meteor, which officially starts Thursday. It carries a maximum of 100 to 120 meteors per hour at its peak, which is expected to happen Friday night. ASA has said this years Geminid will be 'rich in fire balls'. They can be viewed best from 11 pm to 3 am ET. 'Of all the debris streams Earth passes through every year, the Geminids are by far the most massive,' said NASA astronomer Bill Cooke. 'When we add up the amount of dust in the Geminid stream, it outweighs other streams by factors of 5 to 500.' NASA calls it the' 900-pound gorilla of meteor showers'. Most meteor showers are caused by comets, but not Geminid, which contains the name of the constellation Gemini. A large space rock called 3200 Pheathon flings the debris that makes the sparkling storm in the sky.

A New Mexico father is fighting the state of Utah for his daughter that was given up in 2008 for adoption without his consent. Robert Manzanares, 36, of Las Cruces, is in Colorado for a three-day juvenile court hearing that will determine the fate of daughter Kaia – he wants sole custody, the adoptive parents want a joint agreement. The case is in a Colorado court because he filed an injunction there before the baby was born in Utah. He wants his daughter back: Robert Manzanares is in court this week to determine who will get custody of his daughter . The joint custody agreement proposed by . the adoptive parents, who are related to the six-year-old girl’s . biological mother, treats Mr Manzanares ‘like a divorced, out-of-state . father with visitation rights,’ he told the Salt Lake Tribune. Mr Manzanares has been fighting for custody of his daughter since before she was born, he filed a court injunction while the mother was still pregnant after he learned of her plans to give the baby up for adoption. She traveled to Utah just before the young girl was born in 2008. She is accused by Mr Manzanares of giving birth in the state to circumvent his filing for custody so she could give the baby to relatives. ‘It’s just unbelievable that it can take a father five years to gain visitation, much less six years to get to who has the right to raise his child,’ he told the paper. ‘Constitutionally [I] should have every right to raise [my] child,’ he added. Mr Manzanares isn't opposed to having the adoptive parents in Kaia's life, but he wants full custody of his daughter. 'I want to to live with you': Kaia did not want to go back to the Utah couple raising her, Mr Manzanares claims . A Colorado court ruling in January of last year sided with Mr Manzanares’ contention that he was improperly barred from intervening to gain custody of his daughter. He has been gradually reintroduced into his daughter’s life during visits to Utah in the time since that ruling. She even spent an extended period of time with him in New Mexico. ‘The visit to NM was very successful and Kaia was so happy to meet a lot more of her family and to bond with her step sisters and brother,’ he posted on Facebook shortly after she left. ‘She said, ‘I want to live with you… my other family is not my real family only you are, why do I have to live with them?’ He said she asked, before adding that it broke his heart, but had to let the court process play out. Subsequent postings had Mr Manzanares . saying he had nothing but the best interests of his daughter at heart, . and that the adoptive parents even tried to bully him into paying child . support. ‘They messed with the wrong father,’ he wrote. 'THey messed with the wrong father': Mr Manzanares has vowed to fight for as long as it takes to gain custody of daughter Kaia . Lawyers for both sides declined to speak to the Tribune and were unable to be reached by MailOnline because they are in court. This case echoes a number of others recently that have garnered national attention as fathers fight to gain custody of children given up for adoption without their consent. The most recent involves 19-year-old Preston King, who is fighting for custody of son Wyatt after the child's teen mother put her up for adoption when she couldn't afford to raise him. This case has yet to be decided. The most famous case involves 'baby Veronica,' whose soldier father waged a custody war with her adoptive parents that saw the girl shuttled between Kansas and South Carolina multiple times. He was almost arrested for refusing to hand her back to her adoptive parents after a court ruled he must, and then famously ended the custody battle in a teary-eyed press conference.","The girl's biological mother gave birth and handed the baby to family members for adoption without father Robert Manzanares' consent .

A Fox News presenter yesterday launched a live tirade against a secular seasonal display set to be erected next to a Christmas display at a state Capitol building. Florida governor Rick Scott's office last week gave the green light to proposals to install a Festivus pole made of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer cans next to a nativity display. Festivus is a well-celebrated parody alternative to Christmas popularised by the Nineties sitcom Seinfeld and invented by the family of one of its scriptwriters. Scroll down for video . 'Outraged': Fox News host Gretchen Carlson launched an outspoken tirade against the plans for a Festivus pole outside Florida's capital building during a broadcast alongside religious experts on the network yesterday . The holiday, which has evolved into a form of playful resistance to the commercialisation of Christmas, involves an unadorned aluminium 'Festivus pole' in place of a tree, as well as farcical traditions such as the 'Airing of Grievances' and the 'Feats of Strength'. However, the joke was lost on Fox host Gretchen Carlson, who pronounced herself 'outraged' during a broadcast alongside Catholic League president Bill Donohue yesterday. 'Why do I have to drive around with my kids to look for a nativity scenes and be, like, ""Oh, yeah, kids, look, there’s baby Jesus behind the Festivus pole made out of beer cans!"" It’s nuts! Mr Donohue chimed in: 'We don’t have . to have the Klan out there on Martin Luther King Day with their . monuments right next to a bust of Martin Luther King. Festivus pole: Festivus is a well-celebrated parody alternative to Christmas popularised by the Nineties sitcom Seinfeld that has become widely accepted . 'We don’t want to have neo-Nazis out there to stick it to Jews on Yom Kippur. And we shouldn’t have people out there ready to trash Christianity given that proximity. 'Let them do it some other time and some other place.' But David Silverman, president of American Atheists, who was also part of the panel discussion, defended the idea of a public display of secularism so close to Christmas. 'The season doesn't belong to Christianity, the season belongs to everyone,' he said. 'Christianity stole the season from the Solstice.' He added: 'There is no wrong way to celebrate the season, it belongs to all of us. I say it’s much better without religion. Dump the church, you don’t like it anyway. Happy Festivus! For all of us!' The row over Festivus marks a coming of age for the parody winter festival, which first entered popular culture after it was made the focus of a 1997 episode of Seinfeld. It had its genesis in the family of Dan O'Keefe, a writer for the long-running sitcom, whose father Daniel Lawrence O'Keefe, a Reader's Digest editor, invented it in 1966 to commemorate he and his wife's first date. That was a date in February, however in the original O'Keefe family tradition, the holiday would take place in response to family tension, 'any time from December to May.' After a rapid rise in popularity, these days Festivus is celebrated on December 23 as a parody alternative to Christmas. In 2005, Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle was declared 'Governor Festivus' and during the holiday season displayed a Festivus Pole in the family room of the Executive Residence in Madison, Wisconsin.","Florida governor approved plans for Festivus pole outside state Capitol .

The sword-wielding diner left the restaurant by the time a chef came out to talk to him, but then returned to shout death threats while carrying the sword. ‘Mr. Kramer was yelling that he wanted his free tacos or somebody was going to die,’ the affadvit said. The quick-thinking waitress may have saved at least her own life by locking the door before he reached it, officials said.

Millennial women in America are more likely to receive pay nearly equal to their male counterparts than any previous generation. A Pew Research study out Wednesday shows that the working women of Generation Y bring home around 93 percent of the earnings of men. But even as the wage gap closes, women aged 18 to 32 remain as pessimistic as their mothers and grandmothers regarding gender equality. Closing the gap? A new Pew study out Wednesday found that Millennial women are more likely to receive pay nearly equal to their male counterparts than any generation before . Overall, women earned just 84 percent of what men were paid in 2012 according to the Pew study. Though . the younger generation is more fortunate after decades of women’s . demands for equal pay, 75 percent of women 18-32 still say the U.S. needs to do more to bring about equality in the workplace. Some 57 percent of young men answered the same way. While . women under 32 now have higher rates of college completion than men . that age, the analysis of census and labor data shows their hourly . earnings will slip further behind by the women's mid-30s, if the . experience of the past three decades is a guide. Narrower, but still there: Pew's research shows that women 25 to 34 make 93 percent of what their male counterparts take home. Compare that to the 84 percent that woman make versus men overall . That widening gap is due in part to . the many women who take time off or reduce their hours to start . families. Other factors cited in the report are gender stereotyping, . discrimination, weaker professional networks and women's hesitancy to . aggressively push for raises and promotions, which together may account . for 20 to 40 percent of the pay gap. Even so, just 15 percent of young women say they have been discriminated against because of their gender. ‘Today's . generation of young women is entering the labor force near parity with . men in terms of earnings and extremely well prepared in terms of their . educational attainment,’ said Kim Parker, associate director with the . Pew Social & Demographic Trends Project. ‘They feel empowered in . many ways, yet when they look at the workplace, they see it as a 'man's . world' with the deck stacked against them.’ ‘They . think that men earn more than women for doing the same job and that . it's easier for men to get top executive jobs than it is for women,’ she . said. Women are . increasingly moving into higher career positions both in government and . business. They make up nearly half the workforce, and the share of women . in managerial and administrative occupations is nearly equal to that of . men — 15 percent compared to 17 percent. Not out of the woods: Despite the great strides made in closing the pay gap, even Millennial women continue to be skeptical about gender equality in America--nearly as skeptical as their mothers and grandmothers . Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor . at Johns Hopkins University, attributed young women's negative . assessments about gender equality to their rising career expectations. ‘More doors are now open to women, but they can now see how far they are . from equality in high-level jobs,’ he said. The . near-equal pay for young women is being driven in large part by their . educational gains. Some 38 percent of women ages 25-32 now hold . bachelor's degrees, compared to 31 percent of young men. As a result, 49 . percent of employed workers with at least a bachelor's degree last year . were women, up from 36 percent in 1980. That means more women in . higher-skilled, higher-paying positions. The . current ratio of hourly earnings for young women to young men, now at . 93 percent, is up from 67 percent in 1980 and is the highest in . government records dating back to at least 1979. Across all age groups, . the median hourly wage for women last year was 84 percent as much as men . — $14.90 vs. $17.79, up from 64 percent in 1980. At . the same time, the Pew study indicates that a woman's job advancement . often will hit a ceiling, due in part to competing demands of work and . family. Women remain twice as likely as men to work part-time and are . more likely to take significant time off from employment during their . lives to care for children or other family members. Still skeptical: While the wages are going up for Millennial women, the Pew study shows that 75 percent of women aged 18-32 think more should be done to bring about gender equality. In Boomer generation women, the number was only slightly higher . Among young women, 59 percent say that being a working parent makes it harder to advance in a job or career, compared to just 19 percent of young men. Across all age groups, 22 percent of women and 9 percent of men report having quit jobs for family reasons at some point during their working lives. Fewer young women than young men aspire to become a boss or top manager. Some 34 percent say they're not interested, compared to 24 percent of young men. And the vast majority of adults of all ages who reduced their work hours to care for family members — 94 percent — say they are glad they did it. ‘This report shows that we are still very much in a 'stalled revolution' when it comes to gender equality in the workplace — and young women see it,’ said Pamela Smock, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan. ‘When we see our male CEOs taking off a day to care for a sick child, then we will be working in a more gender-equal workplace — and a more gender-equal world.’ The Pew study was based on interviews with 2,002 adults by cellphone or landline from October 7 to October 27. The Pew poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.","Pew Research has found that Generation Y women make 93 percent as much as their male counterparts .

A combination of two drugs is highly effective at keeping some women with breast cancer free of the disease, say researchers. Almost 99 per cent of women given the Herceptin-Taxol combination remained cancer-free for at least three years after treatment, a study found. The trial looked at the effect of the two drugs in patients with a specific type of breast cancer that responds to Herceptin. Almost 99 per cent of women given a combination of the drugs Herceptin and Taxol combination remained cancer-free for at least three years after treatment . All had lower-grade tumours that had not spread to the lymph nodes. Around one in four women with breast cancer have tumours characterised by the HER2 protein. Here, there is too much of a protein called human epidermal . growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) on the surface of their cells. The extra HER2 receptors stimulate the . cancer cells to divide and grow. Herceptin locks on to the HER2 protein. This blocks the receptor and stops the cells from dividing and growing. However the drug is normally reserved for those at higher risk. The new study showed that giving . lower-risk women with HER2 breast cancer Herceptin plus the chemotherapy . drug Taxol was highly effective with few adverse side effects. The drug could help the one in four women with breast cancer tumours characterised by the HER2 protein . Of the 406 patients studied, fewer than 4 per cent experienced serious complications in the form of nerve damage and temporary heart failure. 'This is great news for patients and their physicians,' said professor Kathy Albain, from Loyola University Medical Centre in Maywood, Illinois, who presented the findings at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.

Citing a potential threat to public health, the Food and Drug Administration is taking steps toward phasing out the use of some antibiotics in animals processed for meat in the U.S. Many cattle, hog and poultry producers give their animals antibiotics regularly to ensure that they are healthy and to make the animals grow faster. Now, the agency has announced that it will ask pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily stop labeling drugs important for treating human infection as acceptable for that growth promotion in animals. This photo shows turkeys raised without the use of antibiotics at David Martin's farm, in Lebanon, Pennsylvania . If the companies sign on, and one major company has already said it will, using those antibiotics to promote growth in animals would be illegal. Prescriptions would be required to use the drugs for animal illnesses. The FDA has been debating how to address the issue of antibiotics in meat for several years as consumers have become more aware of the issue and are clamoring for antibiotic-free meat. McDonald's, among other companies, has moved to limit the drugs in their meat, pushing many animal producers to go along. The FDA move is designed to limit antibiotic-resistant diseases in humans. Repeated exposure to antibiotics can lead germs to become resistant to the drug so that it is no longer effective in treating a particular illness. Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health problem. In September the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released sobering estimates that more than 23,000 people a year are dying from drug-resistant infections. The biggest risk is from germs spread in hospitals, and it's not clear how much of the problem is related to the use of drugs in meat. Still, the FDA says this is one step toward decreasing resistance. 'We need to be selective about the drugs we use in animals and when we use them,' said William Flynn of FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine. Food and Drug Administration is taking steps toward phasing out the use of some antibiotics in animals processed for meat . 'Antimicrobial resistance may not be completely preventable, but we need to do what we can to slow it down.' The new guidance will give the companies three years to comply. Michael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner of foods, said he believes asking industry to make the changes is the fastest way to help phase the drugs out. If the FDA made the process mandatory, he said, the agency would have had to move forward with a complex regulatory process that could take years. 'We have high confidence based on dialogue with industry that this initiative will succeed,' Taylor said. Drug company Zoetis, a leading manufacturer of animal antibiotics, has already said they will comply. 'This reflects our continued commitment to antibiotic stewardship and represents the many ways that Zoetis promotes the responsible use of antimicrobial drugs in animals,' the company's statement said. Animal agriculture groups will not have much of a choice in the matter if drug companies sign on and make the drugs' use illegal. But many antibiotics will still be available for those producers to use, just not those that the FDA has classified as most important for treating human infections. Some of the antibiotics that could not be used in animals are penicillins and tetracyclines, the FDA said. Many animal groups signaled support for the FDA guidance after it was announced Wednesday, including the National Pork Producers Council. Still, Dr. Liz Wagstrom of the pork producers' group said the FDA action will mean 'real change' in the way antibiotics are used on the farm, as some animals may not grow as quickly and producers may see more disease. She said she does not know how much it will cost the industry. Some advocates pushing to rid the animal food supply of antibiotics said the FDA did not go far enough. Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York, a microbiologist, said the FDA should have made the action mandatory. The guidance 'falls woefully short of what is needed to address a public health crisis,' she said. Others hailed the agency move as progress. 'We commend FDA for taking the first steps since 1977 to broadly reduce antibiotic overuse in livestock,' said Laura Rogers of The Pew Charitable Trusts' human health and industrial farming campaign. 'There is more work to do, but this is a promising start, especially after decades of inaction.'","McDonald's has moved to limit the drugs in their meat .

A mother has shared her grief seven months after her pregnant daughter was mysteriously murdered in Hawaii and the baby's father vanished without a trace. Brittany Jane Royal, 25, was newly pregnant when she was strangled with rope, dragged across rocks and thrown into the ocean off Kalpana, Hawaii. Police initially suspected her missing boyfriend, Boza David Johnson, 22, but family members have insisted he had no money to escape or motive to kill her. Months later, a local news site received a cryptic note suggesting Johnson, known to his friends and family as 'Bo', had also been killed amid racial tensions. What happened? Brittany Royal, 25, was murdered in Hawaii in May and her boyfriend, Bo Johnson, 22, vanished and was suspected of killing her. But her family is not convinced he was responsible . Now the Royal and Johnson families have been left with little to go on and no further to finding out exactly what happened to their loved ones. 'Whoever killed her does not deserve to be walking around,' Royal's mother Julie told People magazine in a new interview. 'But I feel like I can't really grieve right now because of the not knowing. It's always there. It's always going to be there.' Julie was initially worried about how . trusting her 'free spirited' daughter could be but knew it was right . for Brittany when she decided to go traveling to the Big Island of . Hawaii in January. There, . she met Johnson and just months later they returned to the family home . in Tustin, California to break the news: they were expecting a baby. They also announced their plans for the . future; Brittany said she would work as a yoga instructor while Bo . wanted give lava tours. Missed: Brittany's mother Julie, pictured with her left and as a baby, said she cannot grieve until she knows what happened to her daughter, who was strangled, and who was responsible . Tragedy: Brittany was newly pregnant and looking forward to starting a yoga business when she was killed . 'She seemed finally ready to settle down,' Royal said. But less than three weeks later, Bo failed to turn up to a meeting with a real estate agent and Brittany didn't call her mother to wish her a happy birthday. Days later, on May 28, a fisherman found her body in waters off the island. Unanswered questions: Brittany's family became concerned when she failed to call her mother on her birthday, and her partner missed an appointment with a real estate agent . Police . believe that Bo killed his girlfriend, Hawaii Police Department Lt. Gregory M. Esteban told People magazine, but added that his whereabouts . since have not been known. But Bo's sister Sarah told the magazine: 'He's not capable of this. He has a good heart. We were taught right from wrong.' Then . to further complicate the case, a news site received the anonymous . letter claiming that Bo had also been killed following racial tensions. The note listed specifics about the alleged murder. Bizzare: Signs have started appearing around the town saying that Bo was murdered on the lava fields . The writer explains that Bo had intended to buy land at Kalapana and conduct lava tours without paying locals a cut of $1,000 a week. 'Haole had to be killed befor (sic) he buy land... said this message 2 haole, stay out of Puna - Puna is for the pono,' the note said. In Hawaii, 'haole' is a term used for caucasians and 'pono' is a Hawaiian word for righteousness. Posters also began to emerge around the town, reading: 'You killed the baby! They killed Bo on the lava flow! Confess!' Ahead of his disappearance, Bo was supposed to meet with a realtor and was going to sign a deal to purchase 10 acres of land - but he never showed up. Scene: Her body was found off the coast of Kalpana, Hawaii near to where the couple had been camping . Now his family doesn't know what to think. 'If he isn't the murderer, that means he's dead,' his sister said. 'So what do we have to look forward to. I keep praying that the police get their job done and they find this killer.' Both of the families have said that the police have failed to keep them updated with the case, and for now, all they can do is wonder what happened to their loved ones and who is responsible.","Brittany Royal was found strangled and dumped in the ocean off Big Island in Hawaii in May and her boyfriend, Bo Johnson, was reported missing .

A group of lawmakers has taken time out from Capitol Hill's budget showdown to propose an amendment to the Obamacare law that would exempt volunteer firefighters and paramedics from a loophole that threatens to close stations. The Affordable Care Act was enacted without an exemption for volunteer first-responders, potentially forcing fire departments to buy coverage for hundreds of thousands of volunteers even though they're not on any payroll. The result could have put most of America's 1 million fire departments in a position of diverting equipment and training funds to pay for insurance policies or federal government fines. Thousands of them could face closure because of the added costs. New . York Republican Rep. Chris Collins wrote to IRS Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel last week, calling the result 'a public safety disaster.' MailOnline highlighted the issue on Monday, bringing swift action from a Pennsylvania congressman and a bipartisan group of six U.S. senators. Scroll down for video . Help is on the way! Lawmakers have rushed to respond to national outcry by writing an Obamacare amendment just for volunteer first-responders . Not just firefighters: Many paramedics and other emergency medical personnel volunteer their services to their communities in addition to holding down full-time jobs . Rep. Lou Barletta (C), a Pennsylvania Republican, has forced Obamacare'€™s impact on volunteer firefighters onto Congress'€™ front-burner. His state leads the nation in the percentage of fire departments that are staffed by volunteers . Their 'Protect Volunteer Firefighters and Emergency Responders Act' would amend the Affordable Care Act to provide volunteer emergency service workers a carve-out ensuring that they're not counted toward employee totals that would trigger the law's employer mandate. Eighty-seven per cent of U.S. fire departments are entirely or 'mostly' staffed by volunteers, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''’m sure that this is an unintended consequence of the Affordable Care Act, but it is a very real threat to public safety.,' Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Lou Barletta told MailOnline. Barletta has spearheaded the effort, which attracted the attention of senators from both sides of the political aisle. 'If fire companies have to provide health insurance to their volunteers, it would be an unbearable cost and many would have to reduce the number of volunteers, or close their doors entirely,' he said. 'Either way, this is a serious public safety problem. Of course, the IRS could solve it tomorrow by saying that volunteer fire fighters are not employees.' The Obama administration has offered a . host of Obamacare exemptions to politically favored companies and labor . unions. But Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, insisted that . leaving volunteer firefighters on the sidelines was an 'unintentional . consequence' and 'a technical error.' Firefighters battled a blaze in the aftermath of a Nov. 18 tornado in Washington, Illinois. The vast majority of U.S. firefighters are community volunteers . Wildfires like this August 2013 disaster near Banning, California bring volunteer firefighters out of the woodwork to risk their lives . As written, Manchin conceded, the Affordable Care Act 'jeopardizes . funding for training and emergency response hours by imposing . unreasonable burdens on many of our volunteer emergency response . agencies.' Angus King, . an independent senator from Maine, said in a statement that the bill . 'will draw an important distinction between those volunteers and . full-time, paid staff that will ensure emergency response units can . continue to deliver robust services without the fear of having to deal . with cumbersome federal regulations.' Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republcian, called it 'unacceptable that an undue burden could be placed on volunteer fire departments across the country. Only Congress can prevent forest fires? Volunteers are often the first line of defense against wildfires in America's forests, and Obamacare threatened to put many of their fire departments in jeopardy of closing . 'It is imperative that this ambiguity in the law be clarified and fixed,' she said Wednesday. Alaska Democratic Sen. Mark Begich . added that 'first responders and firefighters who put their safety on . the line to keep our families and communities safe ... need the . certainty that they have the necessary resources to keep offering their . services.' It's unclear how . many fire departments would have been negatively affected by the . Affordable Care Act in its current form, since the employer coverage . mandate applies only to agencies that employe at least 50 people. Annual fines for fire departments that choose to flout the law would amount to $2,000 per employee, beginning after the first 30. This International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Volunteer Fire Council and the Congressional Fire Services Institute all offered endorsements of the legislation on Wednesday. 'This is a bipartisan issue which could have serious impacts on staffing at fire departments across the United States,' said International Association of Fire Chiefs president William Metcalf. 'The IAFC looks forward to working with Congress and the Administration to help ensure fire departments of all types are able to continue saving lives and serving their communities.' Virginia Democrat Mark Warner and Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey are also co-sponsors of the Senate legislation. 'I would rather tear down the whole thing and start over again with a fresh health care approach, but the president has made it clear that he won't allow that to happen. So, we're left to try to pave over the potholes, and this is a big one – possibly affecting fire stations nationwide.'

This remarkable video shows the dramatic transformation in a mother with cerebral palsy after she smokes cannabis to relieve her symptoms. Jacqueline Patterson, from Kansas City, Missouri, has a severe stutter and suffers incredible pain because of her condition. She has found that marijuana is the only thing that really helps - but each time she buys or smokes it, she runs the risk of losing custody of her four children. Despite marijuana being legal for medical reasons in 20 states, it is not legal in Kansas City where Ms Patterson lives. But because of her debilitating symptoms, she says using the drug actually makes her better mother. Before she smokes cannabis, she seriously struggles to speak. Afterwards, she speaks calmly and with no problems at all. In the video, she explains: 'I was born with cerebral palsy and a severe stutter - which has got to be one of the most stigmatising disabilities invented by God. It's very humiliating. 'My right side of my body is much noticeably weaker than my left and my right arm is always painfully tense. 'I went through my entire childhood in pain because I couldn't move my muscles.' She realised from the first time she smoked cannabis that it eased her symptoms.

In the film, viewers meet Ms Patterson when she hasn't smoked marijuana for three days. Her stutter means it can take several seconds for her to pronounce a word. Driving into downtown Kansas City to look for the drug, she explains: 'I smoke to be the mother my children deserve - they are really cool kids.

Disheveled: Andrew Nisbet, 31, has been arrested for sexually abusing at least two boys while working as a golf instructor in Livermore, California . A well known youth golf coach in San Francisco has been arrested on his own course and charged with 65 counts of pedophila after allegedly assaulting two male students - one as young as 12 - over a three-year period. Andrew Nisbet, 31, who is married, tutored students at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore and was arrested on Saturday - the day before he was due to receive a PGA award for coach of the year at the prestigious Contra Costa Country Club. Police have said they expect many more victims to come forward during their investigation and he is currently being held in Santa Rita Jail without bail - while officers collect evidence from his home, which is next-door to an elementary school. The 49-page complaint filed on Tuesday by the Alameda County District Attorney's Office said Nisbet, who also operates the GRIP Junior Golf Academy which has 175 students, is accused of performing oral sex on his victims in his car from December 2009 through March 2012 and showing them pornography on his phone. The complaint also alleges that other sex acts were committed by Nisbet in the golf clubs parking lot and during out-of-town golfing excursions. Livermore Police officer Steve Goard said that authorities became aware of the allegations when one of Nisbet's golf students reported that he was abused in November. Scroll Down for Video . Worrying: Nisbet was arrested at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore - the day before he was due to receive the prestigious PGA's 2013 Junior Golf Leader Award . Las Positas Golf Course have announced he has been fired since his arrest. 'He befriended them as the cool coach, gave them rides to and from practice and bought them gifts, including top-of-the-line golf equipment,' Goard said to the San Jose Mercury News. 'He created a coach-athlete bond and, as he did, was figuring out who he could get away with it with.' Nisbet was taken into custody at 10 am on the golf course while he was working and during his initial interview police said that he admitted some lewd acts with the children. His wife of two years, Kimberly Patrick Nisbet, has not commented on the allegations and appears to have moved out of the family home in Livermore, which is next door to Jackson Elementary School. Abuse across four states: Police are investigating the possibility that Nisbet may have abuse hundreds of children across 4 states because of his extensive work with youth golf over the past eight years . Well connected: Nisbet is seen here accepting an PGA junior league award last year from US Ryder Cup Captain Davis Love III as his students pass their time in an airport playing cards as seen on his Facebook page . Wedding day: Andrew Nisbet has been married to his wife Kimberly for two years and they recently traveled to Lake Tahoe to celebrate their anniversary . On Tuesday, Livermore police said that they were continuing their investigation and said it was probable that more charges will be brought against Nisbet - who has been teaching at Las Positas since 2006. 'We're in the process of interviewing two other local victims, and we've been led to believe there are possible victims in Michigan and other states,' Goard said to the San Jose Mercury News. 'He traveled all over -- to North Carolina and Southern California for a lot of PGA-sponsored events.' Nisbet appeared in ourt on Tuesday in front of one of the alleged victim's parents who they said he been coaching their son for eight years. Arrested: Andrews Nisbet with his wife Kimberly - Nisbet has been arrested and charged with 65 counts of pedophilia by the Alameda County District Attorney's Office for abuse spanning three years . Nisbet's own parents were in court as well on Tuesday to watch their son being charged with 65 counts of pedophilia. According to his biography online, Nisbet majored in professional golf management at Mississippi State University and had worked as a golf pro at The Country Club of Birmingham in Alabama and Beech Woods Golf Course in Southfield, Michigan. It also claims he is 'one of the only Top 50 US Kids Golf Master Teachers in Northern California.' Neighbor Jeremy West said he saw detectives at Nesbit's Jackson Avenue home on Saturday. 'There's going to be some people freaking out in the neighborhood,' West said to NBC News. 'I don't want to see him again. He doesn't need to be around here.' Scene of the arrest: Nisbet was collared by police on the golf course while teaching on Saturday at 10 am . Livermore police said that as a nationally acclaimed golf coach, Nisbet would have had access to hundreds of kids and used his position to sexually assault at least three of them - and that number is likely to grow. 'We have been giving information that he potentially victimized children in Michigan, Alabama, Mississippi and North Carolina,' Goard said. 'And some of the kids were victimized at these golf events.' Calls to Nisbet's attorney seeking comment were not returned.","Andrew Nisbet, 31, was arrested on the Las Positas Golf Course on Saturday and charged with 65 counts of sexual abuse on two boys - one as young as 12 .

Now her lawyers have launched a constitutional challenge to the ban on Muslim veils, arguing that the controversial law of 2011 which made them illegal should be scrapped. Belin’s husband, Michael Khiri, was arrested for insulting one of the officers who stopped his wife in Trappes during the Muslim fasting period of Ramadan. This led to a large crowd gathering on the couple’s housing estate, where hundreds of mainly Muslim immigrants live. Soon bus stops and other public property was being destroyed, as running battles took place between youths and the police. Belin, a Muslim convert who has worn a veil all her adult life, was outraged when her husband received a three-month suspended prison sentence. In October, Belin herself went on trial for defying the ban on Islamic veils and for insulting a police officer. Many conservative politicians claim that France's 6million-plus Muslims are changing the nature of the country. Above, a protest against the burka ban in Paris in 2010 . Now her lawyer has launched a constitutional challenge to the entire burka ban at the criminal court in Versailles, west of Paris. Philippe Bataille told the court that the ban was discriminatory, unconstitutional, and against the guiding principles of the French Republic. Mr Bataille said his client was deliberating shunning the hearing because ‘she does not want to be wrongly perceived as the symbol of a supposed rampant Islamisation'.

They say that burkas are a symbol of many Muslims' desire to exclude themselves from other French people. This has led to growing support for the far-right National Front party which wants to stop the so-called ‘Islamisation’ of society. Thibault de Montbrial, for the police, said that ‘a small group of radical elements were testing the institutions’ of secular France, under the guise of religious freedom. Earlier this month, European judges heard the case of a 23-year-old French woman who also claimed the burka ban violates her rights.

Survivor: Karen Perrin spent night hours trying to free herself after getting locked inside a restroom at work . For Karen Perrin, what started as an innocent trip to the ladies’ room at work Friday night ended eight terrifying hours later with her clawing her way to freedom. Mrs Perrin, the wife of former Washington Redskins running back Lonnie Perrin, works as a senior assistant at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Washington, DC. On Friday, she stayed at the office until 10pm making travel arrangements for her boss, who was preparing to go abroad. She called her husband to let him known that she was going to head home in 10-15 minutes. With the details of the trip finalized, Perrin packed her bags but decided to use the restroom before going home. She left her cell phone at her desk. After emerging from the stall, the woman washed her hands and made for the door, but it turned out to be locked. ‘It sounds crazy, but I went back into the stall and then washed my hands again hoping to change something,' Mrs Perrin told ABC News. Growing nervous, the trapped woman jiggled the latch, kicked it with her foot, but it would not budge. 'That's when it hit me,' she recalled. 'I'm locked in here.' Karen Perrin spent the next eight hours desperately trying to escape. Escape route: After realizing she was trapped, Perrin tried shoving paper towels under the door to draw someone's attention . Fighting tooth and nail: The woman eventually got her hands on a metal rod and began hacking at the drywall until she finally made a hole big enough for her hand to go through it . 'I felt hopelessness. I felt like I was going to die in there because of the anxiety I was feeling,' she told the station. Unable to call for help, Perrin started pulling paper towels and shoving them under the door in the hope of drawing the attention of a security guard monitoring surveillance cameras. ‘I probably put 200 towels out,’ Perrin recalled. ‘But after nobody came to rescue me I realized I had to do something else.’ Looking for an alternate escape route, Perrin climbed on a chair and reached a hatch in the ceiling. Although she was unable to pull herself up, she discovered a 3-foot-long pole in the rafters. Famous spouse: Karen is married to former Washington Redskins running back Lonnie Perrin (right) In a scene straight out of the classic 1994 prison-break film Shawshank Redemption, the office worker clawed her way through the wall using the metal tool until she was able to make a hole big enough for her hand to reach through it and open the door from the other side. After two hours of hacking at the wall with the metal rod through layers of drywall and insulation, Perrin finally created an opening next to the doorknob, stuck her arm through it, bloodying it in the process, grabbed the handle on the other side and sprung herself free, MyFox DC reported. ‘I was crying. I felt like I was escaping a bad dream, like when you have a nightmare and you wake up and your heart is pounding and you realize, ""Oh, I was just dreaming. Did that just happen. Am I OK?”’ she said. Worried sick: Lonnie Perrin, pictured left in 1977 when he was playing for the Broncos, feared that something terrible had happened to his wife (right) when she failed to come home . Karen immediately called her husband and daughter, who feared that something terrible had happened to her after she failed to come home, and were on the verge of going out to search for her. Mrs Perrin suffered contusions to her hands, but said she does not plan to pursue legal action. However, she hopes that the management of the building would put safety measures in place to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Roaring criticism: Dietmar Hamann, here celebrating scoring Man City's second against Bolton in 2007, has slammed Pellegrini for his Munich gaffe . Didi Hamann fears Manchester City’s ‘ridiculous and scandalous’ Champions League blunder in Munich will cost his old club millions of pounds. City beat European champions Bayern Munich 3-2 at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday but did not send on leading scorer Sergio Aguero to chase the one further goal they needed to top Group D because manager Manuel Pellegrini thought his team had to score another two. It meant that, rather than finishing ahead of Bayern on the head-to-head ruling following their 3-1 defeat by the Germans at the  Etihad in October, City ended up second. They are now almost certain to be paired with one of the heavyweights of European football in Monday’s draw for the first knockout round. ‘It’s a cock-up,’ said Hamann on Wednesday. ‘It shouldn’t have happened. The whole City coaching staff haven’t covered themselves in glory here. It’s a poor effort. ‘They say the manager is only as good as his backroom staff. He must have had six, seven, eight people around him. For none of them to know and make him aware of the magnitude another goal would have is ridiculous and scandalous in a way. VIDEO: Watch confused City boss fail to realise he needed only one more goal . SKY SPORTS: You're 3-2 up, you've got quite a bit of time to get this goal which would have topped the group, were you not tempted to put on (Sergio) Aguero, your best striker? PELLEGRINI: I was tempted if we scored the fourth goal of course, that's why I sent out Aguero to warm up but also I think that it was a risk to continue with (David) Silva, he can't play more than 70 minutes. ‘Even a player doesn’t go to the manager and say, “Bring Aguero on”.’ Interviewed by the radio station talkSPORT radio, Hamann added: ‘It looks like in the last 16 they are going to face Atletico Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona or Real Madrid. ‘City have a belief they have a chance of winning it but, if they’d won the group they would have faced Basle, Schalke, Leverkusen, Zenit St Petersburg or Porto. They’d have had a bye. ‘Bayern made £60-£70million by winning the Champions League. Going out at the last 16 could cost millions of pounds.’ Pellegrini’s lack of awareness was even more embarrassing because the club’s Twitter feed pointed out they only needed one more goal to go through as group winners. Confusion: Pellegrini said he was tempted to bring Aguero on if City scored the fourth, but they only needed one . Mishap: Pellegrini brought off Edin Dzeko in the closing stages and brought on Jack Rodwell . Man City could have gone through with another goal, based on their head-to-head record against Bayern . Second place: Pellegrini said it 'was difficult to score two goals' with the score at 3-2, but City only one . Turnaround: James Milner wheels away after putting City 3-2 ahead in Munich having been 2-0 down . The tweet read: ‘If City were to score another and win 4-2, we’d win the group! City fans roaring their team on . . . ’ However, James Milner, scorer of City’s third goal, believes they have proved they can beat any team.

Mary Barra, who holds an MBA from Stanford University, is a GM 'lifer' who followed in her father's footsteps and joined the car company aged 18. The 51-year-old will start her new job on January 15, taking over from CEO Dan Akerson as the first woman to fill the role. The appointment is something of a personal landmark for Mary Barra whose father Ray Makela was a GM die maker for 39 years at the Pontiac plant. Scroll down for video .

In her 33 years at GM Motors, she has risen through the ranks to become the current global product chief. She . is known for her hands-on approach and is often found at the company's . test track, whizzing around in the latest models. She also sent GM engineers . for work experience at local car dealerships so they could see first-hand . what customers wanted from their vehicles. Seeing her talent, GM sent Barra to Stanford University where she gained an MBA. She prefers a team approach to problems and is a relentless hard worker - often at her desk by 6am. She is highly competitive about becoming the best in the industry. The newly-appointed CEO met her husband Tony, a management consultant, while studying at GM's technical school. Mary Barra with her husband Tony earlier this year whom she met while she was at engineering school in Flint, Michigan . General Motors' Pontiac Michigan production line when Ms Barra's father Ray Makela worked for the company as a die maker . In her time at the car industry giant, Barra has seen it buckle under the pressure of a crippled U.S. economy . and declare itself bankrupt, requiring a government bailout. However thanks to the guiding hand of Akerson, and Barra's transformative measures in product development, GM Motors has made nearly $20billion. On Monday, the company officially shed the derisive moniker of 'Government Motors' when the government sold the last of the GM shares it inherited as part of a bailout in 2008 and 2009. The move by GM to put a woman in the driving . seat means that the 51-year-old mother-of-two has shattered a glass . ceiling in a typically male-dominated industry. She . still faces challenges of paring down GM's costs and winning over buyers . in international markets such as India and South America. Ms Barra studied engineering at Kettering University in Michigan before joining GM Motors 33 years ago . Akerson, 65, said he had planned to stay at least until spring, but his wife's advanced cancer diagnosis changed that. He . said the board unanimously picked Barra from several internal . candidates because of the breadth of her experience, her management . record, her people skills and her understanding of GM's operations. There was a personal note to his appointment of Barra for Akerson, as he told the New York Times: 'It was almost like watching your daughter graduate from college.' Akerson . hinted at Barra's promotion earlier this year when he told a women's . business group in Detroit that a ‘car gal’ would someday run one of the . Detroit Three automakers but he made it clear on Tuesday that she wasn't . picked because she's a woman. ‘Mary's one of the most gifted executives I've met in my career,’ he said. Following her appointment on Tuesday, Ms Barra tweeted: 'Thanks everyone for your well wishes.' She added: 'Thanks to Dan Akerson for his amazing leadership. The new @GM team is aligned and ready to continue the momentum and pick up the pace.' Mary Barra (pictured left in December 2013) will take over from Dan Akerson (pictured right) as General Motors' next CEO in January 2014 . Since . February 2011, Barra has held what many say is the most important job . at GM.

Along . the way, she earned a reputation as a manager who made tough decisions, . yet was able to get people to follow her lead and work as a team, . according to current and former GM executives. The . 51-year-old executive has been in charge of design, engineering and . quality for all GM vehicles and has shepherded most of the company's . recent new vehicle introductions.

David Trotter, 72, of Wayne County's Canton Township, said he found the wreck with his crew of explorers in July, the Detroit Free Pressfirst reported. The zebra mussel-covered wreck was discovered in nearly 175 feet of water, 25-30 miles northeast of Harrisville. Scroll down for video... Found: Shipwreck hunter David Trotter and his team of divers headed out to Lake Huron in July & discovered a Civil War era ship the Keystone State that sank in 1861. One of many ships he has discovered since the 1970's . Lost in the lake: The wreckage of a wooden steamship that sank 152 years ago in a storm on Lake Huron with no survivors has been found, a Michigan explorer said . The Keystone State was heading from Detroit to Milwaukee when it sank during a powerful November storm, claiming 33 lives. According to some historians, the ship might have sunk with its crew while secretly hauling Civil War supplies, the newspaper reported. 'She literally sailed into oblivion. Nobody heard anything from her,' Trotter told Reuters in a telephone interview. 'It's a great chance to touch history to swim back into time.' The ship, which typically transported immigrants to the west and cargo east, left in hurry on its last voyage with no lifeboats aboard, he added. 'That adds to the mystery of her leaving,' Trotter said. X-marks the spot: The wreck was found in 175 feet of water 30 miles northeast of Harrisville, a small city north of Lansing. The location put the wreck about 50 miles off course . Steaming along: Although the one in this picture is not the actual steamer, the Keystone State was among a class known as palace steamers . The nearly 300-foot-long ship was built in Buffalo, New York It had paddle wheels on its sides nearly 40 feet in diameter. The ship was among a class known as palace steamers, according to maritime historian, author and artist Robert McGreevy. 'The interiors were made to look like the finest hotels. They were quite beautiful inside,' he said. 'They had leaded glass windows and carved arches and mahogany trim.' Maritime historian C. Patrick Labadie said the wreck's discovery can shed light on ship construction methods of the era and how people once traveled. Sank without trace: The wooden steamer Keystone State that sank in 1861 in Lake Huron. No one knew it's whereabouts until Trotter and a crew of deep water divers found the ship using side scan sonar in June of 2013 . The deep: With one of the two massive 40 foot tall side-wheels off to his right, diver Marty Lutz of Warren, Mich., explores in the deep waters of Lake Huron the wreckage of the Keystone State . 'This one stands out,' Labadie said. 'It's a unique wreck.' Using a side-scan sonar device, Trotter and his team found the shipwreck the weekend after July 4. Crew members made 30 dives on the site from July through September. Divers shot video for DVDs that Trotter will sell online and use in presentations. 'The stern is kind of broken up and crumbled. The boilers are in good condition, the engine is in good condition,' said diver Marty Lutz, 56, of Warren. 'The wheels are both standing. ... It was pretty amazing to see those sitting upright on the bottom like that.' McGreevy told the Detroit Free Press that the only way to know what the Keystone State was carrying would be to conduct a search of the area believed to be its final route. 'I think it’s going to remain one of the mysteries of the Great Lakes,' he said.","The Civil War-era ship's final resting place was a mystery for 150 years .

They included maggots on the floor of consulting rooms, patients given out-of-date medicines or injections, and nurses not trained in basic first aid. Put at risk: The NHS watchdog uncovered a catalogue of failings at more than 300 practices (file picture) At one surgery, inspectors arrived to find the only GP had been suspended by the General Medical Council and none of the locum doctors covering had shown up. At another, the only two GPs had each referred the other to the GMC for alleged incompetence. Patients at a third brought their own chairs because they had to sit outside for hours to get an appointment, the Care Quality Commission found. A number of practices were putting patients in danger by using jabs for meningitis, cervical cancer and measles which were out of date and therefore probably ineffective. In ten cases, the failings were so severe they could ‘potentially affect thousands of people’. Several of the failing practices have been taken over or closed. Professor Steve Field, the CQC’s chief inspector of GPs, said: ‘We found some surgeries where there were out of date vaccines in the fridge. If you think you’re immune and you’re not, you could then pick up the illness. ‘If a woman got pregnant and thought she was rubella immune and they picked up German measles... they could have a rubella baby – who are deaf-blind.’ Since April, inspectors from the CQC have visited 1,000 practices across England where concerns had already been raised about care.

Patients at the Woodlands Practice in Chislehurst, Kent, where the only GP had been suspended, have been transferred to another surgery. Over the next two years the CQC will inspect all 8,000 GP surgeries in England. From April, it will start investigating out-of-hours services.

Some 47,000 British women and 400,000 . in 64 other countries were affected – although Mas denied the implants . posed a serious health risk and referred to any claimants as ‘money . grabbers’. Mas was also . fined £62,000, while four other PIP executives were given lesser . sentences at yesterday’s hearing in Marseille – the biggest and most . expensive trial in French history. There were cheers in court as the . verdict was read out, while hundreds of others joined a protest against . Mas outside. Fears spread across the globe in 2011 after French health authorities advised 30,000 women to have PIP implants removed.

PIP implants, like the one pictured right, were sold to some 300,000 women around the world until a global panic erupted in 2011 when authorities in France recommended patients with them should have them removed due to an abnormally high rupture rate . British victim Jan Spivey, said before . the verdict: ‘We want to see some accountability at long last. We have . high hopes that France will bring justice for British victims.’ She . said the evidence that emerged should ‘shame and embarrass’ the British . Government. Health ministers failed to support British victims to the . same degree that their French counterparts were backed by their own . authorities, she claimed.

One solicitor, Kevin Timms, said the . private cosmetic surgery industry also needed better regulation to . prevent problems in the future. Rajiv . Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic . Surgeons, said: ‘There can be no way of compensating the victims of PIP . for the scale of this betrayal, and in that respect no sentencing can . ever be adequate punishment. ‘Whilst . there is no way for regulation to prevent criminal behaviour, . undoubtedly the system failed  hundreds of thousands of women . worldwide.’ During the trial: Mas, centre, who was the founder and long-time chief executive of the now-defunct Poly .

Many UK women are continuing to fight . for compensation after having the implants fitted - many of whom who . have had to pay for removals or replacements out of their own pockets. Richard . Langton, a lawyer from Slater & Gordon, which is representing more . than 200 British women, said: 'We have hundreds of clients treated by . many UK clinics who fitted the now banned implants, but unfortunately . many of the clinics do not have insurance and are unable to meet any . judgement. 'There will be a trial in October next year against solvent clinics who continue to deny liability. 'Slater . & Gordon have devised a negotiated settlement agreement with all . the banks to pay compensation to women who used a credit card to pay for . the surgery.

Some of the hundreds of women who registered as plaintiffs are seen arriving at the trial on arrival at the temporary courthouse. More than 5,000 women who received PIP implants joined the trial as civil parties . 'This will . be small consolation for women who didn’t use a credit card. We are . also actively pursuing a claim against TUV, the German company who were . supposed to be monitoring PIP in France and who failed to spot the fraud . that was being perpetrated. 'Now . that the criminal trial in France is over, we can hopefully pursue a . claim in England if at all possible on behalf of women who would . otherwise go uncompensated.'

Denton – who calls himself a ‘non-medical doctor’ – used his personal Twitter account to claim ‘Cancer, diabetes, HIV, etc etc, all curable without the big pharmaceuticals’,  it is alleged. His website, livebloodtest.com, advertises a form of blood test involving ‘a very powerful microscope’, used to detect ‘imbalances’. The court heard one article claimed: ‘I have advised women for years not to wear bras. ‘When they return for a blood test, the results show a reduction of acidity in the breast area.’ Further passages on the website read: ‘Wake up to the fact that cancer is a disease caused by lifestyle and as such is curable by lifestyle changes and herbs. ‘Natural cancer cures are being suppressed in order to cull population growth.’ Denton, who represented himself, at first refused to confirm his name to District Judge Andrew Sweet. ‘I’m not “Mr” Errol Denton. I’m Errol of the Denton family, not ‘Mr’, the corporate fiction,’ he said. ‘I am a living soul, I have inalienable rights. I am here by special invitation.’ Prosecutor Alexandra Ward opened the case for Westminster City Council, ignoring frequent cries of ‘objection’ from Denton. She said Denton was the manager of a company called Live Blood Test which rented a room at No 1 Harley Street. ‘Mr Denton operates from there regularly,’ she said. ‘He regularly uses the internet to post advertisements of his website and through Twitter, as well as blogging sites to advertise his microscopy service in relation to this blood test. 'Wake up to the fact that cancer is a disease caused by lifestyle and as such is curable by lifestyle changes and herbs': Denton's claims have lead him to be prosecuted under the Cancer Act 1939 . ‘In part, it is suggested it could assist with the treatment of cancer,’ Miss Ward said. Denton, however, claimed he did not write the articles, adding: ‘They were done by a corporate entity not based in the UK.’ He claims that various websites bearing his name are run by a Dubai-based company. ‘My representation has been damaged by internet agitators. They are the ones who made the complaint. They are sponsored by the pharmaceutical companies,’ he claimed. Denton, of, Woodford Green, east London, denies nine breaches of  the Cancer Act. The trial will resume in March. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Errol Denton is said to have used Twitter to boast diseases were curable .

Doctor Terence Burley had a six-year affair with a patient he allgedly seduced in his surgery . A family doctor seduced a grieving patient at his surgery before embarking on a six-year affair that ended in a cat fight between his wife and his mistress, a tribunal heard. Dr Terence Burley, 64, continued to treat Christine Turner and her family after the romance began in 2003 and even cared for her dying estranged husband Richard during his battle with stomach cancer. The cheating doctor left wife Jane and four children to be with his lover, but when their relationship broke down in early 2009, Mrs Turner, 62, was arrested following a public spat with the medic’s wife. Dr Burley, who gave evidence at The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester today, where he is accused of misconduct and faces being struck off if found guilty. The medic fell for his patient of 20 years after she sought consolation from him over her mother’s death at the Minster Medical Practice, in Peterborough. Mrs Turner claimed her doctor seduced her at his surgery then ‘pestered’ her into continuing the relationship, calling her up to 15 times a day. ‘There was a particular morning where a travel blanket was laid on the floor,’ she told the hearing earlier this year. ‘He asked me to sit on the floor on this rug. We were the only ones there. ‘Obviously I did because I felt very vulnerable being on my own and I didn’t think he was going to request any further. ‘He asked me to take my top off and he asked if I would like my breasts caressing. He asked me if I would like oral sex. ‘I didn’t say yes but I didn’t refuse because I was actually frightened because I knew his conduct as a GP and I didn’t know what his personal life was like and how he would react. ‘I didn’t know what would happen to me if I refused.’ Mrs Turner told the panel these meetings continued at the doctor’s surgery where he would ask her to touch and caress his private parts. ‘And with no emotional and no feeling that happened because I just wanted to get in and out of the surgery,’ she said. Wife and mistress: Christine Turner, left, ended up in a six-year affair with her GP Dr Terence Burley . Later the couple would meet at Christine’s late parents’ house for sex sessions. At . an earlier hearing, the MPTS panel found Burley had engaged in a . ‘consensual sexual relationship’ during three periods between 2003 and . 2008, but ruled Mrs Turner, known as ‘Patient A’ in the hearing, was . ‘emotionally vulnerable’ when the affair started shortly after her . mother’s death. Her . husband, Richard, was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer in 2005 and . was living with her and her teenage son, Alex, in her late parents’ home and Burley cared for him in the final phase of his life. Charges: Dr Burley was found guilty of misconduct at a tribunal today following his on/off affair with a patient . Despite . the GP’s denials, the panel found that a sexual relationship did . continue between 2005 and 2007 as Christine had claimed. Burley . then told his lover he had left his wife and asked if she still wanted . him at a dinner party with friends in December 2007. The . couple moved in together and lived ‘to all intents and purposes as man . and wife’. But the relationship broke down in early 2009 when Burley . returned to his wife. ‘On the day that I left, Patient A absolutely tore me to pieces because I had switched off the financial input,’ he said. The . affair came to a definitive end in January 2009 when a ‘violent’ cat-fight erupted between Mrs Turner and the doctor’s wife at the . Burleys’ home in Peterborough. Patient . A was arrested the following day and interviewed by police. She was . bailed before later being told no charges would be brought. She then . made her complaint to the General Medical Council. Previously, . Dr Burley had suffered fractured ribs and a broken nose after he and . Patient A's school-age son became embroiled in a brawl in 2008. He was then caught accessing the teenager's medical records when he was no longer his GP. He . later said it was ‘a moment of madness’ sparked out of fear because he . had previously been assaulted by Alex, receiving a broken nose and two . broken ribs, the tribunal heard. Dr . Burley faced allegations of pursuing and engaging in an emotional and . sexual relationship with a patient over three periods between 2003 and . 2008. He admitted . conducting an on-off affair but denied pursuing the woman and was . cleared of the charge. He said the relationship developed ‘by mutual . agreement’. Mrs Burley forgave her errant husband and they renewed their wedding vows after 38 years of marriage in May 2009. History: Dr Burley had been the woman's family's GP for 25 years at the Minster Medical Practice in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire . Dr . Burley told the panel it was ‘love at first sight’ when he met Jane at . University, and they married three years later in 1971. On . the day they renewed their wedding vows, Jane wrote on her blog: . ‘Today, TKB and I are renewing our vows after 38 years of marriage. ‘And . they said it would never last... that we were too young. I was an . aspiring drama student at Guildhall, and he was a medical student at . Bart’s. But we knew that we were soul mates.’ Speaking . of their reconciliation on her blog, Jane Burley, who spent time as a . mature student in Oxford, said: ‘The ceremony to renew our wedding vows . was very moving. ‘I . remembered the reasons why I had agreed to do this which were profoundly . deep-seated. Over the past thirty years, I had raised my brood and . rediscovered my academic confidence by going to Oxford as a mature . student in my fifties. ‘I . remembered the anxious questions from friends upon hearing that I . intended to take up my place at Oxford: “Is your husband going with you? How will he cope, I mean, who will prepare his meals?” ‘Well, . as I discovered, ladies, beware, if you are reckless enough to go off . to study in the dreaming spires, someone else will offer to “steam his . pudding” for him, whether he likes it or not! ‘So much for the “sisterhood”, yet another myth.’ GP: The Minster Medical Practice in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, where Dr Burley was a partner . Dr Burley wept as he told of the damage of his actions and promised the panel he would not be unfaithful to his wife again. When asked why, he had fallen for Mrs Turner he said: ‘Because she was the exact opposite [of my wife]. ‘I . think at the time, despite the fact she had been through bereavement . processes on two occasions, she had a love of life, a vivacity, a very . much can-do approach to things.’ ‘It’s had an absolutely devastating effect on my family. I can understand where they are coming from as well,’ he said. ‘I . think my overall view of if the same situation came again I would get . in my car and drive as far north or as far south as I could and keep . driving.’ The panel also . found a number of significant errors in Burley’s clinical practice . relating to his treatment of eight patients between 1999 and 2009, which . he said he has since addressed. The medic was cleared of several charges relating to him pursuing the relationship and Christine’s vulnerability. He was also cleared of making numerous misleading and dishonest statements in documentation in relation to the two patients. Dr Burley, of Harewood Gardens, Peterborough, was a partner at the Minster Medical Practice from 1980 to 2009. He has since worked as a salaried GP at the Botolph Bridge surgery, in Peterborough.","Dr Terence Burley fell for  patient of 20 years Christine Turner .

One in seven women who is currently 65 will live beyond her 100th birthday, official figures have revealed. The report, published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), also claimed that girls who are born in 2057 could potentially live to an average age of 116. Out of the 374,000 men and 393,000 women aged 65 this year, around 8 per cent of men and 14 per cent of women are expected to reach 100. But the ONS has predicted that 30 per cent of boys and 39 per cent of girls born in 2013 will live to 100. And incredibly, they said a generation of girls born in 2057 could have an average life expectancy of 116 if all the most optimistic health forecasts prove to be correct – although they admitted the prediction should be treated ‘with caution’. The ONS report said there are currently 14,000 people in the UK who are 100 or over, compared to just 600 in 1961. Charity Age UK called the figure, which has been steadily rising, ‘almost beyond belief’. The ONS figures also revealed that in 2012/13, the most recent tax year, the State pension and other payouts including pension credit cost the Government £94billion. However by 2062/63, they predicted that the bill could rocket to £438billion, a cost which the Government plans to cope with by increasing the State pension age. Rising life expectancy rates have already had a significant impact on the age the Government will be able to let people stop working and start claiming their pension. At the moment, a woman can claim her State pension from the age of 61 and nine months while a man’s State pension is paid from 65. However the Chancellor has announced that both sexes will reach a pension age of 68 in the ‘mid-2030s’ – which will rise again to 69 by the ‘late 2040s’. Malcolm McLean, from pension advisers Barnett Waddingham, said: ‘The ONS’s report is a stark reminder of the social and economic challenges the UK faces in dealing with the problems of an ageing society in the years ahead. ‘In terms of pension policy, we appear to have woken up rather late in the day to the need to try to address the ever-growing savings gap, and with it the likelihood of an impoverished old age for potentially millions of people in later life.’ Pensions minister Steve Webb said: ‘The age we get our State pension has to reflect rises in longevity to make sure our system remains fair and affordable for future generations.’","Report published by the Office for National Statistics .

A PE teacher has been barred from teaching after he was found to have bullied and intimidated his pupils. Paul Green, 39, swore at children and ordered them to do press ups or stand in the rain if he felt they stepped out of line. He also made one pupil kiss another, threw items across classrooms when he was angry and nicknamed an overweight pupil ‘JCB’. Paul Green, 39, swore at children and ordered them to do press ups or stand in the rain if he felt they stepped out of line. A teaching panel found that he was guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' while at St Thomas More College, Stoke-on-Trent between 2004 and 2012 . A teaching panel found that he was guilty of ‘unacceptable professional conduct’ while at St Thomas More College, Stoke-on-Trent between 2004 and 2012. He has been banned from teaching for three years. Professor Janet Draper said: ‘There were concerns from an early stage, namely in or about February 2006, with regard to the way in which Mr Green addressed pupils by using inappropriate and potentially offensive language.’ Following an incident in November 2011 relating to inappropriate language and behaviour on the part of Green towards pupils, he was suspended. A further investigation was undertaken which led to statements being taken from a variety of pupils, who complained of 'inappropriate, offensive and undermining behaviour' both in terms of language and physical confrontation. Green resigned from the School in early 2012. The panel found that Green used improper and inappropriate language and behaviour towards a number of pupils, including mocking and name-calling. Green admitted using language towards pupils including: 'ugly', 'big ears', 'p****', and 'poof'. He addressed one pupil with regard to his weight and made reference to a 'JCB', and restrained the boy against a wall when he went to leave. On the basis of another pupil's evidence, the panel found that Green would use language such as: 'f***off'', ""you're p***ing me off"" and 'for f***s sake' while in the classroom. Professor Draper said: 'Whilst such language was not directed at pupils, it was said in such a way that the whole class could clearly hear what he was saying. Such language is considered to be improper and offensive.' Green called certain pupils undergoing a bleep test 'pathetic' and 'bone idle', called a pupil a 'lying tart' and, during a rounders match, told a boy he would send him to the Deputy Head's corridor 'with a rounder's bat up his a***.' The panel found that, on one occasion, Green told Pupil C to kiss Pupil I and, when he refused, applied increased pressure until Pupil C leaned over to kiss Pupil I. Pupil I refused, 'adding to the humiliation felt by Pupil C and Pupil I's reaction is described as one of shock'. Professor Draper added: 'Mr Green would, when frustrated or angry, throw items across the class such as scrunched up paper, pens and pencils and, on one occasion, the register. This happened on one or two occasions each week.' He also 'embarrassed and humiliated' a pupil by putting up a picture of Tina Turner on the white board in the class room and then likening the pupil to her and certain of her characteristics such as her hair, however the panel found that this was not intended to be racially insensitive. Professor Draper added: 'The Panel heard from three pupils who gave oral evidence, and find, that they were all concerned at the behaviour of Mr Green. Pupil B described Mr Green as 'intimidating'. Pupil C stated that when Mr Green called him names, it made him feel 'small and unhappy'. Pupil D described Mr Green as 'scary' when in a bad mood which he said would occur two or three times a week. A further investigation was undertaken which led to statements being taken from a variety of pupils, who complained of 'inappropriate, offensive and undermining behaviour' both in terms of language and physical confrontation . 'Mr Green was described as unpredictable and that, when he was in a bad mood, the pupils would not know what he would do next.' The panel said that an incident took place when Green started to throw tennis balls at another PE Teacher and her class, and one of the tennis balls hit a pupil on the back of the head. Another pupil, Pupil K, then threw the ball back towards Mr Green who then started wrestling Pupil K and swinging him about. On another occasion, Green put his hands up and asked Pupil C to punch them. Although Pupil C did as instructed, Mr Green then grabbed Pupil C's right wrist and slapped Pupil C on the left cheek. Green also lifted a pupil above his head, and 'applied inappropriate sanctions to manage pupil behaviour' including making a pupil do press-ups in front of the class as a punishment, making them stand outside even if it was raining, confiscating mobile phones contrary to school policy and taking a pupil's jacket and not returning it for a week. Recommending a Prohibition Order, Professor Draper concluded: 'As a consequence of the findings of fact, it is the panel's conclusion that, whilst employed at St Thomas More Catholic College, Stoke-on-Trent between 2004 and 2012 Mr Green behaved in an inappropriate and bullying manner towards pupils.' Giving the final decision on behalf of the Secretary of State, Paul Heathcote said: 'The panel have found a number of allegations proven relating to Mr Green's behaviour towards pupils. 'The behaviour extended over a number of years and continued despite warnings. Mr Green's behaviour was a serious departure from the Teachers' Standards and impacted upon the wellbeing of pupils. 'The Panel have found evidence of a deep-seated attitude that leads to harmful behaviour and insufficient evidence that Mr Green recognises this. 'In all the circumstances a Prohibition Order is both a proportionate and appropriate sanction in this case.' Taking into account that Green's behaviour may have been exacerbated by poor health and personal issues, as well as testimonials provided and his recent good work, he set a minimum period of three years should pass before Green is allowed to apply for the Order to be set aside. The decision means that Green is banned from teaching in any school, sixth-form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England. He may apply for the Prohibition Order to be set aside, but not until November 2016, and if he does so will have to persuade a panel that he is fit to return to the classroom. He has a right of appeal to the High Court.","Paul Green, 39, swore at children and ordered them to do press ups .

Every time Britain manages to deport a foreign prisoner another one takes their place in jail - at an annual cost to the public of more than £300million. The Government’s spending watchdog found that, despite repeated promises by ministers to fix the mess, human rights laws and other problems were still leading to huge delays in booting out overseas offenders. In almost four in every ten cases studied by the National Audit Office, there was no prospect of imminent removal. The number of overseas offenders in the UK's prison system still hovers at the 11,000 mark (stock image) The result is that Britain’s jails are clogged with 11,000 foreign criminals. And as soon as the Home Office does manage to kick somebody out, there is another immigrant convicted of a crime and sent to jail to take their place. The annual bill for housing them in the packed prison estate is £308million. Overall, the total number of all foreign criminals removed by the Home Office – which includes ex-inmates or people given a community sentence – has fallen by 14 per cent over the past four years. In the final three months of 2009, 5,528 were removed, compared to 4,730 between April and June of this year. The NAO blamed ‘complex human rights issues’ for the failure to remove foreign prisoners. Keeping the foreign prisoners locked up in Britain costs £308million every year (stock image) Other factors included criminals hiding their true identities, EU free movement diktats and delays in getting travel documents. The report states: ‘Removals and new convictions are currently roughly equal to one another, meaning that the overall number of foreign national prisoners remains stable. ‘But removing more prisoners, or removing them earlier in their sentences, would significantly reduce costs. The cost of keeping 1,000 prisoners in prison is £28 million a year.’ Officials found that, in some cases, the Home Office was guilty of wasting time and public money. In one example, poor record keeping meant efforts were made to deport someone who had not been sentenced for a criminal offence and had earlier been granted asylum. Officials also pursue cases on the basis of when an offenders sentence is due to be concluded – rather than targeting those most likely to be removed. The watchdog found instances where the Home Office wasted time and public money (stock image) The NAO found that officials had a realistic chance of deporting a criminal within three months of their release date in only two per cent of cases. The report said the Home Office should prioritise cases better. Britain’s jails contain inmates from around 150 countries - three out of every four nations in the world. Cameron hailed a transfer agreement with EU countries designed to send more home. Ministers have been trying for years to find new ways of booting out foreign criminals. Under Labour, they included offering bribes of up to £1,500 each to any inmate who leaves voluntarily. In 2010, David Cameron promised to ‘intervene personally’ to fix the shambles. The Prime Minister hailed a transfer agreement with EU countries designed to send inmates home to serve their sentence. But, during the first year of operation, not a single inmate was removed. The two countries with the most inmates in Britain – Poland and Ireland – were given opt-outs by the previous Labour government. Earlier this year, Mr Cameron announced UK taxpayers are to fund a major prison building programme in poor countries such as Nigeria and Jamaica . Foreign criminals have been blamed for the overcrowding problems in our jails. Last Friday, the prison population was 85,429, with capacity at 85,938, leaving just 509 spare places. Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan said: ‘Latest Ministry of Justice figures show there are just 509 prison spaces left in England and Wales, with the system operating at over 99% of capacity. ‘Things are so bad that police stations and court cells might have to be used. Public confidence in our justice system will be massively damaged if there’s not enough space in prisons to lock up criminals.’","The number of overseas offenders in the UK's prison system at 11,000 .

Royal Bank of Scotland has been fined £62million for breaching US sanctions against Iran and other brutal regimes, in another day of shame for British banks. The State-backed lender reached the settlement with US authorities after it emerged that it has been concealing transactions with clients in Iran, Burma, Libya and Sudan for more than a decade. Employees in the UK were given a step-by-step guide on how to conceal the identity of these sanctioned countries, stripping details from transactions with clients. Fined: RBS breached sanctions on dealing with Iran and had been hiding deals with clients in Burma, Libya and Sudan since as early as 2002 . The cover up occurred from at least 2002 to 2011, with more than 3,500 US dollar transactions worth £320 million routed through US banks. The fine is split between the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve and New York state’s Department of Financial Services. Anger: New York governor Andrew Cuomo will continue the battle against the banks . Four senior RBS employees, including its head of anti-money laundering were fired after RBS launched its own internal investigation in 2010. Regulators said they were fully aware of the deceit and in some cases gave instructions to their employees. Last night the bank said it ‘deeply regrets these failings’, which US regulators said ‘threatened the safety and soundness of RBS and violated New York law.’ Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York said: 'We have a vital responsibility to combat misconduct at banks and continue strengthening the long-term integrity of the financial system. 'In New York, we will continue our aggressive work rooting out global money laundering that puts our national security at risk.’ RBS is just the latest British bank to be fined for breaching US sanctions against rogue nations. HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered have all reached settlements with US authorities, with Standard Chartered fined £415 million last year. It was accused of dealing with clients including Iranian state backed lenders suspected of financing terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, as well as Iran’s nuclear weapons programme.","RBS has been concealing transactions with Iran, Burma and Sudan .

Nick Pollard has admitted not including the claim that then-director general Mark Thompson knew about the Newsnight investigation into Savile . BBC chairman Chris Patten is facing claims he helped cover up key evidence about the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. For . three months, Lord Patten has been aware of a secret tape in which the . author of the official £3million inquiry into the debacle said he made a . ‘mistake’ in his final report. In . a recording leaked online yesterday, Nick Pollard admitted ignoring . bombshell claims suggesting the BBC’s former director-general was . specifically warned about the disgraced DJ’s sex abuse yet allowed . glowing tributes to be screened after Savile’s death. Despite . being handed a transcript of the conversation in September, Lord Patten . has repeatedly refused to reopen the investigation and even warned one . MP he could be sued if he attempted to publish it. At . the heart of the row is a conflict between one of the BBC’s most . powerful female executives, director of radio Helen Boaden, and former . director-general Mark Thompson, now chief executive of the New York . Times. Mr Thompson was in . charge of the BBC when a devastating TV report into Savile’s predatory . past was shelved, sparking a wave of recriminations that culminated in . the resignation of his successor. His . repeated assurances that he was never told about the sex-abuse . allegations were accepted by the Pollard inquiry. In the official report . published a year ago, Mr Pollard said he had ‘no reason to doubt Mr . Thompson’s account’. But in . the tape recording, Mr Pollard privately admitted to a journalist that . his report had been flawed. He had been handed a letter by lawyers . acting for Miss Boaden which directly contradicted Mr Thompson’s . evidence. She said she . warned Mr Thompson about the contents of the Newsnight investigation in a . phone call in December 2011, weeks before a Christmas tribute to Savile . aired. Mr Pollard was asked to examine the events which lead up to Newsnight abandoning its investigation into allegations of abuse against Savile, which were later revealed in an ITV documentary . Former BBC director of news Helen Boaden informed the Pollard review that she had told then-director-general Mark Thompson about a proposed Newsnight report into Savile - something Mr Thomson denies . The BBC Trust denied that chairman Lord Patten had threatened Tory MP Rob Wilson with legal action if he released the tape . In the recording, Mr . Pollard – who was paid £96,000 for eight weeks’ work – admits it was a . ‘mistake’ to leave the claims out of his report. Pressure is now growing . on Lord Patten to explain why he has not reopened the inquiry. He . was accused of trying to suppress the truth by warning  Tory MP Rob . Wilson, who tried to publish the recording this week, that he should be . ‘weighing up the legal liabilities that might arise’. Tory . MP Philip Davies, who sits on the Commons culture media and sport . committee, said the chairman’s position is ‘untenable’, adding: ‘Lord . Patten has become a joke. Any credibility he had left has completely . evaporated.’ Last night, the . BBC Trust said it was taking the recording ‘seriously’ and had passed . it on to Mr Pollard so he can give his version. A . spokesman added: ‘There was no legal threat – the letter merely . suggested Mr Wilson might want to satisfy himself the recording was not . defamatory, should he decide to release it.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Nick Pollard headed inquiry into why Newsnight dropped Savile report .

It had been hoped that the deal, which began in 2010, would continue until at least 2018, but Barclays has apparently told the Mayor that its sponsorship will end in 2015. The scheme, strongly supported by Mr Johnson, allows people to hire so-called ‘Boris bikes’ from ranks dotted across  the capital and then deposit them at  their destination. Sponsorship: The scheme, strongly supported by London Mayor Boris Johnson, allows people to hire so-called 'Boris bikes' from ranks dotted across the capital and then deposit them at their destination . Transport for London, which runs the bike scheme on the Mayor’s behalf, will now have to begin the search for a new sponsor to step in from 2015. A spokesman for Barclays said the decision was the result of a long-term analysis of the sponsorship agreement and had nothing to do with the spate of tragedies last month when six cyclists died in 13 days on London’s roads. In August this year 20-year-old French woman Philippine Degerin-Ricard became the first person to be killed riding a ‘Boris bike’ after she was struck by a lorry on Whitechapel High Street in East London. The bikes were launched amid much fanfare in August 2010. Around 8,000 bikes are now available from 570 docking stations.

Shaya Leigh, 18, (left) was twice over the legal alcohol limit when she crashed killing herself and Kerry Staniford, 17 . An inquest in Wiltshire heard that neither girl was wearing their seatbelt properly as they drove along a dual carriageway at 5am after an evening’s drinking. The car spun round and corkscrewed through the air, launching three of the passengers out as it careered 50 metres off the A419 outside Swindon. Kerry was thrown through the windscreen and into the path of the car while Shaya was found dead in the driver’s seat with the seatbelt only on her lap. Survivor Harry Livingstone, 20, who was in the middle rear seat, was thrown out of the back windscreen and ended up underneath the vehicle. Jake Gibbons, 20, was flung through the sun roof and landed 10 metres from the car. The only survivor left in their original position was Jordan Gilliver, 20, who was wearing his seat belt in the back. His head was forced out through the broken side window. An inquest in Wiltshire heard that neither girl was wearing their seatbelt properly as they tore along a dual carriageway at 5am after an evening's drinking . Jake and Jordan are still learning to walk nearly seven months after the accident on May 18 and have only recently returned home. The inquest heard how Shaya and Kerrylee had been drinking in Swindon’s Old Town before they went to pick up the three men. Jordan told the coroner: 'I have no memory of the crash itself. 'The day of the crash was my birthday, and the day before I had been at a party. 'Although . initially I did not have my seat belt on, I put it on because there was . a lot of messing about, and Shaya was playing with the brakes. 'At one point Kerry was dangling her legs out of the window of the car.' Jake . Gibbons described the moments before the crash and said: 'The car . suddenly veered off to the left. It left the road and started to turn . over. I have no memory after that.' Accident investigator Pc James . Trafford said: 'The car was travelling in lane two and had no other . traffic around it. There was a heavy braking mark on the road, for which . there is no visible reason. 'It . is clear that Shaya braked very hard, hard enough for the lock brakes . to kick in. She has then steered to the left harshly, about half a . second after putting on the brakes. 'The rear of the car then spun round and at that point Shaya would not have been able to recover control.' The drink-driver killed herself and her best friend by 'playing with the brakes' and flipping her car while driving at 87mph, the inquest in Swindon heard . The speed limit on the road is 70mph and he said the car’s estimated speed was between 73 and 87mph when Shaya suddenly braked. Motorist John Little, who was heading to Heathrow with his wife, said: 'I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. 'I looked out of my window and saw a small hatchback lift about two feet off the ground and roll over toward the driver’s side. 'I looked in my rear mirror and saw dust and debris flying up. I braked hard to turn and locate the car, but got lost.' Ian Singleton, the assistant coroner for Wiltshire: 'This is clearly a tragic incident involving the loss of two young girls’ lives. 'I would like to commend officers who attended the scene for preventing further loss of life.' A narrative verdict of death as a result of the road traffic accident was recorded for both victims.","Shaya Leigh, 18, was twice over the legal alcohol limit when she was driving .

From bizarre 'nerve nutrients' to strange contraptions that shot live electric currents through the body, the means used to treat mental illness weren't always the most pleasant. Now a new exhibition promises to reveal how doctors made the leap from tinctures crammed with phosphates to modern medicine over just 250 years. The exhibition, entitled Mind Maps: Stories from Psychology, also includes a section that focuses on the birth of radar, the driver for a number of breakthroughs in the early 20th century, and looks at the Victorian obsession with 'melancholia'. Painful: This electroconvulsive therapy machine was made in the 1940s for the Burden Neurological Institute . Other fascinating exhibits include a series of vintage nerve tonics, among them one named Huxley's Ner-Vigor, which claimed to strengthen the nerves, and the 'frog pistol', a bizarre contraption invented by German scientist Emil du Boise-Reymond to show the effect electricity had on dismembered frog's legs. The Science Museum, which is hosting the free exhibition, also included a grim-looking Ediswan electroconvulsive therapy machine, which was widely used between 1944 and 1960, in the display. Yet more objects show how early scientists attempted to understand the mind, frequently with the help of some very strange contraptions. Particularly odd is Fechner's double sound pendulum, which was invented by German scientists in 1898 and used by early psychologists to 'listen' to the thoughts of their patients. Fortifying: Sedating tonics such as Ner-Vigor and Spasmodene were thought to boost the nervous system . Bizarre: Fechner's double sound pendulum was thought to be able to pick up people's thoughts . Clever: The Frog Pistol, was devised by scientists to demonstrate the stimulation of nerves in a frog's leg . Equally strange is the chronoscope, an English invention used to measure the speed of thought with varying levels of success. Speaking about the exhibition, curator Phil Loring said: 'The quest to uncover the mysteries of the mind has . pre-occupied scientists for centuries and continues to do so in 2013 â€“ . where mental wellbeing remains a pressing topic in society. 'This . exhibition looks at how far weâ€™ve progressed in our understanding of the . mind and how treatments for mental health conditions have evolved over . the past three centuries.' Dr Richard Mallows, president of the British Psychological Society which is supporting the exhibition, added: 'I am delighted that the Society has had . the opportunity to work with the world renowned Science Museum to . support the development of this exhibition.

Andrew Kearns has lost his damages action for wrongful dismissal against Glencore UK Ltd . An oil trader sacked because he was said to be not in a fit state after a heavy night out in Singapore has lost his damages action for wrongful dismissal. Andrew Kearns, 38, was employed by Glencore UK Ltd from January 2009 until October 2010, when he was summarily dismissed for serious misconduct after missing a series of meetings on the business trip. Contesting the action at London’s High Court, Glencore said he failed to attend critical meetings in the morning, at lunchtime and in the afternoon of October 11 and it was the latest in a series of alcohol-related incidents. Mr Kearns agreed that he was out until 4.30am drinking with colleagues, but said it was not to greater excess than anyone else and the business meetings later that day did not require his compulsory attendance. Mr Kearns, of Rainham, Gillingham, Kent, received a signing-on bonus the equivalent of 325,000 US dollars (current value £202,000) when he joined the company and was on an annual salary of 225,000 US dollars (£140,000) plus other benefits. Mr Kearns, a married father of three, was not in court to hear Judge Richard Seymour QC make a costs order against him on the higher indemnity basis, with an interim payment due of £150,000. He said: 'This claim was ludicrous - it should never have been advanced.' At the start of the trial, the judge threw out the most valuable part of the claim - in respect of share options - as 'hopeless', leaving only the wrongful dismissal element which was worth £12,000 maximum. 'In those circumstances, this is about as abnormal a case of this type that one could imagine. There was no conceivable justification for any claim being made at any point.' Glencore’s counsel, Jonathan Cohen, had told the court that 'context is everything'. 'This is an industry where a mistaken decimal point might result in losses of a very substantial nature. An employer cannot be expected to allow an employee who allows himself to become inappropriately inebriated to remain in the workplace.' Asking for his client's costs today, Mr Cohen said: 'Mr Kearns was dishonest in his evidence. He sought to deny the inevitable. Mr Kearns was habitually drunk and that was the reason he so egregiously failed to perform the duties required of him. 'It was in Mr Kearns’s power to remedy his behaviour. When he went on that conference, he could have chosen not to go out until the early hours and get drunk and to turn up to the meetings he was required to, but he chose not to do that.' Contesting the action at London's High Court, Glencore said he failed to attend critical meetings and it was the latest in a series of alcohol-related incidents . He said that Glencore had made an offer to Mr Kearns earlier for him to discontinue the case, with each side paying its own costs. A relevant factor was Mr Kearns’s failure to accept the help Glencore offered, involving a doctor and a consultant who was a world expert on drug and alcohol addiction. Instead, he spent the next afternoon, when he should have been at work, in the pub. Mr Kearns, a married father of three, was not in court to hear Judge Richard Seymour QC make a costs order against him on the higher indemnity basis, with an interim payment due of £150,000 . 'This was a slap in the face for Glencore. This litigation is a slap in the face for Glencore. 'Mr Kearns has lost his job because of his own behaviour, his own very bad behaviour. 'Glencore did everything they could to help him during the employment until they got to the end of their tether. The tether would have been considerably shorter with the majority of employers. His dismissal was richly justified. 'Notwithstanding that, Glencore has then been forced to spend the best part of £400,000 defending a hopeless claim brought by someone who does not realise how tolerant Glencore were and how much they did to help.' Mr Cohen said that Mr Kearns’s absence record was 'appalling', being late or absent for at least 20 per cent of his service in London. His non-attendance at the conference was the final straw and he found himself between a rock and a hard place. Glencore’s case was that he was too drunk to attend while Mr Kearns’s was that he was not drunk, but stayed in bed as he had consumed too much and deliberately chose not to attend at least one of the meetings. Either way he was in repudiatory breach of contract. In his ruling, the judge said that Mr Kearns was an unsatisfactory witness, inclined to contest what, on the evidence, could not seriously be contested and to minimise the extent of his alcohol consumption and its consequences. He took no steps to limit his consumption or seek help but simply continued on his existing path, paying no regard to the adverse effects for Glencore. His approach could be summarised as 'doing it his way'. 'If, which I doubt, Mr Kearns did not simply sleep through the meetings which he missed, but consciously decided not to attend them, that in itself amounted to repudiatory breach of the contract which Glencore was entitled to accept by dismissing him summarily.'","Andrew Kearns was summarily dismissed for serious misconduct .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor and James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 11:09 EST, 11 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:09 EST, 11 December 2013 . Maternity and paternity pay for new parents will be included in a new cap on welfare spending, David Cameron admitted yesterday. The cost of the benefits, which are paid to mothers and fathers who take time off work to look after their children, is set to exceed £2.5billion a year within four years as more parents take them up. The Prime Minister confirmed that they will be covered by a new, overall cap on most welfare spending –  forcing the Treasury into a pledge that it would not cut them in the next Parliament. Rising: The cost of statutory maternity pay is expected to top £2.5billion by 2017-18, according to Treasury figures . David Cameron was accused of ‘picking . on’ working families after revealing that maternity and paternity pay . will not be protected from the limit on the total amount which can be . spent on benefits. The coalition has insisted the Government’s welfare squeeze must continue, and has challenged Labour to sign up to a new, permanent cap on most benefit spending before 2015. However, . government sources conceded that it would be open to future governments . to limit the costs of parental leave pay as part of the requirement on . them to keep overall benefit expenditure under control. The cap means . that if part of the benefits bill begins to spiral, the Treasury would . either have to cut it back or reduce other areas of welfare spending . instead. The inclusion of maternity pay means it could, in  theory, be . subject to further cuts. Chancellor George Osborne announced a cap on total benefits spending would start from 2015 after the precise limit is set out in spring next year. If the limit is breached ministers would have to explain it to Parliament and then allow MPs a vote. The basic state pension, which is costing £83billion this year, will be excluded along with Jobseekers Allowance, with the remaining £100billion of welfare spending capped. Admission: David Cameron said that all benefits had to be looked at to keep control of spending spending . It means that if parts of the benefits . bill suddenly increases – if there is a rise in unemployment, for . example – then other areas of spending would need to be cut. By including maternity pay spending in the cap, it could in theory be subject to cuts. Government sources insisted that maternity pay would be 'one of the last things' which would be affected by cutbacks. But . in last year's Autumn Statement Mr Osborne announced that maternity pay . would be uprated by just one per cent, instead of in line with . inflation, in a move dubbed the 'Mummy Tax'. Together . with JSA, income support, house benefit and statutory sick pay, the 1 . per cent increase for three years will save £1.43billion by 2014-15. New . mothers receive 90 per cent of their average salary for the first six . weeks of maternity leave, and £136.78 for the next 33 weeks. But the cost of providing the benefit has soared from £193million in 1987-88 to £2.4billion this year. Official Treasury forecasts suggest it will rise further, hitting £2.571billion by 2017-18. In the Commons Mr Cameron said the only spending exempt from a new welfare spending cap would be the state pension as Labour accused him of not being family friendly. The Prime Minister said it was important to distribute benefits held within the cap ‘properly’. Mothers currently receive 90 per cent of their salary for the first six weeks of maternity leave, and then £136.78 for the next 33 weeks . Labour policy on the welfare cap also descended into confusion. Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves told BBC's Daily Politics 'yes we would include state pensions' in the welfare cap. But shadow chancellor Ed Balls made clear that the £95billion bill for the basic state pension would not be subject to the overall limit on benefits spending. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'Rachel Reeves has let the cat out of the bag - Labour would rather cut the state pension than benefits. 'While the Conservatives have increased the state pension by £650 and are specifically excluding it from our welfare cap, Labour risk a return to the days of their 75p rises.' During Prime Minister's questions, . Labour MP Fiona O'Donnell asked: ‘While the Prime Minister is trying to . come over all family friendly can you confirm if maternity and paternity . pay will be included in the benefits cap announced in the Autumn . Statement?’ Mr Cameron . replied: ‘As the Chancellor announced at the time what is out of the . benefit cap is the basic state pension, I think that's important. ‘On . all other welfare spending what we have to do is make sure we are . distributing properly between the different sorts of welfare.’ Speaking . later, Ms O’Donnell told MailOnline: ‘The Prime Minister looked . extremely uncomfortable, no wonder that is trying to look like he is . working-family-friendly, talking about flexible maternity and paternity . leave when the reality for families under this government is very . difficult. ‘For him to talk about this being a family-friendly government is really a joke, but a joke in very poor taste. ‘They are good at grabbing headlines but not actually looking at the detail. ‘Yes, we need sensible welfare expenditure, we would support a cap. ‘But . at the same time you have to balance that with meeting need and this is . where the government I think has really got it wrong. ‘When . they use the language of skivers and defrauding the system we are also . talking about people trying to provide for their families in very . difficult times. ‘Why is he picking on families that are working hard to try to get on in life?’ Downing Street later said the welfare cap ‘obliges the Government and future governments to look across the board at welfare pressures to ensure that there is fairness on taxpayers. Asked whether a baby boom could result in cuts to maternity pay because of the cap, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ‘The point about the welfare cap is to be able to consider the pressures that there are across the welfare system to ensure that it is always affordable. ‘The parts of the welfare budget that are not in the welfare cap are the ones around the automatic stabilisers.’","Prime Minister challenged in the Commons over new benefit limits .

"By . James Chapman and Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 18:31 EST, 11 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:34 EST, 11 December 2013 . Betting shop managers are being told their wages are to be directly linked to how much cash punters pour in to a new generation of high stakes gaming machines branded a ‘social cancer’. A leaked memo reveals that staff at one of Britain’s biggest bookmakers have been told ‘higher weighting’ is to be attached to profits from fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). Critics of the machines, which allow users to wager up to £100 a spin every 20 seconds, say they are highly addictive and make casino-style gambling accessible on the high street. Leak: The move by Betfred will fuel growing calls for the Government to curb the terminals . Britain’s 33,000 FOBTs – branded the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling – have been under mounting scrutiny in recent months. They are increasingly key to the bookmaking industry, now raking in more than £1billion a year in profit. The move by Betfred will fuel growing calls for the Government to curb the terminals. Campaigners want stakes to be cut to a maximum of £2, a reduction in spin rates and a ban on offers of free stakes intended to draw in new punters. Betfred, named after its co-founder Fred Done, has 1,375 betting shops across the country, in locations ranging from inner cities to leafy suburbs and rural towns. An internal company memo, setting out a proposed ‘restructure announcement’, shows sales managers will attract ‘per hour’ supplements of 25p, 75p or £1.25 depending on how their shop is graded on three performance indicators. As well as traditional over-the-counter slips and stakes, it says they will include ‘FOBT gross profit (which will attract a higher weighting)’. The Daily Mail has also seen documents suggesting that some Betfred stores intend to trade until 9pm on Christmas Eve, Boxing Day, New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, hours after racing has finished – though the firm insisted last night the vast majority would now close at 6.30pm. Gambling machine: calls are growing to restrict the stakes and prizes available on fixed-odds betting machines . Adrian Parkinson, from the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said: ‘The proposed restructure is cynically aimed at incentivising shop staff to increase revenue from addictive digital roulette machines in order to increase their hourly wage. It entirely contradicts their commitment to social responsibility.’ Labour MP Tom Watson said: ‘This is an utterly cynical and avaricious measure that is ruining horse racing, destroying bookmaking and creating problem gamblers.’ Conservative MP Stewart Jackson said: ‘There has been significant criticism of the pernicious effect these machines are having. We need to think about the impact not just on problem gamblers but their families.’ A spokesman for Betfred said: ‘Betfred has announced to its staff a proposed restructuring of the company’s shop estate, which we believe will help drive the business forward and give all our employees a defined career path. It is however incorrect to state that the grading of the shops is based purely on gross profit from the fixed odds betting terminals. ‘The grading is based on three factors that reflect the business of a high street betting shop: the number of over-the-counter slips taken, over-the-counter stakes, and gross profit from the fixed odds betting terminals. To do otherwise would be unfair on our staff.’ The Gambling Commission says it is taking time to review FOBTs.","Memo says 'higher weighting' attached to fixed-odds betting terminals .

Sarah Pilkington, 34, is accused of ill-treating elderly dementia patients at the Plymouth care home where she worked . A worker in a care home was aggressive with elderly dementia patients and behaved 'as if she was fighting someone in a bar' rather than helping vulnerable people, a court heard. Sarah Pilkington, 34, who is accused of ill-treating people lacking mental capacity, abused, smacked and threatened 'to deck' patients at the Plymouth care home where she worked, it was alleged. The brunette is said to have wrenched an 88-year-old man’s arm and swore at him when he refused to get dressed, 'smacked or swiped' another elderly man’s hands, and threatened a 74-year-old woman for spilling tea. Plymouth Crown Court heard that Pilkington’s behaviour was more like someone 'picking a fight in a bar' than a care worker looking after vulnerable pensioners. Pilkington, of Devonport, denies four counts of ill-treating people lacking mental capacity at Plymouth’s Hartley Park Care Home, where she worked as a care assistant. Prosecutor Llewellyn Sellick said the three victims were all vulnerable dementia patients who were unable to give evidence themselves. But he told jurors that Pilkington’s 'aggressive' behaviour had been witnessed by colleagues who were disgusted by the distress she caused. The first alleged abuse happened in April or May 2012 when Pilkington was taking an 88-year-old man to the lavatory. Kelly Hogan, another care assistant, told the court that Pilkington pulled him around 'aggressively' when he resisted. Miss Hogan said she felt 'upset and disgusted' by what she had witnessed. She told jurors that on another occasion she saw Pilkington put her face close to a 74-year-old woman who had poured tea over a colleague. Miss Hogan said: 'She went into her face and said ‘Nobody does that to my [expletive] mate.’' Staff at the Hartley Park Care Home in Plymouth told the court that Pilkington behaved aggressively to patients . The court heard Pilkington clashed again with the same 88-year-old when he became aggressive and refused to get dressed. Suzanna Theobald, formerly a mental health nurse at the home, said Pilkington 'wrenched' at his arm, pulling it up roughly, and swore back at him. Mrs Theobald said: 'I can’t remember the exact words she was using but she was certainly using swear words. It started to feel very threatening. 'It was like she was fighting someone in a bar rather than caring for a very vulnerable adult in a nursing home. 'It was like she was fighting someone in a bar rather than caring for a very vulnerable adult in a nursing home.' - Suzanna Theobald, mental health nurse at the home . 'I was starting to get very upset and very uncomfortable. He tried to hit out at her. She said ""I will deck you’ or something along those lines.""' The court heard the incident was reported to police who began an investigation into Pilkington. On Boxing Day last year she allegedly lashed out at a different 88-year-old man who tried to move a chair. Care assistant Joanna Smith said she saw Pilkington smack or swipe his hands while calling him an offensive name several times. Miss Smith told the court: 'I was disgusted at what was happening.' Kelly Scrivener, defending, challenged each witness and said none of the incidents had happened. She told Miss Hogan and Miss Smith that they would have reported her behaviour immediately had it been as they described in court. And she said Mrs Theobald made up the complaint about Pilkington because the pair had argued over switching off patient alarms at night. Pilkington denied roughing up patients and told police she had been ‘stitched up like a right kipper’, the court heard. Plymouth Crown Court heard that Pilkington denied roughing up patients and said she had been 'done up like a kipper' The court was told she has previous convictions for theft, benefit fraud, handling stolen goods and dangerous driving dating back to 1995 when she was just 15. But Pilkington said she had turned her life around since having her first daughter in 2004 and had not committed a crime for 10 years. The mother-of-two said: ‘I’m not that person any more. I’m not that scally teenager I was then.’ Pilkington claimed former colleagues had lied about her abusing patients, but prosecutor Llewellyn Sellick told her: ‘I suggest these convictions demonstrate that it’s you who is indeed dishonest and it’s you who is telling the lies in this court.’ She denied slapping an 88-year-old patient’s wrists and repeatedly calling him a ‘p****’ after he approached her in a lounge area last Boxing Day. She told the jury the pair had a good relationship and would often ‘sit down and share a takeaway and watch the telly’. In another alleged incident Pilkington is said to have wrenched a different 88-year-old resident’s arm making the bones in his shoulder ‘creak’. But Pilkington said there was no truth in the allegation and that she merely had a bit of ‘banter’ with the vulnerable resident. It was also claimed that when a senior colleague asked her about a complaint she replied that she did not ‘give a f***’ about patients. The court was read out a recording of the interview where Pilkington denied all the allegations and told the police she had been ‘stitched up like a right kipper’. Gemma Poulding, an ex-colleague of Pilkington, told the court she was a hard worker with a bubbly personality, and said she had never seen Pilkington ill-treat, abuse or threaten any of the residents.

A shopping centre has been forced to apologise to a mother after Santa threatened to 'report' her because her child was too light. Theresa Stewart, 20, took her four-year-old daughter Lily to visit Father Christmas at the Eastgate Shopping Centre, in Gloucester. She said she watched in amazement after Lily hopped onto Santa’s knee  - only for him to comment on how small she was for her age - and then go on to quiz her about her diet. Theresa Stewart, 20, took her daughter, Lily Smith, to visit Father Christmas at a nearby shopping centre. But the mother was left shocked after the youngster took her seat on Santa's knee and was told that she was too light . Retail assistant Ms Stewart  - who is herself a petite 4ft 9in - said Father Christmas then told Lily he would 'report your mummy'. The shocked mother said: 'Santa asked my daughter how old she was and she said she was four. 'He said ""You are small for four - what did you eat for breakfast"". She said she had an egg sandwich, because she has problems eating - it’s what she eats. 'He said ""I’m going to report your mummy"". Obviously this meant social services.' Ms Stewart, from Gloucester, paid £5 for Lily to see Santa and a further £8 for her to receive a gift.

Dale Cregan: Police call-handler Kathryn Smith fed secret information to her boyfriend, Sean Booth, during the police hunt for the killer, a court heard today . A police call-handler fed secret information to her boyfriend during the massive manhunt for his friend Dale Cregan, a court heard today. Kathryn Smith, 25, a civilian with Greater Manchester Police, used the police's computer systems while on her shift at force HQ to check developments in Operation Dakar - the hunt to find the one-eyed killer, it is alleged. She passed information on to her boyfriend Sean Booth, 31, who lived on the same street and grew up with Cregan, which was shared with the killer's mother Anita Cregan, 56. All three deny a single count of misconduct in a public office, Smith by looking for and disclosing confidential information, and Booth and Cregan by aiding and abetting her to commit the offence. At the time of the alleged offence by the defendants, Dale Cregan was the prime suspect in the murders of father and son David and Mark Short, prosecutor Nicholas Clarke QC told Manchester Crown Court. Mark Short was shot dead in the Cotton Tree Pub in Droylsden on May 25 last year and his father gunned down and blown up with a hand grenade at his home in Clayton, Manchester, 11 weeks later. A £50,000 reward was put up for the arrest of Cregan, considered 'extremely dangerous' by police, the court heard. Officers swamped east Manchester and Droylsden, where Cregan lived, and bugged the Cregan family home on Sutton Drive, the jury heard. At the same time Smith would go into work and 'habitually' monitor events in the area, looking at information and maps on police computers that she, as a call handler, was not supposed to access. 'Whenever the system took her away to deal with a call from a different area, she would almost immediately drag it back to Droylsden,' Mr Clarke told the court. Cregan killed PC Fiona Bone, 32, left, and PC Nicola Hughes, 23, in a gun and grenade attack last year . 'She concentrated on the high level of police activity surrounding the manhunt for Dale Cregan and the Sutton Drive area where his family reside. Smith's role does not permit her to act this way.' The jury was shown screen-shots of her computer use on the evening of 4 September last year, showing how Smith viewed details of a call taken by police giving details of a possible sighting of Cregan on Manchester Road in Droylsden . She allegedly used her computer to look up the exact locations of all the officers and police cars and vans in the area and accessed maps showing armed response patrols in the vicinity. Smith, of Condor Close, Droylsden, and Booth and Cregan, both of Sutton Drive, Droylsden, all deny the offence, allegedly committed between September 1 2011 and September 9 2012. The trial continues.

A culture of ruthless mis-selling at Lloyds Bank was laid bare yesterday as the State-backed lender was fined a record £28million by the City watchdog. In an explosive report, the Financial Conduct Authority revealed how Lloyds salesmen had been promised ‘champagne bonuses’ for ripping off customers by selling them products they did not want or need. In some cases workers were told their pay would be halved if they did not hit targets for selling the worthless products. Sale fail: Lloyds Bank has been handed a record £28million fine by the Financial Conduct Authority for ripping off their customers . One salesman was so desperate to meet his target he sold insurance to himself, his wife and a colleague to prevent his salary from being cut. Last night MPs called for chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio to be stripped of his £2.5million bonus, awarded last month, saying it was ‘an extraordinary award for gross incompetence and fleecing his own customers’. They said the bank – which was bailed out with £20billion of taxpayers’ money in 2008 – had failed to learn from the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, which has saddled it with an £8billion compensation bill so far. The report came on a day of shame for Britain’s State-backed banks, with RBS separately handed a £62millon fine in America for making illegal deals with Iran. Shamed: MPs have called for Lloyds' CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio to be stripped of his £2.5million bonus, awarded last month . The Financial Conduct Authority’s shocking findings included: . The fine given to Lloyds dwarfs the previous record of £10.5million, jointly held by HSBC and credit card insurer CPP. Tracey McDermott, the FCA’s director of enforcement and financial crime, said: ‘Customers have a right to expect better from our leading financial institutions and we expect firms to put customers first. But firms will never be able to do this if they incentivise their staff to do the opposite.’ Retired nurse Kathleen Coackley is a victim of Lloyds’ bonus-driven culture. The 67-year-old from  Cheadle in Cheshire walked into a branch of the bank simply to ask about a loan to buy a car. But during her visit an adviser pulled up her bank details and pressured her into putting the £27,000 she had saved to fund her retirement into a complex investment linked to the stock market. She was told it was no-risk and she would make a big profit, but when the investment matured she received just £100 profit. Mrs Coackley would have received more by putting her cash into an ordinary savings account. She said: ‘I have never changed banks and have trusted them implicitly with my salary and savings over the years. Not for a moment, despite all the banking horror stories, did I think they would cheat me.’ After initially fobbing off Mrs Coackley’s complaint, Lloyds agreed to pay her £4,000 in compensation. The wrongdoing occurred between January 2010 and March 2012, when Lloyds embarked on a major push to sell more insurance products because they were so profitable. These included critical illness policies, that are supposed to pay out a lump sum if a customer is diagnosed with a serious illness. The probe did not include payment protection insurance, which Lloyds stopped selling in July 2010. The FCA’s investigation also focused on sales of risky stock market investments, such as shares Isas, as well as highly complex investments called structured products. During this period, advisers from Lloyds TSB, Halifax and Bank of Scotland – all part of Lloyds Banking Group – sold 1.1 million of these products to more than 690,000 customers. To boost sales, the bank changed the way it paid its staff so they were encouraged to sell as many of these policies as possible. This included introducing ‘variable basic salaries’ where salesman who hit their targets could automatically be promoted and get a pay rise. Those who fell short would automatically be demoted and get a pay cut. The FCA said ‘the risks to customer’ posed by advisers struggling to hit their targets were ‘particularly acute’. But the rewards for those who did make the grade were handsome, with Lloyds TSB salesmen receiving bonuses of up to £6,389 a month. These protection products were also hugely lucrative for the bank, which earned £600 commission for each sale. Seven in ten Lloyds TSB advisers received their monthly bonus even though the bank had identified that many of their sales were unsuitable. Last night Conservative MP Mark Garnier said: ‘Clearly the embedded culture of mis-selling has not been cleared away since the financial crisis. The evidence is Lloyds has learned nothing from the PPI mis-selling crisis.’ And the bank came under pressure to strip Mr Horta-Osorio of his £2.5million shares bonus – awarded last month for his work in 2012. Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘There won’t be a taxpayer in Britain who thinks he should get this money. 'He should pay every penny back. This is an extraordinary award for gross incompetence and fleecing his own customers.’ Lloyds has been ordered to review sales to all these customers and pay compensation where necessary. It has set aside £100million to pay the fine and compensation, as well as the cost of the review. In a rare move, the FCA said it had increased the bank’s fine by 10 per cent because it had ignored a warning about its sales culture a decade ago from the previous watchdog, the Financial Services Authority. A bank spokesman said: ‘The Group recognises that its oversight of these particular schemes during the period in question was inadequate and apologises.’","Bank handed record fine by City watchdog for misselling products .

Chequered past: Ashley Blake, 44, lost his job as a presenter on BBC Midlands Today after being convicted of violent wounding . A former BBC presenter turned HGV driver caused rush-hour chaos after trying to squeeze his over-sized lorry through the Dartford Tunnel. Ashley Blake, 44, said he was as irritated as everyone else until he realised that it was his 17ft-tall double-decker lorry causing the blockage. The former Watchdog presenter is still getting used to driving HGVs after only qualifying for his licence two weeks ago. He made the unlikely career change after being fired by the BBC following his conviction for attacking a teenager. Warning lights were triggered as he approached the tolls during the rush-hour last Wednesday because the 17ft high lorry was too big for the M25 river crossing. Mr Blake, from Birmingham, said: 'I was coming back to the Midlands from Rochester and it was my first time in that part of the country dragging this oversized vehicle. 'I was just about to enter the tunnel when on the left hand side the matrix signs started flashing like crazy. 'I thought ""Oh what an idiot"" at whoever was causing the blockage and as soon as that thought entered my mind, I thought ""Oh my God, it’s me"".' He explained he was forced to stop and display hazard warning lights. All the toll booths had to be closed before he could reverse the 46ft long trailer half a mile back from the tunnel. 'It was highly embarrassing,' he said. 'It called upon all of my skills to . reverse this oversized trailer back half a mile while red-faced.' Tight squeeze: Blake had only qualified for his HGV driver's licence two weeks before the incident . Mr . Blake took to Facebook to apologise to other road users who had got stuck in the . jam he had caused, stating: 'I’m sorry to all the rush hour commuters. 'The only mitigation I can offer is . that this is the first time I’ve visited this part of the country in an . “oversized vehicle""'. But as expected, Mr Blake experienced the full wrath of the angry motorists who watched him reverse at the time. He . said: 'Some of the words they were saying are unprintable. I could . understand that because I used to live in London and I know how annoying . it can be. 'Unfortunately, this time I was the idiot. I confess and seek forgiveness.'

These pictures show the giant hostel for refugees set up by the mayor of Calais to keep them safe from the elements as they wait to cross the channel to Britain. The building in the port city has been converted from a former dockers' social club, and has space for 120 asylum seekers, mostly from Africa and the Middle East. The refugees must sleep on mattresses on the floor, packed so closely together that it is almost impossible to walk between them. Camp: This is the £70,000 winter shelter for refugees in Calais hoping to travel to Britain . Shelter: The refugees, mostly from Africa and the Middle East, are given sleeping bags to keep them warm . Converted: The building used to be a social club for dockers before being reopened as a refuge . The £70,000 winter refuge provides migrants with running water, heating and a sanitary block. The town's mayor Natacha Bouchart opened the shelter last week after saying the number of people crossing the Channel had become 'untenable'. They have also been provided with sleeping bags to help them fend off the cold winter weather. Signs on the wall ban residents from drinking, smoking and fighting - suggesting that authorities are worried about the possibility of tempers boiling over as the migrants wait to enter the UK. Warning: Signs at the shelter instruct residents not to drink, smoke or fight on the premises . Instructions: The shelter will provide a home for 120 refugees when temperatures drop below freezing . The . camp - situated in the centre of Calais - is similar in concept to the . infamous Sangatte asylum centre, which attracted thousands of UK-bound . migrants before it was closed by the . French authorities in 2002. It opened its doors early last Thursday to a queue of more than 100 Syrians, Eritreans and Afghans. The . migrants had been forced to beg for shelter due to stormy winds which . had blown away their makeshift tents pitched within walking distance of . the Channel ferry terminal. Billed as a ‘humanitarian gesture’, the camp will remain open to migrants from 6.30pm to 9am when temperatures fall below freezing during the day and minus 5 at night . Controversy: The shelter was opened because Calais is apparently struggling to cope with the influx of migrants . Halfway house: Many of the migrants staying at the shelter are expected to claim asylum in Britain . However, its opening has sparked anger among a group of residents calling itself ‘Save Calais’. The . outraged locals plan a sit-in demonstration in front of the Town Hall . to protest at the port falling prey to ‘massive immigration’. Last week, it emerged that Calais's council has been forced to employ a security firm to patrol the seafront to prevent desperate migrants from breaking into beach huts. The immigrants were also sleeping rough on sand dunes and inhabiting the town's parks. Currently: Migrants sleep in makeshift tents pitched near the Channel ferry terminal in Calais, France.

The largest squat - situated at Boulevard Victor Hugo - belongs to an 80-year-old woman. It was occupied by the British anarchist group No Borders and is currently home to up to 90 migrants.

Thieves have cut down and taken a Christmas tree planted in memory of an eight-year-old boy who drowned on holiday. The heartless theft has distressed the parents of Jak Taylor who decided that the tree would be the best way of remembering their son because he loved the festive season. Friends and relatives raised £350 to buy the fir tree, which was planted on the village green in Bilsthorpe, Nottingham, where he was from. Parents Dave and Lisa Taylor are devastated after thieves hacked down a Christmas tree planted in memory of their son, Jak, who drowned in a hotel swimming pool in Mallorca in August 2002 . Jak was eight years old when he was found dead in a hotel swimming pool in Mallorca, and the family have returned every Christmas to decorate and take pictures in front of the tree. But all that remains now is a ragged stump, which left his mother Lisa Taylor speechless when she saw it. Police are now hunting the people who stole the tree but his devastated mother has called on the thieves to hand themselves in. ‘My daughter Beth saw it on Facebook on Saturday morning. I just couldn’t believe it so we drove down there to have a look,' said the 40-year-old. ‘When we got there, I was speechless. I just didn’t know what to say. I called my mum. I first thought people had got it wrong as no one from the village could have done this.’ The idea for planting a Christmas tree in memory of Jak was suggested by the mother of one of his friends because of his love for Christmas. Mrs Taylor added: ‘The first year so many people went down to see the tree people couldn’t get near to it. ‘When the lights on each year we go down as a family and take pictures. ‘It is always a difficult time of year for us, I hate Christmas now. If it hadn’t been for the girls I would have stopped celebrating Christmas. ‘I really hope whoever has done this is caught.’ The tree (left) cost the friends and family of Jak Taylor (right) £350 and was planted on the village green . The tree was planted by the parish council three years ago - before then, a fir was planted each year in memory of Jak and then taken down. Chairman Andrea Swallow, 63, said: ‘We just can’t believe anyone would do this. ‘People have been so impressed by it this year because it has got a lot bigger.’ After hearing about the tree being stolen, Sue Massey from Arnold, Nottinghamshire, has offered for one of the trees in her garden to be planted instead. It is expected the replacement tree will be planted on Saturday. The tree is thought to have been stolen between 7pm last Friday, December 6, and 8am on Saturday, December 7.

The thief worked with ‘ninja-like’ speed and precision...and an audacity that suggests he perhaps did not know he was on camera. These pictures show how a masked raider prised the door of an art gallery open with a crowbar, snatched two Damien Hirst paintings and was gone again in under a minute. The pieces, worth £33,000, had only just gone up in the shop in Notting Hill, West London. Thief in the night: This is the moment two signed Damian Hirst works of art worth £33,000 were stolen from the gallery . Out the door: The robber used a crow-bar to break into the Notting Hill gallery before driving off at around 3am on Monday . Stolen art: This signed Damien Hirst piece, Pyronin Y, has been taken in the night from a west London gallery and is said to be worth £15,000 . The heist in the early hours of Monday . morning has left police mystified as the thief picked the pieces over . more valuable works by the award-winning artist. He . took two similar paintings, Pyronin Y, which was completed in 2005 and . is worth £15,000, and Oleoylsarcosine, from 2008 and worth £18,000. Hirst’s series of spot paintings, categorised by colourful dots in . different patterns, are among his most widely recognised works. Snatched: The smaller but more valuable piece, Oleoylsarcosine, on the left, was also taken in the early hours of Monday morning . Last . night, investigators were studying CCTV footage captured over the past . week to see if the thief made an earlier reconnaissance trip to the . gallery. One line of inquiry is he was working for a criminal who wanted to add the distinctive pieces to his collection. Gallery manager Nathan Engelbrecht, 31, said: ‘The police think it might have been stolen to order. ‘It . is also possible they targeted the Hirst spot pieces because he knew . they would be easier to sell. There are more expensive items here. There . is also another Hirst painting – not a spot one – but he left that . behind even though it was right next to one of them.’ The Exhibition Gallery, which opened in September, has a burglar alarm but it didn’t go off. The . gallery manager said the paintings had only gone up a few days ago . after weeks of negotiation with Hirst’s team. ‘We are a small gallery . and we had to convince them we could sell them and keep them safe,’ said . Mr Engelbrecht. ‘Looks like we failed at both.’ The CCTV shows that at . the same time as the raid, delivery men were outside a restaurant across . the road. Mr Engelbrecht said from the footage it is clear the thief . knew what he was looking for. ‘He was in and out within a minute,’ he . said. Scene of crime: The incident happened at around 3am on Monday where this gallery was broken into and the art taken. Manager Nathan Engelbrecht (pictured) has said it was without a working alarm . Upset: Mr Engelbrecht said the thieves had crow-barred open the front door before ripping the art off the walls . High profile: Damien Hirst at the Tracey Emin dinner in Florida last week. His works are regularly among the most valuable produced by a British artist . ‘If you watch it on . CCTV he knows exactly what he’s doing. He was completely covered up – . balaclava, hood, goggles, gloves. It was clearly a professional job. It . was all done with ninja-like speed and precision. ‘It is quite unbelievable how brazen he was because this is a busy street, even in the middle of night.’ The . glass-fronted shop is two doors down from Notting Hill Book Shop – the . inspiration for Richard Curtis’s hit film Notting Hill. Det . Sgt Jon Lightfoot of the Met said: ‘It appears the suspect has . specifically targeted the two pieces. They would have been visible in . the back of the car and we are appealing for witnesses to come forward.’ A spokesman for Hirst said: ‘This is a police matter and I’m afraid we cannot comment.’ Anyone with information is asked to contact the Serious Acquisitive Crime Unit at Notting Hill Police Station on 020 8246 0230 or, to remain anonymous, Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Long considered the bad boy of British art, Bristol born Damien Hirst's rise to the top has been remarkable. Despite achieving only a grade E in his art A-Level, the 48-year-old was at the forefront of the Young British Artists movement in the nineties. After setting up an art factory producing work that made him famous, he is the world’s wealthiest living artist, with a reported fortune of £215million. Prices for Hirst’s works, which include animal carcasses preserved in formaldehyde, spot paintings and medicine cabinet sculptures, have fallen sharply recently - down by 30 per cent since their 2008 peak. One in three of his pieces has failed to sell at all. Hirst, who is worth more than £200milliom, poses in front of one of the joint pieces he created with photographer David Bailey . Celebrated work: Hirst's Medicine cabinets on view at the Gagosian Gallery in Kings Cross, London in 2006 .

His most famous work is the 'The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living' from 1991, a shark in formaldehyde, which sold for $12m in 2005. Another controversial piece is 'For the Love of God', consisting of a real human skull studded with 8,601 diamonds. It was put up for sale at £50m in 2007 and acquired by a consortium. Art dealer and collector Charles Saatchi was an early fan and offered Hirst a £50,000 commission to do whatever he liked, resulting in the famous shark in formaldehyde.

But his curators skinned it, got rid of the decomposing body and stretched the skin over a fibreglass mould and it was sold to an American collector for around $12 million. Other works using formaldehyde include a dead cow and calf split in two and exhibited in separate glass containers and dead sheep. A series of 'spin' paintings were criticised as childish with even Hirst himself admitting to having seen the technique demonstrated on Blue Peter. He is unmarried and has three children with long-term girlfriend Maia Norman.","Thieves took Pyronin Y and Oleoylsarcosine from building in west London .

'Bad mother': Jamie Lynn Bentley, 33, a mother of eight, is accused of feeding her 8-week-old son only 2 ounces of food every six hours until he lost 2lbs off his birth weight . A 33-year-old mother of eight from Georgia has been arrested and charged with starving her newborn baby until he was nothing but skin and bones. Jamie Lynn Bentley, of Lithia Springs, was ordered held in the Douglas County Jail without bond Monday. She is facing one count of felony cruelty to children. According to an arrest report, Miss Bentley failed to adequately feed her 8-week-old son, causing him to lose 2lbs since his birth. The severely malnourished infant had to spend a week in a hospital so he could regain weight. The report from the Douglas County Sheriff's Office stated that Bentley, who also has seven older children, had fed her newborn son only 2 ounces of baby formula every six hours. Douglas County Assistant District Attorney Kristi Wilson said in court last Friday that caseworkers have been involved with the family since the baby boy was born due to strong suspicions that Bentley was a drug addict. ‘It [the baby] was skin and bones,’ Wilson said, according to Douglas County Sentinel. ‘Certain people have seen the pictures and that’s what it was. They couldn’t even recognize it was a baby in the pictures.’ Bentley's other children were also taken from her. The 33-year-old woman delivered her son in October and was staying at Children’s at Scottish Rite Pediatric Hospital so she could get help feeding the baby. According to Wilson, when hospital staff came into her room to wake her up, she declared that she was not going to feed the baby every two hours because it 'drove her crazy.' She was later asked to leave the medical center. Safe haven: The 33-year-old woman delivered her son in October and was staying at Children's at Scottish Rite Pediatric Hospital to get help feeding the baby . Two weeks ago, a nurse with the Department of Families and Children Services visited Bentley's Lithia Springs home and weighed the baby, discovering that he had shed 2lbs off his birth weight. According to officials, the child was so emaciated that he was eating his own muscle mass. Bentleys has denies allegations of cruelty, claiming that her son lost the weight in a matter of three days, prompting her to schedule an appointment with his pediatrician. However, health professionals told caseworkers that the little boy had been in a state of starvation for a while, and that it was not a sudden drop in weight.","Jamie Lynn Bentley, of Georgia, allegedly fed baby only 2 ounces of food every six hours until he lost 2lbs .

David Cameron has risked angering Tory Eurosceptics by refusing to appoint a powerful figure to spearhead a renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU. The Prime Minister insisted Foreign Secretary William Hague and Europe minister David Lidington were ‘making good progress’ and headed ‘one of the most expert groups of people I could have’. There have been growing calls from Conservative MPs suspicious of the Foreign Office’s attitude to Brussels for Mr Cameron to bring in a senior Eurosceptic to start talks with other EU leaders. Pressure: David Cameron, addressing reporters at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg today, is facing criticism at home from Eurosceptic Tory MPs . Those touted for the post have included former Cabinet minister Liam Fox and backbench MP Andrea Leadsom, one of the leaders of the ‘Fresh Start’ group of MPs who have been working on a blueprint for a looser, more trade-based relationship with the EU. Others Tory MPs have suggested that a leading figure from business should be brought in to fill the role. But Mr Cameron, asked if he intended to appoint an EU renegotiator, said: ‘I have got in William Hague and his team probably one of the most expert groups of people I could have. ‘I think David Lidington as the Europe minister played a huge role working in this area and I think we are making good progress.’ David Cameron . The Prime Minister said that critics had expressed doubts about the Government’s strategy when he first set out plans for a renegotiation followed by an ‘in/out’ referendum on Britain’s EU membership earlier this year. ‘Some people said at the time, “well I am not sure you will bring the business community along with this argument”. I think we broadly have - we have very strong support for negotiate and then decide with a referendum. ‘A lot of people said “well you won't get a lot of support amongst European countries for this agenda”. In fact if you read what a number of my colleagues have said there is an understanding of what Britain is trying to achieve not just for herself but the whole European Union. So I am satisfied. ‘Also, since that stage there have been some quite positive developments. The fact that we have actually cut the European budget, I think that is important, the business taskforce on deregulation, I think that is important. ‘So I think we have a very strong team, it is work done between the Chancellor, the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. We are absolutely taking the lead on this issue because it is so important for the future of our country but I am satisfied with the way it is going.’ Backing: The Prime Minister insists Foreign Secretary William Hague (left) is the right person to lead the negotiations . Eurosceptic Tory backbencher Douglas Carswell expressed concern about the Prime Minister’s remarks. ‘It is very unlikely that the Foreign Secretary or the Europe Minister are even minded to get a great new deal for us, let alone likely to get one,’ Mr Carswell said. ‘The official mindset of the Foreign Office exercises a very powerful grip on ministers. The only thing that can shore up British membership is a very radical and anti-establishment renegotiation. I don’t think the establishment can deliver that.’ Mr Carswell said Mr Cameron’s refusal to appoint a special envoy to spearhead renegotiation would increase the chances of a British exit from the EU. ‘That makes it far easier for me, when the time comes, to persuade undecided voters to leave,’ he added. Bill Cash, chairman of the Commons European scrutiny committee, said Britain needed an ‘absolutely A1 negotiating team’. ‘Those of us who were there in 1990 would be best placed to make the right judgements. If you want to deal with this properly there has to be fundamental change and the evidence is that they are just nibbling at the treaties.’ Mr Lidington yesterday wrote to a group Tory party members who had drawn up a ‘shopping list’ of EU reforms for the forthcoming renegotiation. Team: Europe minister David Lidington (left) has written to a group Tory party members who had drawn up a ¿shopping list¿ of EU reforms for the forthcoming renegotiation . In his letter, reported by the Spectator magazine, the minister focused on the prospect of Europe-wide reform, rather than the likelihood of a new relationship with the EU for the UK. ‘Since the Prime Minister’s speech the debate across Europe has begun to shift: more and more national leaders are talking about powers coming back from Brussels. That is not to say that great challenges don’t remain: they do,’ he wrote. Mr Lidington insisted that Britain has been ‘leading the charge’ on making the EU more competitive, pointing to progress towards a streamlined process for patents across Europe and capping roaming charges for mobile phone users. He said the UK wants a new structure of EU membership that accommodates those still keen to pursue its founding principle of ‘ever closer union’ as well as those, like Britain, who do not. ‘We want an end to the obligation on all  EU members to subscribe to an “ever closer union among the peoples of Europe” and instead see the Dutch Government’s proposed principle of the “European level only when necessary, at national level whenever possible” put in place,’ he wrote. However, the minister gave members little indication of the Government’s specific aims. He merely promised to note ‘carefully’ their views on immigration, agriculture, and employment and welfare regulation.","Prime Minister asks the Foreign Office to start talks with EU countries .

Senior Tory MPs demanded that the government publish a damning report into the £50 billion High Speed Rail project yesterday after the Mail revealed ministers are trying to suppress it. Conservative Vice Chairman Michael Fabricant broke ranks and warned that failure to come clean about the project would fuel ‘growing mistrust about HS2’. He spoke out after it emerged that Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin and Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude have called on David Cameron to veto the release of the report, which found that HS2 was a ‘red/amber’ project in danger of failing, under Freedom of Information laws. Michael Fabricant (pictured centre) warned that failure to come clean about the project would fuel 'growing mistrust about HS2 among the public' (file photo) Documents leaked to the Mail show that they plan to take the extraordinary step of using a veto usually deployed in cases of national security - because they fear the ‘political and presentational difficulties at a crucial point in the HS2 project’s development’. Mr Maude and Mr McLoughlin told the Prime Minister: ‘We consider that the importance the Government attaches to the successful implementation of the HS2 project ... justifies the use of the veto in this case.’ Mr Fabricant, who left the Tory whips office at the last reshuffle so he could campaign against HS2, told the Mail the report, drawn up in November 2011, should be released in full. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (pictured) and Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude called on the Prime Minister to veto the release of the Project Assessment Review . ‘I understand that the study is a little out of date but in my view it is foolish to withhold it,’ he said. ‘It only fuels the growing mistrust of HS2 among the public. ‘I would strongly argue that the report should be released, with a health warning that it is not up to date. More recent reports should also be released whether they show a green, an amber or a red light. ‘HS2 legislation has got to the stage in the timetable where it is unstoppable. It is like the proverbial runaway train which, if it is not careful, will derail with everyone careering off the track with it.’ Steve Baker, the MP for Wycombe, said: ‘I’m very concerned about this. I’ve been opposed to HS2 since I came into Parliament. I’ve always thought the business case was weak and I certainly think the fullest possible information should be made public. ‘This project will change the landscape of our country, both the topographically and economically and socially. An decision should be made with the fullest possible information. ‘Ministers claim it will usher in a new great age of the railways but it bares no comparison with the Victorian era since that involved private investors risking their own money and this is the Government risking taxpayers’ money.’ UKIP . Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall described the episode as an example of ‘shoddy politics’. ‘The Project Assessment Review should be published, and it should be published now,’ he said. ‘The fact that we have Cabinet Ministers seeking to block this report on HS2 demonstrates the cloak and danger approach the government is taking to this whole project and transparency in general. ‘Rather than being open, frank and honest about the many potential difficulties that HS2 is going to face, the government are seeking to bury that bad news. It is shoddy politics.’ Senior government sources Cabinet Secretary Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information pointed out that the veto has only previously been used to veto publication of Cabinet discussions on the Iraq War and other matters, to prevent disclosure of Prince Charles’s letters to ministers and a Department of Health risk register on NHS reforms. He said: ‘This case is interesting because the leaked letter talks not just about the principles of good government, it talks about the veto in terms of political presentation.’ He warned that excessive use of the veto would undermine the rule of law. ‘Vetoing means that ministers don’t have to argue their case at a tribunal or in court. It completely overturns the normal relationship between politicians and the law. I’m sure ministers would like to ignore the law and the courts in all sorts of cases but here they actually can.’ Sir Jeremy Heywood wants publication blocked because it would ‘create a precedent’ that would mean further Project Assessment Reviews would have to be released as well. HS2, whose £50 billion cost includes £7.5 billion for the high-speed trains, has a first phase which runs from London through Tory heartlands in the Chilterns to Birmingham which is due for completion in 2026. Richard Houghton, of the HS2 Action Alliance, said: If HS2 is going to deliver the vast economic benefits that are claimed for it, there would be no need for ministers to hide behind Parliamentary process, they would happily share documents like this.’ A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on leaked documents.’","Michael Fabricant demanded that the government publish report on HS2 .

A masterpiece painting by Marc Chagall which was found in the flat of a reclusive hoarder was stolen by the Nazis from a Jewish family when they were forced to flee to the U.S., it was reported today. The precise origins of many of the 1,400 artworks discovered at the home of Cornelius Gurlitt, son of a Nazi-era art dealer, have so far remained unclear, prompting a massive official investigation. But a German newspaper used official documents to link a previously unknown work by Chagall to Savely Blumstein, a German-Jewish man who lived in Latvia. Looted: This painting by Marc Chagall was stolen from the Blumstein family, German Jews who lived in Latvia . 'Our father often spoke about the Chagall and other artworks that were stolen by the Nazis,' Mr Blumstein's sons Neil and Philip told Bild. Experts value the work by the Russian-French early modernist painter, who died in 1985, at up to €1million (£840,000). The 'Allegorical Scene' from the mid-1920s was one of the works suspected to have been looted by the Nazis found in 2012 in Mr Gurlitt's Munich apartment. Hildebrand Gurlitt, father of the elderly recluse, was an art dealer who acquired an extraordinary haul of masterpieces throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Collection: Five of the 1,400 artworks found at the home of Cornelius Gurlitt, son of a Nazi-linked art dealer . The Nazi regime apparently commissioned him to sell art which was deemed 'degenerate', or which had been either stolen or bought under duress from Jewish collectors. The Chagall work was of 'particularly high art-historical value', said the art expert aiding the police investigation, Meike Hoffmann, when the haul was revealed last month. Bild reported that the Gestapo stole all the Blumsteins' property in 1941, after Savely had fled to the U.S. with his brother Salomon. Home: This unassuming block of flats in Munich hosted a staggering trove of masterpiece paintings . In 1957 they filed a compensation claim for all their family's stolen art, eventually receiving 25,000 deutschmarks (around £10,500) in 1981. Savely Blumstein died in 2009, but Bild tracked down his sons Neil, 57, and Philip, 53, after finding the compensation papers in state archives in Berlin. Hildebrand Gurlitt claimed he received the painting as a gift in 1943.","Painting by modern artist was found in the Munich flat of Cornelius Gurlitt .

Excluded: Children as young as five have been banned from class for 'sexual misconduct', including abuse, watching pornography and 'sexting' (file photo) Children as young as five have been excluded from schools for serious sexual abuse, watching pornography and 'sexting' inappropriate images of themselves. Hundreds of pupils have been banned from class for a raft of 'sexual misconduct', including assault, harassment and bullying. Others have been excluded for inappropriate touching, lewd behaviour and sexual graffiti. Shockingly, some children were disciplined within their first year at primary school when new learners are just four or five-years-old, although 13, 14 and 15 years old are the most likely to be punished. A new investigation found there were more than 2,000 reported incidents between January 2010 and September 2013, although the true figure is likely to be much higher, as nearly two-thirds of the 153 authorities contacted said they did not hold the information centrally, or refused to disclose it. Child welfare charities and politicians described the figures, uncovered by the Press Association, as 'extremely concerning' and called on the Government to clamp down on the ease with which children can access internet pornography, and to implement a 'robust' sex education programme. Jon Brown, head of tackling child sexual abuse at the NSPCC, said: 'The extent of sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behaviour and in the worst cases violence by children is extremely concerning. 'Exposure to extreme, sometimes sexually violent and degrading material is now only a few clicks away and this can warp young people’s views of what is normal and acceptable sexual behaviour. 'Sexting (sending sexual text messages) is now the norm for many young people who may find once they start sending explicit pictures of themselves the situation spirals out of control. 'We need good quality, age appropriate education in schools to help young people develop healthy, positive relationships with each other, so that children understand consent, do not feel so pressurised to behave in a sexualised way, and respect themselves and others.' Six children in reception classes across England were involved in a sexual act in a school, the figures showed. Exposed: Six children in reception classes, where pupils are just four or five, were involved in a sexual act in a school (file photo) There were a further 15 incidents involving six and seven-year-olds, rising to 69 incidents for children in Year 6, when pupils turn 11, at the time of the sexual misconduct. There was a surge in incidents as children reached secondary school - with 175 incidents in Year 7. The figures show further increases in the next three year groups - with 248 incidents for 13-year-olds, 256 for those a year older, and 240 for those in Year 10, when most pupils turn 15. Former children’s television presenter and Lib Dem peer, Baroness Benjamin, said she was not surprised by the data, having heard anecdotal evidence and received reports from charities of incidents involving very young children. Respect: Former PlaySchool presenter and Lib Dem peer Floella Benjamin said too many children are being exposed to pornographic material, and should learn to that sex is about 'mutual respect' She said: 'I believe one of the main contributory factors is children being exposed to pornographic online material which is easily available on the internet, and they are emulating what they see. They want to discover what it feels like to experience the sexual act they have seen and if they don’t achieve the level of satisfaction they expect they move on to the next girl. 'We need to have a robust sex and relationship education programme rolled out across all schools in the country for children and young people, which is age appropriate, to help them understand the true meaning of love, respect and unconditional sexual relationships.' The former Play School presenter said young boys are 'becoming addicted to pornography' and that teachers needed training to detect changes in children’s behaviour patterns which might hint at their involvement in abuse. She added: 'We have to teach them that sex is about mutual respect.' The large majority of incidents concerned boys, with only nine per cent involving girls. However, there were some gender spikes in the data. A spokesman for the London Borough of Hillingdon said: 'The most concerning issues involve so-called ""sexting"" with children communicating inappropriately with each other through mobile technology. 'There are also occasional reports of under age sexual intercourse, which do not reach the threshold for a criminal investigation, though the police are informed about such incidents. Also sexualised behaviour, such as masturbation is a common theme. 'In terms of the overall picture including informal consultations as well as formal referrals, the majority are females (55per cent).' Revealing: Data shows the number of children excluded from schools for sexual misconduct . Many authorities said incidents of sexual misconduct appeared to be decreasing. A spokesman for Derbyshire County Council, which was among those to see a year-on-year decrease in reported incidents, said: 'We support schools with their work to prevent incidents, and to learn from any that happen so they can safeguard against them. 'Our on-going work to reduce the number of fixed-term exclusions includes measures to prevent and deal effectively with any problems of this nature. 'We also run our anti-bullying ‘Stop!’ campaign with schools, and restorative justice programmes so students understand the consequences of their actions.' Worry: One education authority said the most concerning issue was 'sexting' with children communicating inappropriately with each other . A Department for Education spokesman said: 'We share headteachers’ serious concerns over sexual misconduct by pupils. That is why we have given teachers the power to search for and delete inappropriate images from phones, while the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Agency and the Sex Education Forum have produced useful material to help schools deal with ‘sexting’. 'Schools should teach pupils about respect for others and how the law applies to sexual relationships. And our statutory guidance is crystal clear - if a professional thinks a child is at risk of harm they should report it immediately to social care. 'It is encouraging that official statistics show exclusions for sexual misconduct are decreasing year on year and represent less than 0.05 per cent of exclusions across the country.' The figures come after a damning report last month by the Office of the Children’s Commissioner for England, which warned that youngsters across the country are being exploited and that the authorities responsible for their safety are failing to protect them. The two-year inquiry found that 2,409 youngsters were known to be victims of child sexual exploitation by gangs and groups, while a further 16,500 were at risk. Children aged between five and 16 were referred to Cambridgeshire¿s Sexual Behaviour Service for a range of incidents, including sending indecent images of themselves (file photo) Although education authorities were careful not to disclose any details of sexual misconduct due to the risk of identifying potential victims, some examples of the nature of some behaviour within England’s classrooms has emerged. The vague term 'sexual misconduct' is used to describe incidents from graffiti in the school toilets to serious offending, such as sexual abuse and using pornography in school. The figures show children as young as Reception class - typically aged four and five - have been reprimanded between January 2010 and September 2013, while the number of boys involved in sexual misconduct outnumbers girls by a rate of around 10-1. In the Merseyside borough of Knowsley, a five-year-old boy was excluded for using sexually explicit language, while another five-year-old was given a similar punishment for 'inappropriate touching'. Children aged between five and 16 were referred to Cambridgeshire’s Sexual Behaviour Service for a range of incidents, including sending indecent images of themselves, watching pornography and for 'inappropriate sexual thoughts'. There were 61 incidents, with parents of children involved being invited to meetings and advice sessions. Brent Council reported 159 incidents, including three boys, aged between eight and nine, permanently excluded in 2011 for sexual misconduct. The same authority also disclosed one 12-year-old boy was excluded for 30 days for his sexual offending. The London Borough of Merton Council reported four permanent exclusions in 2010 - three of which were for 14-year-old girls. Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council disclosed that an eight-year-old boy was permanently excluded in 2011 for 'behaving in a threatening and intimidating manner towards other students, including offensive sexual comments and requests of girls and the inappropriate touching of one of a group of girls'. The Isle of Wight, which has around 16,035 pupils on school rolls, recorded 15 incidents of pupils being excluded for sexual misconduct during the time frame, including three for offending against staff. Staff were also at the receiving end of sexual comments from a Year 7 pupil in Leicester, who was suspended for one day. A school in Durham permanently excluded a 15-year-old boy for indecent exposure, while a 13-year-old boy was given the same punishment for “inappropriate sexual gestures”, the local authority said. While some of the larger councils reported incidents exceeding three figures during the time frame, many stated these numbers were decreasing year on year. Others also disclosed a handful of incidents where staff were investigated - and in some cases sacked or prosecuted - for 'sexual misconduct' involving pupils. In Lincolnshire, this included a substantiated allegation that an inappropriate image of a three-year-old girl was taken by a member of staff.","Hundreds of pupils banned from schools for 'sexual misconduct'

Allan Dale described in court how he saw his wife cowering under their duvet as she tried to shield herself from their grandson's frenzied knife attack . A grandfather has described how his grandson looked like Norman Bates in Psycho when he came at him and his wife with a knife in their bedroom. Allan Dale, 80, whose wife Irene, 78, was killed in the frenzied attack, said that his wife cowered under their duvet during the brief attack at their house in Hull. Their grandson, Lewis Dale, 17, is on trial for murder and attempted murder. Speaking from behind a screen at Hull Crown Court he said: 'It was like that Psycho film - Norman Bates. 'He just came round. It was just like that Norman Bates with the knife. It was all over in seconds.' The pensioner then demonstrated to the judge and jury how his grandson stabbed him in the chest and then again in the abdomen. He said: 'It was a kitchen knife, shaped like a wedge - the strongest knife in the block.' Mr Dale said his wife woke up and was scared. He said she said to her grandson: 'What are you doing, Lewis?' Mr Dale said: 'I got up. How I managed to get up I don't know. I must have gone for him. That's when he stabbed me in the side.' He explained to the jury how his grandson left without saying a word and threw the knife at him. He said the weapon missed, sticking in the bedroom floor. Mr Dale described how his wife pulled the duvet over her head as the defendant attacked her and was left with her head resting on a bedside table. He said it was only a few minutes before his grandson left the house and got into the taxi. Mr Dale said: 'He sort of waved at me as if he was going on holiday. He told the jury he had been married to Irene for 57 years and that they had raised their children in the house after moving there in 1972. Hull Crown Court was told there was no . dispute that Lewis Dale (left), 17, killed Irene Dale (right), 78, and seriously . injured her husband Allan, 80, with a kitchen knife as they lay asleep . Andrew Robertson QC, defending, asked him about his relationship with Dale, which he said was 'very good'. He agreed that he and his wife 'both thought the world of him' and that Dale adored them too, . He said his wife played a big part in bringing up his grandson adding: 'I can remember him now in his play pen.' Mr Dale said his grandson was a regular and keen visitor but came to live with them about 10 days before the tragedy. He agreed this was due to some 'trouble with the police' at his father's home. Dale . sat in the dock wiping away tears as his grandfather described his . family life and the close relationship he and his wife had with him. Mr Dale agreed there was no explanation for what happened in the early hours of April 27. He . said that only hours before the attack he had spoken his grandson as he . was lying on his bed in his boxer shorts and telling him: 'I'm tired . grandad'. Mr Dale agreed . that in his police statement he had used the work 'psychotic' when . described the stabbing incident, adding that it was 'as if he was mad'. 'I know it was Lewis but I can't understand it, why it happened,' the pensioner said. Adrian Strong, prosecuting, described how Dale attacked his grandparents as they were in bed at their home in Hull, in April . Earlier . today, prosecutor Adrian Strong described how Dale attacked his . grandparents as they were in bed at their home in Hull, in April. Mr Strong said Dale was a user of the drug mephedrone which he said was also known as 'meow meow or M-Cat'. He . said: 'I anticipate that Lewis Dale will tell you that at the time of . the attack on his grandparents he was suffering a psychotic episode as a . result of his drug use.' Mr Strong said mephedrone used to be called a 'legal high' but was outlawed in 2010 and is now a class B controlled drug. He said users claim it provokes euphoria and heightened energy. But he said there were also reports it caused restlessness, anxiety, confusion and psychosis. Mr Strong said Mr and Mrs Dale had gone to bed at about 10.30pm on Friday April 26. They had been married for 50 years and had lived in the house where Mrs Dale died for 40 years, the jury was told. Dale, who denies murder and attempted murder, was living with his grandparents at the time of the attack. Dale, who denies murder and attempted murder, was living with his grandparents at the time of the attack.

Allan Dale had got up to use the bathroom at around 2am and had got back . into his bed next to his wife. The defendant was wearing a bathrobe with the hood pulled up, the prosecutor said. The . prosecutor said: 'Before he (Allan Dale) could say or do anything, . Lewis lunged at him and plunged a large kitchen knife into his chest. At least one person a week dies after taking mephedrone, which until two years ago was legal. Yet . despite the dangers the drug, Known as 'plant food' or 'mew meow', has . been hugely popular because of its cheapness and easy availability. It is now a class B drug. In 2010 clubbing magazine Mixmag christened mephedrone 'the UK's favourite new drug'. Used as a replacement for ecstasy or cocaine, it is sold on hundreds of internet sites for around £10 a gram. And unlike cocaine, it is unlikely to be cut with baking soda, paracetamol or more dangerous substances. Buying . it online with your credit card is straightforward and avoids any . contact with drug dealers or the danger of a run-in with the law. A . survey for the magazine found four out of ten of those surveyed had . tried it and a third had taken it within the previous month. One in six . said they took it every week. It is most often snorted in powder form but can also be obtained in pills and capsules. Side-effects . include headaches, palpitations, nausea, high blood pressure, a burning . throat, nose bleeds and purple joints, especially the knees and hands. 'It . is the choice of weapon and the force used against Allan Dale that, the . prosecution say, mean we can be sure this was attempted murder and that . Lewis Dale intended to kill Allan.' He said the defendant repeatedly stabbed his grandfather in the upper body. Mr Strong said Irene Dale then woke up and shouted at her grandson: 'Lewis, what are you doing?' 'Lewis . Dale broke off the attack on his grandfather, went round the other side . of the bed and repeatedly stabbed Irene as she lay in the bed, under . the duvet,' he said. 'Having stabbed Irene repeatedly through the duvet, he threw the knife at his grandfather and ran downstairs.' The jury was told one of the knife wounds suffered by Irene went through her heart and into her lung.She died at the scene. Mr Strong described how Allan Dale barricaded the room after the defendant left. He said the pensioner struggled to call 999 because the phone line had been cut but did manage to summon police and paramedics. Allan Dale said he heard his grandson shouting 'give me some money and I'll go' from downstairs. The jury was told that Dale left in a taxi ordered by his drug dealer, taking a TV from the house with him. He was arrested in Hull city centre later that night by armed police. Mr Strong said that he was taken to a police station and was mainly concerned with the whereabouts of a suitcase he had been carrying. He also questioned officers about why he was arrested on suspicion of robbery as well as the murder and attempted murder. But he told a doctor at the police station he was there 'because I've killed my gran', adding: 'I did it.' The prosecutor said there was telephone evidence of contact between Dale and his drug dealer after the attack and he said the defendant took the TV from the house to exchange for M-Cat. He also took the drug between the attack and his arrest, about an hour and 40 minutes later. A blood test found mephedrone and cocaine in his body, the jury heard. Mr Strong said: 'This wasn't psychosis. It was drug related. It was all bound up with Lewis Dale's wish and desire to obtain more drugs for himself - selfishness.' Dale appeared to be crying at one point during the description of the attack on his grandparents. He sat in the dock wearing a dark suit and a black, open-necked shirt, flanked by a single security guard, and sporting short, red hair. The case continues.

Middle-earth is the fictional setting of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Tolkien's map of Middle-earth shows only a small part of the world; most of the lands of Rhûn and Harad are not shown on the map, and there are also other continents. Middle-earth is meant to be located on our earth in an imaginary period in our planet's past. The Shire is meant to be northwestern Europe and Hobbiton was set at the same latitude of Oxford. In the Second and Third Ages, during which Tolkien set the events of the The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings, the Western regions of Middle-earth contained the lands of Eriador, Gondor, the Misty Mountains, and the vales of the great river Anduin. The term Middle-earth - also commonly referred to as middle world - was not invented by Tolkien. It occurs in Early Modern English as a development of the Middle English word middel-erde. Tolkien first encountered the term middangeard in an Old English fragment he studied in 1914: 'Hail Earendel, brightest of angels / above the middle-earth sent unto men', which is from the second of the fragmentary remnants of the Crist poems by Cynewulf.","The interactive map allows people to dodge trolls in Trollshaws and water plants in Rivendell in mini games .

Nick Clegg’s flagship plan to extend free school meals to all five, six and seven-year-olds is today condemned as impractical and unfair. Many primary school heads are warning they do not have the space or kitchen facilities to contend with the change for an extra 1.5 million children, which is due to take effect next September. Some heads and governors still believe that it will be impractical for many schools to provide a hot meal by September 2014, and they may have to offer a packed lunch instead. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's plan to extend the free school meals programme to all five, six and seven-year-olds, regardless of how much their parents earn, has come under fire from primary school headteachers who say it is 'impractical and unfair' A former Liberal Democrat minister, meanwhile, said it was ‘very odd’ to be extending free school meals for all families with young children, even those who could well afford to pay for them themselves. Despite Britain’s vast budget deficit, Mr Clegg has announced that from next September, an extra 1.5 million infants in reception and years one and two will qualify regardless of their parents’ income. The measure will save even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child. The £600 million a year cost of the scheme is to be met through spending cuts elsewhere and moves to clamp down on tax avoidance. However, critics have questioned the coherence of offering free school meals for all families with young children, while taking the axe to other universal payments such as child benefit for the better-off. Currently, free school meals are limited to the 400,000 poorest families, and many of those who are entitled do not claim because of the stigma attached to doing so. Extending them to all under-sevens in state education is designed to show the coalition is taking further steps to help families with the cost of living. The £600million plan is part of a deal with the Tories that meant them agreeing to a similar sum being spent on a £200 tax break for married couples. Last week, the Government rushed out an announcement of an extra £150 million to fund new kitchens and dining halls, but many schools still warn of logistical difficulties in getting the policy in place for September 2014. Sean O’Sullivan, head at Frank Wise special school in Banbury, Oxfordshire, who invested in a new server 18 months ago, said: ‘We have built a special kitchen that’s got warming and refrigeration but not actually the facility to cook. ‘I’m fearful this could push things to the lowest common denominator. Our suppliers simply can’t manage the quality that they do at the moment for high numbers.’ ‘These kind of things get announced at a political conference and, as a head, you’re absolutely bombarded. With the amount of stuff that comes through to you, you have to prioritise.’ Despite Britain's budget deficit, Mr Clegg has announced that from next September, an extra 1.5million infants will qualify for the scheme. The measure will save even the best-off families an average of £437 a year per child . Michael Dix, headteacher at Glebelands primary school in Leicester, said: ‘The school was built in the 1990s at a time when space cost money, so we don’t have any. 'The hall is not only used for dinner times - it is our only internal PE space. 'We will probably have to stagger our lunchtimes to allow for the additional serving-up time that will be inevitable if numbers rise. This would mean a reduction in the amount of PE we are able to provide.’ Former Lib Dem minister Sir Nick Harvey said last night: ‘This is not something that can be done on the back of a fag packet. In rural areas a lot of small primary schools don’t have big halls where you can sit the whole school down. ‘And tragically in recent years many schools have got rid of kitchens and devoted the space to other uses altogether. Former Lib Dem minister Sir Nick Harvey brands the decision to extend free meals to children whose parents can afford it themselves 'very odd' ‘There are 1.2 million children defined by the Government itself as living in childhood poverty who don’t get a free school meal. 200,000 of those will get one as a result of this, but the other million will not, because they are older. ‘It’s very odd to be providing a free school meal to 1.3 million children whose parents can perfectly well afford it and not paying out to one million whose parents can’t. It seems to me an odd sense of priorities.’ The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) warned many schools ‘absolutely can’t think how they are going to do this’. The organisation predicted that the Government would have to U-turn on an initial commitment to providing a ‘hot, nutritious meal’ for all children. The commitment has already been refined to a pledge to ‘ensure children get a healthy meal in the middle of the day’. Headteachers and governors still believe that it will be impractical for many schools to provide a hot meal by September 2014, and they may have to offer a packed lunch instead. ‘We have pointed out the key challenges for schools, particularly if they’re going to insist on a hot school meal. There is lots more flexibility if it’s a packed lunch to the nutritional standards,’ said Valentine Mulholland, of the NAHT. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We know that regularly eating a nutritious school meal can help to increase a child’s educational attainment. ‘Free school meals for all infant school pupils will save parents an average of £400 a year, and make sure every child can get the healthy lunch that will help them do well at school.’ A spokesman for Mr Clegg insisted: ‘The expectation is for the majority of meals to be hot.’","Primary school heads warning they do not have the space or kitchen facilities to contend with the change for an extra 1.5million children .

An Uzbekistan national living in Boise said little during his first court appearance on Friday on federal charges from Idaho that he gave support, cash and other resources to help a recognized terrorist group in his home country plan a terrorist attack there. Fazliddin Kurbanov, 30, was arrested yesterday during a raid of his small apartment. Prosecutors have offered few details of their investigation or Kurbanov's role in helping a militant group back home. He was charged in Idaho and Utah after an extensive investigation into his activities late last year and this year. Scroll down for video... Base: Federal authorities search an apartment in Boise, Idaho. U.S. authorities in Idaho said they have arrested a man from Uzbekistan accused of plotting to build a bomb . Kurbanov pleaded not guilty during the hearing that lasted about 20 minutes. Kurbanov - with a short, cropped beard, dark hair and wearing a jail jumpsuit - spoke only a few words to the judge, their communication complicated by language differences. Federal officials said they will enlist the help of an interpreter when Kurbanov, who lists Uzbek as his first language and Russian as his second in court documents, appears Tuesday for his detention hearing. Until then, he will be held in the Ada County Jail. Kurbanov said he couldn't pay for an attorney, so federal public defender Richard Rubin was appointed to handle the case. 'Given his arrest, we believe any potential threat he posed has been contained,' said U.S Attorney Wendy Olson, who declined to comment on whether federal agents are pursuing additional arrests. Their investigation is ongoing, she said. Accused: Fazliddin Kurbanov, 30, was arrested at an apartment complex in south Boise yesterday . Brought to account: U.S. Attorney David B. Barlow, of Utah, speaks during an interview at his office . Kurbanov has been living in the United States legally, but his immigration status is unclear. He said he had a job driving trucks in Boise and listed his only assets as a couple of used cars and a small amount of cash in checking and savings accounts. His trial on the three counts filed in Idaho is scheduled for July 2. Olson said she has seen Internet comments blaming Idaho's Muslim community, something she called inappropriate. She said her office enjoys ""outstanding partnerships"" with its members. 'These charges shouldn't be seen as a reflection on that community,' Olson said. The Idaho indictment charges Kurbanov with one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and possession of an unregistered explosive device. It alleges that between August and May, Kurbanov knowingly conspired with others to provide support and resources, including computer software and money, to the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which the U.S. has identified as a terrorist organization. Grand jury: Fazliddin Kurbanov, 30, was arrested at an apartment complex in south Boise on Thursday morning after a grand jury issued a three-count indictment as part of an investigation into his activities in Idaho and Utah . The group's purpose is to overthrow the government of Uzbekistan, said David B. Barlow, U.S. attorney in Utah. The alleged co-conspirators were not named. The indictment also alleges Kurbanov provided material support to terrorists, knowing that the help was to be used in preparation for a plot involving the use of a weapon of mass destruction. On Nov. 15, Kurbanov possessed an explosive device, consisting of a series of parts intended to be converted into a bomb, according to the indictment. Those parts included a hollow hand grenade, a hobby fuse, aluminum powder, potassium nitrate and sulfur. A separate federal grand jury in Utah charged Kurbanov with distributing information about explosives, bombs and weapons of mass destruction. For 10 days in January, Kurbanov taught and demonstrated how to make an 'explosive, destructive device, and weapon of mass destruction,' the document states. Multiple charges: A separate federal grand jury in Utah also returned an indictment charging Kurbanov with distributing information about explosives, bombs and weapons of mass destruction . The Utah indictment, which will be handled separately after the Idaho prosecution is resolved, alleges that Kurbanov provided written recipes for how to make improvised explosive devices and went on instructional shopping trips in Utah showing what items are necessary to buy to make the devices, Barlow said. Kurbanov also showed Internet videos on the topic, Barlow said. The prosecutor declined to say whom Kurbanov took on the shopping trips in Utah but said that information will come out as the case proceeds. The indictment from Utah also alleges that Kurbanov intended that the videos, recipes, instructions and shopping trips be used to make an explosive device for the 'bombings of a place of public use, public transportation system, and infrastructure facility.' The arrest shows that 'there is no priority that is more important than the protection of the public and the prevention and disruption of alleged terrorist activities - wherever they might occur,' Barlow said. Wendy Olson, the U.S. attorney in Idaho, said Kurbanov is the only person charged, and any potential threat was contained by his arrest. 'He was closely monitored during the course of the investigation,' she said. 'The investigation has been underway for some time.' Olson declined to share any specifics of Kurbanov's alleged activities, including whether any potential terrorist threat or targets were domestic or abroad. It was unclear when he moved to Idaho. An Idaho telephone number registered to Kurbanov has been disconnected. Although the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan started in the 1990s with the stated aim of overthrowing the Uzbek regime and establishing an Islamic government, its goals have expanded to create a broader Islamic influence in Central Asia. The movement's fighters have a presence in Afghanistan's northern provinces and in Pakistan's Waziristan province. U.S. and Afghan officials say al-Qaeda has been building ties with the IMU. Last year, an Uzbek named Ulugbek Kodirov was sentenced to a minimum 15 years in prison in Alabama for plotting to shoot President Barack Obama while on the campaign trial. Kodirov pleaded guilty, saying he was acting at the behest of the IMU . According to Idaho's court system, Kurbanov has no criminal convictions but was ticketed for speeding violations twice in 2012 - once in October, when he paid a $90 fine, and another instance in May when he paid $85.","The indictment includes one count of conspiracy to aid a terrorist organization .

Happy couple: Louisa Hodkin and fiance Alessandro Calcioli say they are 'ecstatic' after Supreme Court judges ruled they can get married in a Church of Scientology chapel . A couple say they are 'ecstatic' after judges in the UK's highest court ruled they can get married in a Church of Scientology chapel. Bride-to-be Louisa Hodkin had appealed to the Supreme Court after a High Court judge ruled that services run by Scientologists were not 'acts of worship'. The Supreme Court judges overturned the ban, meaning overjoyed Miss Hodkin and her fiance Alessandro Calcioli can start planning their dream wedding at the chapel in central London. Miss Hodkin, 25, said: 'I am really . excited. I'm really glad we are finally being treated equally and can . now get married in our church.' She said they hoped to get married in the next few months but have yet to set a date. Five Supreme Court justices analysed the . case at a hearing in London in July and ruled in Miss Hodkin's favour . today, announcing that the Scientology church was a 'place of meeting . for religious worship'. She took legal action after the . registrar general of births, deaths and marriages refused to register . the London Church Chapel for the solemnisation of marriages under the . 1855 Places of Worship Registration Act - because it was not a place for . 'religious worship'. Supreme Court justices said religion should not be confined to faiths involving a 'supreme deity'. They . said the Church of Scientology held religious services, therefore its . church was a 'place of meeting for religious worship'. Mr Calcioli said: 'I think the court's definition of religion is . excellent. I think it's what most people today would understand . 'religion' to be. I'm ecstatic.' Lords Neuberger, Clarke , Wilson , Reed and Toulson unanimously allowed Miss Hodkin's appeal against the High Court ruling. In . 1970 the Church of Scientology launched a similar case when the Court . of Appeal ruled that Scientology did not involve religious worship . because there was no 'veneration of God or of a Supreme Being'. Miss . Hodkins and Mr Calcioli, both volunteers at the church near the . Embankment in central London, had appealed the decision to block the . wedding in July 2011 as they saw it as unlawful religious . discrimination. Scroll down for video . Refusal: The registrar general of births, deaths and marriages had refused to register the London Church Chapel for the solemnisation of marriages under the 1855 Places of Worship Registration Act - because it was not a place for 'religious worship' Congregation: The chapel where Miss Hodkin and Mr Calcioli will make their vows in front of friends and family . She was backed by the Church of Scientology which has previously been . unsuccessful in getting certification for other premises in England they . say are for 'religious worship.' At the hearing Lord Lester of Herne Hill QC, appearing for Miss Hodkin . and the Church of Scientology Religious Education College, said she and . her fiance wanted to celebrate their marriage through a legally . recognised Scientology wedding in London, surrounded by their families . and fellow church volunteers. Lord Lester said there had been a failure to have proper regard to . evidence that the form of worship observed by Scientologists had . continued to evolve and now was materially different from what it had . been previously. But last year the judge said he was bound by previous legal rulings and . even the Human Rights Act did not provide a basis to rule differently. Challenge: Miss Hodkin and Mr Calcioli, both volunteers at the church near the Embankment in central London, had appealed the decision to block the wedding in July 2011 as they saw it as unlawful religious discrimination . Miss Hodkin lost her High Court fight . in December 2012 when Mr Justice Ouseley said he was bound by the 1970 . Court of Appeal decision and therefore had to dismiss her challenge. But he said Supreme Court judges should consider the question of whether Scientologists worshipped. He . said that because the Supreme Court was a more senior court than the . Court of Appeal, Supreme Court judges might take a different view. Bride-to-be: Scientologist Louisa Hodkin said she was 'really excited' to be getting married after the Supreme Court ruled in her favour . Miss . Hodkin argued that the 1970 ruling should not be binding because . Scientologist beliefs and services had evolved during the past four . decades. She said services were 'ones of religious worship' and likened Scientology to Buddhism and Jainism. Miss Hodkin said: 'My fiance and I have always believed in the fairness of the British legal process. 'It's been a long and demanding journey, but the Supreme Court's decision today has made it all worthwhile. 'We are really excited that we can now get married, and thank our family and friends for all of their patience and support.' Her solicitor Paul Hewitt, a partner . at law firm Withers, said: 'The Supreme Court's judgment is a victory . for the equal treatment of religions in the modern world. 'We . are delighted at the outcome - it always felt wrong that Louisa was . denied the simple right, afforded to members of other religions, to . enjoy a legal marriage ceremony in her own Church.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles had welcomed Mr Justice Ouseley's ruling. Mr . Pickles said the Church of Scientology might have been entitled to 'tax . breaks' - because of rules governing places of public worship - had a . decision gone in its favour. He said taxpayers would not want 'such a controversial organisation' to get 'special' treatment. Local government minister Brandon Lewis said his department would be taking legal advice following the ruling. He said: 'I am very concerned about this ruling, and its implications for business rates. 'In the face of concerns raised by . Conservatives in Opposition, Labour ministers told Parliament during the . passage of the Equalities Bill that Scientology would continue to fall . outside the religious exemption for business rates. But we now discover . Scientology may be eligible for rate relief and that the taxpayer will . have to pick up the bill, all thanks to Harriet Harman and Labour's . flawed laws. 'Hard-pressed taxpayers will wonder . why Scientology premises should now be given tax cuts when local firms . have to pay their fair share. 'We . will review the Court's verdict and discuss this with our legal . advisers before deciding the next steps. However, it will remain the . case that premises which are not genuinely open to the public will not . qualify for tax relief.' Venue: The London Church Chapel, where Miss Hodkin and Mr Calcioli now plan to marry . Since 2005 a new law enabled couples in Britain to marry in premises approved by . local authorities, such as hotels and stately homes - rather than just a . church or registry office. Civil marriage venues have since been expanded to include pubs, football . grounds, wine distilleries, and other places far removed from a . traditional church setting. The . case was of particular importance to the Church of Scientology and its . followers as several similar cases have been turned down in court in the . past. Miss Hodkin argued . that the 1970 ruling should not be binding on any court because . Scientologist beliefs and services had evolved during the past 42 years. Celebrity: Famous Scientologists include actors Tom Cruise, left, and John Travolta, right . She said services were 'ones of religious worship' and likened Scientology to Buddhism and Jainism. Scientology . is a controversial religious belief system that teaches that people are . immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature. Famous Scientologists include actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Founder: Science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard founded the Church of Scientology . The Church of Scientology was founded in 1953 by American science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard. Hubbard wrote that 75 million years ago, an alien ruler called Xenu brought billions of his people to Earth in a spaceship before killing them in a bomb blast, leaving their spirits to wander around and harm the living. According to Hubbard, following Scientology means you can be clear of these malevolent spirits. Scientology describes itself as the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, others, and all of life. One purpose of Scientology, as stated by the Church, is to become certain of one's spiritual existence and one's relationship to God, or the 'Supreme Being.' Scientologists believe that in . addition to the five senses of hearing, sight, touch, taste and smell we . have 57 additional abilities known as 'perceptics'. These include an ability to sense . blood circulation, balance, compass direction, temperature, gravity as . well as an 'awareness of importance, unimportance.' In order to ascend up the Scientology ladder, followers must complete a number of courses and be 'Clear' in Dianetics. This is a state, according to Hubbard, when a human 'no longer has his own reactive mind and therefore suffers none of the ill-effects that the reactive mind can cause.' The Church believes that humans suffer unwanted and negative feelings, which lead to illnesses. If every person applies Dianetics in their life, they can be 'Clear', or free, of these feelings and therefore avoid sickness. The next stage is to achieve Operating Thetan levels, or OTs for short. There are eight levels before the truth of Scientology can be fully revealed. It is believed that actor Tom Cruise took five years to reach this level.","Scientologist Louisa Hodkin wants to marry Alessandro Calcioli .

The Colorado-based company found that the bill of materials (BOM) for the PS4 equates to $372, plus manufacturing costs taking it up $381. This is $18 less than the retail price. Although Microsoft saw similar queues ahead of its Xbox One launch last week, even the most die-hard fans didn't arrive until around 7am on the morning of the launch. The PS4 Lounge in Covent Garden opened two weeks ago to coincide with the console going on sale in the U.S. It was opened so fans could play PS4 games ahead of their official release Friday. Prices for the PS4 start at £349 - around £80 cheaper than the Xbox One, but some retailers have already sold out of pre-orders and others are warning they may not get new stock in time for Christmas. Asda announced today it has got extra stocks of the console and 155 stores will be selling the machines from midnight Thursday. The PS4's launch line-up features 22 games including military shooters, sports simulations and family-friendly adventures. It also offers media apps, including Hulu and Netflix, with the aim of enticing non-gamers to splash out on the console.

The slimline machine has a new user interface that lets gamers connect with other users and download games and films from the PlayStation Store. Sony says the console has ten times the processing power of the PS3 and offers a screen resolution of up to 1080p. It claims the console's faster frame rates will mean environments in games, TV shows and films will be more detailed, lighting will look more realistic and animations will be smoother.

The PS4 Lounge in Covent Garden has been open since the U.S. launch to allow die-hard fans to try out games ahead of the UK release and will be the focus of the UK launch . However, only time will tell if the PlayStation 4 will be as big a hit as Microsoft’s Xbox One. More than one million Xbox One consoles were sold throughout the world in the first 24 hours, according to Microsoft, which surpasses first-day sales of the Xbox 360 - the previous-generation model. The new console was launched in 13 countries at midnight on 22 November and the software giant said it sold out almost immediately at most retailers.

Microsoft statisticians estimated that in the first day of game play, fans killed more than 60 million zombies in Dead Rising 3 and drove more than 3.6 million miles on Forza Motorsport 5. Sony’s Playstation 4 was released in the U.S and Canada on Friday 15 and also sold 1million units in the first 24 hours . It was the first major console release for the Japanese company since 2006. Analytic firm IHS predicted earlier this year that Sony's PlayStation 4 would outsell Microsoft's Xbox One and be the most popular console among gamers buy the end of next year. However, John Lewis disagrees and predicted last week that Microsoft's console will outsell Sony's despite being more expensive. John Lewis gaming buyer Robert Hennessey said: 'With exclusive titles, a strong multimedia offering, plus a thoroughly re-worked Kinect motion control system, the Xbox One appears to be ahead of the game this Christmas.

Former Liverpool manager Graeme Souness has criticised Manuel Pellegrini making an astonishing Champions League gaffe. The Manchester City manager failed to realise that one more goal against Bayern Munich would have seen the English club finish top of Champions League Group D... and they had a full 28 minutes to try to score it! James Milner scored in the 62nd minute to put City 3-2 up at the Allianz Arena, leaving Pellegrini's side requiring a solitary goal to leapfrog the Germans at the top of the group thanks to a superior head-to-head record. A 4-2 result City would have seen them avoid the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid in the knockout stages. Leading goalscorer Sergio Aguero was left sitting on the bench as Pellegrini waited until the 88th minute to make his final substitution, replacing striker Edin Dzeko with midfielder Jack Rodwell. Souness, working as a pundit on Sky Sports, was clearly bemused. He said: ‘I’m not sure he’s understanding the goal difference here. It has to be the strangest substitution this season in taking off Dzeko, a centre forward, and putting on Rodwell, who at best is an attacking midfielder. VIDEO: Watch confused City boss fail to realise he needed only one more goal . Confusion: Pellegrini said he was tempted to bring Aguero on if City scored the fourth, but they only needed one . Mishap: Pellegrini brought off Edin Dzeko in the closing stages and brought on Jack Rodwell . SKY SPORTS: You're 3-2 up, you've got quite a bit of time to get this goal which would have topped the group, were you not tempted to put on (Sergio) Aguero, your best striker? PELLEGRINI: I was tempted if we scored the fourth goal of course, that's why I sent out Aguero to warm up but also I think that it was a risk to continue with (David) Silva, he can't play more than 70 minutes. 'I would suggest that they've not . spoken about it and he wasn't aware. Maybe the guys he's sitting with on . the bench, Brian Kidd and his other coach, had not spoken about it and . weren't aware that 4-2 gets them through. 'When . he says (in his post-match interview), 'if we'd got another goal, I'd . told Aguero to warm up', it tells you he's thinking he needs to get . five. It was one of the strangest substitutions I've seen in a long . time.' Pellegrini admitted that he would only . have put on Aguero if City had made it 4-2. Man City could have gone through with another goal, based on their head-to-head record against Bayern . Second place: Pellegrini said it 'was difficult to score two goals' with the score at 3-2, but City only one . Turnaround: James Milner wheels away after putting City 3-2 ahead in Munich having been 2-0 down . ‘Maybe if we had scored a . fourth goal I would have made the change,’ said the confused Chilean . coach. ‘It was important to be first in the group but not the most . important. ‘Arsenal on Sunday was a priority above this game. I said it was very difficult to win by three goals.’ James Milner, who scored the winning . goal with 28 minutes left, said: ‘We’re slightly disappointed we did . not finish top of the group. No holding back: Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness . 'We didn’t know if 4-2 would be enough or if . we would need 5-2. We thought it needed to be 5-2 to be honest.’ Sky Sports analysts Souness, . Glenn Hoddle and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher were all left baffled by Pellegrini’s decision. Hoddle added: ‘Does he understand that 4-2 puts him through (as group leaders). ‘There’s no urgency to make a substitution.’ Carragher said: ‘He must know he can’t . play any English team and the ones left — Barcelona, Real Madrid, maybe . Atletico Madrid — could be massive.’ Pep Guardiola said: 'I would like to . congratulate Man C for this great victory. It is never good to lose . again but maybe this club the manager and the team sometimes we need a . defeat because we always win everything, in the Bundesliga, in Europe. 'We . have started very well in the Bundesliga in the cup, we won in . Manchester. You always think everything is easy, but Europe is very . difficult so maybe it is good for us for Maracech next Saturday. Mishap: Pellegrini brought off Edin Dzeko in the closing stages and brought on Jack Rodwell . 'We played really well in the first 30 minutes. Then first ten mins in second half Manchester City were better than us. In general we are satisfied for Bayern. 'I hope we can see how difficult it is playing in Europe, sometimes things like this happen and we have to understand and learn our lessons from this. We have to understand how difficult it is to win all the time, so we are ready for the knockout stages. 'We have got to realise we can also lose. We are a great team, a super team but we can also lose, because the other teams are good. 'They started really well, they were really focussed. But if you are not in control of the game... the passes between our players were not good, we must use the ball better and do something with it. 'Manchester City are not a bad team, you cannot score against them with just 2-3 touches. 'They shot 4 times on our go, in the first 15 minutes of the second half they were better than us, just that little period, maybe we were level for the last 15 of the first half. The rest of the time we were better.' A similar incident resulted in Manchester City's relegation in the 1995-96 season, with Alan Ball in charge at Maine Road. Battling . against relegation and playing Liverpool on the final day of the . season, City conceded two own-goals before drawing level through Uwe . Rosler and Kit Symons.

A North Carolina social worker has been charged after her 11-year-old foster child was found chained to the porch of her home with a dead chicken hanging around his neck, a sheriff's official said on Saturday. Wanda Sue Larson, 57, was arrested and charged with child abuse and false imprisonment on Friday after a deputy found the boy shivering and handcuffed by his ankle to the front porch, the Union County, North Carolina sheriff's office said. Larson, a supervisor at the county's Child Protective Services office, was not home when the child was discovered but is accused of being complicit in the mistreatment, according to sheriff's officials. Abuse: Wanda Sue Larson, who works as a supervisor for Child Protective Services, was arrested after deputies found a child handcuffed to her porch with a chicken around his neck . Foster father: Dorian Harper was the parent at home when the child was found cuffed to the porch and was arrested on the spot . Authorities also arrested Dorian Lee Harper, 57, who along with Larson was serving as a foster parent to the child. The couple has four adopted children in addition to the foster child. A deputy was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property when he saw the child handcuffed to the porch. He approached the house and was confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for Harper's identification and an explanation as to why the child was handcuffed to the porch. According to WBTV, one of the children opened the front door, releasing several large dogs who attacked the deputy. By the time he had the dogs under control, Harper had removed the child from the porch and left the dead chicken on a barrel in front of the house. Other officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal investigation was opened. The children were removed from the home and are in the care of protective services outside of Union County. 'It's just shocking,' Captain Ronnie Whitaker said on Saturday. 'It's just disturbing that anyone would treat a child in such a manner.' Both Larson and Harper were charged with intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment, and cruelty to animals due to the condition of some of their pets. Disturbing: The child services worker lives at this property with four adopted children and one foster child . It is unclear what prompted the use of the dead chicken and handcuffs on the boy. Whitaker said he could not disclose details from police interviews conducted as part of the investigation. Larson and Harper remained jailed on Saturday. They each face charges of intentional child abuse that inflicted serious injury, false imprisonment and cruelty to animals, with the latter allegation based on the condition of some of the family pets, the sheriff's office said. Larson also is charged with willful failure to discharge her duty as a public official. The five children, ages 14, 13, 11, nine and eight, have been removed from the home and put in the care of a social services agency outside of Union County, the sheriff's office said.","A man and women were charged after a boy was found handcuffed to their front porch with a dead chicken around his neck .

Yvonne Musonda-Malata was found guilty of failing to provide appropriate clinical care to Baby A at a Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing . A midwife faces being struck off after she was found guilty of leaving a newborn baby in a hospital stationery cupboard. Yvonne Musonda-Malata, 35, left the four-day-old child’s cot in the unlit and unventilated cupboard – where the little one was found covered in vomit, on her stomach and suffocating. The midwife admitted removing the ‘unsettled’ girl so that her mother could get a night’s sleep, but denied putting her in the cupboard. Nursing regulators have ruled that she did so and are meeting today to decide whether Musonda-Malata’s extraordinary actions amount to misconduct – for which the sanctions include a ban from practising. The case, being heard at the Nursing and Midwifery Council in London, comes as NHS staff have been warned they may in future face criminal charges if they neglect patients. Musonda-Malata’s actions at the Queen’s Hospital in Romford, Essex,  were only discovered when nursery nurse Alex Curtis went to get an envelope – and was horrified to find the baby shut in with the stationery. The child is believed to have been there for around 20 minutes. Musonda-Malata, who was suspended but continues to work at Queen’s, initially admitted responsibility, but later changed her story and accused Miss Curtis of lying. Nursing and Midwifery Panel chairman Lesley White said yesterday: ‘The panel found Miss Curtis to be a credible and consistent witness. ‘She had no motive to be untruthful and the panel has no reason to believe she was mistaken.’ She said that Musonda-Malata’s decision to shut the baby in the cupboard ‘amounted to a failure to provide clinical care’. Another midwife was also charged over the incident, which took place in April 2011. Christine Onoade, 46, was cleared of involvement – but has since been sacked from the hospital. Christine Olukemi Onoade was cleared of all charges today. The midwife had been accused of failing to provide appropriate care for the baby, and claimed her life had taken a 'nosedive' in wake of the scandal . Musonda-Malata claimed she left the baby in Onoade’s care while she was away with another patient. But . the hearing heard that when she was asked, immediately after the baby . was discovered, what she had done, Musonda-Malata told ward sister . Martina Cheng: ‘I have made a mistake, I’m in big trouble’. The midwives were entrusted with the baby while its mother, who suffers a health condition, was resting at Queen's Hospital in Romford, north east London . Musonda-Malata . later claimed that her confession was inaccurate and only made because . she was not in ‘the right frame of mind’ and ‘just wanted to write . something in the notes and get out of the place’. Musonda-Malata’s . claims were rejected by the panel, which also found her guilty of . failing to provide appropriate clinical care in that she did not . accurately record the baby’s feeds while she was in her keeping. Onoade was cleared of the same charge after the panel ruled that had not been part of her duties. Speaking . after the decision, Onoade said she was relieved to be cleared but . described the case as a ‘nightmare’. Musonda-Malata was unavailable for . comment. The women faced a hearing at the Nursing and Midwifery Council in central London.

Tragedy: William Avery-Wright died on a road outside his school, but his father only learned his son was killed after his boarding school posted the news on its website . A father learned that his 13-year-old son had been killed in a road accident when the boy’s public school announced it on its website. William Avery-Wright had been knocked down by a Land Rover as he crossed a main road on his way to rugby practice. He was taken to hospital after the accident at £30,000-a-year Worth School in Crawley, West Sussex, where he was later pronounced dead. His father, Christopher, was contacted but was only told that his son had been injured. But as he was being driven by police to hospital, he was inundated with messages of condolence on his mobile phone from well-wishers who had read about the death on the school’s website. Staff had posted a hasty tribute to the youngster before the 48-year-old insurance broker had been informed that he had died. William’s mother, Lisa, was already at the hospital, but had been advised not to break the news of his death to her husband until he was there. She said: ‘I was taken to hospital by the police. They said not to tell Christopher what had happened on the phone and that it was an appalling way to break the news.’ But the Roman Catholic boarding school wasted no time in announcing the pupil’s death online, publishing a tribute and sending out an email to parents. Mrs Avery-Wright said: ‘The school made the decision to post the news on its website almost immediately – before William’s body had even been formally identified. ‘So many people read about it on Facebook and Christopher was flooded with messages, emails and texts. We have no idea why the school would have done that. My husband should not have found out on his way to the hospital.’ Distraught: Christopher Avery-Wright with William, who started receiving messages of condolence on his way to hospital to see his son . Message: How the website of Worth School in Sussex announced William's death . Mrs Avery-Wright, 43, told how shortly after the 2pm accident she had arrived at the crash scene. She said: ‘I saw the road cordoned off and I remember seeing William’s boots alone on the road and I knew immediately. I just broke down.’ William’s parents, from Crowborough, Sussex, are now suing the school for allegedly failing in its duty of care to their son. They say they have been ‘living a life sentence’ since his death in November 2011 – aggravated by the way Mr Avery-Wright learned of the tragedy. Popular: Keen cricketer William Avery-Wright died aged 13 and an inquest is yet to take place . They claim William and his class should have been supervised by an adult as they crossed the 60mph road which separates the school’s changing rooms and rugby pitches. Mrs Avery-Wright added: ‘I just do not know what they were thinking not escorting the children across the road. ‘You do not expect your child to go to school, but not come home. That is why we feel the school have to take some responsibility. We trusted them to look after William.’ The couple say the school only placed a warden on the crossing following the crash and the playing fields have since been used less often for lessons. Mrs Avery-Wright, who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after the ordeal, said: ‘For a few weeks after I just gave up and curled up on the sofa and cried. I was in total shock. I was traumatised at what had happened.’ William, a day boy at the school, was in the A team for school sports including football, cricket and rugby and was a rising star at Crowborough Beacon Golf Club. His parents say the school added to their agony by asking them to remove tributes from the roadside less than five weeks after his death. A spokesman for Worth School said: ‘What was published on the day of the accident was done in good faith and in the belief that William’s parents had been informed of his death. Sadly, it transpired the school’s understanding was incorrect. ‘On the date of the accident the school attempted at all times to act correctly and it deeply regrets if any of its actions contributed to the distress of Mr and Mrs Avery-Wright.’ Upset: William's mother Lisa Avery-Wright says the family are suing the school for failure in its duty of care to their son . Claims: Worth School in Sussex (pictured) says it feels 'every sympathy' with William's family . Worth is a Roman Catholic school which was founded by a Benedictine monk in 1959. It is located on a 500-acre estate in Sussex countryside. The independent day and boarding school caters for those aged 11 to 18. The maximum class size is 18 pupils.

'She wanted to make memory boxes for each of the girls too and got them started, but now it is up to us to fill them with more memories. 'She wrote letters to the girls too asking them not to be angry that she had died but to understand that she was in a better place now.

She . now helps her father style their hair in the morning and reminds him of . all the little things that Lucy used to do such as marking birthdays on . calendars and helping organise things for school. As well as tips on how to deal with . obstacles in life there were also strict instructions on her funeral . arrangements and what jewellery to give to each of the girls. Mark . said: 'When she knew her life was almost over, Lucy turned to me and . said ‘make sure the girls know that I fought to be with them for as long . as I could. 'My wife lived . for the girls. Every new treatment the doctors could find she would . try, just to have as long and full a life as she could have with them. 'That . was the sort of woman she was, selfless, caring and the sort of woman . who always put other people before herself, no matter how ill she was.' Lucy left husband Mark a guide featuring tips on how to deal with puberty and obstacles in the girls' lives as well as strict instructions on her funeral arrangements . Emily said: 'I miss my mum a lot but I know that dad and the other girls need me too. 'Dad . doesn’t know how to plait hair or do anything girly so we have to teach . him, if that means that he has to have his nails painted then that is . something he just has to face. 'I . need to make sure that he picks nice clothes for us all as mum always . wanted us to look our best, but as long as he takes us shopping with him . I’m sure he can pick some nice things.

'Christmas is going to be strange . without her because we had so many different things that she used to do . and not having her here is going to feel odd. 'I was angry at first that she had gone but now I understand that it was better for her to not be in pain.' Three weeks after Lucy gave birth to her twin daughters, she found a lump in her breast - and was diagnosed with cancer. Mark said: 'I remember being told it was cancer and I just broke down but Lucy stayed strong and just listened. 'We had three-week-old twins and two young daughters waiting for us at home.

She . said: 'She felt as if she was missing out on things like taking the . girls swimming and being able to do lots of things with them. 'She did it for the girls, that was what she was like, always thinking of what she could do for the girls.' For the next five years the couple attended regular check-ups hoping that Lucy was successful in her battle but after complaining of pains in her chest scans found she had bone cancer. Mark said: 'We were devastated that it had returned. We didn’t hide it from the girls but we were careful about what we said to them. 'Having to tell them ‘mummy has cancer again’ was heartbreaking. By then Emily was older and understood a bit more and simply asked ""can you die from cancer?’"" This broke our hearts as we just didn’t know what to tell her.' Husband Mark said: 'Life will never be the same without her but I have four incredible girls that I have to live for, I promised Lucy that I would do that for her.' In her final few days Lucy was taken to hospital and handed Mark the guide that outlined what he would need to do. While the book was not finished she also managed to write letters to her daughters asking them not to be angry or hurt that she had died.

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . PUBLISHED: . 16:01 EST, 4 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:40 EST, 5 May 2013 . In the unlikely event – as they say in safety briefings – that the entire flight crew of the new £250million double-decker Airbus A380 superjumbo were to be struck down by a dodgy prawn, then I’m your man. When that call goes up ‘Can anyone here fly this plane?’, I am fairly confident after spending a couple of hours in British Airways’ £10million scarily lifelike simulator at their London Heathrow Airport base that I might just have a  fighting chance of a decent stab at it. And believe me, this looks, feels and performs just like the real deal – so much so that if you’re not a good flier and prone to airsickness, you may even feel a bit queasy at some of the more energetic manoeuvres. Scroll down for video . Ray Massey (left) takes the helm of the superjumbo A380 simulator, guided by BA's Richard Frewer . For my ‘cabin doors to manual’ moment I was under the wise and watchful gaze of BA’s senior development engineer Richard Frewer who is putting the world’s favourite airline’s own pilots through their paces on this very machine before their first of 12 A380s is delivered in July. before entering service in October. BA’s inaugural flight and regular service will be the ‘red carpet’ Hollywood  route to Los Angeles – or ‘LAX’ to use the aviation jargon, which British screen star Gemma Arterton launched earlier this year. So what better place for my first try out. I have been in the cockpit of an A380 before – most notably for an hour or so with an Airbus test pilot team over  the Gobi desert on an early Airbus ‘proving flight’ between Hong Kong and Frankfurt. But never before at the controls. And I am truly an untrained amateur. So here’s the scene. I am sitting with safety straps on in a straight backed supportive pilot’s seat inside the vast cockpit of this leviathan of the skies with – in the real world anyway – nearly 500 passengers behind me. Actress Gemma Arterton launched British Airways' 'Red Carpet Route' to LA earlier this year . The A380 flight simulator is designed to mimic the movements of the plane in flight . The Airbus A380 is a double-decker plane with room for 469 passengers . I am looking out through the wraparound cockpit window at the freakily lifelike but entirely computer-generated runway and control tower of Los Angeles International airport. Immediately in front, behind and above me is a vast array of illuminated buttons, lights, switches and controls. It makes the flight deck of the Starship Enterprise look like a piece of cake. To my left is arguably the most important piece of kit on this fly-by-wire plane – the joystick. It’s not child’s play. But I’d wager many children who irritate their parents by spending hours on their computer games with a force-feedback joystick would be better placed than many adults when it comes to being prepared for what happens next. We’re set up for take-off, so Richard instructs me push forward on the power. We rumble along the runway picking up speed as I wait to hit the magic 130knots. Stay calm. Concentrate. As Richard reads out ‘135’ I ease back on the joystick and the rumble retreats as we gently but powerfully take to the skies. We’re airborne. As we ascend for a minute or so and then level out the noise of the engines recedes and  I take in the scene below. A lovely day, great views of LA and the coast. I take a lazy arc around the Hollywood Hills, then down to  Santa Monica to wave at the ‘Baywatch’ branch of my Massey clan relatives. A light touch is needed to keep the plane from flapping all over the place from over-corrections. You’re a chauffeur not a jet fighter pilot. Experience of driving supercars and their speed-sensitive steering may help, however, to reduce the risk of  the plane ‘boating’ back and forth. What goes up must come down so landing was next. Sweaty palms time. 'Your life will be safe in my hands': The Daily Mail's Ray Massey is confident his simulator experience means he could man a plane in an emergency . Richard helpfully provided all the settings. I had to guide it in keeping to the glide path, keeping it straight, and keeping it high – or low – enough. Eyes on the landing lights. Half red and half white is the ideal. A bit too far to the left and a tilt on the tiller. Steady as she goes. Nose up a bit. As you get closer the ground rushes up: three, two, one,  a little clunk – hardly an angel’s footsteps – but we’re down. Relief and joy all round. For my next flight it was a night-time take off from New York’s JFK and an evening’s birds’ eye cruise around the skyscrapers of Manhattan – slightly disconcerting initially given the memories of the 9-11 tragedy. But once into my stride a loop past the Empire State building, the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge was fun. This time though the landing wasn’t. With an evil glint Richard programmed in some turbulence and a bit of cross-wind, just to test my mettle. I even had a couple of minutes white-out fog and cloud  to try it on instruments only. As I vectored in and battled with the wind, my respect for real plots grew enormously. I landed. The plane did land back in the Big Apple, but let’s just say ‘touchdown’ doesn’t really cover it and I would not like to have been a passenger. Bear in mind this is not a static activity. This cockpit is inside a giant pod – a bit like the shuttle craft on Star Trek - held up on powerful hydraulics which react exactly to programed to conditions and to your flying. It really is rock’n’roll. Get it wrong and it bucks like a bronco. During the session we also simulated what in aviation is benignly termed a ‘loss of separation’ – or to you and me ‘a near miss'. Bad enough the sight of another plane shooting across your vision. The automated ‘TCAS’ collision avoidance system kicks in telling you ‘Descend, descend, descend.’ Actually it is so clever that the rival planes communicate electronically so that each is instructed to take opposing  avoiding action that keeps them apart. The simulator is the latest of 16 which BA uses to train its pilots on all Boeing and Airbus planes in its fleet. This is the only A380 simulator and is not yet open to the public. But the others are available for private and corporate hire in a variety of packages at rates from £399 for an hour or £1,197 for three hours at www.ebaft.com. Curiously that’s about the same cost as a real long-haul return flight to the West Coast. Ray Massey took the simulated A380 on flights from Los Angeles and New York's JFK airports . BA is already taking superjumbo bookings for A380 flights from London Heathrow to Los Angeles from October 15 starting at £499 return in economy and £1,900 in Club World business. There are 469 seats in total of which 14 are first class ‘upstairs’. Actress Gemma Arterton said: 'It’s very exciting that  A380 will be flying to Los Angeles. I think the red carpet route will be very popular.’ BA chief executive Keith Williams said: 'The A380 is a great aircraft that has been developed with huge amounts of British engineering ingenuity. London and los Angeles are two world-leading cities and we are proud to be the first airline to connect them with the A380.’ Flights to Hong Kong begin in mid November  from £599 return in economy. Another thing to consider. It takes 18 months and £100,000 to train a commercial airline pilot from scratch, that’s  once he or she passes the strict entry criteria, including no colour blindness. To make captain will take up to 12 years, and on some long-haul flights between 15 and 20. So back to my dodgy prawn in the cockpit scenario. What, I asked my tutor Richard,  in the worst case ‘unlikely event’ is the one button on this vast cockpit dashboard that I should press if I really needed to get  out of trouble? He pointed to a small yellow illuminated button at the centre. ‘Press that. That’s the autopilot. It’ll even land the plane for you,’ he said. See, I told you you’d be safe in my hands. Each Airbus A380 costs £250million, while the simulator alone is worth £10million .","Daily Mail's Ray Massey takes the helm of BA's Airbus A380 simulator .

Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, the Vatican's culture minister, opened the ‘Cubicle of Lazzaro’ which is a tiny burial chamber featuring 4th century images of biblical scenes, the Apostles Peter and Paul, and one of the early Romans buried there in bunk-bed-like stacks as was common in antiquity.

Proponents of a female priesthood say frescoes  prove there were women priests in early Christianity. The Vatican says such assertions are 'sensationalist fairy tales' The catacombs of Priscilla, on Rome's Via Salaria, have been fully reopened after a five-year project that included laser technology to clean some of the ancient frescoes and a new museum to house restored marble fragments of sarcophagi.

AD - the earliest known image of the Madonna and Child. More controversially, the catacomb has two scenes said by proponents of the women's ordination movement to show women priests. One fresco in the ochre-hued Greek Chapel features a group of women celebrating a banquet, said to be the banquet of the Eucharist. Another image, in a room called the 'Cubiculum of the Veiled Woman,' shows a woman whose arms are outstretched like those of a priest saying Mass. She wears what the catacombs' Italian website calls 'a rich liturgical garment'. She also wears what appears to be a stole, a vestment worn by priests. The Association of Roman Catholic Women Priests holds the images up as evidence that there were women priests in the early Christian church - and that therefore there should be women priests today. But Fabrizio Bisconti, the superintendent of the Vatican's sacred archaeology commission, said such a reading of the frescoes was pure ‘fable, a legend.’ Even though the catacombs' official guide says there is ‘a clear reference to the banquet of the Holy Eucharist’ in the fresco, Bisconti said the scene of the banquet wasn't a Eucharistic banquet but a funeral banquet. A marble low-relief decorating a sarcophagus is pictured inside the catacomb of Priscilla in Rome . The Vatican has restricted the priesthood for men, arguing that Jesus chose only men as his apostles. Here a man's face from the Roman catacombs is pictured . He said that even though women were present they weren't celebrating Mass. Bisconti said the other fresco of the woman with her hands up in prayer was just that - a woman praying. ‘These are readings of the past that are a bit sensationalistic but aren't trustworthy,’ he said. Asked about the scenes, Ravasi professed ignorance and referred comment to Bisconti. A skull is pictured inside the catacomb of Priscilla in Rome.

The video, dated Thursday, shows the car slowing down for a red light when the SUV driver overtakes on the outside, only for the van to crash into the road rubble. It erupts into three large pieces, sending a cloud of dust into the air. A second car only missed it by moments when the driver turned right barely seconds earlier. The car is tipped sideways on impact but the driver was able to walk away from the crash . Experts who have seen the footage believe it was caused by an exploding gas main. Howard Robinson, chief executive of the Road Surface Treatments Association, who has seen the video, said: 'It looks like a gas main has exploded.

Children's nativity costumes are selling for more than three times their value on eBay as desperate parents struggle to find last minute costumes for nursery and school plays. Parents are frantically bidding against each other for shepherd, angel, wise men, Mary and Joseph costumes as supermarkets sell out of the dressing-up clothes. Used and homemade angel costumes are selling for up to an incredible £32 on eBay, whilst king costumes are going for more than £20 and shepherd costumes for up to £22. George at Asda is selling nativity costumes for £8 - including King, shepherd and sheep - but parents have found sizes sell out fast as time-poor parents buy instead of make their child's school nativity outfits . Traditional: Children from Little Downham primary school in Cambridgeshire show off their homemade outfits . Many of the outfits have been posted by savvy parents, who have snapped up bargains at supermarkets, such as Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's, where the costumes cost around £8 each. A lot of the nativity clothes have now sold out in the supermarket stores or on their websites, so prices are rocketing on eBay. 'We've only just been told that our son is a shepherd in the school play and most of the supermarkets have sold out of his size, so I've had to buy on eBay,"" said Catherine Wallis, 37, from Cambridge. 'It's very annoying when I could have bought a similar costume for less a third of the price a few weeks ago.' Hot property: An angel costume similar to those that sell for £8 in Asda recently sold for £24 on auction site eBay . A spokesman for eBay said sales of nativity costumes had shot up by 102 per cent over the last fortnight on eBay.co.uk. He said sales of nativity wear were also up 57 per cent compared to this time last year and there were currently 3,000 outfits listed on the site. 'This Christmas we've seen sales of nativity costumes shoot up as savvy parents have been flocking to the site en masse to get their children kitted out,' he said. A spokesman for Asda said there has been a 40 per cent increase in sales of single tea towels and its multi-buy five pack tea towels, which the supermarket has attributed to mothers making homemade shepherd headdresses. Harriet Oliver, 40, from Fulham, south west London, said: ‘I spent days trawling the internet looking for a King or Wise Man costume for my son, Rupert, who is six, to wear in his nativity play. 'I looked on every site I could think of but everything had sold out in his size – all I could find was one costume that was £40, which was far too much. 'I was desperate, and my son was horrifed at the prospect of me cobbling something together with my rusty sewing skills, but eventually a friend found him a brilliant costume at Asda. ‘Next year I will start looking earlier, but the schools don’t tend to tell you what part your child has until December anyway, so it’s always a rush.' Julie Froggatt, 37, from Haringay, north London, said: 'I was given just a few days to make my children's costumes after the school left it until the week of the play to send a letter telling us which part our child had. 'I was keen to make the costumes rather than buy them - ours were always homemade when we were young and I have such fond memories of our wonky outfits - but I didn't even have a weekend to get together fabric and have a go. 'I ended up buying my daughter's outfit, but my son was a shepherd so he got the bed sheet plus tea towel treatment. 'His outfit looked very cute - and exactly the same as the school play shepherds 30 or more years ago when I was in the nativity.' More than one in ten fathers would only go to their child’s nativity if they landed the part of Mary or Joseph – a new poll has found. For a hard to please 11 per cent, the only thing that would coax them away from the office would be their child getting the role of Mary or Joseph. Many of the fathers polled claimed that work commitments were the primary reason they couldn’t find the time to make their child’s Christmas play. Nevertheless, an overwhelming majority of fathers, 89 per cent, would want to go to their little one’s nativity regardless of what role they were given, found a poll by officebroker.com .","Festive costumes usually sell for around £8 at George at Asda or Tesco .

He began life in a slum apartment in the backstreets of Calcutta, yet rose to become the Royal footman who announced Prince George’s birth to an expectant nation. To the cheers of thousands of people standing patiently outside Buckingham Palace, it was Badar Azim who strode proudly across the courtyard with the Queen’s Press Secretary Ailsa Anderson to mount the official acknowledgement of the baby’s safe arrival on an ornate easel. Resplendent in his scarlet and black footman’s outfit, the uniform gave no clue to his humble background. Scroll down for video . Moment of glory: Footman Badar Azim with the Queen's Press Secretary Ailsa Anderson holding the announcement of Prince George's birth . It is hard to imagine a prouder moment for a young man who has worked his way up from one of the most poverty-stricken corners of the world. It was a mere twist of fate that Badar, 25, happened to be on duty at the Privy Purse door after the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to the third in line to the Throne. But this simple coincidence seems fitting in a 21st Century fairytale that has delighted his impoverished family in India. Badar’s father Mohammed Rahim, a 52-year-old welder who earns £33 a month, and his mother Mumtaz Begum, 41, still live in the same slum dwelling in a rundown area of Calcutta where Badar spent his childhood. They are overwhelmed to be thrown into the spotlight thanks to their son’s success. But according to the footman’s brother Mazhar, 20, who spoke to him after his starring role in delivering the news of the Royal birth, Badar himself has taken the whole experience in his stride. Joyous occasion: Badar Azim, right, enjoyed a proud moment announcing the birth on Monday . ‘He acted very normal about  it but it was a proud moment for  him,’ said Mazhar. ‘My parents are  so proud. They knew nothing about the British Royal Family before he got the job. They were really surprised. ‘We did not know about any of it beforehand. We only read about it in the newspapers. My parents think Badar is blessed.’ Standing in their dank, two-room home, which is shared between nine members of their extended family including Badar’s other brother, 14-year-old Md Sameer, the footman’s mother added: ‘I am feeling on top of the world.’ To give you an idea of just how far Badar has travelled in his 25 years, just getting inside his family home requires negotiating several water-logged flights of stairs. A bed dominates the shabby main room. In terms of other material assets, all the family own is a television and a couple of plastic chairs. But although Badar’s father was barely able to afford to put food on the table, he valued the importance of education and scrimped and saved to send Badar to school. ‘We were an economically challenged family,’ said Mazhar quietly. ‘Our parents let us boys sleep on the bed and they slept on the floor. But my father wanted us to go to a good school so that we could learn. ‘He even borrowed money so that we could go forward.’ After struggling at a public school in the city, Badar was taken in by the charitable St Mary’s Orphanage and Day School. Run by the Congregation of Christian Brothers of Ireland, it aims to help the destitute, homeless and underprivileged. Badar thrived in his new environment. ‘He is a funny guy and very creative,’ added Mazhar. ‘He used to play sports a lot. He was very enthusiastic but also serious about his studies.’ Escape route: St Mary's Orphanage Day School in Calcutta which Badar Azim attended before moving to the UK . The orphanage later sponsored Badar to go to the International Institute of Hotel Management College in Calcutta, where he embarked on a degree in hospitality management. Sanjukta Bose, the director of  the college, recalls an eager and diligent student. ‘He was a decent boy who never created any problems,’  she said. ‘He was well-mannered and a good communicator. He was also punctual, well-groomed and decent, which is essential for roles in hotel management.’ After completing his first two years at the Institute, the orphanage raised another £10,000 to fly Badar to Scotland, where he completed his degree at Edinburgh’s Napier University. He lived in digs in the Scottish capital, where he cooked his own curries because he could not get used to British cuisine. During his final year at Napier, Badar organised a ten-mile charity walk to raise money for the orphanage’s sponsorship scheme. He graduated on June 15, 2011, and landed a job as a junior footman at Buckingham Palace in February the following year. ‘The conditions I live in now are so different from how I lived in India,’ he said. ‘The orphanage literally helps transform . the lives of hundreds of children each year. The charity enabled me to . come to Edinburgh and complete my studies – something others in India . can only dream of. Humble begginngs: Azim, pictured in the yellow t-shirt, with his old classmates . ‘If I hadn’t gone to St Mary’s, I would be working somewhere on the streets of Calcutta. It would have been very difficult to get a job in India because unless you have a good degree, you will not get a good job and a good salary.’ Pauline Gordon, a lecturer at Edinburgh’s Napier University, who leads the India Partnership – a scheme to bring disadvantaged children from the subcontinent to Britain – said: ‘Badar is the sweetest of boys I have met. ‘He’s particularly shy, quite reserved and old-fashioned. He’s also humble, polite and gracious. ‘He used to call me Ma’am but I told him to call me Pauline so now he calls me Pauline Ma’am – and I am only his teacher! ‘I got the shock of my life seeing him on television. I am so proud of him. He has done extremely well. ‘It took him a good few months to get the job at the Palace – he had a first interview and then the staff had to check out his credentials in India. ‘But he loves working at Buckingham Palace. He has been there for 18 months and has met the Queen. ‘At the moment he’s trying to extend his visa to stay in the country. ‘It runs out in October so he is trying to get the paperwork together and sort it out.’ On the tiny island of Nauru, they still talk about a visit the Queen made more than 30 years ago. But the momentous news of a new Royal baby has barely caused a ripple in the smallest nation in the Commonwealth. As The Mail on Sunday toured the once British-ruled island, it became clear many residents had no idea a future King had been born. But as we broke the news, the message for William and Kate was clear: ‘Bring George to see us!’ Poster boy: Students and teachers at Nauru College cheering the birth of Prince George . There are no newspapers on Nauru and only one television network, which is watched by just a few of the 11,000 inhabitants. The internet is notoriously unreliable. Over breakfast at the Sunset Cafe in Nauru’s central business district yesterday, most people were unaware of the Royal birth. At a nearby market, we showed off a picture of the new infant. Clothes stallholder Corina Deduna said:  ‘I had no idea about this. He’s beautiful. I’d better get some Royal blue baby clothes with George on them.’ We also visited Nauru College, where a photo of the Queen and Prince Philip arriving in 1982  is still displayed on a noticeboard, and broke the news to a classroom of children and their teacher. Student Azaria Jones, 15, said: ‘It would be the best thing if William and Kate could come here with baby George.’ George is a popular name in Nauru, but Atniza Batsiua, 15, suggested a Nauruan name to add to his others: Oyon. ‘It means strong,’ she explained. ‘I think Kate is very pretty and they all make a good family.’ King George V’s state visit to India in 1911 marked the apogee of the British Raj. The centrepiece of the visit was a nine-day ceremony culminating in the Delhi Durbar on December 12, during which George V and Queen Mary were presented as Emperor and Empress of India  to princes, noblemen and landowners, as  well as a crowd of more than half a million ordinary people. During a hunting trip in Nepal, the King’s party shot 21 tigers and eight rhinos.

'Obviously that young man went there to end his own life. We may not be that lucky next time,' Christie said.

Authorities said he had a known drug problem. Chaos erupted shortly before the mall's 9:30 p.m. closing time Monday when authorities said a man dressed in black and wearing a motorcycle helmet fired six shots. Molinelli said the gun, which was modified to look like an AK-47 assault rifle, belonged to Richard Shoop's brother, who owned it legally and did not give the shooter permission to take it.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 17:47 EST, 20 February 2012 . Two spurned women who went online to warn other woman to stay well away from a Lothario had the case against them thrown out in court today. Former roller-derby queen Stacey Blitsch and Amanda Ryncarz celebrated the victory at a Los Angeles news conference today over their lover, Matthew Couloute Jr. The two women originally made a website saying that Couloute was a no-good Lothario and dumped Miss Ryncarz over the phone a week before marrying someone else. Vindicated: Former roller jam star Stacey Blitsch, left, and Amanda Ryncarz, right, won the right to continue slamming their ex . Done and out: Attorney Matthew Couloute's case was thrown out by a judge who said that the two women are entitled to their opinions . Attorney Matthew Couloutte Jr. claims the two women posted defamatory insults about him on a website. One anonymous post claimed: 'Our relationship didn't last long, as I figured him out pretty quickly, but for others, BE FOREWARNED, HE'S SCUM! RUN FAR AWAY!' Miss Blitsch, who has a son with the lawyer, claims she did not write any posts, while Miss Ryncarz argues her comments were truthful and should be covered by free speech. 'I do believe that women should have a legal right to share information with each other, if they feel they have been betrayed in a relationship,' she said. Defence: Celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred (centre), who is representing Stacey Blitsch (left) and Amanda Ryncarz (right), speaks at a press conference in September . Celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred represented the two women and told the New York Post: ‘Given the fact that legislatures and courts do not protect women against liars and cheaters, women helping women by warning them may be the only means by which women can protect themselves.’ Ex: Stacey Blitsch is fighting for the right to share information about ex-boyfriends . In his lawsuit, Couloute claimed the former roller jam television star and Ms Ryncarz have cost him clients and nearly cost him his dream home after their post on LiarsCheatersRUs.com landed at the top of Google when searching his name. The judge overseeing the case said Couloute failed to prove the women were using their words to poison clients against him. He also refused to let Couloute revise his suit to include charges of defamation. ‘The average reader would know that the comments are “emotionally charged rhetoric” and the “opinions of disappointed lovers,”’ Judge Harold Baer wrote. The Post reported that Couloute intends to appeal the ruling. Mr Couloute, in a video interview with . Fox News, said he was filing suit against the women for 'tortuous . interference with prospective business relations'. The cheating website, which ranks first during a Google search of his name, includes a series of anonymous posts. One claims: ‘He is . very, very manipulating, he's an attorney so he's great at lying and . covering it up without batting an eye' Mr Couloute told the network: 'It’s unfortunate... Anyone can slander someone anonymously and just get away with it.' '[They] don’t have the right to defame people on the Internet,' he continued. Ms Blitsch, 35, who has a son with the . lawyer, claims she did not write any posts, while Ms Ryncarz, 26, has . argued her comments were truthful and should be covered by free speech. ‘I posted on Liarscheatersrus.com . because I wanted to warn other women in order to protect them from what I . suffered,’ Ms Ryncarz said in a statement issued last September.

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 09:05 EST, 9 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:22 EST, 9 December 2013 . A 10-year-old girl died needlessly after a catalogue of serious blunders at a much-criticised hospital. Arina Durbazeva had suffered from epilepsy since she was one and and died of a heart attack when staff at Basildon Hospital were unable to stop her fitting. An inquest into Arina’s death heard that junior doctors were unable to administer drugs to the her because they were past their use by date. Arina Durbazeva, 10, was taken to Basildon Hospital after she had an epileptic fit. Due to a catalogue of errors, doctors failed to stop her fitting and she suffered a heart attack. She died two days later . No senior doctors were on the ward after 5pm and the on-call locum consultant chose to stay at home when he was contacted. Chelmsford Coroners’ Court was told Arina suffered an epileptic seizure at her school but it had been stopped thanks to an anti-seizure drug. She was rushed to Basildon Hospital where she suffered a second seizure soon after arriving at 4.20pm on October 12 last year. A series of errors meant it was not controlled. Arina suffered a heart attack at 6.05pm and stopped breathing for 14 minutes. She was rushed to St Mary’s Hospital, London, but died two days later. The coroner recorded a narrative verdict, meaning she could not attribute the death to a named individual. Arina's father, Arkadiys Durbazeva . said: 'There is a void in our understanding of how a situation as dire . as this was allowed to exist in a hospital.' He . told the inquest he disputed hospital records and believes his . daughter's seizure could have lasted for as long as an hour and 45 . minutes. After her heart attack, Arina was taken to St Mary's Hospital in London but doctors there were unable to save her. The coroner recorded a narrative verdict meaning no individual could be held responsible for her death . He said: 'There are definite discrepancies between our understanding and the definitions of certain events given and the time scales. 'Unless we get satisfactory answers, we reserve the right to seek further responses.' Hospital bosses have now apologised to Arina’s devastated family. Clare Panniker, chief executive of the hospital trust, said: ‘I want to say how sorry I am that we failed to provide the best care for Arina. ‘I also want to assure her family that she will not be forgotten and will remain at the forefront of our minds as we seek to improve the care we provide to all our patients.’ Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray was told of the hospital’s failings which let Arina down. These included an ‘inexperienced’ medic struggling to mix a dose of the necessary drug which had been successful in stopping Arina’s seizure when she was at school. Junior doctors on the ward decided . against using three other types of drug after the initial treatment . failed because they were past their use by dates. When Arina was at Basildon hospital there were no senior doctors on the ward and an on-call consultant was contacted but decided to stay at home . But investigations later concluded that they should have attempted to use the drugs anyway. And despite Arina’s rapidly deteriorating condition, there were repeated delays in alerting an on-call consultant. Doctor Rotimi Jaiyesimi, Basildon Hospital's director of patient safety, carried out an internal investigation into the incident. He told the inquest questions were raised about the decision of the on-call consultant Dr Mohamed Ramadan to stay at home. He said: 'The consultant should have probed further about the deterioration. It is difficult for me to comment on his decision to stay at home.' Dr Ramadan no longer works for the trust and is now based in Libya so was not called to give evidence. The coroner, Caroline Beasley-Murray, also heard that doctors at Basildon Hospital were unable to give Arina the drugs she needed because they were past their use by date . A post-mortem concluded the . schoolgirl died from multiple organ failure caused by epilepsy, an . associated brain problem and obesity. Following Arina’s death there have been two independent reviews and a plan put in place to prevent a repeat of the tragedy. Improvements . include regular drug date checks, consultants remaining on site until . 9pm and ‘tailor-made’ care plans for patients with complex medical . conditions. Mrs Beasley-Murray said: ‘I am pleased to see there have been some improvements in places but they must be on-going and must be implemented. ‘There is no point having an action plan unless it is implemented fully so little girls like this much-loved little girl are not at risk.’ The hospital claims that since Arina’s death, there have been major changes. Mrs Panniker said: ‘We have worked tirelessly to learn lessons from Arina’s death and, as a result, the care we provide for children has been transformed. ‘A review of the way we manage medicines had also been undertaken to ensure they are available and in stock at all times.’ After Arina’s death, the Care Quality Commission branded children’s services at the hospital ‘completely unacceptable’. In a statement the trust said: ‘Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust would like to send its condolences to the family of Arina Durbazeva at this difficult time. ‘We are sorry we failed to provide the care that Arina needed and have worked tirelessly to learn lessons from her death. ‘Two independent reviews of paediatric services have taken place at the Trust and as a result the care we provide to children has been transformed. ‘We now employ higher numbers of specialist paediatric nurses and three additional consultants and have changed the way some children access paediatric services out of hours to ensure that they are safe at all times. ‘A review of the way we manage medicines has also been undertaken to ensure they are available and in stock at all times.’","Arina Durbazeva was taken to Basildon Hospital after having a fit .

Many people can reminisce about the amazing worlds they built with Lego as children, but few creations could be as impressive as the mountainous home of dwarves crafted by two teenagers. Blake Baer, 17 and Jack Bittner, 18, from Pennsylvania U.S. have recreated one of the locations described in J.R.R. Tolkien’s novel, The Hobbit in painstaking detail, using a staggering 80,000 Lego bricks. The duo chose to replicate Erebor using the small colour bricks, which is the home of the dwarves in the novel. Blake Baer, 17, (left) and Jack Bittner, 18, (right) have recreated one of the locations described in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, The Hobbit in painstaking detail, using a staggering 80,000 Lego bricks . The pair invested over 400 hours making the detailed model, which includes a windmill, stream and marketplace beneath the towering mountain with its craggy face. The model weighs 200 pounds and the peak of the mountain measures 56 inches tall, according to Gizmodo. Baer and Bittner have shown off images of their creation ahead of the release of the second Hobbit film, which is called The Desolation of Smaug and is due to be released in the UK on December 13. Writing on Lego fan site, MOC Pages Mr Baer said: 'I really enjoy building natural landscapes so I often build creations from Lord of the Rings, a fantastic book series by J.R.R. Tolkien that has some incredible landscapes in it. 'However, I try to branch out into other genres every so often. One of the best things about Lego in my opinion is that it is such an incredible medium to use your creativity and God-given talents to express your imagination in a material and understandable way.' The pair invested over 400 hours making the detailed model, which includes a windmill, stream and marketplace beneath the towering mountain with its craggy face . The model weighs 200 pounds and the peak of the mountain measures 56 inches tall and is made up of over 80,000 individual Lego bricks . It is not the first time the duo have created impressive models inspired by the children’s novel. Last year, the pair made the elven sanctuary of Rivendell, which took them 100 hours of work and used over 50,000 Lego bricks. However, while it was incredibly detailed, it was not quite as large as their current creation as it weighed 120 pounds and measured 40 by 30 inches.

It may not be one of life’s great mysteries, but the lack of vast amounts of fossilised dinosaur faeces has baffled scientists for years. However, Slovakian researchers believe the answer lies in the diet of cockroaches, which might have dined on dinosaur waste millions of years ago. Using cutting-edge imaging methods, the scientists discovered particles of wood inside an ancient cockroach’s gut, which they think came from dinosaur faeces.

A preserved cockroach caught in the act of relieving itself is pictured in figure a and its fossilised poo is pictured bottom right . Researchers from the Slovak Academy of Sciences in Slovakia said that dinosaurs certainly must have produced a lot of faeces, and yet fossils of the waste are not very widely discovered. ‘Although appearing trivial, cockroaches, one of the dominant insect orders during the Mesozoic, were never examined as representing top candidates for partial processors of dinosaur dung,’ they wrote in their study, published in the journal PLOS ONE. Ancient cockroaches from the extinct Blattulidae family lived alongside herbivore dinosaurs between 250 million and 65 million years ago, LiveScience reported. The scientists used a technique called synchrotron X-ray microtomography to make a 3D model of a fossilised cockroach preserved in a chunk of 120-million-year-old amber discovered in Lebanon. Ancient cockroaches from the extinct Blattulidae family lived alongside herbivore dinosaurs between 250 million and 65 million years ago. A modern giant Madagascar hissing cockroach is pictured . The cockroach in question died while it was going to the toilet, leaving behind a fossilised poo, called a coprolite that contains tiny pieces of wood. As the wood particles had smooth edges, the researchers said the cockroach did not chew them and its digestive system was not able to digest wood. The scientists therefore believe that the insect must have eaten the faeces of a herbivorous dinosaur. Other fossilised species of the . cockroaches have been discovered with undigested carbon in their guts, . but it is only the specimen examined in the study that has been found to . have indirectly eaten wood.

Surgeons in Spain have removed a giant tumour from a woman’s stomach that was 17 inches long and weighed 3st 9lb. The doctors at Torrevieja Hospital, in eastern Spain, say the tumour was attached to the 47-year-old patient’s womb. Dr Eduardo Cazorla, head of the hospital’s Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, said that in his 20-year career had never dealt with a similar case. A 3st 9lb tumour (pictured) was removed from a 47-year-old woman's abdomen during a two hour operation in Spain. The tumour was 41cm long and reached from her pubic bone to her sternum . The surgical team say giant gynaecological tumours – defined as those weighing more than 1st 8lb – are very rare and that only five similar cases have ever been reported in scientific literature. The patient was referred to the hospital by her GP after suffering weight gain and pain in her stomach. The 55lb tumour was so large it was also causing her bowel problems, difficulty sleeping, breathing problems and discomfort while walking. Doctors carried out a series of tests and found a huge cystic tumour which was 41cm long. It stretched from her pubic bone to her sternum. During an operation, surgeons successfully removed the tumour as well as the patient’s womb, ovaries and fallopian tubes. The patient was referred to the hospital after suffering stomach pain and weight gain. She was also struggling with bowel problems, breathing difficulties and pain while walking (file picture) Since the surgery the patient has made a full recovery and there are no signs of the tumour returning.

The guide, from health statistics firm Dr Foster, looked at four indicators: Deaths in hospital, deaths within 30 days of the patient leaving hospital, deaths . after surgery and deaths among people with low-risk conditions who would . normally survive. Of the 16 trusts, 13 scored poorly on at least two out of these four main indicators. Sixteen NHS trusts in England have higher than expected death rates, including Blackpool Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust which runs Blackpool Victoria Hospital (pictured) Of these 13 trusts, five were investigated earlier in the year by NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh over concerns about their standards of care. They were Blackpool, Medway, North Cumbria, Northern Lincolnshire and Goole, and United Lincolnshire hospital trusts. In today’s analysis, Blackpool had higher than expected death rates across three out of the four indicators. Overall, today’s report showed that 28 trusts had lower than expected in-hospital death rates. The number with higher rates has also fallen to 16 from 20 last year.

Breakthrough: A new contact lens could release a steady flow of drugs to combat glaucoma (file photo) A new contact lens which releases drugs slowly into the eye could be the next weapon to treat glaucoma, the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness. The method has been proposed for 50 years to replace inefficient eyedrops but has been held up by technology, which left scientists unable to provide a steady dose over time. But American researchers say they have for the first time developed a lens which can deliver a regulated dose of latanoprost, a common glaucoma drug, for up to a month. The study by Havard Medical School and the . Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been hailed as a key step forward in the fight against the disease, which affects 480,000 people in Britain. Glaucoma occurs when the drainage tubes within the eye become slightly blocked preventing eye fluid, aqueous humour, from draining properly. This builds up pressure which can damage the optic nerve. The condition can be treated with eye drops, laser treatment or surgery, but there is no perfect option. Cornea specialist Dr Joseph Ciolino said: 'In general, eye drops are an inefficient method of drug delivery that has notoriously poor patient adherence. 'This contact lens design can potentially be used as a treatment for glaucoma and as a platform for other ocular drug delivery applications.' The lenses were designed by encasing a . thin film containing the drug inside the edges of the absorbent plastic . used to make contact lenses. Glaucoma is the main cause of irreversible blindness and affects 480,000 people in Britain (file photo) Tests found single contact lenses were able to achieve, for one month, latanoprost concentrations in the eye fluid that were comparable to those achieved with eyedrops. The treatment could be combined into contact lenses which patients already wear to correct their eyesight. Professor Daniel Kohane added: 'The . lens we have developed is capable of delivering large amounts of drug at . substantially constant rates over weeks to months.' The findings were published in the journal Biomaterials. Dr Ciolino claimed they could help 'save millions from preventable blindness'.","Measure has been proposed for 50 years but held up by technical problems .

Arm bone fragments from a 1.34-million-year-old hominin, Paranthropus boisei, were discovered by an international research team . A human ancestor that was characterised by a 'robust' jaw and skull bones was also a muscular creature that had a gorilla-like upper body. Bones have revealed that one of our ancient ancestor was more adaptive to its environment than previously thought. Researchers found the partial skeleton -- including arm, hand, leg and foot fragments -- dating back 1.34 million years at at the Olduvai Gorge World Heritage fossil site in Tanzania. The skeleton belonged to a Paranthropus boisei hominid which lived across Africa side-by-side with direct ancestors of humans. Researchers believe the creature stood 3.5 to 4.5 feet tall, was very strong and had a robust frame. The find, published in PLOS ONE, represents one of the most recent occurrences of Paranthropus boisei before its extinction in East Africa. 'This is the first time we've found bones that suggest that this creature was more ruggedly built - combining terrestrial bipedal locomotion and some arboreal behaviours - than we'd previously thought,' said Charles Musiba, associate professor of anthropology at the University of Colorado Denver. 'It seems to have more well-formed forearm muscles that were used for climbing, fine-manipulation and all sorts of behaviour.'

The species . was part of a line of close human relatives known as australopithecines . that includes the famous three million-year-old Ethiopian fossil Lucy, . seen by some as the matriarch of modern humans. Roughly . 2.3 million years ago, the australopithecines are thought to have split . into the genus Homo - which produced modern Homo sapiens - and the . genus Paranthropus, that dead-ended. Researchers believe the creature stood 3.5 to 4.5 feet tall, was very strong and had a robust frame. The size of the arm bones suggests strong forearms and a powerful upper body. 'We know that it was very strong,' Professor Musiba said. 'It's unprecedented to find how strong this individual was. The stronger you are the more adaptive you are.' Mary Leakey discovered the first skull of Paranthropus boisei in 1959 in northern Tanzania. While Paranthropus boisei was known for its massive jaws and cranium, the build of the rest of the ancient hominin's body has been unknown until recently. During excavations at Olduvai in 2010-2011, the team discovered the partial skeleton of a large adult individual who is represented by various teeth and skeletal parts.

The species was part of a line of close human relatives known as australopithecines that includes the famous three million-year-old Ethiopian fossil Lucy, seen by some as the matriarch of modern humans.

Roughly 2.3 million years ago, the australopithecines are thought to have split into the genus Homo - which produced modern Homo sapiens - and the genus Paranthropus, that dead-ended. In the absence of evidence of other skeletal remains, it was commonly assumed that the skeleton of Paranthropus boisei was like that of more ancient species of the genus Australopithecus. 'We are starting to understand the physiology of these individuals of this particular species and how it actually adapted to the kind of habitat it lived in,' Professor Musiba said. 'We knew about the kind of food it ate -- it was omnivorous, leaning more toward plant material -- but now we know more: how it walked around and now we know it was a tree climber.' Researchers found the partial skeleton dating back 1.34 million years at at the Olduvai Gorge World Heritage fossil site in Tanzania . The size of the arm bones suggests strong forearms and a powerful upper body. 'It's a different branch on our ancestry tree,' Professor  Musiba said. 'It came later than the other hominins, so the question now is ""what happened to it?"" We're going to do more work on biomechanics and see what else this creature was doing.' In summer 2014, the bones will be displayed as part of a large exhibit on human origins in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The joint-museum exhibit involves the Museum of Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain, the Regional Museum of Archaeology in Madrid, and the National Museum of Dar es Salaam. With each find scientists are adding to the understanding of how humans evolved and adapted to their surroundings through time.

Watch out Emmys...the master of movie awards Harvey Weinstein is heading to TV. Harvey, 61, and his brother Bob are launching a series of shows - and aim to make their TV arm just as powerful as their theatrical division. The Weinstein Company, the firm the brothers set up eight years ago, is planning a 10-episode detective drama set in ancient Egypt called Book of the . Dead, alongside 10 Commandments. The Weinsteins are already planning to hire A'list directors as far ranging as Lee Daniels, who recently helmed The Butler for The Weinstein Copany, Madonna, Wes Craven and Ryan Cooglar, to direct episodes. A source told MailOnline: 'TV is a big part of the future for The Weinstein Company. 'Harvey is looking more and more at TV as a significant part of the future of the company and is hoping to replicate his film success in the TV world.' Last week, Harvey spoke out about his plans, and told the New York Times: 'The way to add stability to the company is to be in the television business,' adding his goal was to create a television operation “as powerful as the theatrical division.” Asked whether some of his past and . present Oscar contenders might lead to future television shows, Harvey said he saw potential, for instance, in “Silver Linings . Playbook,” a comedy-drama which received eight Oscar nominations - and a best actress Oscar for Jennifer Lawrence. Other planned shows from The Weinstein Company are “Marco Polo,” a martial . arts-filled adventure series from the executive producer John Fusco for . Netflix; “War and Peace,” a 14-episode retelling of Tolstoy’s Napoleonic . war novel in association with the BBC; “Stan and Ollie,” about the . later days of the Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy comedy team, also for the . BBC, and possible for sale in the States and an “Entourage”-like comic series, . based loosely on the adventures of the celebrity chef Michael Chiarello. The company has also acquired rights to “Peaky Blinders,” a . British crime series, and “Gomorrah,” an Italian mob drama, both of . which are being offered for sale in the United States, the New York Times reported. Still a hit: Charlton Heston as Moses in the 1956 film The Ten Commandments which is still in the top ten grossing films of all time when adjusted for inflation . Those . scripted shows join reality shows including . “Concrete Kings,” about the construction business, and “Rodeo Girls,” about female rodeo competitors, both for A&E; and “Under the Gunn” a . spinoff of the company’s continuing “Project Runway” series on . Lifetime . With Harvey's flare for showmanship and promotion, TV chiefs think the Weinstein Company's projects could be a success. Richard Plepler, chief . executive of HBO, told the New York Times: 'Would . I be surprised in the coming years if Harvey brought something to us . that makes sense for HBO? Not in the least.' The TV push is backed by money from a freshly . negotiated $370 million in available lending from an arrangement with . Union Bank. About $150 million of that is earmarked for television, The Weinstein Company's President David Glasser said. Meanwhile, Bob Weinstein said he was developing projects in tune with Dimension brand, alongside shows based on movies he has overseen. He's now developing a pilot based on the 'Scream' series for MTV and proposed a series based on Stephen King's The Mist. Mr. Weinstein said he was also hoping to quickly follow the August release . of the film “Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,” directed by Frank Miller and .

When 29-year-old Fiona Davies noticed that her socks were getting tighter in April this year, she thought she must have put on a little weight. 'But after a few days I realised that both feet and my ankles and calves were actually swollen, so I booked to see my GP,' says the trainee veterinary nurse from Northamptonshire. Blood and urine tests suggested that her kidneys were malfunctioning, so she was referred to see a nephrologist - a kidney specialist - a month later. However, before she could see the consultant the swelling started to spread upwards to her thighs. Fiona also began to feel desperately tired. 'I have a very active job, and was also playing badminton and doing gymnastics and  yoga,' she says. 'But I started struggling to keep these up. One night I came home from badminton in a lot of pain - my whole body ached and my limbs felt heavy. Eventually I stopped going altogether. No amount of sleep seemed to make anything better.' Fiona struggled on, but three days before she was due to see the nephrologist she became seriously ill. 'I spent all day out in the sun with my boyfriend, Steve. By 4pm I felt awful - feverish, achy and off my food. Then I started vomiting  and Steve insisted on taking me to A&E.' At the hospital she underwent tests - doctors also commented on a rash across her nose and cheeks. 'I thought it was just an outbreak of red spots - I'd had them for a couple of weeks but apparently it was called a butterfly rash,' she says. What Fiona didn't know was that this rash is a characteristic symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus - an autoimmune disorder in which the body starts attacking itself. It affects 50,000 people in the UK. Fiona was diagnosed with a specific form, lupus nephritis, which meant that it was attacking her kidneys. 'I was aware of the illness as I'd seen it on the TV show Embarrassing Bodies,' she says. 'All I could remember was that the guy on the show had been in a lot of pain and found life very difficult. It was shocking to be told this was what I had - I'd been perfectly healthy just weeks before and now I had an incurable illness. All I could think was, “What have I done to deserve this?”' Primary symptoms: Signs of lupus normally include fatigue, skin rash and joint pain and swelling . Lupus causes the immune system to turn on itself and start attacking healthy cells, organs and tissues - it's not known why. Ninety per cent of sufferers are women, and it generally starts between the ages of 20 and 50 - although in about 20 per cent of people it begins in childhood, usually around puberty, so it's thought that hormones may play a part in its onset. It affects certain groups much more than others - one white woman in 5,000 gets it, yet one Afro-Caribbean woman in 625 is affected. The main symptoms are fatigue, skin rash and joint pain/swelling. 'While it is incurable, it can be successfully treated with medications,' says Dr John Ioannou, consultant in adolescent and adult rheumatology at University College London Hospital. 'People with lupus tend to have flare-ups where their symptoms can be severe and debilitating, then the illness can go into remission. They can then live for months or even years between flare-ups, where they feel well. 'Medications stop the flare-ups or accelerate their resolution, and most patients respond to them.' Fiona was treated with intravenous steroids in hospital to reduce the inflammation, and discharged after ten days with a cocktail of drugs, including heavy doses of the steroid prednisolone to continue reducing inflammation, a diuretic to help banish the excess fluid and an immunosuppressant. She may need to take some of these drugs for the rest of her life, but will be able to reduce or stop others depending on how she responds. 'In the following weeks I felt incredibly weak,' says Fiona. 'My weight plummeted and I ended up back in hospital four times with various problems caused by the lupus, such as gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining). I could barely walk and lived and slept downstairs for a couple of months because walking up stairs would wipe  me out. The fatigue was so  physically and emotionally overwhelming - the best way I can describe it is that it felt painful to be awake. 'Steve was amazing, and stayed calm and strong. My employers were incredibly understanding, too - I had been just about to take my practical exams to qualify as a veterinary nurse, but had to put that on hold.' Five months later the medications seem to be working. Fiona has regular blood tests and her kidney function is back to normal. She still gets tired easily and rarely goes out to socialise, but she has managed to go back to work for two-and-a-half hours a day, three days a week. 'The fatigue was so physically and . emotionally overwhelming - the best way I can describe it is that it . felt painful to be awake.' As with most lupus patients, however, it can be difficult to predict when the illness will  flare up again. 'The cause of flare-ups is unknown,' says Dr Ioannou, 'but there are things that can be done to help prevent them. Excessive exposure to sunlight should be avoided at all times, even in winter, as it can trigger a flare-up.' This is thought to be because sun exposure causes higher cell turnover, which in turn releases genetic materials into the blood - these materials are not tolerated by people with lupus. Monique Francois, 32, from London, has been on a roller-coaster of flare-ups since she was diagnosed at 25, when she was on holiday. 'I was in St Lucia visiting relatives when I started feeling odd,' she says. 'My jet lag wouldn't wear off and I became really out of breath when walking, which was unusual as I was very fit. 'A few days later I went to the cinema and when I got up to leave, I couldn't move. My feet and lower legs had become  completely immobile and putting my feet on the ground was agonising.' Monique was carried out and taken home to rest, and the  pain subsided. But when she got back to the UK, she deteriorated rapidly and her mother took her to A&E. 'I couldn't walk and I'd  stopped eating because I felt so awful. The doctors suspected lupus and the blood tests came back positive. 'A friend of my mum's had lupus, so I knew about the illness. I was terrified and felt like a sitting duck, knowing that it can strike any part of the body at any time without warning.' Monique had trained to be an actor and was at the beginning of a promising career. But now she found herself having to be cared for 24 hours a day by her mother. 'I couldn't even dress or wash myself,' she recalls. 'I was sleeping my life away because the fatigue was so extreme. I became very depressed and my social life was non-existent. I was a shell of my former bubbly self.' After her doctors experimented with different combinations of medication without much luck, Monique finally started to improve in late 2011 - four years after the first attack. But in February 2012 blood results showed that her lupus was becoming active again. 'I'd noticed that I was getting a lot of mouth ulcers, which is a symptom of lupus,' she says. 'Within hours I began vomiting and getting terrible headaches.' Monique suffered several setbacks over the following year, including the lupus becoming active in her kidneys. However, after intensive treatment with two new drugs she has started to improve and is hoping to set up a lupus support group in her area. 'I realised that I have to learn to love my body as it is now and relearn its capabilities.' Fiona, too, is facing the illness with a positive attitude. 'I'm so appreciative of the good days I have and the little things that people do for me,' she says. 'There was a point when all I could think about was getting through the next few hours, but now that I'm feeling a little better, I can think about the future again.' lupusuk.org.uk .","Lupus is an autoimmune disorder affecting 50,000 in the UK .

It was last taught in the classroom when throwaway fashion was unimaginable and people had to make do and mend. But knitting, sewing and embroidery are making a comeback in design and technology lessons as children learn traditional home skills again. Knitting has not been widely taught for decades, but after one school found it had the knock-on effect of improving pupils' maths and behaviour, it is returning for boys and girls aged up to 14. Classroom comeback: Pupils (l-r) Tabitha and Betsy Forsyth at Worth Primary School's knitting club . At Worth Primary School, near Deal in Kent, teachers said it improved behaviour, helped pupils learn to write and encouraged them to have proper discussions with each other rather than play with their phones. They were so impressed with the impact of a lunchtime knitting club that they started incorporating it into other lessons. During maths lessons, pupils created a design then calculated the number of stitches they would need. In history, pupils learned about the clothing worn in the Middle Ages and how to make it. Changes: Teachers said knitting led to pupils putting down their phones and having proper discussions . Headmistress Lynne Moore said: 'It has dramatically improved behaviour, and it really helps communication. Instead of playing on their phones or computers, the children knit and talk to each other. They have proper conversations.' Teachers and parents are now being consulted on a planned shake-up of the national curriculum next year. The proposed curriculum states children will be taught 'to plan, design, make, repair and evaluate decorative and/or practical objects, using a range of textiles and employing common techniques such as sewing, embroidery and knitting'. But Caroline Wright, of the British Educational Suppliers Association, said yesterday: 'These proposals will result in some fabulous knitwear but, sadly, fewer world-class engineers and innovators.' Make Do And Mend was the title of an official booklet produced during the Second World War when wool was in short supply and women were urged to unpick old garments and reuse the wool. Knitting patterns were issued to the public to show them how to make winter clothes. After the war, girls learned knitting at school. Its popularity soared in the 1960s when people used new ranges of brightly coloured wool to emulate the latest fashions. But in the 1980s it went into decline as earnings went up and people could afford high street fashions. It was phased out of lessons completely with the introduction of the national curriculum in 1988. However there has been a revival thanks to the internet, with millions of people exchanging patterns online.","Teachers at Worth School, Kent, said it helped pupils learn to write .

Just hearing the word ‘web’ probably sends shivers down the spines of arachnophobia sufferers. But if they grin and bear the irony, it may be possible for them to overcome their phobia by logging onto it. That’s because there’s now an app available from iTunes called Phobia Free that’s designed to help people overcome arachnophobia - a fear of spiders. Creepy crawly confidence: The app claims that it can help you overcome your fear of spiders . It’s even been reviewed and approved by NHS England. Phobia Free, available on iPad and iPhone, helps to tackle people’s fear by exposing sufferers to more and more realistic spiders over time. The app uses a novel interactive method to achieve this through relaxation techniques and in-app gameplay while setting goals and tracking progress. Users of the app confront their fear by progressing from cute spiders all the way up to an augmented reality tarantula that looks and behaves like the real thing. ‘Having our app approved by the NHS is a tremendous endorsement of our work,’ said Dr Andres Fonseca, co-founder of Virtually Free, which made the programme. 'We believe this initiative by NHS England to give people access to quality assured apps and protect patients is very important. Smartphones and tablets have become integral tools in people accessing medical information and the large amount of information out there, can sometimes become overwhelming for people to access the help they need.' Arachnophobia is the acute fear of spiders and affects six per cent of the population. In extreme cases arachnophobia suffers may experience panic attacks as a result of their fear. It is one of the most common phobias to affect people in the UK and the world.

Police in North Carolina described the living conditions at the home where an 11-year-old boy was found handcuffed by his ankles to a post with a dead chicken around his neck as 'an environment you wouldn't want to walk through, much less live in.' As the 11-year-old and four other children aged between eight and 14-years-old were removed from the home of foster parents Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Lee Harper, Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said that the couple would also handcuff the children overnight to a three-foot piece of railroad to stop them running away. With Larson and Harper currently in jail on a bond or more than one million dollars, Cathey said the home had an overwhelming smell of urine and feces, no running water and revealed all the children slept on the floor in one room, 'As bad as you think that house was on the outside, that's probably the cleanest part of that place,' according to WCNC. Scroll Down for Video . Shocking conditions: Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Lee Harper were arrested Friday after a sheriff's deputy found the shivering 11-year-old boy . Wanda Sue Larson, a supervisor with the Union County Department of Social Services, and Dorian Lee Harper, an emergency room nurse at CMC-Union in Monroe, face charges of intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment, and cruelty to animals. 'It was filthy, feces on the floor, holes in the wall,' Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said to MyFox8.com. 'The bathroom, you could see from outside of the hall into the bathroom. Sink was trashed. No running water.' The conditions at the property shocked authorities who found dozens of chickens, turkeys, geese, two llamas and a horse roaming around the ramshackle home which was littered with junk. The chicken: Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Lee Harper were arrested after a foster child was found cuffed by the ankle to her front porch with a dead chicken hanging from around his neck . Cathey said that the smell inside the home took his breath away and that the children lived among dogs and feces. All the children appeared to suffering from malnutrition and Cathey said that the first thing law enforcement did for them was to buy them pizza. Wanda Sue Larson, 57, was arrested and charged with child abuse and false imprisonment on Friday after a deputy found the boy shivering and handcuffed by his ankle to the front porch, the Union County, North Carolina sheriff's office said. Larson, a supervisor at the county's Child Protective Services office, was not home when the child was discovered but is accused of being complicit in the mistreatment, according to sheriff's officials. Authorities also arrested Dorian Lee Harper, 57, who along with Larson was serving as a foster parent to the child. The couple has four adopted children in addition to the foster child. A deputy was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property when he saw the child handcuffed to the porch. Abuse: Wanda Sue Larson, who works as a supervisor for Child Protective Services, was arrested after deputies found a child handcuffed to her porch with a chicken around his neck . He approached the house and was confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for Harper's identification and an explanation as to why the child was handcuffed to the porch. According to WBTV, one of the children opened the front door, releasing several large dogs who attacked the deputy. By the time he had the dogs under control, Harper had removed the child from the porch and left the dead chicken on a barrel in front of the house. Other officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal investigation was opened. The children were removed from the home and are in the care of protective services outside of Union County. 'It's just shocking,' Captain Ronnie Whitaker said on Saturday. 'It's just disturbing that anyone would treat a child in such a manner.' Foster father: Dorian Harper was the parent at home when the child was found cuffed to the porch and was arrested on the spot . Disturbing: The child services worker lives at this property with four adopted children and one foster child . Both Larson and Harper were charged with intentional child abuse inflicting serious injury, false imprisonment, and cruelty to animals due to the condition of some of their pets. It is unclear what prompted the use of the dead chicken and handcuffs on the boy. Whitaker said he could not disclose details from police interviews conducted as part of the investigation. Larson and Harper remained jailed on Saturday. They each face charges of intentional child abuse that inflicted serious injury, false imprisonment and cruelty to animals, with the latter allegation based on the condition of some of the family pets, the sheriff's office said. Larson also is charged with willful failure to discharge her duty as a public official and both are due in court on Monday.","Wanda Sue Larson and Dorian Lee Harper have been charged with multiple counts of child abuse and imprisonment .

So when he found a grubby old jug while underpinning a house on the island of Lindisfarne, he just threw it in the back of his van without a second thought. It was eight years later when he stumbled across it again in his father’s basement where he’d left it and decided to clean it. Rare: The collection of 10 gold and seven silver coins from the 1440s to the 1560s, pictured with a 15th century German Bartmann jug . Chance find: Richard Mason (right) with the jug and his father Tom (left) When he tipped it up, to his amazement out fell a pile of gold and silver coins - including one stamped with Pope Clement VII, who famously refused to annul the marriage of Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon in the 1520s. The coin, called a scudo, comes from Ancona in central Italy and is believed to be possibly only the second of its kind discovered anywhere in the world. It is so rare that experts Mr Mason contacted in Italy are only aware of one other coin like it having been sold in the last two decades. Together, the collection of 10 gold and seven silver coins from the 1440s to the 1560s could be worth tens of thousands in total, but the rarity of the scudo means putting an exact price on them has so far been impossible. Geographical spread: The coins are from Italy, Saxony and France . The coins found are said to come from across Europe and date back to the 16th Century.One of them is said to be a gold scudo, a coin made in Italy in the 1500s. The scudo originates from Ancona, in central Italy, and is stamped with the sign of Pope Clement VII, who famously refused to annul the marriage of Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon in 1527. It is believed to be the first coin of its type discovered anywhere in the world.Another of the coins has been identified as a silver thaler, a coin made Germany during the 1500s. The thaler was eventually adopted by the early American colonies and later become known as the dollar. Mr Mason, 38, of Rothbury, Northumberland, found the ceramic jug in 2003. After stumbling upon the coins in 2011, he took his find to show a local archaeologist who then reported the find to the British Museum. An inquest in Northumberland recently determined that the find was ‘treasure trove’. The case is currently being considered by the government’s Treasure Valuation Committee, which will put a value on the coins on December 5. The Great North Museum at Hancock is hoping to raise the money to acquire them once they are valued. The funds are likely to be shared between Mr Mason and the unnamed owner of the land where the jug was found. On Wednesday Mr Mason, who runs a construction firm with his father, said the house they were working on when they found the jug was built in 1962, but stood on top of the remains of a 14th century building. Builder Richard Mason said he was 'tickled pink' by the discovery of the coins, which are currently being valued by the government's Treasure Valuation Committee . He said: ‘I was hand digging around a pipe and I heard a clunk. I thought ""that’s strange"" so I dug around it and exposed a little jug. I pulled the jug out, it was covered in mud and clarts. ‘I had a quick look inside it appeared empty. I chucked it in the back of the van. Only recently, did I think it was worth giving the jug a little spring clean. I couldn’t believe it when all this gold and silver dropped out. ‘I’m absolutely tickled pink. Discovering something this rare doesn’t happen every day. I’ve never really found anything of any value of significance before.’ The collection of coins is currently being held by the British Museum. Ian Richardson, treasure registrar at the British Museum said: ‘These coins were probably savings that were built up over a number of years and buried to keep them safe. ‘There are coins from Italy, Saxony and France. Foreign coins could be used in this country much more easily in the 16th century. ‘We don’t know who owned the coins. But for whatever reason, it seems they weren’t able to come back and collect them. Lindisfarne lies off the north-east coast of England . ‘They may have forgotten where they buried them or they may have met with an untimely end. It’s rare to get a complete vessel like this full of coins. It’s an unusual find.’ One coin has been identified as a silver thaler, a coin made in Germany in the 1500s. The thaler was eventually adopted by the early American colonies and later become known as the dollar. Mr Mason said: ‘Lindisfarne, or Holy Island as we call it up here, was a well-used naval base in the 16th Century. It’s not impossible that coins from all over Europe will have landed there.’ In 1963, Alan Short, from Seahouses, found a pile of Elizabethan silver coins in almost the same spot on Holy Island. Those 50 coins are now housed at The Hancock Museum, in Newcastle.","Some of the coins are so rare that it's been impossible to value them .

The married couple found dead at their Massachusetts home along with their twin boys have been named as Scott Jones and Mei Kum Jones, both 43, and relatives have said that they were in the middle of a 'nasty divorce'. The couple, who lived on a quiet street in Arlington with their sons, Colt and Cameron- who would have celebrated their first birthday on November 26th- were discovered on Monday afternoon and police sources said they appear to have been killed with 'some kind of cutting tool.' The Arlington Chief of Police added that there is no risk to the public safety and that police aren't looking for a suspect. They were called to the scene by another tenant in the building who requested a well-being check. It has now been revealed that police had previously been called to the home on two different occasions before the twins were born last year. Mei Kum Jones and her twin sons Colt and Cameron (pictured) were found dead at home along with her husband and the boys father Scott Jones today in Arlington, Massachusetts . In the summer of 2010, they were called to the Arlington home after Scott Jones threatened to kill himself. The Boston Herald reports that the reason for the second call has not been revealed. The Middlesex District Attorney told The Boston Globe that the deaths were 'very troubling, very tragic situation,' but they would not reveal any further details about the crime scene except to say that the family died violently. Neighbors described Mrs Jones as attentive to her children while Mr Jones has been portrayed as obsessed with home improvement projects, as some people saw him pull up flowers that he had just planted before replacing them all over again. 'There were signs of trouble,' said Clare MacFarlane, whose mother is the Jones' next door neighbor. 'He’s just busy — busy, busy, busy, busy. Always fixing something, doing something, digging. He was always working on the house. 'I’m horrified. I’m horrified. Those poor babies.' Investigation: Police dress in booties to enter the crime scene where the bodies of two adults and two young children were found this afternoon in Arlington, Massachusetts . Unidentified: The district attorney still hasn't identified the bodies, as they wait to contact the deceased's next of kin . No suspect: In a press conference this afternoon, the chief of police said that they are currently not looking for a suspect in the case and that neighbors need not worry about public safety . She also told The Herald that Mr Jones had a son and daughter, ages 10 and 12 respectively, from an earlier marriage. Mrs Jones' own brother old local station WBZ-TV that the couple was in the process of splitting up. 'I think he just moved out a couple of days ago, and I think she's going through the motion of the divorce,' Ben Li said. 'Arlington victim's brother tells me his sister was great person, loving mom. He is horrified at what's happened,' Kate Merrill tweeted. She had been previously married for four years from 2000 to 2004 and her ex husband, who has not been named, spoke to The Globe about how he was shocked at the news. 'She was a very sweet, wonderful person. I can't imagine anyone wanting to do her any harm,' the man told the paper. Mrs Jones worked at a travel and education not-for-profit organization called Road Scholar and graduated from Bentley University which is near Arlington. Tragedy in the suburbs: The bodies were found in Arlington, Massachusetts, a suburb about twenty minutes northwest of Boston . 'Mei was a valued member of our team, and her loss is deeply felt by all of us,' Road Scholar said in a statement. 'As we grieve together, we can only imagine the impossible loss Mei’s family must bear, and our deepest sympathies are with them.' The bodies were found at 45 Newland Road in Arlington, off Summer Street near Peirce Elementary School. Neighbors said that they didn't hear any gunshots last night. A neighbor told WHDH that a couple lived in the bottom apartment where the bodies were found, and that they had twin boys under a year old. The neighbor said that the woman had purchased the condo about five years ago before getting married to her husband three years ago. The tenants of the upper apartments were seen speaking with police outside the house before putting their own small child in their Subaru and driving off.

Tourism chiefs have admitted for the first time that wind farms could drive holidaymakers away. In an intervention likely to embarrass the Scottish Government, VisitScotland has said an application to put turbines on a site north of Dumfries could have a ‘detrimental effect’ on tourism. Its statement comes after Alex Salmond claimed wind farms ‘enhance our appeal as a country’ and puts the Scottish Government-funded quango on a collision course with its paymasters. 'Detrimental': Scotland is already home to as many as 2,700 wind turbines . It has been welcomed, however, by critics, who want a moratorium on turbine applications. Murdo Fraser, Tory convener of the Holyrood energy and tourism committee, said: ‘This is a significant development in the fight against the SNP’s wind farm obsession. If wind farms will damage tourism in one area of Scotland, this is surely the case the country over.’ There are as many as 2,700 turbines north of the Border and seven applications a day are made to councils to erect more. Wind farm developers can cash in on £400million in subsidies paid in Britain every year – huge payments which have been cut by only 10 per cent by the Scottish Government in its drive to provide 100 per cent of electricity through renewable energy by 2020. First Minister: Alex Salmond has said wind farms benefit Scotland, claiming they 'enhance our appeal as a country' Opponents have warned that if every planned turbine goes ahead, there could be more than 5,000 turbines blanketing Scotland. With many of these sited in the Highlands and islands, it is feared they could damage the country’s £11billion-a-year tourism trade. VisitScotland says it does not oppose wind farms in principle and earlier this year it published a survey which concluded four out of five tourists would not be put off visiting Scotland by the turbines. However, it has admitted that a ten-turbine wind farm at Minnygap, Dumfriesshire, could hurt tourism. The turbines would stand on part of the Southern Upland Way – a 212-mile coast-to-coast route between Portpatrick, Wigtownshire, and Cockburnspath, Berwickshire – which is popular with hikers, horse-riders and cyclists. In a planning committee report to be presented to Dumfries and Galloway Council on Thursday, VisitScotland says ‘the proposed development appears to be visible from the Southern Upland Way, which is an important part of the tourism offering in the area. ‘There have been a number of applications for wind farm developments along the route of the walk. Should all of these be granted, there could be a cumulative detrimental effect on walkers.’ David Gibson, of the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, said: ‘This intervention was long overdue. I hope the Scottish Government sits up and takes notice.’ Picturesque: The turbines would stand on part of Scotland's Southern Upland Way, a coast to coast route popular with hikers, cyclists and horse riders . Beauty spot: A walker admires the view from part of the Southern Upland Way at Galloway, Scotland . A VisitScotland spokesman said: ‘When consulted as part of the formal planning process, VisitScotland recommends tourism concerns are taken into account when granting planning permission.’ Dumfries and Galloway Council is recommending the application be refused on the grounds that it will interfere with nuclear detectors at Eskdalemuir weather station. A Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘VisitScotland’s own research backs up previous studies – the majority of tourists are not deterred by wind turbines. In fact, evidence shows that wind turbines can attract tourists.’","VisitScotland has said plans to build turbines at Minnygap, Dumfriesshire could hurt tourism in the area .

A seven-year-old Florida boy and his father claims to have been hit in the head by fragments of a meteorite that fell from the sky at the weekend. Steven Lippard was playing in the driveway of his home in Loxahatchee, a suburb west of Delray Beach, on Saturday when he was struck in the head by a hard object. His father, Wayne Lippard, found his son on his back bleeding from the scalp, reports CBS 12. Close encounters: Steven Lippard, 7, from Loxahatchee, Florida, claims to have been hit by fragments of a meteorite while playing outside his home . Ouch: Whatever hit Steven Lippard in the head - scientists are examining the rocks found nearby - left a nasty cut, which required three staples . Examining the evidence: These are some of the fragments found on the driveway where Steven Lippard was struck in the head. Researchers at Florida Atlantic University determined that met the criteria of that of a meteor . The resultant cut required three staples to be stitched up. 'At first I thought it was a golf ball or maybe a bird of prey,' dad Wayne told CBS12 News. However a search of the driveway produced pieces of a strange rock. Wayne bagged up the interesting minerals and took them to Florida Atlantic University. Researchers soon discovered the rocks met the scientific criteria of a meteorite. A demonstration showed that, despite their small size - less than that of a pea - the pebbles were still highly magnetic. Proof? Wayne Lippard demonstrates how, using a metal detector, the minerals they found are magnetic . A chemical test will now prove definitively whether the rocks are from space. Astronomer Phil Plait said it was almost impossible to calculate the odds of a meteorite striking a human. Just two Americans have had encounters with them in recent times. A fragment weighed eight pounds hit an Alabama in 1954. After the accident: Wayne Lippard took this photo of his son after finding him bleeding from the head on Saturday . Wayne Lippard (right) with son Steven discusses during a TV news interview what he believes happened during the accident on Saturday . Then a 27-pound rock crushed a car in New York in 1992.

Shoppers are more likely to buy a product advertised from an online classified advert if they think the seller is white, a new study suggests. A year-long experiment examining the sales of iPods on Craigslist in the U.S. revealed racial bias as black sellers did worse than their white counterparts . The research showed that black sellers got fewer responses and lower offers for their iPods, while shoppers were also less attracted to white sellers with tattoos on their wrists. The research showed that black sellers got fewer responses and lower offers for their iPods, while shoppers were also less attracted to white sellers with tattoos on their wrists. The researchers posted similar photos of the devices being held by white and black men . U.S. researchers posted 1,200 classified adverts in over 300 areas of the U.S. between March 2009 and March 2010, to test for racial bias among buyers by featuring similar photos of the iPod held by a man’s hand that was wither black, white or white with a wrist tattoo. The experiment found black sellers receive 13 per cent fewer responses, 18 per cent fewer offers and the money offered was 12 per cent lower than that offered to a white seller. White sellers with wrist tattoos were found to have similar responses and offers. In the study, published in the Economic Journal of the Royal Economic Society, buyers interacting with black sellers behaved in ways that suggested they trusted them less. They were 17 per cent less likely to include their names, 44 per cent likely to agree to a proposed delivery by mail and 56 per cent more likely to express concern about making a long distance payment. Professor Jennifer Doleac, assistant professor of public policy and economics at Virginia University, said: ‘We were really struck to find as much racial discrimination as we did.’ In the study, buyers interacting with black sellers behaved in ways that suggested they trusted them less. They were 17 per cent less likely to include their names, 44 per cent likely to agree to a proposed delivery by mail and 56 per cent more likely to express concern about making a long distance payment . She conducted the study with Luke C.D. Stein, assistant professor of finance at Arizona State University, when they were both doctoral students in economics at Stanford University. The researchers placed their adverts among over 300 local classified ad websites with an average of 15.7 other adverts for iPod Nanos listed the previous week. In more crowded markets, with over 20 iPod adverts, black sellers received the same number of offers and equal best offers relative to white sellers. But black sellers suffered ‘particularly poor’ outcomes in markets with fewer products on sale, where they received 23 per cent fewer offers and best offers were 12 per cent lower. The news comes after a recent study that found a person's race is still a major factor when picking a partner. Research examining the preferences of a dating app found black men and women receive fewer responses to their messages (graphic of results, pictured) The study also found that black sellers do worst in markets with high property crime rates and more racially segregated housing, suggesting that at least part of the explanation is ‘statistical discrimination’ - where race is used as a proxy for unobservable negative characteristics – rather than simply ‘taste-based’ discrimination, Professor Doleac explained. However, ‘it is also possible that bias against black sellers is higher in high-crime or high-isolation markets,’ she said. The researchers also found evidence that black sellers do better in markets with larger black populations, ‘suggesting that the disparities may be driven, in part, by buyers’ preference for own-race sellers,’ according to the study. ‘We believe our study isolates the effect of race on market outcomes more convincingly than previous studies and provides some insight into why buyers are discriminating,’ Professor Doleac said. The news comes after a recent study that found a person’s race is still a major factor when picking a partner. Research examining the preferences of Facebook dating app, Are You Interested (AYI) found black men and women receive fewer responses to their messages. It also found that men from all different races prefer a partner of another race over their own.racial dating . The study found men respond to women around there times more often than women reply to men's messages and that the women studied were mostly drawn to white men . The data comes from AYI, which claims to be one of the largest Facebook dating apps with over 70 million users and is similar to Tinder.","A yearlong experiment by U.S.researchers examining the sales of iPods on Craigslist in the U.S. revealed racial bias .

A Florida woman has accused a pair of stray pit bulls of eating through one of her car’s side panels. Gail Beckwith, of Lauderhill, said the dogs were after a cat hiding in the right front wheel well on her Toyota Yaris. They tried to chew through the car earlier this week to get to the frightened feline. ’This is crazy, never ever in my life have I ever seen anything like this,’ the shocked woman told Local 10. ‘They bit right through the car.’ Dogs gone wild: Two pit bulls are believed to have chewed through this car panel to get to a cat cowering in the wheel well . The red coupe suffered significant damage in the incident. The panel, bumper and hood are being held together with string. ‘I see the car all torn up and I was like ‘what the hell?’ She recalled to the station.‘They bit right through the car,’ she later added. Ms Beckwith told the station that a pair of roaming pit bulls attacked the car. She produced a part of the car riddled with teeth marks from the vicious dogs. ‘They always travel in two, they’re never alone,’ the woman added, describing one of the dogs as brown and the other as off-white with spots. Riddled with bite marks: An up-close view of the car shows bite marks and scratches from the brutal beasts' powerful paws . Vicious: Pit bulls are feared by many people despite normally being harmless to humans . She believes the two beasts were after a cat that ran for its life and cowered in the wheel well as the dogs launched their brutal assault on the innocent vehicle. ‘The cat was resting here,’ Ms Beckwith told the station while pointing to the damaged area. ‘That's why they started pulling this off, so that they could get to the cat.’ The dogs are not believed to have attacked any people, but the worried woman fears for the safety of children in the area. ‘If they can do this to a car, imagine what they can do to kids, and there's two schools in the area,’ she said. Proof: Bite marks can be seen on this part, which fell off the inner part of the wheel well . Severely damaged: Even the front bumper was a casualty of the menacing mongrels . Neighbors shared her concern. ‘It really does worry me,’ an unidentified person said while gesturing to his young daughter standing next to him. ‘She could be dead now.’ ‘That’s very scary,’ said another. Local animal control officials told Local 10 that there have been no reports of animals reported running wild through the city, but have cautioned locals to be careful in the event they cross paths with the blood-thirsty canines.","A Florida woman said two pit bulls ate through a panel on her car .

It is a truly hair-raising idea - a wig that can monitor your health, give you directions, and even change its shape. The bizarre patent for a 'wearable computing device, comprising a wig that is adapted to cover at least a part of a head of a user' has been filed by electronics giant Sony. The U.S. patent describes a terrifying-sounding device called a SmartWig, which is packed with sensors and special devices that vibrate on the user’s head to give them messages such as driving directions. The bizarre patent for a 'wearable computing device, comprising a wig that is adapted to cover at least a part of a head of a user,' has been filed by electronics giant Sony. It has a circuit board hidden under the hair and can talk to a second device - such as a phone . The application describes a standard wig that could ‘be made from horse hair, human hair, wool, feathers, yak hair or any kind of synthetic material.’ However, the wig could also include special fibres that move, changing its shape. It has a circuit board hidden under the hair and can talk to a second device - such as a phone. ‘The user can wear the wearable computing device as a regular wig while looking natural at the same time,’ the says. Wearers of the wig can give presentations wearing it and switched slides by tapping their sideburns, under which buttons are hidden. They may not be as impressive as Bradley Wiggins' sideburns, who is pictured here after winning the 2012 Tour de France . It vibrates on a user's head to give them messages, such as driving directions. People can wear it to give presentations by tapping their sideburns. It also has a laser pointer built in for presentations. A built-in GPS chip could monitor the area around the wearer to make sure they don't bump into things. The wig could include special fibres that move to change its shape. They could be worn by couples who want to make each other's hairpieces vibrate. Sony has already tested the wig with employees who gave presentations wearing it and switched slides by tapping their sideburns. 'One or two switch buttons may be provided under the sideburns of the wig, and the one or more buttons are connected to the external computer via a wireless connection (using the Wi-Fi module),' Sony’s documents reveal. The SmartWig also has a GPS chip built in and ultrasound sensors that could monitor the area around the wearer to make sure they don’t walk into things. 'During a presentation the user may, for example, move forward or backward through presentation slides by simply pushing the sideburns. Thus, the user can control the presentation slides simply by natural behaviour like touching side burns.' The SmartWig also has a GPS chip built in and ultrasound sensors that could monitor the area around the wearer to make sure they don't walk into things . The SmartWig also has a built in laser pointer for presentations. ‘The laser pointer may, for example, be arranged on a forehead part of the wig, so that the user may point out relevant information on the projected slide in the above-explained presentation mode.’ Sony even says the wigs could be worn by couples. 'If one user touches one of his/her vibration motors, the other users equivalent motor may vibrate,' the patent says. As tech giants try to out-do each other by patenting cyborg-like technologies, Motorola has recently filed a patent for a 'tattoo,' which would be placed onto a person's throat and pick sounds created by their voice. If the user is making a phone call, the tattoo would then send these sounds wirelessly to the smartphone and the caller. The patent is called ‘Coupling an electronic skin tattoo to a mobile communication device’ and was originally filed in May last year. Throughout the patent, Motorola calls the device ‘electronic tattoo 110’ and said it would ‘comprise audio circuitry that enables reception of acoustic signals from a person's throat’. Put simply, the tattoo’s built-in microphone could pick up the sounds made by a person’s voice by reading vibrations and fluctuations of muscle or tissue from their voicebox. It continues that the tattoo would either contain a battery that ‘may or may not be rechargeable’, or alternatively, could be powered by an NFC or Bluetooth charging device.","Sony has filed a patent for a SmartWig packed with sensors and special devices that vibrate on the user’s head to give them messages .

The man who testified against A-Rod during the New York Yankee player's suspension appeal has been pictured with a suspicious white powder. In a photo released by the New York Post, Biogenesis founder Anthony Bosch is pictured at a table that has two bags of unidentified white powder on it. The credibility of Mr Bosch is central to the fate of A-Rod, also known as Alex Rodriguez, as he fights against his 211-game suspension. Hearing: Alex Rodriguez arrives at the MLB's New York headquarters to appeal his suspension last week . The Major League Baseball player is believed to have acquired an affidavit from Robert Davis Miller that claims Mr Bosch used cocaine 'on almost a daily basis, but at least many times per week and month'. Claims: Biogenesis founder Anthony Bosch allegedly took cocaine . According to the affidavit, seen by the New York Post, Mr Bosch's drug use took place from the summer of 2012 to the spring of this year. During arbitration A-Rod's legal team questioned Mr Bosch about his cocaine use, but attorneys for the MLB objected to the line of questioning, according to NBC Sports. Mr Bosch's credibility as a witness is central to the case, which comes down to accusations against A-Rod and his explanation of Biogenesis documents which purport to show the baseball player's PED use. The New York Yankees' player was suspended in August for alleged violations of the sport's drug agreement and labor contract, and he played pending a determination of the grievance. The legal team representing A-Rod didn't call Mr Miller as a witness, so the affidavit will only be used if A-Rod launches a lawsuit against the MLB. It is alleged that during his testimony, given over five days at the appeal hearing, Mr Bosch had text messages and emails to support his claim that he sold performance-enhancing drugs to A-Rod. Out of action: New York Yankees player A-Rod was suspended for 211 games . Appeal date: A-Rod at the MLB suspension hearing. A ruling is expected in January . As well as claiming that Mr Bosch used cocaine, Mr Miller has also alleged that the Biogenesis founder said he was being paid $5 million by the MLB. Mr Bosch has denied receiving any payments for his cooperation in the case, as has the MLB. A ruling on A-Rod's appeal is expected in January.","Biogenesis founder who testified at hearing accused of being drug user .

The leader of a U.S. Army small-kill team has been charged with two counts of murder for allegedly killing two deaf, unarmed Iraqi boys in a small Iraqi village in March of 2007. Former Staff Sergeant Michael Barbera has been charged by military prosecutors in the fatal shootings of  Ahmad Khalid al-Timmimi, 15, and his brother Abbas, 14, as the boys were tending cattle in a palm grove just outside As Sadah, about 50 miles northeast of Baghdad. Additionally, the 31-year-old Barbera 'lying to his commanders, directing fellow soldiers to lie to military . investigators and making a threatening phone call to a civilian in an . effort to keep what happened from becoming public,' according to a report from the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Killer: Authorities say Sergeant Michael Barbera fatally shot two unarmed, deaf Iraqi boys in 2007 . Barbera led Charlie Troop, 5th Squadron of the 73rd Airborne Reconnaissance Regiment out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. At the time of the alleged murders, the squadron was involved in counterinsurgency operations in the Diyala province. That's when military officials say Barbera fatally shot the two boys before lying to his superiors about how they died. 'None of us feel good about this. But I'm glad that the Army is . doing the right thing,' Ken Katter, 46, of Saginaw, Mich., the . sniper assigned to Barbera's team, told the paper. 'Leader': Barbera led a small-kill team in the Army's 73rd Airborne Reconnaissance Regiment when the alleged murders took place . Katter is one of several soldiers who brought the killings to the attention of Army officials. Katter firmly believes that the shootings led to two truck bomb attacks two weeks later that killed 10 soldiers. According to the Trib, investigators who reviewed the case recommended that Barbera be charged with two counts of murder. However, those charges never made it to an Article 32 hearing. Instead, the paper reports, Barbera received a light reprimand and ultimately promoted. However, whistle-blowers like Katter and others spoke up against their former superior officer. 'All we ever asked was for someone to listen to us and give what we were concerned about — a fair hearing,' Katter said. Barbera was charged on Wednesday at Alaska's Fort Richardson with two counts of murder. He currently is in the process of being moved to Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, where he will undergo a formal arraignment.","Sergeant Michael Barbera allegedly fatally shot the two boys as they tended cattle in a palm grove .

Speaker's wife Sally Bercow is not 'some kitchen table blogger' and her tweet about a Tory peer had a  major influence on him being falsely identified as a paedophile, a court heard yesterday. Her 60,000 Twitter followers gave her message a readership larger than many local newspapers, the High Court was told. Only a 'moron in a hurry' would have failed to understand that the comment she sent about Lord McAlpine referred to false claims that he had abused boys at a care home, it was alleged. Hearing: Sally Bercow (left), who is accused of sending an allegedly libellous tweet about Lord McAlpine (right), was not 'some kitchen table blogger' , the High Court was told today . Mrs Bercow has always denied that her . tweet on November 4 which said: 'Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *Innocent face*', defamed the former Tory party treasurer. It was sent in the wake of a BBC . Newsnight report that wrongly implicated a senior Tory from the Thatcher . era in child sex abuse allegations. Lord McAlpine was not named on the programme but was wrongly identified on the internet. Mrs Bercow's tweet fuelled the false . allegations that Lord McAlpine was a paedophile, Sir Edward Garnier, . for the peer, told the court. He said: 'We are not talking about . some kitchen table blogger addressing perhaps herself and one other . person. We are talking about a pretty widespread readership.' William McCormick QC, for Mrs Bercow – . the wife of Speaker John Bercow – said she had promptly tweeted her . apologies and provided letters making clear that the underlying . allegations were untrue. Legal action: Mrs Bercow used Twitter to name former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine, following a Newsnight report which alleged a senior Tory figure was a child abuser, but she denies this was defamatory . Couple: Mrs Bercow is married to Commons speaker John, who live together in their grace and favour flat at Westminster . She had also made an offer to settle the case which had not been withdrawn, he said. But Sir Edward said Lord McAlpine had . made three offers to settle the case, two in November and one in . January, which had been declined. Neither Lord McAlpine nor Mrs Bercow . were in court for the peer's contested application for the  defamation . trial to be split in two, with the first hearing deciding the meaning of . the tweet and, if that went in his favour, a second hearing on the . appropriate level of damages. Granting the application, Mr Justice . Tugendhat directed Mrs Bercow to pay Lord McAlpine's estimated £17,000 . costs of the preliminary hearing. Lord McAlpine has already received . six-figure payouts from the BBC and ITV. He has dropped claims against . Twitter users with fewer than 500 followers.

Women have never had such a huge choice of coat styles to wear. Plenty of choice for a woman looking to make a style statement, surely. But beware. Femail has identified the seven coat shapes dominating the shops this winter, and not all of them are flattering to your curves. Big coats dominate. While we women spend hours worrying about whether our jeans make our bottoms look big, or whether our blouses make our arms look chubby, we don't pay as much attention to our outerwear and that's a mistake. The wrong coat could make you look much larger. At first glance, these big beauties shrug on effortlessly over winter woollies and there'd be no trouble doing the buttons up after Christmas dinner. What's more, they keep you lovely and warm. At last, you might think, a fashion trend that works with, rather than against, the needs of real women. But slip them on, and their one disadvantage quickly becomes apparent: they really can make you look enormous. So how does a normal, size 12 woman solve this dilemma? LYDIA SLATER tried on seven of this season's must-have coats over the same little black dress to find out which winter coats slim you - and which pile on the pounds... Maroon mohair coat,  £200, topshop.comAn expensive coat which is properly lined, this feels luxurious, and I like the rich colour. In every other respect, it is hideous. The dropped sleeve makes my arms look short and fat, and gives me the shoulders of an American footballer. The cocoon shape curves out over my waist and stomach, and the fuzziness of the mohair fabric adds even more unwanted inches all over. Dress sizes gained: 4Verdict: I have the figure of a portly orangutan. 0/5 . Military coat, £279, HobbsThis coat is cleverly structured to make the most of feminine curves. The waist is nipped in by three rows of buttons, and the skirt flares out to skim gently over the hips, falling to just below the knee. The epaulettes add extra definition to the shoulder, giving an hourglass shape. It does nip around the arms a bit, but could slip over a bulky jumper fairly easily. I feel like a heroine in a black-and-white film. Dress sizes gained: 0Verdict: I feel so trim, and like it so much I've bought it myself for Christmas. 5/5 . KIMONO COAT - LOOKS LIKE A DRESSING GOWN . OVERCOAT - SWAMPED BY SWATHES OF PINK . Powder blue Danielle cape, £195, Coast This elegant cape feels glamorous and expensive, and hurray, it has a tie waist, so it's bound to be more flattering. Or so I thought before I put it on. But the bunched up, draped material doesn't flatter, the hem looks fussy and the abbreviated sleeves make my arms look short. This would make a lovely dressing gown, but it doesn't make me look remotely good enough to consider wearing outdoors. Dress sizes gained: 2Verdict: Surprisingly disappointing. 2/5 . Pink coat, £85, M&SSupposed to be one of the season's must-haves, but I’m disappointed. The wide rolled-up cuffs and dropped shoulder shorten my arms from both ends. I don't like the big, clumsy popper fastenings, but if I wear it done up, the straight shape is swamping. There's not a hint of waist in it. No wonder the model in the advert wears it casually slung over her shoulders to avoid the problem.Dress sizes gained: 1 Verdict: Don't believe the hype. 3/5 . COCOON COAT - DO I LOOK LIKE JACKIE O? NO! Cocoon coat, £450, JaegerThis has a soft, metallic shimmer and a loose, elegant shape with flared sleeves. I hope the effect will be rather Jackie O, but I look like I'm wearing overalls. It feels huge and I look as though I’ve put on at least a stone. It's made worse by the unnecessary patch pockets which add bulk and fussiness to the front. A useful party standby if worn open over a tight little dress, but at this price it ought to work harder than that. Dress sizes gained: 3Verdict: Lovely on the hanger, not so great on the body. 2/5 . Light grey Daisey coat, £279, HobbsA . boyfriend coat that looks elegant and understated on the hanger, but it . swamps me the moment I put it on. There’s acres of spare material under . the arms. The deep V-neck does show off some skin, but the on-the-knee . length means the coat isn’t very versatile — I can’t see it working well . with trousers. It’s relatively wearable, but it makes me look very . broad. Dress sizes gained: 2Verdict: A nice coat, but there’s too much bulk for my liking. 2/5 .

The holidays may be over, but a Louisiana woman wants to keep a light display on her roof extending a middle finger to her neighbors. U.S. District Judge James Brady heard testimony Monday about whether Sarah Childs should be granted a preliminary injunction, barring the city of Denham Springs and police from requiring her to remove the display. The judge didn't rule and the hearing will continue next week. Childs said she put up the roof message in November because she believed a neighbor stole her dog. She said police threatened her with fines and arrest because of the lights. She and the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana sued the city, its mayor and police. Christmas may be over, but Sarah Henderson wants to continue with her 'rude' lighting display to get her own back a neighbor . Henderson now says the display was a message to a neighbor who she believes stole her dog . Lawyers for Denham Springs and police say officials didn't threaten Childs and the case has no merit. But they also argue the display isn't protected speech under the U.S. Constitution because the extended finger is designed to attack her neighbor. The judge issued a temporary restraining order in mid-December, prohibiting city officials from interfering with the lights and saying efforts to take down the display would violate her rights to free speech and due process. With the Christmas holidays wrapped up and many people packing up their holiday lights, the federal judge asked Monday if the lawsuit still was needed. 'Is this matter now moot? Are the lights still up?' he asked. 'The lights are still up,' said Justin Harrison, an ACLU lawyer representing Childs. 'And she intends to keep them up?' Brady asked. 'I think she intends to keep them up, your honor,' Harrison replied. Henderson has twice removed the lights from her roof, but with the support of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana she is attempting to sue the city, its mayor and police . According to the lawsuit, Childs removed the lights twice: once after a police officer told her she could be fined and again after another officer threatened to arrest her. But she has reinstalled them, after getting representation from the ACLU and the judge's temporary order in her favor. In Monday's testimony, Denham Springs police officer Jared Kreamer described two visits to Childs' home in response to complaints from Childs that her neighbors were harassing her. Under initial questioning from Childs' lawyer, Kreamer said he didn't recall if he told her to take down the light display or told her she could go to jail because of it. He said he found the lights offensive and thought it could be considered disturbing the peace. 'I remember telling her if she didn't take it down, it could lead to trouble,' the police officer said. Then, Childs' lawyers played a partial recording that Childs had made with her cell phone during one conversation with Kreamer in which he told her she could end up in jail because of the lights. Kreamer said he wasn't threatening her, but was just advising her that she could run into a complaint by her neighbors accusing of her disturbing the peace.","Mother of four Sarah Childs designed her Christmas lights to send a 'rude' message to neighbors she has been warring with for a year .

But a snowstorm and very high winds left them largely confined to their rooms.

Speaking . to Sky News, the prince revealed that his brother - who has been . concentrating on his responsibilities as a new father - was envious of . the ambitious trek. Harry said: ‘My brother, yeah, I think he's just quite jealous that I managed to get away from a screaming child.’ He . said the Queen and Prince Philip had taken the time to meet his .

TV presenter Trinny Woodall has revealed her battle with cocaine addiction – and fears her young daughter may follow in her footsteps. The fashion guru and socialite, who is now dating Charles Saatchi, told how the drug and alcohol turned her into a ‘fake, lying, thieving, cheating person’. Speaking at a recent debate on substance abuse, she said both she and former husband Johnny Elichaoff – a financial consultant who turned to prescription drugs – suffered from the ‘disease of addiction’ during their ten-year marriage. Close: Charles Saatchi with his dinner date Trinny Woodall on Monday, who today wrote that cocaine and alcohol turned her into a 'fake, lying, thieving, cheating person' But she now worries that ten-year-old daughter Lyla could follow the same path. ‘It makes me question what I can do for my daughter,’ she said. ‘Her mother and her father both suffer from the disease of addiction. So what are her chances? ‘She could grow up and be perfect. I do believe it’s in her. I see elements in her behaviour that are addictive with things. I want to make sure she is nurtured, a nurtured human being.’ Divorce: Nigella Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi, 70, are both set to give prosecution evidence against their two former PAs this week, in a case where Mr Saatchi described his wife as 'Higella' The former What Not To Wear presenter, who has been sober for 23 years, began drinking and taking drugs at 16 after moving from boarding school to a day school in London. She said she was a shy teenager who was insecure about her looks as she suffered from ‘chronic acne’. Past: Trinny (pictured in 1982) admitted to taking cocaine because she 'wanted to be cool' and going into rehab after an overdose . Watched by 70-year-old multi-millionaire art collector Mr Saatchi as she took part in the debate, she said: ‘My parents were still abroad and I lived with a sister who was four years older and she had glamorous friends and I so desperately wanted to fit in. ‘One evening I was presented with cocaine and I wanted to take it. 'I had very long hair and I swept down and split five grams of cocaine on the floor and everybody was p****d off with me but I took it. ‘I thought, “I have got to have some bravado here”. I remember that I suddenly had this confidence and I had lacked it until then enormously. 'It was fun for three or four years. I did it at weekends and my friends did it, it was a right of passage.’ But a few years later it became to be ‘a bit of a problem’. ‘My family thought my personality had changed and I remember sitting at the dining room table and I thought I would cop it,’ she added. ‘I told my parents I took drugs and they were horrified. My father said to me, “Well now you have told me, you can stop” and my brother said, “I don’t think it is going to be that simple”. Miss Woodall described how she ‘stopped for a few weeks’ before starting again. A few months later she overdosed. After waking up in hospital, her mother drove her straight to rehab – but she was thrown out after showing a pornographic film. Soon, her addiction started again. In her 20s she developed a second addiction, this time to alcohol. ‘I had a bottle of vodka a night and I took cocaine and I started to get into trouble,’ she said. ‘It ended in me losing jobs which I pretended were better than they were and I ended up feeling lonely and isolated.’ At the debate, organised by The Spectator magazine, Miss Woodall spoke against the motion that ‘Addiction Is Not A Disease’. Drugs past: Trinny Woodall pictured yesterday on her bike in London . She claimed ‘it is second nature’ that addiction is a disease. ‘I have a healthy life today by knowing that.’ In an article written for the magazine, Miss Woodall revealed how alcohol and cocaine turned her into a ‘fake, lying, thieving, cheating person’. She finally took steps to conquer her problems when she was 26, leaving London to spend seven months in a primary care centre and half a year in a half-way house in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. She filled the hole left by drink and drugs by throwing herself into her career, and later fulfilled her desire to have a child after 11 rounds of IVF. Miss Woodall, whose TV show finished in 2008, is now back in the limelight following her relationship with Mr Saatchi following the end of his ten-year marriage to Nigella Lawson this summer. But she will always be an addict in recovery. ‘It is like a diabetic with insulin,’ she said. ‘If they stop taking it, they will die. And I believe, a day at a time, that if I stop taking the primary drugs that can kill me at some stage my life will progress and I will have a greater chance of not living that life.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Star admits in Spectator she was an alcoholic and took cocaine .

The captain of the Bloomfield High School football team has been charged with the murder of a 27-year-old man with whom he had allegedly been having a sexual relationship. Tarence Mitchell, 18, of Bloomfield, is accused of stabbing Ronald Taylor Jr five times in the torso and leaving the knife in his back after trying to break off the two-year relationship. The incident took place Thursday night in the front yard of Mitchell's home at 24 Hill Farm Road on Thursday night. According to court documents, the murder weapon was a steak knife. Tarence Mitchell, a star Connecticut high school football player, was trying to break it off with his older lover when he stabbed the man to death during a tussle outside the teen's home, cops say . Scene: The fight between Tarence Mitchell and his alleged lover Ronald Taylor Jr occurred out front of Mitchell's home at Hill Farm Rd, Bloomfield . Tarence Mitchell was arrested Thursday and, according to police, has confessed to stabbing his lover, Ronal Taylor Jr . NBC Connecticut reports that Mitchell armed himself after Taylor arranged a meeting between the two, promising it 'wasn't going to end well'. Police responded to a call at 9:13 p.m. after receiving reports of two men fighting and found two people suffering from stab wounds. An ambulance transported Ronald Taylor Jr., 27, of Bloomfield, to Saint Francis Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. According to court documents, Mitchell first lied to police about the stabbing, claiming both he and Taylor were attacked by two men. He changed his story during an interview with police and admitted to stabbing Taylor five times, according to court documents. 'He¿s never been in trouble. He¿s a star athlete, he¿s loved all around town, everybody knows him. This is just so shocking. I send my deepest condolences to the victim¿s family but my son is not a murderer': Mitchell's mother, Tyra Smith, says her son is innocent . Neighbors in the Bloomfield street reported hearing noises of running and 'two boys fighting' Mitchell is being held in jail on a $1 million bond.The youngster doesn't suffer from any mental illness, the court heard, but 'he's extremely confused and upset' about Taylor's murder. According to the documents, Mitchell - a star football player described as a 'great kid' - told officers that he and Taylor were in a sexual relationship but that he had tried to distance himself from Taylor. He said that three weeks ago, Taylor had posted a photo of Mitchell on Facebook, calling him 'Bloomfield gay football player'. Mitchell told police that Taylor took it down but threatened to post the photo again if Mitchell tried to distance himself again. On his Facebook page, Mitchell is listed as 'interested in women'. Mitchell told officers that Taylor had threatened him with a sword in the past and would get jealous when he texted girls, according to court documents. Taylor texted Mitchell on Thursday saying he was coming over and that it 'wasn't going to end well', Mitchell told investigators. Mitchell told police that he armed himself with a knife and stabbed Taylor after Taylor punched him in the face. Tarence Mitchell is a star footballer who is described as 'a great kid' who is 'loved by all the town' Police claim Taylor tried to run away, but Mitchell chased him and stabbed him again, including once in the back. Police set bond initially at $500,000. Mitchell has no arrest history, and his lawyer asked for a lower amount, but the judge set bond at $1 million. He appeared in court Friday, and his lawyer said he is 'extremely confused and upset' by the death of Taylor. Mitchell's mother, Tyra Smith, defended her son, saying 'he's never been in trouble'.

Global vision: Tim Steiner, chief executive of Ocado, said the comapny has held talks with global retailers . Ocado has held talks to expand abroad and transform itself into the next big star of the technology industry. The retailer, which has been described as the Amazon of food for its cutting-edge warehousing and delivery system, is in talks to license its know-how around the world. Shares in the Hatfield-based firm, which was started by three former Goldman Sachs bankers 13 years ago, soared 32 per cent as it announced its first new contract since signing a deal with Waitrose in 2000. In a move that could transform its fortunes, Ocado has signed a 25-year distribution contract with Morrisons which it will operate in tandem with Waitrose. Ocado will provide systems that will become the backbone for the online debut of Britain’s fourth largest grocer. Morrisons will pay to use Ocado’s hi-tech warehouse and delivery system to distribute its products. The chain is fighting to catch up with rivals including Tesco and Asda, who have sold groceries over the internet for years. Ocado chief executive Tim Steiner told the Mail he think grocers will move from developing their own expensive systems to renting communal versions. He said the Morrisons move is the start of growing the Ocado business into new areas. ‘We have held talks with global retailers who are interested in our systems,’ said Mr Steiner. ‘Wherever you go around the globe experts say the most advanced retail system has been created by Ocado. Businesses from Asia, North America, Europe and Australasia have come to talk to us. They don’t need to reinvent what we’ve done already.’ Ocado, which has still to turn a profit, has created an automated warehouse filled with robots and conveyor belts and owns the software that powers it. It also has sophisticated technology that routes its vans around the country to avoid peak traffic and road works so that deliveries arrive in time for specific hour slots. Expanding: Ocado has created an automated warehouse filled with robots and conveyor belts and owns the software that powers it . Ocado’s systems have been compared to American technology giant Amazon, which also uses state-of-the-art technology to cut costs and deliver books and other mainly non-food items efficiently. It too rents out its platform to third parties and provides the backbone for Marks & Spencer’s website. Mr Steiner said: ‘There are many different ways we could utilise our intellectual property. ‘We could just sell it under licence, form a joint venture, or operate our own system in a new territory ourselves.’ Ocado was founded by Mr Steiner, Jason Gissing and Jonathan Faiman in April 2000 and by October had entered into the branding and sourcing arrangement with Waitrose. It started commercial delivery service in January 2002, operating initially in St Albans and Hemel Hempstead. By May 2005 its delivery area expanded to cover more than 10million households. Unlike rivals, it hires computer experts to work in-house, rather than buy in existing programmes. Projects listed on its website include robots with 3D vision and intelligent machines that can adapt quickly to follow fast-changing instructions. ‘We are continuing to invest millions in our state of the art technology, and to develop software systems and algorithms to solve an array of complex problems,’ the company says on a website dedicated entirely to the company’s science and innovation.","Company in talks to license its know-how around the world .

A holiday cottage called 'Best view in Britain' is the latest beauty spot at risk of being blighted by a wind turbine. The property near Macclesfield, Cheshire, was christened after its uninterrupted panorama on the edge of the Peak District National Park. But plans for a 40metre wind turbine to be built just 300 metres away could soon prompt a name change. Best view in Britain: A holiday cottage overlooking the Cheshire countryside may have its view blighted by a wind turbine . Panorama: The owners boast of sunsets like the Caribbean, but are worried business will be spoilt by the eyesore . Owner Miranda Rijks says the planning application, if successful, will damage her business as well as the view. She is among dozens of residents who have joined Sutton Parish Council in opposing the plan for a wind turbine on Sutton Common. The Sutton Common fightback is just one of many battles being waged by local campaigners up and down the country, and comes days after Scottish tourism chiefs warned that wind farms could drive holidaymakers away. Submitted by local farmer Marshall Waller, the Sutton Common turbine is aimed at cutting power costs and providing clean energy. Objectors claim it will be unsightly and noisy. But, like so many others, they find current planning law, with its presumption in favour of renewable energy schemes, stacked against them. The law states that the adverse effects of a turbine can be proved to ‘significantly and demonstrably’ outweigh its supposed carbon-reduction benefits, then the application may approved regardless of how strongly the local community objects. Plans under consideration could leave the cottage (circled) sandwiched between a communications tower (left) and a 40metre wind turbine (in red) Mrs Rijks, who lives at Upton Fold Farm, where the cottage is based, has run the business for three years. She said: 'I run a holiday let called Best View in Britain - it’s clearly not going to be that anymore, not with a wind turbine in the way. 'It will ruin our beautiful open views.' If the turbine is built, her farm will be sandwiched between it and Bosley Tower - a reinforced concrete telecommunications mast owned by BT which will be powered by the turbine. Mrs Rijks added: 'They say they can’t put the turbine within a 300 metre radius of the tower because of the electromagnetic interference, but they are happy to put it within 300 metres of us.' On a national scale, concerns have been raised over the health impact of living near a wind turbine, with those affected claiming to suffer from dizziness, increased blood pressure, and depression. Mr Waller says the electricity will be sold to BT or put back in the National Grid, and the development is part of ongoing efforts to improve energy efficiency and sustainability. Fightback: Neighbours have vowed to oppose the application, made by a local farmer . Warning: Tourism chiefs in Scotland say wind farms may be putting holidaymakers off . He said: 'We have been researching and discussing, exhaustively, the possibilities of generating our own electricity for nearly four years.' It emerged earlier this month that energy suppliers were paid over £34million over 12 months to switch turbines off in high winds. The arrangement compensates them for the National Grid's inability to cope with the extra energy produced during high winds. Nevertheless, up to 32,000 wind turbines could be built in England and Wales over the next 40 years to meet carbon reduction targets. Many of the existing sites are owned by foreign firms which have made record profits in recent years.","Application submitted for a wind turbine on Sutton Common in Cheshire .

"By . Chris Brooke . PUBLISHED: . 12:05 EST, 22 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:18 EST, 22 November 2013 . An airline pilot has been jailed for nine months for being drunk in his cockpit before a flight. The judge said it was 'astonishing' that foreign pilots flying out of UK airports were unaware of the law here and believed it was legal to fly if there was a 12 hour gap 'from bottle to throttle.' Captain Irfan Faiz, 55, was more than four times the drink-fly limit when he was breathalysed after being spotted 'staggering' and 'not walking straight' on the way to the plane, a court heard. He was arrested and taken to a police station for questioning. Wreckless: Irfan Faiz was arrested fter being spotted 'staggering' around the airport minutes before he was due to fly a plane . Moments earlier he had been doing pre-flight checks in an Airbus 310 plane, which was due to fly from Leeds-Bradford airport to Islamabad in Pakistan with 145 passengers and 11 crew on board. Airport security staff had noticed he was eating mints and smelt strongly of alcohol, but Faiz told an airport manager who boarded the plane: 'I'm alright to fly it.' He was escorted back to the terminal and explained he had drunk three-quarters of a litre of whisky the night before - finishing his drinking session 18 hours earlier at 3am. Faiz told staff: 'I can't believe you can smell it on my breath after such a long time.' An initial breath test showed he had 41 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The limit for driving is 35 and for flying is nine. A later test at the police station showed his alcohol level was 28 - still more than three times the limit. A recently retired pilot who worked for Pakistan International Airlines appeared at Leeds Crown Court as a defence witness and said the company banned drinking for up to 12 hours before a flight - an increase on the previous eight hour rule. There was no specific limit on alcohol levels, the court heard. Danger: Jailing him the judge told Faiz that his actions could have had 'catastrophic consequences' Mr Justice Coulson said he found it 'extraordinary' that rules about pilots drinking 'can encompass any amount of alcohol' providing 12 hours has elapsed before the flight. He said: 'I consider this to be an extraordinarily inadequate way to try to prevent pilots drinking in a way that would not endanger their passengers.' Adding: 'It is, of course, astonishing, that pilots regularly flying from the UK are not aware of the rules that relate to their own conduct.' The judge told Faiz in general 'airline pilots who are in drink when they are about to fly will go to prison.' He said the flight 'could have had potential catastrophic consequences.' Adding: 'Many people find flying a difficult and nervous ordeal at the best of the times. They need to have absolute confidence in their safety and security.' Faiz admitted a charge of carrying out an ancillary aviation function while impaired by alcohol, contrary to the Railways and Transport Act 2003. The court heard he was a well-respected pilot with 25 years' experience and an unblemished record. Faiz's barrister, Paul Greaney QC, told the court his client 'had no idea' he was breaking UK rules at the time of the incident in September. He said the married father-of-two had been stressed because his wife in Pakistan had been robbed days earlier and there had been kidnap threats against his children. Faiz came from a distinguished family and his alcohol-related ban had brought shame on the family back home, the court heard. Alcohol is banned for Muslims in Pakistan - representing about 96% of the population. There is a 'zero tolerance' approach to drinking by PIA, but in practice the rules are flouted. A senior pilot has recently written to airline bosses, because of the Faiz prosecution, requesting clarification on specific rules relating to blood alcohol levels and time limits. Faiz was due to fly from Yorkshire to Islamabad in Pakistan with 145 passengers and 11 crew on board . Countries around the world set different blood alcohol levels and time limits for pilots. Although a source from the British Airline Pilots Association said most pilots regarded the permitted alcohol level internationally as 'pretty much zero.' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said: 'A pilot attempting to fly while under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs is a major threat to flight safety. 'At UK airports the police have legal powers to test pilots for drink and drugs. Such incidents, however, are very rare.'","Captain Irfan Faiz, 55, was more than .

The mother of a photographer who was killed after taking pictures of Justin Bieber's Ferrari in January has claimed that he was hit by two cars - possibly including one from the singer's entourage. Chris Guerra, 29, was knocked down by a car in Los Angeles on January 1 as he crossed the road after snapping Bieber's $200,000 white 458 Italia Ferrari, unaware the singer was not inside. But now TMZ has claimed that a second driver, whose vehicle fits the basic description of an SUV in Bieber's entourage, is wanted for felony hit-and-run after striking the photographer afterwards. Killed: Photographer Chris Guerra, 29, was hit by a car after snapping Justin Bieber's Ferrari in January. His mother now says he was hit by two cars - possibly including one from Bieber's entourage . Law enforcement sources reportedly told the website that they have used surveillance video and forensic evidence to conclude the vehicle was a black Range . Rover or a Hummer . Guerra's . mother, Vickie, added that she thinks it could have belonged to someone from Bieber's entourage who had been following his Ferrari or who was hoping to help its driver, rapper Lil Twist, after he was pulled over. Bieber was not in the vehicle or in town at the time of the crash, so it is unknown why any of his entourage would have been nearby. Police have not commented on the claim and said the investigation is ongoing. Guerra's mother said she wants police to . show her the surveillance footage of the accident so that she can see . who struck her son, but they have refused, telling her it's an ongoing . investigation. Mowed down: After a police officer told him to return to his car, Guerra crossed the road and was hit by this SUV, driven by a 69-year-old woman who has not faced any charges . Crash site: An SUV is pictured in the road after allegedly hitting Guerra as he crossed the road in Los Angeles . Tragic: Guerra's shoe and hat can be seen on the ground after he was struck and killed by a car . MailOnline has contacted a Bieber spokesperson for a comment. The tragedy unfolded after Lil Twist, who was behind the wheel of the Ferrari, was pulled over on the Freeway for allegedly speeding on the 405. Guerra, a freelance photographer, was tailing the car at the time after reportedly telling friends earlier that day that he had seen the singer smoking marijuana from a pipe. Bieber has denied this. Guerra got out of his car to take pictures but after police repeatedly told him to return to his vehicle, he ran across the road to his car - but he was struck by a Toyota Highlander SUV. He died at a hospital shortly after. Photographs taken from the scene show Guerra's hat and shoe lying in the road where he was hit. His heartbroken family said they found out about his death from television even though they had repeatedly called the LAPD to ask if it was their son who had died.

"Teenager says she DID NOT sign a prenuptial agreement with Doug . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:33 EST, 27 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:43 EST, 27 November 2013 . Her constant flirting with TOWIE star Mario Falcone on UK's Celebrity Big Brother is thought to be one of the reasons why her short-lived marriage to Doug Hutchinson collapsed. And now newly single Courtney Stodden has revealed that she's still in contact with her former housemate. The 19-year-old says she often speaks to Mario on the telephone, and is making plans to see him when she visits London again in the near future. Scroll down for video . Opening up: Courtney Stodden has opened up about her failed marriage to husband Doug Hutchison . 'He slowed down': The reality star says that she and Doug stopped having sex after her stint on UK's Celebrity Big Brother . 'We talk... Obviously, he’s a whole world away and I'm way over here but we talk,' she reveals in an exclusive interview with the MailOnline. 'I’m going to be going to London here and there so yeah, I’ll probably meet up with him and Warren (Gatland) and all the other fun and crazy people that I know. And when they come here too.' Courtney, who sensationally announced her split with Doug, 53, earlier this month, says that while she hasn't thought too much about dating again just yet, she wouldn't rule out a relationship with the 25-year-old reality star, who is closer to her own age. Doing what she does best: Courtney recently posed in this racy photo shoot, where she showed off her surgical enhancements in a barely-there bikini . She loves her Daisy Dukes: The bubbly blonde modelled an array of tiny denim shorts . Hardly a cover up: Courtney's cowl-neck top failed to cover her white bra as she strolled along the beach . 'I haven’t thought that far. I’m kind of a personality girl and I go by personality and who can make me laugh,' she explains. 'If anybody can make me laugh, they have a date'. The bubbly blonde also admits that Doug was none too thrilled about her relationship with Mario in the house. Courtney was seen constantly flirting with the TOWIE star on the reality show, with the pair getting especially close during one housemate challenge, which saw them being tied together. Her version of demure: Courtney also bared her midriff in a cropped yellow cardigan . The sands of time: Courtney also admitted that she is not quite ready to date just yet after her break-up with Doug, but is looking forward to experiencing new relationships . Several days into her stint on Big Brother, Doug paid his teen bride a visit, and while the Green Mile actor was thrilled to be reunited with Courtney, the feeling was not so mutual. As the teen relished in her newfound independence, the couple drifted apart. Courtney says that things with Doug got so bad after the show, the couple even stopped having sex. 'When I came back from Big Brother, we didn’t have sex at all,' she explains. 'We did once after I saw him and that was it. 'I’m . a girl, a young a woman, and as a girl I feel we have to be emotionally . connected to be turned on and want to be intimate with someone. No wonder she's chilly! Courtney felt the cold on the beach of Malibu as she strolled around in tiny shorts and a bikini for her photo shoot . Covered up! Courtney later covered up with a white lacy shawl . 'So emotionally speaking, in a romantic way, I was so checked out. So we weren’t having sex.' And to add further insult to injury, . Courtney says now they have split she won't miss having sex with her ex-husband, who she . believes is 'slowing down a little bit'. Instead she is keen to discuss her own ferocious sexual appetite, admitting that she wants to experience love making of 'all kinds'. 'Our . sex was good, I’m not going to lie, but I’m a young girl who wants to . experience sex of all kinds and he’s an older man and he’s slowing down . a  little bit,' she says. 'I think even if we were having sex day in and day out, I think I’d still be feeling this way. I just wanted more sex.' Innocence: Courtney was just 16-years-old when she married Doug, 53 . Experimenting: Courtney slipped on a brunette wig on Wednesday to experiment with her look and shared the snaps on her Instagram page . Earlier this month, Courtney and Doug . signed a separation agreement, stating that the couple will 'continue to . support one another as friends and business partners'. But when it comes to the pair's divorce, it remains to be seen as to how they will split their assets. Courtney reveals that she didn't sign a pre-nup with Doug before the couple exchanged vows in Las Vegas over two years ago. Flirty: Courtney's flirtation with fellow Big Brother contestant Mario Falcone is thought to be one of the reasons behind the demise in her marriage with Doug . Attached: For one housemate challenge Courtney and Mario were tied together . She claims that at the time of their impending nuptials she had suggested one, but Doug flat out refused. 'I offered and he said, ""I don’t want to do that because I trust you and we’re getting married""' she insists. 'He didn’t want a pre-nup. So we’ve talked about what we want to do financially now.' For now the couple are still under the same roof, with Doug 'staying in one bedroom and Courtney in the other'. Reunion: Courtney says she speaks to Mario on the phone and will see him when she next goes to London . But . the decision to remain living together is surely a difficult one, . especially for Doug who has been left 'heartbroken' by the split. Courtney . also describes the moment she told her husband that she was 'unhappy' in their marriage, just weeks after her stint in the Big Brother house. 'He . was heartbroken. He already knew, but to hear me tell him that I’m not . happy in this marriage kind of put it into reality for him,' she says. Moving on: Courtney, seen with this gentleman at an event just last week, says she wouldn't discount being with an older man again . 'I . think it was kind of surreal for to hear me say that. So of course, he . was crying, I was crying. We both didn’t want this to happen but we’re . both trying to get through it.' According to Courtney, Doug is also having difficulty coming to terms with his ex-wife getting intimate with other men. 'I’ve experienced different people sexually but he (Doug) was the first person I ever fully had sex with,' she explains. No pre-nup: Courtney also revealed that she did not sign a pre-nup with Doug before the pair exchanged vows in 2011 . 'But I think it burned him, the idea of me being with someone else. I think it kicked him in the stomach. 'I think he wasn’t fond of the idea at . first but he actually told me last night, ""You deserve to go out with . your friends, you deserve to meet other people, you deserve to make love . to another man. ""You deserve to be young and independent."" It was great for him to say that.' What's next for Courtney? The bubbly blonde teen says she is looking forward to getting her drivers license . And while her first experience with a much older man didn't exactly go to plan, Courtney won't be ruling out dating another person twice, if not older than her age. 'Never say never, but I’m going to try to lower the age a little bit, that’s my goal, but who knows,' she says. 'I will learn from this, I’m not planning on going out with another 53-year-old, that’s for sure. I mean, people say age is just a number and I said that also and obviously age isn’t just a number. 'There are some things you have to contend with. I’m not saying just because there’s an age difference it won’t work. 'There are some successful marriages between people with an age gap but its not for everybody and obviously I’ll keep that in mind for the future.' After Doug married Courtney when she was just 16-years-old, his family, friends and even his agent turned their backs on him. The star, who appeared in the Oscar winning movie, The Green Mile, even lost several acting jobs. Courtney admits that at the beginning of their marriage she felt responsible, but after recently ending things with the actor she feels she can finally feel free from the guilt. 'I did feel responsibility because he did lose his family, his agent did drop him, his work stopped coming in, so I definitely felt a huge responsibility on my shoulders, especially for our not being happy in the marriage and admitting that to him because I’m sure that probably scared him to death,' she says. 'So I did feel guilty then but after his reaction and us going through the initial sadness of the breakup, he said, ""I love you and I want you to be happy, please don’t feel guilty."" 'His reaction really took that away from me, so I don’t feel guilty anymore.' As for the future, Courtney is just happy to be doing things that normal teenagers do, including finally getting her drivers license. She is also planning on moving forward with her acting career and hints that she has a reality show in the pipeline. As for her well-documented surgical enhancements, the teen star says she is planning on getting more in the future. 'When gravity starts taking place, yeah,' she says. 'Anybody who has breast implants has to go in every 8 to 10 years to keep them up so I will have to go in and fix that here and there but other than that I’m really happy with myself.'",Teenager says she DID NOT sign a prenuptial agreement with Doug .

Jason Everman could have been a footnote in the history of grunge: the guy who was kicked out of not one but two of the biggest bands in the iconic '90s scene. Dismissed by Kurt Cobain as a 'moody metalhead', and fired from Soundgarden because it 'wasn't working out', Everman, now 45, had his dreams of rock 'n' roll greatness snatched away as grunge reached its height. But he didn't want to dwell on what could have been - or be harping on about how he was once in Nirvana 20 years later. So in 1993, at the age of 26 and with a career touring the world with the biggest bands of the time already behind him, Everman joined the Army. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Renaissance man: Military vet, rock guitarist and philosophy major Jason Everman . '... I thought this was it. This was going to be my identity,' Everman told The New York Times Magazine of his music career in a recent profile. Nirvana's Krist Novoselic said, 'We had some great . shows with Jason. But then things went south really fast.' In a band . that was to become known for the dark moods of its front man, Everman . was too depressive. It was Everman who paid the $606.17 recording fee for Nirvana's debut album Bleach. They credited him as guitarist on the album's notes, even though he didn't play on the album, but they never did pay him back. After the crushing blow of being kicked out of Nirvana, Everman stumbled into his dream gig - playing guitar for Soundgarden. 1989: A Soundgarden promotional shot featuring drummer Matt Cameron (left), lead guitarist Kim Thayil (top center), bassist Jason Everman (bottom center), and singer Chris Cornell (right) After a massive world tour, Everman turned up for what he thought was a band meeting - but instead he received his marching orders. It seems his moods again were the reason his band-mates had difficulty working with him. 'He was funny and witty, and then a cloud would come over him. He would sit in the bus and be really mad with his headphones on all the time,' Soundgarden's road manager told The New York Times Magazine. As a child, Everman's moods were also getting him in trouble so his worried grandmother sent him to a therapist, who also happened to be a guitar enthusiast. Everman picked up his first guitar in the offices of his therapist. Soon after, he discovered punk rock and spent much of high school playing in bands. With the band: Everman's temperament didn't fit in with his Soundgarden, but he did have the right hair . A low period followed Everman's dismissal from Soundgarden before he picked himself back up, moved to San Francisco and joined another band, Mindfunk. It was there that he realized he needed to do something, 'something impossible'. 'I was in all the cool bands,' Everman told The New York Times Magazine. 'I was psyched to do the most uncool thing you could possibly do.' The grunge guitarist with his head of tumbling strawberry blond curls, nose-ring and Motorhead t-shirts got on a bus bound for Army training camp at Fort Benning in Georgia to undergo the 61-day training course. The Rangers are the Army's elite infantry unit; Everman was one month into his training when Cobain committed suicide and his commanding officers and recruits figured out who he was. According to his former Army colleagues, Everman never mentioned his illustrious past, but somehow it always found him out. After his first enlistment, Everman's ambitions hadn't been satisfied and he applied for the Special Forces. It was during training that he watched a plane hit one of the twin towers and realized he was going to war. War hero: Jason Everman (center, in 2009) was awarded the coveted Combat Infantryman badge . The New York Times Magazine profile describes Everman 'riding horseback with the Pashtun, helicoptering in for midnight raids, sitting at a base for days at a time with absolutely nothing to do. Everman saw Soviet tanks rusting in the Panjshir Valley. He smelled the poppy fields outside of Kandahar.' In war, Everman became a rockstar soldier. His cabin is filled with badges honoring his service to his country, and photographs of him with the nation's political leaders. 'Throughout my adult life I have made the conscious effort to develop three aspects of who I am: the artist, the soldier and the philosopher,' Everman said. He left the military in 2006, and enrolled at Columbia University, studying philosophy. Everman graduated with a BA in Philosophy on May 20. According to a Columbia University profile of Everman, he has also worked as a commercial fisherman in Alaska and for a period lived as a monk in Nepal. After his great achievements musically and in fighting for his country, it seems Everman is at last sated. His next move, he told The New York Times Magazine, may be something distinctly more ordinary. 'I'll probably just be a bartender somewhere,' he said.","Jason Everman was in Nirvana and Soundgarden, two of the '90s biggest bands - but was kicked out of both .

A teenager who was bullied as a child after an agonising spine condition left her with a hunchback and severe limp has landed a job as a catwalk model. Zoe Blenkinsop, 19, from North Shields, Tyne and Wear, has suffered with scoliosis since childhood and was bullied throughout school because she had a lump which protruded from her back where her spine curved. She would spend hours practicing her poses and catwalk runs but struggled as her curved spine, which left her with a limp, shattered her confidence. Zoe Blenkinsop, 19, suffered from severe scoliosis - curvature of the spine - since childhood and was in so much pain she was unable to sit or stand up for long . When she was diagnosed with the condition aged 11, doctors said they could perform an operation to correct the problem but she would have to wait until she had finished growing at 18. And now, after undergoing the gruelling seven-hour operation, she is finally walking tall. Zoe said: ‘I was always so conscious about my back because there was such a huge lump sticking out from it. ‘I never allowed anyone to take pictures of me because I didn’t want them to see it. ‘In PE I would hide in a corner to get changed so that no-one saw it as I was already being bullied. ‘When I was told I could have the operation I was so happy but I knew I had to wait a long time for it.’ Zoe says her back was sometimes so painful it caused her to pass out and that she had to change for PE with her back to a wall so no one saw it . The curvature in her spine was so severe she had a hunchback and a limp, about which she was bullied . Zoe (pictured before her surgery) said: 'I used to look at everyone else in school and think about when I would be normal like them' In July 2011 Zoe was finally able to go ahead with the procedure and was in surgery for seven hours while surgeons fitted metal rods to straighten her spine. It took her a year to recover from the major surgery and she had to teach herself how to walk, sit and stand all over again. Zoe is now able to fulfil her dream of modelling and is no longer worried about what others think of her.

Zoe had a seven-hour operation during which surgeons inserted metal rods into her spine to straighten it . ‘The pain would be horrible some days and I wasn’t able to sit or stand for a long time. ‘The only way to ease it was to lie down which was pretty embarrassing, I felt like an old lady. ‘Recovering from the operation took a long time and it was really hard. ‘I wasn’t allowed crutches as I had to be able to support myself, some days I would pass out with the pain but I kept going.’ Zoe says that since her surgery she no longer worries about what other people think of her . Scoliosis causes the spine to curve and affects about four per cent of the population. If left untreated, it can lead to fatal heart and lung problems and considerably damage mobility. Zoe had her first taste of modelling success when she stepped on to the catwalk for Newcastle Fashion Week. She said: ‘Modelling has always been a dream of mine but I never thought it was possible.

The only way to ease it was to lie down which was pretty embarrassing, I felt like an old lady' ‘I knew that standing and posing for shoots would be impossible and I would have been far too scared to walk down the catwalk with my limp. ‘I was in constant pain and couldn’t imagine having the lifestyle I have now.’ Zoe now hopes to take her modelling career onto the next level building up her portfolio with fashion shoots and one day hopes to walk the catwalks of fashion weeks worldwide. Deborah Waller, from Scoliosis Association UK, said: ‘Scoliosis is where the spine curves sideways and can also twist the spinal column, pulling the ribcage out of position. Zoe said that before her operation (left) she couldn't imagine having the lifestyle she has now (right) The surgery has left Zoe with a scar down her back but has dramatically improved the shape of her spine . ‘A few of the signs of scoliosis are uneven shoulders, an asymmetrical waist, tilted hips, or uneven shoulder blades. ‘Although many people have not heard of the condition, it is surprisingly common, with three to four children per 1000 needing specialist supervision. ‘It can develop at different times throughout life but the most common form appears during adolescence. ‘While there are around 2,000 scoliosis operations in the UK every year, surgery is not the right choice for everybody and whatever treatment decisions are made, it is important to be monitored by a scoliosis specialist.’ Scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an S-shape. Signs include a visible curve in the spine, one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other, clothes not hanging properly and back pain. Pain usually only affects adults with the condition. In most cases, the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy. In the UK, scoliosis affects three to four children out of every 1,000. It is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis. It is more common in women than in men. Most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows. However, in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing. Occasionally, a child needs surgery to straighten their spine. In adults, it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain.

A former Senate aide who spent decades climbing through the ranks in Washington has revealed how the Capitol was run by men who drank bourbon at all hours, had sex with secretaries and accepted thousands of dollars in bribes. Robert Gene Baker worked first as a page in the Senate, transferring phone calls and keeping track of vote counts, but grew his role so that he ended up being former President Lyndon Baines Johnson’s closest aide. Baker was eventually arrested for theft and tax evasion in 1967, but he has now opened up to Politico Magazine about the lawless manner that dominated DC at that time. The spy who loved me: President Kennedy allegedly had an affair with Ellen Rometsch (right), the wife of a West German army officer based in D.C. Bobby Kennedy feared she was a spy and would reveal their affair, so he had her deported . Strange bedfellows: Then-Congressman Gerald Ford (seen here in 1966) also reportedly had an affair with the same woman and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had recordings of their time together . Investigators: Hoover allegedly used the tape to blackmail Ford (right) who was a member of the Warren Commission investigating President Kennedy's death because Hoover wanted to know what they found out . His most salacious revelation came about Presidents Kennedy and Ford, who allegedly had affairs with the same East German woman- who was later believed to be a spy. Baker knew Ellen Rometsch because she was the wife of a West German army officer stationed in Washington. She was ‘as pretty as Elizabeth Taylor’ and the trappings of marriage did not stop her from making herself known to the President. ‘She really loved oral sex... She went to the White House several times. And President Kennedy called me and said it’s the best head-job he’d ever had, and he thanked me,’ Baker said to Politico. Rometsch was sent to America by the Communist leaders in East Berlin who hoped that she would befriend powerful politicians and report back. She went to West Germany and married air force Rolf Rometsch who then moved with her to the United States. She began working as a hostess at the Quorum Club, a salon for male politicians that was organized by Baker. As part of her role there, she arranged prostitutes and went on dates with some of the men herself- which clearly led to influential connections. Her alleged dalliances did not stop at the White House, as she also had relations with then-Congressman ‘Jerry’ Ford from Michigan, who went on to become president after Nixon resigned. Ford’s relationship with Ms Rometsch allegedly took place during his time on the Warren Commission where he was tasked with investigating President Kennedy’s assassination. The affair was used against him by FBI director J. Edgar Hoover who was frustrated that the Warren Commission was not sharing their findings, . ‘So, (Hoover) had this tape where Jerry Ford was having oral sex with Ellen Rometsch. You know, his wife had a serious drug problem back then… Hoover blackmailed… Ford to tell him what they were doing,’ Baker said. Wheeler and dealer: These salacious revelations were made public by Robert Gene 'Bobby' Baker (seen in 1964) who rose through the ranks in Washington and became a close personal aide to President Johnson . For Baker, that was crossing a line that should not be crossed, even in such a rule-averse atmosphere. ‘That’s the reason I don’t like him. It’s just a misuse of authority,’ Baker said. One use of power that didn’t seem to bother Baker was the fact that then-Attorney General Bobby Kennedy had Ms Romestch deported back to Germany because he was afraid of word of his brother’s affair with the possible Communist spy would leak after his death. The Romestch affairs were far from the only instances of sexual impropriety that Baker revealed during his lengthy interview. He told of how Democratic California Senator Tommy Kuchel was having an affair with his secretary and asked Baker to have a page go ‘buy him some rubbers’, and how Senator Estes Kefauver from Tennessee would use his role organizing a hearing about high school delinquency to prey on the youngsters who testified. ‘(Kefauver) had a bad alcohol problem and he also had a very bad record of wanting to go to bed with every woman he ever met. He got some of these young kids testifying, you know, before his Juvenile Committee or something and then he couldn’t wait to go to bed with them,’ Baker said. ‘Senator (Jacob) Javits was a publicity hound. He was a very, very bright man, but he was another one—like Senator Jack Kennedy—he was a sex maniac. One of the postmen went in and caught him on his couch having a sexual affair with a Negro lady. He couldn’t wait to come and tell me.’ Power broker: Kennedy (right) reportedly called on Johnson (left) to use Baker's connections to assess various vote counts and to see how he could pass different initiatives like Medicare and the Voting Rights Act . The aura of free love was certainly helped by the endless streams of alcohol that went at all hours. Baker recalled how Senators and aides would regularly convene in offices with fully stocked bars- like that of Senate Republican leader Everett Dirksen who displayed a clock on with every number replaced with a ‘5’ so that no matter what time of day it was, it was always acceptable to drink. Similarly, it was an unspoken understanding that votes in the Senate could be bought and entire towns could be given a price when it came to national elections. Mixing business and pleasure: Baker was eventually jailed for tax evasion and theft . ‘It made my job much easier because a man that you have helped when he is running for his life, and he’s run out of money, and you send him $50,000, boy he is grateful…. We had no rules,’ Baker said. In one instance, Baker was shocked to learn that a Democratic Senator from Oklahoma- who should have supported President Kennedy’s Medicare program- had struck a deal with doctors in his home state who were opposed to the proposal and then bought off at least one fellow senator for $200,000. Even getting President Kennedy in office cost a pretty penny, as Rein Vander Zee- a top aide to Kennedy’s Democratic rival Hubert Humphrey- revealed that the Massachusetts man’s family paid up to get him into the White House. ‘Vander Zee, until his dying day, said that Humphrey would have defeated Kennedy… had it not been for that massive cash old man Joe [Kennedy] bought the election with,’ Baker said. Once in office, Kennedy clearly revelled in the role as Baker recalled a time the two of them were walking through the back offices of the Senate: ‘We had these sofas and chairs, and there’s the mirror where… Kennedy said, “God, why did you make me so beautiful?”’ In spite of the alcohol and ethical abuses that appear to be rampant in the 1950s and 1960s, he said that one way that the ‘good old days’ truly earned the title was because Republicans and Democrats worked together. Baker said that though his relationship with Johnson ended poorly, still believes that the Texan president should be credited with one of the most important achievements in recent history. ‘When I see my Negro friends, I tell them, “You go say a little prayer for LBJ.” Because I said, “The Voting Rights Act made us all equal.” The only way in hell that Senator Obama ever got elected president was because of the Voting Rights Act. I said, ‘It’s the greatest thing that’s happened to our country,’ Baker said.","Bobby Baker, a former aide to LBJ has revealed how Washington was full of drunk, philandering politicians in Kennedy's era .

Massachusetts, have filed lawsuits claiming that a trio of large wind turbines . located near their homes have been harming their health. In the summer of 2010, the town of Falmouth and a private . company called Notus Clean Energy erected three 400-feet-tall, 1.63 megawatt . wind turbines. Just months later, Sue Hobart, a 57-year-old wedding . florist, began experiencing spells of dizziness, bouts of insomnia, ringing in . her ears and severe headaches. Plaintiff: Sue Hobart, a 57-year-old wedding florist, has filed a lawsuit claiming that a trio of wind turbines that were installed in her town of Falmouth, Massachusetts, had made her sick . Too close for comfort: Mrs Hobart said that just months after the town and a private energy company installed the turbines 1,600 feet from her home, she began experiencing insomnia, dizziness and tinnitus . At first, Mrs Hobart attributed her symptoms to the onset of . old age, but then she noticed that whenever she was away from home, the . symptoms vanished. ‘Sometimes at night, especially in the winter, I wake up . with a fluttering in the chest and think, “What the hell is that,”’ and the . only place it happens is at my house,’ she told ABC News. Hobart began suspecting that the culprits behind her ailments . may be the trio of wind turbines whirring away day and night just 1,600 feet . from her home. In 2011, a doctor at Harvard Medical School diagnosed the . woman with 'wind turbine syndrome’ - a controversial health condition that is . not recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 'Wind Turbine Syndrome' refers to an alleged medical disorder in which people who live in close proximity to turbines begin experiencing a wide array of symptoms, such as tinnitus, dizziness, migraines and insomnia. The name was coined by Dr Nina Pierpont, a pediatrician from Johns Hopkins Hospital whose husband has been lobbying against the proliferation of wind energy. In 2009, Pierpont self-published the book 'Wind Turbine Syndrome,' which included case studies of people who reportedly got sick as a result of their proximity to wind farms. The wind turbine syndrome, dubbed by Pierpont the green energy industry's 'dirty little secret,' is not recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Piepront's research has come under fire from industry experts, who accused her of possibly skewing the data by looking at a small sample size without a control group and failing to submit her results for an impartial peer review. The name of the alleged disorder was coined by Dr Nina . Pierpont, a pediatrician whose husband has been lobbying against the . proliferation of wind energy. Pierpont self-published the book 'Wind Turbine syndrome' in . 2009, providing case studies of people who reportedly got sick as a result of . their proximity to wind turbines. 'Many people living within 2 km (1.25 miles) of these . spinning giants get sick. So sick that they often abandon (as in, lock the door . and leave) their homes,’ according to the book’s description. ‘Nobody wants to . buy their acoustically toxic homes.' Pierpont's research has come under criticism from wind . energy advocates, who claim that her data was unreliable because she used only . a small sample size, had no control group, interviewed her subjects by phone . and then hand-picked experts for the peer review process. Hobart and her husband filed a nuisance claim against Notus . Clean Energy and its owner in February, seeking between $150,000 and $300,000 . in damages for the loss of their home value and medical bills. The lawyer representing the owner of the energy company, Dan . Webb, responded to the complaint by stating that Notus' operating permit was . 'subject to rigorous review' and the company was in compliance with all the regulations. ‘Scientific research and studies have shown that wind . turbines such as Notus do not cause a nuisance or adverse health effects,’ said . attorney Michael O'Neill in the court filing. According to Notus, in three years of operation the turbines . have prevented emissions of more than 7,000 tons of carbon dioxide from . conventional power plants. The lawyer also said that the nearest home to its turbines . is located some 1,700 feet away, which is about 500 feet further away than the . distance required under state law. Wind turbines are used to generate electricity from the . kinetic power of the wind. There are two main kinds of wind generators:  those with a vertical axis, and those with a . horizontal axis. Expert opinion: A study by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and Public Health has concluded that wind turbines like the ones erect in Falmouth (pictured) present little more than an 'annoyance' to residents . Most wind energy . comes from turbines that can be as tall as a 20-story building and have . three 200-foot-long blades, according to National Geographic. The . biggest wind turbines generate enough electricity to supply about 600 . U.S. homes. a single megawatt produced by a wind turbine is enough to . power about 250 homes. Generation of energy by wind turbines more than quadrupled between 2000 and 2006 worldwide. Germany currently leads the world in the number of wind turbines, followed by Spain, the United States, India, and Denmark. Industry experts predict that, by 2050 a third of the world's electricity will be generated by turbines. Neil and Betsy Anderson, also of Falmouth, were major supporters . of green energy until their town installed two turbines 1,320 and 2,320 feet . away from their home. Mr Anderson said that within a week, he began experiencing pressure . in his ears, which later turned into tinnitus, as well as shortness of breath, . headaches and heart palpitations. The homeowner’s wife had suffered from debilitating migraines, . which she had attributed to the turbines working around the clock. Some experts have suggested that symptoms reported by . residents of towns located near turbines could be purely psychological in . nature and caused by the nocebo effect - the negative reaction experienced by a . patient who is exposed to a harmless substance. Controversial figure: The name 'wind tirbune syndrome' was coined by Dr Nina Pierpont (left), who in 2009 self-published a book on the subject (right) with case studies of people who reportedly got sick from  turbines . Mr Anderson, however, insisted that his symptoms were purely . physical and not the products of an overactive imagination. ‘Just come in to my house and feel the walls shaking,’ he . said . A recent study commissioned by the Massachusetts Department . of Environmental Protection and Public Health has concluded that wind turbines . present little more than an ‘annoyance’ to residents. A 2010 study conducted by the National Health and Median . Research Council of Australia found no negative effects from wind technology. Meanwhile, Sue Hobart said that she was forced to move away . from Falmouth and put her home, which she and her husband had built themselves, . up for sale, but it's value has dropped by half after she went public with her . complaints about the nearby turbines.","Sue Hobart, 57, is suing town of Falmouth and Notus Clean Energy claiming that their three wind turbines are behind her health problems .

Legendary radio announcer Casey Kasem will die in the next few months according to a representative of his wife, Jean. TMZ.Com reports legal documents submitted by Kasem's wife during a small claims court case last week between Kasem and a former caregiver states: 'My husband is terminally ill and unable to leave home.' The Kasems were represented in court by the wife of Jean's lawyer who requested a continuance of the case for a 'few months'. According to the legal request, that is the period of time given for Kasem's 'situation to resolve or end, unfortunately.' Radio star Casey Kasem has just months to live, according to representatives of his wife, Jean. The legendary announcer and voice artist, is pictured here in 2004. He is suffering from Parkinson's Disease . The revealing case, in which Kasem's former housekeeper and caregiver Hilda Loza sued for $10,000 claiming she was mistreated and cheated by Jean, was thrown out of court on Friday because the suit was improperly served, according to a judge. Kasem, now 81 years old, is an American pop culture legend whose voice became familiar to millions around the world as host of the iconic internationally-syndicated radio show American Top 40. He also voiced the popular character Shaggy from the cartoon series Scooby-Doo. Happy family: Casey Kasem (left) with wife Jean(right) and daughter Liberty (front), in a photograph taken in 2000. Kasem is diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease and is taken care of by Jean and now-adult Liberty. Julie Kasem, Casey's daughter from his first marriage, had sued to be given charge of Kasem's affairs . Kasem was born Kemal Amin Kasem in Detroit, Michigan, in 1932 to Lebanese parents who migrated from the British Mandate of Palestine before coming to the United States. In her suit, Loza alleged Jean, Kasem's second wife, denigrated her cooking, ordered her to drive Casey around Los Angeles but would not pay her gas expenses, and suggested the housekeeper would steal food, towels, toilet paper and silverware even though nothing was ever alleged stolen. Casey Kasem (right) with his wife Jean (left) pictured in 2004. The Kasems have been hit by a law suit that alleged Jean mistreated a housekeeper. The suit was been thrown out of court after a judge rules it was improperly served . The suit is the second case this week involving Kasem and his wife. A judge declared last week he would not intervene in Kasem's affairs after a court-appointed attorney said the ill radio host had received adequate medical care for advanced Parkinson's disease. Attorney Samuel Ingham told Judge Roy Paul that he visited Kasem and did not see an immediate need for a 'conservatorship'. Conservatorship is a legal term where a guardian is appointed by a judge to manage the financial affairs and daily life of an individual with physical or mental limitations or old age. Kasem's daughter Julie, from the radio star's first marriage, had filed a petition for a temporary conservatorship, accusing her father's second wife of blocking her and two of her siblings from seeing their father and preventing them from making decisions about his medical care. Kasem lives at home with his Jean, his wife of 33 years, and their adult daughter Liberty Jean.","Legendary host of American Top 40 radio show revealed  in court documents as 'terminally ill' and 'unable to leave' his Los Angeles home .

Now Am I Pretty, an online trend that began in the USA, has been turned into a play. The brainchild of artist Louise Orwin, Pretty Ugly charts her foray into the world of pretty/ugly videos in which girls, most of whom are in their early teens, post clips of themselves and ask viewers to tell them whether or not they're good-looking. Unsurprisingly, some of the comments are cruel in the extreme and even more worryingly, many of the clearly under-age girls are propositioned by men - nearly all of whom are well past the age of 18. Scroll down for video . Experiment: Louise (pictured) posed as a teenager to see what sort of response Pretty/Ugly videos get . Among them are 'SmileLoveBeauty8', a pretty dark haired girl who appears to be no older than 13, whose video shows her striking a series of poses, including provocative shots of her lying in bed and a close-up of her cleavage. Underneath the video, more than 12,000 comments have been submitted ranging from the concerned ('you are asking for paedos') to the approving ('God made you beautiful') and the downright nasty ('ugly as f***'). Orwin is no stranger to this sort of comment herself, having experimented by putting three different pretty/ugly videos - all differently styled - on the site. The feedback shocked her. 'I got torrents of abuse,' revealed the 26-year-old artist in an interview with Wired magazine. Blog: Louise has now launched a website and blog detailing her experiences in the Am I Pretty? world . 'People were telling me to f*** off and die. I woke up and read all of this abuse and I really felt it in my stomach. I had to remind myself that it's not me, it's the character.' Her new show, which will top the billing at the Camden People's Theatre from the 23rd October until the 5th November, is based on her experiences and begins with her posing the pretty/ugly question to the audience. It is, she argues, important to try and understand what's going on and where the desire to be judged on your looks comes from. 'Now if you look on Tumblr, YouTube, Twitter, it's not the media, but the teenage girls themselves perpetuating this myth [of beauty]. Worrying: Many of the comments posted below the videos are cruel or have inappropriate content . 'They are resharing these images, reblogging. There's always going to be peer pressure but I think [social media] makes these issues worse.' And to stop it? The answer, she concludes, is not stricter parental locks but getting girls to take more responsibility for themselves. 'It's about changing attitudes towards things and teaching girls to take responsibility for themselves online.' You can only hope that her play and blog succeed in persuading them to do so.

If you visit West India Quay today in the shadow of the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, you’ll find a £550-a-night Marriott hotel and thousands of wealthy bankers. But back in 19th century East London, it was a bustling storage area for goods imported from the West Indies. The West India Docks were built to great fanfare at the end of the 18th century as a response to overcrowding and theft in the riverside quays. Scroll down for video .

Old and new: Sugar being hoisted into warehouses at West India Docks in 1900 (left), where the Museum of London Docklands now stands (right) At the time, it was the largest and most expensive building project in the world, costing £82million in today’s money and stretching for almost a mile. The Ledger Building - now a JD Wetherspoon pub - was where dock records were kept and the original gateway was just beyond this point. Manual workers at the docks were employed as casuals, and would queue at the dock gates for the ‘call-on’ when some would be chosen to work. These men were often half-starved and desperate to work - but if they were picked, their jobs were backbreaking. In addition, the abrasive sugar leaking from the sacks rubbed their necks, shoulders and hands raw - giving the quayside the old name of Blood Alley. The docks were heavily bombed during the . Blitz and after the Second World War the warehouses were replaced by . modern storage sheds.

These . no longer exist but you can still see cranes used in the 1960s, before . dock closures began in the 1970s, mainly due to containerisation. The London upriver docks were not large . enough to receive the new ships - and so the Tilbury Docks down the . river in Essex were developed. The . building then became derelict - but in 2000 work began on restoring and . converting the Grade I-listed building for use as a museum. Now, the Museum of London .

Each storey was once a different height - dictated by the cargo's nature. The ground floors were made to store two tiers of hogsheads of ‘clayed’ sugar. The upper floors stored a single tier of the heavier hogsheads of muscovado sugar, while the top floors held lighter cargoes such as coffee and cocoa. Now the wider area of Canary Wharf is one of London's two main financial centres and is home to the likes of Barclays, HSBC and KPMG. The 97-acre estate got its name from the fact that many of the imports which arrived there in the past when it was a dock were from the Canary Islands.

Rain as acidic as lemon juice may have played a part in killing off plants and organisms around the world during the most severe mass extinction in Earth's history. A team of U.S. scientists have simulated the Great Dying, which occurred around 252 million years ago, when the vast majority of species became extinct. While the massive extinction is a matter of scientific debate, the researchers found that sulphur emissions from massive volcano eruptions, were significant enough to create extremely acidic rain, which could have affected plant growth. Rain as acidic as lemon juice may have played a part in killing off plants and organisms around the world during the most severe mass extinction in Earth's history, 252 million years ago, according to MIT researchers. A forest devastated by acid rain is pictured . The Great Dying is the Earth's most severe known extinction event, with up to 96 per cent of all marine species and 70 per cent of terrestrial vertebrate species becoming extinct. Scientists largely believe it was made up of three phases, including a gradual environmental change and a catastrophic event. Possible catastrophes include a massive chain of volcanic eruptions, fires from the Siberian Traps and a sudden release of methane clathrate from the sea floor, which is also known as fire ice. Pin-pointing the exact cause of the Great Dying is difficult as much as the evidence created some 250 million years ago has now disappeared or is concealed within multiple layers of rock. A huge impact event has been suggested as a possible cause of the mass extinction, based on the examination of grains of 'shocked quartz' and meteorite fragments in Antarctica, but no impact site has been found. One of the attractions of the theory is that it could trigger other causes such as the Siberian Traps eruptions. Widespread ocean anoxia (a severe deficiency of oxygen) has also been blamed for the event in the Late Permian to the Early Triassic. The spread of toxic, oxygen-depleted water would have been devastating for marine life, producing widespread die-offs. Models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia (the presence of hydrogen sulphide) would have been closely associated with high levels of carbon dioxide, which suggests a combination of gases acted as a killing mechanism. Scientists believe the sequence of events leading to anoxic oceans may have been triggered by carbon dioxide emissions from the eruption of the Siberian Traps. Researchers at MIT investigated the theory for the Great Dying that volcanic eruptions in the Siberian Traps triggered a cascade of environmental events. They discovered that sulphur emissions were significant enough to create widespread acid rain throughout the Northern Hemisphere, with pH levels reaching 2 - as acidic as undiluted lemon juice. They believe such acidity may have been sufficient to disfigure plants and stunt their growth, contributing to their ultimate extinction. ‘Imagine you're a plant that's growing happily in the latest Permian,’ said Benjamin Black, a postdoctoral researcher in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. ‘It's been getting hotter and hotter, but perhaps your species has had time to adjust to that. But then quite suddenly, over the course of a few months, the rain begins to sizzle with sulphuric acid. It would be quite a shock if you were that plant,’ he said. Geologists who have examined the rock record in Siberia have observed evidence of a huge chain of volcanic eruptions that came in short bursts beginning near the end of the Permian period and continued for another million years. The volume of magma produced, was several million cubic kilometres, which is enough to completely cover the U.S. This boiling stew of magma probably released carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere, leading to gradual but powerful global warming, according to the study, which was published in the journal Geology. Researchers investigated the theory for the Great Dying that volcanic eruptions in the Siberian Traps triggered a cascade of environmental events. They believe sulphur emissions were significant enough to create widespread acid rain throughout the Northern Hemisphere, with pH levels reaching 2 . The eruptions may also have released large clouds of sulphur, which ultimately returned to Earth's surface as acid rain. Dr Black, who is the lead author of the study, spent several summers in Siberia collecting samples to measure sulphur and other chemicals preserved in igneous rocks. He used these measurements, along with other evidence, to develop simulations of magmatic activity in the end-Permian world. Together with researchers from the National Centre for Atmospheric Research and the Carnegie Institution for Science, he simulated 27 scenarios, each approximating the release of gases from a plausible volcanic episode, including medium eruptions, large eruptions and magma erupted through explosive pipes in the Earth's crust. The researchers included a wide range of gases in their simulations, based on estimates from chemical analyses and thermal modelling. They then tracked water in the atmosphere and the interactions among various gases and aerosols, to calculate the pH acidity of rain at the time. The results showed that both carbon dioxide and volcanic sulphur could have significantly affected the acidity of rain at the end of the Permian, which led to the Great Dying. After the eruptions ended, the researchers found believe pH levels in rain bounced back, becoming less acidic within one year. Geologists believe the boiling stew of magma from the ancient volcanoes probably released carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere, leading to gradual but powerful global warming.  A modern depiction of global warming is pictured . However, with repeated bursts of volcanic activity, Dr Black says the resulting swings in acid rain could have greatly stressed terrestrial species. ‘Plants and animals wouldn't have much time to adapt to these changes in the pH of rain,’ he said. ‘I think it certainly contributed to the environmental stress which was making it difficult for plants and animals to survive. At a certain point you have to ask, “How much can a plant take?”’ The researchers also modelled ozone depletion resulting from volcanic activity. Their results suggested that a mix of gases released into the atmosphere may have destroyed between five and 65 per cent of the ozone layer, substantially increasing species' exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Dr Black hopes palaeontologists and geochemists will consider the results as a point of comparison for their own observations of the end-Permian mass extinction. He said: ‘It's not just one thing that was unpleasant. It's this whole host of really nasty atmospheric and environmental effects. 'These results really made me feel sorry for end-Permian organisms.’","Researchers from MIT simulated the Great Dying, the mass extinction even that made 70 per cent of terrestrial vertebrate species extinct .

Bleary-eyed ministers began a final push on Friday to lay the groundwork at UN climate talks in Warsaw for a new deal to stave off global warming. Negotiators had worked late into the night to try and find some common ground on who needs to do what to meet the UN-backed goal of curbing average global warming to 2C over pre-industrial levels. On Wednesday, environment and developmental observer groups walked out, saying the annual round of talks had produced little more than hot air since opening on November 11, and was 'on track to deliver virtually nothing'. The UN climate talks in Warsaw will discuss how nations can help curb global warming, which is chiefly caused by burning fossil fuels . The conference is scheduled to close by 5pm today, but many are bracing themselves for another late night's work. Involving more than 190 nations, the negotiations are meant to pave the way to a pact by the end of 2015 to limit global warming by taming carbon gases emitted by burning coal, oil and gas. On current emissions trends, scientists warn the Earth could face warming of 4C or higher - a recipe for catastrophic storms, droughts, floods and sea-level rises. But developed and developing nations are at loggerheads over divvying up responsibility for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. Developing countries want wealthy nations to shoulder a bigger share of emissions cuts to make up for a long history of fossil-fuel combustion. The West, however, insists that emerging economies must do their fair share. China is now the world's biggest emitter of CO2, with India in fourth place after the United States and Europe. Another point of contention is money. Developing nations are challenging wealthy countries to show how they intend to honour a 2009 pledge to muster up to £62 billion (€74bn) by 2020, up from £6bn a year from 2010 to 2012. Hot topic: Developed and developing nations are at loggerheads as to how to help the Earth's environment . Still struggling with an economic crisis, however, the developed world is wary of unveiling a detailed plan at this stage, or pledging new short-term figures. The money situation also lies at the heart of another issue bedeviling the talks: demands by developing countries for a mechanism to help them deal with future losses from climate impacts they say are too late to avoid. Rich nations fear this would amount to signing a blank cheque for never-ending liability. The conference did not have many measurable targets, but negotiators and observers had hoped for progress on some of the most contentious issues, and a road map for an historic climate deal in two years' time. By Friday morning, with just over eight hours of scheduled negotiations to go, a draft text went so far as to 'invite' parties to announce emissions curbing commitments 'well in advance' of the Paris meeting where the pact is to be adopted in 2015. Scientists warn if carbon emissions are not cut, catastrophic storms, such as the recent Typhoon Haiyan, could become a more frequent occurrence .","More than 190 nations have gathered at climate talks in Warsaw, Poland .

Ten former National Hockey League players, including All-Star forward Gary Leeman, claimed in a class-action lawsuit that the league hasn't done enough to protect players from concussions. The lawsuit seeks damages and court-approved, NHL-sponsored medical monitoring for the players' brain trauma and/or injuries, which they blame on their NHL careers. It was filed in federal court in Washington on behalf of players who retired on or before February 14 of this year and have suffered such injuries. Ten ex-NHL players, including All-Star forward Gary Leeman, right, have claimed in a class-action lawsuit that the league hasn't done enough to protect players from concussions, allegations which Bill Daly, the league's Deputy Commissioner, left, has denied . The lawsuit seeks damages and court-approved, NHL-sponsored medical monitoring for the players' brain trauma and/or injuries, which they blame on their NHL careers . The suit comes just three months after the National Football League agreed to pay $765 million to settle lawsuits from thousands of former players who developed dementia or other concussion-related health problems - and in an era when more attention is being paid to the damages of head injuries sustained in sports. 'The NHL's active and purposeful concealment of the severe risks of brain injuries exposed players to unnecessary dangers they could have avoided had the NHL provided them with truthful and accurate information and taken appropriate action to prevent needless harm,' the lawsuit says. 'We are aware of the class-action lawsuit filed today in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of a group of former NHL players,' said Bill Daly, the league's Deputy Commissioner, on Monday. 'While the subject matter is very serious, we are completely satisfied with the responsible manner in which the league and the players' association have managed player safety over time, including with respect to head injuries and concussions,' the statement said. Ex-player Rick Vaive, right, said on Monday that ex-players are now suffering from debilitating head injuries, while NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, left, claimed that his body have taken the issue very seriously for years . The player's class-action lawsuit claims that: . 'We intend to defend the case vigorously and have no further comment at this time.' The suit argues that the league continues to contribute to injuries today, by refusing to ban fighting and body-checking, and by employing 'enforcers' whose main job is to fight or violently body-check opponents. And the lawsuit accuses the league of promoting a 'culture of violence,' in which players are praised for their fighting and 'head-hunting' skills. Leeman, who played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Calgary Flames, Montreal Canadians, Vancouver Canucks and St. Louis Blues from 1983-1996, suffered multiple concussions and sub-concussive impacts during his career, according to the lawsuit. Since his retirement, he's suffered from post-traumatic head syndrome, headaches, memory loss and dizziness, the lawsuit says. In addition to Leeman, the other ex-players on the lawsuit are: Bradley Aitken (Pittsburgh Penguins, Edmonton Oilers); Darren Banks (Boston Bruins); Curt Bennett (Blues, New York Rangers and Atlanta Flames); Richard Dunn (Buffalo Sabres and Calgary Flames); Warren Holmes, (Los Angeles Kings); Robert Manno, (Canucks, Maple Leafs and Detroit Red Wings); Blair James Stewart (Red Wings, Washington Capitals and Quebec Nordiques); Morris Titanic, (Sabres); and Rick Vaive (Canucks, Maple Leafs, Sabres, and Chicago Blackhawks). In a statement, Vaive said players 'were kept in the dark about the risks of concussions and many of the former NHL players are now suffering from debilitating head injuries from their time in the league. 'Hopefully this lawsuit will shine a light on the problem and the players will get the help they deserve.' Earlier this year, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said, 'We have, on our own, a long history, going back to 1997, of taking concussions very seriously. We spend a lot of time, money and effort working with the players' association on player safety.'","Ten former NHL .

The rights to Elvis Presley's image, name and likeness - worth about $30million a year - have been sold . The Elvis Presley brand has been sold to the same company that owns image rights to icons such as Marilyn Monroe and Muhammad Ali. Authentic Brands Group announced yesterday that it had bought the King of Rock 'n' Roll's intellectual property from Core Media Group. It is also working with the founder of another company to operate Elvis's former home, Graceland, which is now a major tourist attraction in Memphis, Tennessee. The company did not disclose how much it paid for the rights but the Elvis brand is still hugely valuable. The purchase gives Authentic Brands control of Elvis Presley Enterprises, which manages the licensing and merchandising rights to Presley's image, name and likeness, which is worth about $32million a year. It . also gives them control over a massive collection of music, photos, . movies, television appearances and performance specials featuring the . Elvis. As part of the . deal, National Entertainment Collectibles Association founder Joel . Weinshanker acquires Graceland's operating rights. Weinshanker, Authentic Brands and the Presley family will partner in operating Graceland, it added. Priscilla Presley, Elvis's ex-wife, said: 'This is an exciting day for Elvis and his fans. 'We look forward to working with the ABG team to further promote the legacy of Elvis. 'This is the opportunity the family . has been envisioning to expand the Graceland experience and enhance . Elvis' image all over the world.' Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, says she will continue to own the Graceland home and the original items inside it. Elvis's ex-wfe Priscilla Presley, left, and daughter Lisa Marie said the deal will help them expand Graceland . The family have retained control over Graceland, which is the second most visited private home in the U.S. after the White House . 'The . licensing and merchandising aspect of this business is not to be . confused with the fact that the property will always remain with me and . my family,' Lisa Marie Presley said. Authentic Brands Group has also bought the brand rights to Muhammad Ali. The . deal, which includes a vast library of photos and videos of the boxer, . also includes trademarked phrases, 'Float Like A Butterfly, Sting Like A . Bee', 'Thrilla in Manila', and 'Greatest Of All Time'. In 2005, entertainment company CKX, which later became Core Media, bought an 85 per cent stake in Elvis Presley Enterprises from the trust of Lisa Marie Presley for a reported $114million. Elvis earned an estimated $100million during his lifetime but had just a fraction of that when he died . Some Elvis fans reacted angrily to the 2005 sale and accused the family of trying to sell for maximum profit while his core fanbase is still alive. ElvisPresleyNews said the timing of the deal was in light of that 'visitations to Graceland may continue to slow down with the aging of the ""50s generation of rock 'n' roll fans.""' Elvis Presley died at age 42 in Memphis on August 16, 1977 and five years later the Graceland home was opened for tours. At the time of his death he had approximately $5million in the bank. However, he earned an estimated $100million during his lifetime. Colonel . Tom Parker earned 50 per cent of the King's income as his manager. His . involvement in the Presley estate ended in 1980, after a judge ruled . that all income should be paid directly into Lisa-Marie Presley's trust. The company, which already handles the image of Marilyn Monroe, also bought the Muhammad Ali brand, including the trademark to 'Float Like A Butterfly, Sting Like A Bee' He was particularly critized for selling the rights to Elvis's back catalogue to RCA in 1973 for $5.4million. It is estimated that Elvis has sold one billion records but his estate has barely benefited from his continued popularity. More than 500,000 people visit Graceland each year, bringing in millions in tourist revenue for its owner and the city. It is the second most visited private home in the U.S., after the White House. Plans to refurbish and modernize the tourist attraction had been put on hold, but both Priscilla and Lisa Marie Presley said a possible expansion of Graceland could be renewed.","Authentic Brands Group bought rights to Elvis's image, name and likeness .

If you've been struggling to shift the last few stubborn pounds in the run-up to Christmas, help could be at hand. Harvey Nichols' Beyond MediSpa have unveiled a new fat-burning laser called the Vanquish which claims to make a significant difference within four weeks. The laser treatment, which can whittle up to two inches off the waistline, is expected to be particularly popular with new mothers, many of whom are anxious to swap mummy tummies for a flat stomach like the Duchess of Cambridge. All gone: The Duchess of Cambridge shows off her flat stomach while playing volleyball during a visit . The Duchess sparked headlines back in October when she showed off a noticeably trim stomach while joining young volleyball players at Copper Box at the former Olympic Park. Shortly afterwards, it was revealed that demand for fat-busting treatments shot up in subsequent weeks, with one Harley Street clinic reporting a staggering 650 per cent rise. A spokesperson at the LoveLite Harley Street clinic said: 'We started receiving an unprecedented number of calls last Friday for tummy treatments and almost all were from mothers who had recently given birth. We normally make about 12 new bookings a week, but in less than two days we had 40. 'The phone was ringing off the hook and there were quite a few bookings left on voicemail over the weekend and the bookings have continued at the rate of about 10 a day all through this week. 'We usually ask callers what prompted them to seek out the treatment and on Friday and over the weekend almost all said they wanted to get a flat stomach like Kate's. Mummy tummy: Like other new mothers, Kate showed a noticeably rounded stomach on leaving hospital . Before and after: After four weeks of using the Vanquish machine, a slimmer figure (right) could be yours . 'Many said they had failed to get their initial figure back after three months - even with a good diet and fitness regime and now needed extra help to shift the stubborn fatty area around their midriff.' Although fat freezing treatments have proved most popular, according to Beyond MediSpa, the new device can target bigger areas and should work well on wobbly tummies. The Vanquish machine works by directing radiofrequency waves at problem areas which heats them up until they melt away. 'This new procedure is a real game changer— it's the safest, easiest way yet to remove fat,' saysPreema . Vig, Medical Director at Beyond MediSpa. 'As the panels . heat up, the radio frequency waves they transmit locate the fat cells which are denser and hold less water, and differentiate these from the . skin and muscle cells. 'The heat causes cell death in the . fat cells; some die instantly, some in a matter of weeks.' Although the treatment lasts just 30 minutes, the spa say you need at least two sessions to see real results, which could prove costly - each session costs £500.","Duchess of Cambridge inspired a 650% increase in fat-busting treatments .

In Greece, HIV carriers are entitled to a state benefit of 700 Euros per month (picture posed by model) Desperate Greek citizens are intentionally infecting themselves with the HIV, in a bid to qualify for benefits which are given to sufferers of the killer virus, a report has claimed. A World Health Organization report has revealed what it calls a 'significant rise' in the number of sufferers between 2007 and 2009, when the European financial crisis brought the country's economy to its knees. The number of reported new infections then continued to soar, from 22 in 2010 to 245 in 2011, . according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Shockingly, the research said around half of new cases could be self-inflicted by drug addicts who want to cash in on welfare handouts. In Greece, HIV carriers are entitled to a state benefit of €700 (£590) per month as well as access to drug substitution programmes which can help battle the illness. A European Union-funded injection site, the first of its kind in Greece, has also been opened in a run-down part of . central Athens in October this year. Addicts are paid small sums of money for . visiting the facility and providing data for anonymous surveys, as well . as returning to pick up their HIV test results. The WHO report cited a piece of work by the country's Mental Health Research Institute in 2011 which noted 'the . well-founded suspicion' that some problem drug users 'are intentionally . infected with HIV, because of the benefit that are entitled to approximately €1,400 every two months.' The claims show the shocking effect of the Greek fiscal meltdown which is filtering down from big business and banks to ordinary citizens. A World Health Organization report has revealed what it calls a significant rise in the number of sufferers between 2007 and 2009, when the European financial crisis brought the country's economy to its knees . The report also found that the economic crisis could be related to a sharp rise in suicide, which soared by 17 per cent in Greece between 2007 and 2009 and then another 25 per cent in 2010. As the crisis deepened in the first half of 2011, suicide attempts surged again by 40 per cent. When the report was compiled in autumn of this year, Greek unemployment stood at 26.9 per cent. Despite the existence of a drug benefit being linked to rising cases, drug experts have urged governments to exclude drug-abuse treatment from austerity budget cuts. Austerity measures imposed by the Greece since their economic crisis have caused disturbances in country. But drug experts have urged the government not to impose cuts on drugs benefits, saying removing support networks could make matters worse . Thomas Kattau, a Council of Europe official said: 'There are alarming figures in Greece. So I think it's very important that vulnerable people are targeted for treatment.' Kattau said program like the injection-zone had been regarded as successful in Germany, the Netherlands and other European countries, as well as Canada. He added: 'The experience in those countries shows they don't use to the money to buy drugs, but things like hygiene products. So it puts them on a road to recovery. 'In the end the goal is to stop the spread of HIV-Aids. Every euro invested into drug treatment is an investment to public health and public safety.","Sufferers of the virus qualify for €700 (£590) per month under Greek law .

A father faces having his two children taken into care 8,500 miles away because the Home Office says he does not earn enough money to keep them in the UK. Barman Justin Tutt, 29, brought son Seth, eight, and daughter Leigh, five, to live in England with him after the sudden death of their mother in their native South Africa. But despite Mr Tutt holding a British passport and having another son born in the UK, under new immigration rules cracking down on asylum seekers claiming benefits, Seth and Leigh cannot stay here as they must be living in a family earning at least £22,500 a year. Because Mr Tutt brings home only £120 a week . and his fiancee is on maternity leave, the youngsters will be deported . in March and are likely to be taken into care. Justin Tutt and his children Leigh and Seth, who face being taken away from their father and put into care 8,500 miles away in South Africa . Justin Tutt lives in Burnley, Lancashire with his fiancee Claire Miles, their seven-month-old son Jake and Seth and Leigh. The Home Office says Seth and Leigh can't stay in the country because their dad Justin doesn't earn enough money . A South African social worker has now warned the father-of-three that his children could be at 'significant risk' because they are white and maybe singled out for attack. Today Mr Tutt, who lives with his children, fiancée Clare Miles, 29, their seven-month-old son Jake and Clare's daughter Kaitlyn, seven, in Burnley, Lancashire, said: 'People ask why I don't just go back to South Africa but I have nothing out there and I will lose my family here if I go there. 'Here I have got a house, a job and I am settled and I don't see why Seth and Leigh can't settle with us too. 'I am in a catch 22 but I will fight as much as I have to to keep my boys with me. 'It is impossible for me to go back. 'I just want to have my children here safe with me and yet I'm being told that they aren't allowed to and that they will be put into care.

'All my family live in England, I have no one in South Africa and no life there. 'All I want to do is keep my family here safe and together.' South African born Mr Tutt, whose mother was born in Britain, emigrated to the UK five years ago to find work and a new life after he and his wife Deidre split up. Seth and Leigh lived with their mother in Kimberley on the Northern Cape whilst he met Clare and she became pregnant with Jake. But tragedy struck when Deirdre died in May last year and the youngsters moved in with their great grandparents, aged 75 and 70, in a retirement complex. Mr Tutt said: 'They had to live with their mother's grandparents but that was only temporary because they are old and the complex is for old people. 'It made perfect sense for the boys to come and live with us in the UK but whatever reason they have been refused permanent visas here. 'One border agency person said we could bring the children over on my British passport and then apply for the children to get British passports when they arrived but another said we couldn't.

'The youngsters have been registered at school and at the doctors surgery. 'Yet I have been told that an appeal cannot be overturned, the Home Office don't answer my calls anymore and no one seems willing to help me. 'I have tried to do everything by the book but do not know what else I can do. 'South Africa is a third world country and after speaking to a number of social workers, one turned around to me and said that the children going into care would be the last thing I'd want to do. 'She said that statistics show that one in five white children are raped or killed. 'They become targets because they are different and the children can get separated. Justin pictured with Seth in South Africa a few years ago during happier times . 'They cannot go into care in a third world country which has no money or resources. 'It is very dangerous for white children in that environment.' Clare, who worked as a waitress before she had Jake, said: 'Surely it is your basic human right to be able to keep your own kids. 'We have been in touch with around 25 lawyers and immigration specialists but we have been passed from pillar to post. 'We agree with tougher immigration laws but Justin has a good reason to be here in this country because he is a British citizen. 'The children's great grandparents are at an age where they can't support young children. Despite holding a British passport (pictured) and having a third child born in the UK, the Home Office are trying to deport two of Justin's children . According to the Home Office UK Border Agency website a child is allowed to stay in the UK if their mother or father lives here and the other parent has died. One of the listed requirements on the site for settlement in the UK is if a 'parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom and the other parent is dead'. 'We have had a lot of sleepless nights. The children want to stay and are really happy because they are with their dad.' In a letter to the British authorities, the children's great grandmother Hannelie Hattingh, 70, said: 'It has had a terrible effect on the children. 'It manifests in their dreams as well as their every day lives. 'They can't understand why they are not able to stay with their father and his family. 'My husband and I cannot raise them because we are pensioners and therefore do not have the financial means. 'Our ages also count against us. These two children need a healthy family life, there is no other family to stay with in South Africa.' Lib Dem MP for Burnley, Gordon Birtwistle, said: 'It seems ridiculous that these little children can't just live with their father in the UK who will care for them. 'It is government policy that you have to be self sustainable hence the £22k figure but these are small children and would not be claiming any benefits. 'The service they would be using would be education schooling and the NHS and then from schooling it would enable them to get jobs. 'He is not bringing them to the UK for the state to keep them . 'We will be working hard to do everything in our power to stop these two young children being forced to go back to a country where they could face rape and child abuse.'

Solicitor Tevfick Souleiman has been jailed for ten years for his involvment in Britain's biggest sham marriage racket which let up to 2,000 illegal immigrants stay in the country . A lawyer and three accomplices were jailed yesterday for arranging 2,000 sham marriages that earnt them £20million. Tevfick Souleiman and his gang flew women into Britain from EU countries in the former Soviet bloc to marry citizens from outside the EU. Most couples met on the day of the wedding and needed an interpreter to get through their marriage vows. Some of the grooms were dangerous career criminals from Albania suspected of murder, drugs trafficking and money laundering. But they won a right to live in the UK because of their EU ‘wives’. The scam, thought to be Britain’s biggest marriage racket, ran on an ‘industrial scale’ for eight years. Jailing the gang for a combined 35 years, Judge John Bevan QC said their enterprise had been ‘an attack on the institution of marriage’ that drove ‘a coach and horses through the immigration rules’. He told them: ‘A heavy responsibility for upholding the rule of law rests with lawyers. If the public cannot trust the integrity of lawyers, who can they trust?’ Souleiman, 39, was jailed for ten years, while his immigration adviser colleagues Cenk Guclu, 41, and Furrah Kosimov, 29, received nine-year prison terms. Zafer Altinbas, 38, was jailed for six years and nine months. The Old Bailey judge added: ‘There must, as a result of this case, be scores of people in this country, many of whom will be imposing a wholly undeserved burden on the hard-pressed taxpayer. ‘It represents an attack on the institution of marriage itself, treating it as a paper exercise involving two people who cannot understand a word the other is saying and meeting, for all intents and purposes, on their wedding day.’ Cenk Guclu, right, tried to blame workmate Furrah Kosimov for the crime but was found to be part of the racket that created 'sham marriages' in order to obtain British passports along with Zafer Altinbas, left . Criminals would pay Souleiman GA, a . law firm based in North London, around £14,000 to arrange marriages with . Eastern European women. The firm created ‘touching love stories’ to make the marriages with men from Albania, Russia, Pakistan and India appear genuine. Brides were flown in each day on . budget airlines and then housed in a grim tower block before being taken . to register offices across the country. Following the marriages the women . would be paid a fee for their time and ordered never to contact their . ‘husbands’ again. Most would return to their home countries immediately. Last night a source told the Mail that the scam had allowed ‘dangerous criminals to operate freely’ in Britain. ‘We believe this to be the largest marriage fraud ever committed in the UK,’ the source said. ‘Some of them are wanted for serious crimes in Albania. Others are suspects in murder investigations in this country. ‘These are the type of people who are being allowed to stay in the UK. I fear this type of crime will only . get more prevalent when Romanians and Bulgarians are allowed to freely . live here from next year.’ Solicitor Tevfick Souleiman, left, was jailed for 10 years for conspiracy to breach immigration law by arranging the sham marriages and Zafer Altinbas, right,  pleaded guilty and was jailed for six years and nine months . The defendants, three Turkish Cypriots and one from Uzbekistan, used the money to fund luxurious lifestyles. They bought a selection of properties in London and North Cyprus and rewarded themselves with luxury cars. When London marriage officials grew . suspicious about the number of weddings the firm was involved with, the . gang simply switched to other parts of the country. Marriage applications were made to . appear genuine by enclosing fake documents including business accounts, . tenancy agreements and references. Forged affidavits containing details of the couples’ supposed courtships were also included. Cenk Guclu, 41, left, was jailed for nine years and Usbek national Furrah Kosimov, 29, right, was jailed in his absence after fleeing the country while on bail . In one dossier, Alban Spaho from . Albania described how he met his bride-to-be Petya Zlatanska while on a . day out with friends in 2008. The affidavit said: ‘We went to a cafe where our friends left us alone to get on with it. ‘Petya was a bit shy but I eventually . persuaded her to let me take her out. After three months I realised I . wanted to be with her all the time and asked her to marry me.’ Another client pretended he met his bride in a nightclub and proposed following a romantic Valentine’s Day meal. Nicholas Mather, prosecuting, said: ‘The arrangement of these marriages was a lucrative business. ‘Substantial sums were being paid to individuals to arrange these marriages. This was a cash business.’ The racket was uncovered after British police cracked an Albanian drugs and money laundering ring in London. Brothers Behar and Elton Dika had . planned to flood Britain with £900million of cocaine, but the ship . carrying the drugs was raided off the coast of Spain in 2009. They were jailed and investigations showed their marriages had been arranged by the law firm.

A toddler who was the only survivor of a car crash that killed five members of his family on a pilgrimage to Mecca has has attended a memorial service held in their honour. One-year-old Mohammed Eisa Daniel was hailed a 'miracle baby' after surviving the taxi crash on February 8 on a pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. He lost his parents, grandparents and aunt in the crash that happened when their cab reportedly hit a concrete bridge, somersaulted off the road, and ended up in a ditch. Mohammed Eisa Daniel, who will be two this week, attended the Jamia Mosque with his uncle Omar Hayat . Shaukat Ali Hayat, 56, his wife Abida, 47, eldest son Mohammed Isshaq, 33, his heavily pregnant wife, Bilques, and daughter Saira Zenub from Newport, South Wales, all died in the accident. Yesterday more than 1,000 mourners attended a memorial service for the five victims at a mosque in their home town. The family had been in Saudi Arabia as part of the Umrah, a pilgrimage to Mecca by Muslims at any time of the year. Only Mohammed Eisa Danial Hayat , who will be two this week, survived.  He was found cradled in his dead grandfather's arms and suffered just a broken arm in the crash thanks to his grandfather protecting him from the impact. Shaukat's brother Shazda said: 'He is traumatised, he will need lots of counselling. 'When something happens like this always in life be prepared - you don't know what tomorrow has in store.'

MPs Jessica Morden, Paul Flynn, AMs Rosemary Butler and John Griffiths, Newport mayor John Guy and council leader Bob Bright joined the service to pay tribute to the family, who had strong links to the local Labour Party. Ms Morden described Newport as 'one family that grieves together', while Mrs Butler said everyone in Wales felt 'the sadness that we feel today'. Mr Flynn said inspiration could be taken from the fact a young child was spared. Mohammed parents Mohammed Isshaq, 33, left, and pregnant Bilques Hayat, 30, right, both died in the crash .

Mohammed's aunt Saira Zenub Hayat, 29, who also died in the crash, had been due to get married last weekend.  Moments before the smash, she sent a relative a text message to say she was worried about how fast the taxi was going. The Hayat family were well-known in their home town of Newport, where Miss Zenub Hayat worked as a pharmacist and her brother Mohammad, the father of the surviving baby, was hoping to do a PhD in neuroscience. Mohammed's mother Bilques Hayat was seven months pregnant when she died as the family made what should have been a four-hour trip to the city of Jeddah to meet relatives. All of the victims were buried in a cemetery in Medina shortly after the accident. The Hayat family had made the 3,000-mile trip to Saudi Arabia because Miss Zenub Hayat was due to be married there. While they were there, they decided to make the Umrah pilgrimage.","Mohammed Eisa Daniel, who will be two next week, was only survivor .

Tragic: Ritchie Allsop, 13, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, was found hanged in December 2011 . A 13-year-old schoolboy was found hanged by his old school tie which he used to do pull-ups. Ritchie Allsop, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, had been arguing with his sister Skye, 11, before the death and his new mobile phone had ended up in a sink of water, an inquest heard. He retrieved the phone and tried to dry it out but was later found dead by his mother Lisa Brown when she arrived home from work. She described her ‘hyperactive’ son’s death as a tragic accident. A coroner ruled out suicide, and Miss Brown, 41, told the inquest at Sheffield Coroner’s Court that Ritchie was always ‘messing about’ and often lay on his bed playing about with the tie. She said: ‘I found out after the event that the tie had already been suspended on his bottom bunk. 'He often used to put his legs in it and his neck and mess about. It had been there for a while.’ She earlier said that Skye told her Ritchie used to play around with the tie ‘all the time’ and the girl had told him off over fears he would hurt himself. ‘The way I found him I think he's just slipped while he's been messing,’ she said. ‘He was hyperactive, he was continually talking about rubbish. He was interested in everything that went on and everything around him. He was just daft and silly and always laughing. 'Sometimes he would get stressed out and kick off but he was full of life. He had lots of friends. He would have spoken to me or his elder brother Jamie if anything was worrying him.’ She said her son had no reason to hurt himself, he had never tried to hang himself in the past and he had never spoken to anyone of self-harming. A 16-year-old friend of Ritchie said he had had just changed schools but never mentioned any problems with bullying. He . got on ‘really, really well’ but often had arguments with his sister . although they would soon calm down. He said the tie had been in . Ritchie's bedroom for about a year. Location: Ritchie died at his home on this road in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, more than a year ago . ‘He used to do pull-ups with it,’ the friend said. He had never seen Ritchie down or depressed. ‘He used to pull a face and look at me then start laughing,’ the friend added. Ritchie loved ‘messing about’ with his friends and family and would often play jokes on them. ‘He would play tricks and joke about,’ the friend said. Detective Constable Gary Henshaw, who . investigated the incident which happened in December 2011, said there . were no suspicious circumstances about the death. ‘There . were no issues at school, he was very settled in and happy and . outgoing,’ he said. ‘A child had posted an entry on Facebook saying a . bully was involved but it was just a throwaway remark. There was no . substance to it.’ 'The way I found him I think he's just slipped while he's been messing. He was hyperactive, he was continually talking about rubbish. He was interested in everything that went on and everything around him' Lisa Brown, mother of Ritchie Allsop . Police officers examined his mobile phone and laptop computer. ‘There was nothing at all to cause us any concern and no indication of unhappiness,’ he said. That day Ritchie had cycled to his father’s house with his brother and returned home to play games and watch TV before he started arguing with his sister about 4pm. ‘The argument continued and at some point Ritchie's new phone got knocked into the sink and it is assumed it had been damaged with water,’ he said. Miss Brown said Skye had been over to the pub where she worked as a supervisor at 5.55pm to tell her she had been arguing with Ritchie. She told her daughter: ‘Come on, we're going straight home.’ Skye told her she had knocked her brother's phone into the sink and Miss Brown went to her son's bedroom ‘to see what had gone off’. She found her son hanged. Assistant deputy coroner Louise Slater said there was ‘absolutely’ no evidence of suicide and she added: ‘I don't think we have established exactly what was going on.’ She recorded a narrative verdict which said: ‘Ritchie Allsop died as a consequence of suspension by ligature at his home. There is no indication how he came to be in that position and intention remains wholly unclear.'","Ritchie Allsop, 13, of Sheffield, had been arguing with his sister Skye, 11 .

But one woman has embraced her matriarchal role with open arms, after welcoming her first great-grandchild into the family. Kelly Baker from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, took on three step-children and their nine offspring when she married 68-year-old Bob in 2010. But the 28-year-old couldn't be happier with their budding family, despite her husband being more than a decade older than both her parents and her eldest grandchild just three years her junior. Happily family: Kelly Baker (centre) pictured with 68-year-old husband Bob, their nine grandchildren and first great-grandchild . 'It's so wonderful having a baby in the family,' says Mrs Baker, who has resigned hopes of children of her own. Kelly, whose friends tried to warn her off grandfather Bob when they first met, loves grandchildren, Chanice, Amber, Warren, Chloe, Toby, Kamran, Arran, Jade and Tahra like her own. Baby Layla who is just five-months-old is the first great-grandchild in the family. 'I feel like they're my own family, we spoil them rotten,' she told the Daily Mirror. 'Couldn't be happier': The couple married in 2010 . The couple who work together as cleaners met when Kelly was just 21, after the pensioner stopped seeing one of her friends who was also in her twenties. Having endured the harsh criticisms of friends and families, Bob proposed after four years of dating. While Mrs Baker has given up on the idea of having their own children, father-of-nine husband Bob insists 'never say never,' though admits the family is 'quite large enough.' Mrs Baker describes meeting her spouse's three children, the youngest of whom is ten years older than she, as one of the hardest things about their relationship. 'But once they had gotten to know me they were very accepting and we've since become close'. All 13 family members will spend Christmas together in a local pub for a 'huge dinner', the couple say. And though naysayers sometimes hurt her feelings with 'snide comments', Kelly insists she has proved 'everyone' wrong with her marriage that is as happy as she could hope for.","Kelly Baker married 68-year-old father-of-three Bob in 2010 .

It could be Britain's most expensive property collapse with over £6million worth of cliff top houses creeping towards destruction after of one of the wettest years on record. Residents who thought they had decades left in the 12 properties affected in Sidmouth, Devon, fear the crumbling coastline could give way imminently. John Radford, 62, who has owned 1 Cliff Road in the resort for 45 years is the street's longest-standing resident. John Radford has lived on Cliff Road for 45 years and lost 15m of his garden in the space of a few weeks . On the brink: Houses in Sidmouth are at risk after bad weather caused 15 metres of cliff to crumble away . John Radford feels 'trapped' because land slides mean his coastal home is uninsurable and unmortgageable . He says a pair of massive landslips in the space of a few weeks decimated around 15 metres of his garden - and that more major falls are inevitable. Sidmouth is part of the UNESCO Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, which is important for its sequence of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks. But the landslides which have hit the cliffs there look set to take an expensive toll. Mr Radford said: 'The houses here are unsellable and unmortgageable.The people living in them are trapped. Insurance doesn't cover erosion.' A scheme to remedy Sidmouth's receding eastern coastline looks to be two years from becoming a reality. Wet weather at the end of last year led to several major cliff falls that saw residents rename a cliff feature called Pennington Point as Pennington Cove because so much of it fell away. Retired solicitor Mr Radford said: 'Before the disaster of November I was reasonably sanguine and thought we'd get another 20 to 25 years. Swept away: Wet weather has caused the garden belonging to John Radford to crumble rapidly over six weeks . John and Chris Radford have lived in their home in Sidmouth, Devon for 45 years and are worried it will soon collapse . Cliff erosion at Sidmouth, Devon, makes the area very dangerous and £6million worth of houses could fall down . 'We could be out in three. The amount of garden we lost in the course of six weeks was more than in 12 years. 'They were catastrophic and certainly the two biggest falls I've ever seen. The difference between the end of November and a year before is absolutely astonishing. 'We are very lucky to be second home owners. I feel dreadfully sorry for people in the road, who are older than me, who are not. 'I'm worried about my property but I'm equally concerned about Alma Bridge and the town. We're getting to the stage where banks of the River Sid will be exposed and that stands between Sidmouth and flooding. 'It could be 24 months before we get a scheme. So much will have been lost by then.' Paul Griew, leader of the Cliff Road Action Group, said November's landslips had been disastrous. He said other residents in the street expected to lose their properties within around 20 years. 'Talks are going at half the speed that one would like, while the cliff erosion is accelerating,' he said.","Land owned by John Radford, 62, for 45 years eroded by 15 metres in weeks .

Engagements: Kate (pictured last month), who is around four and a half months pregnant, will return to work properly for the first time since before Christmas . The Duchess of Cambridge will be out and about displaying her blossoming baby bump starting from tomorrow with a series of public engagements. Kate, who is around four and a half months pregnant, will return to work properly for the first time since before Christmas with a visit to an addiction centre in London tomorrow, followed by a ‘royal away day’ to Grimsby, Lincolnshire, on March 5. In a far cry from her recent Caribbean holiday on the island of Mustique, tomorrow sees the 31-year-old royal visit Hope House, a 23-bed residential treatment centre in Clapham, south-west London, run by Action on Addiction, a charity of which she is patron. The centre treats women recovering from substance abuse and other compulsive disorders, many of whom have a history of difficult relationships and find an all-female environment a more supportive place to tackle their issues. Kate will meet staff and patients, all of whom are expected to have undergone initial detoxification, as well as learn more about the help they are given which includes daily workshops and one to one counselling sessions. She is not expected to undertake any more public engagements, however, until March 5 when she will travel to Grimsby. The town has been in decline since the 1950s, when it was the busiest fishing port in the world, but is still one of the largest centres for fish processing in this country. Unsurprisingly, she will first visit the National Fishing Heritage Centre, where she will be given a personal guided tour of the museum by a local trawlerman. She will learn more about Grimsby’s maritime and fishing heritage and have the opportunity to discuss issues  around the environmental sustainability of fishing in the North Sea – one of her father-in-law’s pet projects. She will then go on to Humberside Fire and Rescue Service where, as well as meeting the on-duty firemen and women, she will talk to young people taking part in personal development courses run by Prince Charles’s charity, The Prince’s Trust. Grimsby has one of the highest levels of youth unemployment in the country, with around one in three struggling to find a job. Downfall: Grimsby has been in decline since the 1950s, when it was the busiest fishing port in the world, but is still one of the largest centres for fish processing in this country . The Prince’s Trust is now offering 12-week schemes for teenagers to help develop their team-building and CV writing skills. As a result, three in four of those who complete the course move into work, education or training. It is the first time that the Duchess has visited one of the charity’s programmes but it is understood that she has discussed its work with her father-in-law at length. Her final engagement of the day will be to officially open Havelock Academy, established in 2007 by The David Ross Foundation, which serves more than 1,000 pupils aged between 11 and 18 in one of the most deprived areas in the country. She will also receive a tour of the school, meet an A-level photography group – something the Duchess takes a keen personal interest in, having studied the subject herself – as well as view the sports facilities and an expressive arts display. Kate will carry out all her newly-announced engagements without her husband, Prince William, who is putting off royal duties for the time being in order to concentrate on his ‘day job’ as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley, North Wales. Her decision to return to work suggests that she has recovered well from the severe pregnancy-related sickness, hyperemesis gravidarum, that blighted the early days of her pregnancy. Tour: Tomorrow sees the 31-year-old royal visit Hope House, a 23-bed residential treatment centre in Clapham, south-west London, run by Action on Addiction, a charity of which she is patron . After being admitted to hospital in early December she cancelled all her forthcoming public engagements, save for a fleeting appearance at the Sports Personality of the Year award shortly before Christmas. Since then she has only been seen officially in public once, when she viewed her first official portrait at the National Portrait gallery in London in early January, leading to questions being asked about her commitment to public duties. Last week she and her husband issued a statement expressing their ‘disappointment’ that she had been photographed by paparazzi wearing a bikini while on holiday with her family in the Caribbean.

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 11:42 EST, 18 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:31 EST, 18 February 2013 . An Islamic extremist faction has claimed . responsibility for kidnapping a group of builders allegedly including a British national from a construction site in Nigeria. A . group calling itself Ansaru issued a statement today claiming it has . taken one British citizen, one Greek, one Italian, three Lebanese and . one Filipino working for a construction company in the West African country. The group, which has been linked to the previous abduction of Briton Christopher McManus, warned that Nigerian and European authorities should not 'act contrary to our conditions'. Mr McManus was held by his captors for 10 months before he was killed when a failed rescued attempt was launched. The link will cause further alarm for the safety of those kidnapped in this latest raid. Radical Islamist group Ansaru - pictured speaking from an undisclosed location in November - have claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of seven foreigners in a deadly raid on a construction site in northern Nigeria at the weekend . Location: A British builder is believed to be one of the seven workers kidnapped from a construction site in Jama'are in the Bauchi state in northern Nigeria . Police said gunman attacked a local prison  in Jama'are, near Bauchi, Nigeria, burning two . police trucks, before targeting a workers' camp for Setraco, which is building a road in the area. They said seven foreigners working for Lebanese construction company Setraco were taken after the gang killed a guard at a site in Bauchi state in the north of the country late on Saturday. Bauchi police spokesman Hassan Muhammed said: 'The gunmen came with explosives, which they used to break some areas.' Ansaru's statement claimed it committed . the abduction 'based on the transgression and atrocities shown to the . religion of Allah by the European countries in many places such as . Afghanistan and Mali'. The extremist group Ansaru, pictured in November 2012, have previously claimed responsibility for kidnapping a French national and have been linked to the abduction of British Christopher McManus in May 2011 . Killed: Mr McManus, left, and Italian co-worker . Franco Lamolinara, right, were killed by their captors after Nigerian . troops and UK special forces attempted to rescue them. Their kidnappers have been linked to Ansaru . It is stressed that any 'attempt or . act contrary to our conditions by the European nations or by the . Nigerian government will' endanger the hostages, the statement read. The statement offered no conditions, suggesting the group would later contact authorities to make a ransom demand. Police and security officials in Nigeria did not immediately respond the statement. Ansaru declared themselves as a breakaway group from Boko Haram - the north's main terrorist group - in January 2012. Engineering: The attackers went to the Lebanese-owned construction site of Setraco, where they killed a guard and kidnapped the foreign workers, police said. The company's Facebook page is pictured . Boko Haram, whose name means 'Western education is sacrilege', has launched a guerrilla campaign of bombings and shootings across Nigeria's predominantly Muslim north. Boko Haram is blamed for at least 792 killings last year alone, according to an AP count. Ansaru's aims are unknown - but they have a different message from Boko Haram, according to Raffaello Pantucci, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. Foreign embassies have issued travel warnings over northern Nigeria for months. Abduction fears have risen in recent weeks with the French military intervention in Mali, as its troops and Malian soldiers try to rout out Islamic fighters who took over that nation's north in the months following a military coup. Last week, the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Abuja put out a warning following the killings of polio workers in the northern city of Kano and the killing of the North Korean doctors. ‘The security situation in some parts of Nigeria remains fluid and unpredictable,’ it said. 'They seem to disagree with some of . Boko Haram's strategies - in particular, they disagreed with Boko . Haram's tendency to kill Muslims,' Pantucci said. 'They seem to be more internationally . focused, they talk a lot more in global jihad terms and they seem very . eager to cultivate that side of their image. It makes them more . dangerous.' Ansaru has previously claimed . responsibility for the December kidnapping of a French national working . on a renewal energy project in Nigeria's northern Katsina state. Britain also linked Ansaru to the May . 2011 kidnapping of Christopher McManus, who was abducted with Italian . Franco Lamolinara from a home in Kebbi state. The men were held for . months before their captors killed them in March 2012 during a failed . Nigerian military raid backed up by British special forces in Sokoto, . the main city in Nigeria's northwest. Authorities initially blamed Boko . Haram for the kidnapping, something that it denied. That apparently . represented the birth of the group, whose motivations remain murky, but . whose threat is increasingly real for foreigners in northern Nigeria. Foreign firm: Setraco is an engineering construction company that has existed for more than 35 years and has 'played a key role in developing Nigeria's infrastructure', according to its website . It has been linked to Al Qaeda but there's no evidence to connect the two terrorist groups. In November, Britain's interior . ministry announced that a parliamentary order that makes membership in . or support of Ansaru a criminal offense. Last month around 40 hostages, six understood to have been Britons, were killed in an attack on the In Amenas gas field in Algeria. Some 29 of the hostage-takers died, while three were captured by Algerian troops during a special forces mission to end the four-day stand-off which began on January 16.

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 10:57 EST, 18 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:02 EST, 18 February 2013 . Questions are being asked as to why Russia's powerful missile defence radar systems did not detect the meteorite that exploded over the country on Friday morning. Almost 1,200 were injured when the untracked lump of space rock exploded over the Urals, with the debris narrowly missing a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city of Chelyabinsk. In the aftermath of the impact Russian politicians called on the world's powerful nations to urgently develop technology to spot asteroids and meteorites that threaten our planet. Scroll down for video . Flash of light: The debris narrowly missed a direct and devastating hit on Chelyabinks, which has a population of 1.13million, but nevertheless spread panic through its streets as the sky above lit up with a blinding flash . But with Russia having one of the most high tech early warning systems of any nation on Earth, many are wondering why the nuclear superpower was not able to detect the incoming object itself. Experts from the Russian Nuclear Forces Project have attempted to explain how the rock, estimated by Nasa to have been 55ft-wide and weighing some 10,000 tons, could have slipped through the net. It is estimated to have exploded above the Ural moutains with a force equivalent to about 500kilotons - nearly 25 times more powerful than the atom bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945. The group, which offers definitive information on the state of Russia's nuclear arsenal and intercontinental weapons systems, published an image how far into space the country's radar systems can penetrate. The Russian-based group claims that despite the size of the object, early warning radars 'never had a chance' - particularly since they were never designed to detect rocks hurtling in from outer space. How Russia's missile defence systems missed it: The radar fans of the Russian early warning system are plotted here on Google Earth, with the suspected trajectory of the incoming meteorite shown in green . Sun-powered lasers could protect Earth from any more asteroids judged to be flying too close. U.S. researchers have outlined a plan for solar powered space defences which could vaporise an asteroid as big as the one which flew past Earth on Friday night in 60 minutes. The same system could destroy asteroids 10 times larger in about a year, with evaporation starting at a distance as far away as the Sun, the researchers claim. After Earth's close shave with asteroid 2012 DA14 on Friday night - and the unexpected meteorite explosion which injured 1,200 Russians that morning - attention has turned to technology which could be used to defend our planet. Academics from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, have outlined a plan to destroy any before they can destroy us. They say their concept, dubbed Directed Energy Solar Targeting of Asteroids an exploRation, or DE-STAR, is 'a realistic means of mitigating potential threats posed to the Earth by asteroids and comets.' Described as a 'directed energy orbital defence system', DE-STAR is designed to harness the vast power of the Sun and convert it into a massive phased array of laser beams. These can then be aimed at any threatening-looking asteroids to destroy them before they can get too close. As can be seen from the image, and an accompanying Google Earth file posted on the project's website, Russia's radar systems ignore the Earth's curvature and scan fan-shaped areas extending past our planet's atmosphere. Assuming the meteorite followed a straight trajectory as it collided with Russia, with an entry angle of about 15 degrees, a project researcher writes: 'As can be seen from the picture, the meteorite was out of the field of view of the Pechora radar and it was below the horizon as seen from Moscow, so the Don-2N radar could not see it either. 'The Dnepr radar in Mishelevka might have detected the meteorite if it looked up, but it didn't - as an early-warning radar its mission is to search the narrow strip of space just above the horizon, which a ballistic missile would cross if it ever comes. 'They don't (and shouldn't) much care about anything else. These radars are not supposed to search the entire sky on a continuous basis - it would be a waste of energy and would decrease the effective detection range. 'An early-warning radar could see objects at higher elevations (up to 34.5 degrees in the case of Dnepr) and does so if it is asked to track a satellite. 'But you have to ask and since nobody saw the meteorite coming nobody did.' The researcher adds that the Google . Earth file also includes the fan of the Krasnoyarsk radar, built to . close the 'Eastern gap' in Soviet-era Russia's early warning radar . coverage, but that would have also missed the meteorite. So there is nothing wrong with Russia's . missile defence systems, the blog post says, and the reason the . meteorite was not detected was simple - it was not an ICBM. Shattered: The city of Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border, took the brunt of the impact, with windows across the city shattered and some 1,200 injuries recorded . Ice hole: Experts have been scouring a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk believed to have been smashed open when the burning lump of space rock slammed into the Earth . The researcher concludes on a positive note for the safety of the world, given the number of nuclear weapons still poised in the arsenals of both Russia and the U.S. 'It still leaves an interesting question,' the researcher writes. 'What happens if you see a 500-kt explosion on (or above) your soil and have no idea what it is and where it came from? 'I guess we know now what the Russians do - they would rush to upload their dashboard camera videos to YouTube.'","The 10,000-ton lump of space rock exploded with the force of 25 atom bombs over the city of Chelyabinsk on Friday morning .

A teacher who allegedly plied dozens of teenage pupils with drink and drugs and took them home for private bondage sessions has been banned from the classroom indefinitely, a hearing has heard. Glyn Adrian Bevan, 55, was caught with a cache of inappropriate photos of teenage boys depicting a decade of drug-taking and bondage parties. Bevan was a French teacher at Risca Community Comprehensive School, near Newport, South Wales, for almost two decades until he was suspended in 2010. Bevan was a French teacher at Risca Community Comprehensive School, near Newport, South Wales . He later resigned. Police raided his home in Rogerstone and found the photographs and equipment, such as gaffer tape and rope, which could have been used as bondage gear. They went on to trace a group of 26 of the boys depicted in photographs seized and found 10, aged 14 to 16 when the images were taken, willing to give statements. The veteran teacher was later charged with three counts of indecent assault on a boy under 16, all of which he denied. Bevan, who had suffered a brain haemorrhage in 2009, later failed to show up for a court hearing in April 2011. Police eventually tracked him down to the Forest of Dean where he was living rough. He was acquitted of all charges last year when he was ruled unfit to stand trial. A General Teaching Council for Wales (GTCW) hearing today found all the allegations of unacceptable professional conduct against Bevan were proved. Bevan was accused of creating or getting pupils from Risca Community School to create inappropriate or indecent photographs . They included claims of sexual activity with teenage pupils at his school upon which he avoided criminal prosecution due to ill health. The hearing, which Bevan did not attend, examined evidence alleging he engaged in inappropriate and/or sexual activity with teenage boys, including one or more pupils at the school. The professional panel, which sat in Cardiff, heard the allegations covered a period from September 1991 to December 31 2000. Specifically, they alleged that he encouraged pupils to visit his home, supplied them with illegal drugs, plied them with alcohol and gave them money. He was also accused of creating or getting pupils to create inappropriate and/or indecent photographs and indecently assaulting one or more teenage boys. Panel chairwoman Jacquie Turnbull said: 'The facts proved above constitute ""unacceptable professional conduct"", meaning conduct which falls significantly short of the standard expected of a registered teacher and seriously undermines public confidence in the profession. 'Mr Bevan's conduct is fundamentally incompatible with his role as a registered teacher. 'He posed a serious risk to the safety and welfare of pupils.' The panel went on to impose a Prohibition Order against him, removing him indefinitely from the register of qualified teachers. He has the right to appeal to the High Court within 28 days.

"PUBLISHED: . 12:11 EST, 18 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:51 EST, 19 February 2013 . A man who was late to return to his parked car by one minute because doctors were telling him that his elderly father had terminal cancer was given a parking ticket. Kevin Hodges, of  County Durham, attended an appointment at the University Hospital of North Durham for his father Edward, 77, who was suffering lung cancer. Mr Hodges was expecting to attend a routine appointment on November 20 last year to receive news about his father, who was admitted to hospital five days beforehand. Kevin Hodges was fined him for overstaying in a car park by just one minute after learning about his father's terminal condition . But at the end of the appointment, a consultant asked to see Kevin especially and gave him the bad news that his father was terminally ill. Beforehand, HGV driver Mr Hodges believed he had ample time to get back to his car and his parking ticket which was due to expire at 7.11pm. But as the consultant called him back he faced a wait and was left unable to get back in time. As he came to terms with the devastating news about his dad, Mr Hodges ran back to the car to put more money in the machine for a new parking ticket, realising it was on the verge of expiring. He had put £1 in the machine at 6.11pm for an hour's parking at Southfield Way car park in Durham operated by LDK Security Group, which is situated next to the hospital. But as Mr Hodges returned to his car, he was shocked to find a parking fine slapped on their car for £60 after he arrived - just six minutes after the expiry time. Mr Hodges says despite pleading wit the operator about the fine, they said he had breached the rules and would not drop it . There is a five minute period of grace on parking times - meaning Mr Hodges was parked illegally for just one minute. Despite pleas about his circumstances to LDK, Mr Hodges was told the fine still applied. Mr Hodges, 52, has since been fighting the fine and appealed twice against the charge to no avail. Mr Hodges claims he received a further blow when he first tried to appeal and LDK claimed he had parked illegally, blocking the main entrance for other vehicles and increased the fine to £90. However, this offence was dated December 3 2012, almost two weeks after Mr Hodges' parking fine. It is understood LDK accepted that Mr Hodges was not responsible for the offence on December 3 but refused to rescind the original parking fine, which was then increased to £120 for non-payment with 14 days of the fine being issued. Mr Hodges said: 'I think it's absolutely disgusting. They should consider showing compassion in light of why I was late back to the car. 'I didn't think I would be late, I thought I'd left ample time, but it was because the consultant called me back to give me the bad news that this happened. Kevin's displayed ticket, and the fine notice issued, after his car was spotted for overstaying by one minute . 'Then they accused me of parking illegally, which was not true, our car never blocked the main gate but they claimed they had CCTV which proved it. 'The date of that offence was December 3, so it definitely wasn't me. 'I refused to pay, it was the principle, but then I got a letter from a debt collection agency saying I had to pay within seven days, so I had no choice.' Mr Hodges' father, who was married to Frances, 77, died on November 29 after the couple took him home where he would be more comfortable in his final days. The former miner, who worked at both Metal Bridge and Whitworth mines, battled cancer after being diagnosed with leukaemia four years ago. Scott Brunning, the North East area manager for LDK said the fine would not be scrapped. Mr Brunning said: 'While I fully sympathise with Mr Hodges' circumstances, as I've lost family members through cancer myself, we cannot overturn the ticket because it was in breach of terms and conditions. 'If this was a hospital-controlled car park it would be different, but we have to act on the land owner's behalf, who we operate the car park on behalf of. 'It is not owned by the hospital. It is run by the rules and regulations of the land owner. 'There is a five minute period of grace after a ticket expired, but this had expired. 'I want to point out it is not a personal decision, it is based on the rules.' Mr Hodges appealed against the ticket through an ombudsman, but last week received a letter saying he had to pay £90 within a week from a debt collection agency. The car park is not operated or owned by the NHS, but is situated near to the hospital. He said: 'I've paid it now, but I'm sickened and disgusted. 'There's meant to be a five minute period of grace, I know that, I was just one minute over that and I'd had really bad news. 'My dad died just days later. 'I think it's a complete disgrace and I can't believe this company is allowed to operate near to a hospital. 'They don't take into account people's personal circumstances, it's completely callous.

"By . Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 15:55 EST, 27 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:41 EST, 27 November 2013 . Claims: Commons speaker John Bercow, pictured with wife Sally, said the scandal was a result of Westminster becoming less 'meaningful' Politicians abused the expenses system as a ‘displacement activity’ because they were bored by an increasingly irrelevant Parliament, John Bercow has claimed. The Commons Speaker prompted criticism when he blamed the expenses scandal on Westminster becoming less ‘meaningful’ rather than on collective ‘malice or corruption’. The scandal has resulted in four MPs and two members of the Lords being jailed. In a speech in London, Mr Bercow played down the greed of politicians, suggesting they were simply being ‘imaginative’. ‘The blunt truth is that the expenses debacle was a particularly embarrassing layer of icing on an especially unappetising cake,’ he told political charity the Hansard Society. ‘The reality in 2009 is that the House  of Commons as a meaningful political institution … had been in decline for some decades.’ He added: ‘The House appeared to be little more than a cross between a rubber stamp and a talking shop which had taken to collective activity such as the imaginative interpretation of what might be a legitimate expense claim – as much as an odd form of displacement activity as out of any shared sense of malice or corruption.’ But last night Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the committee on standards in public life, said Mr Bercow had ‘got it totally wrong’. ‘The expenses scandal looked to me like a deliberate attempt by MPs to overcome their grievances over their salaries by boosting their expenses,’ he said. Anti-sleaze: Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the committee on standards in public life, said Mr Bercow had 'got it totally wrong' ‘They had been given quite improper nods and winks by former prime ministers who hinted that while it might not be politically possible to increase their pay, it was legitimate to maximise how much they claimed in expenses. ‘This created a very disturbing culture which is nothing to do with boredom but a way to bump up their pay.’ Senior Conservative MP Rob Wilson, who has described Mr Bercow as ‘divisive and self-important’, said his comments showed he was out of touch. Changes: Mr Bercow also suggested reforms to give backbenchers more power . Mr Wilson, an aide for Chancellor George . Osborne, added: ‘The expenses scandal had nothing to do with . displacement activity and more to do with the fact that Parliament was . not open and transparent enough to the public.’ Mr Bercow suggested his . moves to give backbenchers more powers had resulted in a ‘Westminster . Spring’ – referring to the pro-democracy revolution in the Middle East. He . credited his own reforms for giving life to the ‘virtual corpse’ of . Parliament, suggesting more family-friendly hours and allowing MPs to . quiz ministers at short notice were the most important changes. ‘Far from being in the final twitches of our mortal life, the virtual corpse has staged an unexpected recovery,’ he said. ‘It strikes me that three factors best explain the resuscitation of the House of Commons over these past three years. ‘They are procedural change, fresh blood and the novelty of coalition government. The first of these is probably, on balance, the most important.’ Mr Bercow also called for Britain to use online voting in elections and announced the creation of a Speaker’s commission on ‘digital democracy’ to help politicians and technology firms work together. He said the project was ‘unpredictable, potentially anarchic’ but denied he was ‘stretching the nature of [his] office’ by calling for political reforms. Commons Speaker John Bercow racked up nearly £100,000 in expenses in three years – despite a grace-and-favour residence by the Thames. He charged £16,000 for chauffeur-driven official car journeys and ran up £63,000 on flights, including visits to almost 20 countries to lecture them on democracy. One of the car journeys was to the offices of the MPs’ expenses watchdog – only one mile from Parliament. He claimed £84.31 for the round trip. His biggest expense was £11,252.81 for a return business class flight for himself and  two staff to Canada, for the 2010 G8 Speakers’ conference in Ottawa. The huge sums are on top of £9,200 claimed by Mr Bercow in the past three years in his role as MP for Buckingham. He visited India, the US and South Africa at the invitation of their parliaments but British taxpayers picked up the bill.","Speaker blamed the scandal on Westminster being 'less meaningful'

A 25-year-old carer went into hospital with a nose bleed and came out in a wheelchair, unable to walk unaided. Megan Taylor, from Blackburn, suffered a severe allergic reaction to a drug which, she says, had been blacklisted on her medical notes. Ms Taylor has a blood clotting disorder and was admitted to A&E with a nose bleed but the bleeding did not stop and she became nauseous. Megan Taylor, 25, went into hospital with a nose bleed and came out in a wheelchair after suffering a severe allergic reaction to a drug she says doctors should never have given her . Medics at Royal Blackburn Hospital, Lancashire, gave her the anti-sickness drug Metoclopramide. Ms Taylor says they ignored her medical notes, which warned of a previous severe reaction to the drug. She says she now suffers repeated muscle spasms down her left side, cannot walk unaided, is unable to work and has spent the past month in a rehabilitation unit. East Lancashire Hospitals Trust, which runs Royal Blackburn, is investigating her claims. It has not admitted any error, but declined to comment while its investigation is continuing. Ms Taylor and her partner Craig Hodgson, claim her allergy to Metoclopramide was documented in her patient notes after a previous adverse reaction. ‘Distressing muscle or movement disorders’ are among the recognised side effects of Metoclopramide, while the NHS Choices website warns that ‘some people should never use it’. Ms Taylor says she was given an anti-sickness drug at Royal Blackburn Hospital even though her medical notes said she was allergic to it and had suffered a previous reaction . Mr Hodgson says Ms Taylor had suffered similar symptoms after being given the drug several years ago at the Royal Blackburn, when the allergy was discovered, although the symptoms were less severe. Her mobility and muscle strength gradually improved after that episode, and the couple are hopeful she can recover again this time. Metoclopramide is a treatment for nausea and vomiting and stomach discomfort. It also helps to restore normal gut movement after surgery. It works by increasing the action of the muscles in the gastrointestinal tract so that food moves more quickly from the stomach to the lower gut. The drug is not suitable for everyone and the NHS says 'some people should never use it'. It should not be given to people who are allergic to any of the ingredients. Side effects of taking the drug can include blood problems, breast enlargement in men, breathing difficulties, confusion, depression, eyesight problems, anxiety, dizziness, drowsiness, skin problems and raised blood pressure. Source: NHS Choices . The father-of-two, who works as a gardener, said: ‘The reaction to the drug seems to have killed the left side of her body and she’s having repeated fits. Last week she had about 20 fits or episodes in one day. ‘She needs 24-hour care at the moment and we’re struggling to cope. ‘I don’t think it’s acceptable at all because it’s a basic thing to get right. If they haven’t got time to have a look at your notes what chance have patients got?’ Ms Taylor was in hospital after suffering a severe nose bleed at the start of October. Mr Hodgson took her to the emergency ward, where staff struggled to stop the bleeding and she started feeling sick. She said she was then admitted and given Metoclopramide over the course of four days, despite the allergy being stated in her notes. Ms Taylor, step-mother to Mr Hodgson’s children, then remained in hospital for observations and began to suffer spasms and restricted movement. And according to the couple, medics . said she would urgently need to see a neurologist at Royal Preston . Hospital, who could diagnose problems with her nervous system. But they say this only happened yesterday due to mistakes and delays in the referral process between Blackburn and Preston. Ms Taylor now suffers repeated spasms down her left side, is unable to walk unaided, cannot work and has been in a rehabilitation unit for the last month - last time she had a reaction to the drug she eventually recovered her strength so is hoping the same will happen again . She was discharged to a rehabilitation unit on October 22, where she remains now. Mr Hodgson said: ‘Right at the beginning, the doctors in A&E said she needed to see a neurologist urgently, and we made numerous requests over the last six weeks, but they failed to come up with an appointment until yesterday. It’s farcical and we just seemed to be getting fobbed off.’ Ms Taylor said: ‘The whole experience . has been horrible. This has put so much pressure on my family and it . doesn’t feel like the hospitals want to help me. We are considering . taking legal action now.’ Ms Taylor said: 'The whole experience has been horrible. This has put so much pressure on my family and it doesn't feel like the hospitals want to help me. We are considering taking legal action now' The couple have lodged a formal complaint but are taking legal advice before submitting a second complaint, relating to the allergic reaction. Rineke Schram, medical director at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the Royal Blackburn, said: ‘We take any concerns regarding clinical care very seriously. ‘We can confirm that we received a letter of concern from the family on November 15 2013. The concerns raised by the family did not include any reference to the alleged adverse drug reaction. However, we will ensure that this concern is investigated as part of the overall complaint.’","Megan Taylor, who has a blood clotting disorder, was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital with a severe nose bleed in October this year .

Facing jail: Helen Hart, 45, of Redruth, Cornwall, spent £6,000 on hiring a private jet to take her from Exeter to Paris and back . A secretary is facing jail after stealing almost £400,000 from her bosses to fund a lavish lifestyle of private jets and sports cars. Helen Hart, 46, ran up astonishing bills including £5,990 for a return trip to Paris, £7,816 on a hotel stay in Devon, and £4,752 on tickets and hospitality for a Premier League football match. She also spent £31,368 on renovation work at her home. Hart was due to go on trial yesterday for theft, fraud and deception, but changed her plea to guilty at the last minute. In a barely audible whisper, the blonde secretary admitted taking the money. She also admitted using the company’s cash to pay her rent and water bills, as well as spending £2,000 on a kitchen, £4,985 on 48 bottles of wine and an undisclosed sum on shopping at Marks and Spencer. Hart also confessed to spending the firm’s money on luxury cars including a Porsche Boxster and a Range Rover. She spent £46,500 on a Mercedes, too, using money kept in her Coutts bank account. Hart stole the cash from PDP Green Consulting Ltd, an architectural and engineering firm based in Truro, Cornwall. After she changed her plea yesterday, the judge adjourned sentencing until next month and the case was not opened. The main charge was the theft of £380,000 from the firm between October 2005 and May 2011, prosecutor Jo Martin said. Hart admitted that charge, but on the basis that she only stole £190,000. The Crown said this was acceptable as it would not affect the prison sentence imposed. Miss Martin told Truro Crown Court that the firm ‘was still solvent’ thanks to the actions of the firm’s directors and belatedly the bank, but it would have gone bust without their intervention. Guilty: Hart (centre) admitted using the ill-gotten money on her rent, £2,000 on a kitchen, £5,000 on 48 bottles of wine, paying her water and Marks & Spencer shopping bills and even a court judgement of £2,000 . Offices: The money was taken from PDP Green Consulting (pictured), an architecture and civil engineering firm run based in Truro, Cornwall, where Hart worked as company secretary, the court heard . Luxurious location: Hart spent £7,800 on staying at the posh Bovey Castle hotel in Dartmoor, Devon . Trips: Hart spent money on a private jet to Paris (left) and on shopping at Marks & Spencer (right) (file pictures) Piers Norsworthy, defending, had asked the judge for an indication of how long Hart would be jailed if she admitted her guilt. Judge John Neligan refused to say but . told the tearful defendant that he would give her some credit for her . pleas, which prevented an expensive six-day trial. Tearful: Hart admitted using the money on rent, £2,000 on a kitchen and £5,000 on 48 bottles of wine . Hart, dressed in a smart black dress, . gripped her hands together as she stood for 20 minutes while the 25 . charges were read out and she answered ‘guilty’ to all of them. Mr . Norsworthy said Hart, of Redruth, Cornwall, who had no previous . convictions, had known for some time that she would be jailed. He said her mother was about to have . heart surgery, her father suffered from arthritis and her brother had . been paralysed in a road crash. Mr Norsworthy said she would like to put her affairs in order and say goodbye to them before she goes to prison. She was granted conditional bail . before being jailed next week. The judge told Hart she was facing a . ‘lengthy’ spell behind bars, but he would decide on how long when she . re-appeared in court. Afterwards Roger Green, managing . director of PDP Green Consulting, said: ‘Hart was very manipulative and . very good at covering her tracks.’ He claimed Hart probably stole more . than £500,000 from the firm. Hart posed as a director of the . company and took money which had been put aside to pay the firm’s tax . bill, but the court did not hear full details of how she stole the cash. Mr Green said: ‘She was able to hoodwink people. She managed to keep HMRC at bay.’ The first the firm’s directors knew . of the long-standing fiddle was when the High Court issued them with a . winding up order for £231,000 in May 2011 – and the fraud was exposed.

A neglected 13-year-old boy who raped a young girl for two years avoided a jail sentence when a court heard of his own troubled background (file picture) A ten-year-old boy repeatedly raped and sexually abused a seven-year-old girl over two years after becoming addicted to hardcore pornography, a court has heard. The schoolboy would sit at his home computer for hours scouring the internet for extreme porn, the court was told. After looking at the vile images he would play out his sexual fantasies on the young girl – which later developed into attempted rape and rape. The court heard how he committed sex acts on the girl between the age of ten and 12 when she was aged only seven and eight. Yesterday the boy, now 13, escaped a custodial sentence after a judge heard how he had been physically and emotionally abused as a young child. The court was told the boy was brought up in a home that lacked any ‘sexual boundaries’ and may well have witnessed his mother having sex. His mother was also aware that he was spending hours a day looking at  indecent images on the internet but did nothing to stop it, the court heard. The case comes just days after calls for more restrictions to online pornography following Google and Microsoft’s announcement they would block internet search results linked to images of child abuse. The Daily Mail’s fight to force the web industry to clean up the internet through its Block Online Porn campaign has led to concerted pressure on service providers, such as BT and TalkTalk. Now all 20million families in the UK who have an internet connection will be forced to say whether they want access to online pornography. Hundreds of thousands are already signing up to have it blocked. Mold Crown Court was told the schoolboy began accessing hardcore images on a computer from the age of nine. Referring to the victim, Judge Niclas Parry told the boy: ‘In fact what you were doing was using her to play out fantasies that you had been watching on the internet, images of extreme pornography.’ Judge Parry said the boy had suffered an appalling early childhood and had been subjected to physical and emotional abuse. He said the boy’s mother chose to ‘ignore that you were accessing for hours a day images of a pornographic nature on the internet’. The court was told there was clear evidence of very poor parenting on behalf of his mother, which bordered on deliberate neglect. The judge at Mold Crown Court in North Wales, pictured, described the case as 'extremely sad' Reports . showed this neglect had gone on for around seven years, during which . time he had also been abused by his mother’s partner. And the court heard that the boy’s home environment lacked any barriers to the adult world. The . judge said: ‘You may have witnessed your mother and her partner engaged . in sexual activity. You were brought up in a home that lacked any . sexual boundaries.’ The . court heard the boy, who sat in court with social workers and employees . of a children’s development centre where he is now living, was left . without support or guidance. Elen . Owen, defending, described the case as ‘extremely sad’. Reports . suggested the assaults and rapes were a way of satisfying the boy’s . emotional needs rather than for sexual gratification alone.  Judge Parry . said the boy could have been detained in custody because the crimes . were so serious but said he wanted him to be rehabilitated rather than . harmed further. The boy, . who admitted committing rape, attempted rape and sexual assault, was . placed on a three-year youth rehabilitation order with supervision, as . well as a residency order so that he remains at the specialist centre . where he is living. The . teenager, from Llandudno, North Wales, was also ordered to register with . the police as a sex offender. The court heard he was seeking therapy to . overcome his addiction. The . judge said work to counsel the young girl, who is also in care, was . under way but that it may take years for her to understand that what . happened to her was not normal. Over . the next few months all existing internet users will be contacted by . their service providers asking whether they want access to online . pornography. New customers . who set up a broadband account or switch providers will have the filters . automatically selected, while customers who do not accept or decline . will have them activated by default. The . filters will apply to all devices linked to a home wi-fi network and . across any public network, such as those that can be accessed from . shops, where children are likely to be present. Only adults will be able . to change the settings.","The boy, from the Llandudno area, began abusing the girl when he was 10 .

"By . Richard Shears . PUBLISHED: . 03:41 EST, 18 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:27 EST, 18 February 2013 . WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . A woman and her brother-in-law have been charged with the murder of a 20-year-old mother who was tortured and burned to death because villagers believed she was a witch. Janet Ware, 28, and her relative, Andrew Watea, 33, were said by police to have been responsible for burning to death young mother Kepari Leniata in the central highlands of Papua New Guinea earlier this month. The shocking death of Miss Leniata, whom villagers believed had used sorcery to kill the six-year-old son of Miss Watea, made international headlines and prompted a widespread manhunt through the jungles of central Papua New Guinea. Repeat horror: The attack took place in the same town where a young mother was burned alive accused for killing a child through sorcery (pictured) In dawn raids on a number of villages, more than 100 people were detained and questioned about the fiery murder – and all were released except the two who have now been charged. Provincial police commander Superintendent Martin Lakari told The National newspaper that the pair were charged after ‘intensive questioning’ of all those rounded up in the raids. Scores of people had gathered at a rubbish tip when Miss Leniata was dragged there, ordered to strip, doused with petrol and set alight. Burning tyres were thrown onto her body as she screamed in pain but police, who had rushed to the area after hearing reports that a ‘witch’ was to be burned were forced back by the jeering crowd. Miss Leniata was accused by close relatives of the dead boy of using sorcery to bring about his death. He had complained of severe stomach pain and died later in hospital. Villagers claimed that Miss Leniata had confessed under torture of using sorcery against the boy, but there was no evidence of this. Still alive: Sorcery and witchcraft are still practiced in remote villages in Papua New Guinea's highlands . Superintendent Lakari said that hours after Miss Ware and her brother-in-law were arrested, police charged a villager with the torture of two elderly women who were accused by locals of practising sorcery. The women, who had been tied to posts, were rescued by police shortly before they, too, were about to be burned alive. ‘We are not finished from here,’ said the superintendent. ‘We are continuing investigations into these cases and if any evidence or reports come in later saying that other people involved are still at large, we will also arrest them.’ The young mother was tossed screaming on to a pyre of tyres and burned alive after being accused of killing a neighbour's six-year-old son with sorcery. Kepari Leniata, 20, was said to have 'confessed' after she was dragged from her hut, stripped naked and tortured with white-hot iron rods. She was then dragged to a local rubbish dump, doused in petrol and, with hands and feet bound, thrown on a fire of burning tyres. As the mother-of-two screamed in agony, more petrol-soaked tyres were thrown on top of her. The tragedy unfolded after Miss Leniata's . young neighbour fell sick earlier this month. He complained of pains in . the stomach and chest and was taken to Mt Hagen hospital where he died a . few hours later. Scene: The two women had been tied to poles and were about to be burned alive when police arrived in Mount Hagen . Relatives of the boy were suspicious . that witchcraft was involved in the death and learned that two women had . gone into hiding in the jungle. After they were tracked down, the pair admitted they practised sorcery but had nothing to do with the boy's death. Miss Lanieta, they said, was the person responsible. The boy's family went to her hut at 7am on Wednesday, stripped her and dragged her away to torture and death. Pictures of the horrific scene were soon circulating online. The . Post Courier newspaper said the torture and brutal murder of a mother of . two ‘provided a photo opportunity for many of the onlookers, including . school children, who crowded around and took photos of the woman being . consumed alive by the fire.’ Police who rushed to the area were . turned back by the angry crowd, but were able to drive away with one of . the other women while the second has fled. Part of the culture: Sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea, which brought in a Sorcery Act to protect against attacks on those accused of practising black magic (file picture) Breaking the law: The criminalisation of sorcery has seen several cases of violent vigilante action against 'witches' and 'sorcerers' in highland villages . Sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea and is commonly practiced in remote villages across the island nation. The cost of a witch doctor revealing a cause of death or casting out an evil spirit is usually 1000 New Guinean kina (£303), plus a pig and a bag of rice, . In 1971, whilst still a colony, the country introduced a Sorcery Act to criminalise the practice. However the law has recently seen a rise in attacks on innocent people accused of black magic, such as that on Miss Leniata, and convictions by ‘kangaroo courts’ made up of of local village elders. As a result the Papua New Guinean law reform commission proposing to repeal the law. Last July, 29 people were arrested accused of black magic and cannibalism after allegedly murdering seven people in order to eat their brains and use their genitals for sorcery rituals. In 2009 a man was hacked to pieces by machetes after a ‘kangaroo court’ convicted him of sorcery. A firetruck which had been called to the scene was chased away by the crowd. Authorities and international diplomats have spoken out against the torching of the young mother, leaves behind two children, the youngest an eight-month-old girl. The country's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill had promised to bring the killers to justice. ‘No one commits such a despicable act in the society that all of us, including Kepari, belong to,' he said. ‘Barbaric killings connected with alleged sorcery. Violence against women because of this belief that sorcery kills. These are becoming all too common in certain parts of the country. 'It is reprehensible that women, the old and the weak in our society should be targeted for alleged sorcery or wrongs that they actually have nothing to do with.’ The U.S. embassy on the Papua New Guinea issued a statement condemning the ""’brutal murder’ calling it evidence of ‘pervasive gender-based violence’. ’We add our voice to those of Papua New Guinean religious and civil society leaders who have spoken out against the brutality inflicted upon Ms Lanieta,’ the embassy said. ‘There is no possible justification for this sort of violence. We hope that appropriate resources are devoted to identifying, prosecuting, and punishing those responsible for Ms Lanieta's murder.’","Janet Ware, 28, and Andrew Watea, 33, charged with murder of woman, 20 .

Going online: The study by PayPal found many customers were buying their gifts in the internet to long queues and check-outs .

The study, by PayPal, found 88 per cent of shoppers in Britain will log on for Christmas purchases, compared with 86 per cent in the US and 84 per cent in Germany. The UK was also ahead of Australia, Canada, France and Italy. Forty eight per cent of Britons said they would be doing all their gift shopping online, ahead of Americans (42 per cent) and Germans (41 per cent).

In the dock: Deyan Deyanov is accused of stabbing and beheading 60-year-old Jennifer Mills-Westley with a nine-inch ham-slicing knife in front of horrified shoppers in Los Cristianos on May 13 2011 . Horror: Deyanov made the claims on the first day of his trial at the Provincial Court in Santa Cruz, attended by both of Ms Mills-Westley's daughters, Sarah Mears, 43 (left), and Samantha Gomes, 38 (right) 'They direct how I act, sometimes they say kill, fight, hit, pray,' he said. He made the claims on the first day of his trial at the Provincial Court in Santa Cruz, attended by both of Ms Mills-Westley's daughters, Sarah Mears, 43, and Samantha Gomes, 38. Also at the court were Jennifer Mills-Westley's brother John Smith, 63, and sister-in-law, Julie Smith, 62. As . the jury was shown 'tough' CCTV footage relating to the attack, Mrs . Gomes covered her mouth in horror and stared into the distance. Giving evidence later, Mrs Mears said: 'All I want to see is justice done for my mum today.' After . watching the CCTV footage, Deyanov said it was 'a montage, a film' and . claimed that he did not recognise himself in the images. The defendant said he had been using crack cocaine and LSD before his arrest, but had no memory of living in Tenerife. Asked . if he knew he was in Tenerife after being brought there from a . psychiatric unit in Seville on the Spanish mainland, he said: 'I have . just found out.' Heartbroken family: Samantha (third left) and Sarah Mears (right), daughters of beheaded grandmother Jennifer Mills-Westley, arrive with other relatives at the Provincial Court in Santa Cruz de Tenerife for the trial of their mother's alleged killer . Business as usual: The shop where Mrs Mills-Westley was attacked was trading again less than 24 hours after the killing . Amateur footage: After watching the CCTV footage, Deyanov . said it was 'a montage, a film' and claimed that he did not recognise . himself in the images . Tackled to the ground: He also denied that he . had lived in Wales, where he was sectioned in the summer of 2010 under . the Mental Health Act at Glan Clwyd Hospital . Happy family: Ms Mills-Westley at her daughter Sarah's wedding . He also denied that he had lived in . Wales, where he was sectioned in the summer of 2010 under the Mental . Health Act at Glan Clwyd Hospital. Later, . the jury was shown two 'ham knives' allegedly used in the attack. Both . were 22cm long, and one was visibly bent and bloodied. Prosecutor Angel Garcia Rodriguez told the court of the moment the frenzied attack took place inside a Chinese-owned shop on Avenida Juan Carlos. Jennifer Mills-Westley was described by her family as someone who was 'full of life, generous of heart and would do anything for anyone'. The 60-year-old was a mother of two daughters - Sarah and Sam - and grandmother of five who was living life to the full in the 'eternal spring' of the Canary Islands. Originally from Norwich, Norfolk, she had worked as a road safety officer with Norfolk County Council.In that role, Ms Mills-Westley taught schoolchildren cycling safety training and she was described by colleagues as 'popular and well-respected'. She had retired and settled in Tenerife, where she owned two apartments in the Port Royale complex on the hillside edge of Los Cristianos. One two-bedroom flat was rented out while she lived in the other and had been resident there for at least 10 years. Neighbours described her as 'quiet and peaceful and always immaculately dressed'. With one of her daughters living in France and the other in Norwich, she enjoyed travelling to pay visits to her family. In a poignant tribute following her death, her ex-husband Peter told The Mail on Sunday she was a 'wonderful woman, a brilliant mother and I loved her dearly.' Mr Garcia Rodriguez said: 'The accused approached Jennifer Mills-Westley, who he did not know and who was shopping, attacking and striking her repeatedly with a knife in her back and neck until she was completely decapitated.' He said the prosecution was seeking for Deyanov to be sentenced to 20 years in a psychiatric unit. Witness Davide Balsamo, an Italian who has lived in Tenerife for five years, described the moment he stumbled upon the horrific scene coming out of a hardware store. He said: 'I saw a guy walking around with a head in his hand. 'I came out of the shop and suddenly I saw him come off the kerb, completely covered in blood. 'I ran up to him and hit him with all my strength using my motorcycle helmet and knocked him silly.'Asked if the defendant was the man he had struck, he said 'yes', adding that his hair was a bit longer now. Ms Mills-Westley, originally from . Norwich, Norfolk,  had been living in Tenerife after retiring from her job as a road safety officer with Norfolk County Council. Her daughters, Sarah and Sam, said . last week they will attend the trial to come 'face to face' with her . killer and hope to banish memories which have been 'shrouded by the . brutality of her death'. In . a joint statement they said: 'On Friday May 13 2011 our lives changed . irrevocably when we heard the shocking news that our much loved mother . had been brutally murdered in Tenerife. 'Now, . nearly two years later, we will come face to face with the man who took . her life that day and relive the heart-breaking details of the events . leading up to her untimely death. 'Going back to Tenerife not only is a daunting prospect but it will reopen our wounds. 'We . have to hope that justice will prevail so we can lay our mother to . rest, and remember her in happier times rather than the memories we . currently have - memories which are shrouded by the brutality of her . death.' On trial: The defendant said he had been using crack cocaine and LSD before his arrest, but had no memory of living in Tenerife . Drug-addled drifter: Deyanov was a drifter who had lived in Tenerife and Wales where in 2010 he was sectioned under the mental health act . Deyanov reportedly had a history of . mental illness which had seen him sectioned in the UK, where he had . lived, and in the Canary Islands. In the summer of 2010 he had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act at Glan Clwyd Hospital in North Wales. He . had been released from a local hospital in February 2011 following . psychiatric treatment, according to regional newspaper La Opinion. And . a Spanish judge had issued a search and arrest order for him before the . killing for his alleged involvement in a fight where he appeared to be . on drugs.

Concern: Experts warn that rates of the illness are reaching 'epidemic' levels largely due to rising rates of obesity (file picture) More than a quarter of patients taken to hospital for heart failure now have diabetes, a report reveals today. Experts warn that rates of the illness are reaching ‘epidemic’ levels largely due to rising rates of obesity. The NHS report show that diabetes sufferers are a third more likely to die from any cause within the next 12 months than all other patients. Heart failure occurs when the organ is too weak to pump blood around the body at the right pressure causing breathlessness and fatigue. It affects 750,000 Britons and around three quarters die within five years of being diagnosed, usually when the heart eventually stops pumping. Diabetes patients are far more prone as they tend to have higher high blood pressure and high cholesterol which both put extra strain on the heart. The report by the Health and Social Care Information Centre - which looked at the records of two million patients - estimates that 24,900 sufferers may have died too early last year. Dr Bob Young, from the HSCIC said: ‘This audit is a wake-up call. Heart failure is preventable and treatable. Every health professional should take note of how much more common heart failure is among patients with diabetes and how high the short term risk of death is.’ Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: ‘The finding that every fourth person admitted to hospital with heart failure has diabetes is a stark illustration of how we are facing an epidemic of diabetes-related complications. ‘We hope this report is a spur to action for both the NHS and people with diabetes. Given how much higher their risk is, it is vital that people with diabetes have their blood pressure and cholesterol checked at least once a year and that if they are high then they are supported in lowering them.’ Demands: Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, hopes the statistics will spark the NHS to act .","Experts warn that rates of the illness are reaching ‘epidemic’ levels .
