Premier League footballer Jermaine Pennant has been spared jail despite admitting drink-driving while he was banned from the roads. It was the winger's third offence, yet he has avoided a prison sentence after the judge accepted that he was 'depressed and stressed' after months of turmoil in his private life. The Stoke City player was more than . twice the limit when he got behind the wheel of his BMW to drive back . from Manchester in the early hours of April 29, a court was told. The £40,000-a-week winger, 29, smashed his £93,000 BMW into another car and sent it into a 360 degree spin after a late-night drinking session. Later Pennant said he did not realise he had been banned from driving and had only driven home after he had been dumped by a girlfriend and a clubgoer began taunting him about it, Trafford Magistrates' Court heard. Jermaine Pennant (right) arrives at Trafford Magistrates' Court in Sale, Manchester. He admitted drink driving earlier today . Centre of the storm: The footballer is forced to run through a hail storm during a break in court proceedings . He had already been convicted of . drink driving in 2004 then the following year was jailed for a . drink-driving smash, following which he falsely identified himself as . fellow footballer Ashley Cole. Today Pennant, from Sandbach, Cheshire, admitted drink driving, driving while disqualified and having no insurance. He was given an eight-week prison . term suspended for a year and was banned from driving for three years . after the footballer insisted he was a 'disciplined and mature person . who had now grown up'. Pennant had been playing football . earlier that day and had arranged for his estranged partner Lara Murphy . and their 20-month-old son, Trey, to come and see the game but they . did not turn up. Judge Khalid Quereshi said he accepted Pennant may have had 'pressures due to being in the public eye.' But Carol Whittingham from the . Campaign Against Drink Driving said after the hearing: 'This sounds like . a case of me, me me and of a man who gave no thought or disregard to . other human beings when he got behind the wheel of his car whilst drunk. Jermaine Pennant, pictured left with his former fiancee Lara Murphy, with whom he has a son, was dumped by Alice Goodwin by text message on the day of the crash . 'It's bad enough that he has . convicted of one drink driving offence but to be convicted three times . just shows how volatile and immature this man really is. 'People . like him should stop moaning about their life in the spotlight and work . with charities like us so they can see first hand the terrible and . tragic effects drink driving can have on people's lives. 'My . son was killed by a drink driver yet here is this man complaining that . he went drink driving because he was under stress due to his love life . and being in the public eye. 'He . needs to get his priorities right and he should at the very least have . recieved a short prison sentence and a ten year ban to make sure he . learns his lesson.' The court . heard how he had begun a relationship with another woman last year but . that 'comments made by the Press and on Twitter' meant it was 'doomed . from the beginning'. Mike . Stephenson, defending, told how an already distressed Pennant returned . home after the match only to find that his new girlfriend, Alice Goodwin, had left with . all her belongings. Pennant was said to be distressed after taunts in a nightclub about his recent break-up . He also discovered a text on his phone telling him the relationship was over. Mr Stephenson added: 'He was home alone depressed and stressed.' Mr . Stephenson said Pennant's friends invited him out and he ended up in a . nightclub in Manchester - but there were further problems. 'Whilst . in that nightclub, a certain individual in that club was making certain . comments about his former partner, very personal comments. 'I don't want to mention in open court with the Press here, but it was a very distressing thing they both suffered.' Mr Stephenson said Pennant's telephone then began to ring with people calling him about the comments and to ask him 'if this was true'. 'That was the straw that broke the camel's back,' Mr Stephenson added. 'All the hotels were full. He got into his car and drove home to a place of safety.' Pennant, who was disqualified from driving at the time of the incident, claimed he had 'no idea' because of a mix-up over his address. And he also denied any responsibility for the crash on his way home - and had not faced any charge in relation to that. Danielle Allanson, prosecuting, told the court Pennant's white BMW was in collision with a silver Audi TT, which was hit side-on and spun round 360 degrees. Mrs Allanson said the other driver's witness statement described him seeing a 'flash of white' with the other car coming towards him at 'quite a pace'. 'He believed the other car must have gone through a red light to hit him,' Mrs Allanson added. 'He . was confused and his car filled with smoke and thought it was on fire, . however he realised the airbags deployed around him. He describes . returning home and feeling pain in his back and was treated for whiplash . at the hospital.' Pennant was arrested at the scene standing near to his car and was . making a phonecall. Tests revealed he had 89 microgrammes of alcohol in . 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35mg. The other driver was treated in hospital for whiplash. Police were quickly on the scene and Pennant was arrested and taken to the local police station. The court heard he was convicted of drink driving in February 2004 and . given 16 months disqualification. On March 1 2005 he was jailed for . three months for drink driving and driving while disqualified and later . made history as the first professional footballer to play a match whilst . wearing an electronic tag. Then in April the year Pennant was convicted in his absence of failing . to identify the driver of a car involved in a motoring offence and was . banned again under a totting up procedure. But in mitigation defence lawyer Mr Michael Stephenson said the . footballer had no idea he had been banned from driving as a legal notice . had been sent to his old address in Altrincham and he had never . received it. Mr Stephenson added: 'Jermaine Pennant had a difficult and unsettling . childhood and his early twenties can only be described as wayward. 'But over the last seven years he has matured, disciplined himself as a . person and as a professional footballer. He takes his employment . seriously and has maintained the discipline required to be a . professional footballer.' Passing sentence the judge said: 'Everyone who drives a vehicle has to take responsibilities. I accept that it was not a knowing offence and he is to be given the benefit of the doubt. 'I hear what you say about his personal problems and have sympathy that people in the public eye have pressures and appreciate the pressures put on relationships but with that notoriety comes further responsibilities.' He told Pennant: 'You are the author of your own misfortune. I accept it wasn't a pre-planned decision to drive but it was your choice and no other. 'You are of low risk of reconviction and low risk of causing harm to the public. You are genuinely remorseful.' In 2007, Pennant began dating glamour model Amii Grove but went he beserk and was arrested after she dumped him upon finding CCTV footage of the footballer cheating on her. He was said to have 'taken revenge by destroying £200,000 of his designer gear'. He recently made headlines again when his Porsche was found abandoned at a railway station in Zaragoza, Spain with several months worth of parking tickets.","Pennant admits drink driving after ex-fiancee failed to turn up to watch match .

"By . Tara Brady . PUBLISHED: . 12:51 EST, 1 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:16 EST, 1 May 2013 . Convinced: Detective Hilton Botha believes Oscar Pistorius is guilty of murder . The detective who first led the Oscar Pistorius murder case has said he is convinced the Paralympic gold medalist is guilty. Detective Hilton Botha was heavily criticised for his bungling of the investigation into the murder of Pistorius' girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp who was shot dead in the blade runner's house. Botha was then forced to step down when it emerged he faced his own charges of attempted murder for a 2011 case in which he and two other officers fired on a vehicle in an attempt to make it stop. Speaking to Vanity Fair, Botha, who knew Pistorius from a previous arrest on assault charges, said: 'The only place there could have been entrance was the open bathroom window and we did everything we could to see if anyone went through it, and it was impossible. 'So I thought it was an open-and-closed case. He shot her - that's it.' Pistorius, 26, is charged with the murder of his girlfriend Reeva, who was shot after she locked herself in his bathroom in the early hours of Valentine’s Day. He claims he mistook her for an intruder. The prosecution says it was a premeditated murder, but his defence advocate has argued there is no evidence to suggest the athlete's account of events is untrue. In a dramatic twist, it then emerged that Detective Botha had been charged with seven counts of attempted murder. The case was previously dropped but he was charged again and Lieutenant General Vinesh Moonoo replaced Botha as lead investigator. Couple: Reeva Steenkamp and Oscar Pistorius together at an awards ceremony before she was shot dead . According to Steenkamp's friends, they apparently noticed warning signs leading up to the death. Pepi Dimevski, who tattooed the word 'lioness' on her ankle, said Pistorius' name was not good on the street. In the dock: Pistorius is charged with the murder of his girlfriend Reeva who was shot dead on Valentine's Day . While Steenkamp's cousin Kim Martin described him as a nice guy, but on one occasion, when Pistorius had left the table, she asked Steenkamp if she was happy to which she gave a hesitant response. However, close friends of Pistorius are still shocked by the event. Mike Azzie, who Pistorius calls Uncle Mike, said every time the athlete mentions Reeva he says he is a broken man. Earlier this month it was revealed that Pistorius will be allowed to compete in Britain this summer after a judge relaxed his bail terms to allow him to make money. Layers successfully argued that he should be allowed to travel abroad to 'earn income' while awaiting trial. The controversial decision clears the way for him to take part in London's showpiece athletics event at the Olympic Stadium. Although charged with murder, Pistorius has not been convicted of any crime and would be allowed to enter Britain by the Home Office. It is now likely that he will compete at the London Anniversary Games, which takes place from July 26 to 28 at the Olympic Stadium in East London - one year on from London 2012. Since his arrest the athlete has sold assets including a share in a racehorse and property.","Detective Hilton Botha was criticised for bungling the investigation .

"By . John Stevens and Richard Hartley-parkinson . PUBLISHED: . 08:42 EST, 3 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:36 EST, 4 April 2013 . When Sue Diamond bought this . six-bedroom property on the cliffs after bidding just £154,500 at . auction by telephone, she thought she had her dream home by the sea. But she had not viewed it or had it . surveyed before buying – and six days later tons of rock at the bottom . of the garden collapsed on to the beach below, leaving the house . precariously close to the edge. Yesterday, three years on, her dream . finally came to a crashing end when another huge chunk of cliff . collapsed, taking much of the 1930s house with it. A house that was bought for a knock-down price has fallen into the sea three years after Sue Diamond paid just £154,000 for it . The sea turned red after a huge landslide at around 9pm on Tuesdayb night that took most of the house down the cliff with it . The house has been sealed off for years after it was ruled to be 'structurally unsound' but that advice was ignored by Miss Diamond who was the highest bidder in a telephone auction. The neighbour's house in the background is believed to be safe from destruction . From a distance the vulnerability of the clifftop houses becomes even more clear with hundreds of tonnes of earth falling into the sea . So much sandstone fell 300ft into the bay at Torquay that the sea turned bright red. Miss Diamond, 59, a retired police . officer from London, had tried to sue the builder from whom she bought . Ridgemont House in February 2010. But the auction particulars had warned . buyers the house was severely structurally damaged and might be beyond . economic repair, and a judge ordered her to pay what she owed. The cliff fall in Devon is the latest around the British coast following strong winds, high tides and months of heavy rain. In East Anglia, the fast receding coastline has been severely damaged. At Hopton, Norfolk, sea defences have been breached, cliff paths destroyed and a number of properties left vulnerable. The biggest cliff fall at the resort has seen a massive chunk of the coastline destroyed. The huge house seemed too good to be true at such a cheap price with more than enough room and beautiful views across the sea . February 2013: The house fell down slowly as the shifting earth under its foundations warped it and pulled the walls and floors in all directions . But this was the scene just three years later when the land started falling from underneath it and into the sea below . Holidaymakers staying in caravans . overlooking the sea reported hearing a crash like thunder as the cliff . crumbled into the sea. Three caravans had to be moved after they were . left within feet of the cliff edge. Part of a footpath that led down to the beach was swept away. Brian Hardisty, the chairman of Hopton . Coastal Action Group, said: ‘The coastline has deteriorated greatly in . just the last two weeks. ‘The high winds combined with high tides mean that it is just disappearing. ‘The beach has lost so much sand, which means the sea defences have become weakened allowing the sea to hit the cliff. ‘The cliff has been slowly eroding, . but this is the first time there has been a big fall right from the top . to the bottom of the cliff.’ All that is now left is a couple of rooms in the house with the bulk of it strewn down the cliff along with the gardens of the house . Mike Page, a pilot photographer, has taken pictures of the coast along East Anglia charting the places where the coastal erosion is happening. The images show caravans that are now just feet away from the cliff edge at Easton Bavents, near Southwold, Suffolk, and are increasingly at risk of toppling over on to the sands below. Nearby Covehithe has also been blasted by wind-driven seas, with salt-killed trees left uprooted and strewn along the beach. Further up at the coast at Hopton, near Lowestoft, the damage is even worse, with defences breached and cliff paths destroyed, leaving more and more properties vulnerable. Gary Watson, Norfolk and Suffolk coastal engineer with the Environment Agency, said easterly winds were partly to blame for the erosion. Mr Watson said: 'Over the last two weeks we have had persistent easterlies coming in, some of them quite strong. These tend to scour some beaches away. As a result we have recorded very low beach levels. That's what we would mainly see in the winter.' Caravans have been removed from their pitches close to the edge of a cliff that has fallen away despite sea defences . These houses have also been abandoned due to their precarious position on the edge of the cliffs of Easton Bavents . He said that by now beaches should be . rebuilding after the annual winter battering and giving crucial . protection to the coastline. But . the freak icy spell, months of sub-zero temperatures and killer North . Sea winds had almost bludgeoned exposed beaches into submission. 'Once . we get out of these easterlies we should start seeing calmer conditions . and more constructive waves that will push sand back up the beach,' said Mr Watson. He said responsibility for managing the stretch of coastline lay with Waveney District Council. The authority is now working with the Environment Agency to monitor the deepening crisis. But . Suffolk's Shoreline Management Plan (SMP), which sets out how the coast . will be protected, has outlined a policy of 'no active intervention' for the hamlets of Benacre and Covehithe. As . a result, defences will not be provided or maintained and the sea and . winds will continue to take huge chunks out of the rapidly-disappearing . coastline. A large section of Hopton sea wall collapses into the sea, speeding up the problem of coastal erosion . Dead trees are uprooted and strewn along the beach after the sea claimed yet more or the land because of the extended cold period .","Sue Diamond bought Ridgemont House in a telephone auction without carrying out structural survey .

Keen sportsman Dominic Elliott, 23, had worked for the artist for two years before his unexplained death in March. Family said Hockney, 75, was 'like a father' to the young man. Speaking for the first time since his assistant's death, he admitted he had stopped work in the middle of creating five sets of five drawings of the progression of the seasons around his home in Bridlington, East Yorkshire. 'Very upset': Artist David Hockney (left) could not work after his assistant Dominic Elliot (right) died suddenly . He said he found himself unable to draw for around a month and even considered moving back to California, where he had lived for many years before returning to his Yorkshire birthplace. He told The Guardian: 'I finished the first set in January. I . was very pleased with them. The . intention was to go back to them whenever the spring occurred. But then . Dominic died. 'It was an awful time and I was very upset. I thought I . might not do it at all this year. I thought I might go back to LA for a . bit. I didn't quite know what to do.' No 'obvious natural causes' were found for Mr Elliott's death in a post mortem examination. An inquest has been opened and adjourned until August. The assistant had been helping the artist prepare for his work on the seasons and had also sat for him for a number of portraits. Muse: Mr Elliott had sat for the artist on several occassions . Landscapes: Woldgate Woods in East Yorkshire is a popular theme of the artist's work . Hockey said bad weather following the death compounded the situation, and it wasn't until it turned in late April that he considered drawing again. Another assistant, Jean-Pierre, insisted he restarted his work, he said. 'I wasn't doing anything much, had nearly . given up, and was still thinking about going to LA when my assistant, . Jean-Pierre, said I didn't really have an option - I had to continue with . the work, ' he said. 'And he was right. I'm not going to retire. I just keep working and that's what I think I should do.' The artist said he was 'still very sad' about Mr Elliot, but that he had got back into the routine of working, completing 21 of the 25 drawings he had planned. They will be exhibited in San Francisco in October. Hockney's work was given its most prominent showing to date at the Royal Academy last year. The 'A Bigger Picture' exhibition was one of the academy's most popular events, with more than 600,000 people visiting.","Dominic Elliot died suddenly after collapsing at Hockney's home .

Clifford Clarke, 79, died in his back garden in Clubmoor, Liverpool, on Saturday night. He had slightly burnt the lamb shank he was cooking for his evening meal so he opened his back door. But the smell of the food attracted two large dogs. One – a Staffordshire bull terrier . crossed with a bull mastiff, according to neighbours – jumped at the . retired hospital porter as he stepped out of his back door. The dog’s jaws clamped round one of  Mr Clarke’s limbs and dragged him to  the ground where he was bitten a number of times.

Ryan French died after being hit by the train on the Southend Victoria to London Liverpool Street line on September 18 last year . A 'popular' teenager was hit by a train after becoming worried about rumours circulating on Facebook, an inquest has heard. Ryan French died after being hit by the train on the Southend Victoria to London Liverpool Street line on September 18 last year. The inquest heard how the 16-year-old had become worried about rumours posted online about him and a girl on social media sites. He is also said to have told a friend that the only way he could get out of it was to kill himself. Coroner Yvonne Blake revealed Mr French’s concerns over the internet gossip before he was hit by the train at Rayleigh, Essex nine days before his 17th birthday. She said: 'He was worried about the rumours on Twitter and Facebook (to do with the girl) and was said to have remarked to a friend, ""The only way I can get out of this is if I kill myself"". 'The friend didn’t take him seriously and started to laugh.' The hearing in Southend, Essex also heard that on the day he died he contacted his parents by text message and said: 'It would be better for everyone if I was no longer here.' A post mortem found traces of ecstasy, cocaine and cannabis in Ryan’s system, but these were unlikely to have affected him at the time of his death. The teenager - who had left his comprehensive school after his GCSEs - was a regular cannabis user, the inquest heard. He had also been close to his grandparents, and his grandfather passed away two months before he died, it was said. Ms Blake said to his mother Karen: 'You . were worried about the message and told him not to do anything, and that . you were always available, you spoke to his friends who told you that . he seemed okay.' Coroner Yvonne Blake revealed Mr French¿s concerns over the internet gossip before he was hit by the train at Rayleigh, Essex nine days before his 17th birthday . Friends and relatives of Ryan French left tributes to the talented young footballer who was about to turn 17 . He had once previously threatened to take his own life, but had been described by friends as 'a genuinely happy person who liked making friends and generally having a good time.' Ms Blake told Mr French’s mother, father, brother and sister: 'It’s a very sad day for you, I wish to send my truly sincere condolences.' Ryan, who lived in Rayleigh, was a keen footballer who played for Downhall and Rayleigh Boys FC. After his death around 30 people walked 17 miles from Rayleigh train station to Southend seafront and back in his memory and to raise money for a memorial bench in King George’s playing field, where the teenager used to frequent.

A photographer who shot a series of iconic Second World War images after serving with an elite Navy unit, has died aged 94. Wayne Miller also spent the years after the conflict chronicling the lives of black Americans in Chicago. His best-known wartime photograph . shows a wounded pilot being pulled from a downed fighter plane - an aircraft Miller himself had been scheduled to be aboard before it was shot down. The photographer who took his place was killed. Photographer Wayne Miller produced some of the most indelible images of World War II. In this, a wounded pilot is pulled from a downed fighter plane on November 5th, 1943. Miller had been scheduled to be aboard the plane before it was shot down . Navy Hellcat pilots cross the flight deck of the USS Saratoga and head for their planes just before the Japanese on Rabaul were hit a smashing blow. Miller took the images while with the military unit assigned to document the conflict . Hiroshima, Japan --- A tree stripped of its leaves stands amid rubble and the shells of buildings after the atomic blast that destroyed Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 . Miller was also known for his work as a curator on an international photojournalism exhibition called 'The Family of Man' and for contributing the photos to Dr. Benjamin Spock's 'A Baby's First Year.' He had lived in Orinda for six decades and become ill only in the last weeks of his life, his granddaughter Inga Miller said. Born in Chicago, Miller trained for a career in banking but became a photographer when famed fashion photographer Edward Steichen picked him to be part of the military unit assigned to document the war. While assigned to the Pacific theatre, he took some of the first pictures of the atomic bomb-devastated Hiroshima.

This image, shows children sitting in the streets of Naples, Italy, July, 1944 . After returning home to Chicago, Miller spent two years in the late 1940s on the city's south side capturing the experiences of black residents, many of whom had moved north during the war in search of jobs and the promise of civil rights. The originals from his 'The Way of the Northern Negro' series are now held in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Museum and the Smithsonian Institution.'He was tired of what a good job photography was doing of showing the way we were destroying each other and he decided to come back and have the medium connect people in a more meaningful fashion,' said Paul Berlanga, director of Chicago's Stephen Daitler Gallery. A woman and her squatter's shack, built of cardboard and plywood on Lake Michigan's beach on a cold winter day in 1948. Miller returned home to his native Chicago and spent two years on the city's South Side capturing the experiences of black residents . 'He wanted to bring the white and black races together, and thought to make a photo documentary to introduce black Chicago to white Chicago and to white America.' While he mostly turned his lens on ordinary Americans, his subjects for the series included emerging stars such as Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington and Eartha Kitt. During the early 1950s, Miller reunited with Steichen in putting together 'The Family of Man,' a Museum of Modern Art exhibit featuring hundreds of portraits by photographers from all over the world. While Miller stopped working as a professional photographer in the mid-1970s, he discovered a passion for the preservation of California's redwood forests . A book of the same name based on the exhibit sold more than four million copies. An iconic photograph of Miller's that was part of the exhibit showed his son David being delivered as a baby by his grandfather. It was included in a phonographic time capsule Carl Sagan put together that was launched with the Voyager spacecraft in the late 1970s. Miller also produced an intimate book of his photography called 'The World is Young.' He spent the next several decades as a photojournalist for Life, Ebony, the Saturday Evening Post and other magazines. For six years, he was president of Magnum Photos, a photographer's cooperative. Magnum's current president, Alex Majoli, praised Miller as a pioneer who 'paved the ground for the rest of us who tried to depict the streets, the real life.' 'It might have seemed like golden years for photographers now, but he had to invent himself in many ways, a character trait I highly appreciate in people,' Majoli said. Miller stopped working as a professional photographer in the mid-1970s, but he found a new passion crusading for the preservation of California's redwood forests. He and his wife, Joan, restored a clear-cut patch of forest and helped lobby for the passage of laws that provided incentives for landowners to protect rather than log trees.

The FBI has released photos of three individuals wanted for questioning in last year's deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya in a worldwide plea for information in the case. The men were seen on the grounds of the consulate building on the day of the terror strike in Benghazi, and may have information that could aid the federal probe of the attack, which occurred on the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Four Americans were killed in the six-hour assault, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, information management officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.

Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack . In the photos released by the agency on Wednesday, each of the men appear to be holding guns. The FBI said in a statement: 'We are seeking information about three individuals who were on the grounds of the U.S. Special Mission when it was attacked.' 'These individuals may be able to provide information to help in the investigation.' Anyone with information regarding the Benghazi attack or the men in the photos are urged to text or e-mail the FBI at BenghaziTips@ic.fbi.gov or submit information confidentially at https://forms.fbi.gov/benghazi-en. Lawmakers and independent investigators have blamed the State Department for 'security failures' in the months leading up to the assault. Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday pledged full cooperation with lawmakers' queries into last year's assault on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, while his spokesman dismissed reports that whistleblowers faced retaliation. 'We're prepared to work openly and accountably to answer any of those questions,' Kerry told reporters.

'I'm determined that this will be an accountable and open State Department as it has been in the past and we will continue to provide answers,' he said. Some Republicans continue to assail Obama over security lapses, but also over the administration's conflicting early accounts of what happened. On Tuesday, two senior Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona, reiterated their call for the Senate to set up a joint select committee to investigate the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack. 'Revelations about witnesses being afraid to testify and military assets that could have been deployed in a timely fashion justify appointing a joint select committee,' they said in a statement. Burning issue: Ambassador Chris Stevens and . three other Americans were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack . on the consulate in Benghazi . The senators were apparently referring to a Fox News report on Monday which quoted a former Justice Department lawyer, Victoria Toensing, as saying that one of her clients and other State Department officials had been threatened with career damage by unnamed Obama administration officials. Asked about the report, Kerry said 'there's been an enormous amount of misinformation out there.' While repeating a vow to cooperate with lawmakers, he added: 'We have to demythologize this issue, and certainly depoliticize it.' Pressed on the allegation that would-be witnesses at the State Department faced threats, the department's deputy spokesman Patrick Ventrell said: 'The State Department would never tolerate or sanction retaliation against whistleblowers on any issue, including this one.' Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney added: 'We are unaware of any agency blocking an employee who would like to appear before Congress to provide information related to Benghazi.

"By . Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 03:10 EST, 17 January 2012 . Boosting vitamin D intake could help prevent deteriorating eyesight and . blindness in older people, it is claimed. Scientists said tests revealed taking vitamin D for six weeks could improve vision among middle-aged subjects. Levels of amyloid beta, a toxic protein linked to Alzheimer's disease and known to be a hallmark of ageing, were also reduced in the study. Eye test: By the time a person is 70, the effects of normal ageing can lead to a 30 per cent reduction in the number of light receptive cells in the retina . Although the research was on middle-aged mice, scientists believe it could have important implications for human health. Lead scientist Professor Glen Jeffery, from the University College London: 'Researchers need to run full clinical . trials in humans before we can say confidently that older people should . start taking vitamin D supplements, but there is growing evidence that . many of us in the Western world are deficient in vitamin D and this . could be having significant health implications.' Age-related inflammation and damage to the eye's retina can lead to macular degeneration, the biggest cause of blindness in people over the age of 50 in the developed world. By the time a person is 70, the effects of normal ageing can lead to a 30 per cent reduction in the number of light receptive cells in the retina. The UCL team injected one-year-old female mice with safflower oil containing vitamin D every three days. A mouse year is roughly equivalent to 50 human years. Another group received injections of vitamin-free safflower oil. After six weeks, tests which measured the electrical responses of retinal cells showed significant improvement in the vision of the treated mice. The better performance of their eyes was associated with key biological and molecular changes. Vitamin D treatment reduced numbers of cells called macrophages that play a vital role in the immune system but can also trigger inflammation. The remaining macrophages seemed to work in a more beneficial way. Deposits of amyloid beta in the eye were also lowered. Accumulations of the toxic protein are believed to contribute both to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer's. Amyloid deposits can also play a role in heart disease. Tests also showed that the vitamin D-treated mice had significantly less amyloid beta build-up in their blood vessels. This included the aorta, the major artery that carries blood away from the heart. Taking vitamin D supplements in the early stages of AMD 'may prove a very simple and effective route to limit disease progression', the researchers wrote, in the journal Neurobiology of Aging. They added that the vitamin 'may have a wider role to play in health and problems associated with ageing than in AMD alone'. Evolutionary history may explain the link between vitamin D deficiency and age-related diseases, said Prof Jeffery. Most human evolution took place in Africa where the ancestors of modern humans were exposed to strong sunlight. They would not have been short of vitamin D, which is generated by the action of the sun's ultraviolet rays on the skin. Humans only started living in colder climates and covering their bodies relatively recently in their history. As a result, people today are generally less exposed to vitamin D than their early ancestors. At the same time life expectancy has increased greatly, bringing a greater disease burden. Professor Douglas Kell, chief executive of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council which funded the study, said: 'Many people are living to an unprecedented old age in the developed world. All too often though, a long life does not mean a healthy one and the lives of many older people are blighted by ill health as parts of their bodies start to malfunction. 'If we are to have any hope of ensuring that more people can enjoy a healthy, productive retirement then we must learn more about the changes that take place as animals age. 'This research shows how close study of one part of the body can lead scientists to discover new knowledge that is more widely applicable. By studying the fundamental biology of one organ scientists can begin to draw links between a number of diseases in the hope of developing preventive strategies.'","Deposits of toxic protein linked to age-related macular degeneration and Alzheimer's also lowered in test subjects .

The curvaceous figure which prompted outrage from viewers is covered by her demure wedding dress and as she leans forward to cut the cake, she beams like any other bride on her big day. This is stripper Keri Graham who yesterday blamed everyone but herself for turning Britain’s Got Talent into a sleaze fest. Mrs Graham said that her ‘classy’ dance routine was only made seedy when the ITV show’s judges David Walliams and Simon Cowell came on stage and prompted her to perform a lap dance. Scroll down for video . Demure: Mrs Graham with husband Gary on their wedding day eight years ago . The 43-year-old writhed semi-naked with one leg over Cowell’s shoulder after he rushed on stage, egged on by Walliams, following her performance and took a seat saying ‘let’s do it’. The married mother-of-one, who was on TV just a few weeks ago as a Las Vegas showgirl in Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway, also said responsibility for the public’s backlash rested with ITV bosses for allowing her act to be screened before the 9pm watershed. Speaking for the first time following the backlash she told the Mail that she believed that the routine she had initially gone on the show to perform was not sleazy. She said: ‘My act was actually more about strength and balance, using my core strength. It was a hard routine and trying to make it flow and sexy. ‘But then the tone got lowered when Simon got on stage.’ Mrs Graham had gone on the show to perform a dance routine on a chair to explicit song Freak Me, during which she took off her clothes to show her underwear. Fighting fit: Keri Graham insists her act was not seedy . At the end of her performance judge David Walliams told Mrs Graham: ‘I just thought wouldn’t it be great to see Simon sat on the chair and you doing the dancing?’ After initially seeming reluctant, Cowell walked on to the stage and kissed Mrs Graham on the cheek, before sitting on the chair as Mrs Graham gave him a lap dance accompanied by Walliams. Viewers immediately took to the Internet to express their disgust at the lap dance, with one condemning the show as ‘Britain’s Got Sleaze’. Yesterday at her £334,000 four-bedroom detached home in Chafford Hundred, Essex, Mrs Graham said that she had sympathy with those complaining, but said it was ITV’s decision to screen it at around 7:30pm, hours before the watershed. She said: ‘I didn’t do it to upset anybody. I do actually understand some of the concerns. But at the end of the day I did not choose to put that on ITV. That was for the ITV bosses to decide, I did the act, they did not have to show it.’ She claimed that she had made sure that her skimpy outfit was not too revealing. She said: ‘Seriously, there is more sleaze in a Carry On movie, isn’t there? Actual bare flesh, boobs and bums. It was all about a bit of fun. ‘I went to a lot of trouble with my wardrobe. I had my cleavage covered and wore two pairs of shorts, one over the other, to make sure everything was covered. It looked sexy but classy.’ Mrs Graham, who has been married to her husband Gary for eight years, said that she only auditioned for the show ‘for a laugh’ as she was taking her 12-year-old son Callum audition as a hip hop dancer. ‘I ran it all by him,’ she said. ‘I asked that it was all OK with him. And he said I am really proud of you mum, you have to do it. All his friends at school are very supportive.’ However, it is not clear that all the family were quite so unembarrassed by the performance. After watching the show, her step-son Seamus, who works for law firm Mishcon de Reya, wrote on Twitter: ‘Ladies and Gents, my step mum ... *hides*’ Her husband Gary yesterday refused to comment on his wife’s performance. It is not the first time that Mrs Graham has appeared primetime Saturday night television. She appeared in four episodes of the latest series of Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway as a Vegas show girl. During Mrs Graham’s performance on Britain’s Got Talent she was described on screen as a ‘housewife’, yesterday she admitted that she had worked as a professional stripper. Britains got sleaze.jpg . Mrs Graham, whose stage name is Keri Gold, said that she was not ashamed of her work as stripping is now ‘very common’, but said that she now only works as a choreographer for a burlesque dance troupe. She said: ‘Stripping is something that I did do, something in my past that I’m very proud of.‘When you become a professional dancer they pay you hardly any money, so I was trying to pay bills. I’m not saying oh poor me I was destitute and had to do it. Actually I had a brilliant time and enjoyed it. ‘It is something that is very common now, it is not something that is so shameful now. I did it and I do choreography now. I’ve moved on.’ Raunchy: David Walliams and 43-year-old Keri Graham gave Simon Cowell a lap dance in the family entertainment show . However, the Daily Mail can reveal she was signed up to the Colchester-based LimeLite Strippers Agency near to her home in Essex, and that she only quit the company two weeks ago following her performance on Britain’s Got Talent. A spokesman for the agency said: ‘Keri was on our books, but left two weeks ago. It was her on Britain’s Got Talent. I think her leaving was because she was going to be on the show.’ A handful of complaints about Mrs Graham’s routine have been made to ITV and around 30 to Ofcom, the media watchdog is currently considering whether or not to launch an investigation.","Keri Graham blamed everyone but herself for turning Britain's Got Talent into a sleaze fest .

The mother of a British man accused of drug offences in Dubai has told of his appalling treatment and torture by police. A Dubai judge is due to give a verdict today in the trial of Grant Cameron and fellow Britons Suneet Jeerh and Karl Williams who all deny the charges against them. Yesterday, ahead of a state visit to Britain by the president of the UAE, David Cameron told of his ‘concern’ over the treatment of the three men. David Cameron has spoken about his 'concern' over the treatment of the three men while in custody . In a letter, the Prime Minister wrote: ‘Our concerns about the allegations of torture have been repeatedly raised with the Emirati authorities, including by the Foreign Office and [Foreign Office minister] Alastair Burt. ‘The absence of an independent medical examination remains a concern. We continue to press for evidence of a full, impartial and independent investigation.’ The human rights charity Reprieve said the charges should have been dropped and the men - who went on trial in February - should be released because of the torture allegations. The three men, who are charged with possessing, taking and intending to distribute illegal drugs, were arrested on holiday in August after police said they found a quantity of synthetic cannabis known as “spice” in their car. Police in the country have denied any wrongdoing but Tracy Cameron described her son’s ‘terrifying ordeal’ and said she sincerely believed he was going to die. There have been allegations of torture, including electric shock and beatings, from the police in Dubai (pictured) She said: ‘They were taken back to their hotel room, they were beaten in their hotel room, it does appear they were separated from each other and each taken to a different room. ‘Karl was laid out on the bed, his trousers were stripped down and electric shocks were administered to his testicles while he was blindfolded. ‘I believe all boys had guns held to their head - they were told they were going to die. ‘Grant sustained electric shocks to his torso and I believe Suneet had shocks administered to him to the back of his head and his back.’ She said all the men were pressured into signing statements written in Arabic which they did not understand. When her son phoned and told her of the torture, Mrs Cameron said she felt ‘beside myself, sheer horror, terror, just complete and utter meltdown really’. ‘Your son being arrested so far away from home is challenge enough to deal with but, once he told us how he’d been treated, I can only describe it as something from a horror story.’ The Foreign Office has called for a full, independent and impartial inquiry into the allegations and says it has raised them with “very senior officials” in the United Arab Emirates. A spokeswoman for Reprieve said torture by Dubai police was ‘hugely common’ and the charity believed the men’s ‘extremely plausible’ account, which she said had been backed up by notes from Foreign Office staff who had visited the men and documented their injuries. However, Doctor Abdul-Kallek Abdulla, a professor of political science in the UAE, told BBC Radio Five Live there was no proof to support the torture claims and ‘absolutely no truth’ to the allegations heard in the British media. He said: ‘You could say whatever you want but I go by official statements. The UAE is not a country which practices these things.’ The three men were arrested in Dubai in July last year after being accused of drug offences.The three were apparently subjected to torture by police, including electric shocks and beatings, resulting in a broken hand for Mr Williams. If the judge finds them guilty, they face at least 15 years in jail. The three men have denied charges of ‘consumption and possession with intent to distribute’, and appeared at their first trial hearing in February after spending seven months in custody.","Grant Cameron, Suneet Jeerh and Karl Williams all face drugs charges .

It is the Oxford drinking society with some very important alumni – and a rather poor reputation. But the Bullingdon Club was once a perfectly gentlemanly outfit, according to broadcaster David Dimbleby. The Question Time host has revealed his pride at belonging to the controversial group that counts David Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson among its former members. The 74-year-old said: ‘I loved being elected to the Bullingdon Club and I’m very proud of the uniform that I can still get into. ‘We never did these disgusting disgraceful things that Boris did. ‘We . never broke windows or got wildly drunk. It was a completely different . organisation from what it became when Boris Johnson, David Cameron, and .

Bullingdon . stories typically involve drunk, well-off young men in expensive . clothes smashing up restaurants – only to present the owner with a . cheque to cover the damage at the end of the night. Mr Cameron has told friends he is ‘deeply embarrassed’ over his Bullingdon days. The Prime Minister graduated from Oxford with a first-class degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics in 1988. Mr Dimbleby left with a third in the same degree more than two decades earlier.

Michael Fay worked fraudulently as a commercial airline pilot, flying passengers into Gatwick Airport without the proper licence and medical documentation on eight occasions . A conman who faked a pilot’s licence to get a job flying holidaymakers to the UK is being hunted by police after he failed to appear in court for sentencing for fraud. Michael Fay, 59, a US national who settled in Alton, Hampshire, worked fraudulently as a commercial airline pilot, flying passengers into Gatwick Airport without the proper licence and medical documentation on eight occasions. The former US Air Force pilot was sentenced in absentia to three years in prison at Winchester Crown Court on Friday May 3 for fraud. A Hampshire police spokesman said: 'Police were alerted to Fay’s scam when another pilot became suspicious while chatting to him on an internet forum. 'He had been operating Airbus A320 aircraft for eight months on behalf of Libyan company Afriqiyah Airways at the time of his arrest on February 3, 2011, having forged his pilot’s licence and medical certificates. 'Fay is believed to have fled the UK and may be seeking work as a pilot or flying instructor.' Hampshire Constabulary, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and overseas law enforcement are working together to bring Fay back to the UK to begin his sentence. Detective Constable Chris Thorne said: 'Michael Fay is a clever and resourceful man who clearly shows no concern for public safety if he’s willing to work without the correct licences and medical certification. 'He targeted Libyan aviation at a time when the country’s political and economic standing was vulnerable and volatile. 'Had it not been for the quick thinking of a genuine pilot on the internet forum, Fay may have continued to put the public at risk in this manner unnoticed. 'We are working closely with the CAA and other organisations outside of the UK to locate him and bring him to justice. 'Public safety is paramount so it is important people are aware that he may be trying to gain work as an airline pilot or flying instructor overseas.' Fay worked for Afriqiyah Airways from June 1, 2010 to the day of his arrest, February 3, 2011. Fay had been operating the Airbus A320 aircraft (pictured) for eight months on behalf of Libyan company Afriqiyah Airways at the time of his arrest . A spokesman for Afriqiyah Airways said: 'Afriqiyah Airways can confirm that Michael Fay was employed as a contracted pilot on our Airbus A320 aircraft. 'We are currently investigating this matter but we understand that his engagement with us may have been arranged through a third-party broker who should have vetted his documentation and credentials before recommending him as a contractor with Afriqiyah Airways. 'The apparent use of forged documents by Michael Fay to secure his engagement with Afriqiyah Airways has also made us an unwitting victim in his criminal endeavours. Fay flew passengers into Gatwick Airport (pictured) on eight occasions . 'At no time did his behaviour or demeanour draw attention to his ability or competence to fly the aircraft either with his colleagues or the station staff at Gatwick. 'Since the resumption of the airline’s European services in July 2012, as part of our continuous improvement programme all flight-deck crews have been assessed for competence in the UK, Germany and other EU states by flight simulator checks and revalidation on type as necessary.

She revealed John Porter, who has a . grown up son and daughter, had worked in agriculture while his wife . Mary, 77, worked in education before the pair retired. Mrs Bossom added: 'It really has . surprised me and I have only just found out who was involved. They are . good Christian people and very neighbourly - always have been. 'It . is an awful shock to find out this has happened to someone you know, . especially John as he certainly knew his way around a farm. 'I . believe he is retired now, but he worked in something to do with . agriculture. I did not know his brother though. I feel terrible for . them, especially Mary.' Locals said the cows who trampled the . tragic 66-year-old to death belonged to farmer Brian Godwin, who either . rents or owns the land where the tragedy unfolded. It is understood he lives two miles from the field at a farm in Winsley Hill, Bath. A woman at the farm house on Tuesday . said nobody wanted to comment. It is the fourth time cows in the fields . near Turleigh have injured walkers. In 2011 a metal engineer was left with . two broken vertebrae in his neck and a severe leg injury after he was . charged by a cow on a Turleigh field. David Billington was walking home from . The Cross Guns pub in October 2011 when he was knocked to the ground by . a cow and trampled on. Scene: Cows in a field near where Mr Porter was trampled to death and his brother was seriously injured while out walking . He suffered injuries to the head, neck and legs which left him unconscious in the field for more than an hour-and-a-half. Due to the nature of his neck injuries . Mr Billington had to wear a Halo Brace for 12 weeks and needed a skin . graft on his left calf. 'The cows are getting more and more dangerous, and I said it was only a matter of time before someone was killed' - Simon Dark . At the time of the incident his . sister, Cathy Hough said: 'This is a route David takes frequently and . he'd never thought anything like this would happen. 'He has said to me he'd like to warn . people who take that commuter path to be fully aware of the dangers and . how unpredictable cows can be. 'We wouldn't like to see this happen to anyone else and there needs to be extra safety measures put in place.' Simon Dark, who was trampled by cows . while walking his dog on a public footpath near the field in 2008, said . there was a need for action to be taken. He said: 'I was walking my dog on a . public footpath and the cows circled us. I picked her up and pushed my . way through, but when I put her down again they charged at me, knocking . me over and trampling me.

He was also knocked over, and suffered a collapsed lung. 'The cows are getting more and more dangerous, and I said it was only a matter of time before someone was killed. 'Something needs to be done about them. It was a terrifying experience and I don't go near any fields with cows now.' Retired Paul Harris, a local resident who walks his dogs through the fields joined the call for action. He said: 'It really is concerning. It . makes me wonder if there is a rogue cow, because I believe there wasn't . even any calves in the field. 'You would think once would be enough . for the farmers to maybe do something to try and protect people, but . then again I do understand you can't protect every walker and if you . start putting up fences and things they could not get their vehicles . through.' Geraldine Ng, who owns stables which overlook the scene, said the whole village was in shock. She said: 'Everyone is incredibly depressed really, it is such a shock to happen so close. 'I can only imagine that maybe they did not know there were cows in there, because sometimes there is not. 'It is such a beautiful and popular walk down to the pub - it's awful what has happened.'

A village blighted by nearly 900 road signs has won the first major battle in the war against cluttered highways after a council agreed to remove nearly 200. The tiny community of Feock in Cornwall has been dubbed Britain's most over-signed place, with one for every three residents. There are currently 864 road signs on lanes and pathways in the village, which has a population of just 3,000 people. A council has agreed to remove nearly 200 signs in the Cornish village of Feock, dubbed Britain's most over-signed place . There are currently 864 road signs on lanes and pathways in the village, which has a population of just 3,000 people . Feock is in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, boasting stunning waterways, quaint country lanes and picture-postcard views. But its residents say their rural idyll has also become a forest of ugly, bewildering posts and boards that spoil the scenery and baffle drivers. They started a campaign and planners have now agreed to tear down nearly 200 unnecessary signs. Signs for the chop include dozens of duplicate 'Give Way' and 'Road Narrows' notices and a further 111 direction sign posts. The decision is a triumph for the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) which says more than two thirds of roadside signs in rural areas are 'completely pointless'. Alan Truan, clerk of Feock Parish Council, said: 'We have been very keen to address the effect unnecessary signage has on the rural nature and beauty of parts of the area.' Residents in the village say their rural idyll has also become a forest of ugly, bewildering posts and boards that spoil the scenery and baffle drivers . Feock lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, giving it the same status and protection as a National Park. The road sign cull will cost taxpayers £5,000 but potentially save more in reduced maintenance costs. Senior transport campaigner Ralph Smyth now wants more councils to take action to tidy up the countryside. Mr Smyth said: 'CPRE has been campaigning to cut countryside clutter since 1996 so we are delighted that this example of parish council-led action could be copied. Council planners have agreed to tear down nearly 200 unnecessary signs following a campaign by residents . 'While some may say that cuts to council budgets mean removing signs shouldn't be a priority, once you include the savings on maintenance and lighting, it can actually be cost-effective in the longer term. 'By reducing distractions for drivers and making rural areas more attractive, there are many other benefits for communities too.' Jeremy Edwards, of Cornwall Council, said the work to 'de-clutter' Feock was part of a trial project to gauge the typical number of unnecessary road signs in a rural village. He said: 'Striking a balance between essential signage and unnecessary clutter has always provided a dilemma for engineers responsible for highway safety.' The Secretary of State for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin, last year said legislation was in hand to give local authorities the power to banish road-side clutter. He said: 'Too many country roads carry a reminder of how insensitive planners can be to aesthetics. 'Ugly and unnecessary signs clutter up the network. New signs seem to sprout like weeds, without any apparent consideration of what's already there. 'Often what we're left with is not just a blot on the landscape - it's confusing and potentially dangerous too.'","Cornish village of Feock has one sign for every three residents .

Mr Jacobs dodged U-boats and icebergs while making several voyages as part of the Arctic Convoys - delivering vital supplies to the Soviet Union. He was one of many men and women who applied for the new Arctic Star medal to officially recognise their heroism. The medal, officially awarded for the first time last week, is to honour those who suffered as they made harrowing journeys through icebergs and enemy-infested waters. But because he was dying from vascular and respiratory problems his son Mike begged officials to give him the honour two weeks before the official medal-giving ceremony. Mr Jacobs, who joined the forces aged 15 in 1939 and served aboard the HMS Sheffield for two years, received the medal in the post on April 24 - and was to able hold the bronze six-pointed star in his hand as he lay on his death bed. Father-of-two Mr Jacobs, from Box, Wiltshire, then passed away just ninety minutes after he finally received the honour he had always deserved.

Mike, 64, said: 'I applied on his behalf earlier this year, but heard nothing. I then saw David Cameron on the television announcing it, so I got back in touch. The Arctic Convoys were oceangoing convoys which sailed from the United Kingdom, Iceland, and North America to northern ports in the Soviet Union. There were 78 convoys between August 1941 and May 1945 sailing over several seas of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. About 1,400 merchant ships delivered vital supplies to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease program, escorted by ships of the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy, and the U.S. Navy. Eighty-five merchant vessels and 16 Royal Navy warships - two cruisers, six destroyers, eight other escort ships - were lost. The Nazi German Kriegsmarine lost a number of vessels including one battleship, three destroyers and at least 30 U-boats as well as a large number of aircraft. 'But by the end of April, my dad was fading fast, and I got on to them again and told them his life was coming to an end. 'It came in the post the next day, and it was really special. He got to hold it, he got to see it, he knew what it was, what it was for and what it meant. 'An hour and a half later he passed away.' During the war Mr Jacobs helped land tanks on the shores of Normandy during D-Day, where a shell missed his head by inches. He reached the rank of Petty Officer in his spell in the Navy, which ended in 1953 when he moved on to become a stonemason. The Government's decision to issue medals to Arctic heroes came after decades of campaigning by veterans' groups.

Coronation Street actor Bill Roache arrives at Preston Magistrates' Court where he is accused of raping a 15-year-old girl . The waiting photographers, chauffeur-driven black Mercedes and clutch of eager fans suggested a star was on the way. And when Bill Roache arrived at court yesterday, it seemed he was determined to keep playing the part of a celebrity. The Coronation Street actor, who was . flanked by two minders, even signed a few autographs outside court room . number three at Preston magistrates court. But once inside the wood-panelled room, Roache, 81, was simply the accused. He sat behind the lawyers until his case, the first on the morning list, was called. It was the first time he has appeared in court since being charged earlier this month with raping a 15-year-old girl in 1967. When the hearing began, he was told . by a clerk to stand in the dock, from where he confirmed his full name . as William Patrick Roache, his home address in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and . his date of birth as April 25, 1932. He was then allowed to sit as Joanna . White, prosecuting, told the court he was ‘charged with two allegations . of rape which date back to 1967’. Miss White, who did not outline the . details, added: ‘These are matters that can only be dealt with at the . Crown Court. It’s not an early guilty plea matter.’ No plea was entered during yesterday’s . hearing. But in a statement issued earlier this month Roache, who plays . Ken Barlow in Coronation Street, strenuously denied the allegations. Yesterday District Judge Jane Goodwin sent the case to Preston Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on June 10. She granted Roache bail on condition . that he lives at his home or at a relative’s address in London, has no . unsupervised access to anyone under 16 and does not approach two named . witnesses. The 81-year-old, who has played Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap since its launch, arrived at Preston Magistrates Court today to face two counts of rape against his alleged victim in 1967 .

He made no comment  as he walked . to his car outside, despite being besieged camera crews and reporters outside the court. Roache (pictured arriving at Preston Magistrates' Court) was granted conditional bail at the hearing . Roache has played Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap since its launch. In a statement issued earlier this month, he said he was 'astounded and deeply horrified by the extraordinary events' of his arrest and subsequent charging.

He added: 'I strenuously deny the . allegations and will now focus my full attention on fighting to preserve . my innocence in the challenging times ahead.

Roache - the world’s longest-serving soap actor - will not appear in the programme until legal proceedings are concluded, ITV said. He collected an award from Guinness World Records in 2010 for his long service in Coronation Street, having joined in 1960 and appeared regularly ever since. Fellow Coronation Street star Michael .

Designers have revealed the first pairs of 3D printed glasses frames - and say soon we could be able to simply print a replacement pair at home. London-based 3D printers Digits2Widgets has begun making sunglasses frames for designer Ron Arad's new eyewear line, PQ Eyewear. Protos, a company based in San Francisco, produces 3D-printed frames that cost around £115. These 'pixelated' frames are designed to look like Lego bricks . The frames made by Digits2Widgets are printed in the closed position. Slashes, like shark gills, are added where the hinges should be to make them open, and sit securely on the wearer's head . Protos, based in San Fransisco, even prints a range of glasses that appear as if they're pixelated. The Protos frames start at £115, and the company is working on producing tailor-made frames using precise facial measurements. The Ron Arad frames from Digits2Widgets don't have hinges and are instead made of a single piece of nylon. They cost £36 to make, and retail from between £400 and £900. Be warned though, if you're thinking of printing these frames at home, you will need to pay for a specially designed machine that will set you back around £150,000. The Digits2Widgets frames are designed to be built, or printed, in the closed position. A series of slashes, similar to gills on a shark, are cut into the frames at the point where a traditional hinge would go. This means the glasses stems can be pulled apart in order to allow the glasses to be put on the head. When the glasses are removed from the 3D printer, the material memory of the Nylon SLS means the stems revert back to the closed position. And this means they sit securely on the wearer's head. SLS . stands for Selective Laser Sintering and is the process of using lasers . and powder to create layers of nylon that fit together to form a solid . model. Tests by Digits2Widgets have found that the frames can be opened and closed more than 500,000 times before the stems start to loosen. Selective . Laser Sintering (SLS) is a relatively new way of 3D printing that uses a . laser to fuse, or sinter, powder-based materials together. The powder is put together in layers to form a solid model. The printer system has of a laser, part chamber, and control system. The powder is put into a cartridge in the part chamber, and leveled out by a leveling roller. How SLS printing works . A thin layer of material is spread onto the platform and the laser traces a two-dimensional cross section of the part. It then fuses the material together. The . leveling roller pushes material from the powder cartridge across the . platform, where the next cross section is sintered to the previous. And so on. This continues until the part is completed. Once . the model is complete, it is removed from the part chamber and finished . by removing any loose material and smoothing the visible surfaces. Layers and strips of material are built and fused together using a 3D printer to complete the finished frames . Dozens of different-styled glasses can be printed at the same time using 3D printers, see left, and Selective Laser Sintering. A close-up of what this process looks like is pictured right . Digits2Widgets say it can make 25 pairs of the glasses every 36 hours. 3D printing is still a relatively new technology, and printers are still expensive. It can be used to print anything from chocolate, to jewellery, building materials, spare mechanical parts, and even other 3D printers. Tests are also being carried out to see if 3D printing could be used to print human tissue, and car manufacturers have also experimented with printing replacement parts and panels.","Frames can be printed without hinges, or made to look like Lego .

Peter Hayler (pictured with his wife Jean) has been ordered to pay £250 compensation to a 14-year-old boy he punched in the face . A former school governor who punched a teenage boy in anger as he defended his home from vandals has been ordered to pay him £250 compensation. Peter Hayler, 58, was also landed with a criminal record after he snapped and confronted the 14-year old-boy when police failed to act over damage to a dry stone wall. The victim, who was punched in the face, was left with broken teeth, and two black eyes. Although prosecutors accepted there was a 'background of antisocial behaviour' they said the assault on the unnamed boy was 'unprovoked'. Hayler, of Newchurch, Lancashire, who served as a Labour councillor for Rossendale Borough Council in the late 1990s, later appeared in a magistrates’ court and was convicted of battery. He was also fined £300 as well as the compensation order. Details of the case emerged for the first time as the grandfather lost his appeal against his conviction at Burnley Crown Court. He told the court he thought the boy was going to spit at him, and claimed the teenager raised his right arm with the intention of hitting him. Hayler said he responded by instinctively striking a blow with his right fist. Judge Ian Leeming, sitting with two justices, threw out the appeal, despite 'impressive references' from former MPs and the former leader of Lancashire County Council, Hazel Harding, and ordered Hayler to pay further costs of £620. The judge said: 'He did punch and cause these far-from-trivial injuries, not in self-defence. We are sure he did not believe he was about to be attacked.' The former councillor said the old dry stone wall was repeatedly vandalised . The wall was left seriously damaged with stones and earth left scattered on the ground . Peter Hayler said his conviction was 'absolutely amazing' and said his family was 'disappointed' at the verdict . But speaking after the hearing, Hayler a former governor at Crawshawbooth and Waterfoot Primary Schools branded his conviction 'absolutely amazing'. The grandfather, whose wife Jean is also a former Rossendale councillor, said: 'Our family are all disappointed at the verdict. 'In law, a jury would convict only if . there was overriding evidence of guilt and any doubt would deem the . defendant as not guilty. 'The youths were witnessed vandalising my . property, but have lied about the extent of the vandalism.

'I feel that it is reprehensible that . the police have chosen to pursue the victim of anti-social behaviour in . favour of a group of vandals,' he added.

"By . Ian Drury . UPDATED: . 20:42 EST, 1 December 2011 . Britain's bid to introduce a European Union ban on Iranian oil imports was scuppered yesterday by debt-stricken Greece. Foreign Secretary William Hague had secured widespread support at an EU ministers' meeting for tough sanctions to choke off vital funds to the rogue regime in Tehran. But Greece, whose catastrophic finances have left it teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and the Eurozone in meltdown, rejected the hardline crackdown. Retaliation: . Foreign Secretary William Hague, speaking in the Commons earlier this . week, promised to 'intensify' sanctions imposed on Iran . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe . confirmed Athens, which relies on Iranian oil, had a 'number of . reservations' about imposing an embargo. 'Iran sells them oil on credit which is a considerable advantage these days,' said one EU diplomat. But ministers agreed to impose . European travel bans and asset freezes on 180 Iranian individuals and . firms involved in Tehran's controversial nuclear weapons programme at . the meeting in Brussels. It doubled the number targeted to 370. The blacklisted people and companies . were involved with Iranian shipping lines, financial services, energy . and transport, or those associated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Plan of action: Foreign Secretary William Hague, seen here in deep discussion with Polish Foreign Affairs minister Radoslaw Sikorski, made a clear statement of intent on Iran . Unity: German Foreign Affairs minister Guido Westerwelle, left, and Italian Foreign Affairs minister Giulio Terzi di Sant'Agata look on as Mr Hague discusses further action in Brussels today . And officials insisted a ban on buying . Iranian crude oil - amounting to 30million tonnes a year, or 6 per cent . of total EU imports - could be rubber-stamped as early as next month if . other oil nations could plug the gap. A hard-hitting statement said talks . would now focus on new measures aimed at 'severely affecting' Iran's . banks, transport and energy production. The 27-member EU agreed to widen the . blacklist after a United Nations report concluded there was 'credible' evidence that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was still developing an . atomic bomb. Protesters break into the British Embassy and tear down the Union Jack. Some then proceeded to ransack offices . Shattered glass: Iranians have long been suspicious of the UK in large part due to Britain's long-held influence on its rulers and economy prior to the Islamic revolution . Mr Hague had demanded tougher measures to 'increase the isolation of the regime'. Britain was also seeking new sanctions . after a frenzied mob of hardline Iranian protesters attacked the UK . embassy in Tehran on Tuesday. More than 200 thugs stormed the . mission's two compounds. Chanting 'Death to Britain', they hurled petrol . bombs,wrecked and looted diplomats' homes and offices, and set fire to . the Union flag. A student uses a metal bar to strike the British emblem during the mob attacks earlier this week . Eleven rioters were released by Iran yesterday. Ambassadors and diplomats in Tehran . said they were 'shocked' by the extent of damage wreaked inside . Britain's two diplomatic compounds after visiting the premises . yesterday. 'Everybody was shaken. People were pale, shocked by what they saw,' one Western diplomat said on condition of anonymity. Britain's embassy, in the centre of . Tehran, had been turned 'upside down', with paintings ripped apart and . windows smashed, while 'everything was broken' in residences in the . diplomatic compound in the north of the city, another said. In both places, slogans such as 'Down with the British' were scrawled on walls and diplomatic papers were strewn about. Rioters were furious at Britain's . decision last week to unilaterally sever all financial links with Iran . over its nuclear programme. Mr Hague said the 'shameful' attack . was carried out with the 'consent' of the regime. And he retaliated by . kicking Iran's diplomats out of Britain and ordered the immediate . closure of its mission in London, after pulling its own staff out of . Tehran.

Salman Rushdie for supposed blasphemy. Iran expressed regret for the attack on the UK embassy and said a number of protesters had been arrested.

Federal authorities have raided several underground brothels and charged 13 people in a sex slave ring that forced . young Mexican women into prostitution in New York and New Jersey. The authorities say some of the women were delivered to farms in New Jersey, . where each would have sex with up to two dozen farm workers a day. Others . worked in 'cathouses' located in rundown apartments in poor neighborhoods. Court papers say that customers paid $30 for 15 minutes of sex. The women . would get $15 but were usually forced to give it to traffickers who had . smuggled them into the United States. Raid: Thirteen men and women were charged with running a sex-trafficking ring that operated brothels and forced Mexican women to have sex with dozens of clients . Grave allegations: Authorities say some of the women were delivered to farms in New Jersey, while others worked in 'cathouses' located in dingy apartments in Queens and upstate New York . The young sex workers were driven to rural New Jersey, where their handlers . used threats to make them service 25 farmworkers a day. Some of the women were confined to dingy brothels operating out of apartments . in Queens that advertised their services with ‘chica cards’ - business cards . passed out on street corners to attract customers. They were paid very little, . or nothing at all. The Department of Homeland Security's Investigations division raided brothels in Yonkers, Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, and Queens in New York City. In Yonkers, New York, two naked women wrapped in blankets were rushed out of an apartment that was being used as a brothel. They also made arrests in Delaware and Maryland. Their ordeal was detailed in a criminal complaint charging 13 people with . smuggling dozens into the U.S. forcing them into prostitution since at least 2008. Some of the defendants were to appear Wednesday in federal court in . Manhattan to face multiple counts including sex trafficking and interstate . transportation for prostitution. Among those arrested are: Isaias . Flores-Mendez, 40; Bonifacio Flores-Mendez, 33, of Queens; Juana . Lucas-Sanchez, 36, of Milford, Delaware; and David Vasquez-Medina, 28; . Carlos Garcia-De La Rosa, 32. The ring ‘lured their unsuspecting victims to the United States and then . consigned them to a living hell,’ U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a . statement. Serious charges: If convicted, some of the defendants face a maximum sentence of life in prison for sex trafficking . Brutal conditions: The prostitutes were often forced to give up all their earnings and faced beatings if they dared conceal some of the money . The investigation was among several aimed at ‘blockading the repugnant sex . trafficking corridor’ used to exploit victims from Tenancingo, Mexico, said . James Hayes, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in New York. Tenancingo, an impoverished town in Tlaxcala state, has long been a . notorious haven for pimps who use a combination of threats, abuse and broken . promises of marriage and jobs to put innocent victims, some only in their . teens, on a path to sex slavery in Mexico City and in large cities north of the . border. Most victims eventually manage to escape, authorities say in court papers. But, they add, ‘without legal status in the United States, without family and . friends for support, without employment opportunities and as a result of the . trauma they suffered, victims sometimes return to prostitution.’ In interviews with investigators, one unidentified woman described how when . she refused to work at underground brothels in Queens and suburban Yonkers, she . and her child were locked out of their home on a cold winter night. She also told authorities that her pimps, believing she was pregnant, forced . her to take drugs intended to induce a miscarriage, and that she was beaten . when she once tried to withhold some of her earnings. Den of vice: An underground brothel allegedly operating out of this Yonkers building was raided as part of the sex slavery investigation . Another woman recounted becoming romantically involved with a man who smuggled . her into the United States, only to learn he made a living delivering . prostitutes to New Jersey to have sex with farmworkers. She said he used threats to force her into the sex trade for two years . before he was deported. According to the complaint, the ring provided its victims with condoms and . birth control pills while making them have sex with up to 30 men a day. The men . paid $30 for 15 minutes. The women sometimes got a $15 cut but that usually . went to the traffickers. If convicted, some of the defendants face a maximum sentence of life in . prison. The evidence includes wiretaps of customers and pimps haggling over prices, . the complaint says. ‘What girls do you have?’ one customer asked. ‘From Salvador and Mexico.’ ‘How do they look?’ ‘They both look good.’ The pimp quoted a price of $70. ‘Can you do it for 60?’","Federal officials believe sex-trafficking operation has been in business since 2008 .

Facing prison: Handcuffed Lianne Smith leaving the court after being found guilty . As Lianne Smith today faced up to 34 years in a Spanish jail for killing her two children, a riddle over their paternity took a bizarre twist. It has been claimed that their mother had allegedly once worked as a prostitute offering ‘personal services’ to clients across the North of England. Police sources alleged her paedophile partner Martin Smith would drive her to clients and wait in the car. The mystery over their true parentage was made deeper by the fact Rebecca was born in Blackpool, Lancashire, in 2004, and Daniel was born in Barcelona, in 2009. A senior police source in Britain said: ‘In the 1990s, the family had very little money and at one stage were even forced to live for some time in a static caravan. ‘During this time Lianne was offering ""holistic""or ""personal"" services to a wide range of clients in the North, and Martin Smith would drive her to one of these sessions and wait in the car while she conducted the business. ‘It is generally understood by those investigating the case that Miss Smith was offering sexual services to those clients – that she was in fact a prostitute.’ No one from Miss Smith's family could be contacted for comment on the allegations. Her trial in Spain had heard the bombshell DNA revelation that the children she suffocated were not fathered by Smith, but last night that claim was thrown into doubt. A court source said: 'Interpol contacted the court some time ago to tell us the DNA sample we were sent by the British authorities may not have been Martin Smith's.' Unanimous verdict: The jury rejected Smith's defence claim that she was mentally ill . Rebecca was born on July 15, 2004, at . Blackpool’s Victoria Hospital. On her birth certificate, the father is . named as Martin Anthony Smith, a ‘music business manager’. Whether Smith was still offering . ‘personal services’ to paying customers when her daughter was conceived - . is unknown. But  it was around that time, in 2003, she and Smith broke . up for around five months. Daniel was conceived around September . 2008, nine months after the family had fled to Spain and were living . together in a Barcelona apartment. Smith was aged 42 at the time. The . boy was born at Vall d’Hebron hospital on the outskirts of Barcelona on . June 28, 2009. But yesterday Spanish officials could find no record of . his birth being formally registered. At the end of her trial earlier this week, Smith, from  Litchfield, Staffordshire, stared blankly at the floor as the unanimous guilty verdict rang out at Girona Provincial Court, in north-east Spain. The 45-year-old is now on suicide watch after previously trying to kill herself. After eight hours’ deliberation, the jury foreman announced the panel of seven men and two women had believed Smith was ‘fully conscious’ and knew what she was doing when she smothered Rebecca, five, and 11-month-old Daniel in their beds in a Costa Brava hotel. Scroll down for video... Appalling case: Smith is led into the court in Girona, Spain, for the final day of her trial . Blank stare: Lianne Smith looked impassive as the unanimous verdict was read out . They flatly rejected Smith’s defence claim that she was insane, pronouncing her guilty on both counts of murder. It . means she faces spending the next three decades in a standard Spanish . prison cell, as the jury rejected an alternative verdict which would . have allowed her to serve her sentence in a psychiatric wing. Jurors . agreed Smith, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, did suffer from an . unspecified psychosis and from depression – but ruled she was not . criminally insane. They . said she ‘took advantage of  the trust the children gave her as their . mother’ and their ‘defencelessness’ as sleeping children. Judge Adolfo Garcia Morales will sentence her at a later date. Outside court, prosecutor Victor . Pillado Quintas said: ‘Today justice has been done for two defenceless . small children who were murdered in the most abominable and vile way – . by their own mother.’ After the verdicts, the judge and lawyers in the case joined members of the jury in a local bar. During a four-day trial, the court heard . how she killed the children after Smith, 46, her fugitive partner, was arrested on child sex charges at their home in . Barcelona. The hypnotist, from Tyneside, hanged himself in jail in Manchester in January after being reported for sexual abuse. Lianne became obsessed with the idea . that UK social services would put the youngsters in care – which she . considered a fate ‘worse than death’. She asked her daughter if she . would prefer to spend a few brilliant days with her mother or a horrible . lifetime without her. When Rebecca said she wanted to stay . with her mother, Smith took the children to the resort of Lloret de Mar . to give them ‘a perfect holiday’. 'Conscious': The 45-year-old looked on edge today as she waited to hear if the jury would accept her defence of mental illness . Martin Smith, who was found dead in his cell in January . They checked into room 101 of the Hotel Miramar on May 15, 2010. After two days of playing together . and posing for seaside snaps, she put them to bed at about 7pm and . waited an hour until they were asleep. Then she took a plastic shopping . bag and suffocated them. The next day – having tried to commit suicide – she instructed reception to summon Spanish police. During her trial Smith refused to answer more than 100 questions from prosecutor Victor Pillado Quintas. The jury were shown a chilling video of Smith calmly confessing to detectives as she sat on a bed in the next-door hotel room. She told officers: ‘I have ended the . lives of my two children. 'I gave the children a three-day holiday, a . perfect holiday. I knew they were going to take my children to England. ‘My intention was that my children and me together would go. It wasn’t just the children.’ The court heard Smith was . ‘pathologically obsessed’ with her partner Martin Smith – they shared . their surname but she was not his wife. As she was led away to the cells . last night, British social services faced questions about their role in . the tragedy. Both Cumbria and Staffordshire social . services knew Rebecca was potentially at risk when Martin Smith was . arrested on November 1, 2007, on suspicion of rape . Martin Smith was previously thought to be the father of Daniel and Rebecca, whom his partner has admitted killing in a Spanish hotel room . Smith admits suffocating Rebecca and Daniel but claims to have been in an unsound mental state at the time of the killings . Smith in court in yesterday, where she insisted the DNA test results showing her partner was not the father of her two children must have been incorrect . Yet they allowed the family to flee to Spain before Rebecca could be taken to safety. Last night a blame game erupted as . Cumbria social services said they had passed the file to Staffordshire, . who said they were relying on the police to chase the family in Spain. The Spanish equivalent of social services claimed: ‘Nobody put . us on alert and so nobody took any measures to protect the children.’ Even after Martin Smith was deported . to the UK, Staffordshire social services did not ask its counterpart to . retrieve Rebecca, and two weeks later she was dead. A Staffordshire council spokesman . said: ‘During the short time the family were resident in Staffordshire, . the council did everything possible to initiate safeguarding procedures, . and have assisted police fully in their continued investigations into . this case.’ Smith is led into court yesterday after her lawyer called for her to be acquitted on mental health grounds .

The boy of eight killed cheering the runners at the finish line of the Boston Marathon was part of a ‘perfect family’, neighbours said last night. Martin Richard became ‘the boy who will never come home’ when two bombs went off as he waited in the crowd with his family. The explosions happened after they had returned to their seats in the grandstand with ice creams to look for friends who were running, according to US reports.

His older brother Henry, 12, is thought to be unharmed. Just hours after the tragedy their father Bill, 42, a community organiser, was said to be in such shock he ‘looked like the walking dead’. Neighbours described how he came back to his £500,000 flat in Dorchester, Massachussetts, at 10.30pm on Monday still wearing hospital scrubs. Jane Sherman, 64, said Mr Richard spent about ten minutes inside as he got some clothes. She said: ‘I said: “Oh my God Bill, are you okay?” He didn’t even look at me and his friend came over to tell me. He told me that Martin had died and that the others were in the hospital.’ She added: ‘There are no words to describe this whole situation.

It was posted on Facebook yesterday by school friend Lucia Brawley who said: ‘My hope is that we all live by Martin’s words . . . by following his example’. Although he is a runner, Mr Richard had been injured and did not compete in the marathon. Dan Aguilar, 50, a project manager who lives next door, said the Richards seemed to be the ‘perfect happy family’. He said: ‘I saw them on Easter Sunday all sitting on the porch as a family and they all looked so happy. The boys were always playing in the yard, Martin seemed so full of life. ‘They were just a typical American family. When I heard the news it kept me up at night.

An 11-year-old schoolgirl was forced to spend more than a week in hospital after her newly-pierced ear became infected. Destiny Nickson, from Preston, needed eight stitches and IV antibiotics after the ear swelled dramatically. She is now facing a six week recovery period and the possibility of being scarred for life. Destiny had the top of her ear pierced on March 1 and, while it was fine for the first two weeks, it soon became infected. The schoolgirl returned to the beauty parlour in Preston Indoor Market, where the initial piercing was carried out and explained the problem. The staff removed the earring, cleaned her ear, and put a new earring in. They also insisted they could not be blamed for an infection that took hold three weeks after the piercing. Destiny’s mother, Veronica Nickson, 37, said: ‘It was okay for two weeks. It's not the first piercing that has caused the real damage. ‘I know there is a risk with ear piercing. It's what they did the second time when she went back that is my main concern.’ By the time she got home from the salon, Destiny’s ear had ‘doubled in size’, her mother claims. Seeing the swelling, she took her daughter to the doctor who gave her antibiotics. This failed to resolve the problem which just got progressively worse. Eventually, . Destiny was admitted to Royal Preston Hospital on March 26 where she . had the wound lanced and stitched up before she was discharged three . days later. Destiny (pictured with mother, Veronica) is now facing a six week recovery period and the possibility of being scarred for life . However, she then had to be readmitted on April 2 and was kept in for six days while she was given antibiotics through a drip. Ms Nickson said: ‘She had it lanced twice and she had surgery on it twice. After that she was on an IV drip of antibiotics. ‘They put two drains in it because the blood was collecting in her ear and the infection had rotted her cartilage. ‘She has actually lost some of that cartilage. She is a pretty girl and it could have a big impact on her life. The surgeon has said it could take up to six weeks to heal.’ Ms Nickson has raised concerns about the treatment her daughter received from the tattoo and piercing studio. However, Danny Kynaston, master body piercer at Beauty Spot, the piercing and tattoo parlour that Destiny visited, said his team carry out hundreds of ear piercings every week without any complaints and had followed stringent guidelines. The salon that pierced Destiny's ear claims it cannot be responsible for an infection that appeared three weeks after the piercing . Mr Kynaston added that if his shop had caused the infection it would have been apparent within 24 hours, not three weeks later. He said: ‘We pierce a lot of people's ears, more people in Lancashire than anyone probably, and this is a first for us. ‘I don't re-use anything, everything isn't cleaned, it's thrown away. ‘The drill goes away and is sterilised at a warehouse. There is no chance of infection. ‘If it was after about 24 hours I might think to myself something has gone wrong here, but three weeks later it's clearly not to do with us.’ He added that in very rare cases people can be allergic to the titanium used in all their piercings. He said: ‘We take it out and put a plastic one in if that's the case. ‘She would have got instructions on how to clean it. We give them free sea salt and instructions on how to use it.’","Destiny Nickson's ear became infected two weeks after it was pierced .

Toyah Willcox overheard nurses telling her 81-year-old mother Barbara: 'It's alright Barbara, the end is near.' She made the decision to move her mother into a hospice to ensure she spent her last days in as much comfort as possible. But singer Toyah Willcox was horrified to discover that 81-year-old Barbara, who was battling cancer, had been placed on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway without her permission. Miss Willcox spoke of her shock when she overheard a nurse tell her mother: ‘It’s alright Barbara, the end is near.’ The star discovered that the hospice had been preparing to place her mother on the ‘end of life care’ system. The LCP typically involves removing the tubes providing a patient with fluids and nutrition and giving them sedative drugs. She said: ‘For me it was not something I wanted my mother to be told about without me being there to support her. ‘I was not asked or referred to about her last days, so the decision to put her on the LCP was not one I was party to. ‘What unsettles me about the Liverpool Care Pathway is that my mother was told about it whilst she was alone. I shed tears thinking how fearful she must have been at that moment.’ Miss Willcox told nurses that she and her family wanted to manage their mother’s death in their own way. Hours after the conversation  Mrs Willcox became unconscious, and for the next four days her daughter nursed her. She eventually died in her sleep in September 2011 – a week after being admitted to St Richard’s Hospice in Worcester. Her death marked the end of the complicated relationship between the singer and her mother. She said: ‘I would have liked to have been friends with my mother. But my memories of her are not particularly happy ones. Barbara Willcox was alone when she was told by nurses that she would begin end of life care . ‘She actively didn’t like her family and she would say that to us. ‘So she would be quite cruel  to us and I think she realised that in the end. She realised that it was wrong.’ Miss Willcox, who chose never to have children, believes the time she spent caring for her mother finally allowed them to bond. She said: ‘I nursed her for her last two years which was really tough. ‘When . she was unconscious I said a lot of what I wanted to say and I’m sure . she could hear me. It was the only time I could tell her I loved her . ‘I could never say that to her when she was awake because she wouldn’t have it. ‘They put her on the Liverpool Pathway and she screamed for me. I held her until she died. It was the only time she allowed me to hold her.’ Miss Willcox, often described as the high priestess of punk revealed that she and her husband musician Robert Fripp had found an unusual way of dealing with the loss.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Created 4:11 PM on 9th August 2011 . Some men may be more likely to riot because of their 'impulsive' brains. Certain individuals have lower levels of a brain chemical that helps keep behaviour under control, scientists believe. Researchers from the University of Cardiff uncovered a link between impulsiveness and levels of the neurotransmitter GABA in a key brain region. Do rioters, pictured looting a shop in Hackney, have lower levels of a brain chemical that helps keep behaviour under control? Those with low levels tended to be more aggressive and to respond rashly to 'urges'. GABA is one of a family of brain chemicals that allow signals to flow between neurons. Around 30 male university students had their levels of GABA measured using a specialised type of brain scan. They were also asked to complete questionnaires that assessed different aspects of impulsiveness, a trait known to influence self-control. Participants with more GABA in the pre-frontal brain region had lower scores for 'urgency' - the tendency to behave rashly in response to distress or strong emotions and urges. Men with lower GABA levels had higher urgency ratings, making them more likely to act aggressively, drink and take drugs. The link with GABA was specific to the dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex, a region critical to higher thinking functions. The research, funded by the Wellcome Trust, is published in the journal Biological Society. Men with lower GABA - one of a family of brain chemicals that allow signals to flow between neurons - levels had higher urgency ratings, making them more likely to act aggressively, drink and take drugs . Lead scientist Dr Frederic Boy said: 'What is clear is that the way people behave results from a complex interaction between a number of genetic, social and environmental factors. 'What we've found is that one of the reasons why some men act impulsively may be related to lower concentration of GABA in a specific part of men's brains.' None of the undergraduates taking part in the study had any history of psychiatric disorders or substance dependence. The research helps to illustrate the role of basic brain physiology in controlling behaviour, said the scientists. 'The ability to regulate our behaviour in response to a constantly changing physical and social world is key to adapted life,' said Dr Boy. 'Failure in this finely-tuned mechanism is particularly important in most psychiatric disorders, where impulsiveness is the second most common symptom. 'We hope this research will lead to further studies and help bridge the gap between recent genetic studies and imaging studies of psychiatric disorders.' Further to publication of this article, researchers at the University of Cardiff have asked us to make clear that their findings – which related to how some people have lower levels of the brain chemical that keeps behaviour under control – made no mention of rioting. We are happy to make this clear.","Scientists uncover a link between impulsiveness and levels of the .

A fight in the crowded Westfield shopping centre just before the Olympics led to murder and a pitched battle between two gangs, a court heard. Shoppers looked on in horror as Liam Woodards, 24, was stabbed in the chest after glasses and a yoghurt pot were thrown at rivals. As he lay dying, youths began fighting, throwing metal chairs and brandishing two knives, the Old Bailey was told. Victim: Liam Woodards was stabbed at Westfield shopping centre just before the Olympics . 'It was a joint pitched battle,' said Aftab Jafferjee QC, prosecuting. Nii-Azu Kojo Smith, 18, of Hackney Wick, east London, denies murder at the prestigious site next to the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London, on June 29. Seven others aged between 18 and 25 deny violent disorder, while five others have pleaded guilty to various offences, the jury was told. Mr Jafferjee said it was not known if there had been a history between the two groups or whether the confrontation was 'gratuitous and opportunistic violence'. But there had been 'an atmosphere of menace' with 'verbal posturing' between the two sides during the build up. At 4.20pm, the groups converged and after a number of exchanges, they moved towards some central stalls with Mr Woodards ending up amongst the rival youths. Mr Jafferjee said there was little doubt that Mr Woodards had been 'confrontational and mouthy' in the escalating atmosphere. A glass and a yoghurt pot had been thrown by Mr Woodards' group, then a third item, a glass or yoghurt pot landed on or near Kojo-Smith. Mr Jafferjee said: 'The deceased did not throw anything. His only crime was to have been mouthy.'His misfortune was to be closest to Kojo-Smith who was confronting the other man just before the item landed.' Kojo-Smith allegedly produced a knife as Mr Woodards moved away. 'In an utterly disproportionate and lethal reaction, Kojo-Smith lunged forward and stabbed the retreating Liam Woodards in the chest. 'This was as needless as it was cowardly. Mr Woodards was an easy and mouthy target.'

Javin Rigabie, 23, denies being part of the fighting that happened after the murder of Mr Woodards . Shoppers at Westfield shopping centre in east London looked on in horror as Liam Woodards, 24, was stabbed in the chest . Accused: Michael Alvaranga, 24, is one of the group on trial for violent disorder . A thrown yoghurt pot sparked a knife murder in front of horrified shoppers inside the giant mall next to the London Olympic site just weeks before the games began. Two rival gangs squared up to each other as they met in 'The Street' area of the Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford, east London, last June, a court heard today. Plastic bottles and plastic yoghurt pots were thrown and when one hit alleged killer Nii-Azu Kojo-Smith, 18, he responded by pulling out a knife and lunging at Liam Woodard 'whose only crime thus far was to have been mouthy,' the Old Bailey was told. Mr Woodard, who turned 24 the day before his death and had been celebrating his birthday with pals, had the 'misfortune' to have been close to Kojo-Smith when he lunged forward and stabbed him once in the chest. As Kojo-Smith fled, Mr Woodard's friends picked up steel chairs and began hurling them at the rival gang in front of shoppers as two other knives were brandished. Aftab Jafferjee QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey jury the yoghurt pot had been thrown by Danny Caton, 24, who has since pleaded guilty to violent disorder. He said Caton's act 'set in motion the train of events'. Mr Jafferjee said: 'He threw a glass and then a plastic yoghurt pot at or towards the rival group. A third pot or glass was also thrown. It may not readily be apparent who it was. 'As far as the offensive behaviour and verbal posturing in immediate build up for the violence that was to follow, there is little to choose between the conduct of various members of each group , each being as offensive as the other. 'Woodard had plainly not thrown anything, his only crime thus far was to have been mouthy. His misfortune was to be close to Kojo-Smith, each confronting each other either before or after the items were thrown.' He said CCTV captured Kojo-Smith pulling out the knife murder and recorded the murder and the resulting violence. The fight happened just before the Olympics. Pictured here is the Olympic Stadium in London . He added: 'Significantly Woodard, the deceased, was beginning to back away. He was therefore not only unarmed but posing no threat whatsoever to Kojo-Smith. 'In an utterly disproportionate and lethal reaction, Kojo-Smith lunged forward and stabbed the retreating Woodard in his chest. 'Kojo-Smith seeks to rely on self-defence. The prosecution case is that the evidence demonstrates that nothing could be further from the truth. 'This was an act by Kojo-Smith that was as needless as it was cowardly. Kojo-Smith had a knife and he could see Woodard did not. Woodard was an easy and mouthy target, it was as simple and mindless as that.' Mr Jafferjee said as Kojo-Smith fled Woodard's friends been hurling chairs and in the mayhem that followed it was not apparent Woodard had been stabbed. He said: 'A frightening event for members of the public who were obviously around at the time simply trying to shop and enjoy themselves in such avenue shortly before the London Olympics was to begin, this being June 29.' Kojo-Smith, of Hackney, denies murder. Michael Alvaranga, 24, Javin Rigabie, 23, Travis Townsend, 21, and members of Woodard's gang Tony Caton, 21, Anselm Legemah, 18, Jason Vaughan, 25, and Emmanuel Oloyede, 19, all deny violent disorder.

Two foreign rioters jailed for their part in England's civil unrest two years ago have foiled attempts to deport them by citing their human right to 'family life'. The successful appeals by Ubong-Luke Nkanta, of south-east London, and a second man, who has been granted anonymity, defy the Government's pledge to deport any foreign national convicted over the 2011 disturbances. Critics say the decisions sharply contradict official efforts to take exemplary action against those involved in the outbreaks of violence in London and elsewhere that summer. A Carpetright store burns on Tottenham High Road on August 6, 2011: Two foreign rioters jailed for their part in the civil unrest have foiled attempts to deport them by citing their human right to 'family life' Government anger over the use of Article Eight of the Human Rights Act, which enshrines the right to a family life, has prompted Home Secretary Theresa May to draft new laws to stop foreign criminals avoiding deportation. Ministers believe judges will be unable to ignore the new legislation, as they appear to have ignored rules introduced last July that they should only allow the use of Article Eight in 'exceptional circumstances'. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said today: 'Any foreign national who abuses the privilege of coming to the UK by committing a serious offence should face the consequences. 'Many of those convicted of involvement in the 2011 summer's riots are still behind bars - that's where they belong. 'We are pursuing deportation in scores of cases and wherever possible we will remove them from the UK — regardless of whether they have family here. 'We are disappointed with this judgment and that is why this Government will bring forward primary legislation to prevent foreign nationals remaining in the UK through abuse of the Human Rights Act. 'We are also looking at appeals to make sure that foreign nationals cannot misuse the legal system and the courts in bids to stay in the country.' A youth films rioters throwing missiles at police lines on August 8, 2011: Government anger over the use of the Human Rights Act has prompted Theresa May to draft new laws to stop foreign criminals using it . A masked rioter is seen dragging a bin in to make barricades in Hackney: More than 200 foreign criminals were convicted for their part in the riots in which hundreds of millions of pounds of damage was done . The latest cases, reported in the Sunday Telegraph, highlight the arguments used which are causing the Home Office such frustration. In the first case, Nigerian-born Ubong-Luke Nkanta, from Thamesmead, was in November 2011 jailed for 18 months for burglary during the riots in London. The 25-year-old entered a building which was being looted by rioters but did not steal anything because, he told the court, 'there was nothing left to take'. The Home Office began deportation proceedings against him as he approached his release from jail last summer, but he appealed against the move by citing his 'right to a family life'. He argued his relationship with his two biological children in the UK as well as his current partner's children meant his human rights would be breached if he was deported. The lower immigration tribunal agreed and, following an appeal by the Home Office, the decision was upheld by Upper Immigration Tribunal Judge Isabel Murray. The second case is of a Zimbabwean who can only be named as 'TS' after senior immigration judges granted him anonymity - despite the fact criminal courts had allowed him to be named. He was convicted of violent disorder and jailed for 15 months after joining a group of 30 to 50 youths who rampaged through two Buckinghamshire towns in copy cat riots three days after the initial outbreak of violence in Tottenham. The gang, which was later described in court as a 'mindless mob', swept through Milton Keynes and Bletchley launching attacks on vehicles and shops, including a Chinese takeaway whose owners were robbed of their takings. TS was identified as one of the main culprits who launched an attack on a bus which left its driver 'frightened for her life' as they kicked the vehicle and pelted it with rocks. A masked youth during riots in Hackney, London: Both the rioters in today's story were granted the right to remain in the country based on their right to a family life under Article Eight of the Human Rights Act . Ministers had pledged to take tough action to kick out foreign criminals as quickly as possible after the riots in August 2011 which began in Tottenham, north London and spread across the country into several nights of carnage. More than 200 foreign criminals were . convicted for their part in the riots in which shops were plundered, . businesses set ablaze and hundreds of millions of pounds of damage done. Home Office minister Damian Green said at the time: ‘We strongly believe that foreign national lawbreakers should be removed from the UK at the earliest opportunity. ‘We also have the power to cancel visas of foreign nationals found guilty of criminal activity, and this is something we will be looking to do when these cases arise.’ In the following months, it emerged that non-UK nationals played a central role in the mayhem. Figures from the courts showed one in seven of all convicted rioters was from overseas. The Ministry of Justice released a list showing 44 nationalities of convicted rioters, including those from Afghanistan, Cuba, Ethiopia and Samoa. The largest group was Jamaicans, followed by Somali and Polish offenders. Other rioters came from Colombia, Iraq, the Congo, Vietnam and Zimbabwe.","Immigration Minister says he is 'disappointed' by the judgment .

Mysterious 'monster' outflows of charged particles from the centre of our Galaxy, stretching more than halfway across the sky, have been detected by astronomers. Researchers say they contain an 'extraordinary' amount of energy - but stress they pose to harm to us. The researchers were able to map the cosmic 'geysers' of gas. This shows the ¿geysers¿ (in blue) shooting out of the Milky Way . From top to bottom the outflows . extend 50,000 light-years [five hundred thousand million million . kilometres] out of the Galactic Plane. That's equal to half the diameter of our Galaxy (which is 100,000 light-years — a million million million kilometres — across). Seen from Earth, the outflows stretch about two-thirds across the sky from horizon to horizon. The giant cosmic geysers were mapped mapped with CSIRO's 64-m Parkes radio telescope in Australia, and the outflows were detected by astronomers from Australia, the USA, Italy and The Netherlands. The finding is reported in today's issue of Nature. 'These outflows contain an extraordinary amount of energy — about a million times the energy of an exploding star,"" said the research team's leader, CSIRO's Dr Ettore Carretti. But the outflows pose no danger to Earth or the Solar System. The speed of the outflow is supersonic, about 1000 kilometres a second. 'That's fast, even for astronomers,"" Dr Carretti said. 'They are not coming in our direction, but go up and down from the Galactic Plane. 'We are 30,000 light-years away from the Galactic Centre, in the Plane. They are no danger to us.' From top to bottom the outflows extend 50,000 light-years [five hundred thousand million million kilometres] out of the Galactic Plane. That's equal to half the diameter of our Galaxy (which is 100,000 light-years — a million million million kilometres — across). Seen from Earth, the outflows stretch about two-thirds across the sky from horizon to horizon. The outflows correspond to a 'haze' of microwave emission previously spotted by the WMAP and Planck space telescopes and regions of gamma-ray emission detected with NASA's Fermi space telescope in 2010, which were dubbed the 'Fermi Bubbles'.However, the the WMAP, Planck and Fermi observations did not provide enough evidence to indicate definitively the source of the radiation they detected, but the new Parkes observations do. A second view of the 'galactic geysers' that have been mapped . 'The options were a quasar-like outburst from the black hole at the Galactic Centre, or star-power — the hot winds from young stars, and exploding stars,' said team member Dr Gianni Bernardi of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 'Our observations tell us it's star-power.' In fact, the outflows appear to have been driven by many generations of stars forming and exploding in the Galactic Centre over the last hundred million years. The key to determining this was to measure the outflows' magnetic fields. 'We did this by measuring a key property of the radio waves from the outflows — their polarisation,' said team member Dr Roland Crocker of the Max-Planck-Institut fuer Kernphysik in Heidelberg, Germany, and the Australian National University. The new observations also help to answer one of astronomers' big questions about our Galaxy: how it generates and maintains its magnetic field. 'The outflow from the Galactic Centre is carrying off not just gas and high-energy electrons, but also strong magnetic fields,' said team member Dr Marijke Haverkorn of Radboud University Nijmegen in The Netherlands. 'We suspect this must play a big part in generating the Galaxy's overall magnetic field.'","Outflows contain an extraordinary amount of energy — about a million times that of an exploding star .

But Morgan has now been diagnosed with the rare cancer Burkitt Lymphoma and she is nursing him through the ordeal. In it together: Wendy Schmidt is helping her son Morgan battle the condition that she recently beat . ‘Morgan is so young but he understands the situation because he has seen me lose my hair,’ says Wendy, a travel agent from Pontprennau, Cardiff. ‘My experience [of cancer] has helped him because he knows he will get through it and that his hair will grow back.’ Wendy had just been given the all clear when she was given the shattering news that Morgan was suffering with a rare cancer affecting children and young adults. ‘One day he turned to me and said: ""Mum, have I got cancer?”’ remembers Wendy. ‘We both cried but I promised myself I would never lie to him and I told him he had cancer.

Forget house prices or the  number of prestigious 4x4s parked in the drive – there’s a new way to tell whether or not you live in an affluent neighbourhood. Supermarket giant Sainsbury’s has chosen just 53 branches out of more than 1,000 nationwide to become part of its new breed of  Champagne Stores. Catering to the wealthy customers who frequent them, these stores will be the only ones in the Sainsbury’s empire that will stock the more upmarket brands of bubbly, including £130 bottles of Krug and a range of Bollinger ‘Cru’ vintages. The supermarket is planning a two-tier system for spirits too, where only certain stores will supply £70 bottles of 17-year-old malts or a £120 Glenmorangie. A spokeswoman said: ‘Within our Champagne Stores we have significantly extended our champagne offering to include ultra premium brands such  as Krug, Dom Perignon and Bollinger Grand Année, as well as a greater choice of products available in magnum. ‘The response from our customers to this news has been very positive, and it suggests that while some customers have traded down to more affordable but less prestigious options, such as prosecco, there is real potential to open up the top-end of the market to customers willing to experiment.’ And so to the big question: which areas does Sainsbury’s consider posh enough to have one of its  Champagne Stores? At the moment, there is a clear North-South divide – the vast majority of the revamped shops are in London and the Home Counties. Two tier: Some Sainsbury's stores will be considerably more upmarket than others in their drinks selection, depending on the area . Well-catered: Winchester in Hampshire made the cut as a town that would buy champagne . There are none in Wales or Yorkshire, and Scotland merits only one inclusion – Garthdee, a suburb of oil-rich Aberdeen. Prime Minister David Cameron, Jeremy Clarkson and other members of the well-heeled Chipping Norton Set can breathe a sigh of relief – the Sainsbury’s store in Banbury, Oxfordshire, will be stocking up with Bollinger. And should Tony Blair find time to return to his old constituency of Sedgefield, County Durham, he might dip into the millions of pounds he has made since leaving office to treat his wife Cherie to a bottle of Krug. Nearby Darlington is also on the list, perhaps surprisingly as the North East town is more associated with brown ale and the industrial birthplace of railways than popping champagne corks. Other locations include some of the more scenic towns of Britain, such as Chester, and Penrith in the Lake District. King’s Lynn in Norfolk also makes the grade, which will be of comfort to cultured local resident Stephen Fry should he want a more expensive brand of bubbly to impress his dinner party guests.","Sainsbury’s in wealthy areas will be stocking Krug and vintage Bollinger .

It's unlikely you'll hear a little girl utter the words, 'when I grow up, I want to be a funeral director.' But Poppy Mardall, 29, who has herself embarked on the morbid career, thinks more women should break into the male dominated profession. 'Women are in the minority in this industry. While women often care for the dying as nurses, there's a perception that when you die it's then the 'men in black' who should come in and sort everything out,' she told the MailOnline. Career change: Poppy Mardall gave up a job at Sotheby's to set up her own funeral service . 'There's a perception that men are better at coping with death because they can shut down their emotions. But it's also important to be in touch with feelings and to be caring - both for helping take care of someone's body and helping their bereaved family.' Poppy, from Fulham, South West London, gave up a career as deputy director and expert at Sotheby's to set up her own business, Poppy's Funerals, last June. Her change in career was influenced by her work volunteering at the Samaritans and Trinity Hospice. She explains: 'I wanted to do a job that was more important, where I could help people. The way we have dealt with death and dying hasn't changed for centuries. I want to give people more choice and support.' No 'men in black': Poppy takes a more feminine approach with no black hearses or black coffins . She added that she has 'no fascination with death' as her work is really about 'helping the living' by supporting grieving families. Nevertheless, of course she does also have to work with death bodies in the mortuary on a regular basis and prepare them for cremation. So how does she cope with this aspect of the job? 'Before I did the job I had never seen a dead body and, like most people, thought of it as something scary. But I quickly got used to it. It's not scary, it's the person who you love whose heart has stopped beating,' she said. 'The job has made me hold the people I love tighter and appreciate them more' Dealing with grieving families daily must also be harrowing but Poppy said she finds the work 'sad but fulfilling'. She added: 'With this job I get a tangible sense of helping people. It's meaningful, wonderful work.' If she ever has a particularly difficult day, she said she unwinds by talking about it to husband Chris, 29, and going for walks. She added that her work has changed her own outlook on life. 'It has made me hold the people I love tighter. It has made me appreciate them more and not to dwell on small things, hold grudges or let arguments lie unresolved.' Rewarding work: The funeral director said she no longer finds dead bodies 'scary' Poppy said is putting feminine touches into her business by doing away with black hearses and black coffins. Instead, her vehicles are white and covered in poppies and they use coffins made from willow and bamboo. She believes her approach is more personal and meaningful, doing away with the pomp for a simpler and modern cremation where the families of the bereaved can call the shots. As many people don't like to think about death, Poppy said when she reveals her profession it can often be a conversation-stopper at parties.

And when their hectic schedule gets too much, well, they fall asleep right where they are. In the case of these exhausted pandas, that means perched precariously in a tree. This giant panda is fast asleep perched in the branches of a tree in Panda Valley park, Sichuan province . These adorable photographs show the giant pandas fast asleep amongst the branches of trees in the Panda Valley park in Dujiangyan, southwest China's Sichuan province. How they managed not to fall out is perhaps a secret known only to pandas, but there's no doubt they looks pretty relaxed as they catch up on their sleep. Giant pandas live in temperate-zone bamboo forests in central China, in mountain ranges in China's Sichuan, Saanxi, and Ganshu regions. Their thick black and white fur coat keeps them warm in the cool forests. One of the rarest animals in the world - there are only around 1,000 left in the wild and 140 in zoos and breeding centres - they have come to symbolize animal conservation efforts. Their diet is 99 per cent bamboo, but they also eat grasses, small rodents or even musk deer fawns.  They have large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles to crush the bamboo. While they look like large teddy bears, they are considered as dangerous as any other bear.

A second top-ranking official has left the IRS as the Obama Administration tries to dig out of the firestorm resulting from revelations that tax-collectors targeted conservative Tea Party groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status. An internal IRS memo says Joseph Grant, commissioner of the agency's tax exempt and government entities division, will retire on June 3. On Wednesday President Barack Obama demanded that acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller resign, making him the highest-ranking political casualty thus far in a series of scandals that have swept the administration in recent weeks. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Steven Miller is shown in a CBS report. He has submitted his resignation, but informed employees at the IRS that he would be leaving 'as my acting assignment ends in early June' In with the new: Daniel Werfel, the controller of the White House Office of Management and Budget, will become the new acting head of the IRS. He is a trusted Obama adviser . Obama has named longtime civil servant Daniel Werfel as the acting IRS commissioner. Werfel, 42, currently serves as controller of the Office of Management and Budget, making him a key player in implementing recent automatic spending cuts known as the sequester. In a hastily called press conference in the East Room of the White House on Wednesday, Obama told reporters that he had asked Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew to find out who was responsible for a program that targeted tea party groups and other conservative organizations for a special level of intrusive questioning after they applied for tax-exempt charitable statuses. 'Lew took the first step by requesting and accepting the resignation of the acting director of the IRS,' Obama said. 'It’s important,' he added, 'to institute new leadership that can help restore confidence going forward.' But in an email to IRS employees, Miller claimed he would only be leaving next month because his assignment would be over. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, formerly Obama's chief of staff, gave Miller his walking papers, according to the president . 'It is with regret that I will be . departing from the IRS as my acting assignment ends in early June,' Miller wrote. 'This has been an incredibly difficult time for the IRS . given the events of the past few days, and there is a strong and . immediate need to restore public trust in the nation’s tax agency.' The IRS, the president conceded, 'improperly screened conservative groups.' He referred to a report released Tuesday by the IRS's Inspector General. 'The misconduct that it uncovered is inexcusable,' Obama exclaimed. 'It's inexcusable and Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it.' 'It should not matter what political stripe you're from,' Obama said. 'The IRS has to operate with absolute integrity.' President Barack Obama said he would implement the recommendations of the IG report, but insisted that acting IRS Commissioner Steven MIller would be stepping down. It's the highest-profile resignation in his five-year-old administration . Promising to adopt the recommendations of the Inspector General's report, Obama pledged to 'put in place new safeguards to make sure this kind of behavior can't ever happen again.' 'We will work with Congress as it performs its oversight role,' he added, saying the White House would march 'hand in hand with Congress to get this thing fixed.' Tax laws, he insisted, must be 'enforced in a fair and impartial way.' Miller's farewell letter cited 'a strong and immediate need to restore public trust in the nation’s tax agency.' 'I believe the Service will benefit from having a new Acting Commissioner in place during this challenging period,' he wrote. 'As I wrap up my time at the IRS, I will be focused on an orderly transition.'","Steven Miller is ousted but writes face-saving email announcing departure when his 'assignment ends in early June.'

Only one in five patients receive any information or advice on the emotional impact of having a stroke . Almost half of stroke survivors feel ‘abandoned’ when they leave hospital, warns a leading charity. Barely one in five receive any information or practical advice on the emotional impact of having a stroke – unlike the support given to cancer patients. Yet two thirds of people who survive a stroke suffer depression and anxiety, and fear of having another stroke. A new report from the Stroke Association says the toll taken on families is underestimated, with half of married couples finding their relationship under strain. Of these, a survey found nearly three in 10 had broken up with their partner or were considering leaving. Strokes affect around 152,000 Britons each year, with the resulting brain damage being the largest cause of adult disability in the UK. In a new survey 2,700 people affected by stroke said the emotional effects of stroke were ‘as devastating as the physical effects’. Hospital care was highly rated by stroke survivors and their families, but 42 per cent said they felt abandoned after leaving hospital. Although most cancer units provide patients with information about sources of support and advice on emotional wellbeing, this was lacking for 79 per cent of stroke survivors when they left hospital. Figures show NHS costs are higher for patients with long-term health problems who are also depressed, and they are four times more likely to die prematurely. The survey says the plight of carers is overlooked. One in three is ill-prepared for their new role when their loved one comes home from hospital – rising to three-quarters after nine months. ‘Many carers have told us they feel they have to fight tooth and nail to get services they or their loved ones need’ says the report. Jon Barrick, chief executive of The Stroke Association, said: ‘Stroke leaves survivors and families shocked, shaken and anxious as their lives are often irreversibly changed in an instant. Two thirds of people who survive a stroke suffer depression and anxiety, and fear of having another stroke . ‘There are over one million stroke survivors living in the UK and with an ageing population this figure is only set to increase. ‘Better recognition by health and social care professionals of the impact of stroke will help people to be properly assessed and get the right support.’ The charity is calling for all patients and families to be given access to information, practical advice and emotional support after suffering a stroke. Professor Reg Morris, clinical psychologist at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: ‘Depression, anxiety and fear of another stroke are common feelings among those touched by the condition and in the most extreme cases people can be left feeling suicidal. ‘Better recognition of the emotional effects of stroke by health and social care professionals is essential in order to address the need for integrated psychological support for survivors and their families. ‘We know that with the right emotional, psychological and physical care more stroke survivors will have the opportunity to make their best possible recovery.’","Only one in five stroke patients receives information or advice about the emotional impact of having a stroke .

"By . Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:40 EST, 12 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:44 EST, 12 December 2012 . Researchers have named a newly discovered, prehistoric lizard 'Obamadon gracilis' in honor of the 44th president's toothy grin. The small, insect-eating lizard was first discovered in eastern Montana in 1974, but a recent re-examination showed the fossil had been wrongly classified as a Leptochamops denticulatus and was in fact a new species, researchers told Reuters on Tuesday. Obamadon gracilis was one of nine newly discovered species reported on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. President among reptiles: In this artist's impression the light blue Obamadon in the foreground observes the prehistoric action. In the background, the asteroids that would wipe out the dinosaurs begin to hurtle towards earth . In naming the new species, scientists from Yale and Harvard universities combined the Latin 'Obamadon' for 'Obama's teeth' and 'gracilis,' which means slender. 'The lizard has these very tall, straight teeth and Obama has these tall, straight incisors and a great smile,' said Nick Longrich, a paleontologist at the school in New Haven, Connecticut. It was believed to have lived during the Cretaceous period, which began 145.5 million years ago. Along with many dinosaurs from that era, the lizard died out about 65 million years ago when a giant asteroid struck earth, scientists say. Similar smiles: Yale paleontologist, Nick Longrich, claims the Obamadon lizard and the president share 'very tall, straight teeth' Longrich said he waited until after the recent U.S. election to name the lizard. 'It would look like we were kicking him when he's down if he lost and we named this extinct lizard after him,' he said in an interview. 'Romneydon' was never under consideration and 'Clintondon' didn't sound good, said Longrich, who supported Hillary Clinton's failed run against Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary. Obama is not the first politician whose name has been used to help classify organisms. Megalonyxx jeffersonii, an extinct species of plant-eating ground sloth, was named in honor of President Thomas Jefferson, an amateur paleontologist who studied the mammal. Many animals and plants, both extinct and living, are christened after famous people. On the left is A. bushi - the beetle named for George W Bush. On the right is Eristalis gatesi, a Costa Rican flower fly inspired by Bill Gates . Earlier this year, researchers announced they had named five newly identified species of freshwater perch after Obama, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Jimmy Carter and Theodore Roosevelt. In 2005, entomologists named three species of North American slime-mold beetles agathidium bushi, agathidium cheneyi and agathidium rumsfeldi in honor of George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld - the U.S. president, vice president and secretary of defense at the time. Other celebrity names also have been used to name new species. A small Caribbean crustacean has been named after reggae icon Bob Marley, an Australian horsefly has been named in honor of hip-hop star Beyonce, and an endangered species of marsh rabbit has been named after Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner.","Obamadon gracilis died out around 65 million years ago .

Initial reporting of Saturday's crash indicates there was no enemy activity in the area at the time, NATO said. It has not been confirmed whether the victims, all working for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), were military staff or civilians, nor their nationalities. Four members of NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) have died in a plane crash in southern Afghanistan (file photo) The military alliance did not confirm exact location of the crash but local authorities in the southern province of Zabul, said an aircraft belonging to foreign forces crashed Saturday afternoon in Shah Joy district. Mohammad Jan Rasoulyar, deputy governor of Zabul, said the site had been surrounded by international forces. Earlier today reports came through of several Taliban attacks in the northern Faryab Province. Military insurgents are believed to have taken control of several villages in the province's Qaisar district. Protest: Campaigners march to RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, which started flying armed drones over Afghanistan this week . Anti-drone: Hundreds of protesters joined the march proclaiming drones make it too easy to launch deadly attacks from a distance and out of public sight . More than 60 insurgents had been killed, a spokesman for the provincial governor, Jawed Baidar, told the BBC. He added that women and children are believed to have been among the casualties. Earlier on Saturday anti-war protesters . descended on a Royal Air Force base in Waddington, Lincolnshire, which . started flying armed drones over Afghanistan this week . ISAF is a NATO-led security mission in Afghanistan established by the UN Security Council in 2001. Its main purpose is to train the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and aid in rebuilding key government institutions, but has engaged in combat. All NATO member states contribute with troops to ISAF, as well as a number of non-member states including Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Finland. About 400 peace activists marched on the RAF base to protest against the new drone-operating squadron announced by the Ministry of Defense Thursday. Previously, British drones were operated only from a U.S. Air Force base in Nevada. Protesters marched to the perimeter fence of RAF Waddington saying drones make it too easy to launch deadly attacks from a distance and out of public sight. ‘Because of their remote nature, there is no risk to any of our forces and that makes it easier to launch weapons and makes it much easier for politicians to get involved in warfare,’ said Chris Cole of the Drone Campaign Network. The Reaper drones are used for intelligence and surveillance missions but also are equipped with missiles and bombs. The MoD says drone operators ‘adhere strictly to the same laws of armed conflict and are bound by the same clearly defined rules of engagement as other RAF pilots.’","Four NATO staff die in crash southern Afghanistan on Saturday .

A major search for a baby feared lost at sea has been called off after police said they believe initial reports that an infant fell from a ferry were incorrect. The land and sea operation, costing tens of thousands of pounds, at the mouth of Belfast Lough was triggered after a woman plunged from the Stena Line boat as it made its way into port from Cairnryan in Scotland last night. The 37-year-old Belfast woman was rescued within 15 minutes and taken to the city's Royal Victoria Hospital for treatment, where she remained in a stable condition today. At the time of the incident it was reported that a baby had also entered the water with the woman, prompting extensive searches that began last night and continued this morning.

A spokesman for the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: 'It's very difficult to put a figure on the rescue because we have volunteers and people sitting in operations as well. 'Generally speaking it would have been thousands of pounds, but generally we would never put a value on a human life and we would put in all the resources we thought were necessary for a given situation.'

The 47-year-old spoke with reporters last night in . the small Iowa town of Pella, where she and her husband attended . the first public screening of a film about her rise in politics, called The Undefeated, and she dismissed comments from her daughter that she's made up her mind about running. Her daughter, Bristol, had said in an earlier television interview that her mother had made up her mind - but Mrs Palin, who lost to Barack Obama three years ago, says that's inaccurate. Scroll down for video . Meet-and-greet: Sarah Palin says hello to supporters during a BBQ after the screening of The Undefeated .

Praising: Stephen K. Bannon's documentary The Undefeated will premiere tonight and is known to paint the former governor in a very favourable light . Despite the airing of the film, which . has prompted speculation that she will run again in 2012, she says . deciding to run for President . is a 'tough decision' and she's not ready to announce her intentions. A throng of supporters chanted her . name and urged her to run for President outside the Pella Opera House, . where roughly 350 people packed the theatre. Stephen K. Bannon's documentary chronicles Palin's life and her progress through the ranks of government. It is said to be a flattering portrait of her time on the McCain campaign and her rise as a national heroine to the tea party. The Former Alaska Governor signs autographs at the screening, while one elderly fan proudly holds her ticket . Former colleague: John Bitney is interviewed for Broomfield's documentary in which he describes Palin as being 'frustrating' and 'engaged' Reports have already been circulating . that the former Alaska governor and her aides were inviting prominent . Republicans from the state to meet with her after the screening. But Palin's political action committee already denied the reports as well as Republican operatives in Iowa. One told ABC news: 'Not only have I . not heard from Governor Palin regarding meetings, I am unaware of anyone . who has been contacted regarding private meetings.' Scathing: English director Nick Broomfield will be showing his as-yet-untitled documentary to buyers this weekend . It was on a Politico blog with the . headline 'Sarah Palin team reaching out to Iowa activists for meetings' that former Iowa GOP executive director and prominent conservative Chuck . Laudner told Politico that a 'Palin backer' contacted him about . attending a mingling session after the film. Several other prominent GOP activists also told Real Clear Politics that they had not been contacted regarding potential sit-downs with Palin while she is visiting the important early nominating state. The majority of the documentary details Palin's early political career using old news archives and interviews with conservatives and Palin allies such as Thomas Van Flein, now a Capitol Hill staffer. The movie opens with a photo montage and home videos showing Palin as a young girl and in her early teens. The million-dollar project is set for national release in July. Palin is said to have already seen a rough cut of the movie. In a statement released by the movie's distributor, the 47-year-old said she looks 'forward to seeing the finished film for the first time with fellow Americans from the heartland'. The Undefeated is not the only documentary about the possible presidential candidate. British filmmaker Nick Broomfield is shopping a documentary that examines Palin's life and rise to prominence through interviews with her parents, friends, and colleagues. It is thought that the filmmaker has painted a scathing portrait of Palin. American filmmaker Stephen Bannon has put together a flattering portrait of Palin which is said to present her as a Joan of Arc-like figure. He relies on interviews with her allies in Alaska and sympathetic conservative commentators in an unapologetic defence of Palin. It charts her rise from Wasilla mayor to Alaska governor in what is described as a 'zero-warts' version of her rise through the political ranks and borrows heavily from her autobiography Going Rogue. Palin is portrayed as a national heroine, beset by vicious left-wing enemies seeking to thwart her heroic attempts to revive Reagan's conservative legacy. It incorporates previously unseen footage from her childhood and early years as an elected official with the end focusing on her as a tea party hero who is 'the type of leader this country needs'. The Undefeated shows her as a Republican operating outside the party's traditional men's club power structure and questions the manhood of GOP leaders for not defending her after the 2008 election. It will be premiered in Iowa tonight and open nationwide on July 15. English filmmaker Nick Broomfield has vowed to unveil the 'real' Sarah Palin in his as-yet-untitled film about her. It is said to examine her life and rise to prominence through interviews with her parents, friends and colleagues. In a preview from the clip ex-legislative director John Bitney and ex-Senate president Lyda Green complain about her habit of using her Blackberry during meetings.

A sacked Government drugs tsar has been awarded more than £500,000 of public money to carry out a controversial world-first trial using ‘magic mushrooms’ to treat depression. Professor David Nutt wants to investigate the way sick patients are affected by a hallucinogenic substance contained in the mushrooms. As president of the British Neuroscience Association, he has been given the cash by the Medical Research Council. The exercise is also backed by shadowy charity the Beckley Foundation, which is run by an aristocrat dubbed ‘Lady Mindbender’ and lobbies to liberalise laws on mind-altering drugs. But Professor Nutt’s chances of carrying out his research are being hampered by ‘archaic’ European, United Nations and Home Office laws which govern clinical trials and make such drugs illegal. He says it is impossible to gain access to the hallucinogen to carry out the trial and is fighting for a change in the law. Magic mushrooms are, along  with heroin and cocaine, defined as potent Class A drugs. They are known to have a powerful effect, and are thought to have the potential to make some mental disorders worse. Possession can lead to seven years in jail and an unlimited fine, and some users have complained of suffering flashbacks and paranoia. Several deaths have been linked to magic mushrooms in recent years. Previous research carried out by Professor Nutt on healthy volunteers – which is subject to far less rigorous regulation – found that psilocybin, the active ingredient in the mushrooms, reduced the level of activity in the part of the brain which appears to cause some  people to be locked into a continual cycle of depression. He now wants to explore whether prescribing magic mushrooms to those with severe depression can, along with regular psychotherapy, improve a patient’s well-being. Speaking ahead of the British Neuroscience Association’s festival of neuroscience this week, Professor Nutt said: ‘Finding a company to provide this illegal drug has, as yet, proved impossible. ‘So we’re between a rock and a hard place, which is unfortunate. Because if this is an effective treatment – which it may well be for some people – then they’re obviously being denied that possibility. Dangerous: Magic mushrooms are thought to have the potential to make mental disorders worse . ‘One of the things we have to do is have a more rational debate about the way the drug laws are implemented. If they’re actually denying access to powerful tools which could potentially improve human well-being, then they’re not doing what they should be doing.’ Professor Nutt added: ‘I’ve spoken to people in Government and we’re continuing to try to get the Home Office to understand that the current way the regulations are implemented is hindering research. ‘We have an archaic set of laws which were established by the United Nations in the Sixties and they’re inappropriate for modern medicine and modern science.’ The academic, who was sacked from his role as the Government’s chief drugs adviser in 2009 after claiming LSD and ecstasy were less harmful than alcohol, plans to dress up in Victorian costume at the conference to give a talk on whether psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud ‘was wrong to give up on drugs’. Freud argued cocaine could cure heroin addiction – but then became addicted to cocaine himself. For the trial, Professor Nutt wants to recruit 60 patients with depression who have failed to respond to two previous treatments. Half will be given a synthetic form of psilocybin and half a placebo drug. Under current laws, academic researchers are not allowed to manufacture Class A drugs. Companies that could supply the drugs must have a Home Office licence but Professor Nutt said this could take a year and potentially triple the cost of the exercise. Only four hospitals in the UK have a licence to hold psilocybin – and Professor Nutt said the Home Office refused to tell him which they were. Supporter: Lady Neipath said she has been working with Professor Nutt since 1998 . The magic mushrooms trial  was initiated by a charity that lobbies to liberalise the drugs laws and examines links between illegal dugs and creativity. The Beckley Foundation is run by aristocrat Lady Neidpath, who has taken drugs in the past and has said that she considers herself ‘my own best laboratory’. The 69-year-old has worked closely with Professor Nutt’s team, planning the research after providing £50,000 for the work. Lady Neidpath also recently helped secure separate ethical approval for a study investigating the effects of LSD on the brain. This will be carried out by Professor Nutt and his fellow researchers at Imperial College London. The Government’s current drugs tsar, Professor Les Iversen, was criticised for having links to the Beckley Foundation. His profile appears on the foundation’s website along with those of other members of its advisory panel. However, Lady Neidpath said Professor Iversen had not carried out any work with the foundation since his appointment as chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs in 2010 and was not advising the charity. She has been campaigning for 20 years to investigate the therapeutic potential of illegal drugs and has been involved in a collaboration with Johns Hopkins University in the US to use psilocybin to treat nicotine addiction. Yesterday she said: ‘We have  an ongoing association with  the research team at Imperial College and I’ve been working with Professor Nutt since  about 1998. How else can you lessen the harm for people with post-traumatic stress, depression and addiction, and discover the benefits of drugs like LSD and psilocybin? But good things are beginning to happen.’","Professor David Nutt given cash by Medical Research Council .

'It is clear the IRS cannot operate with even a shred of the American people¿s confidence under the current leadership,' Rubio wrote to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew . Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio demanded the resignation of acting IRS commissioner Steven T. Miller on Monday, as President Barack Obama seemed to apologize for the tax agency's targeting of Tea Party organizations and other right-wing groups for special scrutiny before granting them tax-exempt nonprofit status. Americans, Obama said, are 'properly concerned' about what, if true, would be 'outrageous' IRS conduct, and said the bureaucrats responsible would be 'held accountable.' 'You don't want the IRS ever being perceived to be biased, and anything less than neutral, in terms of how they operate,' Obama said during a White House press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron. 'I've got no patience with it, I will not tolerate it, and we will make sure we find out exactly what happened on this,' he told reporters. In a letter to Treasury Secretary . Jack Lew, however, Rubio upped the ante and raised the possibility of . criminal charges being brought against IRS personnel who probed tea . party groups that applied for the right to promise tax deductions to . their financial contributors, or for the right to lobby on a not-for-profit basis. 'The . American people deserve answers about how such seemingly . unconstitutional and potentially criminal behavior could occur, and who . else was aware of it throughout the Administration,' Rubio wrote. 'If . investigations reveal that bureaucrats or political appointees engaged . in unconstitutional or criminal targeting of conservative taxpayers, . they must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.' Scroll down for video . Obama was faced with questions about the performance of his administration's IRS on Monday, allowing that targeting groups for their political views was 'outrageous' Rubio wants a scalp from Acting IRS Commissioner Steven T. Miller (L). A source told MailOnline that Lois Lerner, Director of Exempt Organizations for the IRS, is under investigation. Alan P. Dye, an attorney in . Washington, D.C. who represents nonprofit clients in tax proceedings . with the IRS, told MailOnline that at least six of his clients have been . caught in a 'ridiculous' situation that has delayed their applications . for as long as 30 months. 'They're very pissed off,' he said, 'and they have every right to be pissed off.' Dye, a partner with the firm of Webster, Chamberlain & Bean and a member of the Committee on Exempt Organizations of the Section of Taxation of the American Bar Association, called the situation 'clearly more than just bureaucratic idiocy.' 'Someone made a decision that certain groups should be subject to special scrutiny because of their political views,' Dye alleged, 'The IRS actually has a manual that they are supposed to follow, that says you can't do this.' Dye was referring to questions his clients received from the IRS, after they filed applications for tax exempt status, which demanded the names and contributions amounts of all their financial donors. 'Congress has already decided, in the Internal Revenue Code, that donors shouldn't be disclosed to anyone except for the IRS,' he told MailOnline, 'but everything these groups tell the IRS is open to public inspection once their exempt status is granted.' Tea party protesters demonstrated in 2012 against the US Supreme Court's ruling upholding the constitutionality of Obamacare. Dozens of individual organizations have complained that the IRS treated them differently from liberal or politically neutral groups . Hundreds of small protests, like this one involving The Tea Party Immigration Coalition, have cropped up in 2013 in opposition to the president's immigration reform package - a topic on which Rubio has himself been an approving leader in the Senate . 'With respect to donors, they should . never ask that question. When they ask me for that information, I tell . them they're not getting it. The donors have a right to privacy.' 'Regardless of who's in the White House,' he added, 'I find it personally offensive that anyone in the IRS would do this.' Granting or rejecting tax-exempt status to a nonprofit group should take no more than nine months, Dye said. When the IRS discovered in June 2011 that it was applying a special standard to right-wing groups, he explained, the agency failed to address problems with applications that were already in process. That has left some groups waiting for more than two years. Rubio wrote to Lew that those in the IRS who targeted conservative organizations 'have committed a violation of the public trust that has already had a profoundly chilling effect on free speech. Such behavior cannot be excused with a simple apology.' A Treasury Department source with knowledge of internal matters at the IRS told MailOnline that Lois Lerner, director of exempt organizations for the IRS, is under investigation by the agency's Office of Inspector General. Dye called Lerner 'a relatively low-level person.' She did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Washington, D.C. nonprofit attorney Alan P. Dye (L) said his tea party clients are 'pissed off' at the IRS for making tax decisions according to politics, not by the law . Rubio's spokesman said the senator was traveling and did not have an immediate respond to a questions about whether the senator would accept Lerner's resignation as a sufficient government response to the scandal, which first broke Friday. ABC News has published online a draft timeline that the Office of Inspector General released to selected media outlets. It shows that the IRS began targeting conservative groups for a special level of investigative scrutiny in early 2010. Tea party organizations played a major role in the 2010 midterm congressional elections, turning the tide of dozens of House races and a few Senate contests toward Republicans, and assisting the GOP with ousting Democratic then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi in favor of Ohio Republican John Boehner. Yet Obama said Monday that 'if, in fact, IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that had been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that's outrageous and there's no place for it.' 'And they have to be held fully accountable,' the president added, 'because the IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity.' 'And you should feel that way regardless of party. I don't care whether you're a Democrat, independent or a Republican. At some point, there are going to be Republican administrations. At some point, there are going to be Democratic ones. Either way, you don't want the IRS ever being perceived to be biased and anything less than neutral in terms of how they operate.'","Lawyer on his tea party clients: 'They're very pissed off,' he said, 'and they have every right to be pissed off.'

Sussex Police has become the first force fit patients with GPS tracking devices to save money searching for them when they go missing . Patients with dementia are to be tagged by the police for the first time in a bid to save time and money when they go missing. Sussex Police has become the first force to fit pensioners with GPS tracking devices and hopes the move will save hundreds of thousands of pounds currently spent on extra staff and helicopters. It has bought 15 GPS tags which can be worn around a . patient’s neck, clipped to a belt or attached to a set of house keys. The device sends details of the person's location . to a website every four minutes. As long as the wearer has a mobile signal, they can be located anywhere in the world. There are currently 800,000 people with dementia in the UK and the number is expected to rise to more than a million by 2021. A number of . local authorities are already using similar devices to track sufferers, . but this is believed to be the first time a police force has taken on . such a scheme. But . critics have branded the move as 'completely wrong'. Dot Gibson, . general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, described the . policy as 'barbaric'. She . said: 'I think they should withdraw it straight away. Trying to equate . somebody who has committed a criminal act with somebody who is suffering . dementia is completely wrong. 'I doubt whether anyone in the Cabinet would want their parents dealt with in this way if they were suffering from dementia.' 'If . you've got people in the community who are so bad that they are . wandering off at night and are not safe, they should be properly cared . for, they shouldn't be tagged. 'It's a crude form of monitoring when . the issue needs a much more detailed response than this. This is a . back-of-an-envelope response.' The trial will cost the force £400 a . month, but if successful, will be rolled out across the county, which has a higher than average number of elderly people. The MindMe scheme, as it is known, will . be paid for by Sussex Police but monitored by  Chichester Careline, a company run by . Chichester District Council. The devices cost £27.50 a month, which includes round-the-clock monitoring. A number of local authorities are already using similar devices to track sufferers, but this is believed to be the first time a police force has taken on such a scheme . Sergeant Suzie Mitchell, from . Chichester Neighbourhood Response Team, said: 'The scheme is only . costing Sussex Police a few hundred pounds but comparing this to police . time, resources, potential risk to the missing person let alone the . anxiety and worry for their family, it is in my opinion, a few hundred pounds really well spent.' Eileen Lintill, of Chichester District Council, added that the devices give vulnerable people, and their relatives, peace of mind. She said: 'Hundreds of thousands of . people across the country have dementia. This solution gives both those . with dementia and their families the confidence and reassurance they . need. 'The latest model also allows customers to speak to us directly by pressing a button. 'This can be used by anyone who wants . to maintain their independence, but have the reassurance that someone . is always around to help them.' But Bill Bentley, an East Sussex Conservative councillor who is responsible for adult social care in the region, believes the tracking system could stigmatise dementia patients. He said: 'It’s about getting the balance between a person’s wishes and imposing a technological solution on them that they may or may not wish to have happened.' Joanne Taylor and her mother Anne Grimshaw, who has a GPS tacking device to locate her when she goes missing . Dementia sufferer Anne Grimshaw, 78, has been fitted with a GPS tracking device because she gets lost so often when out walking. The transmitter, known as a Buddi, is attached to her keys and sends out an update of her position every five minutes. If she wanders too far from her bungalow in Rochdale, or suffers a fall, her daughter Joanne Taylor receives a phone call from the Buddi team. Mrs Taylor is also able to log on to her computer or iPad to see a map showing her mother’s exact location. Mrs Taylor said the device, supplied by Rochdale Council’s assisted technology department, had enabled the great-grandmother to retain her independence rather than having to be put in a home. She said: ‘The police once brought her home when she was found on the hard shoulder of the motorway. She doesn’t think there is anything wrong but she gets completely lost. ‘One day she went missing for 12 hours and caused a massive police search. We live near the moors and I was sick with worry.’ Mrs Taylor says others should consider a tracking device for their relatives. ‘There are thousands in my position whose lives would be changed if they knew about Buddi,’ she said. She added: ‘My mother’s independence is key to her and I think your independence is just about everything to you especially if you can live in your own home and be in your own surroundings. ‘But you have got to be safe at the same time. I know my mum would hate being in a home and I believe she would have deteriorated.'","Sussex Police is the first force to monitor dementia patients with GPS .

House Press Secretary Jay Carney stumbled Friday in a routine press briefing . that turned ugly, when reporters asked why a CIA-approved set of talking points . about last year's terror attack on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya . were edited 12 times - seemingly with the influence of Obama administration . political appointees. Carney . took swipes at Republicans and faced hostile questions from a press corps that grew impatient with the . government's answers to questions about the Sept 11, 2012 deadly, al-Qaeda-inspired . mayhem. Many . reporters were equally impatient with the White House Press Office, which . rescheduled the regular daily briefing twice, first holding instead a closed-door . background session with 14 selected reporters. While Carney initially promised that he would remain in the briefing room 'as long as you want' to answer reporters' questions, he left abruptly with many hands still in the air. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . White House spokesman Jay Carney denied Republican accusations of a cover-up in last year's deadly attack in Libya, trying to defuse a renewed political controversy after 12 drafts of a talking-points memo emerged, showing an attempt to omit references to Islamic terrorism in the midst of an election capmaign . Carney slammed Republican 2012 presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, whom he said 'put out a press release to try and take political advantage of these deaths' -- and then corrected himself: 'of the attack in Benghazi' Terrorists . destroyed the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi during the 2012 presidential . campaign, leading Republicans to suggest that downplaying the impact of active . terrorists in Libya was a tactic to deflect concerns that the president was . weak on Islamic terrorism. Responding . to questions about whether the Obama administration sought to avoid those . political consequences, Carney took a shot at Mitt Romney, the president's . opponent. The . former Republican governor of Massachusetts, he said, 'put out a press release . to try and take political advantage of these deaths.' Carney . quickly corrected himself: 'Of the attack in Benghazi.' At . issue is language the CIA prepared for the House Permanent Select Committee on . Intelligence. Its initial draft held, in part, that 'We believe ... the attacks . in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired ... [but] we do know that Islamic . extremists with ties to al Qa'ida participated in the attack.' Twelve . revisions later, and after emailed input from State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, the final version issued Sept. 15 read that 'currently . available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were . spontaneously inspired ... [but] there are indications that extremists . participated in the violent demonstrations.' All . mentions of Islamic terrorism, al-Qaeda and the 'attack' itself were scrubbed . from the talking points by the time US Secretary Susan Rice blamed the deadly . incident on an anti-Islam YouTube video, during five talk show appearances on . Sept. 16. An Obama impeachment? Sen. Jim Inhofe (L) and Daily Beast columnist Michael Tomasky (R) are suggesting that the Benghazi scandal could lead there . Carney . held Friday to his previous statements, insisting that the intelligence . community was solely responsible for the substantive edits. 'The . CIA, in this case deputy director of the CIA ... issued a set of talking points on that Saturday morning,' Carney said, 'and those talking points were . disseminated. And the only edit made by the White House or the State Department . ... was a change in referring to the facility that was attacked as a . ""consulate"" -- because it was not a consulate -- to ""diplomatic . post.""' But . reporters questioned Carney's parsing of words, asking if the State . Department's influence was felt by the CIA, which then adapted its talking . points to suit political appointees. Carney . said the State Department was included in the working group that edited the . CIA's draft, 'since it was a State Department facility that was attacked.' Carney . accused unnamed Republicans of leaking a series of emails to ABC News on . Friday. Those communications, the network reported, spell out the trail of . edits across 12 separate versions of the talking points. The . White House, he said, provided the emails in question to the U.S. Senate months . ago, in response to a request related to the confirmation of the incoming CIA . director, John Brennan. 'The . administration took the rather extraordinary step of providing those emails' to . senators 'in late February and through March,' Carney said. Senate Republicans . voted to confirm Brennan after seeing 'all of these emails which, of course, . now they've leaked to reporters.' State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's emails show that the agency, then headed by Hillary Clinton, had a direct hand in suggesting alterations to the official story on the Benghazi terror attack . ABC News uncovered 12 versions of the infamous Benghazi talking points, along with emails suggesting that Nuland - then Hillary Clinton's chief spokesperson - was chiefly interested in political considerations less than two months before the presidential elections . Although . Republicans have called on the White House to release unclassified versions of . all internal administration emails related to what they term a Benghazi . 'cover-up,' Carney said the administration would not comply. 'Internal . deliberations are generally protected information,' he noted. The . Freedom of Information Act includes a list of nine exceptions to government . transparency rules, including the provision that 'a privileged inter-agency or . intra-agency memorandum or letter' need not be disclosed. But . it's unclear whether that rule applies to Congress, or whether Republicans on . Capitol Hill will drop the now-intensely politicized issue. Four Americans . perished in the terror attack on Benghazi, including then-Ambassador to Libya . Chris Stevens. He . conceded that one feature of the talking points, its claim that spontaneous . demonstrations preceded the Benghazi terror attack, turned out to be flawed. But reporters focused more on sins of omission on which the White House is now . referring questions to the CIA. 'You . should direct those questions to the intelligence community,' Carney said after . one journalist asked whether the CIA's first draft - which included references . to al-Qaeda - was accurate before it was edited. These bloodstains at the main gate of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya are believed to belong to an American staff member. Four U.S. personnel, including ambassador Chris Stevens, died in the Sept. 11, 2012 terror attack . The normally unflappable Jay Carney seemed to struggle Friday to answer questions, in a hostile briefing that was delayed twice and pushed near the end of the work day when most of the day's news cycle was over . It's . an open question whether the White House will be able to rest blame for the . ultimately flawed talking points with intelligence agencies despite the State . Department's now-documented influence over the process. But . one reporter was heard in the press briefing room after Carney departed, . speculating about applying the press secretary's standard of responsibility to . his cooking. 'So . if I have this soup recipe that I know is great, and my wife tells me over and . over to put different things into it instead, and I do what she asks, and then . it turns out awful, whose fault is it?' the reporter, who asked not to be . named, said. Indeed, . Carney said 'No' when asked if he could deny that the second and subsequent CIA . drafts of the Benghazi talking points came after input from the State . Department. But . 'these are talking points,' he reflected. 'Not policy.'","Pressure mounts as a Republican senator and a liberal columnist both road-test the word 'impeachment'

The Lebanese man - who is also a tattoo artist nicknamed the 'master of tattoos' by his clients - was also sentenced to one year in prison for tattooing women by the Jeddah District Court. The hairdresser was caught  by members of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (A Hai'a) in an undercover sting operation in the western city's Al-Rawdah district. The Lebanese beautician visited the homes of Saudi women to cut their hair, apply their make-up, and even tattoo them (file photo) He was stopped while walking into what he thought was a client's house with hair dyes and scissors, according to the Saudi Gazette. Strict gender segregation is enforced between men and women that are not married or related in the conservative Gulf kingdom. The unnamed man claimed the products and . tools were for use in his hairdressing shop in Lebanon, but . investigators from the Investigation and Prosecution Bureau in Jeddah . later found text messages from female customers on his mobile phone, as . well as images of women with tattoos and business cards. Tattoos are not officially banned in Saudi, but they are not in keeping with Islamic tradition (file photo) His bags were also reported to contain breast firming and skin whitening creams. The expat, who had been working in Saudi for nine years on a business visa, initially operated out of an apartment but began visiting clients in their homes after starting to suspect that he was under surveillance. He was caught when the Hai'a enlisted the help of an undercover policeman to pose as the driver of a potential client. The hairdresser was then arrested as he entered the supposed home of the new 'customer'. Prosecutors are understood to be seeking a tougher sentence for the beautician. Tattoos are not officially banned in Saudi, but they are not in keeping with Islamic tradition. The kingdom's feared religious police patrol the streets enforcing rules including dress codes and the strict separation of men and women.","Man caught after undercover operation by the kingdom's religious police .

"By . Martyn Halle And Jo Macfarlane . PUBLISHED: . 18:18 EST, 23 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:03 EST, 24 February 2013 . Student nurse Barbara Allatt was kicked off her university course when she highlighted problems in hospitals . A student nurse who blew the whistle on the appalling care of  elderly patients at Stafford Hospital was disciplined and is still blocked from completing her course – while staff she complained about continue to work in the NHS. Barbara Allatt, 43, reported her concerns over poor care and patient neglect to her university tutors, hospital mentors and senior nurses. But she found herself facing a fitness-to-practise panel at the University of Stafford’s school of nursing, which threw her off her course. She has since lost two appeals against the decision and, three years later, her place remains permanently withdrawn. Despite her role in raising concerns, she remains the only health professional to be disciplined at Mid Staffs NHS Trust, where there were between 400 and 1,200 unnecessary deaths from 2005 to 2008. Ms Allatt, from Cannock, Staffordshire, now plans to take her case to the European Court of Human Rights in an attempt to change whistleblowing legislation to ensure student nurses are also protected. She is being supported by the Royal College of Nursing. Her case comes amid the growing furore over the silencing of NHS whistleblowers that has broken out  in response to the Mid Staffordshire scandal. Gary Walker, who was sacked as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, claimed this month he was handed a £500,000 pay-off but was prevented from airing his concerns about patient safety. Nearly 600 more doctors, nurses and managers have been paid a total of £15 million in ‘special severance payments’ during the past three years, the latest figures reveal. Ms Allatt blew the whistle on Stafford Hospital but instead of being rewarded was blocked from finishing her course . Mother-of-one Ms Allatt said: ‘Because I wasn’t employed by the NHS and was still a student, I have no right of appeal within the Health Service and I can’t go to an industrial tribunal. ‘If they want to keep me out of the job I love, it seems there is nothing I can do about it. Gary Walker, former Hospital chief executive for United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS trust, was prevented from airing his concerns . ‘What sickens me is that the nurses who neglected and abused patients appear to have got away with what they did. There doesn’t seem to be any justice in a situation where I did the right thing and have been punished all these years.’ Ms Allatt was working as an occupational therapy technician when she began her nursing diploma at the  University of Stafford in 2009. The course included placements on the wards at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, which includes Cannock Chase and Stafford Hospitals. The scandal over poor care at Stafford had already emerged but what Ms Allatt experienced on the wards suggested it was still going on. While at Cannock Hospital she reported seeing a nurse putting tablets in a patient’s tea and patient hygiene being neglected. During a placement at Stafford Hospital she reported patients left in soiled sheets and nurses mocking patients. Julie Bailey, of Cure the NHS, which campaigns for better NHS care, said: ‘We desperately need people like her in the NHS. Somebody should be doing something to make sure she can resume her training.’ A spokesman for Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘An investigation was carried out into Ms Allatt’s complaints and came to a natural conclusion that there was no case to answer.’ A Staffordshire University spokesman said: ‘We remain committed to whistle-blowing and to supporting our students through the process.’","Barbara Allatt blew the whistle on Stafford Hospital three years ago .

All 50 U.S. states should lower the alcohol limit for drivers to 0.05 per cent, the National Transportation Safety Board voted today. The top transportation safety agency is advancing its campaign to cut down on drinking-related road deaths through a stricter definition of impairment. At a meeting in Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) called on state authorities to reduce the legal limit by nearly 40 per cent. Lowering DUI limits: The NTSB called on state authorities to reduce the legal limit by nearly 40 percent to 0.05 percent (library image) Should the DUI limit be lowered to 0.05% across the U.S? All 50. states now have a blood alcohol content (BAC) limit of 0.08 percent for drivers aged 21 and over, and younger drivers are held to stricter standards. The NTSB has no authority to change the state laws but its backing of the lower limit could add pressure on regulators to adopt the 0.05 percent rule. 'This is critical because impaired driving remains one of the biggest killers in the United States', NTSB chairman Deborah Hersman said. 'To make a bold difference will require bold action. But it can be done', she added. But The American Beverage Institute, which represents 8,000 restaurants, hit back at the report to lower the limit. The institute told USA Today: 'The average woman reaches 0.05 per cent blood-alcohol content after one drink. But more than 70 per cent of drunk-driving fatalities are caused by drivers with at least 0.15 per cent, representing six or seven drinks.' The institute's managing director, Sarah Longwell, added: 'This recommendation is ludicrous. Further restricting the moderate consumption of alcohol by responsible adults prior to driving does nothing to stop hard-core drunk drivers from getting behind the wheel.' NTSB has launched a 'Reaching Zero' campaign to help avert alcohol-related accidents and increase public awareness about the dangers of drinking and driving. Alcohol-impaired driving causes an estimated 10,000 deaths per year in the United States, making up 30 percent of all U.S. highway deaths, according to the NTSB. In a 2011 survey by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, more than 14 percent of U.S. drivers admitted to driving when they thought they were close to or over the legal limit.","NTSB want to reduce the limit by nearly 40% - it is currently 0.08% .

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney denied on Wednesday that the Obama administration was prohibiting any U.S. personnel who survived last year's attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya from testifying before Congress about what they experienced. But a lawyer representing one of those potential whistle-blowers is insisting that the White House is stonewalling congressional requests for their testimony. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee announced earlier in the day that it will convene a hearing on May 8 aimed at 'exposing failure' in the Obama administration to respond o security threats to that diplomatic mission, and to present to the public and to Congress an accurate version of the attack that left U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans dead. 'This Administration has offered the American people only a carefully selected and sanitized version of events from before, during, and after the Benghazi terrorist attacks, committee chairman Darrell Issa, a Republican congressman from California, said in a statement Wednesday. 'Not surprisingly, this version of events casts senior officials in the most favorable light possible.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jay Carney insisted in a press briefing that no administration employees had sought security clearances so they could testify about he Benghazi raid, even after the House Oversight Committee asked for those very clearances . Issa's committee has already shed public light on the U.S. State Department's denials of requests for more robust security at the consulate in Benghazi. And in an October 2012 hearing, it produced evidence contradicting the administration's initial claim that the the Sept. 11, 2012 military-style assault on the diplomatic compound began as a 'protest' sparked by a low-budget YouTube video that lampooned the Muslim prophet Muhammad. 'Next week’s hearing will expose new facts and details that the Obama Administration has tried to suppress,' Issa said. At least four surviving witnesses to the Benghazi attack have retained attorneys to help them navigate the process of testifying before Congress about what they saw. They are all employees of the CIA and the State Department, according to a Fox News report. The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya was attacked and burned on Sept. 11, 2012 in a military-style attack that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans . California Republican Rep> Darrell Issa (L) has announced a hearing in which the House Oversight committee, which he chairs, will hear testimony from survivors who say they have been blocked from telling Congress what they know. South Caroline Rep. Trey Gowdy (R) has promised that the Benghazi attack is 'not going away despite the efforts of this [Obama] administration' Attorney Victoria Toensing said Tuesday that she is representing one of them, a man who has been cowed into silence under threats of damage to his career. President Obama denied on Tuesday that he was aware of any U.S. personnel who were being prevented from sharing their observations with congressional investigators. 'I'm not familiar with this notion that anybody has been blocked from testifying,” the president said in response to a reporter's question, 'so what I’ll do is I will find out what exactly you’re referring to.' Both the CIA and the State Department have told Congress that no employees have requested the security clearances that their lawyers would need before talking to Congress. And on Wednesday, Obama's chief spokesman Jay Carney insisted during a White House press briefing that 'Benghazi happened a long time ago,' and that 'we are unaware of any agency blocking an employee who would like to appear before Congress to provide information related to Benghazi.' Attorney Victoria Toensing represents a survivor of the Benghazi attack whom she says the Obama administration has blocked from testifying by refusing to give her the necessary security clearance to learn what her own client knows . But Toensing, a former Justice Department official and Republican counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Fox News that administration officials are issuing 'some very despicable threats to people ... They're taking career people and making them well aware . that their careers will be over' if they testify. The State Department, she said during a separate Fox News interview, has 'had two letters from Chairman Issa, one on April 16, the other one April 26, that specifically say, ""We want you to provide a process for clearing a lawyer to receive classified information.""' 'How can they possibly get up there and just lie to the press corps?' she asked, referring to the . president and his spokespersons. Toensing, according to her law partner who was interviewed Wednesday on ABC radio affiliate WMAL in Washington, already possesses a Top Secret clearance, and would only need a letter from an administration attorney in order to learn what her client already knows. That law partner, former U.S. Attorney Joe DiGenova, explained on Monday that 'the Department of State is refusing to grant clearances to Victoria and other people who want to represent the whistle-blowers, in an attempt to prevent the testimony.' The FBI released these photos on Wednesday of individuals who sere seen near the Benghazi consulate on the day Libyan terrorists attack it, killing four Americans including the U.S. ambassador. The raid on that diplomatic outpost happened eight months ago . House Republicans issued a scathing report on April 23 criticizing the Obama administration for a series of intelligence failures and an attempted cover-up after the Benghazi raid. When then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified before Congress, she disputed that it was important to determine whether the raid was carried out by terrorist militants or by an angry group of protesters, as the administration first claimed . 'On April 26, Congressman Issa sent a letter to the new Sec of State, John Kerry, demanding that the lawyers who are going to represent the whistle-blowers be cleared - be given clearances - so they can talk to their clients and the committee about classified information,' DiGenova said. 'She got a new Top Secret security clearance within the last year. And now they will not clear her or any of the other lawyers to represent the Department of State people. This is so outrageous.' 'There is going to be a Constitutional showdown here,' he predicted,' and 'Congress is going to win. The administration's effort to cover up whatever happened in Benghazi is going to fail.' 'The whistle-blowers are out there,' DiGenova insisted. 'These are great Americans. These are heroes. They were on the ground in Benghazi. They want to tell their story and the administration is going to do everything it can to stop them from testifying under oath in public. And they want to protect Hillary [Clinton] and the president. That's what this is all about.' South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, who serves on the House oversight committee, said Wednesday that he was 'not at liberty to disclose the identity of the witnesses' who will appear at next week's hearing. 'Benghazi is warming up,' Gowdy promised during a televised interview. 'It is not going away despite the efforts of this administration.' Joe DiGenova, shown here in a file photo, said Benghazi survivors 'want to tell their story and the [Obama] administration is going to do everything it can to stop them.'","White House Press Secretary insisted that no government employees were being blocked from testifying about the 2012 Benghazi consulate attack .

The closure of four major Accident and Emergency units is set to be approved this week, forcing hundreds of thousands of seriously ill patients to travel further for emergency care. The units across North-West London will be scrapped and replaced by Urgent Care Centres once the proposals are formally approved at a board meeting of NHS officials on Tuesday. There has been huge opposition from doctors and patients during a public consultation period, and campaigners argue that residents in some of the most deprived areas of the capital will be put at risk. Hammersmith Hospital in North West London is one of the four to be losing its A&E department . Central Middlesex Hospital's A&E department is being downgraded to an Urgent Care Centre . The downgraded departments will be prevented from treating a huge array of life-threatening illnesses, such as shock, internal bleeding, most broken bones, breathing problems, heart attacks and strokes. The A&Es earmarked for closure are at Ealing, Central Middlesex, Charing Cross and Hammersmith  hospitals. Just four major hospitals with fully functioning casualty wards will remain, serving 1.9 million people. It is estimated that each of the remaining A&Es, which are already struggling to cope, will see attendances rise by 50 per cent. The closure recommendations are contained in papers for Tuesday’s board meeting of NHS North West London. A&E departments at Charing Cross (left) and Ealing (right) face closures in preference of Urgent Care Centres . However, there is evidence that the UCCs already in place in the area – which are being run by private  providers – are seriously failing patients. Responses to Freedom of Information requests reveal that one confused patient attending Ealing Hospital’s UCC in February last year had his emergency treatment delayed by four hours after locum staff did not realise how ill he was. And in a data protection breach, confidential medical notes for six children treated at the UCC, which were intended for their GPs, were sent to the wrong fax number. Colin Standfield, chairman of the Save Our Hospitals campaign in Ealing, said: ‘It does confirm our worst fears that they have closed the four A&Es they wanted to close in the first place, and it’s become even more clear that the main rationale for this is to sell off land for residential development. All this comes in the face of  massive opposition.’ A statement from the consultants’ group at Ealing Hospital said: ‘We, as frontline consultants, do not feel comfortable with the speed at which changes are being made, the great loss of capacity for inpatient beds in London, and lengthening A&E queues. ‘Overwhelmingly it seems difficult to appreciate how these changes are anything other than financially driven.’ Ealing Council has suggested it could seek a judicial review if Ealing Hospital’s A&E department is closed. But Dr Mark Spencer, medical director of NHS North West London, said: ‘I have no doubts at all that the care we will be providing will be better than it is currently.’","Departments downgraded to no longer treat heart attack or stroke patients .

The attorneys for Cleveland abduction suspect Ariel Castro claim that he's not the 'monster' depicted in news reports - and he will plead not guilty to kidnapping and rape charges. Castro, 52, was arrested on May 6, and accused of holding three captives - Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus - in his home for about a decade. Speaking out for the first time today, Castro's legal team says that he will plead not guilty to the charges, and that despite the charges, he is not the man portrayed in the media. Horrific crimes: Ariel Castro, 52, is charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape . Claims: Lawyers for Ariel Castro say that he's not the 'monster' being portrayed in the media, but a loving dad to his daughter Jocelyn, whom authorities say is his daughter with Amanda Berry, center . Survivors: Michelle Knight, left,  and Gina DeJesus, right, were in worse condition then Amanda Berry when they emerged from at least nine years in captivity - allegedly at the hands of Castro . Castro's lawyer, Craig Weintraub, told WKYC-TV: 'The initial portrayal by the media has . been one of a 'monster' and that's not the impression that I got when I . talked to him for three hours. 'I know that family members who have been interviewed by the media have expressed that as well.' Mr Weintraub denies reports that Castro has cooperated with authorities and provided some details in the abduction of the three women after his arrest. He told the station that the facts surrounding how the women came to be in his home will be revealed during Castro's trial. Scene: A 10-foot fence has been erected around Ariel Castro's now-boarded up house on Seymour Avenue . Lawyer: Ariel Castro's attorney Craig Weintraub says that the facts surrounding how the women came to be in Castro's home will be revealed during the trial . He said: 'That fact will be disclosed as the case progresses. I am aware of how he came into contact with them.' Castro's other defense attorney, Jaye Schlachet, says that there is nothing his client cares about more than his six-year-old daughter Jocelyn, whom he is alleged to have had with victim Amanda Berry. He told WKYC: 'I can tell you that Mr . Castro is extremely committed to the well-being and positive future for . his daughter, who he loves dearly. Man of 'monster'?: A report says that Castro had no interest in having children with Michelle Knight, because she was only 4-foot-7 and believed her to be 'mentally disabled' 'And if people find that to be a disconnect from what he's alleged to have done, then the people will just have to deal with it. We just know how he feels about his little girl.' Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were in worse condition than Amanda Berry when they emerged from at least nine years in captivity at the home of Ariel Castro, accused of kidnapping and raping the women. Castro appeared to treat Berry - his 'favorite' - better than the other two, the sources said. 'There is a reason why you have only seen a picture of Amanda,' said one of the sources, referring to the condition of DeJesus and Knight. Knight told investigators she fell pregnant five times, but lost the baby each time. She said that Castro starved and repeatedly punched her in the stomach to force her to miscarry. Police sources told the National Enquirer that Castro had no interest in having children with Knight, because she was only 4-foot-7 and believed her to be 'mentally disabled.' The magazine's source added that he was grooming his 6-year-old daughter with Amanda, Joselyn, as another sex slave because the other captives 'were getting to old for him.'

Monica Stephens - who was at one point married to Castro's son, Anthony - told CNN's . Piers Morgan that she once visited the home on Seymour Avenue, and was . struck by how Castro would 'obsessively' keep things locked up.

An Ohio prosecutor last week vowed to try to bring murder charges that could carry the death penalty against Ariel Castro. Those charges would stem from forced miscarriages that police say were suffered by one of his victims. The initial police report on the case said that at least five times after impregnating Knight, Ariel Castro starved and beat her in the abdomen to induce miscarriages.","Castro, 52, is charged with rape and kidnapping connected to the abduction of Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus .

James Hackett, 26, left, allegedly threw an order of 'hot and oily' fries at his 11-year-old stepdaughter . According to the Smoking Gun, Hackett’s wife and stepdaughter had picked him up from work and were taking him to the Golden Arches for a meal. Once they had the food in their vehicle, Hackett and his wife began arguing about money matters. Though the police report says the argument over money ‘did not get physical,’ things rapidly escalated. The 11-year-old girl was sitting in the back seat, apparently trying to mediate between the two. That’s when Hackett allegedly pulled out the order of fries and threw it at his stepdaughter, ‘striking her in the face and chest,’ the police report states. The report notes that the girl was not seriously injured by the attack, but that throwing hot French fries at someone’s face could lead to burns and other injuries.

He next appears in court in August, and is forbidden to have contact with his stepdaughter between now and then, the Lowell Sun reported. Massachusetts law defines assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon as ‘an instrument of offensive or defensive combat…anything used or designed to be used in destroying, defeating, or injuring an enemy.’ It goes on to say: ‘An item that is normally used for innocent purposes can become a dangerous weapon if it is intentionally used in a way that it reasonably appears to be capable of causing serious injury or death to another person.’","James Hackett got into argument with wife over money .

A U.S. soldier, who pleaded guilty to shooting dead five fellow servicemen at a combat stress clinic in Iraq, killed his comrades with premeditation, a military judge said on Monday in a ruling that will almost surely get him life in prison. U.S. Army Sergeant John Russell, in a deal that spared him the death penalty, pleaded guilty last month to killing two medical staff officers and three soldiers at Camp Liberty in Baghdad in a 2009 shooting that the military has said may have been triggered by combat stress. Russell, of Sherman, Texas, faced an abbreviated court-martial at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state to determine the level of his guilt and whether he acted with premeditation, as prosecutors said, or on impulse, as the defense has argued. The judge in the case, Army Colonel David Conn, asked Russell, who appeared at a brief morning hearing in green military dress, to stand and gave his ruling. He did not provide further details. Killed in the 2009 shooting in Baghdad were Navy Cmdr. Charles Springle, of Wilmington, N.C., and four Army service members: Pfc. Michael Edward Yates Jr., of Federalsburg, Md.; Dr. Matthew Houseal, of Amarillo, Texas; Sgt. Christian E. Bueno-Galdos, of Paterson, N.J.; and Spc. Jacob D. Barton, of Lenox, Mo. Russell's state of mind before, during and after the attack, one of the worst incidents of soldier-on-soldier violence in the Iraq war, has been central to legal proceedings over the past year at the Pacific Northwest military base. Russell's lawyers argued that he was deluded by depression and despair at the time. An Army mental health board found that Russell suffered from severe depression with psychotic features and post-combat stress. Russell had long sought help with sleep troubles and was stammering and crying for help in the days before the shooting. Killed in the attack: (from left) Pfc. Michael Edward Yates Jr., Cmdr. Charles Keith Springle, and Maj Matthew P. Houseal . Victims: (From left to right) Spc. Jacob D. Barton, 20, of Lenox, Mo. and Sgt. Christian E. Bueno-Galdos, died May 11, 2009 at Camp Liberty, Baghdad, Iraq . His commanders were so alarmed that they disarmed him and sent him for repeated visits to mental health clinics, said attorney James Culp. But prosecutors argued that Russell . was trying to paint himself as mentally ill in an attempt to win early . retirement — just as he was facing a sexual harassment complaint that . could derail his career and his benefits. The day before the killings, . psychiatrist Michael Jones told him that a mental disability retirement . would require 'some kind of suicidal psychotic crisis,' Maj. Daniel . Mazzone said during closing arguments, according to the Los Angeles . Times. But when Russell saw Jones again the . next day, the psychiatrist said he had no intention of giving him 'a . golden ticket' out of the Army. In his ruling, the judge ultimately . sided with prosecutors who said Russell tried to gain a quick exit from . the Army and had then sought revenge on a mental health worker who would . not help him achieve that goal. Cout-martial: oldiers assisting with communications and security tasks stand outside the building at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash., where the court-martial for U.S. Army Sgt. John Russell was held . The . mandatory sentence for even one count of premeditated murder is life in . prison, and at issue going forward is whether Russell will ever be . eligible for parole. Both sides will present arguments, and Conn is . likely to rule on that by week's end. Prosecutors have argued that Russell had more than 40 minutes to consider his actions as he drove to the clinic in a stolen Ford SUV and M16-A2 rifle, and witnesses have testified to how he removed identification tags and the gun's optic, and had a stone-faced demeanor as he stalked to the clinic. An Army forensic science officer who analyzed the scene after the attack testified that Russell killed with the tactical precision of a trained soldier. Defense attorneys said Russell's mental health, severely weakened by several combat tours, deteriorated further and that he was suicidal prior to the attack and provoked to violence by maltreatment at the hands of healthcare workers he sought for help at Camp Liberty. A forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Robert Sadoff of the University of Pennsylvania, concluded that Russell suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and psychosis at the time of the shootings and had death wishes related to his illnesses.","Army Sergeant John Russell suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and psychosis at the time of the shootings .

Lori Garver, NASA’s deputy administrator, said as she unveiled the contract award that the inflatable module concept is simultaneously cutting edge technology and affordable. ‘This partnership agreement for the use of expandable habitats represents a step forward in cutting-edge technology that can allow humans to thrive in space safely and affordably, and heralds important progress in U.S. commercial space innovation,’ she said. ‘The International Space Station is a unique laboratory that enables important discoveries that benefit humanity and vastly increase understanding of how humans can live and work in space for long periods.’ Part of NASA’s interest in the inflatable technology is prompted by its potential for deep space missions. The experimental unit, the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, is intended to be easily launched because it takes up much less room than conventional space craft yet once in orbit is inflated to be much bigger. Bigelow hopes that while providing practical solutions to space research, the modules will also serve as craft that can provide accommodation and working space for astronauts in orbit. The inflatable unit seen in comparison to one of the International Space Station modules. Two or more inflatables could be linked up to provide extra working and living space. Its stated aim is ‘to provide affordable options for spaceflight to national space agencies and corporate clients’. Previously, the company has launched two other inflatable modules but this is the first time it will be tested as part of a manned craft. Genesis 1 was launched in in 2006 and Genesis 2 in 2007, both on Russian rockets, and are still in orbit. Echo 1, launched in 1960 was the first inflatable space craft. The NASA communication satelite rose 1,000 miles into space as a balloon. It was dubbed a ‘sateloon’. In 1961 an inflatable space station was proposed and a prototype built by NASA. It was intended to be manned by one or two astronauts but it was never launched. With the development of kelvar and other materials, the inflatable concept was revived in the 1990s, with NASA creating the TransHab. Budget cuts meant it was scrapped in 2000. Each has been tested to ensure a constant temperature and pressure can be maintained within the inflatable hull. Bigelow last year announced a link up with the SpaceX company which is working to create Dragon spacecraft that can carry passengers into space. The intention was that SpaceX would transport people into space where they would transfer to orbiting Bigelow inflatables. Among the potential projects that Bigelow is looking at is building a base on the moon constructed from a series of linked inflatable modules. Initially it would be expected that inflatable Moon bases would be for research but with several companies planning to take tourists into orbit they could eventually be used as 'space hotels'.","Inflatable modules hailed as cheaper to launch and transport .

'It's the worst thing I have ever done...Before that . day I wouldn't even want to harm a spider.' Listing ways that she could contribute positively from prison, Arias promised to teach women how to speak Spanish and to help improve literacy among inmates, as well as start a book club. Arias also noted that she has avoided looking at Alexander's family during the trial. 'It's never been my intention to throw mud on Travis's name,' she said. 'I loved Travis and I looked up to him. At one point, he was the world to me.' She choked up as she spoke about the impact of her crime on her own family, saying they would be destroyed if she was sentenced to death.

In closing statements later Tuesday, Defense attorney Jennifer Willmott asked the jury to consider that 'people are far better than their very worst deed.' She claimed that Jodi's personality disorder and alleged emotional abuse that she observed between her mother and father 'is in no way an excuse for killing [Travis Alexander],' but they could have contributed to her crime and should therefore be considered when weighing the death penalty. 'While what she did was absolutely horrible, you have convicted her of that,' Willmott said. 'Two wrongs do not make a right.' 'Jodi can still contribute to this world. Her life still has value,' she continued. 'We are asking you to find that Jodi's life is worth saving.'

Passengers whose cruise aboard a Royal Caribbean vessel was cut short by a massive on-board fire have begun arriving back in Baltimore on charter flights from the Bahamas. The  2,224 cruise passengers were forced to abandon their rooms after the massive fire broke out on the Grandeur of the Seas  on Monday morning as it made its way to the Bahamas. Passengers . began flying back to Maryland on 11 flights chartered by the cruise . line, while 25 passengers who did not want to fly were provided other . transportation. And while many holidaymakers have told how they feared the ship was going to sink, the passengers arriving in Baltimore on Tuesday afternoon grinned and applauded the company's service. 'I'll never go on any other cruise line,' said Craig Dzubak, 26, of Pittsburgh, who was on his first cruise. 'They couldn't have handled it any better.' Returning home: Passengers from the Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas cruise ship, which caught fire during its voyage to the Bahamas, arrive on a charter flight at Baltimore on Tuesday . Smooth: At the airport, a woman directs passengers, who praised the cruise line for their response . He said he and his wife, Chelsea, were planning their next cruise while on the flight home. Robert Alexander of Hamilton, New Jersey, said he was impressed by how well-prepared everyone on board was for emergencies. An actor from the ship's theater made announcements to passengers after they were evacuated from their rooms, he said. 'It just shows the training they do,' Alexander said. 'Our head waiter at our dinner table was one of the first responders' to the fire. Earlier, startling photos of the ship had emerged . on social networking sites showing the entire stern of the vessel charred and . destroyed, as passengers recounted their terrifying experiences. 'I heard these big explosions and saw the fire jump out of the ship,' passenger Dan McTigue told ABC News. 'We couldn't get to the muster station because it was on fire.' 'I started crying,' his granddaughter Sophia said. 'I thought we were gonna die.' Passengers report that amid the chaos life preservers were distributed to several people as they waited in safety areas . The fire broke out on deck 3 and was quickly extinguished but the damage caused Royal Caribbean to cancel the cruise bound for the Bahamas . Damage: The blaze wiped out the stern of the Grandeur of the Seas as well as a bar and the resturant . No cause for the fire has been revealed, and authorities continue to investigate. A bar and a restaurant were also destroyed by the flames, which reached four decks. Royal Caribbean said that the blaze began at 2.50am and was extinguished about two hours later with no injuries reported. They said all 2,224 guests and 796 crew were safe and accounted for. Royal Caribbean announced that the 2,224 passengers would be receiving a full refund and a gift certificate from the company. The company is also organizing flights for all passengers. Twenty five passengers who do not want to fly will take a ferry to Fort Lauderdale, and then the train or bus to Baltimore, the company said on Twitter. Bang Warren, one of the passengers who had to evacuate her room as a warning horn blared over the sound system, described the chaotic scene  to The Baltimore Sun. 'A lot of people were passing out with fear,' she said. She added that she saw crew members distributing oxygen masks and life vests: 'I know some children were vomiting.' Grandeur of the Seas passenger Danielle Miller initially thought the ship was sinking as she filmed this footage . South Jersey resident Jennifer Allen filmed the moment when lifeboats were lowered into the ocean as the Royal Caribbean cruise ship Grandeur of the Seas caught fire on Monday morning . Waiting game: The passengers were given life jackets and told to wait in muster stations on the ship . Another passenger, Danielle Miller, . 23, said that she was sound asleep and was unaware of anything untoward . until the ship's intercom asked passengers to put life jackets on. 'My first thought was that we were sinking,' said Danielle of her terror. 'I . opened the door and just see people running around with life jackets on . and we were being yelled at to get our life jackets on and run up to a . deck that was two floors above us,' she told ABC News. 'But . we didn't know what was going on because when we were going to bed it . was really stormy, so we honestly thought the boat might have been . sinking. And we were just panicking and running upstairs. 'And we didn't know for about a half hour that there was a fire two decks below where we were at.' Path of disaster: A map shows the cruise ship's ill-fated route from Baltimore to the Bahamas . The ship was forced to dock in Freeport, Grand Bahama island as the fire damage was assessed . According to several passenger accounts nobody was seriously injured but the fire did cause smoke and flooding . Miller revealed she was so nervous as the fire raged that her hands were shaking and her heart was pounding. 'A couple people fainted. People were throwing up, crying. Just anxiety attacks everywhere. I was just telling my roommate stay calm,' she said. Royal Caribbean said that two guests were treated after fainting, and medical staff responded to reports of high blood pressure and an ankle sprain. Nathan Pletscher spoke to ABC News to . explain how he became nervous for his parents aboard the ship only . after he looked at a photo tweeted by Royal Caribbean's public relations . team. 'We originally saw a news article and . were a little nervous. When we made contact with my parents, they said . there was a small fire,' he said.

'When I saw the photo on Twitter, I said, ""That . was a little more than a small fire."" It's really fortunate the crew was . able to get fire under control and things of that nature.' Speaking to the news network, . Pletscher admitted that his parents had a 'sense of panic' and had . become 'obviously nervous', but were calmed by the ships crew. 'When the alarm first went off, there . was an 'uh-oh' moment,' Pletscher said. 'But they couldn't say enough . about how organized and professional both the captain and crew were. They kept everyone calm and were extremely transparent on with the whole . situation.'

Panic on the High Seas: Royal Caribbean said all guests and 796 crew were safe and accounted for . Royal Caribbean has said they are in the process of arranging flights for the 2,224 guests currently aboard the ship . Firefighter Brian Goss, a passenger on the ship, told WOOD-TV that some of the cabins experienced flooding and that the hallways smelled of smoke for most of the morning. But he praised the efforts of the company, and said they were working tirelessly on the situation: 'Up all night in emergency mode and now serving food and drinks with smiling faces and no sleep.' An announcement from the Royal Caribbean cruise ship that passengers needed to go their muster stations roused Mark J. Ormesher from his stateroom on the Grandeur of the Seas early Monday. Ormesher said in an email to The Associated Press that immediately after the captain's announcement, his room attendant knocked on the door and told him and his girlfriend to grab their flotation devices, saying: 'This was not a drill.' The native of England, who lives in Manassas, Virginia, Ormesher said he and his girlfriend smelled acrid smoke as they went to their muster station, the ship's casino. He said the crew quickly provided instruction. A provided by Royal Caribbean shows the fire-damaged exterior on the Grandeur of the Seas cruise ship . The company in a statement on its website said it is 'deeply sorry for this unexpected development in our guests' vacation. We understand that this may have been a very stressful time for them' 'This encouraged calm amongst the passengers,' he said. Passengers were required to remain at their stations for four hours, he said, and the captain 'provided us as much information as we needed to stay safe.' Ormesher, 25, and on his first cruise, said the air conditioner had been shut off, and as the hours passed and the ship got hot, bottled water was passed around. The crew and passengers remained calm, and helped those who needed it. Crying babies were given formula and held while their parents used the bathrooms. After passengers . were allowed to leave their stations, Ormesher said he saw water on the . outside of deck 5 and in the hallways.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 10:45 EST, 25 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:57 EST, 26 April 2013 . A driver who killed a girl in a hit-and-run 45 years ago has finally been identified after a Facebook campaign. Carolee Sadie Ashby, four, was crossing the street in her upstate New York hometown of Fulton on Halloween night when she was fatally struck. Thanks to a retired detective’s Facebook post, authorities provided an answer on Wednesday. The culprit is a man who police say misled them when questioned about the girl’s death at the time and then sat on the secret for more than four decades. Douglas Parkhurst, 62, of the town of Oswego, New York has been identified as the driver of a car that failed to stop after hitting her. No answers: Carolee Sadie Ashby, four, was killed in 1968 in Fulton, New York after being struck by a hit-and-run driver who never came forward . Parkhurst won’t be charged because the statute of limitations has expired, police said. An Oswego County phone number for him has been disconnected. The girl, her sister and a cousin were returning from a neighborhood store after buying candles for the sibling’s 15th birthday when Carolee was hit. The other two weren’t hurt, but Carolee later died from her injuries. Parkhurst was questioned at the time when police learned he had been in an accident that same night. He confirmed a crash, but said it occurred in the neighboring town of Volney, police said. Although his claims that he had hit a guard post didn’t match up with the damage to his vehicle, Parkhurst wasn’t questioned again, police said. The mystery endured for nearly a half-century. Police checked out hundreds of leads over the years and reopened of the case in 2000, but the break came early last year after retired Fulton police Lt. Russ Johnson posted details of the case on a local history Facebook page. Crime scene: The family of the little girl have spent the past 45 years wondering who was responsible for her death . According to Fulton police, a former resident now living in Florida saw the posting and came forward with new information. The woman, who police did not identify, told police that she was approached by a member of the Parkhurst family soon after the accident and asked to say she was with Parkhurst and his brother on Halloween night. The woman refused to do so and was never told why they wanted her alibi, but she assumed it was related to the accident, police said. Her information prompted investigators to go to Parkhurst’s home 35 miles north of Syracuse and question him again, said Fulton police Sgt. Stephen Lunn Jr. 'He invited us into his home,” Lunn said. 'At the time, he didn’t give any indication that he had any guilt to this, so to speak.' Over the course of several interviews, Parkhurst admitted he was drinking beer the night of the accident and was driving through Fulton with his brother passed out in the back seat when he hit something, Lunn said. Parkhurst told the investigators he believed at the time he had hit an animal, but now knows it was Carolee. He admitted that he initially lied when questioned about the accident in 1968, Lunn said. Carolee’s mother, Marlene, and the sister she was walking with, Darlene McCann, still live in the Fulton area. Attempts to reach them on Wednesday by phone and Facebook were unsuccessful. The car Parkhurst admitted driving that night, a tan 1962 Buick Special, was later junked in his sister’s backyard in the nearby town of Mexico, Lunn said. The rusted-out vehicle has been resting on its roof in a field for about 40 years and investigators were unable to glean any evidence from it that would tie it to the hit-and-run, he said. Lunn said various members of the police department in his city of 12,000 had worked at attempting to solve the case. 'It’s always the goal of the Fulton Police Department to attempt to bring whatever closure we could bring to the family,' he said.","Douglas Parkhurst, 62, of Oswego, New York has been identified as the driver of the car that failed to stop .

A 'wild sports junkie' has gone missing in the Swiss Alps while 'speed flying'. Daniel Hunt, 33, from Shepherd's Bush in west London, disappeared on Saturday while attempting to speed fly down the Lauterbrunnen mountain in the Swiss Alps. Speed flying combines skiing with paragliding, using a fabric wing to get down a steep mountain slope at speeds of up to 75mph. When Mr Hunt, who owns The Natural Food Store in Turnham Green, west London, failed to arrive at the agreed landing site at just after 10am rescue teams were alerted. The daredevil who  takes part in a range of extreme sports including slacklining - walking across chasms on a high wire - has completed a number of speed flights before but on this occasion while his friends landed safety, he vanished. Friends have launched an appeal for funds to pay for an ongoing search and rescue operation after his insurance company said they would not pay out any more. So far just over £3,000 has been donated and Kara De Los Reyes, who heads up the search team in the UK, said the support had been absolutely amazing. She added: 'We've had a really good response from a lot of people. 'It's hard to tell if we need more volunteers. We have six climbers and ten on the ground and some paragliders.' It is feared Mr Hunt could have fallen into a crevice or glacier in the Lauterbrunnen mountain area - a favourite of speed flyers - requiring helicopters and dog teams in the hunt.

She added: 'He rang me up about 9am and told me that after their flight, Dan didn't land behind him. 'They . took off one by one and in speed flying you can see the person behind. Tim searched the landing and take off area and there was no sign of . him.' Mr Hunt's friends have set up a Facebook and Twitter account to appeal for funds to help the search. According to the Evening Standard one of his best friends, Pedro Pimentel, 33, who has taken part in extreme sports with Mr Hunt, said: 'It's quite surprising that he has gone missing, he is experienced, I think he could still be alive.' Speed flying involves skiing down a mountain until a skier picks up enough speed to take-off on an attached 'wing' Pedro Pimentel, 33, who has taken part in extreme sports with Mr Hunt, said: 'It's quite surprising that he has gone missing, he is experienced, I think he could still be alive' Friend Laura Saunders, 26, a photographer, said: 'Daniel is such a lovely guy, everyone respects him and he is well known in the extreme sports community. 'You could not meet anyone kinder and everyone he meets likes him. He is very experienced in extreme sports so it’s very worrying and surprising that he is missing. 'We know that finding him quickly is vital because the longer a search takes the less chance there is of a good outcome.'

David Petraeus has consigned himself to a year in the doghouse with his wife even though he is getting ‘cabin fever’ stuck at home while he waits for the attention around his sex scandal to die down. Friends have revealed that the former head of the CIA has given up his relentless schedule of high level meetings for ‘self-imposed exile’ and grovelling to his family. Gone are his five-mile runs in the open air every morning in Washington D.C. - instead he has confined himself indoors and is working out on a treadmill. Scroll down for video . Frozen out: David Petraeus is reportedly spending his days begging for wife Holly's forgiveness (pictured right) after his affair came to light . Petraeus has also traded CIA briefings for emailing friends to chat and catching up on his reading. Meanwhile his wife of 38 years, Holly Petraeus, has made a point of going to work every day and leaving him home alone. Among the blog posts she has written in her role as a spokeswoman for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is the line: ‘You know the old saying: ‘If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.' According to the New York Times, friends of Petraeus are ‘concerned’ that a man so used to constantly working has nothing to do for the first time in his life. Affair: David Petraeus' affair with biographer came to light earlier this month leading to his resignation from the CIA . Furious: Mrs Petraeus marches ahead of her husband as his mistress and biographer Paula Broadwell (second left) gazes at him adoringly . His main focus is lying low and . salvaging his marriage given that Mrs Petraeus is said to be ‘furious’ over his conduct and has threatened to divorce him. Holly Petraeus posted a piece entitled 'Buyer beware – Potentially deceptive mortgage ads are targeting veterans and older Americans' in her role at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on November 19. It reads: 'Today, along with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), our Office of Enforcement sent letters to a number of lenders concerning potential violations of the Mortgage Acts and Practices – Advertising (MAP) Rule, a new rule that took effect in August 2011... 'Many of these potentially misleading practices seem to be directed at older Americans and servicemembers/veterans... 'You know the old saying: “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.” Some advertisers will use your military or veteran status as a way to approach you, promising special deals or implying VA approval... 'And although mortgage rates are very low right now, an offer promising “historically low rates” may still have hidden traps that turn it into a bad deal.' Petraeus’s close friend Jack Keane, the . former vice chief of staff of the Army, said: ‘Basically he’s the same . guy but considerably more subdued, in terms of his spirit. ‘And that’s understandable. His voice doesn’t have the same peppiness in it.’ Petraeus is said to be weighing up his options about what to do the in the future including offers for a book deal, speaking engagements and interest from various corporations to serve on their boards. Having hired media super-lawyer Robert Barnett he could also become a talking head on TV. For now, however, he hardly leaves the house and is having to prove to Mrs Petraeus that he deserves her trust again. The New York Times said he plans to put his life on hold for the next 12 months to sort out the mess. A friend said: ‘Several of us are concerned. He’s a very active individual. He needs to stay active.’ Another friend said: ‘I asked him whether he’d seen a certain article, and he said: ''No, send it my way. I’m looking for something to read right now.'' ‘He kept such a grueling schedule. This is unchartered territory for him right now.’ Meanwhile Mrs Petraeus has been in . the office every day at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in her . role running the Office of Service Member Affairs. She . has written two blog posts in the last week including one about the . dangers of buying a flood damaged car which includes the line: ‘Once . you’ve signed the contract you’re committed, so Know Before You Owe!’ Long relationship: David Petraeus and wife Holly, pictured last year, met on a blind date while he was at military academy . Until the scandal became public, the Petraeuses seemed to have a rock solid marriage. They met on a blind date when Petraeus was a student at the military academy at West Point, where Holly's father was the superintendent. He graduated in June 1947 and the couple married the following month, before going on to have two children, Ann and Stephen, and traveling the world with his work. Despite moving 24 times in 38 years, Holly has also built her own career. She became a volunteer, performing military and family support roles on bases, before assuming her current title. A source has told the National Enquirer that Petraeus has been ‘falling all over himself’ apologising but she ‘isn’t listening’. The source said: ‘After all his lies, she doesn't believe anything he says anymore, and she's thinking about consulting a divorce attorney.' Friends have also given fresh insight into how Petraeus became involved with Army reservist Paula Broadwell whilst she was writing his biography. A friend said that the general initially thought it was a book on Afghanistan and that he ‘belatedly’ realized it was about him.

Harold Mendenhall, 84, started giving blood on July 7, 1977, and has donated more than 400 times over the last 35 years. Last month, the 183lbs man from Riviera Beach, logged his 100th gallon, The Palm Beach Post reported. Still smiling: Despite being hooked up the the blood donor machines, Harold Mendenhall is happy to be contributing to the hospital's supplies after 35 years . Mendenhall started donating blood when his wife, Frankie, was diagnosed with breast cancer. When she died seven years later, Mendenhall says he was lost. He stopped by the blood bank in West Palm Beach on his way home from work. Soon he was donating six gallons a year. He gives platelets rather than whole blood, which means he can give two pints per donation instead of one and can give every two weeks instead of eight weeks. Mendenhall says giving blood helped him cope with the loss of his wife and, later, two sons. He told the Palm Beach Post: 'They always compliment me on my veins.' Milestone: Harold Mendenhall, 84, started giving blood on July 7, 1977, and is now celebrating his 100th gallon donated . Celebrations: Harold celebrated donating his 100th gallon over 35 years with hospital staff in Florida . Mendenhall gave his interview at the One Blood center in Lake Park, Florida, and joked to staff: 'Make sure you give me the sharp needle, not that square one.' Over the 36 years that he's been donating, Mendenhall's 100 gallons of blood is enough to have filled the gas tanks of eight Honda Civic cars. As well as losing his wife, the donor also lost two of his five children. His sons died from complicated disabilities at the ages of 47 and 53. 'For some reason, I'm still here and I'm grateful. That's one of the reasons I keep donating. 'Giving blood can only be done by a human being, so that's been my payback for my career and my good health and all the blessings I've had', he said. Before retiring, Mendenhall worked in research and development and helped develop spy planes' engines that were used during the Vietnam War and Cold War. He worked for Pratt & Whitney in Palm Beach County.","Harold Mendenhall started giving blood on July 7, 1977 .

"By . Meghan Keneally and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:44 EST, 1 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:22 EST, 2 May 2013 . When Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's college friend sent a text warning the Boston bomber that his fast was all over the news, 19-year-old Tsarnaev responded with 'lol' - universal text message-speak for a joke. Tsarnaev then told his pal Dias Kadyrbayev: 'You better not text me.' Kadyrbayev is one of three of Tsarnaev's college friends arrested on Wednesday by federal authorities and accused of trying to cover the suspected terrorist's tracks by throwing away his computer and a backpack full of firearms. Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, both Kazakh nationals, were charged with . conspiring to obstruct justice by destroying evidence. An American named Robel Phillipos is charged with knowingly and willfully making false statements to . investigators. Scroll down for videos . Arrested: Azamat Tazhayakov, one of the three charged with helping bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev cover his tracks, was taken into custody by police on April 19 (pictured) relating to immigration charges but formally arrested today . Questioning: Dias Kadyrbayev (pictured on April 19) reportedly told officers that he was the one to suggest taking the laptop from the bombing suspect's dorm room . Alarm bells: The friends said that they became concerned that Tsarnaev actually had something to do with the bombings when they found these empty firework containers in his dorm room . The three young men were friends of . Tsarneav at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, where the . 19-year-old bomb suspect was a promising student. According to the criminal complaint from federal authorities, Kadyrbayev sent a text message to Tsarnaev on April 18 after the FBI released surveillance images of him at the Boston Marathon with his brother Tamerlan. Kadyrbayev warned his friend that that he was plastered across TV News. 'Tsarnaev’s return texts contained ‘lol’ and other things KADYRBAYEV interpreted as jokes,' documents say. He also wrote: 'You better not text me’ and ‘Come to my room and take whatever you want' Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov had already . been in police custody for more than a . week at the time of their arrest because they were previously questioned about their license plate . that reads ‘TERRORISTA#1’. Authorities then held them on immigration . issues because they are in the country illegally after their academic . visas expired. The nature of these charges suggests that none of these young men helped plan the fatal Marathon bombing, which left three dead and more than 200 injured, but they did work to cover Tsarnaev’s tracks from investigators and evade capture. The detailed criminal complaint goes through the timeline of events according to each of the 19-year-olds, all of whom met Tsarnaev when they started school at UMASS-Dartmouth in the same semester in the fall of 2011. Like many throughout Boston, none of the three boys had any inkling that Tsarnaev was involved until the FBI released pictures of the two suspects, later identified as 19-year-old Dzhokhar and his 26-year-old brother Tamerlan. Friends in low places: Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov (left and center) were identified as the two friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) who have been held in Boston jail since April 20 . The American: Robel Phillipos, who was identified as this student by CNN, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with making false statements to police and obstructing justice in a terrorism investigation . On the same day that the FBI released pictures and video clips of the Tsarnaev brothers at the bomb scene, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov removed items from the younger bomber's dorm room. That was just two days before the FBI searched the room. The criminal complaint lists that they removed Dzhokhar's backpack from his room and 'agreed to get rid of it after concluding from news reports that Tsarnaev was one of the Boston Marathon bombers.' Prison: The maximum sentence for Robel Phillipos' charge of lying to federal officers, is eight years in jail as opposed to the other suspects who face five years . The three friends- Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov and Phillipos- went over to Tsarnaev's on-campus dormitory after seeing the news reports. When the group arrived at the dorm, . Kadyrbayev showed Tazhayakov a text from the bomber that said 'I'm about . to leave if you need something in my room take it.' He . did not specify where he was going, but Tazhayakov told investigators . that he felt that this meant he would never see Tsarnaev alive again. They were let in the room by Dzhokhar's roommate, who said that Dzhokhar had been there just a few hours earlier. The criminal complaint says that when there, the three friends watched a movie. Kadyrbayev 'knew when he saw the empty fireworks that Tsarnaev was involved in the Marathon bombing. Tazhayakov . was more alarmed because the tubes had been emptied but not destroyed, . meaning that Tsarnaev could have either used the explosives or planned . to use them. Kadyrbayev found Vaseline in the room, which he told the others Tsarnaev used to make bombs. Charged: Dias Kadyrbayev, left, and Azamat Tazhayakov, right, appeared in court together and waived their right to a bail hearing, meaning that they will remain in the jail until their next hearing on May 14 . At . one point in the police interviews, Tazhayakev said that during a meal a . month before the attack, Tsarnaev told he and Kadyrbayev that he knew . how to make a bomb. Kadyrbayev was reportedly the one who . 'decided to remove the backpack from the room in order to help his . friend Tsarnaev avoid trouble.' In . a slightly unexpected explanation, Kadyrbayev says that he took . Dzhokhar's laptop because he did not want to the roommate to think that . he was 'stealing or behaving suspiciously by just taking the backpack'. Though . the release of the photos is the first time that alarm bells went off . in the students’ minds, it is not the first time that they interacted . with the bomber since Monday April 15. Close: Azamat Tazhayakov, seen here with bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in an undated picture, told police that about a month before the Marathon attack, Dzhokhar said that he knew how to make a bomb . Texts: When the group arrived at the dorm, Dias Kadyrbayev (left) showed Tazhayakov (right) a text from the bomber that said 'I'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it' Happier times: Kadyrbayev told investigators that he suggested they take Tsarnaev's backpack and his laptop from the room, and later was the one to throw it in the garbage at his off-campus apartment . Both Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov- who shared an apartment in New Bedford- spent time with Tsarnaev two days after the bombing. Dzhokhar met with Kadyrbayev briefly, where Kadyrbayev noted that Dzhokhar 'appeared to have given himself a short haircut'. Tazahayakov . told police that he spent more time with Tsarnaev earlier that same . day, when Tsarnaev drove him to his off-campus apartment after class and . then they spent time hanging out in the apartment. Hunting for clues: The students reportedly disposed of materials for Dzhokhar at the garbage can at their house, which was transported to the Crapo Hill landfill, just nine miles from the UMass-Dartmouth campus . First suspects: Brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were identified as the first suspects . During . multiple interviews, Phillipos lied about various parts of the story- . at first saying that he never went to Tsarnaev's dorm room, then saying . that they didn't remove anything, then saying that they went to the dorm . but it was locked and they never entered. After repeating false versions of the same story, he recanted his previous testimony in the fourth interview on April 26. The . gravity of the situation did not appear to hit Phillipos until after . the trio returned to the off-campus apartment and they 'started to freak . out, because it became clear from a CNN report that we were watching . that Jahar was one of the Boston Marathon bombers.' The . Boston police were the first to announce the arrests via Twitter, and . they followed up their initial tweet by confirming that there is no . threat to public safety. Red flag: Police initially investigated the pair after the discovery of their license plates (pictured) but then held them on immigration charges since they are Kazakh nationals in the country on expired academic visas . The news of the arrests comes one day . after the elder suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s wife Katherine Russell was . interviewed by investigators after they spent hours searching her home. FBI official first linked the bombings to brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, releasing photos of the pair last Thursday, three days after the fatal blast killed three and injured more than 250 people at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. They were able to confirm the identity of the two after the photos were released, and later that evening Tamerlan died after an altercation with police where he opened fire on officers and his younger brother ended up driving over him in the getaway car. College friends: The first reports claim that the three people in custody all went to college with Dzhokhar at UMass Dartmouth and were thought to have helped him cover up for the bombings after the fact . Dzhokhar was arrested the following day after a city-wide manhunt lead to his discovery inside a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar was arrested and transported to an area hospital where he remains in police custody. He was charged with using a weapon of mass destruction, though the legal proceedings came into question after police initially interviewed him- and he allegedly confessed- before he was read his Miranda rights. After hearing his rights, he reportedly stopped talking to police.","Three taken into custody helped Dzhokhar Tsarnaev cover up for the bombing after the fatal blasts .

Kate Upton is reportedly 'furious' Victoria's Secret used photos of her in its newest catalog, just over a year after the casting director for the lingerie giant's catwalk shows said she 'would never use [her].' The busty 20-year-old was apparently shocked to discover old images of her posing in the brand's black Body bra have graced the pages of the lingerie brand's new catalog - without her permission. A source told The New York Post: 'The pictures are from 2011. Kate's not currently contracted to work with Victoria's Secret, and they didn't contact her before they used these images.' Surprise appearance: Kate Upton is 'furious' that her photo from 2011 was used in the new Victoria's Secret catalogue (pictured), without her knowledge. Just last year, the lingerie giant branded her look 'too obvious' Another source close to the model told WWD that the left a 'bad taste in her mouth'. The spokesperson added that Miss Upton is not necessarily 'furious,' over Victoria's Secret's decision, 'She’s just not thrilled about it, and the reason is she’s not contracted to work with Victoria’s Secret.' It indeed came as some surprise to see her posing for the brand, given that she was the subject of scathing comments from the Victoria's Secret model booker, Sophia Neophitou, in a New York Times interview early last year. Ms Neophitou told the paper that she would never book Miss Upton for the Victoria's Secret catwalk show. 'She is too obvious. She’s like a page three girl.' she said. 'She’s like a footballer’s wife, with the too-blond hair and the kind of face that anyone with enough money can go out and buy.' Ms Neophitou appears to be alone in her opinion of Miss Upton though. The model, who shot to fame after landing the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 2012, has become the darling of the fashion set. Career high: The model, 20 appeared on her second Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover this year . In just under 18 months, she has . appeared on three Vogue covers, fronted the inaugural issue of CR . Fashion Book, and posed in photo shoots for V Magazine, Terry Richardson . and Harper's Bazaar. She has also attended the Met Gala and modeled in campaigns for Sam Edelman and Mercedes Benz. And she still remains in favor with Sports Illustrated, who chose her for yet another Swimsuit Issue cover this year. But while Miss Upton has never been an official Angel, it would seem that she did have something of a relationship with Victoria's Secret in her teens. Buzzfeed reveals that she modeled . pajamas for the brand back in 2011, when she would have been about 18, . well before her Sports Illustrated fame. A certain look: Victoria's Secret's fashion show casting director says she 'would never use' Kate Upton . But the site's Amy O'Dell explains that a model's presence in the catalog does not automatically qualify her for the runway show. 'Casting for the catalog and fashion show are seen as two very different things to the fashion community,' she said. 'There’s a lot of cross-over but it's not a fully symbiotic relationship.' It remains unclear whether or not the image on the back of the new catalog is from the same 2011 photo shoot.","An image of the 20-year-old on the back of the lingerie giant's latest magazine circulated earlier this week .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:45 EST, 30 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:19 EST, 30 May 2013 . Two speedboats on their way to deliver huge shipments of drugs to the United States were stopped short by U.S. Customs patrols this past Memorial Day weekend, and their combined cargo came to an astounding 13,000 pounds of cocaine. That’s about $1 billion worth, if you’re keeping track. The first interception came on Friday when an airborne Jacksonville, Florida-based Customs and Border Protection crew spotted a speedboat north of the Galapagos Islands, west of the country of Ecuador, in the Pacific Ocean. Big bust: A helicopter sits alongside part of the 13,000 pounds of cocaine seized in two U.S. Customs and Border Protection interceptions over Memorial weekend . Crewmen on the 30-foot boat began to throw the goods overboard once they’d been spotted and officials and began ‘washing the boat to eliminate traces of cocaine,’ according to an official release. A customs helicopter was called to intercept the vessel and shots were fired, disabling the boat and its passengers, who were taken into custody. Around 7,000 pounds of cocaine were on the boat, worth about $500 million. Then, on Saturday, another boat was spotted, this time on the Caribbean side near the border of Panama and Columbia. Poorly hidden: One boat was intercepted near the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean on Friday and smugglers tried camouflaging themselves with a blue tarp . Huge burden: One shipment was found to be carrying 7,000 pounds of cocaine, while the other held 6,000 pounds . The driver attempted to hide the three-engine boat, weaving in and around shoals at the shore. To intercept, the Corpus Christie, Texas-based Customs and Border Protection officers contacted the Panamanian authorities, who apprehended the boat and its crew. The second boat was carrying 1,000 bundles of cocaine weighing around 6,000 pounds. Estimates put the worth of the May 25 haul at $445 million. Both sightings were made by crews flying so-called CBP P3 aircraft, a Lockheed manufactured long-range tracker plane. Expensive habit: The high speed boats carried a combined $1 billion worth of narcotics . ‘These disruptions are indicative of how successful a counter-narcotic asset the CBP P-3 program is,’ said Tom Salter, CBP Director of National Air Security Operations in Corpus Christi. ‘It’s the right asset to support the Joint Interagency Task Force – South in its efforts to disrupt the transport of illegal narcotics to the U.S.’ According to the release, the airborne fleet seized or disrupted more than 117,765 pounds of cocaine, valued at over $8.8 billion, in fiscal year 2012. The aircraft patrol a 42 million square mile area of the Western Caribbean and Easter Pacific in search of drugs in transit toward U.S. shores.

Of all household chores, loading and emptying the dishwasher is surely one of the most tedious.But when the items being unloaded are delicious home-made vodka infusions, the job becomes more exciting. I’m talking about ‘dishwasher vodka’ - a fast-growing internet craze for mixing sweets and chocolate with vodka, and running it through a dishwasher cycle. The heat is just enough to combine the contents without losing any alcohol or flavour. And while the idea of vodka mixed with pear drops or After Eight mints might sound unspeakably naff, enthusiasts insist the results can be astonishing. I decided to put it to the test . . . Loading up with flavour: Claudia prepares to wash her cocktail mix . Sweet sensation: Crush sweets and add them to the vodka or, if they'll fit, put them in whole . The good thing about dishwasher vodka is you don’t need fancy, branded spirits as the sweets provide most of the flavour. Cheap brands are fine. You’ll need a one-litre bottle for each flavour you intend to make. Decant one third and put aside. Add your ingredient of choice to the bottle - approximately 200g for hard, boiled or jelly sweets and 300g for chocolate. Screw the bottle tightly shut and wrap in cling film to protect from leakage. Shake the bottle and place on a shelf in your empty dishwasher. Do not add any detergent, set to the hottest wash (70 degrees in most models) and prepare to be amazed. When the cycle has finished, shake again, allow the infusion to cool and then, if necessary, strain away any residue through a tea strainer. Your vodka can then be chilled or frozen before serving. Here’s how I got on with the ten flavours I tried: . This melted perfectly into the vodka to create a dark orange liquid that did not need sieving. It smelled delicious.The flavour came through and the infusion was sweet and tasty. Tip: Use a blender on the Pear Drops to break them down in size, it doesn’t matter if they end up being just powder. As they are so sweet and sugary, you can get away with using just 150g. Too big to fit whole into the bottle and too soft to be blended, the Jelly Babies needed to be hand-chopped. Just as Shirley Conran decided life was too short to stuff a mushroom, I must conclude that it’s also too short to decapitate a Jelly Baby. Tip: The sweets didn’t melt well, leaving bits behind even after three sieves. I used red ones which gave a lovely soft, pink colour but the taste was weak and acidic. Not worth the hassle. Shake it: Mix the ingredients up before putting the bottle in the dishwasher . Soft and gooey, After Eights were easy to squish down into the bottle. They melted fairly well but did need to be sieved a couple of times. The chocolate mints blended to leave an unappealing brown, sludgy colour, but it smelled fresh and tasted sweet, rich and velvety. Beware, it’s very moreish. Tip: Serve over ice as a longer drink. These sweets were crushed to a sherbet powder after just a few seconds in the blender and melted brilliantly, leaving an acid yellow cocktail that would be great on a summer’s day. I used Pontefract cakes but any form of liquorice will work. This didn’t melt as well as some of the other ingredients, and needed to be sieved several times. It also blended to a very un-appetising dirty dishwater shade. The flavour was very intense and overpowering - impossible to drink more than one mouthful. Zingy: The Skittles vodka has a good kick . Lime treat: The flavour of your Jellies Babies will determine the cocktail shade . The good thing about Skittles is they’re small enough to pour straight into the neck of the bottle. I used a mix of all the flavours and the infusion melted to a dull, orange colour, a bit like tea. The final mixture ended up with a film of scum on top but this was easily drained away. The taste, however, more than makes up for it — sweet and zingy with a great kick. Tip: Use one flavour only for a vivid shade. Green and yellow work well. To create a striking colour I used just green gums and cut them into small pieces. The gums melted reasonably well but needed to be strained to remove some residue. The colour was amazing and the smell was strong, but the taste was a little underwhelming and syrupy. Unlike their chunkier Jelly Baby cousins, Gummy Bears fit easily down the neck of a vodka bottle. They melted well, leaving some jelly at the bottom of the bottle. If using a mixed pack the result is a very attractive tangerine shade. The vodka tasted sweet and mellow and smelled good too. Tip: Works best as a shot. Caramel heaven: The Werther's Original flavour is tasty . Cheers: Claudia said the result is worth the effort . These needed to be whizzed and broken down in a blender, but then they dissolved very well with no need to sieve afterwards. The resulting colour is a lovely ‘tequila sunrise’ shade which, when transferred to a glass, looks like a professional cocktail with a tangy and refreshing flavour. Tip: As with Pear Drops, these are sweet enough to get away with 150 grams. WERTHER'S ORIGINALS . Make sure you buy the original hard toffee. Break into smaller pieces in a blender or with the end of a rolling pin. The Werther’s Originals were the best dissolvers overall, and the smell when you unscrew the bottle is exquisite. The vodka is creamy, packed full of caramel flavour without being sickly sweet. Dishwasher vodka is quick and fun to make and, in most cases, the result is well worth the small effort. Harder, boiled sweets work the best all round in creating a drink that tastes and looks good. They all freeze well but are best drunk within a week, after which they start to lose colour and flavour. Cheers!","Mix sweets and chocolate with vodka then run though dishwasher cycle .

The president of Ohio State University said Notre Dame was never invited to join the Big Ten because the university's priests are not good partners, joking that 'those damn Catholics' can't be trusted, according to a recording of a meeting he attended late last year. Gordon Gee also took shots at schools in the Southeastern Conference and the University of Louisville, according to the recording of the December meeting of the school's Athletic Council that The Associated Press obtained under a public records request. The university called the statements inappropriate and said Gee is undergoing a 'remediation plan' because of the remarks. In trouble: Ohio State University president Gordon Gee was heard in a recording joking that the priests at Notre Dame University 'can't be trusted' and that's why they were never accepted into the Big 10 conference . Gee apologized in a statement released to the AP. 'The comments I made were just plain wrong, and in no way do they reflect what the university stands for,' he said. 'They were a poor attempt at humor and entirely inappropriate. There is no excuse for this and I am deeply sorry.' Gee, who has taken heat previously for uncouth remarks, told members of the council that he negotiated with Notre Dame officials during his first term at Ohio State, which began more than two decades ago. 'The fathers are holy on Sunday, and they're holy hell on the rest of the week,' Gee said to laughter at the December 5 meeting attended by Athletic Director Gene Smith and several other athletic department members, along with professors and students. 'You just can't trust those damn Catholics on a Thursday or a Friday, and so, literally, I can say that,' said Gee, a Mormon. The Big Ten had for years courted Notre Dame, but the school resisted as it sought to retain its independent status in college football. In September, the school announced that it would join the Atlantic Coast Conference in all sports except football. It also agreed to play five football games each year against ACC teams. All about football: Notre Dame (pictured) are rivals with Ohio State both because of skill and their proximity . In the recording, Gee referred specifically to dealing with the Reverend Ned Joyce, Notre Dame's longtime executive vice president, who died in 2004. 'Father Joyce was one of those people who ran the university for many, many years,' Gee said. Gee said the Atlantic Coast Conference added Notre Dame at a time when it was feeling vulnerable. 'Notre Dame wanted to have its cake and eat it, too,' Gee said, according to the recording and a copy of the meeting's minutes. Notre Dame spokesman Dennis Brown called the remarks regrettable, especially the reference to Joyce, 'who served Notre Dame and collegiate athletics so well and for so long.' Gee contacted Notre Dame's president, the Reverend John Jenkins, to offer an apology that was accepted, Brown said Thursday in an email. Ohio State trustees learned of . 'certain offensive statements' by Gee in January, met with the president . at length and created the remediation plan for Gee to 'address his . behavior,' board president Robert Schottenstein said in a statement. Comments . by a university leader about 'particular groups, classes of people or . individuals are wholly unacceptable,' Schottenstein said. 'These . statements were inappropriate, were not presidential in nature and do . not comport with the core values of the university.' Gee . has gotten in trouble before for offhand remarks, most recently during a . memorabilia-for-cash and tattoos scandal that cost football coach Jim . Tressel his job. Tressel had known about allegations that players were . trading game paraphernalia for money and tattoos but didn't tell the . university. Gee was asked in . March 2011 whether he had considered firing Tressel. He responded: 'No, . are you kidding? Let me just be very clear: I'm just hopeful the coach . doesn't dismiss me.' Tressel stepped down three months later. In . November 2010, Gee boasted that Ohio State's football schedule didn't . include teams on par with the 'Little Sisters of the Poor.' An . apologetic Gee later sent a personal check to the real Little Sisters of . the Poor in northwest Ohio and followed up with a visit to the nuns . months later. Irish spirit: The Notre Dame mascot is a fiery leprechaun who symbolizes 'the fighting Irish' Last year, Gee apologized for comparing the problem of coordinating the school's many divisions to the Polish army, an off-the-cuff remark that a Polish-American group called a 'slanderous' display of bigotry and ignorance. In 1992, in a moment of frustration over higher education funding, Gee told a student newspaper reporter, 'the governor's a damn dummy.' Then-Gov. George Voinovich laughed it off and the two became allies in the push for more education dollars. Gee has one of the highest-profile resumes of any college president in recent history. He has held the top job at West Virginia University, the University of Colorado, Brown University and Vanderbilt University. He was Ohio State president from 1990 to 1997, and returned in 2007. He earns about $1.9 million annually in base pay, deferred and performance compensation and retirement benefits. Offending the Church: In the recording, Gee took a swipe at the former Notre Dame Vice President Rev. Ned Joyce who died in 2004 (left). He has since contacted Notre Dame's president Reverend John Jenkins (right), to offer an apology that was accepted . He is a prolific fundraiser and is leading a $2.5 billion campaign at Ohio State. He is omnipresent on campus, attending everything from faculty awards events to dormitory pizza parties. He is known for his bow ties — he has hundreds — and his horn-rimmed glasses. During his comments to the Athletic Council, Gee also questioned the academic integrity of schools in the Southeastern Conference, and the University of Louisville. School pride: Of all teams, Notre Dame fans are among the most loyal and notorious football fanatics . The top goal of Big Ten presidents is to 'make certain that we have institutions of like-minded academic integrity,' Gee said. 'So you won't see us adding Louisville,' a member of the Big East conference that is also joining the ACC. After a pause followed by laughter from the audience, Gee added that the Big Ten wouldn't add the University of Kentucky, either. During the meeting, Gee also said he thought it was a mistake not to include Missouri and Kansas in earlier Big Ten expansion plans. Missouri has since joined the SEC. 'You tell the SEC when they can learn to read and write, then they can figure out what we're doing,' Gee said, when asked by a questioner how to respond to SEC fans who say the Big Ten can't count because it now has 14 members. Gee noted he was chairman of the SEC during his time as Vanderbilt University chancellor. He also told his audience that speculation about the SEC 'remains right here,' according to the recording. Gee took a swipe at Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany, one of the most powerful leaders in college athletics, when he answered a question about preserving Ohio State's financial interests in light of Big Ten revenue-sharing plans. 'No one admires Jim Delany more than I do — I chaired the committee that brought him here,' Gee said. 'Jim is very aggressive, and we need to make certain he keeps his hands out of our pockets while we support him.'","Ohio State University president was overheard at a conference taking a swipe at the rival school's religious heritage .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 17:02 EST, 30 May 2013 . An Iranian national from Texas who admitted that he plotted to kill Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the U.S. by bombing a Washington restaurant was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison. Manssor Arbabsiar, a U.S. citizen who was born in Iran, pleaded guilty in October to two conspiracy charges and a murder-for-hire count. He admitted he was directed by Iranian military officials to go to Mexico on multiple occasions in 2011 to arrange the assassination attempt, which never occurred. Scroll down for video . Punished: Manssor Arbabsiar (left) was handed a 25-year prison sentence for plotting to murder Saudi ambassador Adel Al-Jubeir (right) The 58-year-old Arbabsiar, who had . worked in real estate and automobile sales since moving to the United . States in 1977, approached someone he thought was a member of the . Mexican narco-terror group, Los Zetas, for help with an attack. The man turned out to be an informant for U.S. drug agents, who began recording their conversations. ‘What I did was wrong,’ Arbabsiar . said in court Thursday. ‘I take responsibility for it. ... My mind . sometimes is not in a good place.’ Prosecutors said Arbabsiar told the . confidential government source that killing innocent bystanders, . including U.S. senators who the source suggested would likely be at the . restaurant, was ‘no big deal.’ The government said Arbabsiar told . law enforcement officials after his arrest that he had demanded at least . $1million for his involvement in the plot. He was also given $25,000 by the Quds . Force, a branch of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that . in 2007 was designated by the U.S. Treasury Department as a supporter of . the Taliban and terrorist organizations. Defense lawyers argued for no more . than a 10-year sentence, saying Arbabsiar's crimes were undeniably . serious but also ‘the result of a severe mental breakdown caused by a . longstanding, untreated bipolar disorder, and that he had no previous . involvement in terrorism or international intrigue.’ Sentencing: In this courtroom sketch, Manssor Arbabsiar, center, stands with his attorneys in Manhattan Federal Court, where the judge sentenced the former used car salesman from Texas to 25 years in prison . In his own words: Arbabsiar read a statement before learning his fate, accepting responsibility for his actions and telling the court that sometimes his mind is 'not in a good place' In this drawing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Glen Kopp, standing, addresses the court, during the sentencing hearing for Arbabsiar, seated center, who admitted that he plotted to kill Saudi Arabia's ambassador . Arbabsiar entered a guilty plea last October, admitting that he plotted to assassinate the Saudi ambassador. He was described by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara at the time as 'the extended murderous hand of his co-conspirators, officials . of the Iranian military based in Iran, who plotted to kill the Saudi . Ambassador in the United States and were willing to kill as many . bystanders as necessary to do so.' Attorney General Eric Holder cited the efforts of law enforcement and . intelligence agencies in disrupting 'a deadly plot approved by members . of the Iranian military to assassinate a sitting foreign ambassador on . U.S. soil.' Arbabsiar entered the plea to two . conspiracy charges and a murder-for-hire count in U.S. District Court in . Manhattan. When the plot was uncovered last September, President Barack Obama's administration accused agents of the Iranian government of being involved. Bharara said Arbabsiar 'was in telephone contact with his Iranian confederates while he brokered an audacious plot.' Arbabsiar, pictured in this courtroom sketch in Manhattan Criminal Court, faces up to 25 years in prison . At the plea, Arbabsiar confirmed that officials in the Iranian military were involved in the plot . Arbabsiar admitted that he was directed . by Iranian military officials to go to Mexico on multiple occasions from . the spring to the fall last year to arrange the assassination. Arbabsiar, who lived in Corpus Christie, Texas, for more than a decade, said he went to Mexico last year to meet a man named Junior, 'who turned out to be an FBI agent.' He said that he and others had agreed to arrange the kidnapping of the ambassador, Adel Al-Jubeir, but Junior said it would be easier to kill the ambassador. Arbabsiar has been held without bail since he was arrested Sept. 29, 2011, at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The government said in a news release . that Arbabsiar had described to the Drug Enforcement Administration source how his cousin in Iran, a . 'big general' in the Iranian military, had requested that Arbabsiar . find someone to carry out the ambassador's assassination. It said Arbabsiar rejected as 'no big . deal' the DEA's worries about bystanders in a restaurant bombing, . including the possibility that U.S. senators who dine there could be . killed. Watched: The terror plot involved bombing the Saudi embassy in Washington D.C., seen here, after assassinating the ambassador . The Saudi Embassy is located next to the Watergate complex in Washington DC . Authorities have said they secretly recorded conversations between Arbabsiar and an informant with the Drug Enforcement Administration after Arbabsiar approached the informant in Mexico and asked his knowledge of explosives for a plot to blow up the Saudi embassy in Washington. They said Arbabsiar later offered $1.5million for the death of the ambassador. Arbabsiar admitted in October that he eventually made a $100,000 down payment wired from an overseas account through a Manhattan bank. After his arrest, Arbabsiar confessed . that he was recruited, funded and directed by men he believed were . senior officials in Iran's Qods Force, a branch of the Iranian Islamic . Revolutionary Guard Corps that in 2007 was designated by the U.S. Treasury Department as a supporter of the Taliban and terrorist . organizations, the government said. Suspect: Alleged terror plotter Manssor Arbabsiar's home in Round Rock, Texas . Arbabsiar told the court that he only understood about half of what he read out in court in English . It said he claimed that he met several . times in Iran with Gholam Shakuri, a co-conspirator and Iran-based . member of the Qods Force, and another senior Qods Force official. After . his arrest, Arbabsiar made phone calls at the direction of law . enforcement to Shakuri in Iran and Shakuri confirmed that Arbabsiar . should move forward with the ambassador plot, the government said. Iran formally complained to the U.S. in October 2011 over the claims that the Iranian government was involved in the plot to kill Adel Al-Jubeir. The U.S. received a diplomatic note expressing displeasure with the charges. The complaint called on the U.S. to apologize publicly to Iran for the 'material and moral damages' caused by 'this baseless accusation.' It added that the accusations violated . 'international rules and regulations' but that deception has become 'a . permanent part of statecraft in the U.S.' The note was delivered through the . Swiss embassy in Tehran, which represents U.S. interests in Iran since . the two countries don't have diplomatic relations.","Manssor Arbabsiar, 58, was arrested when he tried to hire a Mexican drug dealer to carry out the attack at a Washington restaurant .

Hedonistic life: Turney Duff, pictured, an ex-hedge fund trader, has described Wall Street's hedonistic culture of booze, drugs and prostitutes in the early noughties, in an explosive new book . An ex-hedge fund trader has described Wall Street's hedonistic culture of booze, drugs and prostitutes in the early noughties, in an explosive new book. Turney Duff, who cut his teeth at The Galleon Group before its founder, Raj Rajaratnam, was put away for insider trading, recounts days spent trading millions of dollars of other people's money with his 'head throbbing, tequila oozing from his pores and his crumpled Prada suit reeking of cigarettes' after another wild night of excess. 'As the opening bell rings, every muscle in my body clenches,' he writes in his tell all memoir 'The Buy Side: A Wall Street Trader's Tale of Spectacular Excess' of one of the many days-after-the-night-before in summer 2002, at Argus Partners. The book is being exclusively previewed by The New York Post. 'I sit upright and try to focus on the eight computer screens in front of me. There are 25 orders on my desk, each from five to 10 million dollars and involving some sort of investment decision. My head throbs.' He makes it, miraculously, to the closing bell. Forty-five minutes later, he's back at the East Side Manhattan apartment he and his pals nickname 'The White House' because it is never in short supply of cocaine. Right now, he explains, there's an ounce of it piled in the microwave and another few thousand dollars' worth sitting on a plate in the kitchen. The 'Wall Street crack house' that's home to his friends Randy and James, two sell side traders, is similarly scattered with Grey Goose vodka, ice, cups and straws for snorting the drug. W Hotel: Duff describes picking up at the Wetbar, right, at the W Hotel in Manhattan . Trader: Duff's bad behavior occurred in the summer of 2002 while he was working for Argus Partners, pictured, on Wall Street . 'Everything is provided and paid for, . compliments of the sell side ... They like to please their clients,' he . writes in the excerpt in The Post. Then the door bell rings. 'Tonight they were kind enough to order in: Chinese and Mexican escorts.' He describes how he watched as two American Express black cards fly through the air, landing right on top of the 'blow' and James proceeds to use them to chop the cocaine as a dozen men roll up their shirtsleeves, ready to get stuck in. Meanwhile, Duff writes, 'a large-breasted firecracker' named Adelina drags a suggestive finger across his chest. By 8 p.m., most of the guys have packed up and gone back to their wives, girlfriends and children, the book reads, according to The Post. The single lads head out - but not before they each dump a spoonful of blow in a doggy bag. The W Hotel's Wetbar was a regular . hang out, and he describes picking up college girls at the 'dark and . sexy' establishment, answering, smugly, when they ask his profession: 'I . work on Wall Street,' as he pours them champagne. Memoir: In his tell all book, 'The Buy Side: A Wall Street Trader's Tale of Spectacular Excess,' pictured, Duff writes of one of the many days-after-the-night-before in summer 2002 while he was at Argus Partners . Everyone was doing it: Duff, pictured left and right in 2013, explains that many of his colleagues were partaking in drugs and hookers despite having wives and girlfriends at home . He allows these girls to leave after delivering hours of arrogant narrative, but Duff describes how 'if (he) liked them less' he would have tricked them into going home with him. 'I still live on 67th and Broadway,' he writes in the pages published by The Post. 'Sometimes I ask girls if they want to go to an underground . club called Club 67. When the taxi pulls up to my building, they start . to get suspicious. 'But my . doorman is in on the ruse, and when I ask him if the club is open he'll . say: ""Yes, go on up.""' Tonight, however, he opts for Barbara, a hooker in her forties he likes to frequent near Lexington Avenue. Wearing . a black-lace nighty, the escort, who has 'a bird's nest of wrinkles' on . either side of her eyes,  unchains the lock and lets him in. 'Her . apartment is lined with Christmas lights year round, and there's a . mattress with no box spring in the far corner just outside of her . bathroom,' he explains. The couch, television and coffee table remind . him of the ones he shared with seven roommates in college. Insider trading: Duff cut his teeth at the Galleon Group before its founder Raj Rajaratnam, pictured center, was done for insider trading . 'I'm tired and feel dirty,' Duff writes. 'Barbara asks if I’d like to take a shower with her. The hot water pelts my body. We take turns washing each other, and laugh as we do. Best 20 minutes I've had all day.' In the book, which hits shelves on June 4, Duff thanks a rehabilitation center as well as Sarah Blakely, founder of successful underwear company Spanx, and her husband Jesse Jaymes, suggesting he is now sober after his years of excess but still has friends in high places. In excerpts of the book on Amazon, Duff describes another evening of debauchery - this time his 34th birthday party in October 2003. He writes that he and his 'inner circle' all fashionably dressed swan into the Canal Room in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood, as he arrogantly tells the smiling owner, Marcus: 'They're with me.' 'Marcus is smiling for good reason. He calls me the Pied Piper - King of the Night. And soon my following, the royalty of young Wall Street, will fill his club,' Duff explains. 'One friend, Brian, gives me 10 ecstasy pills. I have no intention of taking them - well,maybe just one or two. I shove them into my pocket to use as party favors later,' he writes. By 9:30 p.m. the night spot is throbbing and people are dancing to the music with drinks held high. 'It seems all of Wall Street is here, at least all of Wall Street that matters,' he recounts. 'They're a tribe doing a triumphant war dance. I know this room will earn hundreds of millions of dollars combined in annual income this coming year - what the Street likes to call 'f***-you money.'","Turney Duff cut his teeth at The Galleon Group before its founder, Raj Rajaratnam, was put away for insider trading .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:00 EST, 28 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:36 EST, 29 May 2013 . President Barack Obama is preparing to nominate former Bush administration official James Comey to head the FBI, people familiar with the decision said Wednesday. Three people with knowledge of the selection said Obama planned to nominate Comey, who was the No. 2 in President George W. Bush's Justice Department. The three people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the selection ahead of Obama's announcement, which was not expected immediately. Comey became a hero to Democratic opponents of Bush's warrantless wiretapping program when Comey refused for a time to reauthorize it. Bush revised the surveillance program when confronted with the threat of resignation by Comey and current FBI Director Robert Mueller, who is stepping down in September. New FBI director? President Barack Obama is reportedly preparing to nominate former Bush administration official James Comey to head the FBI . Comey's selection was first reported by NPR and was not expected to be announced for several days at least. Senate confirmation will be needed. The change in leadership comes as the FBI and Justice Department are under scrutiny for their handing of several investigations. Obama has ordered a review of FBI investigations into leaks to reporters, including the secret gathering of Associated Press phone records and emails of a Fox News reporter. And there have been questions raised about whether the FBI properly responded to warnings from Russian authorities about a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. The agency, meanwhile, is conducting a highly-anticipated investigation into the Internal Revenue Service over its handling of conservative groups seeking tax exempt status. Comey was deputy attorney general in 2005 when he unsuccessfully tried to limit tough interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists. He told then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales that some of the practices were wrong and would damage the department's reputation. Some Democrats denounced those methods as torture, particularly the use of waterboarding, which produces the same sensation as drowning. Earlier in his career, Comey served as . U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, one of the nation's . most prominent prosecutorial offices and one at the front lines of . terrorism, corporate malfeasance, organized crime and the war on drugs. Replacement: Comey would replace FBI Director Robert Mueller, pictured, who is stepping down in September . As an assistant U.S. attorney in Virginia, Comey handled the investigation of the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, that killed 19 U.S. military personnel. Comey led the Justice Department's corporate fraud task force and spurred the creation of violent crime impact teams in 20 cities, focusing on crimes committed with guns. Comey was at the center of one of the Bush administration's great controversies — an episode that focused attention on the administration's controversial tactics in the war on terror. In stunning testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007, Comey said he thought Bush's no-warrant wiretapping program was so questionable that Comey refused for a time to reauthorize it, leading to a standoff with White House officials at the bedside of ailing Attorney General John Ashcroft. Comey said he refused to recertify the program because Ashcroft had reservations about its legality. Senior . government officials had expressed concerns about whether the National . Security Agency, which administered the warrantless eavesdropping . program, had the proper oversight in place. Other concerns included . whether any president possessed the legal and constitutional authority . to authorize the program as it was carried out at the time. New appointment: News of the possible appointment comes as President Barack Obama is traveling in Chicago for two fundraisers . The White House, Comey said, recertified the program without the Justice Department's signoff, allowing it to operate for about three weeks without concurrence on whether it was legal. Comey, Ashcroft, Mueller and other Justice Department officials at one point considered resigning, Comey said. 'I couldn't stay if the administration was going to engage in conduct that the Department of Justice had said had no legal basis,' Comey told the Senate panel. A day after the March 10, 2004, incident at Ashcroft's hospital bedside, Bush ordered changes to the program to accommodate the department's concerns. Ashcroft signed the presidential order to recertify the program about three weeks later. The dramatic hospital confrontation involved Comey, who was the acting attorney general during Ashcroft's absence, and a White House team that included Bush's then-counsel, Alberto Gonzales, and White House chief of staff Andy Card, Comey said. Gonzales later succeeded Ashcroft as attorney general. Comey testified that when he refused to certify the program, Gonzales and Card headed to Ashcroft's sick bed in the intensive care unit at George Washington University Hospital. When Gonzales appealed to Ashcroft, the ailing attorney general lifted his head off the pillow and in straightforward terms described his views of the program, Comey said. Then he pointed out that Comey, not Ashcroft, held the powers of the attorney general at that moment. Gonzales and Card then left the hospital room, Comey said. 'I was angry,' Comey told the panel. 'I thought I had just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man who did not have the powers of the attorney general.'","Obama is reportedly planning to nominate James Comey, who was second-in-command at the Justice Department during the Bush administration .

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 02:27 EST, 1 February 2012 . It was a music hall favourite which has since become instantly synonymous with wartime Britain. But while the popularity of 'It's A Long Way To Tipperary' has never been in doubt, two towns are fighting over the exact origin of the First World War classic. A row has erupted between Oldbury, in the West Midlands, and Manchester suburb Stalybridge after both claimed the iconic tune was written on their patch. Iconic: It's A Long Way To Tipperary is well-known and loved as a wartime classic . Both places are planning civic events to mark the 100th anniversary of the inspiring song, but they cannot agree on where its author penned the famous tune. Jack Judge, the song's writer, was a fishmonger who hailed from Oldbury, but it is accepted that he first performed it on Jan 31 1912 at Stalybridge's Grand Theatre. A brass band will belt out the classic in Stalybridge centre, while Oldbury Library will be the venue for a community choir’s rendition of the song. Writer Jack Judge hailed from Oldbury, West Mids, but first performed the song in Stalybridge, Manchester . Historians in Stalybridge are adamant he penned his classic during an extended stint at the theatre, after a fellow artiste wagered five shillings he couldn’t write a winning tune in less than a day. Alan Rose of Stalybridge Local History Society, said in the 1920s, Jack Judge wrote a letter to the Stalybridge Year Book confirming he wrote it while staying at the town’s Newmarket Tavern. A plaque to that effect has since been placed on the pub wall. Yet their Oldbury counterparts insist Jack, born in 1872, wrote the tune - originally entitled It’s A Long Way To Connermara - at home, before taking it on the road when his music hall career took off. Mr Rose said: 'Oldbury is claiming it because he was a resident there, but there is no doubt he wrote it in Stalybridge. There is no doubt in my mind. 'He got himself into a bet with another artiste. He bet five shillings Jack couldn’t write a song in 24 hours, which he did.' That’s news to Oldbury residents who believe Jack crafted his greatest hit on the piano of a local pub. Immortalised: In Tameside, Manchester, there is a statue of Jack Judge (left) alongside a WW1 soldier, while in Oldbury, a library has been named after the music hall songwriter . Dr Terry Daniels, head of Oldbury Local History Society, believes Jack ‘pulled a fast one’. He already had the tune in his pocket when he agreed the bet. 'He was always a betting man and he would steer a conversation to writing songs,' he said. 'There is no doubt he sang It’s A Long Way To Tipperary for the first time in Stalybridge - no one in Olbury disagrees with that. But it was not produced from a blank piece of paper.'","Oldbury, West Midlands and Stalybridge, Manchester both claim song was written on their patch .

A police officer repeatedly punched his pregnant ex-girlfriend in the stomach because he did not want her to have his baby. Matthew Cherry, 35, is alleged to have barged his way into police officer Caroline Craft’s flat in Bournemouth, wearing a balaclava and hooded top, to carry out the attack and try to force a miscarriage. Cherry, a Dorset Police officer at the time, was angry, aggressive and desperate for Miss Craft to have an abortion, a court has heard. Police officer Matthew Cherry, pictured on his phone at court yesterday, allegedly attacked his pregnant ex-girlfriend in the hope she would suffer a miscarriage . He is also alleged to have told her that he had thought about punching her in the stomach so she would lose her baby. The pair split up after she decided not to have a termination. Miss Craft was six months’ pregnant when she was attacked, Winchester Crown Court heard. Cherry, . from Parkstone in Poole, Dorset, denies attempting to cause grievous . bodily harm with intent and said he was not the attacker. Matthew . Jewell, prosecuting, said Miss Craft, 27, also a Dorset Police officer, . was in her ground-floor flat at around 10am on March 24 last year . waiting for an estate agent to call because she was selling up. In the meantime, the barrister said, a man the prosecution claim was Cherry got into the block by buzzing an intercom of another flat and saying 'police'. Cherry then pretended to be a cleaner using a vacuum cleaner, in what was a planned attack by someone 'forensically aware', Mr Jewell said. 'Caroline Craft then heard a knock on the door of her flat. 'She opened the door which was then pushed violently from outside and she was either pushed or punched to the floor,' Mr Jewell said. 'She was then attacked with multiple punches to her stomach and back, in a way which targeted her unborn child. 'She shouted for help and a gloved hand was placed over her mouth. She was also kicked. 'She pointed out valuable items in case this was a robbery or burglary but her attacker showed no interest in taking anything. 'She was dragged into the bathroom and forced to sit on the toilet. The male said he would tie her up. Winchester Crown Court (pictured) where the jury heard Cherry attacked punched his former girlfriend in the stomach and back, in a way which targeted her unborn child . 'She was absolutely terrified about what was happening to her in her own home.' But then the doorbell rang before the attacker could go any further, as estate agent Paul Penny turned up. The attacker fled, the jury was told, using a back door - because he knew the layout of the building. 'He (Mr Penny) saw Caroline bloodied and bruised. She was taken to hospital and although she had extensive bruising and some scratches, she was not seriously harmed. 'Equally fortunately, her unborn baby was unharmed. 'It is quite clear however, that her attacker had begun an assault upon her which he intended to cause her really serious harm, and the only reason that he did not do so was the arrival of Mr Penny.' Mr Jewell told the jury: 'He had a motive for doing so and who . else would have the motive for carrying out the attack in this . particular way, targeting the unborn child?' Mr Jewell told the court that Cherry previously owned the flat and had sold it to Miss Craft. They met in May 2010 and their relationship was not happy, with Cherry even denying he was seeing Miss Craft. The couple moved in together with another woman, Carla Hutchings, renting a spare room. Miss Craft found out she was pregnant in October 2010. 'The defendant did not take the news well,' Mr Jewell told the jury. Later, after a party, Cherry told Miss Craft 'she had ruined his life and told her to get out'. The barrister said: 'She sat in the lounge crying. After a short time, he too began to cry and apologised.' During the following weeks Cherry made it clear he did not want the child and said he wanted Miss Craft to have an abortion. He also said he was not the father. In October 2010 the couple visited a doctor and it was clear that Miss Craft wanted the baby but Cherry did not, the jury heard. 'He was vocal and forceful during the consultation. She was subservient and tearful,' Mr Jewell said. 'The doctor was so concerned by his behaviour that she left the consultation to speak to a colleague about it.' The next month Miss Craft told the doctor that she wanted a termination but she was not happy about it. Cherry was present but said little. She later did not go through with it and Cherry was aggressive about the decision. The couple then split. The barrister said that Cherry spoke to a colleague while on police patrol about how he could bring about a miscarriage but by December he seemed to have changed his mind and said that he would fight for custody, the jury was told. When arrested Cherry said he had not attacked Miss Craft and that he was at a house he was renovating in nearby Poole when it happened.Miss Craft gave birth to a boy last year.

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 10:16 EST, 23 March 2012 . A man has today been found guilty of murdering a mother-of-nine who was hacked to death before being dumped in a wheelie bin. Shauna Lee, 36, was pregnant with twins when she was killed by Karl Burman and her remains have never been found. It is believed she was incinerated. Burman, 24, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 19 years for killing his partner Shauna Lee. Killer: Karl Burman, 24, right, chopped up pregnant Shauna Lee's, left, body before dumping her remains in a wheelie bin . Prosecutor Mark Wall QC told Birmingham . Crown Court during the trial that the defendant had chopped up the mother's . body, put the parts in bin bags and chucked them away with the rubbish. As the waste is not routinely inspected, it is likely the human remains would have been taken away by council binmen unaware of what was inside. Police investigating her disappearance . had little success until Burman dialled 999 some six months after she disappeared in November 2010 and said he had killed her. Prosecutor Mr Wall said: 'He said he hit her over the head with a hammer. 'He said he then chopped her up using “garden loppers”. He claimed it took him a day or two to chop her up. 'He said after he had chopped her up he put her in bin bags and chucked her away. All in all he said it took about seven days.' Shauna Lee's body has never been found, but her Coventry flat (pictured) was left with blood on the walls and floorboards . Dumped: Burman chopped up her body before putting it into a wheelie bin. It is thought it was incinerated . In interviews Burman claimed that Miss Lee had asked him to help her commit suicide. During the trial, forensic expert . witnesses said that Shauna’s blood had been found all over her flat in . Lower Coundon, Coventry. Attempts had been made to clean the stains off the carpet, walls and radiator, but traces were discovered. In one confession, Burman told an . adult supervisor he had used garden loppers to chop up Miss Lee’s body . before putting it into black bags which he then disposed of in a wheelie . bin. A pathologist estimated that it would . take around an hour to dismember a corpse although, in another . confession, Burman had claimed it took him one or two days. Tragic Miss Lee, who had all of her children put in care, had told friends she was pregnant just before she disappeared. Just . a few days before her . disappearance Miss Lee had told police that when she had told her . partner she was expecting twins he had taken her to hospital urging her . to have an . abortion. When they returned . home without being seen by doctors he was said to have repeatedly . punched her in the stomach and on the back of the head in a 30 minute . attack. Miss Lee told police . about the assault on October 30 but police only spoke to Burman on . December 5 - by which time he had already killed her. Today . Burman, from Foleshill, Coventry, showed no reaction as the jury found . him guilty of murder in just two hours and two minutes after a . three-week trial. Judge Kate Thirlwall told him: 'Shauna had nine children, all of them in care, but we know from other members of her family that they are responsible for two of her children. Burman used a pair of garden loppers, like these pictured, to hack up Miss Lee's body . 'She loved her children and told them so every time they met. 'The children have lost their mother’s love and, in due course, they will have to come to terms with the manner of her death. 'You struck her repeatedly on the head with a hammer. She was much smaller than you - you can only have intended to kill her. 'Having done that you set about disposing of her body. You did so with chilling efficiency. 'No part of her body has ever been found, there has never been a funeral or memorial service.' Speaking after the sentencing, Shauna’s brother Chris said that she would 'never be forgotten'. He said: 'Shauna is always in our hearts, reminding us she is with us wherever we go. 'She will always be remembered and never forgotten, we will love her always. 'Our hearts are torn in two not being . able to grieve for Shauna, as we all miss her so terribly. Till this . day I don’t know why this happened, but me, Sam and the kids will always . miss you.'","Karl Burman flew into a rage after Shauna Lee, 36, told him she was expecting twins .

A worldwide moratorium on trading in ivory has been in place since 1989 but since 1997 there have been sustained attempts by certain countries to overturn the ban, according to campaign group Bloody Ivory.

A bloody trade: Across Africa, elephant poaching is now at its highest level for more than 20 years, which campaigners say is due to increased demand for ivory from newly affluent Chinese consumers . Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe were in 1999 allowed an 'experimental one-off sale' of over 49,000kg of ivory to Japan. A further one off-sale was approved in 2002 and finally took place in 2008, resulting in 105,000kg of ivory being shipped to China and Japan. In 2009, over 20,000kg of ivory was seized by police and customs authorities worldwide and in 2011, just thirteen of the largest seizures amounted to over 23,000kg, breaking all records since the ivory ban.

'The 1989 ban helped elephants to recover in most parts of Africa. Now even in Amboseli we're losing elephants to ivory poachers for the first time in many years.

President Barack Obama's re-election campaign plans to release a 17-minute documentary next week about his first term in office. The Road We've Traveled will be released on March 15, but until then, the campaign has unveiled a snippet of the film as a trailer on YouTube. The film is narrated by actor and director Tom Hanks. Scroll down for the trailer . Chronicle: The Road We've Traveled, which chronicles the four years of Obama's presidency, will be released on March 15 . The trailer opens with the Saving Private Ryan star asking: 'How do we understand this president and his time in office? 'Do we look at the day’s headlines, or do we remember what we as a country have been through?' This appears to be an attempt to redefine Mr Obama as a historic President faced with unique challenges, rather than taking a short-term view of the ailing economy and high unemployment. The film will chronicle major struggles of Mr Obama's four years in office, including the economic crisis, ObamaCare, the auto industry bailout and the mission that took . out Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Despair: Republicans have criticised the video, which they say whitewashes the President's record . Featured in the film, according to . the trailer, are Vice President Joe Biden, former advisers David Axelrod . and Austan Goolsbee and former Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said the documentary was directed by Davis Guggenheim, whose credits include the Oscar-winner An Inconvenient Truth, about Al Gore's global-warming campaign. Messina says the documentary will, in his words, 'put into perspective the enormous challenges that the nation faced when the president took office and the strides we've made together.' Campaigns frequently release documentary films to reach voters and amplify the narrative of a candidate's message. Campaigning: The video will be shown at election events over the next few months . However, few election films have the pedigree of this one, which is directed by one Oscar-winner and narrated by another. It will be shown at Obama campaign stops across the country, but not everyone's impressed - Republicans have been speaking out against the footage. GOP spokesperson Kirsten Kukowski told USA Today: 'Americans don't need a movie to learn about the president's record. She added: 'Unfortunately Americans feel Obama's accomplishments each and every day after President Obama led our country to higher unemployment, record debt, and higher gas prices'. Tense: One of the events chronicled in The Road We've Traveled is Obama's decision to OK the mission that took out Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden . Milestones: The film is directed by Davis Guggenheim and will feature Obama's achievements while in office, including health care reform . A spokesman for the Republican National Committee was also sceptical of Mr Obama's latest campaign gambit. 'In 2008, he did a 30-minute infomercial to talk about what he would do as president, and it seems somewhat ironic that four years later he has to stretch a 17-minute video to say what he's done,' the spokesman said. 'As well done as it is, even the best Hollywood studio effects can't cover up the failed policies of the last three years.' The film is reminiscent of The Man From Hope, a film about Bill Clinton made by TV producers Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason at the time of the 1992 election.

Wali-ur-Rehman, deputy commander of the Tehreek-e-Taliban was one of seven people killed in the attack in the North Waziristan region on Wednesday. Wali-ur-Rehman was poised to take over the leadership of the Pakistani Taliban, which is a separate entity and ally to the Taliban in Afghanistan, and his death is a major blow in the fight against the militants in the area. Dead: Wali-ur-Rehman, deputy commander of the Tehreek-e-Taliban, was allegedly one of seven people killed in a US drone attack in the North Waziristan region . The drone attack is the first since the country’s general election on May 11 where the U.S.’s use of the unmanned aircrafts was one of the most debated issues. One Pakistani security official said the death of the senior Taliban was a ‘huge blow to militants and a win in the fight against insurgents’. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have launched devastating attacks against the Pakistani military and civilians in the Pashtun areas along the Afghan border. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan spokesman Ihsanullah Ihsan said the group did not have ‘confirmed reports’ that Wali-ur-Rehman had been killed and declined to comment any further. Senior Taliban: Wali-ur-Rehman, pictured flanked by two masked members of the Tehreek-e-Taliban, was said to have been poised to take over leadership of the militants . Drone casualties are difficult to verify as Taliban fighters also often seal off the sites of drone strikes immediately so the victims cannot be identified. ‘That the Taliban are remaining silent and neither denying or confirming the news is itself peculiar,’ said Saleem Safi, a Pakistani expert on the Taliban. ‘But if this news is true, then the Pakistan army has the U.S. to thank.’ The security officials and Pashtun tribesmen in the northwestern region said the drone fired two missiles that struck a mud-built house at Chashma village, two miles east of Miranshah, the region's administrative town. They said seven people were killed and four wounded. ‘Tribesmen started rescue work an hour . after the attack and recovered seven bodies,’ said resident Bashir . Dawar. ‘The bodies were badly damaged and beyond recognition.’ The . Pakistan government had yet to confirm Wali-ur-Rehman's death and its . foreign ministry denounced drones following the Wednesday attack. Hot debate: The US military's use of drones in Pakistan has been widely criticized as the strikes have many civilian victims . ‘The government has consistently maintained that the drone strikes are counter-productive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives, have human rights and humanitarian implications and violate the principles of national sovereignty, territorial integrity and international law.’ U.S. President Barack Obama recently indicated he was scaling back the drone strike programme, winning cautious approval from Pakistan, a key ally in the U.S. fight on militancy. North Waziristan is on the Afghan border and has long been a stronghold of militants including Afghan Taliban and their Al-Qaeda and TTP allies. Prime Minister-elect Nawaz Sharif said this month that drone strikes were a ‘challenge’ to Pakistan's sovereignty. ‘We will sit with our American friends and talk to them about this issue,’ he said.","Deputy commander of Tehreek-e-Taliban killed by US drone attack .

A chemical usually associated with how happy we feel could also play a pivotal role in our sexual preferences, researchers have discovered. A Chinese team found that blocking serotonin, known as the brain's 'happy chemical' caused female mice to switch their sexual preferences. It is the first time that sexual preference has been reversed in animals without sex hormones. Researchers found that when they blocked the serotonin receptors in female mice, their sexual preferences switched and they tried to mount other females . Serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine, is a  neurotransmitter - a chemical substance that transmits nerve impulses across the space between nerve cells or neurons. It plays an important part in the regulation of learning, mood, sleep and helps control blood vessels. It has also been linked to anxiety, migraine, vomiting and appetite. Yi Rao of Peking University in . Beijing, China, and his colleagues genetically engineered female mice so . that they could no longer make or respond to serotonin. 'Female mouse mutants lacking either . central serotonergic neurons or serotonin prefer female over male . genital odors when given a choice, and displayed increased female–female . mounting when presented either with a choice of a male and a female . target or only with a female target,' the team wrote in their paper, . which is published in the journal PNAS. Although the research was carried out in mice, serotonin works in the same way in human brains . 'Our results indicate that serotonin controls sexual preference,' they say. 'It's possible that the well-known . effect of early sex hormone levels on partner preference and the . serotonin mechanism described here are completely independent . mechanisms,' Simon LeVay of Stanford University told New Scientist. 'In other words, serotonin systems . may be part of the cascade of signals that translate sex hormone levels . during development into sexual partner preference in adulthood.'","Chinese researchers found blocking serotonin in female mice caused them to prefer sniffing and mounting females .

The ban was imposed on life-long anti-abortion campaigner Atkinson, who lives in Hilgay, near Downham Market, in 2006. The hospital had previously been flooded with thousands of angry letters containing similarly explicit material from Atkinson's supporters in the U.S. after he last went on the warpath over abortion. Atkinson admitted breaching the order at court on Monday and was given a three-month jail term, suspended for 18 months. The ASBO was extended until March 2017 and he was given a three-month curfew. Judge Nicholas Coleman accepted Atkinson had been a life-long activist against abortion but said he had to comply with the order however much he disagreed with it. He warned the pensioner that if he breached it he would be jailed. 'If you commit an offence in the future this sentence will take effect,' Judge Coleman said. Julianna Tolan, defending, said Atkinson now realised there were other ways of putting his views across. 'There are legal ways he can protest which would ensure he would not come before the courts again,' she said. She said the pensioner had wanted to make contact with the new chief executive as he was also aggrieved that his ban meant he could not get his hip replacement carried out at Queen Elizabeth Hospital but had to go elsewhere. Target: The pensioner sent a package of extreme anti-abortion material to King's Lynn Queen Elizabeth Hospital . Miss Tolan said the package Atkinson sent to the hospital had carried a warning stating that it was not to be opened by anyone who might be offended by the material. 'It was not his intention to cause alarm,' she said. 'The envelope was clearly marked.' 'No one deserves to be on the receiving end of hate mail' Hospital spokesman . After the case Atkinson said that the sentence would not stop him battling to outlaw abortions. 'I am not going to stop until the scourge of abortion has been lifted from our law,' he said. Atkinson was supported in court by Victoria Gillick, 65, a long-time campaigner against under-age sex. The mother-of-10 said she was supporting him because no law was above criticism. Mrs Gillick, of Fenland Life Supporter Group, said: 'It felt like a sick joke to see someone like Ted at his age and infirmity threatened with jail.' Speaking after Atkinson was sentenced, a Queen Elizabeth Hospital spokesman said: 'This mail was opened by members of our administration staff who found it very disturbing and upsetting. 'Following an earlier case some years ago we were inundated with extremist mail from around the world.' 'All this had to be processed and responses provided, which used valuable public time and money.' 'The more extreme letters were referred to the police and appropriate action was taken.' 'No one deserves to be on the receiving end of hate mail. 'We will always take any steps necessary to enforce the NHS policy of zero tolerance in cases where the safety and well-being of our staff is under threat.'","Edward Atkinson sent a letter and disturbing images to the new chief executive of a Norfolk hospital .

A drunk British banker died when he jumped seven floors from a rooftop bar of a luxury Singapore hotel into the harbour while a friend filmed the dare on a mobile phone. William Hart, 37, was more than three times the legal drink drive limit when he climbed over the metal railings of the Lantern bar on top of the Fullerton Bay Hotel and announced he could 'make the jump' to the water below, an inquest heard. His friend saw a large splash in the water and rushed downstairs to look for him but, when he failed to resurface, asked hotel guards to help look for him. William Hart climbed over the metal railings of the Lantern bar, on top of the Fullerton Bay Hotel (pictured), and announced he could 'make the jump' to the waters below . An official search began an hour and a quarter later and Mr Hart's body was eventually recovered from the waters of the Marina three hours after he jumped on April 7 last year. Mr Hart - head of sales at the Bank of China International in Singapore - had performed similar stunts before, such as jumping from height into a swimming pool and other water features, Westminster Coroner's Court was told. A statement from Singapore inspector Joseph Yoong said Mr Hart’s body was found on the sea bed in water five metres deep in the Marina Reservoir. He added in the statement, which was read out to the court: 'Three hours before, on April 7 at 11pm, the deceased had jumped off the roof top of the hotel in an intoxicated state and plunged seven stories into the waters below. He died from drowning with multiple injuries.' The inquest heard that Cynthia Nicot, an Australian friend of Mr Hart, had seen him 'attempting to jump into the swimming pool from height in October'. She also confirmed Mr Hart had previously jumped into water features from height, Inspector Yoong's report added. Mr Hart's body was eventually recovered from the waters of the Marina (pictured) three hours after he jumped . The statement said: 'On April 7 the witnesses and the deceased were drinking at the Lantern located at the roof of the Fullerton Bay Hotel. The deceased had several glasses of wine. 'At around 11pm, while Maruki Yuki [a childhood friend of Mr Hart] and the deceased were drinking they commenced in walking around the rooftop. 'They stopped by the railings and Mr Yuki took out his mobile phone and filmed the deceased, wanting to show him what he said in the video when he was drunk. Whilst this recording took place, the deceased told him he wanted to jump down from the roof and thought he could make the jump. 'Mr Yuki told him not to play the fool and asked him to go home. Whilst Mr Yuki was still recording, the deceased climbed over the railings and jumped off the roof of the Fullerton Bay Hotel, which is about seven stories high. Mr Yuki looked over and saw a big splash in the waters. He rushed down to search for him but could not see him.' A search of the Marina started at 12.45am and his body was discovered at 2am. The video footage revealed the deceased wanted to jump off the roof - and he said he thought he could do so' Singapore Inspector Joseph Yoong . Inspector Yoong's statement added: 'The video footage revealed the deceased wanted to jump off the roof and said he thought he could do so.' Mr Hart, who was found with an alcohol level of 253mg per 100ml of blood, suffered several rib fractures and bruises as well as other injuries as a result of his fall. His brother Julian, who attended the inquest, described Mr Hart as 'an intelligent, ambitious, egalitarian and fun-loving person'. He said in a statement: '[He] loved his family and friends above all else and so was incredibly popular. Emotional intelligence was his forte. His need to interact with others was his life blood and strength.' He was educated in the UK and Hong Kong, gained a degree from Leeds University, studied law in York and practiced as a barrister in London before turning to banking. Mr Hart added: 'He was a keen sportsman and collected accolades in numerous sports growing up, including swimming and tennis.' An examination of the Lantern bar found that it met safety requirements with metal railings, the inquest was told. Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox said: 'Levels of alcohol showed he would have been clearly intoxicated and ability to respond to stressful situations such as drowning would have been impaired.' She said Mr Hart had been an 'extremely talented man' and that he was 'good fun and friendly' who 'clearly had a lot of friends'. She added: '[His friends] tried to stop him with the advice that he should go home. He didn’t listen.' Recording a verdict of accidental death, Dr Wilcox said: 'It is a very sad tale of a young man intoxicated doing something profoundly stupid which unfortunately took his life. It is such a tragic waste for those left behind him.'","William Hart climbed over the railings of a luxury rooftop bar and announced he could 'make the jump'

Richard Sharp, one of the former bankers hand-picked for a job with the new financial watchdog, donated more than £400,000 to the Tory party . A former banker hand-picked by chancellor George Osborne to help police the financial system donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Conservative Party. Richard Sharp, a 23 year veteran of Goldman Sachs, donated £402,420 in the decade before the Conservatives returned to power in May 2010, according to official records. He was appointed in March to the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, the new watchdog set up to protect the public from another financial meltdown. Last night Sharp’s role on the committee was slammed as ‘wholly inappropriate’. One insider said the donations are likely to be scrutinised by the influential Treasury Select Committee of MPs, which will grill new committee members over the next few weeks. ‘The parameters against which these appointments are judged are independence and competence. So it’s likely this issue will be raised.’ There are no rules banning members from making political donations. But in legislation published by the Treasury in January last year it said that the FPC may need to make unpopular decisions. It added that ‘it is vital that such decisions can be taken independently of undue political influence.’ The Bank of England’s code of conduct also stipulates that members must demonstrate they have no financial or other interests ‘that could give rise to a perception that the individual concerned could not be wholly independent, disinterested and impartial as a member of the committee.’ According to official records, Sharp has made no donations to the Conservative Party since 2010. But John Mann, Labour MP and member of the Treasury Select Committee said: ‘It’s wholly inappropriate for anyone giving a donation to any political party, particularly the party in power, to sit on that committee.’ Mr Sharp was one of the longest serving partners at investment banking giant Goldman Sachs - nicknamed Golden Sacks because of its lavish pay packages. He resigned at the end of 2006. Criticism: The Chancellor George Osborne, left, has come under fire from Treasury Committee member John Mann, right, for hand-picking Tory donor Richard Sharp for the top role . The 56 year old was one of four people outside the Bank  to be hand picked by Osborne to join the FPC, which is headed by Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King. Sharp receives a £55,000 salary for the part time job. Others appointed included Dame Clara Furse, the former boss of the London Stock Exchange. Welcoming the appointments Osborne in March he said: ‘The calibre and expertise of these four individuals shows we have also got the brightest and the best working on that committee.’ The FPC wields considerable power and has been charged with  spotting risks in the financial system to prevent future crises. It has ordered banks to raise an extra £25 billion to plug a giant shortfall in their capital buffers designed to cushion themselves against future financial shocks. Despite his long stint at Goldman Sachs, Sharp has been critical of bankers’ failings. In April he appeared in a fiery debate on banking on Channel 4’s comedy and current affairs programme 10 O’ Clock Live. Asked whether the financial system was safe, he said; ‘Hopefully not – there would be a big problem if bankers felt they could run their banks and not feel the consequences of bad decisions.’ The Treasury and the Bank of England refused to comment on the appointment. But insiders said the government appointed a recruitment firm and advertised for the roles. Sharp was interviewed by senior Treasury officials, including cross-bencher Baroness Hogg.","Richard Sharp, 56, made donations in decade up to May 2010 .

The British economy will perform better than all its major European rivals this year as the sluggish recovery picks up pace, a leading global watchdog said yesterday. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast growth of 0.8 per cent in the UK in 2013 – slightly weaker than the 0.9 per cent previously expected. But it slashed its forecast for the eurozone from a decline of 0.1 per cent to a reverse of 0.6 per cent – with Britain doing better than Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Recovery: The UK economy will grow by just 0.8 per cent, the OECD predicts as it urged investment in infrastructure to secure growth . Pier Carlo Padoan, the group’s chief . economist, said: ‘The British economy is recovering slowly and that . reflects the fact that Europe is doing poorly. Growth is expected to . pick up gradually through 2013 and 2014.’ The Paris-based think tank said . Chancellor George Osborne’s austerity plans were ‘appropriate’ and . ‘necessary’ and added that the outlook in the UK was far brighter than . on the Continent, where the situation is ‘dire’. But, in its twice-yearly Economic . Outlook report, it said ‘much more needs to be done’ to repair Britain’s . battered finances and bolster growth. The OECD called for increased . spending on infrastructure projects such as housing and transport to . help the UK overcome the ‘strong headwinds’ buffeting the economy. ‘Continuing to shift the composition . of public expenditure in favour of infrastructure investment would . enhance growth prospects,’ said the organisation, which cast doubt over . the decision to protect large parts of public spending from cuts, such . as the NHS, education and overseas aid. Jorgen Elmeskov, its deputy chief . economist, said: ‘We are perhaps somewhat doubtful [as] to the idea of . ring-fencing certain spending areas. That tends to lead to deeper cuts . in other areas which may not be warranted. ‘You may or may not want to cut down . less on health than on other areas, but that should be a result of an . assessment of the costs and benefits of doing it, not because you carve . out health and thereby impose bigger adjustments on other expenditure . items.’ But the report from the OECD, which . represents around 30 of the world’s biggest economies, will come as a . relief to Mr Osborne as the austerity debate rages on. Construction: Chancellor George Osborne, pictured on a visit to the Port of Liverpool, is urged to invest in house building . The International Monetary Fund last week called on the Chancellor to loosen the purse strings this year to bolster growth. But the OECD said further cuts are . ‘necessary to store the sustainability of public finances’. It warned . that prolonged weakness in the eurozone ‘could evolve into stagnation . with negative implications for the global economy’. Growth forecasts in Germany were cut . from 0.6 per cent to 0.4 per cent while the OECD now expects the French . economy to shrink by 0.3 per cent instead of expand by 0.3 per cent. Spain and Italy are set to fare even worse. Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the . European Commission, admitted that governments need to ‘do more to help . themselves get back to growth and move Europe beyond the crisis’. He . added: ‘There is no room for complacency.’ Mr Padoan said the pace of recovery . around the world was ‘still disappointing’ but insisted that ‘the global . economy is moving forward’. He called on the European Central Bank to . combat the recession through measures such as a money-printing programme . dubbed quantitative easing or QE. ‘Europe is in a dire situation,’ he . said. ‘The eurozone could consider more aggressive options. We could . call it a eurozone-style QE.’ The OECD said rising unemployment ‘is the most pressing challenge’ facing the region.","Economic watchdog cuts growth forecast for 2013 to 0.8% .

The girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, told officers 'she would be taken to Pakistan and shot and everybody back home would be told it was suicide', Luton County Court heard. She had fled her wedding reception, which was attended by up to 1,000 guests, and arrived at a police station 'in her pyjamas and in a distressed state'. It was also alleged death threats had previously been made against her if she refused to marry, counsel for Bedfordshire Police James Weston told a hearing yesterday. Luton Crown Court heard that in November last year His Honour Judge Sir Gavyn Arthur made three court orders against one of the defendants stopping her from arranging the child's marriage . Two women have been accused of conspiring to force the girl to marry breaching court orders already banning any arranged wedding. The court heard that in November last year His Honour Judge Sir Gavyn Arthur made three court orders against one of the defendants stopping her from arranging the child's marriage either in the UK or abroad, forbidding the woman to enlist another person's help in doing so, and prohibiting any harassment of that child. The orders were backed by powers of arrest. But in April, despite the orders being made, it is alleged the girl was married at a religious wedding ceremony and in May a large reception attended 'by between 550 and 1,000 guests' was held at a city hotel celebrating the event. It was following the reception that the child 'turned up in her pyjamas in a 'distressed state' at a police station saying she had been forced to a marry a man she had met just once. Neelim Sultana, representing one of the women, said her client was 'of good character' and strongly denied having anything to do with arranging the wedding. Gemma Lindfield, counsel for the second defendant, said her client 'was aware of the orders but not the terms of those orders' and also denied any breach. Both defendants were refused bail and remanded to appear again before the county court for an administrative hearing on Friday May 31. His Honour Judge Sir Gavyn Arthur, presiding, said it appeared to be 'a very sad case'.

The nation’s hard-working grandparents are saving families £7.3billion a year by taking over childcare, research has shown. They are throwing busy parents a ‘lifeline’ by looking after grandchildren for increasingly long hours. The findings, released by Grandparents Plus and Age UK, show the older generation care for 1.6million children, or 14.3 per cent of under-14s. The total number of hours they are responsible for childcare has also increased from 1.3billion to 1.7billion – a 35 per cent rise. As a result, the value of the work provided for free by grandparents in the UK now stands at £7.3billion, up from £3.9billion in 2004. The charities analysed data from . Understanding Society, the UK longitudinal survey which includes . information on the childcare of over 11,000 boys and girls. Caroline Abrahams, from Age UK, said: ‘Grandparents are such an important part of children’s lives. ‘They are, it would seem, playing an increasing role in providing an affordable way for parents to continue working.’ And Sam Smethers, chief executive of Grandparents Plus, said the Government should make it easier for grandparents to combine work and caring responsibilities. He added: ‘Grandparents are throwing a lifeline to families squeezed by falling real incomes and rising childcare costs. ‘The contribution they are making within their families and the wider economy is enormous and rising.’ When a grandparent did provide childcare, they undertook about 20 hours a week on average. This equated to an annual average saving of over £8,600 for a family with two young children. Younger grandmothers - aged 50 to 64 - who are fit, healthy and with younger grandchildren are the most likely to be providing the care to enable parents, particularly mothers, to work, according to the charities’ briefing paper. The number of hours grandparents are responsible for childcare have increased by 35 per cent . It calls for changes in retirement and state pension ages to take account of the ‘vital’ role of grandparents in providing childcare, enabling parents to work. Legislation should also make clear that grandparents are entitled to take emergency leave to provide care for grandchildren. The document says: ‘The planned extension of the right to request flexible working to all has the potential to make it much easier for grandparents to combine work with informal care and to retain both mothers and grandparents in the labour force. ‘It will be important for employers to respond sympathetically to requests from grandmothers (and grandfathers), and public sector employers could show leadership on this.’ Mr Smethers added: ‘Research shows that grandparents providing childcare tend to be grandmothers who are younger, fitter and healthier, but no longer working. ‘They are the very women who are being expected to remain longer in work to pay for healthcare and pensions in older age. ‘The risk is of an emerging childcare gap as grandmothers stay in paid work and are no longer available to provide care, with mothers leaving the labour market as a result.’","Grandparents Plus and Age UK said grandparents care for 14% of under-14s .

Beam me up: Anita Wood (near right), 48, and Margaret Wood (far right), 50, were photographed at their civil ceremony in the Star Trek-themed celebration at the home to Premier League football club Swansea City . The Star Trek fan was duly ‘beamed up’ to magistrates’ court where she was ordered to repay all the cash and . given a suspended  jail sentence. Mother-of-two Wood, then called Anita .

The pair held a civil partnership ceremony in 2011 at the Liberty Stadium, home to Premier League football club Swansea City.

All 40 of their guests dressed up as . the crew of the Starship Enterprise – with both of Wood’s sons wearing . Captain Kirk outfits. Wood said at the time: ‘We have always . been into the show. I watched the original series as a child and you . just enjoy the escapism and the humour of it all.’ But after the ceremony Wood carried on . claiming benefits, without telling the Department of Work and Pensions . her civil partner had a full-time job, Swansea magistrates heard. Make it so: Anita Wood (far left) met Margaret Wood (near left) on an internet forum for Star Trek fans. They had a civil ceremony and wore matching outfits based on Captain Jean-Luc Picard (right), played by Patrick Stewart .

After the case, Wood said her offence . had been ‘simply an oversight’. ‘It wasn’t intentional. We had declared . Margaret as a non-dependent but not a partner,’ she said. ‘I was . devastated. My whole family has been affected by it. I’ve never done . anything wrong in my life, or anyone in my family.’ Tal Davies, Swansea Council’s . investigations manager, said: ‘We are pleased our work is getting . results and will continue to find all those who steal benefits. ‘Benefits fraud is not a victimless . crime and last year alone 163 people were punished for benefit fraud . with prison sentences, community service orders, formal cautions or . fines and also had to repay their illegally obtained benefits.’ Live long and prosper: Wood (right) was ordered to repay the money she claimed as well as £150 court costs and a £60 victim surcharge .","Anita Wood, 48, hid the fact that Margaret Wood, 50, was her live-in lover .

Accused: Eric Joyce was allegedly involved in a confrontation with police and airport staff after leaving his mobile phone on a plane . Disgraced MP Eric Joyce has been arrested after allegedly pushing a police officer at Edinburgh Airport in a row over his mobile. Joyce, 52, had apparently left his mobile on an aeroplane after arriving on a flight from London and is said to have become abusive when he was not allowed to retrieve it immediately. Airport staff called in police and the MP allegedly ended up on the floor in the ensuing scuffle before being arrested. An eyewitness claimed seeing a passenger 'shouting and swearing' at officers after the plane arrived on Sunday. The former Labour MP is facing charges of breaching the peace following the alleged incident. He is currently serving as an independent after resigning from his party in disgrace. Joyce was previously arrested in March this year after allegedly being involved in a fracas in the Houses of Parliament. The MP was reportedly wrestled to the ground by officers in front of onlookers and loaded into a police van, and was banned from buying alcohol within the premises. However, he was later told he would face no charges over the incident. A source today told the Edinburgh Evening News: 'The handling agents called the police after a passenger became abusive towards them. 'When the police arrived the passenger seemed to push one of the officers. The officers attempted to calm him down but he became more and more aggressive. 'The officers then pushed him up against the desk and down on to the floor, where he was handcuffed. A policeman was on top of him, with his knee at the back of his neck.'

Disgrace: Former Labour MP Eric Joyce is now sitting in the House of Commons as an independent . Today an airport spokesman said: 'We can confirm that an incident did occur on Sunday evening and an individual was arrested for being abusive and confrontational towards airport staff and police. 'Behaviour of this nature is something we have zero tolerance for at Edinburgh Airport and police officers will act accordingly if the safety of our passengers and employees is put at risk.' A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'A 52-year-old man has been reported to the procurator fiscal in connection with an alleged breach of the peace, which happened at Edinburgh Airport on Sunday May 19.' Joyce was first elected as MP for Falkirk in 2000, the year after he resigned his post as a major in the Army, after publicly insinuating that the armed forces were racist, sexist and discriminatory. He regularly topped the MPs’ expenses table from 2005-6 until last year and in 2009-10 became the first MP to claim over £200,000. In 2010 he resigned as Shadow Northern Ireland Minister after being banned from the roads for a year for drink-driving. He admitted refusing to take a breathalyser after an unexplained accident near a petrochemical plant in Grangemouth. Labour are in the process of selecting a new candidate to stand for Mr Joyce's seat at the next election after he resigned from the party. However, the party suspended the process following concerns about 'membership recruitment' earlier this month. The move follows reports that the Unite trade union had recruited dozens of new members in Falkirk, potentially giving it the chance to influence the choice of parliamentary candidate.

Israeli archaeologists have uncovered a rare temple and religious figurines which date back nearly 3,000 years to the time of the Kingdom of Judah. They say the finds provide rare testimony of a ritual cult in the Jerusalem region at the beginning of the period of the royal House of David. Such idol worship was a major theme in the chapters of the Old Testament relating to the era, and is given in the holy book as a cause for the downfall of the Jewish kingdom. An Israeli Antiquities Authority worker holds . figurines found at the Tel Motza archaeological site: The IAA said on . Wednesday they unearthed a maze-like construction and a cache of sacred . vessels some 2, 750 years old . The discoveries were made at Tel . Motza, outside Jerusalem, during archaeological work taking place ahead . of new highway construction in the area. They were announced yesterday in a release by Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 'The ritual building at Tel Motza is . an unusual and striking find, in light of the fact that there are hardly . any remains of ritual buildings of the period in Judaea,' the dig . directors said in a statement. 'The uniqueness of the structure is . even more remarkable because of the vicinity of the site's proximity to . the capital city of Jerusalem, which acted as the Kingdom's main sacred . center at the time.' Archaeologist Anna Eirikh shows a horse figurine . at the site on the outskirts of Jerusalem: Experts say the finds . provide rare testimony of a ritual cult in the region at the start of the period of the royal House of David . Tel Motza and the surrounding region are well known for their archaeological importance. Many finds have previously been uncovered at the site, from a range of different periods. From the Nineties to the beginning of the present century, the site was excavated in preparation for the new route taken by Highway 1. At the time, the site's archaeologists proposed identifying it with the Biblical settlement Mozah, mentioned in the Book of Joshua - a town in the tribal lands of Benjamin bordering on Judaea (Joshua 18: 26). The proposal was based, among other things, on the discovery at the site of a public building, a large structure with storehouses, and a considerable number of silos. A view of the Tel Motza site: The area and surrounding region are well known for their archaeological importance. Many finds have previously been uncovered at the site, from a range of different periods . Aerial view: According to archaeologists, the current excavation has revealed part of a large structure, from the early days of the monarchic period (Iron Age IIA) At the time, archaeologists identified the site as a storehouse, run by high-ranking officials, for Jerusalem's grain supplies. The current excavations have revealed evidence that offers a new aspect to understanding the site. Anna Eirikh, one of the directors, told AFP that the discoveries were rare evidence of religious practice outside Jerusalem during the Judaean period. 'What we can say for sure is the figurines served for religious purposes, and that Tel Motza was a Judaean kingdom,' she said. The findings date to the 9-10th century BC, when the First Temple would have already been built in its Jerusalem location. The Jews of that era seemed to have kept some of the prevalent pre-Judaism practices alongside the mainstream worship in the Jerusalem temple, she said. Idolatry: Ms Eirikh points out the temple site and the altar used for religious rituals and practices. The finds indicate that Jews of that era seemed to have kept some of their prevalent pre-Judaism religious practices . Thou shalt have no other god: The worship of idols is a major theme of the Old Testament, with the Israelites being repeatedly punished by Yahweh for their idolatry . 'It's very interesting to see these religious artifacts and temple so close to Jerusalem, a walking distance,' Ms Eirikh said. 'We know very little about religious . practice during the Judaean kingdom, there are two or three more sites . of worship, and this is the closest to Jerusalem.' According to archaeologists, the . current excavation has revealed part of a large structure, from the . early days of the monarchic period (Iron Age IIA). The walls of the structure are massive, and it includes a wide, east-facing entrance. Conforming to the tradition of temple construction in the ancient Near East, the rays of the sun rising in the east would have illuminated the object placed inside the temple first, symbolising the divine presence within. A square structure which was probably an altar was exposed in the temple courtyard, and the cache of sacred vessels was found near the structure. This map shows the location of the Tel Motza archaeological site, just outside of Jerusalem, Israel . The Kingdom of Judah was founded following the break up of the United Kingdom of Israel after the northern tribes refused to accept Rehoboam, son of Solomon, as their king, the Bible says. The major theme of the Bible's narrative is the loyalty of Judah, and especially its kings, to 'Yahweh', the God of Israel, and their rejection of idolatry. According to the Bible, all the kings of Israel and almost all the kings of Judah were 'bad', which in terms of Biblical narrative means that they failed to enforce worship of Yahweh alone. Of the 'good' kings, Hezekiah (727–698 BCE) is noted for his efforts at stamping out idolatry - in this case, the worship of Baal and Asherah, among other traditional Near Eastern divinities. However his successors Manasseh of Judah (698–642 BCE) and Amon (642–640 BCE) are said to have incited the anger of Yahweh by reviving the worship of idols. The latest finds at Tel Motza suggest that at the beginning of the Kingdom of Judah the worship of idols continued among the people of Israel - even close to the centre of their religion in Jerusalem. Judah was eventually overrun amid competition between the Egyptian and Neo-Babylonian empires for control of the region - after its people and king had returned to idolatry. The assemblage includes ritual pottery vessels, with fragments of chalices (bowls on a high base which were used in sacred rituals), decorated ritual pedestals, and a number of pottery figurines of two kinds: the first, small heads in human form with a flat headdress and curling hair; the second, figurines of animals - mainly of harnessed animals. The archaeologists stress that 'the find of the sacred structure together with the accompanying cache of sacred vessels, and especially the significant coastal influence evident in the anthropomorphic figurines, still require extensive research. 'Ritual elements in the Kingdom of Judah are recorded in archaeological research, especially from the numerous finds of pottery figurines and other sacred objects found at many sites in Israel, and these are usually attributed to domestic rituals. 'However, the remains of ritual platforms and temples used for ritual ceremonies have only been found at a few sites of this period.' The site's directors said: 'The finds recently discovered at Tel Motza provide rare archaeological evidence for the existence of temples and ritual enclosures in the Kingdom of Judah in general, and in the Jerusalem region in particular, prior to the religious reforms throughout the kingdom at the end of the monarchic period (at the time of Hezekiah and Isaiah), which abolished all ritual sites, concentrating ritual practices solely at the Temple in Jerusalem.'","Finds offer evidence of a ritual cult at the beginning of the period of the royal House of David .

A businessman has failed in a bid to have his late mother's final will declared invalid because it was made after her memory started failing. A judge at London's High Court said yesterday that the law ‘upholds the right of elderly people to leave their property as they choose, even if their mental faculties have declined considerably’. He said: ‘This must include many cases in which they can no longer remember all the circumstances relevant to the division of their property between the people they wish to benefit.’ Siblings: Constance Simon, who died in January 2009 at the age of 91, has three surviving adult children - her eldest Jonathan, plus Robert Simon (left) and his twin sister, Hilary Woolley (right) Judge Nicholas Strauss QC was ruling . in a case in which members of a family have been involved a long-running . battle over their inheritance from mother-of-four Constance Simon. She made her last will at her 88th birthday party arranged by family members in December 2005. Mrs . Simon, who died in January 2009 at the age of 91, has three surviving . adult children - her eldest Jonathan, plus Robert and his twin sister, . Hilary Woolley. Her youngest son, David, died before her in 2004 of cancer soon after the suicide of Louis, one of his own sons. Mrs . Simon's assets at the time of her death - mainly to be shared between . her children and her dead son's estate - included a house on Wellington Road in St John's Wood, north-west London, valued at the time at £1.75million, and a flat in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, worth £262,500. The block of flats was on the site of a hotel where the family had spent ‘fondly-remembered holidays’, said the judge. Other assets included savings and . shares worth about £55,000 and 16 shares in R.W. Simon Ltd, a company . manufacturing trade moulds founded by Mrs Simon's late husband. Robert, who has an adult daughter, has been managing director since 1982. The judge said that, from about 2000, . before the onset of serious mental decline, Mrs Simon lived with Robert . and his wife, Michelle, at their house in Chigwell, Essex, but still . spent a night or two at Wellington Road. The . court heard that a will made nine years before the birthday had . favoured Robert, gifting him the Westcliff flat and his mother's 16 . company shares, said the judge. Ruling: The judge, sitting at London's High Court (pictured), said the law 'upholds the right of elderly people to leave their property as they choose, even if their mental faculties have declined considerably' A March 1993 letter recorded Mrs . Simon's reasons for favouring him including that he had been mainly . responsible for the family company's success, and that he had looked . after her and other family members. The . judge said: ‘Hilary believes that letter may have been wholly or in . part forged by Robert, but this was not put to him in cross-examination . and I must disregard it.’ Iris Jolly, March 2013A couple said they were left a £500,000 legacy by the 80-year old 'spoilt princess' because she was cross with her family - but were stripped of the money by a High Court judge. She ruled the will was invalid because Mrs Jolly was not in her right mind when she signed it. Terry Marley, February 2012 . The orphan got to see none of his . adoptive parents' £70,000 life savings after they signed each other’s . wills by mistake - and the Court of Appeal had no power to . correct the error. Christine Gill, October 2009 . The 58-year-old lecturer contested her parents' will after they left their £2.4million estate to the RSPCA - and won her legal challenge. The court agreed that her father coerced her mother into making the document that gave the charity their 287-acre land. Robert . did not attend the birthday party, held at the Wellington Road house, . when Mrs Simon made her final will. The will took from Robert his sole . right to the flat and the company shares. The . party was attended by mother-of-three Hilary, who lives at Crossley . Hill, Halifax, West Yorkshire, and Jonathan, of Shoeburyness, Essex, who . also has three adult children. The will was prepared and executed without Mrs Simon being medically examined, and without a solicitor being present. The judge said: ‘Since there have been . disputes about the running of the family company, the significance of . the 16 shares in the hands of one person might well be greater than . their financial value.’ Robert accused his siblings in court of ‘sinister and reprehensible’ behaviour. The . judge said that, since Hilary and Jonathan had benefited from the . changes at the expense of Robert, he had been bound to approach the . issue of knowledge of the new will and its approval with care. But . any initial suspicion there might have been was dispelled by the . evidence of Hilary and Jonathan and other witnesses which he found to be . ‘truthful and substantially accurate’. Rejecting . the accusations of ‘sinister’ behaviour, the judge found that Mrs Simon . knew that her existing will did not favour her children and their . families equally, and she wished to execute a will that did so. Home: Mrs Simon's assets at the time of her death - mainly to be shared between her children and her dead son's estate - included a house on Wellington Road (pictured) in St John's Wood, north-west London . All the family, he said, were agreed that . Mrs Simon was ‘throughout her life a delightful lady of great charm and . forceful character, and that she was devoted to her family including . all her children’. The judge said Robert wanted the . birthday will declared invalid because, by the time it was made in . December 2005, his mother was suffering from mild to moderate dementia . and therefore lacked mental capacity to make a valid will. The . judge agreed that Mrs Simon ‘was not capable of remembering her reasons . for preferring Robert in her previous will, or its terms’. But . he said to rule that Mrs Simon did not have testamentary capacity . ‘would be inconsistent with the authorities which support the right of . elderly people to make a will disposing of their property as they see . fit, even if their mental faculties are far from being at their peak’. The . judge said there must be many legal cases in which people could no . longer remember ‘all the circumstances relevant to the division of their . property between the people they wished to benefit’. He said: ‘To make this a qualification of testamentary capacity would be inconsistent with the case law.’ There . might be cases where it might be necessary for a testator to understand . the different provisions of an earlier will - but ‘this is not such a . case’. The previous valid . will made by Mrs Simon was nine years earlier. The beneficiaries of both . wills were ‘obvious’ and they all received substantial gifts, and no . one was omitted, said the judge. Mrs . Simon had been ‘reminded of the previous, unequal, will and could have . asked to see it to remind herself of its provisions’ but chose not to do . so. Seaside: Mrs Simon's assets also included a flat in Westcliff-on-Sea (pictured), Essex, worth £262,500 . Judge Strauss said the dispute over the company and other issues, including worries over inheritance tax, had gone on over many years. In October 2004, shortly after Louis's suicide and while David was approaching death, matters had come to a head. By then both David and Hilary were aware that their mother's will did not leave all her property to her four children equally. The judge said David had written in a family letter that he believed Robert had drawn up the terms of the then current will ‘in such a way that it was favourable to his, and his family’, and he wished to express ‘at this late stage in my life’ his disquiet over his brother's ‘cavalier attitude to the rest of the family’. David reminded other family members of one of his mother's favourite quotations: that ‘if she had just one apple left she would cut the apple into four equal parts’. The judge said Robert was greatly angered by David's letter, believing that Hilary was its real author and had taken advantage of David and ‘orchestrated this scam’. The accusation was denied by Hilary. Sarah Haren, appearing for Robert, asked the judge for permission to appeal against his ruling, saying the case involved ‘an important and interesting question of principle’ regarding Mrs Simon's capacity to execute a will. But the judge refused permission. Robert can still ask the appeal judges themselves to hear his case.","Judge: Law gives elderly people right  to leave property as they choose .

A judge has rejected requests to delay the trial of five Guantanamo prisoners accused of plotting the September 11 attacks because of a rat and mould infestation in their defence lawyers' offices. U.S. attempts to move forward the military tribunal proceedings have been thwarted for months by scheduling conflicts, religious observances, an Internet outage and a tropical storm. And the latest request to postpone proceedings relate to offices assigned to the defendants' lawyers at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base in Cuba. They claim conditions in the 1940s buildings are making them sick. Scroll down for video . On trial: Ramzi Binalshibh, left, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, right, are among the five detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay accused of masterminding the 9/11 terrorist attacks . Poor conditions: The detainees' defence lawyers say the environment in the office assigned to them at Guantanamo (pictured) is making them ill . A week of pretrial hearings was due to begin at the base on Monday morning for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the hijacked plane attacks that killed 2,976 people in the United States in 2001, and four alleged al Qaeda conspirators accused of providing money and other support for the hijackers. After an aborted attempt to try them at Guantanamo in 2008, the five were arraigned on revised charges during a chaotic 13-hour hearing in May that was marked by defiant outbursts from the defendants. There have been no hearings in the case since then. A hearing tentatively set for June was delayed because one of Mohammed's defence lawyers, a civilian death penalty expert, had to attend the execution of a client in an unrelated case. A July session was postponed to allow the defendants to observe the holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast during daylight hours. Hearings set for August were delayed when an Internet outage left the lawyers unable to access their electronic legal documents, and then cancelled altogether as Tropical Storm Isaac approached. It doused the base but caused no damage.

Court sketch: Another drawing shows (from left to right) Mustafa al Hawsawi, Ammar al Baluchi, Ramzi bin al Shibh, Walid Bin Attash and Khalik Sheikh Mohammad praying at their arraignment at the military court . In late September, the work space . used by the defence lawyers was shut down because it was infested with . mold, rat droppings and at least one decaying rat carcass. Cheryl . Bormann, a civilian lawyer for defendant Walid Bin Attash, said: 'My . eyes burn. I lose breath. Al of us suffer some sort of symptoms.' They asked for a delay, saying that without their work area they did not have resources to prepare for the hearings. However the judge, Army Colonel James Pohl, ordered a clean-up but ruled on October 5 that there would be no further postponement. The building has since been certified as safe by the base hospital's Industrial Hygiene Department, though some of the lawyers said it was still toxic and are working from a cramped high-security trailer inside the court complex rather than return to that building. Many buildings at the humid and tropical base are kept uncomfortably cold to keep the mould and vermin at bay. Defence lawyers want the judge to abolish a process treating as a top national secret any discussion of what happened to the defendants before being sent to Guantanamo in 2006 (pictured) The chief prosecutor, Army Brigadier General Mark Martins, acknowledged to journalists on Sunday evening that the tribunals were taking place in a 'relatively austere setting', but added: 'Justice is not determined by the plushness of the surroundings.' Many of the issues the court will address during this week's hearing pertain to secrecy issues. Defence lawyers want the judge to abolish a 'presumptive classification' process that treats as a top national secret any discussion of what happened to the defendants during interrogations in secret CIA prisons before being sent to Guantanamo in 2006. The judge will also hear news organisations' request to limit closing of the courtroom for secret sessions, and be asked to decide whether the U.S. Constitution governs the tribunals being held at the U.S. base in south east Cuba. In addition to Mohammed and bin Attash, defendants Ramzi Binalshibh, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and Mustafa al Hawsawi, are charged with conspiring with al Qaeda, attacking civilians and civilian targets, murder in violation of the laws of war, destruction of property, hijacking and terrorism. All five could face the death penalty if convicted.

Collier, 27, was about to start a new job with the Somerville Police Department when he was killed. Friends and family described him as born to be a police officer. Police believe the Boston bombing suspects shot Sean Collier five times before attempting to steal his gun .

'He came to see me a couple of months ago and he said, ‘Chief, I have . a chance to get on the Somerville Police,'' MIT Police Chief John . DiFava told the Boston Globe. 'I said, ‘Sean, you owe me nothing. You’ve done a fine job for . me. I would never stand in the way of someone trying to do better for . themselves.’' On the night Collier died, he was on duty near Kendall Square in Cambridge. DiFava had ordered extra campus security in the wake of the bombings. Collier joined the MIT force in early 2012 and was reaching the end of a 3 to 11:15 p.m. shift. By 9:30 p.m. he was on routine patrol, parked in the corner of Vassar and Main streets. Collier, who's lifelong dream was to be a cop, was set to join the Somerville Policed Department .

DiFava said he'd pulled his car next to Collier's to see how he was doing. 'Just making sure everybody behaves,' Collier replied. The two men talked for a few minutes before DiFava pulled away. Half an hour after the DiFava got home, the deputy chief called him. Robert Rogers, left, puts his hand on his stepbrother, Andrew Collier, after delivering the eulogy at a memorial service for Collier .

'Calculated': Francis Knight, 31, posed as teenage girls to target boys as young as nine on Facebook . A paedophile who hacked the Facebook accounts of teenage girls so he could prey on and abuse boys as young as nine has been jailed. Francis Knight stole the online personas of young girls to stalk and contact more than 250 children on the social networking site over two years. The 31-year-old used the cloned profiles to befriend six boys  aged between nine and 13 and persuaded them to carry out sex acts while he watched on a one-way webcam. A court heard how Knight had ‘masqueraded as teenage girls’ and even convinced some of his victims to perform sex acts with their friends for him to view. Even after the former Tesco store assistant had been arrested and charged, he carried on stalking youngsters online while on bail, Portsmouth Crown Court was told. Jailing Knight for 16 months, Judge John Dixon said he was a ‘manipulative individual’ with a predilection for young children and his actions were ‘calculated and artful’. Knight’s own father told the Daily Mail that his ‘disgusting’ son should have been jailed for much longer. Prosecutor Jane Terry told the court last week how Knight, from Portsmouth, would send ‘friend requests’, under cloned identities, to a group of people who knew each other. She said he wanted to lull his victims into a false sense of security as they believed they had mutual friends. During sentencing on Friday, Judge Dixon told Knight: ‘In those online exchanges you had with those boys you deceived them with a one-way webcam. You could see them but they could not see you. The deception left the victims ashamed of themselves, and their parents distressed and upset.’ Parents of some of the boys sobbed as they heard evidence of what Knight forced their children to do on camera. 'Manipulative individual': The former Tesco worker was jailed for six months at Portsmouth Crown Court after admitting inciting children to engage in sexual activity and making indecent images of children . The court also heard about the . effects on the girls whose profiles were targeted. Knight stole the . identity of one teenage girl – known to one of the victims – by hacking . into her Facebook page. She has now had to change schools because of the stigma attached to what happened, despite being entirely blameless. Knight’s father said last night that the family had disowned the paedophile. ‘What Francis did is disgusting and . will cause long-term damage to his victims,’ he said at his terraced . home in Havant, Hampshire. ‘Every member of the family condemns what he did and we want nothing more to do with him. ‘He . should have been jailed for longer – I understand one of the families . involved may be appealing for this and we wish them good luck.’ Knight . pleaded guilty to 17 offences at a hearing in April which involved 14 . counts of inciting children to engage in sexual activity, two counts of . making indecent images of children and one count of attempting to incite . children to engage in sexual activity. Detectives . from a specialist paedophile unit had interviewed all those who had . been contacted by Knight. Around half were from Hampshire with the rest . from Manchester. Detective . Sergeant Richard Wheeler, of Portsmouth CID, said: ‘I would like to . praise the children who have shown courage throughout this investigation . and provided evidence to form the basis of the prosecution case.’","Francis Knight, 31, hacked into or cloned teenage girls' Facebook accounts .

"By . Alison Boshoff . PUBLISHED: . 18:25 EST, 29 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:57 EST, 30 May 2013 . Chavvy: Tulisa Contostavlos, Chelsee Healey and friends partying at the Ocean Club in Marbella . What a difference a few months can make. At the finals of The X Factor last December she was a goddess in a glittering beaded gown, made by rising designer Hollie de Keyser. Thanks to stylists and the Cowell machine, she looked absolutely right next to a glamorous Nicole Scherzinger. But the Tulisa who is whooping it up in Marbella this week is a rather different creature - in huge heels, an inadvisable amount of harsh make-up, a cheap bikini and even cheaper tattoos. (The legend: 'Lucky You' inked just at her knicker line, seems a joke in particularly poor taste.)It's a striking reinvention - from glamour back to gutter, and let no one think that it is accidental. Indeed, Tulisa seems depressingly happy to be back in her original role as Queen of the Chavs. For as she said herself so eloquently in an interview just before The X Factor ended: 'I'm always going to be a hood chick. I like street clothes.' She added defiantly: 'I'm an inspiration for Broken Britain. I'm comfortable in my skin, it just p****s me off that other people won't accept it.' Simon Cowell thought that her 'real' views on The X Factor panel made a refreshing change from the showbizzy guff spouted by Louis Walsh et al. But he grew tired of her - last week ITV bosses confirmed Sharon Osbourne will be returning to The X Factor to replace Tulisa in the next series. So she is reclaiming her past, which lies in the gang culture of Camden, North London. Hence her no-label sunglasses, knock-off necklace and baseball cap. Now she is wondering what can come next. She is reportedly 'determined' to make it in Hollywood as a film star. But quite how they will take to the Queen of the Chavs is anyone's guess. Tulisa had extensive dental work before starting on The X Factor, including veneers and a painful gum lift. The cost was £12,000 although she seems to have received the treatment for free, and then plugged the dental practice on Twitter. Some serious bling - if it's actually Chanel that is and not just made from coloured nickel. In truth, the brand has nothing in its jewellery collection that would match up to this in size, and, of course, the label is much ripped-off. A similar massive 'Chanel' pendant can be bought online for £360. Tulisa was the glam star of Saturday night TV . Tulisa loves a manicure, and has worn mint green and blue nails on The X Factor. She also uses stick-on embellished nails by the brand Nazila. Here she is wearing a classic red polish, perhaps by her favourite brand, Barry M, which costs £2.50. From cheap and cheerful brand THB, this is a 'statement' bikini and costs £20.99. If you choose one of the preselected slogans such as 'Proppa Bang Tidy' or 'I'm In Ibiza, B***h' it costs £16.99,but Tulisa has paid the extra and had her own slogan: 'Don't Mess With My Style' etched on . Louis Walsh said that he could 'always' smell cigarettes on her and staff at The X Factor had to tell her that it was against the law to light up backstage on the show — but she and her friends apparently would do it regardless. Obviously she wasn't all that mortified by Gary Barlow's jibeabout her 'fag ash breath'. Despite the wet and wild atmosphere at the Ocean Club in Marbella, Tulisa appears to have chosen to wear a pair of pricey Louboutins. The Very Prive shoes have a 10 cm heel and cost £525. Branded with the logo of basketball team the Chicago Bulls, widely available for about £20. These look like Carrera Drift  sunglasses, worth about £85,  but on closer inspection lack the branding. A stylist said: 'They look like a cheap knockoff from a market stall.' Her favourite earrings, and even the efforts of stylist Gemma Sheppard haven't persuaded her to ditch them. She's had this pair for three years and they are said to be cheapo Golddiggaearrings worth about a fiver. No cheapies - Tulisa is wearing a £25,000 Rolex with a diamond setting. It is thought she bought it for herself after landing The X Factor job in 2011. She's a fan of bling — she gave her (now ex) boyfriend Danny Simpson a £20,000 Rolex Daytona and they Tweeted pictures of their timepieces. What a difference a few months makes: Tulisa who is whooping it up in Marbella this week is a rather different creature - in huge heels, an inadvisable amount of harsh make-up, a cheap bikini and even cheaper tattoos . Tulisa's bottom of the barrel bikini (left) and tacky tattoos (right) Tulisa was seen spraying Veuve Clicquot Brut yellow label around. It costs £36 a bottle, but given that the event she was pictured at was sponsored by Veuve Clicquot, it was probably free. Her favourite drink is white wine, and she said in an interview that she started drinking when she was aged 12. A collect ion of tattoos, the largest of which is a unicorn on her shoulder which she had done in2010. She has since added a 'The Female Boss' inking on her forearm after her debut album. Onher lower back, she has the lyrics to her track Intro: 'She is strong when she is weak, She is brave when she is scared, She is humble when she is victorious.' This tattoo was first seen inApril on another holiday in Vegas. And there is a new tattoo which reads 'Lucky You' and features a  Shamrock, peeking just above her bikini line. This is thought to have been done in February, at Demon Ink in Gosforth, Tyne and Wear, at the same time as her now ex-boyfriend having an inkingon his ribs.

A woman died in a freak riding accident after her horse fell and landed on top of her during an event and crushed her to death. Sally Amy had been competing in a 90cm show-jumping class at 2pm on Saturday riding her horse Tomadatchi, who was also known as Treacle. According to witnesses, the horse slipped while attempting a jump and landed on top of the 56-year-old. The horrific accident happened in St Lawrence, Jersey, where Mrs Amy was crushed by her horse . Although spectators, fellow competitors, the police and ambulance services rushed to help the mother-of-one she died died. Mrs Amy was taking part in an annual show when her mount, Treacle, slipped while making a jump, clipped the top pole and fell on top of her. Tributes poured in for Mrs Amy, from St Brelade, Jersey, a popular and valued member of the island's equestrian community. The Jersey Riding Club, which had organised the competition, paid tribute to the popular and experienced rider who had been a member of the club for a number of years.

Awkward questions: Google Boss Eric Schmidt speaking at a Google's Big Tent event in Watford this month . The boss of Google has declared himself 'perplexed' by public anger at the internet giant's meagre UK tax contribution. Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, hit back after politicians criticised the California-based company for generating billions of pounds from its UK arm, but giving precious little back in taxes. Google paid £10million in UK corporation tax between 2006 and 2011, despite pulling in revenues of £11.9billion. But Mr Schmidt said the company had done what it was 'legally required' to do and would not pay a penny more than the demanded. 'What we are doing is legal,' he said. 'I'm rather perplexed by this debate, which has been going in the UK for some time, because I view taxes as not optional.' 'I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required. It's not a debate, you pay the taxes.' He said that the fault for Google's low tax contribution lay at the door of politicians, who have not tweaked tax laws to catch up with a modern, globalised world. 'If the British system changes the tax laws, then we will comply. If the taxes go up, we will pay more, if they go down, we will pay less.' 'That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom,' he told the BBC. Google boss Mr Schmidt has previously admitted that he 'can't defend' an international tax system that he deems 'irrational'. But tax expert Richard Murphy, of the Tax Justice Network, said Mr Schmidt wasn't abiding by the law, but simply side-stepping it by routing UK sales through Ireland, where taxes are lower. 'Let's be clear, he's actually not paying the right amount of tax, he's getting round the law. If we change it, he'll try to get around that law,' said Mr Murphy. Unpopular: Multinational giants Amazon and Starbucks have suffered boycotts over public anger at their tax avoidance in the UK . He said Mr Schmidt's comments proved . that Britain needs a General Anti Avoidance Rule, which could be applied . to any attempt to lower tax bills artificially. 'That would have undoubtedly caught their tax avoidance and then Eric Schmidt would have to comply with UK law,' said Mr Murphy. Mr Schmidt's effort to turn the focus back on politicians comes just days after Google was accused of doing 'evil' by Margaret Hodge MP (Lab, Barking), who chairs the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee looking into corporate tax. Ms Hodge was referring to the company's famous motto 'Don't be evil', which she said did not stand up to scrutiny given its bargain-basement tax bill. Political agenda: Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use the G8 summit to push for a global battle on tax avoidance . 'You are a company that says you ""do no evil"". And I think that you do do evil,' she said. Ms Hodge has called for a new committee to oversee the tax affairs of major companies. She said the committee could hold secret evidence sessions with companies, to allow them to debate tax issues without causing firms any public embarrassment. Household names such as Amazon and Starbucks have suffered boycotts, as consumers react to revelations of their tiny tax bills by taking their business elsewhere. Mr Murphy agreed that a special committee should be set up to look solely at tax. 'HM Revenue & Customs doesn't have a minister responsible for it or a committee to review it and yet it's at the centre of British politics,' he said. 'It's time parliament took tax seriously and was given the funds to investigate just what's going on.' Tax avoidance has moved up the political agenda in recent weeks, ahead of next month's G8 summit of the world's economic superpowers. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use Britain's presidency of the G8 in 2013 to push for a global agreement on methods to battle tax avoidance. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is also drawing up a blueprint for global tax reform ahead of the larger G20 meeting of developed economies in September.","Google paid only £10million in corporation tax between 2006 and 2011 .

He denied a murder charge but pleaded guilty to GBH leading to the death of Chelsea Hyndman . A 25-year-old Briton has been found guilty of GBH leading to the death of his girlfriend on the holiday island of Crete three years ago. Luke Walker was found guilty of GBH leading to death after Chelsea Hyndman died on May 17, 2010. He had been charged with and subsequently denied her murder but judges at his trial at Heraklion Mixed Criminal Court tonight accepted a motion from the public prosecutor to downgrade the murder charge after it was argued he did not intend to kill Miss Hyndman. Walker was handed an eight-year suspended sentence. He was alleged by Greek prosecutors to have beaten 20-year-old Chelsea Hyndman, leaving her with injuries which are said to have led to her death three years ago. Miss Hyndman was admitted to hospital . in Heraklion, Crete, with abdominal pains in May 2010 and died the . following day. Heraklion Mixed Criminal Court heard she died as a result . of acute peritonitis. Walker - an electrician who was living . in the resort town of Malia where he and Chelsea worked in bars - . claims she fell during a night out. He denied one count of murder, and had . wiped tears from his eyes as a close friend told his trial today of the . plans the couple had for their future together before Miss Hyndman's . death. But separate evidence in the form of . written statements read to the court purportedly from one woman who . signed her name only as 'Jessie' and another from a man named as 'Peter . Rogers' alleged there had previously been violence in their . relationship. The typed letter from Jessie, dated . June 14 2010, said she knew the couple and that when Walker was sober he . was okay, but when they went out drinking he was jealous of other men . talking to Miss Hyndman. It claimed to know of two other times when Walker beat Miss Hyndman and kicked her in the stomach. The letter added: 'All do not know what goes on behind closed doors and they are too scared to come out to tell you.' Walker's friends and family shouted out in court as it was read and asked: 'Jessie? Who's Jessie?' Another document submitted to the . court that was sent to Greek Police from Peter Rogers said he had . overheard a conversation between Walker's father Patrick and a friend at . an event in the West Midlands in which he is claimed to have said that . Walker admitted to him he had hit Miss Hyndman when he was drunk. George Pyromallis, Walker's defence . barrister, submitted to the court that the documents could easily be . false and he was uneasy about them being allowed in evidence. 'It is troubling how this paper can appear in the case file and it could easily be forged,' he said. Scroll down for video . Court case: Walker, pictured left at his home in Brierley Hill, West Midlands, got an eight-month suspended sentence after the Greek court accepted the downgraded charge . Carefree: Ms Hyndman and Walker were both living on the Greek island and working in bars before she died . The court was also read a statement . from Eda Quirici, a neighbour of Walker and Miss Hyndman, who said she . often heard 'intense arguments' between the pair. She lived in the apartment below . them, and said: 'These arguments were so intense, so fierce, that I . could not sleep for the noise.' In her statement she said that though . she was not absolutely certain of the date, she remembers hearing an . argument in the apartment at around 4am on May 12 when she returned home . from her bar job. 'I heard the girl screaming like someone does like when someone is being chased or being beaten. 'I heard furniture being dragged about like when someone is trying to chase a person.' Young love: Walker is pictured kissing his girlfriend Miss Hyndman, whom he was accused of killing in May 2010 . Miss Hyndman, pictured left in Crete, died after suffering severe injuries to her abdomen. Walker, pictured right, denied the murder charges . Earlier Walker had broken down in . tears as he listened to a friend of Miss Hyndman tell the court how the . suspect had wanted to marry and have children with the girlfriend he is . accused of murdering. Lyndsay Williamson, who had been . friends with Miss Hyndman since 2007, said the couple had fallen in love . quickly and their two-year relationship was strong. Fighting back tears she told the court: 'He loved her 100 per cent. 'My impression of Luke was the same as . Chelsea's impression of Luke - they wanted to be together, they wanted a . future together, they wanted to get married, they wanted to have . children.' Walker, 25, of Brierley Hill near . Dudley, West Midlands, who sat behind Miss Williamson in court, put his . hands to his eyes and quietly cried as he listened to her evidence. The court heard that he and Miss . Hyndman, of Castleford, West Yorkshire, were 'very much in love' and . 'felt invincible'. Walker claimed Miss Hyndman sustained her injuries after falling over on a . night out . Miss Williamson said that in 2009 the . couple left Malia and returned to England to find work and also to work . on their relationship because they had been having some difficulties. She said they decided to go home for some space and because they wanted to make things work. She added: 'They were a little bit jealous of each other's past relationships with other people but not with any malice. 'I can't explain it any more than that they were a very young couple.' Walker and Miss Hyndman returned to . Malia together in 2010 because they felt they had worked through their . issues, they missed their friends, and were happier abroad. Miss Williamson said Miss Hyndman had . been like her 'little sister' and she would have known if anything bad . had happened to her or if anyone had hurt her. The court heard evidence yesterday from Louise Purdy, who had been on a night out with Miss Hyndman on May 6. During the night Miss Hyndman had . fallen over on a cobbled street, landing with her left hand under her . body near her stomach area, Miss Purdy told the court. The court heard that as the night wore on she told friends she was okay but had hurt her stomach a little. Delayed: Walker's trial started three years after his girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman died . Miss Williamson said that by May 11 she noticed a difference in Miss Hyndman. They had both spent time at the beach . and had got badly burned by the sun and later that day, when the pair . met up to go for a few drinks, Miss Hyndman 'seemed so out of it and . disorientated'. Miss Williamson saw her again on May . 12 and said Miss Hyndman was being sick and had stomach cramps and . thought she had sunstroke. She briefly saw her again as she was . going into hospital and asked if she wanted her to go too. Miss Hyndman . replied: 'I just want to be with Luke', the court heard. James Sharp, Miss Williamson's partner, said Walker and Miss Hyndman's relationship was strong. 'It was a good relationship,' he told the court. 'We did a lot of things together as partners, me and my partner and Luke and Chelsea together. 'Going round for barbecues...it was a good relationship.' Party town: Walker lived in Crete for two-and-a-half years, working in a bar in Malia, pictured . Case: Prosecutors claimed Walker punched or kicked Miss Hyndman in her stomach, causing her fatal injuries . Mr Sharp and Miss Williamson lived in an apartment opposite the couple and he told the court he would have been in a position to hear if they had an argument at home. He said he was in bed at home on the night that it is alleged there was a row between the pair. He was asked if it was possible if there had been a 'huge argument or a tremendous noise' that he would have been woken up, and he answered 'possibly'. A letter was also read to the court that Miss Hyndman's mother Heather, who was in court, wrote to Walker when he was in prison. He has since been granted bail by the court. In it she wrote: 'Luke, I know you and Chelsea love each other dearly. I can't believe it's ended like this. 'I'm sorry I haven't come to see you, I hope you can understand why. There's so many things going through my mind.' She said: 'Chelsea's coming home with me tomorrow' and said she would take care of her. She told Walker: 'I hope things work out for you' and added: 'I hope things will end soon so my baby can rest in peace.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Luke Walker, 25, walks free with eight-year suspended sentence .

A householder who trapped a suspected burglar inside his home told of his fury yesterday after police let the man go. Tim Ferris, 53, realised at 2.30am that there was a man inside the rear porch of his house and that he was trying to break down an inside door. He dashed out of the front door, ran round his house and locked the rear porch door, effectively trapping the intruder inside the porch space. Tim Ferris trapped a suspected burglar inside his home - only to be told by police they had later released him without charge . Angry: Estate agent Tim Ferris has criticised police after a man he caught trying to barge into his home was released without charge . But Mr Ferris, an estate agent, said . that after he had handed him over to the police, officers seemed . reluctant to arrest the man for attempted burglary and only did so when . he insisted. He claimed they refused to take his statement about the attempted break-in because they were already late finishing their shift. When he spoke to police the next day, he discovered to his fury that they had released the intruder without charge. They had seemingly accepted the man’s . explanation that he had drunkenly mistaken Mr Ferris’s house for his own . home, and was trying to let himself in. Mr Ferris said he did not believe the . explanation, and questioned why a drunk man would climb over a 4ft 6in . gate and try to ‘shoulder-barge’ his way into his own home. ‘It doesn’t . look like the police asked many questions or made much of an effort to . investigate the case,’ he said.. Dumfounded: Mr Ferris was woken by his labrador Sparky, left, to find a man trying to barge into his home through the back door, right, but police decided not charge the suspect with any offence . ‘This was despite the fact I had . caught the guy and detained him. I offered to give a statement and had . done most of the officers’ work. Their excuses for not charging him are . lame. ‘What is the point in trying to protect your home if the police do not back you?’ Mr Ferris said he was asleep with his . girlfriend at his secluded, detached house in February when he heard his . black labrador Sparky barking to raise the alarm. He raced downstairs . and locked the man inside the porch. Mr Ferris said it took police 25 minutes to reach his £850,000 home in Bearsted, near Maidstone, Kent. And he questioned why officers had later accepted the intruder’s explanation and released him. Mr Ferris said: ‘First police told me . the man had been drunk – but they didn’t charge him with being drunk and . disorderly and he seemed sober to me. Not happy: Mr Ferris said he cannot understand why police did not charge the man when he done 'most of the work for them' ‘Then they said he had mistakenly been . trying to get into the wrong house – but I heard him tell them he lived . about 15 miles away in Tenterden. ‘I was furious when the police phoned . me the following morning to say they were releasing him because he had . not done anything wrong. It was a farce. ‘If the man wasn’t drunk why didn’t they charge him with attempted burglary?’ Mr Ferris has made a formal complaint . to Kent Police about their handling of the incident. A spokesman said: . ‘A man was arrested at the scene but later released without charge. ‘We are carrying out a full review of . the incident. We will be working with Mr Ferris to resolve his . dissatisfaction with the service he received.’ The spokesman added: ‘It is absolutely . untrue to suggest people are getting away with crime because we don’t . have sufficient resources to respond to incidents and crimes in . progress. ‘We have officers available around the clock to respond to crimes.’","Tim Ferris, 53, found man trying to barge his way in through back door .

Her provocative pose, thigh-high stockings and black bondage-style bra look fit for the heroine of Fifty Shades Of Grey. In fact, the only thing missing is a riding crop. In other photographs, the heavily made-up twentysomething model wears lacy hold-ups, cut-out knickers and a plunging bodysuit which leaves little to the imagination. But this isn’t a campaign for Victoria’s Secret or even Anne Summers. Instead, they’re the newly-released images from Marks & Spencer’s revamped Autumn/Winter lingerie line, masterminded by its latest style director Belinda Earl. Black marks: M&S's lingerie collection is decidedly risque . Her new clothing collection for the struggling retailer was rapturously received when it was unveiled this month, with commentators praising the flattering cuts and grown-up detail. However, Belinda’s lingerie line is ‘adult’ in a rather different way. Judging by the pouting model and the very saucy styling, the nation’s favourite bra and pants outlet has shot itself in its suddenly slinky, stocking-clad foot. For who on earth thought that putting the S&M into good old M&S was a sensible idea? Could it be that falling profits and dire clothing sales have got someone’s knickers in a twist? After all, the average shopper at M&S is a size 14-16, 49-year-old mother who probably doesn’t want to go out feeling as trussed-up as an oven-ready chicken. 'Judging by the pouting model and the very saucy styling, the nation’s favourite bra and pants outlet has shot itself in its suddenly slinky, stocking-clad foot' In these straitened times, it also seems unlikely she’ll be willing to pay £19.50 for a pair of knickers and £35 for a slip from this collection. Most women I know go into M&S for comfy underwear that will wash well, doesn’t break the bank and won’t dig into the skin, bag, sag or show under clothing and will look subtly sexy in front of their husbands. They’re just not in the market for becoming Miss Whiplash. Just because almost every woman in the country has read Fifty Shades Of Grey doesn’t mean we want to act it out. And to assume so is, frankly, insulting. Now don’t get me wrong. I may be 60, but I’m no prude when it comes to underwear - or anything else. This week, I’ve been devouring a very raunchy contemporary retelling of Lady Chatterley’s Lover - I Take You, by Nikki Gemmell - in preparation for a Hay Festival debate about women and erotica at which I’m speaking. In Gemmell’s book, the heroine doesn’t wear knickers at all. Feminine: Linda approved of the sensuous silks and subtle prints in M&S's range with Rosie Huntington-Whitley . When Agent Provocateur entrepreneurs Joseph Corré and Serena Rees took risque underwear mainstream in 1994, they proved sexiness wasn’t just the province of men in dirty raincoats. Kate Moss and Kylie Minogue stripped off for the brand and it went global, with Corré and Rees reported to have sold 80 per cent of their business for a cool £60 million in 2007. Smalls are big business, as also evidenced by Victoria’s Secret’s flagship store on Bond Street. Women, these days, see no contradiction between femininity and feminism. Outrageous underwear is part of our seduction tool kit. I’m an underwear addict and love sexy smalls, but I don’t want to buy them from M&S. Why? Well, there’s enough pressure on women to act like sex objects 24/7 without M&S wading in. It’s like finding an old and trusted friend is moonlighting as a stripper. When I split from my husband at the age of 55, one of the first things I did was go on an underwear binge on a just-in-case basis. I bypassed M&S and spent an entire day at Selfridges, Myla and Calvin Klein before settling for three bra-and-pants sets (one in jade, one in raspberry and one in black), plus several pairs of hold‑ups, which set me back close to £300. Traditional market: M&S lingerie is usually popular because of its comfort over style . Even though I was worrying about how I was going to pay my bills, I felt this was an indulgence I deserved. It was many months before anyone actually got to see any of it, but these subtly sexy sets under my jeans and T-shirts gave me a confidence boost when I needed it most. And that’s where the M&S range goes wrong - it seems more about pandering to male fantasies than quietly making women feel good about themselves. With the multitude of straps and bondage-like constructions, I’m reminded of the Red Room of Pain in Fifty Shades Of Grey rather than getting the support I want when I wear something tight and want to avoid anyone glimpsing bulging back fat or a post-menopause pot belly. Of course, this bizarre departure from its heartland style could have a lot to do with the fact that the foundations of M&S’s underwear department have been crumbling for some time. In January this year, Janie Schaffer, former chief creative officer at Victoria’s Secret and original founder of the Knickerbox chain, was hauled in to revamp M&S’s lingerie. But by April, she had resigned, citing excessive red tape and meddling from on high, with insiders hinting there was a culture clash. Misguided revamp: Linda fears the new range could alienate die-hard customers of the ailing store . Then last week, M&S reported its lowest pre-tax profits for eight years, at just £564 million, compared to £658 million a year ago. This decline took place before M&S hired its latest weapon, Belinda Earl, 51, to stop the rot. But it seems that instead of underpinning her new strategy with underwear that’s as on-the-button as her classic outerwear, what women really want has been roundly ignored in favour of lingerie likely to attract headlines. Which is strange, as underwear is big business at Marks. It remains the nation’s leading retailer, selling more than 61 million pairs of knickers a year, with different shapes and sizes, ranging from six to 28. They say one in three women buy their lingerie at Marks & Spencer. What do they think this misguided revamp will achieve? New direction: Belinda Earl is M&S's latest style director . Of course, I expect M&S to modernise along with the rest of the High Street, but isn’t the point that Marks has always embodied traditional values? I go to there to feel safe and comfortable. I expect good value for money. When I talk to my friends, all ‘women of a certain age’, they want the same things from the M&S underwear department: sales people on the floor who can actually advise you (I’ve not been able to find one there for years, at least not without a 20-minute hunt and then practically having to beg for help); shapewear that doesn’t constrict; knickers that don’t leave you worrying about a visible panty line; and bras that give you a boost without looking like armour. The words ‘flattering’ and ‘feminine’ come up often; the word ‘sexy’, in relation to M&S, never. ‘I love saucy underwear,’ says one friend, ‘but I’m just not in the mood for it when I go to M&S.

A Columbia high school student is facing possible felony charges in criminal court after she was arrested for changing a classmate's name in the school yearbook to a sexually suggestive term. Kaitlyn Booth, 17, a student at Hickman High School in Columbia, Missouri was arrested May 14 on suspicion of changing a student's last name from Mastain to 'masturbate' in the yearbook. She could be charged with first-degree property damage, a felony, and harassment. Kaitlyn Booth, left, faces possible felony charges while prank victim Raigan Mastain, right, has said she 'wasn't devastated' over the incident . Booth also faces punishment at school, but Hickman Principal Tracey Conrad declined to discuss specifics. The butt of Booth’s prank, Raigan Mastain, told the Columbia Daily Tribute that she ‘wasn't devastated’ over the incident and was surprised the student was arrested. ‘When you're in high school, you do stuff that is not necessarily the smartest, and this was an example of that,’ she said. The issue was brought to the principal's attention the day the yearbook was distributed. Rather than pulping 700 yearbooks, students at Hickman High School spent 12 hours placing stickers on the altered page with Raigan Mastain's correct name on it . The school decided against reprinting more than 700 yearbooks, which would have cost $41,000, and instead yearbook staff spent 12 hours placing stickers on the altered page with the student's correct name. 'The yearbook staff worked diligently to retrieve the ones that had been handed out and to put the stickers over the pages of the yearbooks that were yet to be handed out,' said Principal Conrad. Mastain said she and Booth worked together on the yearbook staff, and although they weren't friends, she didn't think Booth had any sort of issue with her. She said she hopes Booth is doing OK. 'What she did wasn't right, but I don't think it should affect her for the rest of her life,' she said. The biggest frustration, said Mastain, was that everyone was focused on the name change instead of the yearbook, which she said she and other staff members had put countless hours into.","Kaitlyn Booth faces possible felony charges as well as school punishment .

He has a reputation for lateness, but Simon Cowell excelled himself when he turned up four hours behind schedule for filming on Britain’s Got Talent last week. Sometimes there is an excuse for such shoddy behaviour. For example, he will plead he has had a migraine, as he did last month when he was five hours late. At other times he will say, infuriatingly but truthfully, he was soaking in the bath while everyone was waiting for him. Scroll down for video . Dismal ratings: The Food Glorious Food team (from left) Anne Harrison, Loyd Grossman, Carol VordermanTom Parker Bowles and Stacie Stewart. The show got 2.7million viewers on its first outing - around half of what might be expected in its plum slot . On this occasion, apparently, he didn’t even offer an excuse. As you might imagine, this habit infuriates his fellow judges and the army of producers and technicians who end up working until nearly midnight to accommodate his eccentric schedule. But Cowell, once so insecure he needed a friend to help him walk past the bank of secretaries at the record company RCA, can suffer from curious black moods. His fear of failure is well known — some . friends such as the retail billionaire Sir Philip Green have confided . that they almost nod off during his long introspective monologues about . his career. And, right now, there are lots of reasons for the so-called Dark Lord of popular culture to feel lacking in confidence. He has just seen the worst-ever ratings . for the launch show of any TV programme that he has been behind — with . the painfully derivative format of his latest primetime offering, Food . Glorious Food. Puffed out: Simon Cowell has been cruelly dubbed 'Pieman Cowell' in newspaper headlines after viewers noticed his face appeared puffy . It got a dismal 2.7 million viewers on its first outing on ITV, and 2.4 million on Wednesday night last week. That’s about half what you might expect in a plum slot after Coronation Street. This was particularly galling for Cowell, as he was heavily involved in the concept and execution of the show. He said before it went out that he was ‘really nervous’, and conceded that success or failure in TV was ‘all about ratings in the end’. The past 12 months have seen a succession of failures. Starting with an ‘unauthorised’ biography about him by respected author Tom Bower — with whom he co-operated — it has been an unhappy year. His TV talent shows have started to look tired and lose audiences, his new ideas haven’t taken root, his judges keep on quitting, and he has fallen into a fractious relationship with the TV networks who are his paymasters. On a personal level, he has struggled to get a grip with his weight or his addiction to cigarettes and remains, at 53, single and dependent on ex-girlfriends — some of them on his payroll — for company. One old friend told me: ‘His success has been unparalleled, but in the end he is a victim of it, because it’s fading away and he seems unable to do anything to stop it.’ There are worrying stories of Cowell, long known for his hypochondriac reliance on vitamins and smoothie health drinks, developing serious anxieties over germs. Apparently he throws away teaspoons if they have been used to eat yogurt for fear of bacteria, and has installed gel hand sanitiser units in his dressing room. It’s all a little bit like the infamous American recluse Howard Hughes. More seriously, some media analysts believe his annus horribilis may be the beginning of the end of what has been a promethean career. Steve Hewlett, a former programmes . boss at Carlton, summed up Cowell’s success to me, saying that he ‘was . the right person in the right place at the right time . . . but that . doesn’t mean that he has a tin of fairy dust and can do it again’. So what has gone wrong? Clash: Hiring Gary Barlow as an X Factor judge alongside Nicole Scherzinger, Tulisa Contostavlos and Louis Walsh was the decision of ITV and against Cowell's wishes . The publication of the Bower book, Sweet Revenge, seems to have been his first misstep. It featured some headline-grabbing revelations — such as his affair with X Factor judge Dannii Minogue and about him feeling manipulated by a flirtatious Cheryl Cole. Yet Cowell was deeply embarrassed by the revelations and by the schoolboy-ish comments attributed to him when he lusted after Cole and his nights of passion with Minogue. In its immediate wake, there were clashes over the hiring of Gary Barlow as a judge for The X Factor, which was the decision of ITV and against Cowell’s wishes. And his relationship with the network . was soured further last May when Shu Greene, who had been his right-hand . woman since 2004, left his company Syco to work for ITV. In . her new job, she devises and then puts on screen new entertainment . formats for the network, meaning she is in direct competition with her . old boss. He was so rattled he rang ITV executive . Denise O’Donoghue to remonstrate about them taking Ms Greene from him. A . few weeks after that call, Cowell was bedridden with what seems to have . been a near-breakdown. He took six weeks off work. Blow: It is now said that ITV sees Ant and Dec as more important to the success of Britain's Got Talent . Cowell later confided to friends that the long-term pressure of running his empire on both sides of the Atlantic — the time difference is up to eight hours — had turned him into a ‘weird vampire’, answering texts and messages through the night. Within days of returning to work — launching The X Factor USA — he was smoking constantly and working 20-hour days. Nor has the American show been a success. Despite installing Britney Spears on the judging panel, it performed poorly, losing three  million viewers compared with the previous year. And viewers noticed something had happened to Cowell’s face. His cheeks were puffy and he seemed to have acquired a double chin. The headlines were cruel. He was called ‘Pieman Cowell’, and one publication asked: ‘What’s happened to Simon Cowell’s face — and is it just for Hallowe’en?’ Cowell didn’t find it funny. The problem, according to a source in Los Angeles, was he had put on 15lb through comfort-eating, while continuing to have Botox injections and plumping face-fillers. He has been seen in the Whole Foods health food store near his LA home spending more than 45 minutes studying vitamins and supplements. Each day he has three ‘super’ smoothies for breakfast (in search of eternal youth). The recipes have been devised by French scientists and ingredients include lingonberry, acerola berry and chokeberry. Once a week, he has an intravenous drip that administers vitamin B12, vitamin C, magnesium, and, in his words, ‘something for your liver’. Last September, he also hired a personal trainer. But he detests training sessions and they haven’t had the desired result of helping him to shift the weight. An old friend told me: ‘He is a real contradiction: he smokes and he can’t sleep, and he lives a completely workaholic bachelor lifestyle, which is very bad for him. But then he has every health fad going. He claims they balance each other out!’ The big question is: would he approach life in quite such an extreme manner if his television shows were all a roaring success? The last series of The X Factor in the UK was the least watched since 2007 and the final had the worst rating in seven years. It was beaten consistently by Strictly Come Dancing on BBC1. Red Or Black, a gameshow with Ant and Dec aired last September, was also a massive and expensive flop. Cowell has also fallen out with some of his star hirings. Gary Barlow,  Britney Spears and record producer LA Reid mutter they don’t want to continue, and Cowell has said he doesn’t want Tulisa Contostavlos  to return as an X Factor judge. Falling out: There have been mutterings that star hiring Britney Spears does not want to continue on the US version of X-Factor. Cowell is said to be keen on hiring Lady Gaga and Katy Perry to replace her . He is trying to assemble two ‘dream team’ judging panels for The X Factor on both sides of the Atlantic. In America, he is keen to see Lady Gaga and Katy Perry behind the judges’ desk. In the UK, the new series may be presided over by Barlow, Sharon Osbourne, Louis Walsh and singer Rita Ora. In a further blow to Cowell’s ego, it is now said ITV sees Ant and Dec as more important to the success of the UK show, and Cowell could face a pay cut when they renegotiate the terms of his production deal. Steve Hewlett, now a media analyst, says: ‘What happened with The X Factor is that Simon Cowell had his moment. His personality, and his background in the music industry, and his work ethic and his instinct were all perfect. ‘But although The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent have been very successful shows, they are petering out, just like the talent shows that went before them. It is cyclical and you cannot fight it.’ That won’t stop Cowell trying. He has just announced a global talent show, to be screened on YouTube, from the end of this month. He is also working on a family TV concept, an updated Noel’s House Party, which he plans to pitch in the coming weeks to ITV and the BBC. At some point, though, the man who is a tireless perfectionist and puts himself under such tremendous pressure, must be forced to realise it is impossible for anyone to remain the best at everything.","Food Glorious Food receives worst-ever ratings for a Cowell show .

"By . Charles Walford . UPDATED: . 17:37 EST, 27 January 2012 . Flanders fields today bears little sign of the four years of war that claimed so many thousands of lives and ravaged this small corner of the Western Front. But further down, deep below the surface there remains a constant reminder of the bravery and daring of the men who risked their lives for their country. Beneath the farmers ploughs, most of the tunnels and dug-outs hewn from the earth by English pitmen to literally undermine the German offensive remain intact, untouched for almost 100 years. They were also the scene of fierce hand-to-hand combat between diggers from both armies, as portrayed in the Sebastian Faulks novel Birdsong. The tunnel sealed off by British troops during the First World War was excavated in 1997 and found to be intact . Tunnel engineer Johan Wanderwalle discovered that the tunnels had flooded, but remained intact in the 80 years after the First World War . The British Tunnelling Companies were . formed in the early months of the war to counter the German miners who . were blowing British trenches from shallow underground workings. Pitmen from mining . communities in Wales and the north and the ‘clay-kickers’ who built the . London Underground and the Manchester sewers were recruited, some from . infantry battalions others direct from civilian life. Not only did, they offered vital support to the war effort, providing protected shelter for the troops.By . the time Armistice came the secret underground army had dug mile after . mile of tunnel and hundreds of deep dug-outs designed to house . headquarters, hospitals, stores and men. The excavation uncovered a number items that had belonged to German soldiers such as bottles, a shoe, digging tools and even a gun and some bullets . Still intact: Another shot of the items discovered in the tunnel, seen from another angle - spades presumably used to carve out the tunnel can be seen on the left . Leftovers: A close up of the various items discovered in the tunnel, including a shoe and some bottles . These . never seen before images of one of the tunnels were taken by British . photographer Jeff Moore during an excavation with tunnelling engineer . Johan Wanderwalle in 1997. And . the story behind the tunnel found by Mr Wanderwalle echoes the action . in Birdsong, an adaptation of which is currently being screened by the . BBC. The . tunnel was being dug by British troops to undermine the Germans who were diggning in the opposite direction, Mr Moore told Mail Online. But . the . German soldiers realised what was happening and changed course and dug . into the clay-kickers’ tunnel before the British troops had a chance to . lay explosives. Dramatised: A still from BBC adaptation of Sebastian Faulks' classic novel Birdsong showing British troops in the tunnel . In the novel Birdsong, Stephen Wraysford (played by Eddie Redmayne, pictured, in the current BBC adaptation) is trapped by an explosion in an underground tunnel . This picture, taken in 1915, shows diggers making a bore-hole for a secondary chamber, intended to cause the enemy tunnel to fall in . There was an underground fight before the British soldiers pulled out and sealed up the tunnel. Such fighting was not uncommon. With so much mining activity being carried out by both sides, detection and breakthrough into each others tunnelling systems occurred frequently. For this purpose the British diggers prepared a 'camouflet', a pre-prepared charge which was always ready during tunnelling. If that wasn't detonated, vicious hand-to-hand fighting with picks, shovels and wood used as makeshift weapons might take place. The restrictions and conditions of the underground tunnels meant the miners could not use their rifles. If the opposing side were unsuccessful in repelling an attack, then enemy tunnels could be used for short periods to observe enemy tunnelling activity and direction. During the 1997 excavation Mr Wanderwalle found a number of items belonging to the Germans - as well as the bodies of four dead soldiers. Mr Wanderwalle said: ‘Above ground everything was cleaned up and re-built after the war and there is no sign that anything happened here but once you get underground you find everything just as it was all those years ago.’ 'My first one was in 1990. No one had done it before then so my friends and I had to learn how to work underground. The entrances were filled up with earth and rubbish after the war so you have to carefully dig them out. Haunting: Tunnel engineer Johan Wanderwalle stands inside the water logged tunnel which he explored with photographer Jeff Moore 15 years ago . 'Once you get past the entrance you find everything is as it had just been left, as if it had just happened. The waters came in and flooded it and preserved everything just as if it was yesterday. 'I have done so many now I can look at the entrance to a tunnel and I know by the way the timbers are arranged which of the Tunnelling Companies built it but inside everyone is different, you never know what you'll find.' One of the first World War survivors who . was involved in protecting the tunnels first hand was Albert 'Smiler' Marshall who was serving in the trenches with the Essex Yeomanry in 1915 . when he was caught in a mine blast. Remnants of war: Tunnel engineer Johan Wanderwalle holds a rifle found in the tunnel . Albert 'Smiler' Marshall was serving in the trenches with the Essex Yeomanry in 1915 when he was caught in a mine blast - he was found after singing Nearer My God To Thee . Royal Engineer tunnelling companies were specialist units of the Corps of Royal Engineers within the British Army, formed to dig attacking tunnels under enemy lines during the First World War. The stalemate situation in the early part of the war led to the deployment of tunnel warfare. After the first German Empire attacks on 21 December 1914, through shallow tunnels underneath no man’s land and exploding ten mines under the trenches of the Indian Sirhind Brigade, the British began forming suitable units. In February 1915, eight Tunnelling Companies were created and operational in Flanders from March 1915. By mid-1916, the British Army had around 25,000 trained tunnellers, mostly taken from coal mining communities. Almost twice that number of ‘attached infantry’ worked permanently alongside the trained miners to carry out grunt work. From the spring of 1917 the war became more mobile, with grand offensives at Arras, Messines and Passchendaele. The tactics and counter-tactics required deeper and deeper tunnelling, so offensive and defensive military mining largely ceased. Underground work continued, though, with the tunnellers concentrating on deep dugouts for troop accommodation, a tactic used particularly in the Battle of Arras. His experience was not dissimilar to . that of Stephen Wraysford, the character from Sebastian Faulk novel . Birdsong, who gets caught up in a blast from underground mines with his . friend, a tunneller called Jack Firebrace. In . an interview before he passed away 'Smiler' said: ‘We knew there was . tunnelling going on around and about because our engineers were working . there and we used to help them with carrying parties and protection and . that sort of thing. 'Somehow . or other our intelligence got to know there was a German mine . underneath us and when they were going to blow it up we came out of that . section of trench but we didn't come out far enough because we didn't . know exactly the spot where it was or how much explosive they had. 'There . was this terrific bang and it made a damn great crater you could drop a . house into and two of our chaps got buried there. Others got buried . with just their two legs, some were up to their waist and one had only . just got his head out. 'I got hit. I'd have been alright if I hadn't fell down only there was so much dirt came down on us it knocked me on my back and as I laid on my back in the trench my leg got trapped and I couldn't move it. 'Eventually it settled down a bit and someone shouted “is Smiler alright?”, so I shouted out that I'm quite alright but I can't move and I'm lying on my back in the trench and I've got to wait 'till someone comes to dig me out. 'The voice was shouting ""tell him to sing"" so that was how they found me, lying down there singing Nearer My God To Thee. Two men were buried completely and that was their grave, we didn't have time to bury them properly.' Smiler's comrades joined the list of 54,896 ‘missing; British soldiers who still lie in the fields in Ypres, their names recorded on the nearby Menin Gate, their bodies obliterated by shellfire or hastily interred in shallow graves and never found by the burial parties on their grim rounds after the war.

Since 2001, the panel has ruled on 12 cases and approved seven claims. All were among the crateloads of an estimated 100,000 paintings and antiques, taken from Jewish families after Germany invaded France in 1940. The seven paintings were destined for the Fuhrermuseum - an unfinished museum that Hitler wanted to build in Linz, Austria, where he grew up.

The Spoliation Advisory Panel was set up by the Department of Culture Media and Sport in April 2000 to help resolve claims of lost cultural property now held in UK national collections. The panel is chaired by the Rt Hon Sir David Hirst retired Lord Justice of Appeal, and considers claims for the return of objects. Between 1933 and 1945 the Nazi regime seized many works of art and cultural property in Europe. These works of art were later sold and resold, some finding their way to museums. Despite efforts following World War II to return looted and stolen property, many works of art still require restitution. Public awareness of the extent and significance of Nazi looting (or spoliation) has grown significantly over recent years. Across the world, Holocaust survivors and the descendants of victims are now attempting to trace and recover works of art that were lost during the Nazi era. The Declaration of Principles, agreed at the Washington Conference on Holocaust-era Assets in 1998, included the encouragement of heirs to come forward and the need to make information accessible. Bruno Saunier, deputy . director of collections at the French Service of Museums, said the decision to return the artworks was  'quite exceptional'. 'We only . restitute one work a year on average,' he told The Times. It follows a 12-year battle by 82-year-old Tom . Selldorff, from Massachusetts, who made a request in 2001 for the paintings that once belonged to his grandfather to be returned. His is a descendent of Richard Neumann, an Austrian industrialist . who moved to France and then sold his collection to pay for his family . to flee to Cuba to escape deportation.. Mr Saunier told The Times: 'It was very complicated. We had to go through our archives and the archives of the Neumann collection and piece together the history of these works after they had been sold.' Six of Mr Neumann's 18th century Italian and German paintings were found, three in the Louvre, the others in regional museums. They include Portrait of Bartolomeo Ferracina by Alessandro Longhi, Abraham and the Three Angels by Sebastiano Ricci, The Apotheosis of John of Nepomuk by Francois-Charles Palko, The Allegory of Venice by Gaspare Diziani, Saint Francis of Paola by Franceso Salvator Fontebasso and The Miracle of Saint Eligius by Gaetano Gandolfi. The seventh work, The Halt, by Pieter Jansz van Asch is to go to the descendants of Joesf Wiener, a Czech banker whose collection was taken by the Gestapo before he was deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp, where he was killed in 1942. Three paintings held by The Louvre in Paris are among those being returned to their Jewish owners by the French Ministry of Culture .

Her willingness to replicate Sharon Stone’s infamous Basic Instinct pose suggests that Lindsey Vonn is not one to shy away from controversy. But if you were left in any doubt, the revelation that the Olympic gold medallist is dating disgraced golfer Tiger Woods ought to remove it once and for all. The pair this week released a portrait that confirmed America’s most successful skier has teamed up with its most successful golfer – and, arguably, worst husband.

For while 28-year-old Vonn may resemble Nordegren with her blonde hair and platinum smile, the two could not be more different. Nordegren is aloof, with an interest in European politics and a loathing for media attention, while Tiger’s new birdie has quite a reputation as the glamour girl and the joker of the Alpine skiing circuit. She’s also no stranger to racy photoshoots and glossy endorsements, having posed for Sports Illustrated magazine’s swimwear issue.

Release: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been released from a civilian hospital . The surviving suspect in the Boston marathon bombings has been released from a civilian hospital and transferred to a federal medical detention center in central Massachusetts. The U.S. Marshals Service said today that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev left Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center overnight and was taken to the Federal Medical Center Devens about 40 miles west of Boston. The minimum security facility, on the decommissioned Fort Devens U.S. Army base, treats federal prisoners and detainees who require specialized long-term medical or mental health care. It has been referred to in the past as 'agreeable' and 'fairly pleasant'. It is designated as an administrative facility, which means it has inmates from different security classifications, from white-collar criminals to mobsters and sex offenders. The medical center currently houses 1,000 inmates with 124 in a minimum-security satellite prison camp. It costs around $157 for each inmate per day. According to its website, these minimum security prison camps, have dormitory housing, a relatively low staff-to-inmate ratio, and limited or no perimeter fencing. They are usually work-and-program oriented and inmates help serve the labor needs of the larger institution or base. Former NYPD officer William Masso, former New Jersey assemblyman Daniel Van Pelt and one time Underworld mafia boss John Franzese, 96, are currently inmates there. The medical center inmates are often allowed to leave the facility to see outside specialists and for tests and medical procedures not available in the medical center. The Federal Bureau of Prisons is focused on preventing rehabilitation by encouraging inmates to participate in a range of programs that have been proven to reduce repeat offending. The level of security which Tsarnaev will be held under depends on his changing circumstances - because he is a pretrial inmate - and he has no set protocol at this time. Tsarnaev will have access to medical and dental care, and the prison's handbook states that inmates have the right to a healthy, nutritious diet, as well as information about staying healthy while behind bars.

According to its website, these . minimum security prison camps have dormitory housing, a relatively low . staff-to-inmate ratio and limited or no perimeter fencing. They are . usually work and program oriented and inmates help serve the labor needs . of the larger institution or base. The medical center inmates are often . allowed to leave the facility to see outside specialists and for tests . and medical procedures not available in the medical center. The prison has regular onsite specialists in cardiology, nephrology, endocrinology, surgery, neurology and pulmonology. Current and former inmates are: . John Franzese, 96, former Underboss of the Colombo crime family in New York City. He is currently serving an eight-year sentence for racketeering conspiracy in 2011. He is also suspected in numerous Mafia-related murders. Daniel Van Pelt, 48, a member of the New Jersey State Assembly from 2008-2009. He is currently serving a 41-month sentence for bribery. He was arrested in 2010 for accepting $10,000 to provide environmental permits for a development project. Sabri Benkahla, 38, member of the Virginia jihad network. He is currently serving a ten-year sentence for perjury and obstruction of justice after he was convicted of lying to FBI agents and a grand jury about a training camp run by Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani terrorist organization with ties to al-Qaeda. William Masso, former NYPD officer. He is currently serving a 57-month sentence after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in 2012 for leading a gun trafficking ring comprised of active and retired police officers. It . has been revealed that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,  initially confessed to . authorities that he and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, . carried out the attacks during 16-hours of questioning over the weekend. Dzhokhar has been communicating with . law enforcement officials by writing on a pad after suffering an injury . to his throat during the frenzied manhunt for him which renders him . unable to talk. However, . the moment he was read his rights on Monday - which as a citizen of the . United States entitle him to the constitutional right to remain silent . and seek a lawyer - he stopped communicating. Indeed, . it has been claimed that federal agents were surprised when a . magistrate judge and a representative from the U.S. Attorney's office . entered the hospital room and read Tsarnaev his rights, four officials . and one law enforcement official said. Investigators had planned to keep questioning him. This apparent confusion came after the White House decided against treating Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant. It is unclear as to whether this will . matter in court as the FBI says Tsarnaev has already confessed to a witness. A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said: 'Before being advised of his rights, . the 19-year-old suspect told authorities that his older brother, . Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently had recruited him to be part of the . attack'. The debate over whether suspected . terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a sticking point. Many Repuplicans believe they hinder intelligence gathering. The Department of Justice has said . investigators may wait until they have gathered intelligence about other . threats before reading those rights in terrorism cases. Investigators have found . pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and are analyzing . them, officials said. One official described the detonator as 'close-controlled,' meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs. Dzhokhar is recovering in a hospital . from injuries suffered during a getaway attempt last Friday. Police had . previously said Dzhokhar exchanged gunfire with them for more than an . hour last Friday before they captured him inside a boat in a suburban Boston neighbourhood. A piece of remote control equipment has been found amongst the debris at the scene of the bombing. Experts say it would have been triggered just blocks away from the site of the bomb . Confused reports about the shootout in a Boston backyard have emerged. Officials now claim that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was unarmed as he hid in boat in Watertown. This contradicts Boston Police Commissioner's account of hour-long firefight with Tsarnaev . But yesterday, two unnamed officials . said that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions . about the gunfire and how he was injured. The report contradicts the Boston police department's own account of Dzhokar Tsarnaev's capture - after commissioner Ed Davies describes a firefight between him and officers before the terror suspect was captured. More than 4,000 mourners at the . Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police . officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing . suspects. Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice . President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as 'two twisted, . perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis.' Mr Biden paid tribute to officer Sean Collier's family: 'The moment will come when the memory of . Sean is triggered and you know it's going to be OK. The purpose of . terror is to instill fear. You saw none of it here in Boston. Boston, you sent a powerful message to the world.' U.S. Vice President Joe Biden gives his respects to police officers at memorial services for officer Sean Collier, who authorities say was shot dead by the Boston Marathon bombing suspect . Investigators have said the . brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on . the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist . group. Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in . Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, released from a civilian hospital today .

At the height of the Swinging Sixties, the decade’s biggest names – Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Terence Stamp, Peter Sellers and Greek tycoon Aristotle Onassis – enjoyed an enviable existence, partying the nights away in Chelsea, sunbathing in Mexican resorts and cruising the Mediterranean on luxury yachts, while hordes of paparazzi pursued them, intent on immortalising their every moment. Little did the packs of photographers know that their illustrious prey often escaped to a secret hideaway: a single-storey house on Sydenham Hill in South-East London. It was owned by the late writer Peter Evans, their friend and confidant who chronicled them all in Goodbye, Baby & Amen, the book he and legendary photographer David Bailey published. Humble facade: The home of late writer Peter Evans where he entertained the stars of the Sixties has been put on the market by his widow Pamela for £1million . Today Peter’s widow Pamela has decided to downsize and sell the four-bedroom house that was once a mecca for the glitterati. She has put it on the market for £1 million and will be moving to Oxted in Surrey to be nearer her daughter. Originally, her husband worked as a showbusiness correspondent in America but returned to England in 1965. His Malibu beach house had been the ultimate Hollywood party palace despite appearing small and garage-like from the outside, and Peter decided to recreate this in London. Pamela recalls: ‘We were in love with the idea of walking through a discreet front door into a beautiful, spacious, glamorous house – something unexpected, and almost magical. So we worked with architect Louis Erdi and had the house built for £30,000. Then we began giving parties and intimate dinners for our celebrity friends. So many came here that Peter Sellers once announced, ‘‘A blue plaque should be put up outside the house saying: This is where swinging London really started.” ’ Where they sat: The living room which has been graced by celebrities such as Liz Taylor and Richard Burton and Peter Sellers . Wine and dine: The house was built especially for Peter and Pamela Evans for £30,000 in the Sixties . Space to socialise: The kitchen in the four-bedroom home in Sydenham Hill, south London . Sellers – whose authorised biography The Mask Behind The Mask was written by Evans – was virulently opposed to him moving to South-East London. ‘He tried really hard to talk us out of it and kept saying we should only live in North London,’ Pamela explains. ‘Then he came to see the house, fell in love with it and used to call it “My safe house”. ‘He was paranoid and insisted on a secret phone line being installed. A ‘‘phone expert’’ came to set it up, but it ended up knocking out all the phones in the neighbourhood.’ In those days there were only six houses in the area. Today, given its proximity to Dulwich College and the fact that the journey from Sydenham Hill station to Victoria is only 12 minutes, the neighbourhood has expanded considerably. The 4,000 sq ft cedar-wood house, set in a third of an acre, is surrounded by a white ranch-board fence, behind which is a brick patio. Three stone steps lead to double oak doors that open on to the entrance hall. Guest: Elizabeth Taylor . Another door at the house – a 13th Century Welsh monastery door, which Pamela and Peter used as a headboard – caught the eye of one of their most illustrious visitors, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. ‘She came to our house with Ari soon after their wedding. She told me she loved my old Welsh door. I should have given it to her,’ Pamela says, ‘because it was later stolen.’ From the entrance hall, double doors lead to the vast living room – the site of the celebrity parties – which has maple floors, French windows and a stone fireplace. To the right of the living room is the library, complete with a Turkish carpet from Onassis’s yacht Christina. Onassis, late one evening, turned up with it over his shoulder. The grand piano is a focal point of the living room. Pamela remembers: ‘Dudley Moore often played it. One night, Peter Cook got very drunk and spilled red wine on the carpet, but instantly got salt, threw it on the wine and declared, “Hoover it up in the morning, and the stain will be gone.” It was.’ At the height of their romance, Jean Shrimpton and Terence Stamp played backgammon on the living-room floor. Richard Burton took refuge in the house after many of his fights with Elizabeth Taylor and was once found in the Evanses’ sauna, sleeping off a hangover. Burton adored the garden and once said: ‘Staying here is like waking up in a Manhattan penthouse and then being able to step straight into an English garden.’ Another Hollywood icon to enjoy the garden was Ava Gardner, on whose autobiography Peter collaborated. Before his death last year, Peter remembered: ‘She said it reminded her of New England. But she was becoming increasingly frail, and I was worried about her. ‘She smiled her mysterious smile and said, “If anything bad happens to me, I’ll let you know. I’m a witch and I’ll send you a message.” ‘In 1990 there was a violent storm and an oak in the garden, which Ava had always loved, crashed through the window into my study at the very moment she died. I believe Ava sent me that message, just as she’d promised.’ The property is for sale with pedderproperty.com, 020 8299 0922, and themodernhouse.net,  020 7704 3504.","Four-bedroom home of late writer Peter Evans on sale for £1million .

MPs have ignored warnings that they risk looking lazy and today begin another two-week holiday. The latest break comes just days since the Commons' two and a half week Easter recess. They will return on May 8 for the Queen’s Speech, but only spend eight days in Westminster before heading off again for a 10-day Whitsun get-away. Empty benches: The latest holiday for MPs means they have spent less than half of 2013 so far in the House of Commons . It means that in the first 150 days of 2013, the Commons will have been convened just 64 times. The revelation that MPs have met in the Westminster for less than every other day would appear to contradict assertions from senior ministers including David Cameron and William Hague that Britons must work harder to get the country back on its feet. The latest holiday sparked accusations that the government had run out of ideas and legislation was being rushed through without being properly scrutinised. The frequent holidays means David Cameron and Ed Miliband have gone head-to-head at Prime Minister's Questions just twice in 12 weeks . Earlier this month Margaret Hodge, the . Labour MP who chairs Westminster’s spending watchdog, warned the public . think politicians are lazy and provide poor value for money. 'We are living through the worst . economic crisis in modern times. MPs have a lot to do and yet we are . spending much of our time in recess,’ she said. 'Members of the public would be . forgiven for thinking that it is MPs who are lazy and that it is . Parliament that is failing to provide good value for money. Labour's Margaret Hodge has warned that the public think MPs are lazy . 'We are not spending enough time in Westminster, and this creates a democratic vacuum.' Today the Commons begins a 12-day break triggered by prorogation – the gap between one session of Parliament and the next. Traditionally . Parliament has only broken up for a few days to prepare for the Queen’s . Speech, which sets out new laws planned for the new session. But the long and frequent holidays means . David Cameron has missed several sessions of Prime Minister’s . Questions. There were just two in the last 12 weeks. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance said:  ‘It’s ridiculous that Parliament has shut up shop again when so many of its debates get curtailed by strict timetables and important bills have been rushed through. ‘The amount of time that the Commons spends in recess should be a huge cause for concern as it prevents MPs from properly scrutinising the Government for big chunks of the year. ‘With this latest break so close to the local elections, many taxpayers will be left wondering whether it is more about freeing up time for the politicians go out knocking on doors in support of their political friends rather than getting down to work in their constituencies.’ Labour MP Dave Anderson said: ‘We are going to be on holiday for another two weeks when we could have been discussing really serious things.’ Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, added: ‘The Government has clearly run out of ideas.’","Commons will not sit again until Queen's Speech on May 8 .

Controversial: The portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Dan Llywelyn Hall was unveiled today at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, but it already has its critics . It's a hazard of being one of the most painted women in the  country – artists are always trying to put their stamp on you. But judging by the reaction to this latest portrait of the Queen, the painter should have aimed for a simple likeness. For while Dan Llywelyn Hall describes his work as ‘imposing’ and ‘expressionist’, his crueller critics said it resembled a ‘drag impersonator’ of the Queen or her Spitting Image puppet. The 'Expressionist-style' painting was revealed at the Millennium Stadium - the home of Welsh sport - but was criticised as being a 'hideous cartoon' by the many rugby fans it is there to please. Artist Dan Llywelyn Hall, the youngest person ever to paint the Queen, said he tried to 'get beyond her public image', but the monarch's 133rd portrait has not been warmly received. It comes just months after the Duchess of Cambridge’s first official portrait was unveiled and, art critics were, unusually, largely united in their condemnation, calling it: 'Ghastly ... rotten ... an out and out disaster.’ The Queen's new picture will be permanently housed at Wales's national stadium after being painted by the Cardiff born artist. Hall’s . portraits of First World War veterans Henry Allingham and Harry Patch . were recently displayed at Windsor Castle and are now a permanent . feature in the Royal Collection. This latest portrait was produced . after Hall attended a sitting with the Queen late last year in the White . Drawing Room at Windsor Castle. It is described as “an imposing three-quarter study painted on a 5ft by 4ft canvass in an expressionist style.' But critics have found other ways to describe it. Standing proud: WRU President Dennis Gethin, WRU Chief Executive Roger Lewis, First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones and artist Dan Llywelyn Hall at the unveiling in Cardiff today . Brave face: The Duchess of Cambridge after viewing a new portrait by Paul Emsley of herself at the National Portrait Gallery in central London, which was roundly panned . David Frazier, 38, said: 'I’ve never seen a royal portrait like . that. It is a shocking portrayal - she looks like a caricature of her . Spitting Image puppet.' Martine Thomas, 32, said: “The . Queen can’t be happy with that - it is shocking', and Steve Beauchamp, 24, said: 'It is a real shocker and a disaster.' Diversity: The artist's other subjects include First World War veteran Henry Allingham and Amy Winehouse . Happy: Daniel Hall, 32, is the youngest artist to paint a monarch and the 133rd artist to have sat with her, which he says is about getting beyond her public image . Home of Welsh sport: The portrait will be hung in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff for the fans to see . As he unveiled it, Welsh First Minister Mr Carwyn Jones had only warm words. 'In . commissioning a Welsh artist for this work, and providing a permanent . home at the iconic Millennium Stadium, the WRU are recognising the . important role they play in our culture and showcasing it to the world,' he said. 'This is a fantastic piece which thousands of people visiting the stadium every year will have the chance to enjoy.' Hall, 32, is the 133rd artist to have sat with the Queen. He said the final image is “literally larger than life” - and was “particularly keen to reflect the humanity of his subject.” 'To have been granted a sitting with Queen is an ambition . fulfilled and it has been an enormous privilege to be asked to create . this work. 'As anyone who has ever met Her Majesty will know, it is . simply awe inspiring to be in her presence and I wanted to relay that . feeling as well as showing the very human side to the Queen’s . personality. 'The Millennium Stadium is the pulsing heart of Wales . and is the best possible place to home for the portrait; amongst all the . hopes and dreams of the nation.' Hall graduated from art school in 2003 and has exhibited in the National Portrait, Saatchi and Mall Galleries since. He said: 'It’s a very rare opportunity for any artist to take on, but it can also make or break an artist’s career.' A .

The husband of an Alzheimer's victim has accused social workers of 'kidnapping' his wife, claiming they have banned him from seeing her for the last three years. Brian Entwistle, 73, said he has been refused all access to his wife of 52 years, with police threatening to arrest him on his last attempted visit. He said he has been told a 'safeguard order' has been imposed by social services to protect his wife, Patricia. But despite repeated requests he claims the order has never been produced and he is not even allowed to speak to her on the phone. Brian and Patricia Entwistle pictured together in 2010, the last time Mr Entwistle said he was allowed to see his wife. He claims he has been banned from seeing his wife in a care home for three years . He said: 'My wife is being kept from me - it's as if she's been kidnapped. I don't want to go on another year like this - it is reducing me to a wreck. 'I would like to see her as soon as and as much as I can but I've been put through three years of hell when I've done nothing wrong.' Mr Entwistle, a graphic artist, said he and his wife were happily married for 40 years and raised three children. But around ten years ago he said she began developing Alzheimer's. He said he nursed her at their home on Anglesey for six years until she became too ill, when he agreed that she should move into a care home in Cambridgeshire 250 miles away because it was near her sister and their daughter Mishelle, 53. But during the last three years of caring for her at home he started a relationship with another woman which he describes as his own 'respite' to help him cope. He says this caused a family disagreement and a row with a social worker who was in charge of his wife's care. Mr Entwistle, outside Millfield Lodge Care Home where his wife is living. He claims this is the closest he can get to seeing her . She was moved to the Millfield Lodge home in Cambridgeshire in May 2010 and Brian visited her two weeks later. He said they got on fine and he took a photo of them together. But it was to be the last image he had of his wife, as he was 'never allowed to see her again.' Brian Entwistle and his wife Patricia on their wedding day on 17th December 1960 . Since then Mr Entwistle claims to have found himself barred from visiting, speaking to his wife on the phone or getting any information about her welfare when he rings the home. On his first visit he asked to take her out for the day but apparently was told he wasn't allowed because a 'guard order' had been put on her. He said despite repeated requests from he and his lawyer have repeatedly asked to see it but it has never been produced. He said on his next visit he was not even allowed inside the building - and staff refused to give him any information about his wife. Angry and confused at being barred entry, he went straight to police claiming his wife had been 'kidnapped'. Officers accompanied him to the home, entered it, and came out to tell him she 'was fine'. But they added that he could only discuss the situation with Anglesey Social Services -  who were paying for her care. At the time he could still afford a solicitor but the social services also refused to give the lawyer any details of the 'control order'. Frustrated he made the 500-mile round trip to the home for a third time in September 2010 but was once more turned away. Mr Entwistle has started one-man demonstrations outside the home, holding placards and handing out leaflets about his plight. Police have been repeatedly called to speak to him but he has never been arrested. He has said she has not been allowed to speak to his wife since Christmas 2010 and staff have told him she no longer wants to see him or talk to him. They have now warned him his wife might be moved to a new home because of his 'continued harassment'. He tearfully said: ""How can a man be shut out from his own wife and then accused of harassment? 'We used to have a great relationship with my family but this has torn us apart. 'I can assure you I've done nothing to deserve this. It's quite an horrific story and everyone I know can't believe that this can happen in this day and age. 'I've never done anything to harm my wife in 50 years of living together but now in her hour of need I'm not allowed to see her, or even get any news of her. 'I looked after her for seven years but no-one said I was doing an irresponsible job.' We're now being kept apart for no reason other than they have listened to my daughter who has this issue with me and the social worker on Anglesey who was in cahoots with her.'

Even day-to-day tasks like dealing with bills causes a fifth of Brits to feel anxious and unconfident . In a disturbing glimpse of the country’s mood, it seems a quarter of Britons never feel good about themselves and are riddled by insecurities. New research reveals that the country seriously lacks confidence with our appearance, our ability to parent, and basic tasks like paying bills correctly all causing us anxiety. A survey of 2,033 respondents revealed that for over a quarter, facing themselves in the mirror ranked highest in terms of situations where confidence escaped them, with 33 per cent saying their body is the thing they would most like to change to improve their self-assurance. Other things that left Britons insecure were dealing with bank or utility companies, which left nearly one fifth of adults feeling unconfident, and taking children to the local swimming pool at the weekends (30 per cent). The research also showed that while women battled with confidence more than men (with 10 per cent of more women admitting to never feeling good about themselves, and 15 per cent more with little or no confidence) there is one situation that turns both sexes into nervous wrecks - parental insecurities. A similar number of men and women (21 per cent) face similar concerns when it comes to measuring up against other parents at the school gate and at children's’ parties. Although those with children fared better than childless respondents in terms of feeling good, it was an even playing field when it came to confidence with virtually the same amount admitting to having little or no confidence – in fact, a worrying 35 per cent of parents felt they had none to pass on to their children. The research supports the old adage that we get more confident with age, with those respondents in the 55-and-upwards age bracket citing the here and now as the time they felt their best. Regional differences in confidence were also revealed by the survey, which casts doubt over the perceived self-assurance of the North. Despite living in a city renowned for its party atmosphere, results have shown that the ‘Scouser Smile’ may be all for show, with Liverpudlians having the highest percentage of those who never feel good at 30.8 per cent, closely followed by their Welsh neighbours, Cardiff at 26.8 per cent. Insecurities over parenting abilities is one of the greatest causes of lack of confidence for both men and women with children, though overall they are more confident than childless couples . The ‘Celtic Craic’ must count for something though, with Edinburgh and Belfast ranking low in terms of respondents, with only 12.8 per cent claiming they never feel good. A spokesman for the Transform Cosmetic Surgery Group who conducted the study commented on the findings, saying: ‘The research commissioned has thrown up some pretty shocking statistics with regards to just how low some of us are feeling on a daily basis, and how little confidence we have. ‘Most startling is how a lack of confidence can result in a total inability to complete simple tasks, and undertake every day activities. Sadder still, is the high percentage of respondents who find looking at themselves in the mirror as the biggest blow to confidence.'","Quarter of Brits say facing themselves in the mirror is worst for confidence .

Four teams of architects presented plans Wednesday for a reimagined Penn Station that would be a spacious, welcoming gateway to New York City instead of the crowded, confusing and dark transportation hub now used by hundreds of thousands of daily commuters. The four firms that took part in a design challenge sponsored by The Municipal Art Society all said the only way to improve Penn Station would be to move Madison Square Garden from its current home atop the train station. John Fantillas of H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture said the arena crowds the station 'like three fat men in a rowboat.' Futuristic visions: Four teams of architects have presented plans for a reimagined Penn Station, This is Skidmore, Owings and Merrill's proposed design. Lots of light: This is Diller, Scofidio and Renfro's proposed design for Penn Station, which would let in more light than the current design . Historic station: Train tracks run under the James A. Farley Post Office building, center, before reaching Penn Station, which sits under the familiar circular Madison Square Garden, center back . New look: The new designs aim to revamp and brighten the aging train station . Roger Duffy of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill called Penn Station 'a disaster' and said his firm has imagined 'a magnificent future' for the area with Madison Square Garden moved just to the southwest of its current location. Madison Square Garden called the plans 'pie-in-the-sky drawings.' 'It's curious to see that there are so many ideas on how to tear down a privately owned building that is a thriving New York icon, supports thousands of jobs and is currently completing a $1 billion transformation,' the company said in a statement. The design challenge was prompted by an upcoming vote by New York's City Council on renewing Madison Square Garden's permit to operate on top of Penn Station. The proposal by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) incorporates glass walls and skylights so that even 'from the tracks you know where you are.' Another alternative: SOM aims to move MSG to a spot just south of the Farley Building, on Eighth Avenue between 30th and 31st streets . Madison Square Garden wants the . permit renewed in perpetuity, while the city Planning Commission is . recommending a 15-year limit. The Municipal Art Society and some other . civic groups want the permit renewed for 10 years. In . addition to H3 Hardy and Skidmore, Owings & Merriill, architects of . the under-construction 1 World Trade Center, the firms that presented . new Penn Station designs were Diller Scofidio + Renfro, which has worked . on the High Line and renovating Lincoln Center, and SHoP Architects, . one of the firms that designed the Barclays Center arena in Brooklyn. They offered plans for an airy, light-filled Penn Station with shops, rooftop gardens and other amenities. H3 would upzone plots . all along Seventh Avenue to make way for tall office towers, four of . which would occupy the four corners of the Penn Station site . A three-acre roof garden would sit on top of the station, while all of the train lines would use the multi-layered structure whose centerpiece would be an airy 120-foot-high main hall with skylights . The H3 plan would connect MSG to the rest of the city via an elevated walkway for pedestrians and cyclists called the water line . H3 would upzone plots all along Seventh Avenue to make way for tall office towers, four of which would occupy the four corners of the Penn Station site . New home for MSG: H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture's plan involves relocating Madison Square Garden to a built-out pier along the Hudson River to the west of the Javits Center . Elizabeth Diller of Diller Scofidio + Renfro called her firm's 'city within a city' design 'a large sponge-like mass aerated in many directions.' Some plans envisioned paying for the upgrades by replacing existing buildings in the Penn Station complex with new mixed-use skyscrapers. Madison Square Garden, home to the Knicks, the Rangers and the WNBA's Liberty as well as a venue for concerts and other events, would be moved due west to a pier on the Hudson River under the H3 Hardy plan. The SHoP plan would place it a few blocks to the south and west in the Morgan mail processing facility.

'Penn Station cannot move and the Garden can,' SHoP's Vishaan Chakrabarti said in a phone interview. 'Right now everything's piled on top of everything.' Diller Scofidio + Renfro's plan puts the Garden in the back part of the Farley building directly west of Penn Station. Madison Square Garden said an earlier plan to move the arena to that spot 'collapsed for a number of reasons that did not involve MSG, but did involve many of the same people now pressuring MSG to move, including The Municipal Art Society, which created enormous obstacles to achieving the relocation.' City within a city: Diller Scofidio + Renfro took a more philosophical approach, making much of the idea that a new Penn could be 'a city within a city' Diller Scofidio + Renfro envisions Penn Station as 'a large sponge-like mass, aerated from every angle' With MSG moved to behind the Farley building on Ninth Avenue, there's room for a variety of spaces, from a spa to a micro theater to a cascading park . Inside the station, Diller Scofidio + Renfro envision drifting food vendors carrying their wares around their waist like at a baseball stadium . Also imagined are train arrival and departure times that would be projected onto the floor and real-time video footage of trains approaching and leaving the station aired onto a large screen . Its statement concluded, 'The fact that this exercise does not include anyone who actually has detailed knowledge of this issue or understands the realities of this complex project exposes this exercise for exactly what it is.' The architects said they would hope to work with the owners of the arena to the benefit of all parties. 'Madison Square Garden should not take this study as an affront,' Charles Renfro of Diller Scofidio + Renfro said in interview. 'They should be heartened by the fact that no one wanted to get rid of Madison Square Garden entirely or move it very far from its current home.'","Four teams of architects presented plans Wednesday for the reimagined train station .

While brands everywhere up their prices to cope with the recession, one company has done the opposite. Clothing firm Omgfashion.co.uk has unveiled a 99p dress  - a long black maxi dress with silver detail that is a classic addition to the summer wardrobe. Many will be excited by the budget offering. After all, there's no denying the dress is a bargain. But it would be wise to remember that such cut-price offerings are often clever marketing stunts to increase traffic - and sales - for a site. The average shopper who visits the site to buy the dress will be faced with a £2.95 postage cost on top of the cost of the dress (taking the total to £3.94) - rising to £5.95 for next day delivery. And most will find it hard to resist snapping up another item or two while they are logged on. Bargain: The 99p summer maxi is a long black dress with plunging sweetheart neckline . What better way to make that postage 'worthwhile' than by buying a few more bits and pieces? Still, with the rest of the items . priced reasonably too, this is not going to stretch the purse-strings of . the budget-conscious fashionista too far.

But for the Phipps family the sunshine means they are forced to retreat behind blackout curtains after their neighbour installed solar panels. They say there is so much glare that their home is lit up ‘like a tanning salon’. Robert Phipps says his neighbour's solar panels give off such a glare his family are permanently blinded by the light . Robert Phipps, 51, says the position and angle of his neighbour’s roof means excessive amounts of light are reflected over his garden and into his property. He claims his three-bed detached home is now filled with blinding light. He also fears the dazzle could permanently damage eyes and despite erecting a large fence, the garden is effectively out of bounds when the sun is shining. Mr Phipps, from Torridge, Devon, who lives with his wife Anne, 58, and son Tom, 15, said: ‘There’s this huge wall of light pointing straight at you. It’s worse than looking directly at the sun. I’m really worried it’s causing us retinal damage. ‘It’s not much better inside. We just have to close the curtains and blinds and switch the lights on. Eco-friendly: The offending solar panels which were put up by Travor Chase on his bungalow . Robert Phipps at his house in Devon where his neighbour's solar panels reflect light straight into his house . ‘My son has blackout blinds in his room just so he can escape the glare to do his homework. ‘The conservatory is totally unusable as well. It’s almost like living in a giant tanning salon.’ The panels belong to neighbour Trevor Chase, 81. Mr Phipps said: ‘I’ve invited him over to see the reflection for himself but he wouldn’t come. He thinks we’re whingeing. My problem is with the authorities – they need to do something about this.’ Mr Chase said: ‘We wanted to do our bit to save energy and help the planet. On a good day the panels power the lights and the cooker. ‘On the house in front we can see sets of solar panels and there is glare when the sun catches them, but we don’t mind. We just think, “live and let live”. It happens everywhere.’ But Mr Phipps, a former engineer, who is unable to work because  of long-term health problems, is taking his fight to Communities  and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles. A spokesman for Torridge District Council said the panels were erected under permitted development rights, so planning permission was not required. Heat: Robert Phipps says the reflections caused by the solar panels are making his family's lives a misery . Domestic solar panels became popular with homeowners in 2010 after the introduction of a tax-free Feed-in Tariffs scheme. Households are paid for the energy they produce and use themselves and for the electricity they return to the National Grid. But the payments are far above market rates, requiring heavy subsidies which rose 14-fold last year. The tariff was introduced by Labour leader Ed Milliband when he was environment secretary in Gordon Brown’s government. Earlier this year it was reported his scheme to encourage homeowners to install solar panels and wind turbines is set to cost families an extra £1billion in higher bills. Penny Mills, chairman of the  Torridge branch of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘We believe solar panels should be installed on the roofs of agricultural and industrial buildings, as well as homes where appropriate. ‘However, the planning system should of course ensure there are no resulting problems affecting neighbouring properties.’ View from above: On sunny days light from these solar panels shines straight into the home of Robert Phipps .","Trevor Chase, 81, fitted the panels on top of his bungalow in Devon .

Women could evolve out of having the menopause so that they can have children at a later age, according to scientists. With improved medical treatments for an ageing population, experts say there is no need for the menopause, which only serves to stop older and younger generations competing. Scientist and writer Aarathi Prasad explained that no other animal underwent the process whereby a woman stops ovulating, which in turn making her infertile. Scientists say that in the future women well into their 50s could mother children. They believe that women will either evolve out of the menopause or targeted gene therapies will be developed to treat the condition . She said that the process was abnormal, that there was 'no benefit' to the condition and that women should not have to go through it. The Daily Telegraph reported that older women are becoming increasingly healthy and could be able to have children in their 50s. If experts are correct, pregnancy will one day not only be the preserve of the young . Speaking at the Telegraph Hay Festival, biologist Aarthi Prasad, said that the menopause is something that could be 'overcome' as we evolve. She explained that scientists are . investigating early menopause and looking for a specific gene that . causes the condition. This could eventually lead to gene therapy for all women. She said: 'The mood of scientists working on this and looking into the future is we will either technologically or scientifically evolve out of the menopause. 'It is a health risk and it is a real and inescapable block on reproduction for one half of us - the women, but not the men.'

Murdered: Deborah Levey was found by a colleague at her home in Chichester . A woman suspected of being murdered in her idyllic cottage was a prolific user of dating websites, it has emerged. The body of Debbie Levey, 44, was found slumped in front of the TV by a colleague who called in to give her a lift to work. Police originally believed the divorcee died of natural causes – she had had cancer surgery and was off work until last week. But detectives launched a murder inquiry after uncovering evidence of foul play. A 45-year-old man, believed to be her on-off boyfriend, has been released on bail after being questioned by police on suspicion of murder. Mrs Levey lived with her 16-year-old daughter Jade in £300,000 Cherry Tree Cottage in East Ashling, near Chichester, in the South Downs National Park. The man, from Selsey, West Sussex, was arrested on Monday morning on suspicion of murder and released on conditional police bail until February 21 later the same evening while inquiries continue. Murder squad detectives are working to untangle the complex personal life of the popular twice-married mother and care home manager. Mrs Levey was a regular user of dating websites and friends said she had been in several relationships over the past year. A keen horse rider, she posted online photographs of herself out with friends and answered personal questions in an anonymous singles forum. But it is believed she also met men, including the suspect in custody, who lives in nearby Selsey, through her extensive network of friends. Mrs Levey was discovered dead shortly before 8am on Monday at her semi-detached home of ten years on a quiet country lane. She had suffered no obvious injuries and friends told police the last time she was seen alive was around lunchtime on Sunday. Investigation: A colleague of Deborah Levey (pictured) found her body at her home in Ashling, Chichester . Detective Chief Inspector Ian Pollard, . of the Surrey and Sussex major crime team, said officers became . ‘increasingly suspicious’ after being called in by paramedics. ‘As yet, the cause of her death is . unexplained and we are awaiting the results of a post-mortem . examination,’ he said. ‘Our inquiries lead us to believe that this was . not a natural death and a murder inquiry has been launched.’ Eric Bulbeck, a 77-year-old farmer who . owns the cottage, said Mrs Levey was found by a colleague who let . herself in through an unlocked door.

Tributes were paid today to the talented sportsman who was competing in his first race for Team Herbalife-Leisure Lakes. British . Cycling president Brian Cookson issued a statement following the news, . saying: 'This is a tragedy which will profoundly sadden everyone . associated with cycling in this country. 'My thoughts are with Junior's family and with his friends.' Organisers of the event the Bristol Road Club described the incident as a 'terrible tragedy'. As well as competing for his new team, Mr Heffernan also ran with Plymouth Harriers and swam with Plymouth Leander. Jon . Rudd head coach of Plymouth Leander swimming club said Junior was a . member for just a year but he described him as 'very committed, very . hard working.' He said: 'He wasn't really into triathlons at that time - he was more interested in being a swimmer. 'But I think the triathlon came out of that swimming, it being a third of the discipline. 'He was a very pleasant lad with a very nice family who were exceptionally supportive. It's a massive tragedy - such a shame.' Karen Eccles, chairman of Plymouth Harriers said Junior often ran with the group and had made many friends amongst its runners. She said: 'We saw him as a fellow Harrier because he's always done extremely well for us as a club, winning races. 'There was quite a few people who knew him and the news is quite a shock to us all.I had a couple of calls from members who were really close friends with him and they're really broken up. 'He was very keen and enthusiastic young man and enjoyed whatever he did, running or cycling.' His training partner Plymouth-based triathlete Steve Ferguson added: 'He was such a talented athlete and bike rider. Hearing this news is like having my stomach torn out. 'His dad did everything he could for him to advance in sport. 'He even had a two lane, 50 metre long pool built in their back garden and we would train together.' Mr Heffernan is said to have become a keen sportsman during his time at Kelly College in Tavistock competing for several teams at school. He would often train on Dartmoor and is said to have travelled to Ethiopia to train with some of the world's best runners at altitude. The race is regarded as one of the top races on the early UK cycling calendar. Around 80 riders, some professional, complete 10 laps of the 6.6 mile circuit around South Gloucestershire. Mr Heffernan is said to have been doing well in the race when he was killed. Witnesses say that many of Mr Heffernan's fellow riders were visibly shaken when they returned to the race headquarters following the crash.

"Less than a week later, Alice underwent brain surgery, with consultants able to remove 98 per cent of . the tumour, which proved non-cancerous . By . Emily Payne . PUBLISHED: . 08:16 EST, 28 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:17 EST, 28 May 2013 . A 19-year-old's routine eye test ended up saving her life after optician’s found a tumour the size of an egg attached to her retina was pushing against her brain. Student Alice Walker, from Allestree, Derby, was taken by her father to optician, Phillip Bradley, for a regular check-up after battling nausea and severe headaches for months. After specialists had studied her retina, the light-sensitive nerve layer at the back of her eye, they were stunned at their discovery. A routine eye test carried out at her local opticians showed that one of Alice's retinas was completely swollen and the 'wrong shape' because of a tumour . The back of Alice’s eye was completely swollen and the ‘wrong shape’ which led them to discover a potentially fatal brain tumour last October. Within hours, she was in the Royal Derby Hospital, where she was diagnosed with a rare type of tumour which had grown to the size of a small egg and had been pressing on her brain. Alice said: 'I’d been feeling ill for about six months and had been to the doctors about four or five times. 'I had an eye test in April and everything was normal. But when my dad took me back in October, it was a very different story - we know something was wrong and I was told my retina was swollen. 'Instead of it being concave it was convex and my central vision had become poor. 'I was told that I would be referred. The next day, I was in hospital.' Alice, who had felt ill with headaches and nausea for six months before her diagnosis, underwent a four-hour operation to remove 98 per cent of the tumour, which could have become life-threatening if left untreated . In less than a week, Alice was undergoing brain surgery, with consultants able to remove 98 per cent of the tumour, which proved not cancerous. Her father Robert, 51, who runs a garden centre with wife Karen, 46, said: 'Alice was so young but she coped well. 'When we talked to the consultant, he said she could have [died] at any time. 'This shows why it is a good idea, whatever age, to have a regular eye test.' The 19-year-old faced a gruelling four-hour operation to remove the tumour. Alice (pictured in hospital) discovered that her headaches had been caused by the position of the tumour. It had been pressing on the tubes that drain fluid from her brain . As soon as she arrived at the Royal Derby Hospital, Alice was given steroids to help bring down the dangerous inflammation. Four days later, she travelled to Nottingham’s Queen’s Medical Centre, for intricate brain surgery.Robert said: 'It was a really worrying time for everyone. Post-operation: Alice and her parents later found out that the tumour was non-cancerous . 'We were told that the tumour might be cancerous but it would need to be tested after it was removed. 'The position of the tumour meant it had been pressing on the tubes that drain fluid from the brain. Pressure had been building up and that’s why it had affected Alice’s retina and it can be fatal.' Alice’s news shocked her family, who rallied round to support her and try to pull her through. But as doctors were unable to predict just how much of the tumour needed to be removed, there was a great risk that it could be cancerous and further treatment may be essential. Robert said: 'Alice was brave.The tumour was in the ventricle cavity and was attached to the brain. 'It was unclear just how much could be removed without upsetting anything. 'At the same time, we knew it was Alice’s only hope. 'Alice had been feeling quite unwell for the best part of last year. 'She’d had headaches and episodes of sickness. She was pale and tired and was generally just not herself.' Alice’s mother, Karen, 46, followed their daughter to the Nottingham hospital and stayed with her until the early hours. She said: 'We kept ringing the hospital to find out if she was out of the operating theatre. People die on the operating table - it happens. 'But finally, we got the news that she was in recovery and she was all right. We were told that the tumour had to be tested and we’d have to wait a week for the results. It was another anxious time.

Clampdown: Ireland is to become the second country after Australia to introduce plain pack cigarettes. It is hoped this will stop young smokers, particularly girls, being attracted to smoking. This picture is posed by models . Ireland is to become the second country after Australia to introduce plain pack cigarettes. Health minister James Reilly yesterday announced government approval for his plan to remove the ‘mobile advertisement’ for tobacco firms, ahead of World No Tobacco Day on Friday. Dr Reilly said more than 5,200 people died in Ireland every year from tobacco-related diseases. ‘One in two of all smokers will die from their addiction,’ he said. The Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation welcomed the plan, expected to come into force next year. But the move was criticised by Retailers Against Smuggling, which said it would make it easier for illicit traders to produce black-market cigarettes. Dr Reilly said the initiative will stop big cigarette companies from using marketing tactics like packet size, colour and style to attract young smokers, particularly girls. ‘The introduction of standardised packaging will remove the final way for tobacco companies to promote their deadly product in Ireland. Cigarette packets will no longer be a mobile advertisement for the tobacco industry,’ Dr Reilly said.There are currently about one million smokers in Ireland. The plain packaging plan to combat smoking levels was unanimously agreed by Cabinet, yesterday and is being enacted to make tobacco products look less attractive and make health warnings more prominent. Minister Reilly said as they prepare the legislation there is awareness that  the ‘tobacco industry’  will attempt to use every device at its disposal to try to defeat the plan. Australia was the first country to introduce plain packaging. Minister Reilly said the Australian Government has ‘already beaten’ off every single attempt the tobacco industry made in the courts to defeat plain packaging. He said the industry is now appealing the health initiative to the World Trade Organisation. The plan was broadly welcomed by health groups yesterday but retailers and tobacco giants claimed plain packaging plays into the hands of criminal gangs and tobacco smugglers. Health minister James Reilly, pictured, yesterday announced government approval for his plan to remove the 'mobile advertisement' for tobacco firms . Minister Reilly said: ‘Smoking places an enormous burden of illness and mortality on our society, with over 5,200 people dying every year from tobacco-related diseases. ‘To replace the smokers who quit, the tobacco industry needs to recruit 50 new smokers in Ireland every day just to maintain smoking rates at their current level. The National Federation of Retail Newsagents Ireland President Joe Sweeney claimed the only people who will benefit from the Minister’s announcement will be smugglers and criminals. Mr Sweeney said: ‘I support the government in its efforts to curtail the use of tobacco and alcohol. In doing this though, it must seek to find a balance between regulating harmful but legal, taxed behaviour and driving consumers into the black market to buy illicit products from criminals and subversives whose activities pose an even greater threat to society.’ He added: ‘The Minister for Health is sticking his head in the sand on policies towards the tobacco black market in Ireland which are putting retailers out of business. ‘At a time when at least one in four cigarettes smoked in Ireland is illegal, the Minister’s failure to address the growing criminal fuelled trade in tobacco products shows a breath-taking lack of joined-up thinking.’ Tobacco giant John Player said plain packaging on tobacco merely cuts the supply chain costs for criminals and will have no impact on smoking rates. ‘This decision plays into the hands of the criminal gangs who profit from counterfeit tobacco; their job will be significantly easier now that all tobacco products are intended to be sold in the same generic packaging’ John Player managing director Andrew Meagher said. He added: ‘Ireland is known as a smugglers’ paradise due to our high levels of illicit trade. We expect the situation to worsen considerably as a result of this move, placing further pressures on retailers and government tax revenues.” He said the 2004 smoking ban, the ban on sale of packets of ten cigarettes in 2007 and the 2009 ban on display of cigarettes have not had any impact on smoking levels. Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, Faculty of Public Health Medicine spokesman Dr Fenton Howell said: ‘Plain packaging will stop the tobacco industry from using the pack as a marketing tool to mislead another generation of young people into thinking that smoking is cool and fashionable, when in reality cigarettes makes addicts of our children and condemns them to a life of unnecessary illness and death 10-15 years ahead of time.’","Health minister James Reilly yesterday .

"Dubai sheikh 'appalled' by drugs discovery at top racing stable . Trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni's career is in serious doubt after drugs found .

Bookmakers are offering refunds after 11 horses have tested positive for anabolic steroids at the stable owned by the ruler of Dubai. In one of the biggest ever scandals to hit horse racing, some bookmakers reacted quickly by deciding to refund ante-post bets on the affected Al Zarooni-trained horses. Kate Miller, head of William Hill's PR . team, tweeted: 'Godolphin horses William Hill will refund ALL AP bets . on; 1000 Guineas, Certify & Desert Blossom. 2000 Guineas; . Artigiano/Restraint Of Trade. Top trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni's future is now in doubt after Certify, an unbeaten thoroughbred filly poised to win the 1,000 Guineas race next month, was among those testing positive at the Newmarket stable. Racing scandal: The future of Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni, pictured left, is now in doubt after the discovery of drugs at the stable owned by Dubai ruling Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum . Officials have now banned the horses . from taking part in the race on May 5 in a hugely embarrassing . development for Al Zarooni’s Godolphin stable boss Sheikh Mohammed bin . Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. Al . Zarooni issued a grovelling apology and said he did not know the . practice was against the rules. He now faces a BHA disciplinary hearing. If found guilty he will almost certainly be banned from the sport. The gravity of the situation was reflected in a statement from Godolphin racing manager Simon Crisford. He said: ‘This is a dark day for Godolphin. We are all shocked by what has happened. ‘His Highness Sheik Mohammed was absolutely appalled when he was told and this is completely unacceptable to him. We will await the outcome of the BHA inquiry before taking any further internal action. ‘Sheik Mohammed has instructed me to begin an urgent review of all of our procedures and controls. That is already underway and we will take advice from the BHA in completing it.’ Rocked: 1,000 guineas hope Certify was one of 11 horses to test positive . Scandal: 2012 St Leger winner Encke was trained by Al Zarooni . Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is the Prime Minister and Vice President of the United Arab Emirates. He is also the constitutional monarch of Dubai. The 63-year-old is a major figure in international horse racing and breeding. His passion for horse racing in Britain began in 1981 when he purchased Gainsborough Stud near Newbury in Berkshire. He also owns Ballysheehan Stud in County Tipperary in Ireland and Gainsborough Farms Inc in Kentucky, U.S. His horses have won many leading races in the UK, including some of the classics. In 2008 he bought the Woodlands Stud empire for more than $460 million. His family is estimated to be worth $4 billion (£2.6bn). Al Zarooni and Saeed bin Suroor train for Godolphin in Britain but the former had seemed the favoured trainer with Sheik Mohammed since being handed a role in 2010. Last year he won the Dubai World Cup with Monterosso and the St Leger with Encke. The drugs breaches involve ethylestranol, the substance found in Certify, and stanozolol. Al Zarooni said: ‘I deeply regret what has happened. I have made a catastrophic error. Because the horses involved were not racing at the time, I did not realise that what I was doing was in breach of the rules of racing. ‘I can only apologise for the damage this will cause to Godolphin and to racing generally.’ When jumps trainer Howard Johnson was banned for four years in 2010, one year was a result of positive steroid tests. None of the Al Zarooni horses to test positive can currently run.His stable was subject to a random test on April 9. No date has been set for the hearing. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Lincolnshire-based trainer James Given, who is also a qualified vet, said: 'The number of horses that tested positive shows that it wasn't what one might term an error with a single horse. 'It is, without doubt, a performance-enhancing drug. It's not just active while the drug is in the body - and certainly many of these drugs will persist in the body for several months - but it's the effect on the muscle development beyond its natural capacity.' Apology: Trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni, pictured left, is to face a disciplinary panel hearing after the discovery at the horse racing stables owned by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al Maktoum, right . Also speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, David Mountford, chief executive of the British Equine Veterinary Association, said: 'The rules are fairly clear, and I think most trainers would be aware of those rules. The use of anabolic steroids in training is banned in UK racing. 'It's obviously being taken very seriously by all concerned. And I would expect if, as looks likely, people are found guilty of breaching the rules, they would be treated severely.'","Dubai sheikh 'appalled' by drugs discovery at top racing stable .

The center's chief counsel Jay Sekulow said: 'The IRS and the federal government are not going to get away with this unlawful targeting of conservative groups. 'The lawsuit sends a very powerful message to the IRS and the Obama Administration – including the White House: Americans are not going to be bullied and intimidated by our government.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder on the West Front Lawn of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC . Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the . American Center for Law and Justice, told Fox News host Sean Hannity on . Tuesday night that he would soon be 'taking a lot of depositions in a . very big lawsuit' against the IRS on behalf of 25 right-wing groups. He . revealed on the Hannity show that despite assurances from the Treasury . Department and the White House that the IRS had stopped subjecting tea . party groups to special scrutiny in 2012, his office received a letter . addressed to one of his clients 'on May 6 of this year from the IRS, . asking for responses to intrusive questions.' Sekulow added that the inch-thick . lawsuit, set to be filed Wednesday morning in federal court, will . include 'a series of letters from Lois Lerner herself' - the embattled . chief of the IRS's tax-exempt organizations division who was placed on . administrative leave last week after she refused to testify before . Congress. Those letters, he . suggested, would contradict the claim of former Acting IRS Commissioner . Steven Miller that two 'rogue agents' in the agency's Cincinnati, Ohio . office were behind the politically partisan attacks on conservative . groups which crested during the 2012 presidential election year. Jay Sekulow told conservative TV host Sean Hannity that his group would sue the IRS Wednesday morning on behalf of more than two dozen conservative groups that have tax horror stories to tell . CRUELLA DE (TAX) BILL? Lois Lerner refused to resign after she 'took the fifth' before Congress and is now on administrative leave.

Hannity said he finds the timeline suspicious. 'Lois . Lerner knew about this in June of 2011,'the conservative host said. 'The audit that was done internally by the IRS was finished in May of . 2012. Recalling a former .

Doug Shulman in March of 2012, ""No, we aren't doing this.""' Tea party groups held protests in more than a dozen cities on May 21 to draw attention to their unequal treatment by the Internal Revenue Service . Questions still remain about why U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George conducted only a preliminary 'audit' of the IRS's behavior instead of a full-fledged investigation. Some conservatives see a political motive, even though George has previously served in Republican administrations and under Republican members of Congress . The American Center for Law and Justice's website is ground-zero for the tea party movement's pushback against the IRS . Sekulow insisted that the IRS's approach to dealing with his clients was coordinated 'right out of Washington D.C.' 'That's where it was coming out of.

It is the holy grail that drug manufacturers have clamoured to reach: female Viagra - the cure for a woman's lack of sex drive. Now, experts say one version could be available as soon as 2016 - and it promises to stimulate both body and mind. Emotional Brain, a company based in the U.S. and The Netherlands, is currently developing two drugs for the treatment of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) - otherwise known as a low sex drive. The primary one, called Lybridos, has proved 'effective for women with low sex drive . and motivation as a result of insensitivity to sexual cues', according to the company's website. Around 30% of women suffer from a lack of sexual desire, but experts say a new 'female Viagra' could be on the market within three years . The drug is said to 'increase sexual . motivation and physiological sexual response, such as blood flow to the genitals and lubrication', but also affect the mind. Unlike male Viagra, which deals with the sole mechanics of achieving an erection, Lybridos also targets the areas of brain related to sexual desire. When taken, levels of the brain chemicals serotonin and dopamine are altered, giving dopamine - the area of the brain associated with pleasure and attraction - the advantage, the New York Times Magazine reported. The newspaper reports that both drugs have a mint-flavoured coating which contains the sex hormone testosterone to boost sexual desire. Once this has melted away, the woman swallows the tablet which has a delayed inner-release. But experts say libido is a complex issue and a 'mix of brain, heart and hormones' The pill is said to be a 'close cousin' of Viagra - and, as in men, this enhances blood flow to the genitals, . enhancing sensation. Instead of using the . same ingredients as Viagra, the Lybridos uses buspirone, which was . initially developed as an anti-anxiety medication and works by raising . levels of the hormone serotonin. Combined with testosterone to boost . libido, the researchers believe they have the winning combination of . mind and body stimulation. A lack of libido is a common problem, . with an astonishing 30 per cent of women claiming to have no sex drive . at all, according to the Sexual Advice Association. Lybrido is said to be a 'close cousin' of Viagra - and, as in men, this enhances blood flow to the genitals, enhancing sensation . The experts stress that lack of libido — . the desire for sex — can be caused by a variety of factors, including a . deteriorating relationship with your partner or as the result of a . medical condition or decline in hormones, such as with the menopause. ‘Libido is a complex issue — it’s a mix . of brain, heart and hormones,’ says John Studd, professor of gynaecology . and libido expert based in Wimpole Street, London. However, the ‘problem’ of low libido in women is controversial. Other experts are far from convinced it is a condition requiring medical treatment, arguing the concept has been created by drug companies in order to sell more of their products — and there is nothing intrinsically problematic about not having a high sex drive. Indeed, women interviewed by the New York Times were unable to say exactly why they had lost interest in sex. 'Sometimes I wonder whether it' -  H.S.D.D. - isn't so much about libido as it is about boredom,'  Lori Brotto, a psychologist at the . University of British Columbia who works with patients with clinically . low libidos, told the Times. 'The impact of relationship duration is something that comes up constantly.' However, the researchers on the Lybridos study have admitted that if the drug works too well, the FDA might not approve it or fear of creating 'female excesses, crazed binges of infidelity, [and] societal splintering.' There are fears, apparently, that the researchers are attempting to create 'nymphomania' in women. 'There’s a bias against — a fear of creating the sexually aggressive woman,' Andrew Goldstein, a Washington-based researcher told the paper.","Lybridos' manufacturer says the drug will help women with a low sex drive .

With Stalin's death in 1953, the arts in the Soviet Union gradually became more liberalized but politics in the 1970s restricted expression and artists had to be employed by the state. By the 1980s and the collapse of the Soviet Union, galleries were opened and artists had the freedom to create work to their own tastes or that of their patrons. Forced to go underground: This photograph by Evgeny Raskopov shows the military force of Stalin's army during the 1930s when his communist government took control of artists' unions . Rare glimpse: The collection is the first of its kind, giving a glimpse into ordinary life in the former Soviet Union. The collection includes this photograph by Igor Moukhin who documented Moscow's punk rock movement in the 1980s at underground gigs . Fascinating insight: The photographs are 'very different to the images of the region disseminated through Soviet propaganda,' curator of Contemporary Art CIS, Suad Garayeva said . The ordinary and avant-garde: Photographers from this era worked on the very fringes of official art and culture, exhibiting their works underground in alternative spaces until the 1990s . For sale: The collection of more than 800 pictures will be one sale at Sotheby's on June 5 and includes this photograph of a boy at a piano by Evgeny Mokhorev from 1967 . The works up for auction are . representative of a variety of trends in photography during the final . decades of the Soviet regime yet still reflect some of the avant garde . which the Russians had such an important hand in. Among the most notable works to go . under the hammer is Vladimir Kupriyanov's 16 picture collection In . Memory of Pushkin from 1984. The pictures depict a variety of . stereotypical Russian women juxtaposed with verses taken from the poetry . of Alexander Pushkin. It is expected to fetch between £25,000 and £35,000. Iconic image: This 1965 photo by Antanas Sutkus has graced covers of numerous publications after the Lithuanian photographer was asked to chronicle writer Jean-Paul Sartre's high profile official trip to the country . Daily life: Photographer Aleksandras Macijauskas is one of Lithuania's best-known photographers and travelled to the remotest villages in his country to document daily life including this photo from a series called In the Market . Working 'underground': Estimates for individual lots range from £1,200 to £60,000, the exhibition at London auction house Sotheby’s showcases the work of blue-chip Russian and Baltic artist-photographers .

Bankers will have to give evidence on oath to a six-month Parliamentary inquiry into their behaviour. David Cameron and George Osborne . dismissed calls for a judge-led investigation, like that into the media . by Lord Justice Leveson, insisting a panel of senior MPs and peers could . act more quickly and forensically. The committee will aim to report by . Christmas so its recommendations can be included in a Banking Reform . Bill due early next year. Scroll down for video . Announcement: David Cameron said the probe into Libor fixing would get to the truth quickly rather than a longer Leveson-style inquiry . It will examine the 'culture and . professional standards of the financial services industry' and determine . whether new criminal and civil sanctions are necessary. But the Government's move drew scorn . from Labour, which is to try to force a Commons vote as early as today . on whether a public inquiry should be held instead. Labour sources said they were . considering whether or not to co-operate with the Parliamentary . investigation. If Labour refused to allow its MPs and peers to sit on . the panel, its cross-party credibility would be fatally undermined. The Chancellor told MPs: 'The failure . to regulate the banks in the boom years cost this country billions of . pounds. The behaviour of some in the financial services industry has . damaged the reputation of an industry that employs hundreds of thousands . of people and is vital to the economic prosperity of the country. 'We are changing the failed . regulation, reforming the banks – now it's time to deal with the culture . that flourished in the age of irresponsibility and hold those who . allowed it to flourish to account. 'I don't think a long costly public . inquiry is the right answer. It would take months to set up and years to . report. We know what went wrong. We can't wait until 2015 or 2016 to . fix it. Anger: Ed Miliband called for a full independent inquiry into banking standards . 'Let us have a serious inquiry, but let us have an inquiry that comes to a conclusion within a measurably short period of time, so we can actually amend the law that is going before the House next year.' The committee, which is expected to start work as early as next week, is to be led by Andrew Tyrie, the chairman of the Commons Treasury Select Committee. Senior figures from the House of Lords, such as former Chancellor Lord Lawson, are expected to be invited to sit on the panel, as well as a number of cross-bench peers. Unusually, the committee is expected to question people under oath, including members of both Houses, and powers to summon witnesses or relevant papers. Witnesses are likely to include Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King and his deputy Paul Tucker, former prime minister Gordon Brown and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, who was a Treasury minister when the scandal was taking place. A separate, independent review of the regulation of Libor, the inter-bank lending rate at the centre of the scandal, will also take place and will be headed by Martin Wheatley, the chief of the Financial Conduct Authority. His review will also look at the adequacy of the UK's current civil and criminal sanctioning powers with regards to financial conduct and market abuse. Mr Miliband said the inquiry did not go far enough and demanded a 'full and open inquiry, independent of bankers and independent of politicians'. 'However able or distinguished, politicians investigating bankers will not command the consent of the British people,' he told MPs. 'People are understandably angry about the way banks let them down and I don't believe the proposed way forward is a way we can build the consensus that is required for real change.' Mr Balls said the decision to reject Labour's call for a judge-led public inquiry 'will not do'. 'Just as in phone hacking or the Iraq war, so in banking, only with an independent, forensic and open public inquiry, not politicians investigating bankers, can we re-build trust for the future,' he said. Banking, he added, was a profession which depended on trust, and that trust was 'currently in tatters'. In the Lords, former Labour City minister Lord Myners condemned the 'monstrous' activities of those behind the manipulation of interest rates and questioned the role of trade minister Lord Green, who was chairman of the British Bankers' Association when it took place. The Treasury Select Committee has launched its own investigation into the rate fixing scandal, with Barclays boss Bob Diamond due to give evidence tomorrow. Committee sources said Mr Tucker is likely to be summoned as well as two former chancellors, Alistair Darling and Mr Brown. In another move, Mr Osborne confirmed taxpayers would scoop a windfall worth billions of pounds from fines which are expected to be paid by British banks involved in the manipulation of interest rates. At present, all fines which are levied by the City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, benefit banks, rather than cash-strapped taxpayers. The money is paid to the FSA, which uses the cash to lower the annual levy paid by all its regulated members from banks to small building societies. But yesterday the Chancellor said all fines – backdated from April this year to include the Barclays fine – will be paid into the public purse.","Committee to report by the end of the year so it can influence new banking legislation proposed for 2013 .

Three Filipino girls featured in a U.S. documentary on sex trafficking have helped to convict a Pennsylvania child pornographer who forced them to act out his disturbing sexual fantasies live through the internet. Jeffrey Herschell, 54, of Washington was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison on Tuesday after the brave girls described the horror they were made to endure from the age of eight to a CNN film crew, then to U.S. authorities. 'Whatever the American client wants us to do, we must do it,' 'Gen' told CNN in May 2011 for the documentary 'The Fighters,' which aired earlier this month. Traffickers in Manilas, who are behind the camera, charge men like Herschell around $27 an hour to 'direct' the online streams. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sex slaves: CNN filmed a number of Filipino girls, pictured, in a U.S. documentary about sex trafficking in Manila . Scared: Three girls who spoke with CNN for the documentary, pictured, were 'integral' to catching child pornographer Jeffrey Herschell . The shocking details led Homeland . Security Investigations agents to Herschell's Pennsylvania home in 2011 . where they found computers, cell phones and hard drives containing . dozens of explicit videos and images of children. In January, he pleaded guilty for coercing and enticing a minor and possessing child pornography and was sentenced on Tuesday. One of the investigators told CNN the information the three girls provided him was integral to the case against the America. In the documentary, which was made as part of CNN's Freedom Project over two years, the girls described Americans as 'maniacs,' adding, sharply: 'You need to stop victimizing girls like us.' One of the girls described how men at internet cafes 'tell me to take my clothes off and then they make me dance. I was kind of embarrassed because I'm not used to being naked like that.' According to the disturbing documentary, customers on the other side of the sex chat room paid $27 an hour to tell the girls what to do and the camera man would ensure the girls followed the, often freaky, orders. Raids: The film follows Filipino law enforcement as they conduct raids on brothels in Manila, pictured . The girls told how they were made to . perform sex acts with Westerners coming in off the street and that . sometimes animals were sometimes involved in the abuses that were . streamed. 'Sometimes we had to urinate,' one of the girls said on the program, and her friend added that the urine was mixed with juice as a drink. 'That's what the American client wants. He demands anyone who feels like urinating should do so, but that he wants us to do it in front of the camera,' she recalled. The inquiry into Herschell involved several U.S. agencies, the Philippines national police and the non-profit group Visayan Forum Foundation, which fights modern-day slavery. UNICEF estimates as many as 100,000 children work in the illegal sex trade in the Philippines, obviously leaving them suffering severe trauma. Cecilia Flores-Oebanda, the director of the Visayan Forum Foundation, which cares for rescued girls described to CNN how often girls would wake up in the middle of the night screaming and crying because they are so frightened the trafficker will come again. 'Sometimes one of the kids suddenly gets sick and vomits,' she said. 'Our psychologist said it's because she remembers what these guys on the Internet asked her to do.'","Jeffrey Herschell, 54, of Washington, Pennsylvania, was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison on Tuesday .

Now Prince Harry may find himself  the butt of jokes about baldness as pictures reveal he is rapidly shedding his ginger hair. Experts who studied photographs taken of him during his recent trip to America concluded that Harry appears to have genetic male pattern baldness and predicted he will shed much of his hair before he turns 50. Thinning: Prince Harry is beginning to lose his hair on the crown of his head . Like father like son: Both Prince Philip, Harry's grandfather, and Prince Charles, his father, have lost their hair . Tease: Prince Harry enjoys joking about brother William's hair loss . However, it’s not all bad news for the 28-year-old party lover. He is still doing better in the scalp . stakes than his brother William who is two years older and is expected . to be completely bald before he is 40. Jonny Harris, a hair-loss expert and . managing director of the Belgravia Centre hair clinic, said Harry . appears to have dihydro-testosterone, a type of testosterone that causes . baldness on the head while encouraging the growth of body hair. Mr Harris said: ‘Harry may have very . thin hair by the time he is 50. Prince William will be bald by the time . he is 40, perhaps even by his mid-thirties. Harry is known to make fun of his brother’s hair loss, once joking William was ‘already bald aged 12’. And when the first portrait featuring . both princes was unveiled in 2010 he was convinced his elder brother . ‘got given more hair’. The brothers appear to have inherited their hair loss from their father Prince Charles, 64. He started to lose his hair in his . late thirties, but his brother Prince Edward was, like William, . developing a bald patch in his mid-twenties. Prince Andrew, in contrast, still has a thick head of hair at the age of 53. Catching up: Although William is likely to be completely bald by the age of 40, experts predict Harry will lose his hair by 50 . Hair loss: Experts say the prince appears to have a form of testosterone that causes baldness . Mother's side: Harry takes more after his mother Princess Diana than William so is likely to keep his hair for longer . On Harry’s mother’s side of the family, baldness has again been unpredictable. Earl Spencer, Princess Diana’s . brother and Harry’s uncle, has a full head of hair, but the prince’s . maternal grandfather, the 8th Earl Spencer, lost his hair in middle age. Nadeem Uddin Khan, director of the . Harley Street Hair Clinic, which carried out a hair transplant on Wayne . Rooney, warned Prince Harry to ‘party as much as he wants because it . will all catch up with him’. Trichologists who studied images of Harry, 28, from his recent trip to the United States said he is thinning from the crown. While around 70 per cent of hair loss is thought to be down to genetics, experts say there is an element of 'luck of the draw'. Dr Asim Shahmalak, owner of Crown Clinic in Harley Street, told the newspaper: 'In . the royal family, unfortunately, it is such a strong genetic link with . Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Prince William - Prince Harry is now . following suit.' But Harry's hair loss will be tempered by the genes he inherited from his mother, Princess Diana. 'Harry will lose his hair in the . future, but Harry's genetic pattern is more on his mother's side so he . has got a little bit more time,' Nadeem Uddin Khan, director of the Harley Street Hair Clinic said.

Photos of the Duchess of Cambridge topless and Prince Harry naked would still have been circulated even if strict Press restrictions were in place, said former BBC chairman Michael Grade. Lord Grade, who has also chaired ITV, said the Leveson Inquiry should carefully consider any measures to gag the Press, because ‘unethically obtained’ images could be seen on the internet regardless. Lord Justice Leveson is due to present his report into Press standards next month, after a long inquiry sparked by the phone-hacking scandal. Lord Grade, a member of the Press Complaints Commission, raised the issue of ‘the problem of content regulation in a global digital market’ during a parliamentary debate. He said it was ‘hard to imagine’ a more difficult task than the one Lord Justice Leveson is undertaking, but hoped the end result would be a ‘new, enhanced, self-regulatory body’ codified in law for the first time. Lord Grade said: ‘We have just had two Press controversies involving unethically obtained photographs of members of our Royal Family – Prince Harry in Las Vegas and the Duchess of Cambridge in France – which have vividly highlighted the problem of content regulation in a global digital media market. ‘I doubt it has escaped Lord Justice Leveson’s attention that the photographs of the Duchess were published in countries with regulatory regimes offered as possible solutions for the UK. On this evidence, his menu of available options seems to be shrinking.’ He said pictures of the Duchess were first published in France, ‘the country cited as having the model of strict privacy legislation’, but the rules were ‘ignored’ by an editor who could offset any court penalty with increased circulation revenues. The photographs were then published in Ireland, which Lord Grade said had a system regarded as the possible model for the UK. French magazine Closer first published pictures of the Duchess topless, followed by a number of publications . Sweden and Denmark, which each have the ability to impose stronger punishments on the Press than in Britain, also published the pictures. Lord Grade defended the much-criticised PCC and proposed the creation of a new independent, transparent body with the ‘mandate, resources and powers of investigation to examine systemic issues as they arise’. Those close to David Cameron, who will receive Lord Justice Leveson’s report next month, have suggested he is wary of imposing legislation restricting Press freedoms.","Lord Grade said Leveson should carefully consider measures to gag press .

Parents with pupils at Billericay School in Essex received a letter home this week warning about 'extreme haircuts' inspired by The Only Way is Essex star Joey Essex . An Essex school has been branded 'ridiculous' for banning pupils from class if they have TOWIE style haircuts. Parents with pupils at Billericay School in Essex received a letter home this week warning about 'extreme haircuts' inspired by The Only Way is Essex star Joey Essex. The pompadour style - shaved sides with longer hair slicked back on top - has had a resurgence in recent years with many of the cast of the Essex-based reality show sporting the cut. Other stars who have the popular do include Canadian singer Justin Bieber, footballer David Beckham and rock 'n' roll legend Elvis Presley. But now parents fear their children will have to sacrifice the 'reem' look to avoid being banned from the classroom. One parent, who asked not to be name, said: 'I can understand banning some extreme haircuts but this is just ridiculous. 'This haircut has been about since the 50s and it didn't even shock people then. 'There is nothing extreme about it but I'm not prepared to risk my boy's education over a haircut.' In the letter to parents, headteacher Sue Hammond explained the controversial decision saying: 'Our school uniform policy provides clear guidelines as to those hairstyles which are acceptable in school and those which are not. 'I would ask for your support in refraining from allowing your son to cut his hair into an extreme version of the style as, if he does, he will be unable to attend mainstream lessons until such time as his hair has grown out.' School staff have even spoken to a nearby barbers in Billericay, Essex, to explain anything shorter than a number two on the sides will not be acceptable for their pupils. Headteacher of Billericay School Sue Hammond explained the controversial decision in a letter . John Revell, director of the Billericay Barber Shop, confirmed he had been spoken to but said it was a customer's choice what haircut they would like. He said: 'I'm not prepared to lose customers over it - I would do whatever they ask. 'We've been here 18 years and that's because we do what customers want. 'We do warn the lads now, but if you don't do the cut, there are plenty of other barbers who would.' John Revell, of Billericay Barber Shop, said he is not prepared to lose customers over it . However, Billericay councillor, Phil Turner, deputy leader of Basildon Council, has defended the school's decision saying it is 'not a draconian measure but a plea for pupils to look nice'. He said: 'I understand what the school is saying. 'Some people are taking a bit of a liberty, not everyone, so the school is saying ""can you be sensible about this?"" 'There is a fine line between what is acceptable and what isn't. Other stars who have sported the popular do include singer Justin Bieber and footballer David Beckham . 'Parents may be outraged the school would do this. It's taking a bit of a risk putting a letter out and a bigger risk going to the hairdressers, but it's not unique in asking for some restraint in external appearance. 'I would ask parents to be patient and take on the message that's meant not as a draconian measure, but a plea for pupils to look nice.' Other hairstyles banned under the school's strict uniform policy include extreme colouring, spiking, close-cropped and excessive use of gels or waxes.","Pupils are styling their hair like The Only Way is Essex star Joey Essex .

Ice cream traders say that the green scheme could mean 90 per cent of vans would now be considered 'too old,' adding an expense that would force many out of business. Sheffield City Council’s plan ‘to reduce emissions and improve vehicle standards’ has angered many who say the scheme will hurt small businesses. To become a thing of the past? Ice cream vans could be wiped out after a city council approved an emission-reducing scheme to force vendors to replace their van every five years, which cost £60,000 brand new . Rosita Hunt from Sheffield’s oldest ice cream firm, 138-year-old business Granelli’s said: ‘If a vehicle is roadworthy and up to required standards I see no reason for an age restriction. ‘This change will have a big impact. Replacing vehicles is not cheap and it might send some firms to the wall. ‘We haven’t received a proper explanation for why it is even necessary. If a vehicle is suitable, why change it?” Another ice cream seller, who did not . want to named, said: ‘There is a riot going off between ice cream . companies and the council. ‘The council must have brain freeze to keep coming up with more stupid rules and regulations. Out about in Sheffield: Actress Roxanne Pallett and her new boyfriend Harry Neale enjoyed a trip to an ice cream van in Sheffield last week as the weather heated up . ‘Around 90 per cent of the ice cream . vans on the road in Sheffield are over five-years-old and it costs . thousands of pounds to replace each one. ‘It will drive firms out just as the spring and summer season is getting going.’ Even . Deputy Prime Minister and Hallam MP Nick Clegg weighed into the debate. He said: ‘Labour are going to have cold war on their hands this summer . if they go ahead with plans to take ice cream vans off Sheffield’s . streets. ‘While I would . support efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, this should be done . in a sensible way that doesn’t wipe out small firms.’ 'Cold war': Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said while he supports emission-reducing schemes it needs to be done in a 'sensible way that doesn't wipe out small firms' The five-year-ban is the latest in a list of restrictions to the much-loved ice cream vans. Ice cream van vendors must already ask permission from headteachers to sell ice cream within 1640ft of schools, even in the evenings, holidays and at weekends, and cannot trade from one hour before until one hour after lessons. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) also hit out at the proposals. Andrew Flower, South Yorkshire FSB branch chairman, said: ‘This ban is the most absurd and irrational decision to emanate from the Town Hall for some time. ‘It discriminates massively against one particular sector of free enterprise, setting the bar much higher for ice cream sellers than for people in any other trade or profession. ‘Their day-to-day use on local rounds and the fact they only work eight months of the year means their mileage is generally minimal with little engine wear. ‘It is not unusual for a van to last 20 or more years and still remain serviceable.’ Chris Turner, 60, who set up his business 40 years and has six vehicles said: ‘I have been to renew the annual licences for the vehicles that cost £235 per vehicle. I could only re-licence one because the others are more than five-years-old. ‘You can’t buy new vans overnight, they are specially made and there is a waiting list. I can only say that if this plan goes ahead it won’t stop me working.’ Sheffield Council said it will now review the policy before it comes into force. The council received no responses from traders about the age restriction on vehicles before the decision was made but ice cream sellers argue the new rule was ‘hidden in the small print’. A Sheffield Council spokeswoman said: ‘The licensing committee approved a new policy and as part of this agreed ice cream vehicles must be under five years of age. It is part of the commitment to reduce emissions city-wide. ‘We have now reopened the consultation on this policy as we have since been contacted by traders.’","Sheffield City Council has approved the emissions-reducing scheme .

The revelation has prompted experts to suggest 'money is about to change forever' - and brings closer the concept of a future without notes or coins, where shoppers pay for everything with plastic. More than half of transactions were still paid in cash, but notes and coins made up just £29 in every £100 spent at retailers last year, which is down from £32 in 2011, the British Retail Consortium said. Spending: Notes and coins made up just £29 in every £100 spent at retailers last year, down from £32 in 2011 . Many shoppers have switched from cash to . using debit cards and growing online payment services such as PayPal - . while avoiding credit cards as they try to better manage their tighter . budgets. ‘New ways to pay and new ways to shop are shaping the retail landscape like never before,’ BRC director general Helen Dickinson said. ‘Changing customer preferences are driving the increase in debit card use - they're helping people to manage their money better and are a natural fit for online shopping and self-service checkouts.’ More than 54 per cent of transactions were paid in cash in 2012, but use declined as a proportion both in the number of transactions - down 7 per cent - and money spent, dropping 10 per cent. This is the first time in the BRCC survey's 13 year history that both measures have seen a decline. The average cash transaction size dropped to £9.78 in 2012 - from £10.45 in 2011. Diagrams: These British Retail Consortium graphs show the percentage of turnover by number of transactions for cash, debit cards, non-card payments and credit and charge cards for 2007 to 2012 . ‘It is no longer a sweeping statement to suggest that money is about to change forever,’ Mark Hale of KPMG consultants told City AM. ‘It might not be tomorrow, but the direction is set.’ 'It is no longer a sweeping statement to suggest that money is about to change forever. It might not be tomorrow, but the direction is set' Mark Hale, KPMG . The survey, which covered nearly 10billion retail payments, revealed credit and charge card use was down by 3 per cent as a proportion of transactions. Transactions on debit cards went the other way - up 3 per cent, it revealed. Use of alternative payment methods more than doubled on 2011, the survey said, driven by manufacturers' money-off coupons and the rapid growth of PayPal and other online payments. They now account for 5 per cent of all transactions. The BRC expects to see further growth in non-card payments such as those using mobile phones. It also said that 40 per cent of manned tills can now accept 'tap and go' contactless card payments.

Paying with plastic: The survey, which covered nearly 10billion retail payments, revealed credit and charge card use was down by 3 per cent as a proportion of transactions. Transactions on debit cards were up 3 per cent . A number of retailers said they are . planning to roll this out over the coming year, which would mean that . over half of tills will have the capability for contactless payments to . be made. Almost a third of Britons would choose a smartphone over a wallet when going out if they could only take one item, a survey said. In addition some 83 per cent of respondents in the UK, U.S., Canada, Germany and Australia said they wished they did not have to carry a wallet, the PayPal study revealed today. The research also showed that a quarter of British consumers are frequently unable to pay for goods due to a lack of cash in their wallet. The survey added that banks continue to levy huge charges on retailers for handling card payments. The average cost to a retailer of having . a credit or charge card payment processed was 25 times higher than for . cash - 38p versus 1.5p. ‘Cash is still the most popular way to pay,’ Mrs Dickinson said. ‘But our survey shows how rapidly alternative and emerging methods are gaining ground, with growth more than doubling on the previous year, albeit from a low base. ‘These methods will be the “ones to watch” in the future, and retailers are investing heavily to make sure their customers have choice and convenience in ways to pay, whether in-store, at home or on the move.’","Notes and coins made up just £29 in every £100 spent at retailers in 2012 .

A huge 30-mile block of ice his causing chaos in an Alaskan town as water has been flowing onto the land. The colossal river ice jam, which is when water builds up behind a block of ice, was starting to rotate Wednesday as water finally chewed ice chunks away from the stubborn, frozen mass after most of the residents were forced to flee from the rising water. An aerial survey Wednesday afternoon revealed chunks of ice have broken off at the front of the 30-mile ice jam on the Yukon River, National Weather Service hydrologist Ed Plumb said. That means the jam will move soon and waters will begin to recede in the waterlogged town of Galena, 20 miles upriver. Scroll down for video . 'I've never seen anything like this before,' one official said. 'And I don't think these people here (have) either. The ice jam is amazing.' The ice jam had begun churning Wednesday as water finally chewed ice chunks away from the river . The flooding lifted homes off foundations and has threatened to break a dike protecting the airport, virtually the only dry spot left in the community of 500 where floodwaters washed out roads and submerged homes. There are no reports of injuries. The National Guard flew 32 more people and 19 dogs to Fairbanks Tuesday night. Other residents were evacuated earlier. Kevin Ray, a state worker who moved to Galena four months ago, was among the human evacuees who flew in on a Guard C-130 transport plane to Fairbanks, 270 miles east of Galena. Ray said the flight was noisy, with the constant barking of frightened dogs. In Galena, Ray's office is gone. His apartment and all his possessions are under water. 'So basically, I'm kind of a homeless guy,' Ray, 65, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Wednesday from an American Red Cross shelter set up at a local church. 'I never thought I'd be a victim. But hey, life is life.' The community of 500 had to evacuate after the floods but there have been no reports of injuries . The flooding lifted homes off foundations and has threatened to break a dike protecting the airport, virtually the only dry spot left . Now that the water is trying to push through the jam, conditions could change quickly. When the jam breaks, the downriver community of Koyukuk will be at risk of flooding. In an earlier flight Wednesday, Plumb said, the ice was locked firmly in place, despite 80 degree temperatures. The hot weather is expected to last a couple days before cooling slightly. In Galena, water went over low areas of the dike Tuesday, then the water level fell. With the threat of water topping the dike again, the state took the step of bringing in military aircraft to aid in the evacuations of those who wanted to leave. State emergency spokesman Jeremy Zidek said 76 residents chose to stay in a former Air Force barracks. The water was rising again Wednesday morning close to the edge of the dike, which protects the runway and some buildings including former barracks, then levels fluctuated without rising more, Plumb said. Outside the dike, everything has been hit by flooding, according to Plumb, who has worked for the weather service for 13 years. 'I've never seen anything like this before,' he said. 'And I don't think these people here (have) either. The ice jam is amazing.' The water was rising again Wednesday morning close to the edge of the dike, which protects the runway and some buildings including former barracks, then levels fluctuated without rising more . The damage has left the town without power, fresh water and cell phone reception. When the ice jam knocked out the bridge leading to the airport, evacuees had to be taken there by boat or helicopter, according to Ray, who said the flooding began with a trickle Sunday. In a place where spring flooding is nothing new, many homes are built on stilts, but the fast rising water reached them, too. An ice jam occurs when water builds up behind a blockage of ice. That includes a glacier blocking an unfrozen river, as is happening in Alaska, and a thawing river being blocked by a still-frozen section further on. After the ice dam breaks apart, the sudden surge of water floods areas downstream. The disaster has left people feeling traumatized and vulnerable, Ray said. 'We didn't have any idea how vast the flood was going to be,' he said. Zidek said the damage is being . assessed and a disaster policy cabinet will forward recommendations to . Gov. Sean Parnell, who visited the area Tuesday. Recommendations are likely to include issuing a disaster declaration. Parnell surveyed the damage on Tuesday and had the Alaska National Guard help evacuate the estimated 75 residents still in town. 'We expect the flooding to become worse before the waters start to recede,' Parnell said. 'Ensuring the safety of those impacted by the flooding remains my top priority.'

Assault: Captain Dale Walker admits hitting a policewoman in the face after she caught him urinating in an alley . An Army physiotherapist punched a policewoman in the face after he was caught relieving himself in an alleyway. Captain Dale Walker told the unnamed officer to 'shut up' when she caught him urinating near Charing Cross station in central London. He then thumped the policewoman in the face and ran away but he was later arrested. The officer suffered severe bruising and swelling to her cheek after the attack in the early hours of February 27, 2011. Captain Walker was later given a conditional caution by the Metropolitan Police, ordered to pay £1,000 compensation and write a letter of apology to the policewoman. But he is now facing the Health and Care Professions Council over the incident. He admits the assault but denies his fitness to practice has been impaired. If found guilty he could be struck off as a physiotherapist. Nicola Hill, for the HCPC, said: 'The incident occurred at 02:45 near Charing Cross. 'The police saw the defendant weeing on the wall and said to him ""This is not a toilet"", to which Captain Walker said ""Shut up"". 'As he walked away there was a tussle and he punched the PC with his right fist onto her left cheek. 'He managed to break free and ran away. The police then called for backup and asked for CCTV to identify the man. 'He was picked up with his hood up and hands in his pockets trying to blend into the crowd but was arrested at 02.55. 'He said he did nothing wrong but had been drinking since 2pm in the afternoon.' Captain Walker had been out celebrating with friends at the Comedy Store before trying unsuccessfully to gain entry to some casinos in the West End. Following his arrest he claimed the policewoman, who was small in stature, had grabbed him and he ran away because he was ashamed to be seen relieving himself against a wall. Giving evidence, Captain Walker claimed he was not drunk at the time of the incident. 'I am deeply ashamed of the events of that night,' he said. 'I am embarrassed by what happened and it was completely out of character. I've never done anything like that before. Hearing: Captain Walker faces being struck off as a physiotherapist if his is found guilty of the assault impairing his fitness to practice . 'First of all, I had my back to the person so I could not identify them. I heard her shout 'Oi, oi, oi' and grabbed my right arm as I was walking away. 'I thought I was being attacked so I pulled my arm away and ran away because I had a lot of money on me and my iPhone in my pocket. 'I deeply regret reacting the way I did and should not have been doing what I was doing in the first place. 'I only reacted that way because I felt threatened.' 'I deeply regret reacting the way I did and should not have been doing what I was doing in the first place.' - Captain Dale Walker . Captain Walker received the caution on 11 September 2011 but only reported the matter to the HCPC in April 2012. He said the consequences of his actions have been severe professionally despite receiving full support and backing from his superiors. Captain Walker said: 'I am staying where I am professionally and being monitored very closely. 'Everything I do is checked and it has limited my career. I am not allowed to be deployed to Afghanistan and I have been put in a management role rather than a clinical role.' Captain Walker has been commended in the past for good service to the army and has continued to train while this case has been hanging over him. He told the hearing he has cut down drinking excessively since the incident. He admits two charges that he was issued with a conditional caution for assaulting a police constable and that he had to pay £1,000 compensation and write a letter of apology, but denies a third charge that his fitness to practice has been impaired.

Disgraced: Fire chief William Wyllie, 49, collected a promotion and £70,000 in pay from Cumbria Fire Service as he awaited trial on charges of distributing sexually explicit pictures of children . He protested his innocence, which meant he could legally . claim his full pay throughout his suspension, and even received a pay increase . when he was promoted. However, he dramatically changed his plea to guilty a . day-and-a-half into his trial last month.

Steven King, who was jailed in 2011 for four years for arranging to have sex . with children as young as five. As a result of the King investigation, Wyllie’s . home and car were searched and laptops, mobile phones and sim cards were . seized. He initially denied nine charges relating to distributing . and encouraging the making of indecent images of children. The jury were told Wyllie claimed the material had been sent . by a malicious hacker attempting to ‘get him in trouble’. But on the second day of his trial he admitted three charges . of sending indecent images of children, two offences of sending indecent moving . images of children and one charge of publishing an obscene article. He was sentenced to a three-year community order, which will . involve three years’ supervision and a sex offender treatment programme.

Veteran: Malcolm Norris, 91, pictured on holiday two years ago, was admitted to hospital and died earlier this month. But his family didn't find out he was dead until two days later . The family of a war veteran say that they were denied the chance to say goodbye to him because his care home did not tell them that he was dying in hospital. Malcolm Norris, 91, died from bronchial pneumonia five days after he was admitted to Hull Royal Infirmary earlier this month. But his widow, 85-year-old Jean, daughter Andrea and her husband David Kerslake, were only informed that he had died when a bereavement worker at the hospital contacted Mrs Norris two days afterwards. Care home owners Bupa say that they tried to contact Mrs Norris, who was on holiday in Wales with her daughter and son-in-law when he was admitted, using two contact numbers but were unsuccessful. The family claim that the home also had contact details for Andrea and David Kerslake. Mr Kerslake said: 'I can’t bear to think of him lying on his own with nobody to hold his hand. 'I feel they’ve taken that right away from us, to say goodbye.' Mr Norris, a resident at the Bupa-run Saltshouse Haven care home in Hull, Yorkshire, was admitted to hospital on May 17. Despite his family returning from their holiday the following day, they were still unaware that Mr Norris, who served in the Army for 12 years and fought in Egypt in the Second World War, had been taken from the home when he died on May 22. His widow Jean found out the devastating news last Friday and when she checked her post later the same day had received two letters from Bupa. One offered condolences on Mr Norris's death while the other was a bill for £616.02 for his final weeks in the £800 a month care home. Daughter Andrea, 47, said: 'We took my mother with us to Abergavenny and we informed the care home we would be away. Devastated: Mr Norris's widow Jean only found out that her husband had died when she received a phone call from Hull Royal Infirmary two days later . Grieving: Widow Jean is pictured here with her husband on a family holiday seven years ago . 'If we’d known anything was seriously wrong we would have been there. “We live basically opposite the home - we could have been there in minutes and nobody contacted us at all.' The family claim that Bupa had mobile numbers and landlines for both Andrea and her husband. But Vivienne Birch, deputy regional director of Bupa Care Homes, said: 'The only two contact numbers we had for Mr Norris’s next of kin were for his wife. Tragic: Mr Norris's son-in-law David Kerslake, pictured with Mrs Norris, said that he 'can't bear' to think of the 91-year-old having died in hospital alone . 'When Mr Norris was admitted to hospital, we made a number of attempts to contact Mrs Norris. Unfortunately these calls were either unanswered or the number had been disconnected. 'We understand the hospital made similar attempts to contact Mrs Norris after her husband was admitted and, tragically, it appears these attempts were not successful until after Mr Norris’s death.' She added: 'I would welcome the opportunity to meet Mrs Norris to discuss what happened.

Last week, Jessie, a Border Collie mix, was hit by a train in Denver, Colorado’s light rail fleet. The Light Rail called Denver animal control on Friday to report they’d hit a dog. It wasn’t until Saturday that Jessie was finally spotted. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE BELOW . Recovering: Jessie, a 6-month-old Border Collie mix, is now healing after a train all but amputated her left hind leg last week . She was alive, despite her left hind leg hanging limp and partially amputated from her body. According to a veterinary surgeon, Jessie was saved by the train’s high speed and the heat of tracks. Dr. Brian Van Vechten of the Veterinary Referral Center of Colorado (VRCC) said Jessie’s wound was cauterized by the extreme impact, which allowed her to survive until her rescue. Surgeons at the VRCC had to completely amputate the leg, however. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lucky: Jessie's injuries look gruesome, but veterinarians say the extreme heat and speed of the train that hit her May 17 cauterized her wound and allowed her to live through the night . But, says Van Vechten, Jessie is going to be just fine. ‘Three-legged dogs do really well,’ Dr. Van Vechten told KUSA. ‘She's young. She will adapt quickly to this, and she will still be faster than any of us on three legs.’ Though it has been only a handful of days, footage of Jessie shows a nimble, healthy dog ready to take a bit out of life. Jessie’s owner says the dog had been missing for days prior to the accident. Thriving: Jessie is already active again after she was hit by the Denver light rail (pictured) and veterinary surgeon Brian Van Vechten says 'She's young. She will adapt quickly to this' Major loss: Once Jessie was found, her hind leg was fully amputated, as seen in this x-ray. Vets say she will continue to live a full life . He was reportedly out of town when the accident occurred, having left the dog in the care of a friend, when Jessie escaped. The owner says he’s still looking forward to taking Jessie on camping and hiking trips during the summer. Jessie, meanwhile, could still require more surgery, depending on how her injury heals. Still happy: Jessie escaped while her owner was out of town and someone else was watching her. Now, her owner looks forward to a summer of hiking and camping with his lucky puppy .","6-month-old Jessie was hit by a Denver light rail train last week, but its high speed and the heat of the rails kept the Border Collie mix from bleeding to death overnight ."
"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 18:02 EST, 30 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:03 EST, 30 May 2013 . Lord Carey said 'equal marriages' could open the door for marriages between siblings . A former Archbishop of Canterbury yesterday warned David Cameron that his ‘equal marriage’ reforms open the door for multiple weddings and marriages between siblings. Lord Carey said that same-sex marriage laws amount to a radical and disturbing upheaval which is likely to lead to unintended consequences. Among them he listed the inclusion of polygamous and multiple relationships into the definition of marriage, and the right for two sisters living together to demand a legal wedding. The intervention from Lord Carey, one of the most prominent campaigners against same-sex marriage since the Prime Minister first announced his plan in the autumn of 2011, comes as peers prepare to debate the new marriage law. Ministers are braced for an attempt to wreck the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill next week. A group of MPs have already written to members of the House of Lords urging them to vote down the Bill, on the grounds that in the supposedly free vote in the Commons they were warned by Downing Street that their careers would be at stake if they failed to back it. Lord Carey, 77, said that the Bill overturns the historic understanding of marriage as a platform for a man and a woman to raise children that has lasted since the dawn of Christianity. That, he argued in a paper published by the Civitas think tank, means that the doors will fly open for very different legal versions of marriage in the future. ‘A reason why we should be worried by the redefining of marriage is the unintended consequences of such a step,’ Lord Carey said. ‘Once we let go of the exclusivity of a one-man one-woman relationship with procreation linking the generations, they why stop there? ‘If it is about love and commitment, then it is entirely logical to extend marriage to two sisters bringing up children together. If it is merely about love and commitment, then there is nothing illogical about multiple relationships, such as two women and one man.’ The former Archbishop, who stepped down from Lambeth Palace in 2002, cited the arguments of US academic and lawyer William Eskridge, a prominent advocate of gay marriage rights, who has maintained that it is illogical to limit the number of people in a relationship. Instead he has proposed the scrapping of any laws that limit the numbers or sex of people entering a marriage. Lord Carey was critical of the idea promoted by Home Secretary Theresa May that people who care about each other should have the right to marry. Culture Secretary Maria Miller (right) argued for the reform . Lord Carey said: ‘In no way do I mean to be alarmist about the possibility of this happening in a large scale way, but it is happening in the United States and there is nothing to stop the trend continuing.’ He added that the idea promoted by Home Secretary Theresa May that people who care deeply for each other and want to spend their lives together should have the right to marry is ‘a wholly inadequate understanding of marriage.’ The former Archbishop said: ‘Those of us accused of being on the wrong side of history can only plead with the Government to respect our concern that extending marriage to same-sex couples is not only unwise, but also sets a dangerous precedent.’ Lord Carey’s plea for rejection of same-sex marriage was published alongside a series of arguments both in favour and against the reform published by Civitas in The Meaning of Matrimony: Debating Same-Sex Marriage. Among contributors was Culture Secretary Maria Miller, the minister in charge of piloting the new law through the Commons. Mrs Miller said: ‘Much of the strength of marriage lies in its ability to change with the times. As society has changed, so marriage has changed, and become available to an increasingly broad range of people. ‘In the 21st century marriage is an inclusive - not exclusive - institution. It is available to all adults who are prepared to make vows of life-long fidelity and commitment. Except, that is, if you happen to love someone of the same sex. I believe that simply isn’t right.’","Lord Carey said same-sex marriage laws could open the door for marriages between siblings .

Swedish Mr Andersson made a name for himself through highly commended portraits of singer Amy Winehouse and ex-dictator of Libya Muammar Gaddaffi. He said: ‘My mother had aggressive breast cancer when I was 15, the thought of her having to have a mastectomy really scared me and she was fortunate enough to have surgery without the mastectomy. ‘The recent news about Angelina stirred an anxiety within me leading me to paint this portrait. There is an underlying awkwardness in her demeanour in juxtaposition to the natural beauty of her face.’ The Oscar-winning actress underwent the . surgery after learning he carried the BRCA1 gene mutation that doctors . estimated gave her an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer.

The U.S. Embassy in Norway's capital was evacuated today after a suspected bomb was spotted on one of its official vehicles, just a year after the Breivik massacre. But the discovery – which sparked a full-scale security alert - was actually a training device mistakenly left attached to the car after a U.S. security exercise in Oslo. It triggered a security alert which led to the special forces being deployed and a 550 yard cordon around the embassy, which was evacuated along with other buildings. The evacuation covered buildings within a 500-metre radius of the U.S Embassy, pictured, and included the Royal Palace, though no one from the royal family was there . Police also shut underground rail lines and brought in heavily armed special forces after the fake bomb was spotted during a routine check. It comes just one year after police were criticised for reacting too slowly when gunman Anders Behring Breivik bombed Government buildings in Oslo, before going on a killing rampage. Last month a ten-week trial into the killings concluded, during which Breivik admitted killing 77 people and injuring 242 on July 22 last year, but denied charges of terrorism and premeditated murder. The court heard from the 33-year-old who said he 'acted to stop a Muslim invasion' to 'defend the indigenous Norwegian people'. Th prosecution has asked that he be deemed insane. A decision is expected next month. The 32-year-old Norwegian confessed to setting off the car bomb that killed eight people in downtown Oslo, before gunning down scores of youth from the left-leaning Labour Party . at their annual retreat on an island north-west of the capital. Police have blocked off the area around the castle, pictured, after the discovery of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a training device . The bomb scare comes a year after Government buildings were targeted by Anders Behring Breivik, killing eight people . A . police statement today said: ‘Our bomb squad removed the object and . found that it was a practice bomb which was previously used for an . internal exercise at the embassy,’ The U.S. Embassy declined to comment, but will no doubt face tough questions about how the mistake was able to happen, particularly at a time when memories of last year's shocking attack are still fresh in the memories of Norway's residents. The embassy is planning to relocate due to security reasons to the outskirts of Oslo from its current location adjacent to the royal palace and near the foreign ministry.

Appearing on Entertainment Tonight, the 50-year-old rock star told host Nancy O'Dell that she had caught 'bits and pieces' of Armstrong's confessional interview with Oprah Winfrey last week. During the interview which will air on Tuesday night, Crow says that 'honesty is always the best bet and that the truth will set you free.' Scroll down for video . Spotlight: Sheryl Crow's interview in which she speaks about her former fiance Lance Armstrong's doping confession will air on Tuesday night . Former flame: Armstrong is pictured with Grammy-winning singer Sheryl Crow in this 2005 photo . The Grammy Award winning musician was . in a relationship with the disgraced cyclist from 2003 to 2006, which . coincided with the last two of his tainted seven Tour de France wins. Speaking of his decision to confess . to using performance enhancing drugs last week, Crow said, 'To carry . around a weight like that would be devastating in the long run.' This comes as reports claim that Crow, who famously . dated Armstrong a decade ago, knew all about his . cheating ways. The Grammy . Award winner, was reportedly present when Armstrong asked teammate Frankie Andreu and his wife to retract a statement that they'd heard Armstrong tell a doctor had doped in an Indiana hospital room in 1996. Armstrong started dating Crow in 2003 and the couple were briefly engaged before calling it quits for good in 2006. Accusers: Frankie Andreu, left, and his wife Betsy are pictured with Armstrong in this 1995 image released by the USADA as a part of Betsy Andreu's affidavit, one that accuses Armstrong of lying about doping . Sheryl knew: The singer was previously silent over former fiance's doping scandal . Celebuzz reported that she was twice named in affidavits given to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency by Betsy Andreu that alleged Armstrong had used performance enhancing substances. Crow herself has not spoken about the doping allegations. In an interview last year with Katie Couric, she said: I felt bad. I felt bad for [Armstrong], I felt bad for his family and I kinda felt like the rest of America.' Crow's reps did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She added: 'He is a hero that we watched and looked up to and admired.' Armstrong refrained from mentioning Crow in his landmark admission interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired last week on her OWN network. After the interview aired, Betsy Andreu spoke to CNN and was on the verge of tears as she spoke of her disbelief and disappointment that the disgraced athlete didn't come clean. Support: Armstrong, seen here at the 2005 Tour de France with Crow and his three children from his . first marriage . The disgraced cyclist battled to fight back tears as he talked about son Luke . Armstrong told Oprah that he believes he deserves to be given the opportunity to compete again . She said: 'He owed it to me. You owed it . to me, Lance, and you dropped the ball. After what you’ve done to me . and what you’ve done to my family, and you couldn’t own up to it? Now . we’re supposed to believe you? 'You had one chance at the truth, and . this was it.

By saying he . won't go there is just skirting around the issue. 'This exchange has made me furious. He used to be my friend and he decimated me. I was willing to give him a . chance and this is how he responds? It just doesn't make sense.' Armstrong was close to tears at times when he spoke about the impact of his drug cheating on his family during the second part of his exclusive interview with Oprah Winfrey on Friday night. Winfrey also drew Armstrong out on . his ex-wife, Kristin, whom he claimed knew just enough about both the . doping and lying to ask him to stop. He credited her with making him . promise that his comeback in 2009 would be drug-free. Ex: Winfrey drew Armstrong out on his ex-wife, Kristin, right, whom he claimed knew just enough about both the doping and lying to ask him to stop .

Armstrong has also been romantically linked to fashion designer Tory Burch, whom he dated in 2007, but her knowledge of the cyclist's doping is not known. Speaking about his 13-year-old son . Luke, the oldest of his five children, Armstrong told Oprah: 'I saw my son . defending me and saying, ""That's not true. What you're saying about my . dad is not true.'"" 'That's when I knew I had to tell him.' Critics said Armstrong hadn't been contrite enough in the first half of the interview, but on Friday night he seemed to lose his composure when Winfrey zeroed in on the emotional drama involving his personal life.

My career. Whether I doped or did not dope. I've always denied that and I've always been ruthless and defiant about . that. You guys have seen that. That's probably why you trusted me on . it."" Which makes it even sicker,’ Armstrong said. 'And uh, I told Luke, I said,' and here Armstrong paused for a long time to collect himself, 'I said, ""Don't defend me anymore. Don't.'"" 'If anyone says anything to you, do not defend me. Just say my dad said he was sorry'. 'He said ""look, I love you, you're my dad, this won't change that."" Armstrong said his lowest moment was having to cut ties with his charity which he described as like a 'sixth child' to him . 'Thank God he's more like Kristin (Armstrong's first wife and Luke's mother).' Armstrong also confirmed he has been undergoing therapy to deal with his demons. Armstrong was competing in triathlons, mountain bike events and marathons before he was sanctioned and believes he deserves that opportunity in the future, suggesting a life ban is not right.

Plans to replace face-to-face doctor's surgery appointments with treatment over the phone or via computer weblink will put lives at risk, ministers and campaigners have warned. The new system of 'virtual clinics' favoured by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt could spell the end of traditional doctor's surgeries with appointments conducted on iPads and Skype, and test results delivered by text message. The Sunday Express reported that NHS bosses are importing the idea from India and believe the changes would cut £2.9bn almost immediately, a good chunk of the £20bn the NHS must save to fill its funding gap. However, critics say the plans would create a two-tier health service, where those who are less technologically able - particularly the elderly - would be left behind, and the trust between doctor and patient eroded. The ideas were outlined by health minister Dan Poulter last week and are contained in a Department of Health report called 'Digital First.' It proposes supplying community nurses with iPads in rural areas and making more use of Skype video calling between GPs and patients. Health assessments would be completed online and 'augmented' with video calls. Mobile phone 'apps' would be used by doctors to access lab reports and health records, while negative test results would be sent to patients by text message rather than delivered in person. Health chiefs believe the new system would reduce 'needless' appointments that take up too much staff time. The report says that every one per cent reduction in face-to-face appointments will save the health service £200m. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham labelled the plans 'dangerous', while charities and campaign groups expressed concerns. The Labour shadow minister said: 'Older people who don't have access to the internet will lose out.' Backing the change: Conservative MP Dr Dan Poulter unveiled the plans for a digital future in parliament this week . 'Dangerous': Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham branded the reforms 'dangerous' and said older patients would miss out on the care they needed . 'It also gives the medical professional the chance to recognise health issues that may not be obvious from a distance.' Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: 'The telehealth agenda must be driven by a desire to improve clinical outcomes and patient care, not the government's plans to save £20bn.' Speaking in a Westminster debate last week, Dr Poulter argued that treating patients with modern technology in their own homes would help to free up in-patient beds and reduce waiting times. 'We have to harness and better utilise more modern types of technology such as telehealth and mobile technology to support people better in their own homes and to drive down the cost of care,' he said. Age UK charity director Michelle Mitchell said: 'Many people of all ages still prefer human contact. Dr Poulter told the Mail Online: 'We want to make life easier for patients. By allowing people to access the NHS online, we will help put an end to things like the 8am rush to phone your GP to try and book a medical appointment, and we are using the internet and medical technology to better support people with long term health conditions like diabetes, dementia and heart disease to be better looked after and supported in their own homes and communities. 'However, it is important to stress that patients who are unwell and need to see their GP will still always have quality face-to-face time with them. 'The Government also recognises that not everyone, particularly frail older people, will have easy access to the internet, which is why the momentum for these improvements in care will be locally-led and will involve working closely with charities like Age UK in order to support people and their carers in better accessing medical technology and the internet.'","Many face-to-face appointments would be replaced by phone or weblink treatment .

The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall sat through a 'hairy' mid-air drama today when an in flight emergency forced them to land minutes after take-off. Fifteen minutes out of central London a technical fault forced the royal helicopter to urgently divert to a nearby aerodrome. Charles and Camilla were flying to Wales for a day-long tour to Hay and its popular annual festival of literature. Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall board the Royal helicopter at Kensington Palace moments before the mid-air drama which forced the chopper to emergency land . But minutes after boarding their flight they were urgently diverted to Denham Aerodrome, in Buckinghamshire. The helicopter, believed to be carrying up to seven people, developed a 'technical fault' minutes after take off. 'The pilot carried out a controlled emergency landing after diverting to the airport,' a spokesman for the royal couple said. 'It was quite a hairy experience,' a source close to the palace added. Fifteen minutes out of central London a technical fault forced the royal helicopter to urgently divert to a nearby aerodrome . Charles and Camilla were flying to Wales for a day-long tour to Hay and its popular festival of literature . Despite the unscheduled stop the royal couple transferred to cars and continued on to the market town of Hay-on-Wye by road. They finally arrived close to three hours late but emerged looking relaxed and smiling to be greeted by a crowd of several hundred well-wishers. 'They were unflappable despite what they went through. If anyone else had gone through what they did they would have cancelled their day,' one pensioner, who preferred not to be named, said. Moments after boarding their flight Charles and Camilla were urgently diverted to Denham Aerodrome . Neither Charles nor Camilla alluded to their in-flight drama once they arrived at their destination today. An official investigation into the cause of the technical fault is under way. The lateness of the royal couple's eventual arrival meant that a planned leisurely tour of Hay had to be carried out more quickly. It started as planned with a quick visit to long-established Hay-on-Wye clothes retailer FW Golesworthy & Sons. Ethal Pugh, 84, waiting inside the shop, sat on a chair in front of a shoe display hoping, she said, not to be noticed. Despite the unscheduled stop, the royal couple transferred to cars and continued on to the market town of Hay-on-Wye by road . Connected to the family which runs the shop, she travelled in from the nearby hamlet of Clifford, in England, and spoke with pride of her 10 grandchildren. 'My daughter said ""mum, you must come,"" but I don't want to be a nuisance so I'm sitting here out of the way,' she said. Moments later, she was accosted by the Duchess of Cornwall who, taking her hand and shaking it, said: 'Pleased to meet you.' Unprepared for the fleeting glimpse of royalty, Ms Pugh said: 'I have no idea at all who that was.' After being told that she had just shaken hands with Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, she said: 'It was brief, but memorable.'","Charles and Camilla were flying to literature festival when drama unfolded .

A loose-lipped supplier who hinted that Apple were slowing down production of iPads and iPhones wiped $22billion off the company's market value yesterday. Shares fell below $400 for the first time in a year and a half, following the comments from audio chip supplier Cirrus Logic. The decline means Apple has lost its . position as the world's most valuable publicly traded company to Exxon . Mobil, which has a market capitalisation a few billion dollars above . Apple's $380 billion price tag. Apple shares yesterday fell briefly below $400 - the first time they had been below that level since 2011 . Apple's stock price over the last year: Earlier in the day, it hit $398.11, the lowest level since December 2011 . The stock was down $21.89, or 5.1 . percent, at $404.35 in early afternoon trading, and earlier in the day, . it hit $398.11, the lowest level since December 2011. Late Tuesday, Cirrus Logic, which supplies audio chips for the iPhone and iPad, said sales of a particular chip are slowing down as an unnamed customer moves to a newer component. Cirrus did not name the customer, but Apple accounted for over 90 . percent of its business in the December quarter. Analyst Peter Misek at Jefferies & Co said Cirrus's news suggests a big decline in Apple sales in the April to June period. That supports his view that Apple is unlikely to launch a new iPad Mini in the quarter, and that the next version of the full-size iPad may launch late in the quarter rather than early. 'It is now very clear that Apple's . market share has reached the peak, given that Samsung has taken a big . chunk of it and HTC has had a few nice models since last year,' said Andrew Wang, Chief Investment Officer of Manulife Asset Management in Taiwan. Apple CEO Tim Cook displays the new iPad mini: Questions over the firm's future products led it to lose its position as the world's most valuable publicly traded company to Exxon Mobil . In the last three years, Apple has launched a new iPad in March or April. Some analysts also say Apple cannot sustain its high profit margins as competition in the tablet and smartphone markets forces the company to lower prices. 'This is a tough environment, Apple is in transition between products,' said Michael Yoshikami, a portfolio manager at Destination Wealth . Management, which owns about 50,000 Apple shares. Cirrus's warning 'makes it more likely Apple's not going to surprise on upside.' Apple does not comment on its suppliers' announcements or its product plans. It is set to report results for the January to March quarter on Tuesday. In the past week, analysts had reduced their revenue estimates to $42.53 billion from $42.68 billion, with net profit expected to decline 17 percent to $9.59 billion. The latest decline in the stock comes after a bruising winter for Apple. The company's stock is down 42 percent from its all-time high of $705.07, hit on September 21 when the iPhone 5 went on sale.","Share price fall blamed on rumours that production is being reduced .

"By . Russell Myers . UPDATED: . 08:17 EST, 4 December 2011 . Postmen who accept traditional Christmas tips have been warned they could face bribery charges. Royal Mail bosses have posted guidance on an official website stating that even in the 'season of goodwill', staff should not accept gifts greater than £30. The warnings follow the introduction earlier this year of the Bribery Act, widely described as the most stringent anti-corruption legislation in the world. Bah Humbug! Postmen have been warned not to accept any gifts worth more than £30 without permission from their line manager . The law was initially designed to combat payment of illegal inducements in multi-million-pound business deals – and those who break it face unlimited fines or up to ten years in jail. But the far-reaching law means that vast numbers of public servants and private sector workers could be open to prosecution after receiving even small gifts, commonplace in many businesses. The My Royal Mail website, which is designed for staff, states under the headline Christmas And The Bribery Act: 'It's the season of goodwill. But it's important to be careful about accepting gifts so you don't fall foul of the Bribery Act.' The website makes it clear that tips are still permitted but warns: 'They should never be accepted in return for favours, for example, earlier delivery, enhanced collection etc.' Keep it small: If your Christmas gift to your postman exceeds £30 you could land him in hot water with his bosses . This appears to suggest that postmen who have assisted a householder could be committing a crime by accepting a tip – implying that householders should only offer tips to postmen who have given no special service at all. Yesterday, postmen at Royal Mail's Mount Pleasant sorting office in Clerkenwell, Central London, were angered by the warning. One postman, who asked not to be named, said: 'To say a normal hard-working postman is only taking a few quid at Christmas as a bribe for the rest of the year is crazy.There's never any favouritism – I just do my job and that's it.' 'If I was to tell someone I couldn't accept a tip, they'd think I was mad.' Another said: 'Some postmen get good tips at Christmas, but they've worked hard for years on the same rounds so I don't think there would be many people who would begrudge them that. If I was to tell someone I couldn't take a tip off of them for Christmas, because it could be a corrupt payment, they would probably think I was mad.' The guidelines from the Royal Mail – which employs 170,000 postmen and postwomen who earn an average of £22,000 a year – state that gifts 'may only be given or accepted up to a value of £30; any gifts over £30 must be politely declined'. It adds that hospitality 'may only be given or accepted where there is a business reason. Hospitality less than £25 per head in the course of business meetings is allowed and does not require pre-approval or registration. Hospitality greater than £25 per head requires line manager pre-approval and must be recorded in the Gifts and Hospitality register.' Experts said the impact of the new bribery laws would be widespread as organisations have to demonstrate they have made every effort to prevent corruption. For the first time, companies or organisations can be prosecuted if they have failed to prevent anyone associated with them, including contractors and staff, offering or receiving bribes, even if they were unaware of the offence. Tis the season to... turn down gifts: Royal Mail's warning follows the introduction this year of the Bribery Act, which the company said it takes 'very seriously' Rose Parlane, a senior associate in the anti-corruption team at law firm McGuireWoods, said: 'This is why organisations like the Royal Mail are taking such stringent steps. 'In the past, if the Serious Fraud Office or another prosecutor wanted to prosecute a company, they would have to demonstrate that senior executives were aware of the offence. Now the company does not need to have any knowledge of the offence in order to be found liable.' She said that if a postman was to receive money from a member of the public to ensure they received his post before others, the Royal Mail could be found liable even though it knew nothing about it. Under the law, both those who pay bribes and those who receive them are liable. The amount of money that constitutes a bribe is not specified, so any transaction can theoretically be considered illegal if the intention is to gain an improper advantage. Customers who give postal workers gifts of more than £30 could be drawn into an investigation if there is a complaint that the payment was corrupt. Legal experts say that Royal Mail staff who accept more than £30 could also face internal discipline. Lawyers also said, however, there was a danger that the law could be interpreted too zealously. In one case, a Norfolk parish council asked members of its bowls club to stop giving Christmas gifts to the club's ground staff over fears they could constitute bribery. Although the Ministry of Justice later insisted that such Christmas tips were not bribes, and have said 'reasonable and proportionate' hospitality is allowable, experts said the example showed how much the new legislation could intrude into people's private lives. Lawyers have also raised the question of whether people who tip waiters could be open to charges of bribery. One commented: 'When you tip a waiter generously at a restaurant, are you simply thanking them for the quality of their service? Or is there lurking behind this seemingly innocent everyday transaction a soupçon that future favours might be anticipated?' Tory MP Philip Davies said: 'I have heard lots of concerns about the Bribery Act and how it has unintended consequences. These things can't be what Parliament intended when it passed this law.' The Act follows high-profile cases such as the 2001 collapse of the American energy company Enron and the Serious Fraud Office probe into a £45 billion BAE Systems arms deal with Saudi Arabia, which was controversially dropped in 2006. Multinationals have spent millions of pounds responding to the demands of the new law, but smaller organisations are also issuing advice. Lambeth Council in South London has told staff that even small tokens of thanks from members of the public should be registered, even if the gift was declined. A spokesman for the Royal Mail said: 'As has been the case for many years, postmen and women are able to accept Christmas tips. 'They cannot, however, be accepted in return for favours or preferential treatment. It is entirely up to customers if they wish to give a tip to postmen and women at Christmas and to what value. 'Like all other major companies, we take the Bribery Act very seriously and have a duty to clearly communicate to all of our staff what it means for them.' A spokesman for the Communication Workers Union, which represents postmen, said it appeared the Royal Mail was trying to cover itself by taking a cautious 'belt and braces' approach to the legislation.","Bah Humbug Royal Mail bosses warn staff not to accept gifts greater than £30 after introduction of Bribery Act .

'She is very soft to stroke and she’s a very intelligent, she rules the roost in our house and even gets into bed with us.' 'She has only ever sprayed once when our dog growled at her, but it takes months to recharge the scent glands and it really is the last resort.'

Kendall, who was elected MP for Leicester West in 2010, was astonished . to find her food had disappeared from a fridge shared by dozens of . people in Portcullis House, where most MPs have their offices. The shadow minister for care and . older people wrote a handwritten note admonishing the culprit and . warning others to think twice before leaving their snack unattended.

She is also a member of Labour’s frontbench team, attending the Shadow Cabinet as the Shadow Minister for Care and Older People.

But today Ms Kendall’s office denied she had added the third note. The Labour MP is campaigning in the Corby by-election today, but an aide said she planned to use the fridge again. Elected in 2010, she was quickly promoted to the frontbench by Labour leader Ed Miliband.

It was to be a highlight of their official Diamond Jubilee tour on behalf of the Queen, a trip deep into the heart of Borneo to see one of its last areas of virgin rainforest. In doing so, however, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, whose nine-day tour of Asia and the South Pacific starts today, are being propelled into the first diplomatic row of their fledging royal careers. A week ago the politician ‘hosting’ their visit, the chief minister of Sabah, was implicated by Swiss authorities in a criminal investigation into alleged laundering of $100million (£62million) in profits from illegal logging. Dilemma: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are being propelled into the first diplomatic row of their fledging royal careers . Environmental groups had alleged that Swiss bank UBS handled vast sums for the region’s top politician, Musa Aman. The chief minister has been instrumental in helping to arrange William and Kate’s trip and he is almost certain to welcome them on Friday. Prince William is particularly keen to see the work being done by the Royal Society, of which is a fellow, to protect the precious ecology of the Danum Valley in Sabah, one of the two states that make up the Malaysian portion of Borneo. Mr Musa is a controversial figure in Malaysia, praised by some for slowing deforestation but accused by others of taking ‘kick-backs’ from illegal loggers. He has previously dismissed such claims as a ‘political conspiracy’. Prince William is particularly keen to see the work being done by the Royal Society to protect the precious ecology of the Danum Valley in Sabah (pictured) The issue over Mr Musa is headline news in Malaysia and last week prompted a demonstration outside St James’s Palace calling on the couple to boycott the meeting. UBS is co-operating with investigators, but insists it has operated within the law, which requires it to report any money it suspects comes from criminal origins. Opposition politicians called on the royals to reconsider the meeting. One, Jeffrey Kitingan, said: ‘We urge William and Catherine to avoid meeting Musa as it will give the wrong message to the world.’ St James’s Palace last night said the visit will go ahead but could not confirm if the couple would be meeting Mr Musa. A spokesman said: ‘Their primary reason for wishing to visit Sabah owes itself to the Duke’s interest in conservation.’ The Foreign Office said: ‘We would not seek to pass judgement on the allegations until they have been fully investigated.’","Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are being propelled into the first diplomatic row of their fledging royal careers .

Taking cholesterol-lowering statins every day could more than halve the chances of getting arthritis, according to a new study. Researchers at Keele University carried out the . research on the back of growing evidence that arthritis is not just down to . wear and tear as the body ages  - but also inflammation in the joints. The study of more than 16,000 adults . found that people on the highest doses of statins – 18.5mg or more a day . – had 60 per cent lower osteoarthritis rates than people not taking the . drugs. As well as lowering cholesterol, statins have an anti-inflammatory effect, and are taken by eight million people to ward off strokes or heart attacks. They are also thought to protect against cancer . and Alzheimer’s and ease the symptoms of multiple sclerosis and . protect diabetes sufferers against heart disease. Keele university’s Health Services Research Unit, which is funded by Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, found that people on very low doses seemed to be at higher risk of arthritis than patients not taking statins. The study, Statin Use and Clinical Osteoarthritis in the General Population:A Longitudinal Study, which is published in the Journal of General and Internal Medicine, said the findings suggest the condition may be more closely linked to heart disease than first thought. 'Our work has shown that the risk factors for cardiovascular disease are also associated with osteoarthritis,' said researchers. 'The co-occurrence of osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease is common.' A spokeswoman for Arthritis Research UK . said: 'We welcome this study as it contributes to the idea that osteoarthritis (OA) in not simply wear and tear as we get older, and that in the future drug treatments can offer hope to people with OA.' Research suggests that arthritis may be more closely linked to heart disease than first thought . 'OA is an active disease that includes inflammation and active damage to the joint. 'The concept that OA is caused by the way that our body processes lipids is not proven, but this study provides some intriguing data to suggest that this warrants further work. 'Arthritis Research UK is committed to finding the causes of OA, new therapies for OA as well as treatments, such as pain relief, that help to manage the symptoms of OA. 'For example, we are funding  a trial to investigate whether a drug called hydroxychloroquinone, commonly used to reduce inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, is also effective for people living with OA.' Scientists believe that inflammation plays a larger role in osteoarthritis than first thought. They are investigating whether drugs used in rheumatoid arthritis, which occurs when the immune system attacks the joints, can also help in osteoarthritis. Around 10 million Britons suffer from arthritis. The charity Arthritis Care estimates the number of patients will rise to 17 million in the next 20 years.","Statins are known have an anti-inflammatory effect .

At least, that's what worked for super-slimmer Steven Goodwin who lost 17 stone in just one year after doctors warned him he was just days from death. Goodwin, 39, tipped the scales at 30 stone after years on a diet of takeaways and microwave ready meals - washed down with litres of full fat coke. Steven from Carlton, Nottingham, got so large he could no longer bend over to tie his shoe laces and needed to use two walking sticks to stand up. He became a recluse, not leaving his home for a year and continuing to eat up to 4,000 calories a day. But in October 2011 he was rushed to hospital after collapsing at home where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and severe diabetes. Steven Goodwin shows how he has lost more than half of his body weight in one year . Doctors at the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) in Nottingham told him he was just days from death and must start losing weight immediately. Incredibly, despite being offered a gastric band operation on the NHS Steven refused and began a diet of healthy food and exercise. In just 13 months Steven shed a staggering 17 stones and slimmed down to a trim 12 stone 13lbs - shocking and impressing his doctors. He went from a size 54in waist to a slim 34in - losing more than half his body weight. Steven, who is a carer to his father Raymond, 71, admitted he was shamed into losing weight when he heard paramedics talking about getting firefighters to lift him into an ambulance. He said: 'I had lost the will to live. I'd given up on myself and even when I was told I could die, it didn't really bother me.

A children’s author and illustrator has been awarded £250,000 in compensation seven years after botched laser eye surgery left her with blurred vision. Jan Fearnley, 47, who was shortlisted for a Blue Peter Award for her book Mr Wolf’s Pancakes, went to a private eye clinic to cure her short-sightedness but ended up permanently scarred. In 2007, Dr Haralabos Eleftheriadis, the ophthalmologist who carried out the routine operation, was found guilty of professional misconduct but Mrs Fearnley had to spend a further five years fighting for compensation. 'Nearly destroyed her': Children's author Jan Fearnley (left) has been awarded £250,000 in compensation after a botched laser eye operation by Dr Haralabos Eleftheriadis (right) left her with blurred vision . Yesterday, she said she would return the money ‘in an instant’ if she could reverse years of suffering that ‘nearly destroyed’ her. Mrs Fearnley, who had the procedure at the Ultralase Clinic in Guildford, Surrey, in April 2005, said: ‘The scarring on my eye is something I am aware of every waking hour of every day. Every conscious moment, I am staring through a scar. I wish I could have just one day when I don’t have to worry about my eyes.’ She added: ‘I dread the winter months with the reduced daylight hours. Whenever my eye is tired or particularly blurry, I wonder, “Is this it? Am I going blind?” ’ The Lasik procedure is designed to permanently change the shape of the cornea – the clear covering at the front of the eye. To prepare the eye, very high pressures are applied via a suction ring. A cutting instrument is then used to make a flap in the cornea, before laser energy is applied to remove corneal tissue. Mrs Fearnley told the General Medical Council in 2007 that  Dr Eleftheriadis, of Northwood, North-West London, ‘fumbled’ with the laser equipment before removing it from her eye. He then apologised and said that he could not continue. Highly regarded: Mrs Fearnley's book Mr Wolf's Pancakes was short-listed for a Blue Peter Award . Mrs Fearnley told The Mail on Sunday that Dr Eleftheriadis denied anything was wrong when she questioned her impaired vision. ‘He knew full well I had irreversible scarring and that was the reason my vision was poor, but he chose to lie,’ she said. The GMC ruled Dr Eleftheriadis’s actions were ‘inappropriate, unprofessional and not in Mrs Fearnley’s best interests’. He had incorrectly tried to achieve suction on her left eye more than once, which resulted in a tear to her cornea. However, the GMC did not suspend his registration as a doctor after he agreed to training and supervision. Mrs Fearnley had two operations to correct the damage but still has blurred vision and sees double lines when she reads. In a settlement with Dr Eleftheriadis’s insurers, the author has now been awarded £250,000. Mrs Fearnley said that the  compensation represented five years’ earnings and that it meant she no longer had to worry about losing her home. She continued: ‘I would return it in an instant were I able to return to the day before my surgery was botched. Creating picture books for children is my life. 'When my eye was ruined, I was determined not to stop working, no matter how difficult and uncomfortable the injury made things.’ She explained that she had improvised by working at a much larger scale and experimenting with collage in her works. Mrs Fearnley added: ‘Working this way also helped me to restore my shattered confidence, which was crucial because following the botched operation, every time I questioned my impaired vision, the surgeon told me that I was “mistaken” and that I was “imagining it”. ‘To have someone in a position of trust and power abuse that position in that way is despicable.  It made me question the very things I was seeing, which is  catastrophic for an illustrator. It nearly destroyed me.’ Her lawyer, Geoff Simpson-Scott, of Colemans-ctts, added: ‘Mrs Fearnley felt incredibly let down by the way her complaint was handled. She felt ignored and abandoned. Her only recourse was to bring a compensation claim. The amount fairly represents the significant effects of her injury on her life. However, it can never restore her damaged eyesight.’ Dr Eleftheriadis’s solicitors declined to discuss the case. A spokesman for Ultralase said: ‘We are aware that Mrs Fearnley has been engaged in a civil action with Mr Eleftheriadis but as we were removed from legal proceedings in 2009 we do not have any detail upon which to provide further comment. ‘Duty and quality of care will always remain our key priorities and we sincerely empathise with Mrs Fearnley’s situation.’","Jan Fearnley, 47, went to private clinic to cure her short-sightedness .

A controversial historical site: The Alamo, in San Antonio, Texas, was once a Roman Catholic mission before the famous battle of the Texas War of Independence in 1836 . This marks the second time that Kanye's guerrilla-style promotion campaign has been vetoed by authorities: on Friday, his planned projection onto the Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas, was shut down by local police. To make matters worse for the Clique singer, the very same planned projections were reportedly cancelled due to technical difficulties at both the Central Library and Bush Memorial. 'We were never asked, and we were never told what was going to happen' said Mark Loeffler, spokesperson for the Texas General Land Office, the Alamo’s caretaker. 'It’s sad that people have such little respect for the Alamo.'

Stood up: 500 fans were disappointed when they arrived to see Kanye's New Slave video projected on the historic site but it was shut down immediately . A link on his website directed fans to a screening at a San Antonio Mall and The Alamo. Police moved fans on from the Mall, and also told those gathered at the Alamo there would be no showings. A small number of member of the Texas National Movement gathered to protest the attempt to beam the video on the Alamo’s facade. 'It’s very disrespectful to the people who died here,' TNM member Angie Alexander said. Fans said the projection wouldn’t be disrespectful of the Alamo defenders. 'It’s not vandalism,' Michael Gomez said. 'It’s just an image that’s going to power off and then it’s gone.' No time for smiles: Kanye West was spotted in Malibu on Saturday, where even a delicious restaurant meal apparently failed to cheer the rapper up . Kanye is not the first music personality to stir up controversy at the Alamo. Black Sabbath singer Ozzy Osbourne was arrested in 1982 for urinating on a memorial across the street from the fort while wearing his future wife Sharon's dress. As a result of his antics, Osbourne was banned from San Antonio for 10 years. The Alamo is considered one of America's most historic sites. It was the scene of a pivotal 1836 battle in the Texas Revolution as the state fought the Mexican army. The 13-day assault on the legendary fort was led by Mexican commander Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. Among those who died in the battle were Jim Bowie, creator of the Bowie knife, and legendary frontiersman Davy Crockett. About a month after the bloody siege at the Alamo, Texan troops took on Santa Anna's troops in the Battle of San Jacinto. Easily won for Texas, the battle had many Texan soldiers shouting the battle cry, 'remember the Alamo!' The defense of the Alamo in 1836 by 200 men is immortalized in the film starring John Wayne as Crockett.","More than 500 fans had shown up to watch the projection of Kanye West's new video 'New Slaves' in San Antonio .

But speaking on Fox News Sunday, Dole said that Reagan - who served two terms and became known as 'The Great Communicator' - wouldn’t even stand a chance if he were around today. When asked if he himself could be the modern-day GOP candidate, Dole said: 'I doubt it. And I - Reagan wouldn't have made it. 'Certainly Nixon couldn't have made it, because he had ideas and, we might have made it, but I doubt it.' Asked if he meant it was because they were both too moderate and willing to compromise, Dole said: ‘I just consider myself a Republican, not all this hyphenated stuff. Dying breed: When asked if he himself could be the modern-day GOP candidate, Dole said: 'I doubt it. And I - Reagan wouldn't have made it' ‘I was a mainstream conservative Republican, most people are in that category.’ On the face of it, many of the things that Reagan did would horrify Tea Party Republicans. He bailed out social security to the tune of $165bn and whilst governor of California passed pro-choice legislation, something which would rule him out as a candidate nowadays. Reagan was a former union man having been part of the Screen Actor’s Guild in his Hollywood days before entering politics. Once in the White House he also raised . taxes to deal with a soaring budget deficit - something the Tea Party is . refusing to do today in a similar situation. The old days: Dole pictured with Reagan in 1976, says the Republican Party should just hang a 'closed for repairs' sign until next year . On Fox News, Dole said that the GOP needed to stop being so negative and work out what they stood for. He said: 'I think they ought to put a sign on the national committee doors that says ""closed for repairs"" until New Year’s Day next year. Spend that time going over ideas and positive agendas.' Dole, now 89, lost out to Bill Clinton in the 1996 U.S. election and also served in the House and the Senate representing Kansas for some 40 years. During that time he was Senate Majority Leader and, for two years, chairman of the Republican National Convention.","Dole, a House and Senate Republican who unsuccessfully ran for president in 1996, says Reagan 'wouldn't have made it' in the GOP today .

"PUBLISHED: . 06:20 EST, 17 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:39 EST, 17 May 2013 . Jessica Curphey was rushed to hospital with excruciating pain on her right hand side . A woman who underwent surgery on one of her kidneys was stunned to be told by doctors she had actually had four of them. Jessica Curphey, 20, was rushed to hospital after she developed excruciating pain on her right side. Just weeks earlier, her GP had diagnosed a urine infection, prescribing . her antibiotics. But scans at Surrey's St Helier Hospital revealed what doctors first thought was a 17cm cyst on her right kidney. Then 11 days later, further tests showed Jessica actually had two kidneys on her right side, the second of which was the 'cyst' - and was so damaged it would have to be removed. But during the operation, surgeons discovered yet another kidney, meaning Jessica had four and the 'extremely rare' privilege of having double the amount. After having the damaged kidney removed in June last year, Jessica is now raising money for Kidney Research UK. She said she had a lot to thank her housemate Steph for, who first rushed her to hospital. She said: 'At first I didn't know how to feel because I had been told so many things. 'Now it's quite fun watching how people react when you tell them that you've got an extra kidney. 'I suppose it's weird not knowing what's going on inside your body until something happens. 'The upside of the whole thing is . that I don't get as bad hangovers as my friends, which is perhaps down . to my extra kidneys. Overall I have come out of this as a stronger . person. 'It was a difficult experience but I was looked after and I've come through it the other end and looking forward to the future.' Scans revealed she actually had four kidneys, one of which was so damaged it had to be surgically removed . Consultant urological surgeon Robyn . Webber said: 'Having three kidneys on a single side of the body is . exceptionally rare. There are perhaps fewer than 100 cases described in . textbooks and papers.' Jessica's mother, Alison, 45, raced down to Surrey from Manchester when she heard her daughter had been rushed to hospital. Alison said doctors drained more than 2,000ml of infected fluid from the damaged third kidney - which was unable to drain because it was damaged. She said: 'Jess had never been ill before this. Because this kidney was so badly stretched and damaged by the infection, the consultant urologist informed Jess that the only solution was to have it removed. 'He said he would try to save the lower kidney but prepared her in case both of them had to be removed. 'As . you can imagine there were lots of tears all round but we were just . thankful that they had managed to stop her going into septic shock.' Jessica (right) with her best friend and housemate Steph Moorghen, who she credits with saving her life . After the operation on June 11 Jessica made a full recovery and is looking forward to finding out her degree results. Alison said: 'Jess was placed on the enhanced recovery programme and in true 'Jess fashion' she charmed and delighted everyone with her recovery. 'The nurses called her ""smiler"". Three days after having a major organ removed, she was discharged.'

The social networking site has become one of the must-have accessories for thousands of Amish teens during their Rumspringa years - when they cast off their parents' rules and experiment with technology, popular culture, alcohol and even sex and drugs. Facebook has become a way for Amish teens to meet other Amish, organize parties and brag to their friends about their new 'English' (non-Amish) haircuts, and lifestyle. Scroll down for video . Selfie in a bonnet? The idea of even sitting for a photograph would unsettle most Amish. But teens on Rumspringa post pictures of themselves - just like teens in the modern world . Getting together: Teens use Facebook to date - but usually only other Amish. Rumpsringa is often seen by elders as a time to find a spouse . Strange: The marriage of Amish, cell phones and Facebook made this entirely bizarre post possible. This teen has apparently borrowed his father's horse and buggy to go meet his friends . 'They love the stuff, but they don’t have a lot of experience with it,' Chris Weber, who counsels Amish teens about drug and alcohol abuse, told BuzzFeed. Facebook and smartphones allow many Amish teens to fall into the same patterns of social media use as their non-Amish peers. They post 'selfie' photos, images of their drunken friends at parties and pictures of themselves in non-Amish clothes. For most Amish, even sitting for a photograph is considered prideful and not in keeping with the rules of the community. Social media has also allowed for massive booze-fueled parties. Noah Hershberger, 22, who recently left the Amish, says teens have gotten smart about not posting details about parties on Facebook because they know cops could be reading. New recruit: Facebook has become a ubiquitous feature if Rumspringa for many Amish teens . This Amish teenager shows off his new, modern haircut and sunglasses, as his family's buggy sits in the background . Simple life: Smartphones have allowed for young Amish to share their daily lives - just like teens in the 'English' (non-Amish) world . 'There are a lot of underagers, so they will forward a text message around with the address, time, and whatever of the party,' he told BuzzFeed. Because Facebook allows Amish teens to dramatically widen their social circles. A party that might have attracted a few dozen teens from a few neighboring farm communities now draws hundreds - sometimes from different states. 'We used to have parties, but it was not this easy to find them. Now it doesn’t take long to set it up and 700 kids show up. Everyone is connected, everyone is texting everyone,' Weber said. Sex remains to verboten topic - even on Facebook. Hershberger says teens still look at online pornography and they often troll dating sites like MeetMe.com. However, this is usually not talked about. Group picture: As this picture reveals, some Amish teens choose to adopt modern clothes, while others choose to wear their traditional garb . 'Besties': These bonnet-wearing girls took a group picture together. It's unclear whether the 'duck face' has made it to the Amish community yet . Play hard: This photo depicts a scene closer to a Las Vegas bachelor party - not a group of Amish teens on night out . Rumspringa has been portrayed in popular culture as a hedonistic time of no-holds-barred partying for Amish teens. The rite of passage - usually between age 14 and 16 - allows young Amish to experience the outside world, including technology, and defy the rules of their parents. However, most teens never actually leave home on Rumspringa, and the vast majority decide to join the church and stay with the Amish community when Rumspringa ends. It is true the Amish teens often drink alcohol at parties - usually with their parents' knowledge. Some experiment with sex and illegal drugs. Most Amish boy and girls, though, live at home during Rumpsringa and only party on the weekends. When they do party, it is nearly always with other Amish on Rumspringa. Even with vast new-found freedom, many Amish teens can't bear to stray far from home or from their traditional values. Ironically, Facebook expands the world for most Amish teens - but only opens it enough so they can meet other Amish. Most Amish teens on Rumspringa aren't interested in dating non-Amish or even necessarily socializing with them. Largely, Facebook has became a way for Amish teens to meet other Amish teens. 'It serves [as] an insulating social . network - one more way that Amish youth socialize only with other Amish . youth - rather than a means of expanding Amish social circles,' Steve . Nolt, a professor a Goshen College in Indiana who studies the Amish, . told the Lancaster Sunday News in 2011. Most Amish teens use smartphones - iPhones are the most coveted - because they can be easily charged using solar power strips. Contrary to popular belief, most teens on Rumspringa still live with their parents, meaning it's not feasible to own computers. Despite the very modern obsession . with social networking, photography and meeting people online, there is . one place Amish teens draw the line - video games. The teens who become obsessed with Farmville or Angry Birds are ridiculed. 'They kind of think it is stupid. They are very practical; they think it is childish,' Weber, the Amish counselor, said. Rumspringa, which takes place for . teens between ages 14 and 16 in most Amish communities, is seen as a . time of courtship. However, it is also a time when teens are free of . their parents rules. At the . end of Rumspringa, the teens must choose whether to be Baptized as Amish . as rejoin the community or whether to abandon their families and way of . life for the modern world. Bragging rights: Facebook has allowed Amish teens to gather in the hundreds to gather for booze-fueled parities . Driving no longer requires a horse-drawn buggy for the wealthiest teens on Rumspringa. This guy bought a new Chevy pickup truck . Modern clothes: Teens often buy new sets of clothing to go with their new lifestyle in the modern world . The vast majority of teens choose the Amish life. One Amishman in Lancaster County, . Pennsylvania, said Amish youths have always been curious about trying . new technologies. Facebook is just the latest. 'When automobiles came out, some . Amish rode in automobiles. When Rollerblades became popular, some Amish . Rollerbladed. Most anything that comes along, some Amish kids will pick . it up,' the man told the Lancaster Sunday News. There is some evidence that Facebook has an even wider use among Amish youths than just those teens on Rumspringa. Cell phones have recently come into . use in Amish businesses and some more liberal bishops have allowed their . members to use social media to market their shops and wares. There is no way to cell for certain how many Amish kids are on Facebook, but some church leaders have begun to speak out against the site. 'This is something no proper Amish would endorse. Kids can get themselves in trouble,' a Lancaster County Amishman told the Sunday News. Part of the problem with Facebook and cell phone use among young Amish - whether on Rumspringa or not - is that parents and older leaders in the community have a difficult time fathoming the technology and how it really works.","Facebook and smartphones allow many Amish teens to fall into the same patterns of social media use as their non-Amish peers .

A 33-year-old teacher who had sudden sex urges and slept with one of her students will only serve four months of her 11 year sentence. Despite the prosecution demanding the minimum of a year behind bars, Kathleen Cawthorne, of Virginia, was shown leniency by the judge after she apologized for her actions. The teacher's husband Duncan also said he was standing by his wife after she apologized for having sex with the 17 year old. A court in Virginia was told that Cawthorne had been diagnosed with bipolar and she also had facets of hypersexuality - a sudden increase in sexual urges. Cawthorne had sex with one of her students from the William Campbell Combined school,Rustburg, Virginia, in March 2012. She picked up the teen and drove to a field where they had sex. The pair also exchanged intimate photos of each other before the affair was discovered by school chiefs and Cawthorne arrested. Cawthorne pleaded no contest to one charge of indecent liberties with a child and three counts of electronic solicitation of a minor in January. At the sentencing hearing, Rick McGee, an associate pastor at Hyland Heights Baptist Church, testified that Cawthorne, a member of the church, had expressed 'extreme remorse' for what she had done. Marital support: Cawthorne's husband Duncan has decided to stand by his wife throughout the ordeal (the couple pictured hugging) He said Cawthorne had accepted responsibility for what she did. McGee also said the church community would continue to be supportive of her as she worked on her recovery. Prosecutor Brooke Willse-Gaddy said at the time the crimes were committed, Cawthorne had been 32 years old, nearly twice the age of her victim. She said, as a teacher, Cawthorne was trained in reporting sexual abuse. 'We trust our teachers,' said Willse-Gaddy. She said Cawthorne had violated that trust and asked the judge to exceed the guidelines and give Cawthorne at least a year in jail . Teacher's school: Cawthorne taught at Campbell County school in Virginia (pictured), where she met the male student . Defense attorney Gordon Peters asked that his client receive no time to serve. He said Cawthorne had no prior record and she could no longer teach. Peters said having to register as a sex offender, meant she was 'essentially lepers in this day and age.' Before judge John T Cook ordered her to serve four months Cawthorne apologized to her victim and to his family. She also said she had apologized to the principal at William Campbell Combined School.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:22 EST, 11 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:25 EST, 11 May 2013 . The mother of Ariel Castro's children repeatedly went to authorities with accusations he was beating, abusing and threatening her. But her complaints never reached the point where Castro was imprisoned or triggered additional police investigations. The late Grimilda Figueroa's accusations against Castro began in 1989 and the last came in 2005, three years after he allegedly kidnapped the first of three women and held them in a run-down house in Cleveland. In the first case, he was not sentenced to prison and in the other two Figueroa chose to drop proceedings. Family: Grimilda Figueroa, is shown with two of her children, Ryan, left, and Rosie. Figueroa, who died last year, was the wife of Ariel Castro, accused of kidnapping and holding three women captive for a decade in his Cleveland home. In Custody: Castro was arraigned on four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape to which he pleaded not guilty . The three Castro brothers, from left Onil, Pedro and Ariel, all appeared in court this week on separate charges . Ariel Castro looked down at the ground for nearly the entire proceeding, biting his collar and signing documents with his handcuffed hands. He didn't speak . Domestic abuse experts said victims . in such cases often change their mind because they are afraid, or they . lack knowledge of the legal system. Castro now has been charged with . three counts of raping Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight . and four counts of kidnapping the three women and his daughter born to . Berry while in captivity. An Ohio prosecutor said on Thursday . he intends to charge Castro with murder in connection with the . starvation and abuse of Knight during pregnancies that led to . miscarriages. Figueroa died in April 2012, at the . age of 48, from an accidental overdose of painkiller oxycodone, . according to an Indiana coroner. Her last complaint against Castro, a . 2005 request to the court for an 'order of protection' could have been a . missed opportunity to expose him, domestic abuse experts said. If he had violated the order he could . have been investigated by police and possibly arrested. That could have . been an opportunity to find the women he allegedly held captive, or it . could have made things worse if they had been abandoned without him and . unable to leave the house. Castro, a former school bus driver, showed no reaction during the prosecutor's statement, staring intently at the floor . Figueroa also filed a police report . in 2005 saying Castro had threatened to 'beat your ass' in front of . their daughter, according to the report. A spokeswoman for Cleveland Mayor . Frank Jackson said that police told Figueroa that year to go to the . county prosecutor's office and file a criminal complaint but she did . not. Instead, Figueroa sought a civil . order of protection in county court. In Ohio, a victim can get a civil . order without criminal charges because they believe this will be less . upsetting to the offender, said Anne Murray, director of the domestic . violence and stalking unit for the city of Columbus, which is 140 miles . from Cleveland. Figueroa eventually dropped even that request for a protection order and so the court case was dismissed. 'That breaks my heart,' Murray said. Figueroa had four children with . Castro - Anthony, Arlene, Angie and Emily - and her efforts to protect . herself from him spanned at least 16 years. The first incident was in 1989. Castro pleaded no contest and was given a year of probation after . Figueroa made a domestic violence complaint against him, according to a . Cuyahoga County court document. On December 26, 1993, Castro was arrested after he arrived home drunk and began beating Figueroa, police said. 'I was afraid that he would come home . in this condition so I had already called police,' a police report at . the time quoted Figueroa as telling them. She told police that he had thrown . her to the ground, hit her about the face and head and kicked her, . according to a Cleveland police report. Their 12-year-old son, Anthony, ran out of the house to get help for Figueroa and was pursued by Castro, the report said. When a grand jury considered the . incident, Figueroa said she could not remember the abuse, according to . court documents. The case was dropped. 'She was afraid,' said Chris . Giannini, a former police officer and owner of International . Investigations, a private investigations company, who tried to help . protect Figueroa from Castro. Domestic violence experts say abuse . victims often raise charges and then back down from pursuing them out of . fear or other difficulties with the legal system. 'If they don't have the support and . the knowledge to go through with what they need to do, a lot of victims . stop,' said Linda D. Johanek, chief executive officer of Cleveland's . Domestic Violence & Child Advocacy Center. According to Cuyahoga County court . documents, Figueroa had been granted full custody of her and Castro's . children by 1997. By then, she was in a new relationship with a man . named Fernando Colon, who was a guard at a hospital where she went for . her injures from Castro's beatings, according to Colon. On August 29, 2005, Figueroa went to . court again, seeking an order of protection against Castro. She also . said he had threatened to kill her and her children during the previous . year and had 'abducted' the children. A year before that complaint, two of . the daughters, Emily and Arlene, accused her new partner, Colon, of . sexual abuse, Giannini said. He investigated the case on behalf of . Colon, and believes that Castro manipulated his daughters into accusing . Colon. Figueroa and Colon denied the abuse. Colon was convicted in September 2005 . on five charges of child molestation based on the testimony of the . daughters, and was sentenced to three years of community supervision, . according to court documents. Arlene Castro declined to be . interviewed by Reuters. Emily Castro is in prison serving a 25-year . sentence after being convicted of attempting to murder her baby daughter . in 2007 by slashing her throat. Also in September 2005, authorities tried to serve Castro with a summons to attend a hearing on Figueroa's complaint. 'They went to his house three times . and no one answered,' said Diane Palos, administrative judge for the . domestic relations court in Cleveland. Castro came to the court to get . the summons, she said. Freed: Amanda Berry (center), Gina DeJesus (left) and Michelle Knight (right) were held captive for ten years after being abducting from the street between 2002 and 2004 . The hearing on Figueroa's petition . was held in November 2005. Court records show Castro and Figueroa both . attended the hearing as did Castro's lawyer. Figueroa's lawyer, Robert Ferreri, did not show up, citing a conflict with another case in juvenile court, records show. Ferreri, a former Cuyahoga County . judge, resigned from the practice of law in 2011 as he was facing . discipline, according to the Ohio Supreme Court. His law license had . been suspended twice before in 1999 and 2000. Repeated attempts by Reuters reporters to reach Ferreri by phone or at residences listed for him were unsuccessful. Figueroa decided not to proceed with . the request for a protection order, according to court documents. Her . lawyer advised her that she would be at a severe disadvantage if she . went ahead without him, documents show. The case was dismissed and she . did not exercise her legal right to revive it. 'She feared this man (Castro),' said . Colon, who now is unemployed and on disability. 'This man had her . psychologically under control. Every movement she made, he was aware of. He threatened to kill her and the kids.' Beaten: Grimilda Figueroa, pictured in a family photo, allegedly suffered broken noses, teeth and ribs . House of horrors: In a photograph taken in 2001, suspect Ariel Castro stands with a former girlfriend in front of a padlocked door, which led to the basement where he allegedly kept the girls . Since 2005, victims' advocates have . been added to the justice system in Ohio to guide women through the . hearing without a lawyer, said Alexandria Ruden, senior attorney at the . Legal Aid Society of Cleveland. Another innovation is that in the . past 15 to 20 years the justice system has become more sensitive to the . pressures on battered women, said Mat Heck, prosecuting attorney for . Montgomery County, Ohio, and chairman-elect of the American Bar . Association's criminal justice section. Authorities are now more willing to prosecute domestic violence cases even when the victim does not want to, he said. If Figueroa had gotten the protection . order, it would have been effective for five years. Any violation by . Castro could have been prosecuted as a crime. 'It's possible that had she gotten that order, there could have been follow-up prosecution, absolutely,' Ruden said. Figueroa decided in late 2005 to move . her children to Indiana, according to Giannini and Colon. After she died . last year, her son Anthony Castro, who now lives in Columbus, Ohio, . posted on the funeral home online guest book: 'Dear Mom. You are gone . too soon. But your suffering is over.

A New York EMT is accused of killing his estranged wife by strangling her then setting her home on fire with her in it. The 2008 inferno in Narrowsburg that left Catherine Novak dead was originally written off as a tragic accident. But, last September, Paul Novak's former girlfriend told police that he had confessed to her that he had murdered the mother of his children. Novak, 45, and a fellow EMT, Scott Sherwood, 40, who allegedly helped him follow through with his plot, are now charged with murder and their trial is expected to begin in July. Michelle La France went to Sullivan County police with the information after she found out Novak had been cheating on her last fall. Suspects: Paul Novak, pictured left, and Scott Sherwood, right, are accused of murdering Novak's estranged wife . Soon after, detectives arrested Mr Sherwood, who had worked with Mr Novak for years as a state-certified EMT out of Jamaica Hospital in New York, and he confessed to everything before later recanting it, according to The New York Post. According to court documents obtained by the newspaper, Mr Sherwood told police he drove to Mr Novak and Ms La France's Long Island home on the night Novak died, with the specific purpose of driving Novak upstate so he could kill his wife. He said the men left behind their cell phones and that Mr Novak told him he had mixed up chloroform to make Ms Novak pass out. When he asked why Mr Novak planned to kill his wife, Mr Sherwood recalled him say 'so he wouldn't end up like me,' broke and divorced and forced to 'work 80 hours a week and be miserable.' When they approached the house, Mr . Sherwood said Mr Novak had him roll the car into nearby woods and told . him to wait there as he walked towards the home. He returned an hour . later. Tragic: Mr Novak and a fellow EMT, Scott Sherwood, who allegedly helped him follow through with his plot, are now charged with the murder of Catherine Novak, pictured, and their trial is expected to begin in July . 'Paul . told me in the car that he went into the basement of the house and . disconnected something to make Catherine come down to the basement,' Mr . Sherwood confessed, according to The Post. 'He then attempted to make her pass out with the chloroform, but she resisted. He stated that he had to strangle her when it didn’t work. Paul said that Catherine passed out and then he set the house on fire by breaking a gas line. 'Paul stated that Catherine asked him why he was doing this, and he said that he told her it was for the kids.' Mr Novak is charged with first and second degree murder grand larceny and arson. He is also accused of fraudulently collecting fire and life insurance as the proceeds of murder. Mr Sherwood, who the prosecution say was paid for his help, is charged with second-degree murder. Ms La France, who allegedly had a fractious relationship with Ms Novak, is now the star witness for the prosecution. But the defense is confident a lack of evidence means they have a strong case. Sources for the defense told The Post there is no physical evidence of strangulation and that their client could not have committed the crime in the time frame laid out because it takes at least three hours to travel between Long Island and Narrowsburg. They claim Ms La France is simply a scorned former lover who wants to ruin Mr Novak's life and that the married couple were in the process of amicably resolving their divorce when the devastating fire occurred.","Paul Novak, 45, allegedly covered Catherine Novak's face with chloroform, strangled her until she passed out and then burned her upstate New York house to the ground with her in it in 2008 .

Miami Heat superstar LeBron James gave a touching tribute to one of his biggest fans last night - wearing her name on his sneakers just hours after she lost a grueling six-year battle with cancer. Bella Rodriguez-Torres, 10, loved nothing more than watching the Heat play basketball with her family. But she passed away yesterday after fighting the disease for more than half her young life. Bella was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer at age four, and astounded doctors when she recovered from the illness - something her parents deemed a miracle. But last year, her tumors returned, and, despite putting up another fierce fight, her condition deteriorated and she slipped away peacefully surrounded by family and friends. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

'Bella didn't lose her battle with cancer but instead won the reward of an eternal life,' her mother, Shannah, told CBS4. Bella's parents, Raymond and Shannah, and Bella's younger . sister, Rayna, coined the phrase 'Live Like Bella' during her extensive . and grueling chemotherapy sessions. And at .

The following January, three new tumors were discovered in her abdomen and she had further treatment. But just a month later, four tumors were found in her pelvis and by January 2013, despite undergoing chemotherapy again, doctors found the tumors had grown. The seriousness of her condition led doctors to recommend intensive surgery, and in March, Bella traveled from Miami to Houston to have a 16 hour surgery to remove the tumors, her uterus, her ovaries and to have her entire abdomen washed in hot chemo. Though despite those treatments, Bella's organs began failing. Her kidney and lung functions were greatly affected and her bone marrow was exhausted plus ultrasounds of Bella's lungs showed new disease had appeared on the lining. Tributes: Tributes are piling in for Bella who inspired many with her courage . Hospice: Bella, pictured, had been under hospice care since the beginning of May . At the start of May, her parents made the difficult decision to stop treatment and she entered a hospice. 'There are few words that can describe what it feels like to have to make a decision of this magnitude. While it has been painstaking to decide to no longer fight and now just ensure her comfort, we are at peace,' her mother told CBS4 earlier this month. Through-out her six-year battle, her parents have chronicled her progress, and the high highs and extremely low lows have been followed by thousands around the world.

Sacrifice: Marine Corporal Thomas 'Cotton' Jones, 22, pictured, died in the bloody assault on the Japanese-held island of Peleliu during World War II but his final request was that his high school sweetheart be given his diary . Corporal Thomas 'Cotton' Jones had one 'last life request' before he was killed by a Japanese sniper on a South Pacific island in 1944: Please give my diary to Laura Mae Davis, the girl I love. Davis, 90, did get to read the diary, but not until last month - nearly seven decades later - when she stumbled upon it in a display case at the National World War II Museum. The New Orleans museum is currently holding an exhibit dedicated to the 22-year-old machine gunner - her high school sweetheart - who was one of nearly 2,000 Americans killed in the bloody assault on the Japanese-held island of Peleliu during World War II. 'I didn't have any idea there was a diary in there,' said the Mooresville, Indiana, woman, and the discovery brought her to tears. Laura Mae Davis Burlingame, she married an Army Air Corps man in 1945, had gone to the New Orleans museum on April 24 looking for a display commemorating the young Marine who had been her first love. 'I figured I'd see pictures of him and the fellows he'd served with and articles about where he served,' she said. She was stunned to find her sweetheart's diary - a gift she had given him before he set off to war. The journal's 4-by-7-inch back cover was nearly filled with her photograph. The picture itself was black and white, but the photographer had tinted her cheeks pink and her lips dark red. She had signed it, 'Love, Laurie.' The pair met in the class of '41 at Winslow High School. 'He was a basketball player and I was a cheerleader,' she said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Finally reunited: Laura Mae Davis Burlingame, 90, holds a photo of herself from high school, which she found in the diary Jones dedicated to her almost 70 years ago . Last life request: Jones wrote in his diary: 'If this diary is lost and if it is possible please return it to Miss Laura Mae Davis' but only now has it made it to her . They had dated through high school and went to the prom together. Jones had given her his class ring but they weren't engaged, she said. He made his first diary entry while a private at Camp Elliott in San Diego, a little less than a year before he was killed. He described it as 'my life history of my days in the U.S. Marine Corps ... And most of all my love for Laura Mae for whom my heart is completely filled. So if you all get a chance please return it to her. I (am) writing this as my last life request.' Burlingame said she didn't know why she never got the diary. It apparently went first to a sister of Jones whom she didn't know well, she said. Robert Hunt of Evansville, the nephew who gave Jones' artifacts to the museum in 2001, told her he had received it several years after Jones' death and worried that passing it on to Burlingame might cause problems with her marriage. It wouldn't have, she said: 'My husband and Tommy were good friends.' Exhibit: The diary, which is full of old photographs, is part of an exhibit into the 22-year-old machine gunner who was killed in 1944 . Sweethearts: The pair were not engaged but had dated through high school and went to the prom together. Jones had also given her his class ring . Jones died on September 17, 1944, the third day of the U.S. assault on Peleliu, in Palau. The bloody operation was where U.S. forces learned the Japanese had changed their island defense tactics. Instead of concentrating units on the beaches and finishing with reckless banzai charges, the Japanese holed up in bunkers, trenches, pillboxes and caves, many of them blasted into the island's hills and mountains, that had to be taken one at a time. Jones, nicknamed in high school for his blond hair, was in the 1st Marine Division's L Company, 3rd Battalion. He was among 1,794 Americans killed on Peleliu and nearby islands in a 10-week assault that Marine Major General William Rupertus had predicted would be over in a few days. Another 7,302 Americans were wounded. An estimated 10,900 Japanese were killed; 19 soldiers and sailors became prisoners of war. Another 283 POWs were laborers, mostly Korean. Memories: Davis, now Burlingame, was expecting to see old photos and uniforms, left, at the exhibit but had no idea the diary, pictured left and right, had survived Jones or that it was dedicated to her . Last entry: The 22-year-old's last entry in the diary, written aboard the USS Maui on December 1, 1943, described winning $200 at craps. He had a total of $320, he wrote, and if he were back home 'Laura Mae & I would really have a wonderful Xmas' When Burlingame learned Hunt was collecting mementos for the museum, she said she gave him photographs and Jones' class ring, which she had kept all these years. The museum's curator, Eric Rivet, said it was the first time in his 17 years of museum work that someone found 'themselves mentioned in an artifact in the museum,' and he let Burlingame take a closer look at the diary, using white gloves to protect the old papers from skin oils. He later scanned the pages and mailed copies to her. Burlingame said she was touched by the number of times Jones mentioned getting letters from his parents and her.

The family of an Arizona mother stuck in a Mexico jail on suspicion of drug smuggling have said they are terrified she'll 'be lost' forever inside the country's poorly run prison system as they fight to get her free. This morning, Yanira Maldonado's brother-in-law, Brandon Klippel, said the Mormon mother-of-seven from Phoenix had already been transferred to a different prison without their knowledge, and the family is frightened it'll happen again. 'One of the things the attorney said to us right in the beginning is that once you’re in the federal prison system (in Mexico), they move you around without keeping good records,' he said on the Today show. 'If she's moved and transported around, we may never see our sister again, and that's something that would just be devastating to our family.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Separated: Yanira Maldonado was with her husband Gary, both pictured, when they were stopped in Mexico and accused of smuggling drugs. Mr Maldonado remains in a Mexican prison . Please go to NBC Today for more videos. Klippel spoke out as Maldonado's daughter Anna Soto told NBC's Miguel Almaguer how the whole ordeal feels 'like it's a movie.' 'It's unbelievable,' Soto said. 'I feel like it's a movie, a nightmare. I want to wake up. There's no way to, and I'm like there's no way to escape.' The woman has been moved from Hermosillo to a jail in Nogales, Mexico, just across the border from Arizona. She'd not yet been charged with a crime, and a court hearing is scheduled for today. On Tuesday, witnesses testified to help Maldonado's case. She claims drugs allegedly found beneath her bus seat during a police raid last week were planted there by soldiers, left by a previous passenger, or perhaps were never there at all. A magistrate in Nogales has until 6 p.m. Friday to rule on her case or she will be sent to another facility for what could be several months behind bars.

'Luckily we both speak English and we got to talk a little bit, but I didn't feel comfortable about anything there,' she told Savannah Guthrie, adding that guards stood over her shoulder the entire time. The family has launched a Facebook page in a bid to clear name of the woman who is a naturalized U.S. citizen but was born in Mexico. The U.S. State Department and Arizona Senator Jeff Flake say they are communicating with Mexican authorities and the Maldonado family. 'She's scared,' said Klippel, who told Today he spoke with her by phone. 'She's in a prison that's got horrible conditions. She's not very happy at all about the situation as you can imagine, but she's very hopeful.' The family claimed earlier this week that Maldonado was thrown in prison for smuggling marijuana after her family failed to bribe a judge soon enough. 'Innocent': The Maldonados, who are Mormon, said they do not even drink and have never taken drugs . Family: The couple, who have seven children between them, said they believe justice will prevail . Maldonado was returning home with her . husband after attending her aunt's funeral in Mexico when their bus was . stopped and police claimed drugs had been found beneath her seat. When she was hauled into a prison, an . attorney told her husband Gary to raise money to give to a judge . because 'that's how it works here', her family said. But . when the couple, who have seven children and two grandchildren between . them, scraped together $5,000 for her release, they still refused to . free her. Her . family is now seeking the help of their state Senator and hoping to . raise awareness of her plight, praying it will lead to her release. They claim that the Mormon mother, who does not drink or take drugs, is innocent. Maldonado . and her husband were returning to Phoenix from her aunt's funeral when . their bus was stopped at a military checkpoint near Hermosillo. When the federales . searched the bus, they claimed they found drugs under a seat where the . couple - the only Americans onboard - had been sitting. 'Bribes': The couple were told they could pay off the judge because 'that's how things work here' They initially charged Mr Maldonado but then let him go before charging his wife instead. 'Never in our lives deal with drugs or do drugs,' Mr Maldonado told Fox 10. 'Everybody from the very beginning was telling us, ""We know you guys aren't guilty, but this is just the process"".' He called it 'the most frightening . feeling you could ever imagine', adding that fellow passengers saw them . board the bus without packages, so he is hopeful that justice with . prevail. A Mexican attorney told the couple to raise cash, Mrs Maldonado's brother-in-law Brandon Klippel told CBS 5. 'His . attorney had talked to the prosecuting attorney there and came back . to him and said, ""You know how it works in Mexico, right?""' Klippel . said. 'He said, ""No I don't."" The attorney said, ""Well, if we . bribe the judge – then he'll let you go"".' But when they took the money to them, they were told it was no longer about the money. A couple of days after her arrest, she was transferred to a women's jail in Nogales, but the family was not informed. When her husband went to visit her, he was told she had been sent elsewhere. 'He panicked,' his brother, Klippel, . said. 'He told me terror struck him. And he thought, for that period of . time, that he'd never see his wife again.' Stopped: The couple were returning from a funeral when they were stopped at a checkpoint (file picture) But on Saturday, he tracked her down to the holding cell and visited with one of their sons. 'She had a rough night,' Klippel said. 'Their interrogation included putting her in a non-air-conditioned room . and waking her up several times in the middle of night – trying to get . her to sign documents that she said she couldn't read.' Family members said Mrs Maldonado had started crying during the visit, but said that she had faith others would help. Senator Jeff Flake's office said he is personally monitoring the situation and has spoken with the deputy Mexican ambassador. Yanira Maldonado has an attorney and will appear at a hearing in front of a judge on Monday. 'In Mexico, I guess you're guilty until proven innocent,' said Klippel.

Happy find: The terrifying storm unearthed an old purse that was stolen from Kellye Cloud, pictured, at Wallmart four years ago. In it was a cell phone with precious text messages from her husband, Frank . Precious: Frank, pictured right with Kellye, died of cancer in 2008, weeks before the purse was stolen. These pictures were not found in the purse . The mother was shocked when she received a call this weekend that her lost purse and cell had been found in the tornado debris near Little Axe, Oklahoma. '(The person who found it) went on to tell me ""we tried to call you and we were looking through the wallet and everything was outdated by two years."" I said ""that's because it's been missing for four,""' Cloud told News 9 Oklahoma. Almost everything was still inside the purse, from hand lotion and lipstick to her social security card and family photos, though her checkbook was gone. Debris: Cloud received a call from a stranger this weekend to say her purse, pictured, had been found in the tornado wreckage . Sad: The phone, which miraculously turned on, still contained messages from Frank, including the one pictured . But the cell phone was by far the most treasured find. 'I was devastated, absolutely devastated (when it was taken),' she said. Miraculously, the old Samsung flip phone had enough power to turn on, and she was overcome to find those last messages from her husband still there. The Kellye and Frank married in May 2008, and it wasn't long after that Frank was diagnosed with cancer. Some text messages from the Vietnam veteran-turned-trucker are more poignant than others, Cloud admitted Cloud. Still there: Everything was still inside the purse but her chequebook . Thrilled: Cloud, pictured, said she was elated to have her old purse back . 'Get diet Coke,' read one, which made her laugh. 'He sent me one saying XO, which is hugs and kisses,' she said. Cloud explained that reading through the text messages even just a few years ago would have brought her to tears but now she said they bring her comfort and make her smile. 'They are his words to me,' she said. 'I can't attribute it to anything but an act of God. I mean, I just can't believe it.' As Kellye Cloud rejoices her good fortune, Moore resident Tom Bridges also found a silver lining after the terrifying tornado flattened his home last week. The 68-year-old found a missing $2,000 amid the rubble of his property. Bridges thought the crisp bills, which he kept in an envelope tucked away atop a window sill, had blown away in the EF-5 rated twister that barreled through the suburb last Monday. But, after hours of searching through debris with a team of volunteers on Memorial Day, the cash miraculously turned up. 'All of a sudden, I saw the window sill. ... I picked that up, and there it was,' Bridges told CNN shortly after the find. 'I just, I couldn't believe my eyes. It was a miracle.' He told the network he plans to use the money to buy a new pickup truck, after the tornado totaled his old vehicles. 'Right now, money is money. I got the clothes on my back and a new toothbrush I bought,' he added. 'It means a lot. It's just these little things like that really bring some joy in my heart, which I need.' Bridges rode out the storm in his cellar and said he got buried in it for 25 minutes until he was rescued by strangers.","Kellye Cloud's purse was stolen four years ago at a Wallmart in Oklahoma .

He sent a telegram inviting the Beatle to join forces with him, jazz trumpeter Miles Davis and drummer Tony Williams in 1969, as the Fab Four were breaking up. It read: ‘We are recording and (sic) LP together this weekend. How about coming in to play bass?’ It was sent to McCartney at The Beatles’ Apple Records HQ in London on October 21, 1969, and told him to get in touch with producer Alan Douglas. Beatles aide Peter Brown replied on his behalf, telling Hendrix that McCartney was on holiday in Scotland and not due back for another two weeks. The telegram is on display at the Hard Rock Cafe in Prague. The telegraph reads: 'We are recording and LP together this weekend,"" it says, complete with a typographical error. ""How about coming in to play bass stop call Alan Douglas 212-5812212. Peace Jimi Hendrix Miles Davis Tony Williams' Vacation: Beatle aide Peter Brown replied on McCartney's behalf, telling Hendrix the following day that McCartney was on vacation and not expected back for another two weeks . But less attention has been paid to the bass player they were trying to recruit. This tantalizing detail about the super . group that never was - jazz standout Tony Williams would have been on . drums - is contained in an oft-overlooked telegram that Hendrix sent to . McCartney at The Beatles' Apple Records in London on Oct. 21, 1969. 'We are recording and LP together this weekend,' it says, complete with a typographical error. 'How about coming in to play bass stop call Alan Douglas 212-5812212. Peace Jimi Hendrix Miles Davis Tony Williams.' The telegram, advising McCartney to contact producer Douglas if he could make the session, has been part of the Hard Rock Cafe memorabilia collection since it was purchased at auction in 1995. Still it has only generated attention in recent months with the successful release of 'People, Hell & Angels,' expected to be the last CD of Hendrix's studio recordings. Come to light: The telegram only generated attention in recent months with the successful release of 'People, Hell & Angels,' expected to be the last CD of Hendrix's studio recordings . The telegram advises McCartney to contact a producer he could make the session with Miles Davis, left,  But McCartney had gone his family to their farm in Scotland to escape exposure to a rumour that he had died in a car crash and been replaced by a lookalike. 'It's not something you hear about a lot,' Hard Rock historian Jeff Nolan said of the telegram, now displayed at the restaurant in Prague. 'Major Hendrix connoisseurs are aware of it. It would have been one of the most insane supergroups. These four cats certainly reinvented their instruments and the way they're perceived.' French promoter and Hendrix fanatic Yazid Manou, who has researched the telegram, says it offers a glimpse of what might have been. 'It's amazing because of the names of the people,' he said. 'Of course that didn't happen, but the telegram brings us something to dream about. This is a document, proof that they had an idea to do an album.' The telegram raises more questions than it answers. It's not clear if McCartney was even aware of the unusual, apparently impromptu invitation to rush from his London base to New York for the planned session. Beatle aide Peter Brown replied on McCartney's behalf, telling Hendrix the following day that McCartney was on vacation and not expected back for another two weeks. The invitation came at an extremely awkward moment for the Beatles' bassist. It was sent the same day a prominent New York City radio station gave wide exposure to a rumor that McCartney had died in a car crash and been replaced by a lookalike. The bizarre story, supposedly supported by hints on Beatles records and album covers, briefly gained worldwide credibility. Timing: The telegram came at a time when the Beatles were falling apart due to business and artistic conflicts that likely would have been exacerbated by McCartney appearing on a record with Hendrix and Davis . Its dark nature apparently prompted the exasperated McCartney to retreat with his family to their farm in Scotland. It also came at a time when the Beatles were falling apart due to business and artistic conflicts that likely would have been exacerbated by McCartney appearing on a record with Hendrix and Davis. McCartney was also still bound by a songwriting partnership with John Lennon that might have further complicated the release of any McCartney-Hendrix-Davis compositions. And then there is the question of what the proposed group would have sounded like. Davis was moving away from his jazz roots toward a fusion-based sound. He said in his autobiography that by 1968 he was listening primarily to James Brown, Sly and the Family Stone and, particularly, Hendrix - musicians joined by a love of syncopated funk not found on Beatles' tracks. It is not clear either how McCartney's melodic, subtle bass playing would have made its presence felt in a band that included Hendrix' guitar and Davis' trumpet. 'At first, though, it sounds really weird and off the wall. But on second thought it makes perfect, Hendrix-type sense to chuck in someone who's a great musician but comes from a different tradition,' said Hendrix biographer Charles Shaar Murray. 'I regret this never actually took place. ... it would have been magnificent.' McCartney is the only one of the four musicians who is still alive. World tour: McCartney's spokesman said the former Beatle is too busy on his world tour to comb his memory for his thoughts about a telegram sent more than four decades ago . His spokesman, Stuart Bell, said the former Beatle is too busy on his world tour to comb his memory for his thoughts about a telegram sent more than four decades ago. In his autobiography, Davis said he and Hendrix occasionally jammed together at his apartment in New York City and tried to get into the studio to record but were hampered by financial matters and by their busy schedules. Murray and others maintain that Davis wanted $50,000 up front to attend the session. The Juilliard-trained trumpeter Davis described Hendrix, who learned his chops backing up the Isley Brothers and others, as a self-taught 'natural musician' who could not read music but was able to pick up complicated pieces in the blink of an eye. Davis says in the book that he and arranger Gil Evans were in Europe planning to record with Hendrix at the time of his death in London. 'What I didn't understand is why nobody told him not to mix alcohol and sleeping pills,' Davis wrote. Hendrix's death dashed their plans to record together, with or without McCartney. Eddie Kramer, the engineer who produced most of Hendrix's music, said there will always be speculation about what might have been. 'I think it would have been phenomenal,' Kramer said. 'Lord knows where it may have gone; those huge egos in the studio at the same time! I would have loved to have done that one. But it was not to be.'","Telegram advises McCartney to make contact if he could make the session .

Locked up: Kenneth Bae, who has been sentenced to 15 years of 'compulsory labour' by North Korea for unspecified crimes against the state . A Korean-American sentenced to 15 years hard labour in North Korea has started his sentence at a 'special prison.' Kenneth Bae, 44, was sentenced . earlier this month after being detained late last year leading a tour . group in the North Korean city of Rason, on the border with China. North Korea's Supreme Court accused the missionary of smuggling in inflammatory literature and trying to establish . a base for anti-Pyongyang activities at a border city hotel. Pyongyang said earlier this week that . Kenne Bae informed his family on Friday that he couldn't appeal his . April 30 sentence and that he asked his family to urge Washington to . push for his amnesty. Washington has called for Bae's release. North Korea delivered its most in-depth account yet of the case against Mr Bae last week, but the long list of allegations included no statement from him, other than claims that he confessed and didn't want an attorney present during his sentencing last week for what Pyongyang called hostile acts against the state. Since the sentencing came during a period of tentative diplomatic moves following weeks of high tension and North Korean threats of nuclear and missile strikes on Washington and Seoul, outside analysts have said Pyongyang may be using Bae as bait to win diplomatic concessions in the standoff over its nuclear weapons program. North Korea repeated its denial of such speculation in the new statement, but the pattern has occurred repeatedly. Tensions: The sentencing of Kenneth Bae will further complicate already strained relations between Pyongyang and Washington. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (3rd left) is pictured at a soccer match . The North's state media described the . statement from an unidentified Supreme Court spokesman as a response to . U.S. government and media assertions that the legal case against Bae . was unreasonable and other claims 'that he was not tried in a . transparent manner and (the North) was trying to use this issue as a . political bargaining chip.' The spokesman said Bae could've faced death but the court reduced the penalty because he confessed. Bae, . a Washington state resident described by friends as a devout Christian . and a tour operator, is at least the sixth American detained in North . Korea since 2009. The . others eventually were deported or released without serving out their . terms, some after trips to Pyongyang by prominent Americans, including . former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. There . has been no sign yet of a high-profile American envoy set to make a . clemency mission to North Korea, which has only recently eased a . near-daily, weekslong torrent of threats that followed greater U.N. sanctions over Pyongyang's February nuclear test. The North's statement said Bae gave anti-Pyongyang lectures in China and 'infiltrated' about 250 students into the city of Rason, a special economic zone in North Korea's far northeastern region bordering China and Russia. It didn't elaborate on the students' activities, however. Young leader Kim Jong Un has the power to grant special pardons under the North's constitution. Earlier this week, former NBA star Dennis Rodman attempted to use his friendship with Kim on Bae's behalf, asking the leader to 'do me a solid' and release the American. Rodman visited North Korea in February and apparently hit it off with Kim, a die-hard basketball fan. Pyongyang hasn't responded to Rodman's appeal on Twitter. Rodman said after his trip to North Korea that he planned to return in August to vacation with Kim. Buds: Dennis Rodman, left, has called on North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, right, to release American prisoner Kenneth Bae (Mr Rodman with Kim Jong Un in February during his visit to North Korea) Social Media: The former NBA star took to Twitter to send an informal plea to the North Korean leader . The U.S. has called for the North to immediately release Bae. It relies on Swedish diplomats in Pyongyang to deal with Bae's case because the North and the U.S. have had no formal diplomatic relations since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce instead of a peace treaty. North Korea said in the statement that Bae 'set up plot-breeding bases in different places of China for the purpose of toppling (North Korea's) government from 2006 to October 2012 out of distrust and enmity toward the' country. 'He committed such hostile acts as egging citizens of (North Korea) overseas and foreigners on to perpetrate hostile acts to bring down its government while conducting a malignant smear campaign against it. He was caught red handed.' North Korea refers to Bae as Pae Jun Ho, the North Korean spelling for his Korean name. North Korea has faced increasing international criticism over its weapons development. Six-nation disarmament talks involving the Koreas, the United States, Japan, China and Russia fell apart in 2009. Several rounds of U.N. sanctions have not encouraged the North to give up its small cache of nuclear devices, which Pyongyang says it must not only keep but expand to protect itself from a hostile Washington. Tensions have escalated since it conducted its third nuclear test since 2006 in February. The human rights group Amnesty International has criticized Bae's lack of access to a lawyer and called for his release. Friends and colleagues say Bae was based in the Chinese border city of Dalian and traveled frequently to North Korea to feed orphans.","Kenneth Bae, 44, was sentenced to 15 years hard labour earlier .

A mother had to face every parent's worst nightmare after her daughter fell from a high diving board and it was feared she could be brain damaged or paralysed. Eight-year-old Abby was taken to the A&E department at London's King's College Hospital following her three metre fall onto concrete. Abby loved swimming and diving at her local leisure centre and had slipped and banged her head as she climbed the steps to the five metre diving board. Vigil: Worried mother Nikki reassures her daughter Abby in A&E following her fall from a diving board . Her story is revealed in tonight's episode of Channel 4 reality show 24 Hours in A&E and shows her mother Nikki's ordeal as she faces her daughter's injuries and tries to stay brave for her little girl. Leader of the trauma team Tushar, a paediatric intensive care consultant, has to tell Nikki to expect the worst when Abby is first taken in by the paramedics because he said he will not 'give false hope.' He said: 'Seeing her (Abby) getting drowsy was not good, her brain could be under pressure from a blood clot.' Terrifying: Nikki said it was awful facing the prospect her daughter could be brain damaged or paralysed . Tushar explains to Nikki that her daughter will need a CT scan to find out if there is a bleed on her brain. 'I noticed the sheer look of panic and that bottled-up emotion that every mother has when they're scared,' he recalled of Nikki's reaction. Nikki from South London admitted it was 'frightening' seeing her daughter with so many doctors around her and getting injections but was relieved when the CT scan showed no bleeding on Abby's brain. However, she was then warned there was a possibility Abby's spine had been damaged by her fall. Nikki said: 'You feel helpless. To actually face that your child could be paralysed, it's just the worst feeling ever.' But Nikki had to bottle up her own fears as she sought to reassure her scared daughter. She said: 'For someone who was so bubbly, it's sad to see her little broken body and her broken spirit, but I . still had to say to her, 'you're going to be fine, . you're doing really well,' just to get . through it.' Helpless: Abby's father, Scott, was stuck in Scotland as the drama unfolded . Meanwhile, Abby's father, Scott, was stranded in Scotland after missing the last train home after working in Edinburgh for the day. He said he was in agony at not being able to be at his daughter's bedside and support his wife during their time of need. 'I just wanted to comfort Abby or just . comfort Nikki,' he said. 'Suddenly you just realise that your family, that you've created, it's bigger than anything really. And you just . feel as though you want to make everything better or just to . look after them, protect them.' The family were relieved when Abby's X-ray revealed no injury to her spine, but she had fractured her eye socket and had to be kept in over-night so doctors could continue to monitor her. Despite the horrific circumstances, Nikki said it was 'quite a special time, that night, because you're just open and vulnerable and fragile.' 'For me . having that connection that night as a mother to a daughter, I . think it will always remain with me,' she said. Recovered: Abby fractured her eye socket but hasn't lost her love of diving . After Abby was allowed to go home, her parents recalled how it took her a little while to get back to her old self. 'After the accident there was a period when we didn't have our little girl, we had some girl . who was quite morbid,' Scott said. Nikki added that for a week after, she and Scott 'would just burst out crying for no reason' because of all the 'pent-up emotion.' But now she's recovered, Abby said her ordeal hasn't put her off diving. 'I would like to go high but I thought just leave it for a few weeks and then start doing the five metre again,' she said. Watch Abby's story in tonight (Wednesday's) 24 Hours in A&E, Channel 4 at 9pm or catch up on 4oD .","Abby fell three metres onto concrete .
