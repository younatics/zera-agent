"By . Steph Cockroft . Two thugs left a man to freeze after pushing him in the world's third most dangerous river, in what was described as an 'aggressive' and 'homophobic' attack. Serial offenders Kallum Crosby, 20 - who had been released from prison just one day earlier - and Jamie Norris, 22, attacked the 36-year-old man in January this year 'because he's gay', the court was told. The two men, both from Hull, followed the victim to Victoria Pier as he left a club, before cornering him for his mobile phone near what is known as The Deep. Kallum Crosby, 20, left, and Jamie Norris, 22, right, jailed after pushing a 36-year-old into the River Humber in January in a homophobic attack. The two men left the victim waist-deep in mud and went to get a takeaway . They then pushed him into the River Humber - considered to be the third most dangerous tidal estuary in the world - before going off to get a takeaway, where they bragged about what they had done. Hull Crown Court was told the temperature at the time was 7 degrees and the victim could have easily suffered from hypothermia. The man would have had just ten minutes to survive if the tide had been in and he'd gone underwater, the court was told. Crosby - who has 48 previous convictions - and Norris both pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted robbery. The judge told the defendants - who were both jailed - they were lucky they were not facing a homicide charge, considering the conditions on the night. During the hearing, prosecutor Philip Standfast told how the pair followed the victim, before trying to grab his phone. They then told the man, who had left the club after a dispute with his partner, that he was 'going nowhere' - before rifling through this pockets and shouting 'You f****** queer!' The duo then pushed the man into the river. Luckily, the men had not managed to grab the victim's phone - meaning he was able to call the police who came to his rescue. The River Humber, where the 36-year-old was pushed by two thugs. The victim managed to phone police from the river using his mobile phone . Mr Standfast said: 'He landed in thick mud and was naked from the waist up. He could not move his feet and was covered in thick mud. 'It was dark and he was alone and he did not know where he was. He saw both of the defendants were laughing at his predicament. 'Fortunately they had not taken his telephone. He called police and the emergency services were fortunate in being able to find him in the dark and extract him from the mud.' The victim was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary where he was treated for a cut to the eye and other cuts and bruises. Meanwhile, the two men went to a takeaway restaurant in Hull's old town and boasted about what they had done, the court was told. Mr Standfast said: 'Crosby told a woman behind the counter they had just pushed a man in the river because he was gay. 'The assistant thought at first they were joking, but saw they had mud on their clothing. 'They said they had left him in the river and did not know if he had drowned. Crosby said they werenâ€™t bothered. Hull Crown Court, where the two defendants pleaded guilty to attempted robbery, after trying to snatch the victim's phone . 'The woman asked her his name and he told her and said he had just been released from prison.' In a victim impact statement, the man said: 'I have suffered sleepless nights. The next day I was still in shock at what might have happened. I cannot stop thinking, what if? 'What if they had taken the telephone? I have suffered from sickness and for the first time in five years, I have had to take time off work.' Crosby's defence barrister Chris Dunn said: 'This is one of those cases which make you shudder when you think of the catastrophic consequences that could have followed for this sort of behaviour. 'This could easily have been a homicide, fortunately the man had his phone. 'While I accept the incident may haunt the complainant there were not bad physical injuries. That was luck rather than judgement. 'When he is released he was thinking of becoming a fireman. I think the chances of that may have evaporated as a result of this offending.' Norris's defence barrister Charlotte Baines said the trainee bricklayer had two young children aged two and three. She said he thought about going in the Army, but quit after basic training at Catterick to join a relationship. She said: 'He feels terrible and very sorry for what happened to the complainant.' Judge Bury said it was aggravated because a man had been left in a life threatening situation. He said: 'It was particularly aggressive and you were homophobic. You called him a 'f****** queer c***. You gave him a bear hug and then you pushed him in the Humber. 'If the tide had been in he would have been under water. You could see the situation he was in, but you both ran off laughing. You made no effort to help him. 'You went to a takeaway where you were laughing and boasting about it. You said you did not care if he was still in the water or not. 'He was targeted because of his . sexuality. He was approached and lured down the pier.' He sentenced Crosby to four and a half years in prison and Norris three years and nine months.","Kallum Crosby, 20 and Jamie Norris, 22, attacked the victim, 36, in Hull .

"By . Margot Peppers . A little girl got the surprise of her life when her blanket and stuffed animal lambie were returned to her in the mail after she thought she'd lost them forever. Seven-year-old Reagan Porter, from Eden Prairie, Minnesota, was vacationing with her parents in Montgomery, Texas, when she accidentally left her precious cargo behind.

Thankfully, hotel employee Christina Cooper went the extra mile to find them . Christina Cooper, 25, the resort's loss-prevention lead supervisor, told ABC News that Mr Porter called her the day he and his family checked out in the hopes that she could return the toys to his daughter. After an initial search, she failed to find them and assumed they'd gotten mixed up in laundry. But about a month later, Mrs Cooper - who has a three-year-old son of her own - checked the housekeeping bin once more and discovered what she had been looking for. Eager to put a smile on little Reagan's face, she found the Porters' information and called them immediately. The girl's father answered. Success story: The resort's loss-prevention lead supervisor Christina Cooper, who has a three-year-old son of her own, found the items about a month later and called Mr Porter immediately .

'I could tell he was . hoping it would be about her lost stuffed animal.' Not only did she want to return the beloved things to Reagan, but Mrs Cooper also decided to go the extra mile to make the little girl especially happy.

"By . Martyn Ziegler, Press Association . Manchester City and Paris St Germain are expected to have financial restrictions imposed on their squads for next season's Champions League after breaching UEFA's spending rules. The expenditure restrictions for breaking the financial fair play (FFP) rules would see both clubs effectively given a limit on the salary bill of their European A squad. The clubs are also expected to be ordered to make a cut in the number of players permitted in the A squad, which is normally 25-strong, and to be handed large fines when UEFA's club financial control board (CFCB) meets on Thursday and Friday, when a number of other European clubs will also be dealt with. Sanctions: Man City owner Sheikh Mansour (left) has ploughed millions in to the club. Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (second right) and chief executive Ferran Soriano (right) are involved in the day-to-day running . Seeing red: Pablo Zabaleta (left) is sent off during the Champions League final defeat by Barcelona in March . The sanctions packages are understood to be part of a settlement offer to the clubs, which they can accept, reject or try to negotiate ahead of the meeting. Both UEFA and City have refused to comment but it is understood the relevant sanction in the FFP rules set to be applied is: 'Restriction on the number of players that a club may register for participation in UEFA competitions, including a financial limit on the overall aggregate cost of the employee benefits expenses of players registered on the A-list for the purposes of UEFA club competitions.' The idea of the sanctions is that a restriction in the expenditure on players by both clubs who have breached the rules will help them in their efforts to comply with the limits on losses in future seasons. Clubs can lose up to 45 million euros (£37million) over the last two years under UEFA's rules. City made losses of £97.9million in 2012 and £51.6million last year, but were able to write off some sums spent on facilities, youth development and a number of other items. Hot water: PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates a goal against Bayer Leverkusen in February . Both Abu Dhabi-owned City and PSG have a number of sponsorship deals related to their owners which the CFCB had to determine were of fair market value. Qatari-owned PSG effectively wiped out its annual losses of 130 million euros (£107.4million) by announcing a back-dated sponsorship deal with the Qatar Tourism Authority worth up to 200 million euros a year. According to French newspaper La Parisien, the CFCB determined that PSG's sponsorship deal with the tourism authority should have a fair market value of half its current price. No other English club has been deemed to have breached the FFP rules, and UEFA president Michel Platini said last week he did not think any of the clubs - understood to number fewer than 20 - who breached rules will be banned from European competition next season. All sanctions are expected to be confirmed by UEFA's FFP adjudicatory body next week.","Man City and Paris Saint-Germain found to have breached Financial Fair Play .

"By . Ashley Pearson . Against my will, I've become a bargain basement shopper. Whereas I once frequented the hallowed halls of Harrods, now it's Poundland and Primark. Just the lighting alone is jarring, to say the least. What's interesting though, is that I frequently catch the eye of one of my well turned out peers who I'm certain is making the same adjustment as me. Ashley Pearson says it is possible to live a champagne lifestyle on a tighter budget . In our case it's a new baby that has made the difference, but for some it may be saving to get on the property ladder, expensive IVF treatments, school fees or buying a new home. Whatever it is, it's nice to know that I'm not alone. Having said that, although my formerly Champagne lifestyle is rapidly downshifting into a Prosecco world - my tastes haven't changed at all. And whilst I find myself hurtling towards middle age in a home cluttered with Fisher Price, I can tell you that I am not ready to swap my DVF for Boden and my Choos for Clarks. At least not yet. Therefore, after careful investigation, I've put together a guide to the best luxe-loving and glam values out there. And if, like me, your budget no longer matches your carefully cultivated taste levels, this one's for you. Let's talk linens. I'm a total bed linen snob and I can talk thread count with the best of them. The first time my 4 month old vomited on my 1200 count white Turkish cotton I felt a physical pain. Thankfully I've now discovered a website called Best Bed Linen. They've supplied top five-star hotels for over 20 years; including The Savoy, The Goring, and Claridges. Best Bed Linen supply bedding for luxury hotels such as The Savoy but there sets are available from £115 . This is a  5-star sleep experience in your own home. A set, which includes a flat or fitted sheet, duvet cover and 2-4 pillowcases starts at £115. www.thebestbedlinenintheworld.com . For those of us who like to cook, or in my case have fancy pots and pans I don't use, on display - we all know how expensive Le Crueset is. Gorgeous, lasts forever and a true status symbol on the stove. Check out Sainsbury's new range that comes in a kicky aqua and fantastic lapis blue. A great alternative, cooks like a dream and looks v snazzy. Ashley loves the Le Crueset style pots available at Sainsburys . And what about the all important beauty upkeep? Celebrites such as Kim Kardashian have personal Spray Tanners who come to their home and give them a customised spray tan. No more streaking, no brown palms or stains in between fingers. And in London at least you can get a similar service on a budget. Beau Bronz, which sprays for TV shows like This Morning and Dancing on Ice offers a bespoke spray tan for £40. And even better, they come to you! This service is available across London (Call Abi 07968133221 or Rachel 07872945044) I know Tesco does well for clothes but I had no idea they made such stylish home accessories. Recently bemoaning the costs of setting up a home office, I was delighted to discover a great range of options. This stylish lamp for £25 was a steal. Ashley was pleasantly surprised by the range of stylish homewears available at Tesco . Are you amongst those of us who can immediately identify Jo Malone's Lime Basil Mandarin cologne (£78)? Bronnley has made a very clever substitute. It's called Lime and Bergamot and every time I wear it, I get asked if it's the Jo Malone signature scent. I am in love with it as much as I am the fact that it costs a mere £14. Ashley says that Bronnley's Lime & Bergamot scent could easily be mistaken for Jo Malone . Although I am not by any means an . attachment parent, a new baby invariably made us long for a bigger bed. Early morning play and sleep sessions, and just general exhaustion left . us fighting for our corners. I got a tip off from a producer friend who works on a home design show. Apparently this site is a  major decorator's secret with designer furnishings that look more expensive than they are. www.loveyourhomeforless.com. We ordered the Isabella Storage Bed, and I can honestly say that in addition to saving more than 1000 pounds from others I had found, it's the prettiest bed I've ever seen. Ashley saved more than £1000 on her bed from Love Your Home for Less . I admit it, I am a total and complete candle snob. I can smell a Diptyque from a mile away, but at something like £40, their role in my household expenditures is now taken over by Pampers and Aptamil. I have found some lovely, less expensive alternatives. Check out Illume's Anemone, lovely looking and at £22, good value (beautybay.com). Also the dotcomgiftshop has some beautifully elegant candles for just £9.95 - I loved the Moroccon Rose and Fig. Ashley is a self confessed candle snob but is very keen on the dotcomgiftshop's offerings at £9.95 . I'll never forget when a very famous British TV presenter confessed to me that her massive diamond wedding rings set was from Carat. 'Everyone expects me to have enormous and expensive rings, but I'd never spend that kind of money on jewellery.' Her sparkling 'diamonds' were so pretty and I'd always envied them, I couldn't believe they weren't the real thing. So, if your budget doesn't allow for the ring from Tiffany's you covet, check out Carat. Some of their pieces are truly lovely - and would fool all but the most practiced eye. www.carat.co . Carat is great for those of you without a Tiffany budget . My feet changed dramatically whilst pregnant, so post baby I was faced with a priceless wardrobe of shoes that no longer fit. You can thus imagine my utter delight upon discovering Moda in Pelle which does a mean Louboutin inspired white heel and a kicky pair that look like 'Tod's'. However, it was this pair that really got me excited. They are very similar to the expensive wedges that Jennifer Aniston LIVES IN and retail for £50 instead of Jen's £230 version. Despite being grounded at home more these days, I still love a little night away. The free to download app HotelTonight allows you to book a room in 250 destinations at a huge discount. Ashley loves Moda in Pelle's wedges that steal Jennifer Anniston's style for £50 . The only catch is, you can't choose the hotel until the day of - but they have gorgeous properties in most major cities, and you are virtually guaranteed a lovely selection. We tried the swanky Beaufort hotel in Knightsbridge at a 50% savings and loved it. And another cash saving trick is to look out for new hotel launches. CEO of . luxury travel specialists Fox PR www.foxpr.co.uk  Lysbeth Fox says, . 'Hotels traditionally offer great value when they first open. Keep on . top of local news in the location you're interested in, watch for hotel . openings and book early. Travel specialist Lysbeth Fox recommends the D-Resort Gocek in Dalaman, Turkey, for a spring break . Ashley stayed in the Kalamar Dream Villa on a recent trip to Turkey and said it was great value for money . 'You . can often secure an incredible deal if you're amongst the first wave of . guests.' Her pick this season? D-Resort Gocek in Dalaman, Turkey which . opens in May. Early bookings are now only £150 per night for the . 5-star, ultra glam, beach-fronted hotel, dresortgocek.com.tr. Ashley says that although she is spending more and more time in Primark, she is a Harrods girl at heart . And for planning a trip for the whole family, if you want luxury without a massive hotel bill, consider Holiday Lettings (holidaylettings.co.uk). We stayed at the Villa Kalamar Dream (Home ID 76799) on a recent trip to Turkey and were completely blown away. And at 222 pounds a night, a cost shared by 6 adults, it was incredible value. Breath-taking sea views, roof deck terraces with sun loungers,  fresh bread delivered each morning, maid service and chefs available, as well as an infinity pool and flat screened entertainment system to die for; it was truly A-list living. It was ideal for a family and far less pricey than a hotel. For general pampering, look for ways to multi-task your treatments. Edward James' Aveda salons offer 15 minute 'Glow Facials' for clients who want to use their down-time in the salon (when colour is processing) or whilst their hair is being shampooed and conditioned. At £20 each the mini-facials are combined with a hand and arm massage and a lie down on a reclining massage bed.  If the treatments are booked with a colour service they are just £15. The bottom line: you may be more likely to spot me at Poundland than Prada these days, but I still like the finer things in life. And until things change, you'll find me dreaming of the day when TK Maxx stocks Crème de la Mer and Victoria Beckham designs.","Our style blogger Ashley Pearson has had to make a few cut backs since becoming a mother .

"By . Bianca London . She scooped best designer at the prestigious British plus-size fashion awards so as Gemma Collins unveils her fifth clothing collection, she has every right to be proud of her achievements. 'I've changed fashion,' she says boldly. 'Women can get beautiful plus-size clothes thanks to me and I've opened a lot of doors for the industry. That's why I'll be here for my 120th collection.'

Gemma explains that she has been up most mornings at 4am working on her fifth range, which is full of flirty kaftans, lace dresses and casual tops that she promises will be 'a wardrobe staple for anyone'. Named after Caribbean islands, such as St. Barts and Barbados, Gemma says that each design will transport you to the place and the bright colours of each design will brighten up everyone's wardrobes this summer. And it seems that it's already working wonders - Gemma has had countless people stopping her in the street to thank her for designing clothes for fuller-figured women - and she always stops to have a photo with them.

"By . Binky Felstead . Hello my lovelies... It's been all go for me this week - after returning from a lovely weekend break in Paris, I've been flitting from filming to meeting to photoshoot without a minute to spare! Being a busy bee means I don't have much time to spend perfecting my make-up in the mornings, so I've conjured up a fresh-faced seasonal look that is super quick and easy to apply. It's super-flattering on all skin tones and works well for both day and night - it's definitely been my go-to look this spring! Here's how to get it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This week Binky reinvents her beauty routine for spring . GET THE LOOK . Step 1 - Cover Up . First up, even out your skintone with a light foundation such as Guerlain Terracotta Skin Healthy Glow Foundation. I'm not a fan of a heavy base in spring, especially in the daytime, so the light, gel-like texture of this foundation is ideal. Rub it into your face using your fingers - this will warm the product up so it glides smoothly over the skin. If you've got any pesky blemishes that need a bit of extra coverage, hide them away with bareMinerals Correcting Concealer. Remember to dab - not to rub or blend - your cover-up onto the area you're looking to conceal. Step 2 - Glow On . The essential weapon in my glow-getting arsenal is a liquid highlighter or highlighting pen, like Liz Earle's Light Reflecting Concealer or Dior Skinflash Radiance Booster Pen. Take the pen down your nose, under your eyes, on your forehead and under your brow bone, as well as a touch above your Cupid's bow and on your chin. Essentially, apply the highlight anywhere the light would naturally hit your face for a dewy, luminous complexion. Blend the product in gently with your fingertips or a beauty blending sponge. Binky says this look is perfect for girls who don't have much time in the morning . Step 3 - Bright Eyes . Next, adorn your eyelids with a cream eyeshadow or primer with a hint of shimmer - I used bareMinerals Prime Time Brightening Eye Primer. This look is relatively minimal, so the aim here is to even out any discolouration on the lids and brighten up the eye area. Adding white eyeliner to the waterline of your eyes is a timeless trick which will make eyes look brighter, wider and more awake. Binky suggests using white eyeliner to make eyes look more awake . Apply an ivory shade of kohl pencil (Dior Crayon Kohl and Rimmel Soft Kohl Kajal are both great) gently across your waterline. Then give your lashes a flirtatious flutter with a light coating of mascara. I've used The Body Shop's volumising mascara - another I'd recommend is Clarins' Wonder Perfect Mascara. The contrast between the white liner and dark lashes will give your peepers an irresistible doe-eyed effect. Step 4 - Bronze Up . Although this is very much a minimal make-up look, I couldn't forego my beloved bronzer! Warm up your cheeks with a touch of Daniel Sandler's Watercolour Crème Bronzer in Riviera - the creamy formulation perfectly complements the rest of the base products used. Apply with your fingers, blending in circular motions. Binky says that although this is a fairly natural look she could never go without her trusty bronzer . Step 5 - Pink Lady . You could easily just dab a touch of Vaseline onto the lips to complete this look, but I've chosen to add a more vibrant pop of colour to my pout. I applied Daniel Sandler Luxury Lipstick in the peachy pink shade Joy to my lips straight from the bullet. Dab the product into your lips with your fingers for a sexy, slightly worn-in stained effect. Step 6 - Flawless Finish . Finally, lightly spritz a finishing spray such as Mac's Fix + all over the face. This sets the make-up in place as well as giving the skin a dewy sheen. Binky suggests these spring beauty staples to achieve her look . For a glow to-go, I highly recommend the ultra-refreshing Caudalie Grape Water. Pop a small bottle into your handbag and spray it on any time you need an instant moisture boost. And there you have it - a gorgeously glowy springtime face that couldn't be easier to achieve. I'm hoping to accessorise this look with an ice-cold mojito in a beer garden this weekend...let's pray for some sun! Until next week, .

"By . Katy Winter . Facebook can often seem like a rather unhealthy habit these days, as we spend hours mindlessly checking our news feeds or uploading vain selfies. But for one overweight mother the social networking site proved to be just the kick she needed to shape up and get healthy when an unflattering photo shamed her into losing an incredible 8st in weight. Tracy Nicholson, 34, a childcare provider, ditched fatty snacks after she was horrified by a photo of her enjoying a night out with friends. The picture which persuaded Tracy to lose weight after she was 'horrified; when it was uploaded to Facebook . Tracey dropped from 19st 2lb (left) to 11st 2lb (right) by drastically changing her diet . Miss Nicholson, a mother of two from . Cramlington in Northumberland, said: 'I uploaded the picture but regretted . it immediately. I was suddenly very anxious about what people would . think about me - about how I could have let myself become so overweight. 'I was horrified - and knew I had to stop making excuses and do something about it.' Miss Nicholson began putting on weight after she left school and struggled to control her overeating following the birth of her son Dylan, now 8, and daughter Chloe, 5. By the winter of 2012 Miss Nicholson, whose partner James Shaw, 37, works as a painter and decorator, weighed 19st 2lb. She said: 'I’d fallen into the habit of snacking on crisps and eating chocolate and thought nothing of routinely ordering a takeaway when I got to the weekend. 'I never had any energy and keeping up with the children was proving to be increasingly difficult. James said he didn’t care about my size, but it was starting to get me down. 'When I put the picture on Facebook, I was mortified. I didn’t want other people to see me that way.' Tracey has banned crisps from her diet and totally eliminated snacking, joining a slimming club to give her moral support during her weight loss . Shortly afterwards Miss Nicholson attended a GP appointment where her weight was confirmed. She joined a local slimming group where she drew up an eating plan which permanently banned crisps from her daily diet. While she . was overweight, she had typically eaten two slices of toast for . breakfast, followed by a cheese sandwich and a packet of salt and . vinegar crisps for lunch, followed by an evening meal of sausage and . chips. She would snack on crisps and chocolate with coffee throughout . the day. Today, . she usually has fruit or boiled eggs for breakfast, then ham salad with . beetroot and pickled onions for lunch, followed by a handful of pasta . with cheese in the evening. Instead of snacks, she usually treats . herself to a cup of fruit tea. Tracey, pictured left with boyfriend James,  says her dramatic eight st weight loss has transformed her life beyond recognition . She said: 'I gave myself four weeks - that’s how long I thought I’d last at slimming club. But by the end of the fifth week I was still there, and I was amazed to find that I’d lost a stone and a half. As I kept losing more and more, I was only more motivated to keep going with the eating plan.' Today, Miss Nicholson weighs 11st 2lb. She said: 'I have so much more energy now and keeping up with the kids is great fun - we race each other on the school run. 'James always loved me the way I was, but it’s something that I had to do for myself. I’m so glad I managed to keep going, when I only gave myself a few weeks to start with. 'My life has changed out of all recognition - I feel so much better now, and I don’t worry about putting photos on Facebook any more.'","Tracey struggled to lose weight after the birth of her two children .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Actress Barbara Hershey has admitted that Hollywood is 'a desert' for women her age, but that she is happy to embrace the aging process - which seems to be unfolding pretty slowly in her case. The 66-year-old Insidious actress, who looks staggeringly youthful for her age, has accredited her fresh appearance to a number of wise lifestyle choices over the years. 'I think I've always looked about ten years younger than I am all my life,' she tells ABC News, adding: 'Being healthy [helps]. I'm not a drinker. I haven't abused myself.' Youthful: Actress Barbara Hershey, pictured here at the premiere of Insidious: Chapter 2 last September, attributes her fresh appearance to her healthy lifestyle, which includes no alcohol . The brunette star also insists she 'doesn't do surgery' and that she is careful with her diet. 'I don't eat sugar and I don't eat grains, at least in this point in my life,' she reveals. 'It's been really a positive thing for me.' Ms Hershey, who played Natalie Portman's obsessive mother in Darren Aronofsky's Oscar-winning hit, Black Swan, in 2010, acknowledged the fact that Hollywood parts are scarce for older actresses. 'It really is a desert for women my age. I hate saying that publicly because it sounds like you are complaining, . but it's just the facts,' she says. Knockout: The star, who played Natalie Portman's neurotic mother in Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan in 2010, pictured, says she eschews sugar and grains and 'doesn't do' surgery . Ms Hershey points to Game of Thrones as an example of a hugely successful show which includes a full 'spectrum' of people of all ages in 'equally important' roles. On the subject of her own aging, the Golden Globe-winning actress announced she was 'not afraid' of the process. 'I'm afraid of everyone else's reaction to my aging!' she laughs. Ms Hershey quoted legendary actor, the late Peter O'Toole, as saying that the best thing to him about wrinkles was that he had earned every one of them. And she wholeheartedly agrees, adding that her wrinkles are the 'map of her life', something to 'hang on to and adore'. Secure: Ms Hershey, pictured with Bette Midler in the 1988 cult classic Beaches, claims she's more afraid of 'everyone else's' reaction to her aging than her own feelings about it . Throwback: Ms Hershey, pictured here in 1970, earned herself a guilty-by-association reputation after she married notorious drug-user David Carradine in 1969, which damaged her career for a while . The sprightly siren says she spends part of her time in Hawaii, 'getting up with the sun' and enjoys painting. But her life hasn't always been so smooth sailing. Acquiring a reputation as something of a hippie early on in her career, which begun when she was only 17, Ms Hershey suffered a blow to her prestige when, in 1969, she married controversial actor David Carradine. For the duration of her marriage to Mr Carradine, who was a regular drug-user and passed away in 2009, her private life was scrutinized and ridiculed. I never used drugs at all and I have always been serious about my acting career . She earned herself a guilty-by-association reputation, which she has since claimed was unfounded. 'Producers wouldn't see me because I had a reputation for using drugs and being undependable,' she said in a 1975 interview. 'I never used drugs at all and I have always been serious about my acting career.' Ms Hershey also discusses one of her latest films, Sister, an Indie movie about a dysfunctional family in which she plays a bipolar mother. The actress says she turned to YouTube to watch real clips of bipolar sufferers who film themselves during 'manic' or 'depressed' phases. She adds that she also took inspiration from a number of her bipolar friends, who she describes as 'amazing, creative' people who 'go through a lot'. Sister will be released later this year.","Star admits Hollywood is a 'desert' for women of her age .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Holograms have featured in futuristic sci-fi films for decades, from Star Wars to Minority Report and Prometheus, but Apple could be about to make the technology mainstream - and small enough to fit in your pocket. New Apple patent files detail a display that appears to float 3D images, or holograms, above it, and these holograms can then be moved using finger gestures. The process involves a system that creates the 3D image, an optical system that puts this image into the air, and a touch sensor. The patent details a display that appears to float 3D images, or holograms, above it and these holograms can then be moved using finger gestures and swipes. Patent drawing pictured.

"By . Ben Spencer . Saved? Scientists claim tomatoes grown amongst other vegetables could protected from whiteflies . It is a problem that has puzzled generations of gardeners - but keeping annoying pests away from prized tomatoes may in fact be very simple. Academics have found that the whitefly, a devastating bug that weaken and kill plants, are easily distracted by the smell of other vegetables. Simply mixing tomatoes in amongst other plants such as cucumbers or courgettes may be enough to keep the pests at bay. Scientists at the University of Newcastle exposed whitefly to a heady aroma of watercress, watermelon, cabbage, cucumber, courgette and beans. As a result, the insects struggled to attack tomato plants growing in a greenhouse. Dr Colin Tosh, who co-wrote the study, said: 'It's like trying to concentrate on work while the TV's on and the radio's blaring out and someone's talking to you. 'You can't do it - or at least not properly or efficiently - and it's the same for the whitefly. 'Whiteflies use their sense of smell to locate tomato plants. By bombarding its senses with a range of different smells we create ""sensory confusion"" and the result is that the insect becomes disorientated and is unable to feed.' Whitefly is a major worldwide threat to greenhouse crops and is traditionally controlled using chemical pesticides or natural parasites. But the research has opened up the possibilities of an effective, organic way of battling the pest, both on an industrial scale and in amateurs' back gardens or allotments. Like many pests, a whitefly feeds by pushing its long mouthpiece into a leaf until it reaches the nutrient-rich plant sap. In doing so it weakens the plant and leaves behind a sticky excretion that encourages the development of mould. Pests struggled to get to the tomatoes hidden between courgettes, beans and cabbages . But locating the right plant cells is technically challenging for the insect and can go wrong if it is distracted. The study, published in the journal Agronomy of Sustainable Development, shows that the 'confusion effect' of an array of vegetable smells can be used to protect a single crop. It distracts the bug long enough for the plant's own defence mechanism to kick in, producing a chemical that makes it and neighbouring plants unpalatable to insects. Dr Tosh said: 'Because the effect is temporary - we saw it last no more than 15 hours - it's unlikely this method alone could be used to control crop pests. But this is an easy and safe way of buying the plants time until their own chemical defence mechanisms kick in. 'Used in conjunction with other methods, sensory confusion opens up a whole new area in sustainable pest control.' The findings suggest there could be an organic way to fight pests on an industrial scale and at home . Co-author Dr Barry Brogan, also from the University of Newcastle, said: 'Plants talk to each other when they are under attack, producing chemicals which warn other plants close by of the threat. At the same time, they produce a chemical which is unpleasant to the predator. 'But this response doesn't happen immediately, so if we can confuse the insects long enough to give the plants time to defend themselves this may go some way to reducing crop losses.' The authors think that the same technique could be used to battle other pests, such as blackfly and aphids, and the principle should apply to vegetables other than tomatoes. Dr Brogan said that the team is talking to industrial growers about developing an organic spray which pumps the scent of other vegetables into a glasshouse. But for amateur growers, simply planting vegetables among other varieties should do just as well - whether in a greenhouse or in the garden. 'Mixing things up should really do the trick,' he said.","Scientists at the University of Newcastle clustered plants together .

The expansion, announced yesterday in New York, makes Yahoo the latest technology company to mount a challenge to Netflix, which runs the internet's largest internet video subscription service. Microsoft, Amazon.com and Hulu.com are among the other companies angling for a piece of the growing audience watching video piped over high-speed internet connections. Scroll down for video . Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer has unveiled plans to break into television-style original video with the launch of two original comedy series and an internet channel that will stream live concerts. The expansion makes Yahoo the latest technology company to mount a challenge to Netflix . Yahoo's comedies are Other Space, a 'galactic adventure' set in the 22nd century, which is being created for Yahoo by Paul Feig, who directed the film Bridesmaids and who created the Freaks and Geeks television series. The second comedy is Sin City Saints, which follows the owner of a fictional pro basketball expansion team. It is the product of executive producer Mike Tollin and director Bryan Gordon, whose resumes include TV shows such as Smallville, One Tree Hill and Curb Your Enthusiasm. The series will be shown on the Yahoo website, mobile app, Apple TV and Roku devices from next year. Financial terms of Yahoo's deals to license the new series weren't disclosed. However, Yahoo doesn't plan to charge viewers to watch the series. Yahoo currently trails far behind other online video providers.

Yahoo's comedy is being created for Yahoo by Paul Feig (left). Microsoft has also announced several new original online video programmes. The group hired former CBS boss Nancy Tellem (right) to head up its new TV studio, which will produce shows to be watched on the firm's Xbox games console and mobile devices . Netflix recently agreed to pay Verizon to ensure its video streams receive priority over the ISPs network. It comes amid growing concern over ISPs plans to throttle high-bandwidth services such as Netflix - and claims from Netflix boss Reed Hastings that payments are an 'arbitrary tax'. The deal comes just weeks after a similar agreement with Comcast was revealed. The deal has already paid off for Comcast subscribers, and recent figures show Netflix's videos are streaming through Comcast's Internet service at their highest speeds in 17 months. Instead, the Sunnyvale-based company hopes to make money from selling additional advertising. 'Our goal is to not only enable the future but also to help invent it,' said Kathy Savitt, Yahoo's chief marketing officer. Yahoo boasts one of the web's largest audiences but the company has been struggling for years to come up with compelling products to reverse a long-running decline in ad sales. It made modest progress during the opening three months of the year as its net advertising revenue rose five per cent from last year. Chief executive Marissa Mayer has repeatedly said it may take several more years before Yahoo's ad sales are keeping pace with the overall internet market. Yahoo also announced a new partnership with concert promoter Live Nation that will involve streaming one live concert every day beginning in the summer. Companies such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and Microsoft have been looking to compete with traditional TV programming to increase revenue.  Netflix recently agreed to pay Verizon to ensure its video streams receive priority over the ISPs network . Internet companies are increasingly rushing to produce original online video programming, as consumers spend more time on the web and as devices such as the Roku and Microsoft Corp's Xbox allow consumers to stream online video straight to their television sets. Microsoft announced several new original online video programmes, including a football reality show, earlier on Monday. Microsoft has signed up comedians Sarah Silverman and Seth Green for its projects. It hired former CBS boss Nancy Tellem to head up its new TV studio, which will produce shows to be watched on the firm's Xbox games console as well as its mobile devices. Amazon Prime has also added multiple . scripted and animated shows to its subscription-based Prime service, and . only sweetened the deal with the recently-released Fire TV box meant to . stream the content directly on to televisions. When it comes to original programming, Microsoft is going to throw it at the Xbox and see what sticks. After nearly two years since launching a studio to create new shows to be streamed on Xbox consoles, Microsoft is finally ready to serve an assorted helping of original programming this summer for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One. However, viewers shouldn't expect Xbox Originals, as they're called, to be available the same way that content is provided on Netflix and Hulu. 'We don't necessarily know what approach will work, and we don't necessarily know what approach won't work,' noted Nancy Tellem, the president of Xbox Entertainment Studios during a recent press preview of Xbox Originals at Microsoft's offices in Santa Monica, California. Ms Tellem, who previously was president of CBS Entertainment, said no decisions have been made as to how each Xbox series will be available — either as part of the Xbox Live subscription, for sale individually or available for free through advertising partnerships. She said an Xbox Originals app would be added to the consoles' user interface, and each new Xbox series might be differently distributed. Among the shows coming to Xbox this year are the street soccer docu-series 'Every Street United,' which will be the first to debut in July, and the six-part tech-centric documentary series 'Signal to Noise.' The first installment — 'Atari: Game Over; — chronicles this past weekend's excavation of a landfill thought to be filled with copies of Atari's infamous 'E.T.' game.","First original series will be comedies titled Other Space and Sin City Saints .

"By . Sophie Borland . Hundreds of babies may be dying on NHS labour wards every year due to a severe lack of staff, a top doctor has warned. Dr David Richmond, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said it was ‘legitimate’ to ask whether it was the reason for notoriously high rates of mortality and brain damage. Figures show that 300 babies die a year during birth or shortly after with a further 1,200 suffering brain damage or other major health problems. Deaths: Dr Richmond said many mothers are still 'losing their babies unnecessarily' At the same time NHS maternity wards remain desperately understaffed and cannot cope with the baby boom coupled with births becoming more complicated due to older and more obese women. Dr Richmond, who represents Britain’s 6,000 obstetricians, said: ‘We need to look at the possibility that understaffing, labour wards that are under pressure and busy, and stretched facilities may be a factor in some of these poor outcomes.’ He added that there were occasions when staff made ‘small, relatively innocuous mistakes [which], when combined, lead to a disaster.’ Dr Richmond also criticised Britain’s high rate of stillbirth – almost 4,000 a year or about 10 a day – as an ‘appalling’ and largely preventable loss of life. It is the third highest rate out of 35 high income countries – only France and Austria are worse. He said that although the numbers have fallen recently, ‘it’s still a lot of mums in the 21st century that are losing their babies unnecessarily.’ And figures for 2009 – the latest year available – showed that 144 babies died during labour with a further 134 dying within a week of the birth. The birth rate in Britain has risen by 22 per cent in the last decade and Dr Richmond said maternity units were being ‘squeezed’ because the numbers of doctors and nurses has not kept pace. He said there needed to be an extra 800 consultants to provide care round the clock and intervene when complications arise during the labour. 'Squeezed': Dr Richmond said the number of doctors and nurses has not kept pace with the rising birth rate . ‘If you need to have a consultant there at three in the afternoon, why is it not equally important to have a consultant there at three o’clock in the morning? In my view it is,’ he told the Guardian. But he admitted that a lack of NHS funding meant there was no realistic realistic possibility of consultant numbers rising from 2,200 to the ideal of 3,000. He also called for action to reduce the 1,200 ‘near misses’ which occur every year when complications occur during labour and birth that often leave the baby temporarily but dangerously deprived of oxygen. The condition, which doctors call ‘severely hypoxic,’ involves babies facing the risk of brain damage and profound lifelong disability. ‘These are babies that are born in very poor condition and may have a very slow heartbeat or very restricted breathing or not respond to stimulation,’ he said. Dr Richmond said: 'Lots and lots of women travel through pregnancy and labour safely but occasional tragedy occurs' Each such case can leave the NHS having to find millions of pounds in compensation to pay for the substantial cost of providing lifetime care for the child. He said the loss of life and long term injuries that resulted from these complications represent ‘1,500 individual tragedies’ and constitute ‘an ongoing tragedy involving potentially avoidable very serious outcomes.’ Asked why the baby deaths occur, Richmond replied: “The best analogy is to describe them as plane crashes. ‘Lots and lots of women travel through pregnancy and labour safely but occasional tragedy occurs. 'These tragedies are always ‘multifactorial’ and require thorough investigation to establish why. It is not uncommon that a series of small relatively innocuous mistakes, when combined, lead to a disaster,’ he said. ‘There are often no easy fixes. The challenge is to be willing to share these experiences, learn from each other and invest in safety. ‘There is a big difference: flights are often cancelled for safety reasons – medical emergencies during pregnancy and labour can’t be cancelled.’ In addition to the lack of doctors, the Royal College of Midwives has estimated the NHS needs an extra 5,000 midwives to guarantee safe care. Dr Dan Poulter, the health minister, said childbirth on the NHS was safe and perinatal mortality was declining. ‘The numbers of stillbirths and infant mortalities are at the lowest levels since 1993, but there is still more to do. 'The NHS is a safe place to give birth, with women reporting high levels of trust and confidence in staff.’","Dr David Richmond, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criticised the death rate in Britain's hospitals .

"By . Emma Innes . A cystic fibrosis patient has married his girlfriend after having a successful lung transplant. Dane Pollard, 34, was diagnosed with the condition when he was 18 months old and feared he would not survive. The condition caused his lungs to fill with mucus, meaning he needed daily physiotherapy in order to lead a normal life. Dane Pollard met and married his partner, Emma, after his life was saved by a last minute lung transplant . Mr Pollard was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when he was 18 months old and his health slowly deteriorated . However, his health worsened and he found himself needing a wheelchair and additional oxygen. He eventually ended up housebound and was put on the lung transplant list. In 2008, he received a call to say that some new lungs had been found for him and the operation could go ahead. He believes that if the lungs had not become available, he would not have survived for many more days. Since the surgery, Mr Pollard, from Manchester, has met his partner, Emma, 33, and the couple married earlier this month. Mr Pollard, a songwriter, said: 'Before I had the transplant I couldn’t even leave the house. Mr Pollard (pictured when he was very ill) was housebound by the time he reached his late 20s . 'I can’t believe how lucky I was to not only get my lung transplant, but then to go on to meet the woman of my dreams. 'Without the transplant I almost certainly wouldn’t have survived and gone on to meet Emma. 'We got married at Manchester Register Office before heading to Barcelona for a second, bigger wedding. 'The transplant came just in time for me. It’s fantastic to be able to live the life I want to and to be able to celebrate our special day.' Mr Pollard started going out about one year after his transplant and met his future wife in January 2010. Mr Pollard (pictured on his wedding day) believes he was just days from death when he got a call to say a pair of lungs had become available for him . Mr Pollard had the transplant but it was a year before he was well enough to start going out and meeting people again. When he had recovered, he met his partner, Emma . He said: 'Requiring oxygen and help to get around made it very difficult to leave the house. 'The emotional and psychological aspect of recovery from my transplant meant it took me a while to integrate myself back into society. 'It was a struggle after being ill and housebound for some time prior. 'But after about a year I felt well enough to start going out and meeting new people. 'It is difficult to tell people that you’ve had a transplant - some people run a mile - but Emma’s cousin’s wife suffers from CF so she was very understanding.' The couple got engaged in January 2013 in Barcelona. Mr Pollard (pictured as a baby) said: 'I can't believe how lucky I was to not only get my lung transplant, but then to go on to meet the woman of my dream' Mr Pollard (pictured as a child) said: 'Without the transplant I almost certainly wouldn't have survived and gone on to meet Emma' Project manager Mrs Pollard said: 'Dane did everything properly - he asked my parents two days before we went away and took the ring with us. 'But then on the night nothing went to plan. It was New Year’s Eve and we were closed into the main square. 'Dane ended up proposing next to a bin - I’ll never let him forget that.'Mr Pollard, whose band is called Modern Sound Library, has written a song dedicated to his donor and hopes to raise funds for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. Mr Pollard (pictured with his wife on their wedding day) is encouraging people to join the organ donor register . Mr Pollard (pictured with his wife) believes people should be able to opt out of being an organ donor, rather than having to opt in if they want their organs to be considered for donation . It is called Thank You and will feature backing vocals from other CF suffers. He hopes to raise awareness of the condition and encourage more people to join the organ donation register. He said: 'It should be made easier for people to have the transplants that they need. I believe that people should have to opt out of being a donor instead of opting in.' Ed Owen, the Cystic Fibrosis Trust's chief executive, said: 'We are calling on all bodies responsible for transplantation policy to work with us and act on our recommendations to ensure those waiting for a transplant get the organs they so desperately need and to bring new hope to their lives.' Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition which causes the lungs and the digestive system to become clogged with mucus. Symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough, recurring chest infections and failure to thrive. As the condition develops, a lung transplant may be required. There is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long-term damage caused by infections. The most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs, and antibiotics to treat infections. The condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build-up of mucus. For a child to inherit the condition, both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene. In this situation, there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes, a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer, and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition. About one in every 2,500 babies born in the UK are born with cystic fibrosis. As treatments have improved, the outlook for these children has improved dramatically. But, life expectancy remains in the 40s. Source: NHS Choices .","Dane Pollard, 34, was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at 18 months old .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Frozen: Neuroscientists have discovered exactly how the brain links its survival circuits to the spinal cord, causing the body to freeze . Fear is primitive. In the wild, it instinctively protects animals from predators - but for humans, the emotion can be far more complex. Fear can trigger the 'fight or flight' response to raise the heart rate, sharpen the senses and provide access to huge amounts of energy in order to cope with threats to survival. At times, the threat is so intense it can cause a 'freeze' response. This could be interpreted as the brain being overwhelmed, or it may have evolved as a way of keeping still to hide from predators. Now neuroscientists have discovered exactly how the brain links its survival circuits to the spinal cord, causing the body to freeze in the face of danger. The discovery could help develop effective treatments for emotional disorders such as anxiety, panic attacks and phobias. Scientists know that memories are learned and stored in a small structure in the brain known as the amygdala. Any disturbing event activates neurons in the lateral and then central portions of the amygdala. The signals are then communicated internally, passing from one group of neurons to the next. From there, they reach neurons in the brainstem, the action centre for fear responses. Researchers believe something known as the periaqueductal gray (PAG) can trigger responses such as freezing, a high heart rate, increase in blood pressure and the desire for flight or fight. The discovery could help develop effective treatments for emotional disorders such as anxiety, panic attacks and phobias. Nicole Kidman (pictured) is known to suffer from panic attacks . The study by Bristol University has discovered a brain pathway leading from the PAG to a part of the cerebellum – a region of the brain that controls motion - named the pyramis. The research went on to show that the pyramis is involved in generating freezing behaviour when someone faces danger. ‘There is a growing consensus that understanding the neural circuits underlying fear behaviour is a fundamental step towards developing effective treatments for behavioural changes associated with emotional disorders,’ said Dr Stella Koutsikou at the University of Bristol. Professor Bridget Lumb, Professor of Systems Neuroscience, added: ‘Our work introduces the novel concept that the cerebellum is a promising target for therapeutic strategies to manage dysregulation of emotional states such as panic disorders and phobias.’ Panic attack: Psychologists have said that humans have an innate response to danger that alerts our bodies before our cognitive brain has processed the threat .","Brain region known as periaqueductal gray (PAG) can trigger responses such as freezing, a .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Google revolutionised the tablet market with its low-cost, high-specification Nexus 7 devices - and if the latest rumours are to be believed, the firm may be hoping to do the same in the mid-sized tablet market. Potentially quashing recent reports Google was looking to abandon the Nexus project entirely, these new rumours suggest a device called Nexus 8 will launch later this year - and it could be made by HTC. Google is said to have approached HTC when it originally began building its Nexus range back in 2012, but the Taiwanese firm was too busy with its smartphones so Google is believed to have teamed up with Asus instead. Reports claim Google is looking to team up with HTC to launch an 8-inch, or even 8.9-inch device, by September.

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple has reported profits of $10.2bn after selling 43.7 million iPhones it its latest quarter - but admitted a dramatic slide in iPad sales. The firm's latest results reveal iPad sales slipped 16 percent from last year to about 16.4 million tablets - although it says the drop is down to 'inventory issues'. As part of its financial results It also announced plans to buy an additional $30bn of its stock back from shareholders and to increase its quarterly dividend by 8%, as well as a seven-for-one stock split in early June. Scroll down for video . Apple Inc has approved another $30 billion in share buybacks till the end of 2015 and authorized a rarely seen seven-for-one stock split, addressing calls to share more of its cash hoard while broadening the stock's appeal to individual investors. Apple's stock price over the last five years: The firm has faced fears the death of co-founder Steve Jobs would stall innovation. However, Apple's stock soared by nearly 8 percent in extended trading after the latest results came out. Analysts projected iPad sales would reach 19.7 million, an only marginal increase from the 19.5 million iPads sold during the same time period in 2013. In fact, Apple sold 16.35 million iPads, a drop of roughly 16.4 percent since last year. The moves are meant to appease investors as the firm reports slowing revenue growth.Revenue was $45.6bn, a 4.6% increase from the same period a year ago. 'We're very proud of our quarterly results, especially our strong iPhone sales and record revenue from services,' said chief executive Tim Cook in a statement. He also hinted the firm still had major product announcement to come this year. 'We’re eagerly looking forward to introducing more new products and services that only Apple could bring to market.' The firm is rumoured to be introducing its iWatch and possible a new version of its Apple TV in June. Tim Cook revealed the firm's current TV box is selling well,' he said. 'We've now sold about 20m Apple TVs. 'We've got a pretty large install base there. 'I'm feeling quite good about that business and where it can go. Apple also plans to buy back an additional $30 billion of its stock, raise its quarterly dividend by 8 percent and split its stock for the first time in nine years. The commitment announced Wednesday as part of Apple's fiscal second-quarter earnings report expands on the company's previous pledge to spend $60 billion on stock buybacks by the end of next year. The company is now earmarking $90 billion for buybacks during that time frame. Apple Inc. also is raising its quarterly dividend to $3.29 per share as part its effort to funnel more money to stockholders. The company also will execute an unusual seven-for-one stock split in early June. The move will dramatically decrease the nominal value of Apple's stock, which closed Wednesday at $524.75, though the total value of the company shouldn't change from the split. Apple's stock soared by nearly 8 percent in extended trading after the news came out. The firm's latest results reveal iPad sales slipped 16 percent from last year to about 16.4 million tablets. The slowdown in revenue growth has prompted investors to wonder whether the company has lost its innovative power since the death of Steve Jobs. The results for the first three months of the year illustrated how Apple Inc. can afford to spend so much money on its own stock. Apple's earnings rose 7 percent to $10.2 billion, or $11.62 per share, an amount that exceeds what most technology companies make in an entire year. Revenue climbed by 5 percent to $45.6 billion. The Cupertino, Calif., company's quarterly revenue growth has been stuck between 1 percent and 6 percent for the past year. Investors have been worried about the future of Apple since Jobs, its co-founder and chief visionary, died in October 2011. The firm has turned some of its stores green to mark yesterday's Earth Day . Those worries have been compounded by the fierce competition that Apple faces in the mobile device market, particularly from Samsung Electronics Co. The company's stock price has been about 25 percent below its peak of $705.07 reached 19 months ago. The shares rose to $564.83 in Wednesday's extending trading, after closing earlier at $524.75. 10.6-inches . 1920 x 1080 . 208 . 5MP rear, 1.2MP front . 1MP rear-facing, HD front-facing . 16GB . 64GB .

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . John Terry placed the ball on the spot, smacked it past Mark Schwarzer into the top corner and his whoop of delight cut through the leafy tranquility of the Surrey stockbroker belt where Chelsea train. This time last week, Terry feared his season might be over, cut short by a twisted ankle during the  goalless first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Atletico Madrid. On Tuesday, he was declared fit by Jose Mourinho, but the manager did not stop there. He also told how his captain had unfinished business in this competition and declared his form to be as good as ever. VIDEO Scroll down for Chelsea captain John Terry: I feel as though I owe football . Captain. Leader. Legend: John Terry has been declared fit for the Champions League semi-final . Unbreakable: Terry returned to training ahead of schedule as Chelsea prepare to face Atletico Madrid . Leader of the pack: Terry has stated that he would like to finish his playing career at Stamford Bridge . In return, Terry ruled out the notion of an England return and pledged his future to Chelsea beyond the end of a contract which is about to run out. ‘It’s the club I’ve been at since 14, and I’ve been nowhere else,’ said the 33-year-old centre half. ‘I want to stay here for the rest of my footballing days. We’re in talks. ‘We’ve had big games, so we haven’t spoken for a few weeks, but I hope it gets done. It’s down to the club but I want to stay and I hope something gets sorted out.’ He credits Mourinho with reviving a career which was drifting last  season, when injuries, suspensions and the tactical preferences of Rafa Benitez combined to leave him a peripheral figure at the club he joined from school. ‘A lot of people in football ruled me out a bit last year, thinking I wouldn’t be here for too much longer,’ said Terry. ‘That spurs you on to do well and battle for the club you love. Whether that’s a year, two years, three years, I feel I have something to give next year. Beyond that, we don’t know. I hope so. Raf justice! The Chelsea captain was written off after being dropped by Rafael Benitez in the last campaign . Fountain of youth? Terry has credited Jose Mourinho (R) with reviving his career this season . 'The manager has played a massive part for me. We spoke in the summer once his deal was done. He’s very honest. He lets you know straight. If you’re not good enough, you won’t play. If you’re playing well, you keep your place.’ The feeling is mutual. It was Mourinho who brought up Terry’s horrible histories in European finals — a missed penalty in 2008 in  Moscow, suspension four years later in Munich and an injury last year which ruled him out of the Europa League final in Amsterdam — and suggested it was time for the Champions League to repay him. ‘My captain is playing at the same level he was playing when I left Chelsea in 2007, as simple as that,’ said Mourinho. ‘Seven years later, he’s playing again at his best. ‘It’s also fair to say that the  people who surround him, the  people playing on his left and right, in front of him, are also playing  fantastically. His partnership with Gary Cahill is fantastic. ‘I’m really happy to see a player like him, six or seven years later, to be back to the same level. He deserves more than the Champions League has given him up to now. Potential banana skin! terry famously slipped as he missed a decisive penalty in the 2008 Champions League final . Gatecrasher: Injury kept Terry out of the 2012 final, although he donned his kit for the celebrations . ‘He lost a few semi-finals in special circumstances. He lost a final also in special circumstances. He won a final in special  circumstances because he couldn’t play. I think the Champions League owes him something.’ Terry, sitting beside his manager, welled up slightly. He said for many years he kept the shirt from the Moscow final on the wall in his home and used it as motivation but it has been in storage since he sold his mansion. ‘When we won it I took it down,’ he said. ‘It went into the loft and another one replaced it. Disappointing memories, but when you go on to win it, happy memories tend to outweigh those.’ As for the Munich final, in 2012, when he was ridiculed for pulling on his kit to join in the post-match celebrations, he was also able to laugh. ‘It did mean a lot to me that night, playing or not playing,’ said Terry. ‘I felt I contributed. So did other players who didn’t get as much stick as me. That’s a different story. Man of steel: The 33-year-old squares up to Chelsea target Diego Costa during the first leg in Madrid . In good hands: There were fears Terry would not play again this season after limping out of the first game . ‘Throughout that campaign, I had surgery on my knee before the Napoli game and came back really quickly, scored a goal and played a part. I did have a big part to play in the dressing room and on the field of play as well. ‘Those winning moments live with you, those moments when you get your hands on the trophy, particularly when you’re in a difficult period personally and professionally. Those memories tend to spur you on.’ He underwent intensive  treatment through the week to get himself in shape to lead the team out against Atletico in tonight’s second leg and is ready to take a penalty if the game goes that way. It very well might. Neither of these sides concedes often. It will be tense and nervous; a clash of teams who prefer to be without the ball, anxious not to make the first slip. Who has the biggest bus? Atletico, with Chelsea’s on-loan goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois set to make his debut at Stamford Bridge, have not conceded in six games. Neymar was the last man to beat Courtois when he equalised for Barcelona in the first leg of the quarter-final on April 1. Chelsea have kept five clean sheets out of the last six. Blues brothers: Eden Hazard and Samuel Eto'o could both return from injury to play a part in the big game . In safe hands? Petr Cech returned to training but reserve Mark Schwarzer (L) is expected to play on Wednesday . Take a bow: Thibaut Courtois is set for an unusual debut at Stamford Bridge... in goal for the opposition . ‘I hope I can guarantee the home fans a win,’ said Terry. ‘I can’t promise an attractive one. The most important thing is to win. As a footballer, there’s no better feeling.’ It was no surprise to see the  Chelsea players practising from 12 yards but they will be without  No 1 goalkeeper Petr Cech, despite a game of bluff yesterday. Cech, who dislocated a shoulder in the first leg last week, trotted out for training, smiling and  claiming he was fit, but as he limbered up it soon became clear he was not and he went off to work alone. Mark Schwarzer will  continue in goal, but Mourinho has Samuel Eto’o, Eden Hazard and Terry fit after injury.","John Terry is fit to play in Chelsea's Champions League semi-final .

Twitter has also added filters to control what kind of tweets appear, including tweets with photos and tweets with replies. 'Today, the new web profile experience is rolling out to all users around the world,' the firm said. Some users have had a number of these features - namely the new header and profile image - for a while, during Twitter's testing phase, while others will not be familiar with them. ‘Moment by moment, your Twitter profile shows the world who you are,’ explained Twitter designer David Bellona in a blog post. ‘Starting today, it will be even easier (and, we think, more fun) to express yourself through a new and improved web profile.’ The new look lets users add a larger profile picture, customise their header image, and highlight their best tweets - all features similar to those found on Facebook. Tweets that have received the most retweets, interactions or favourites now appear larger on a person’s profile, making popular content easier to find. New users will see the updated profile design straight away and it will be rolled out to current users 'in the coming weeks'. Notable tweeters to already have the new look, in addition to Michelle Obama, include Channing Tatum, pictured, and John Legend . The new design follows a number of changes. In March, for example, Twitter posted a blog announcing a new range of photo options. Users can now add up to four pictures in each tweet. The firm also added the ability to tag up to ten friends in a photo, without using up any of the tweets 140 characters . Users can also now pin tweets to the top of their profile, that act in a similar way to Facebook status updates, to show ‘followers what you’re all about’. Facebook has a similar 'Highlight' feature that members use to promote certain posts, or make photo posts larger, for example. Finally, Twitter has introduced Filtered Tweets meaning users can choose which timeline to view when checking out people’s profiles. Earlier this year, Twitter rolled out the new design to select users and it was criticised for closely resembling how Facebook profiles look. Images are larger, while text-based tweets are made smaller, and where appropriate, cards are positioned in columns similar to Facebook's Highlights profile design, pictured . During testing of this redesign, the photos and videos box on the old left-hand panel was removed and a new category tab was created on individual profiles to showcase this content. These now appear to have been a precursor to the latest filters, pictured . Filters include tweets, tweets with photos or videos, and tweets with replies.

"By . Carol Driver . Unwell: Tim Warner claims he contracted cholera after staying in a three-star hotel in Tunisia . A holidaymaker is launching legal action against a travel company claiming his break to Tunisia was ruined after he contracted cholera. Tim Warner was on a romantic getaway with his partner Amanda Dworak when he claims to have been hit by the infection, which is usually confined to Third World countries. The 47-year-old alleges he suffered diarrhoea throughout the £1,488, 12-day break at the Sol Azur Hotel, and was doubled over in pain throughout the trip. Mr Warner . believed it to be food poisoning but visited a doctor when the symptoms . continued after he returned home to be diagnosed with cholera - a . bacterial infection caused by eating food which has been in contact with . faeces. The architect, from Telford, Shropshire, said the first thing the couple noticed when they arrived at the three-star hotel in September 2013, was the smell of 'raw sewage'. 'We . arrived in the middle of the night, and the first thing we noticed was . the smell of raw sewage - it was absolutely unbelievable,' he said. 'Halfway . through the holiday we'd had enough and the travel rep, to their . credit, moved us to the other side of the complex so the sea wind would . waft it away. 'Even then, when we went down to the pool area, we had to pinch our noses with our finger and thumb.' Mr Warned also claimed that part-way through the holiday, which was booked with Thomas Cook, the hotel's all-inclusive restaurant had to be closed. But he claims by then he had already fallen unwell. Bad smell: The couple claim the three-star Sol Azur Hotel smelled of raw sewage when they arrived . Holiday resort: The Sol Azur Hotel where Mr Warner claims he contracted cholera while on holiday . 'After a few days we got back and I still felt ill so went to the doctors,' Mr Warner said. 'They took a stool sample, and a week later told me I had cholera - I was utterly gobsmacked. 'When I went back, the doctor told me the fact I was able to visit him a week previous that I was through the worst. 'I remember him saying if I was going to die, I would have done so by then.'The couple contacted Thomas Cook but said they were unhappy with the tour operator's response, and as such have launched civil action through solicitors Slater & Gordon. Tim said: 'Thomas Cook tried to tell us nobody else had complained about being ill, but we knew of at least six more people were hit by the bacteria. Popular resort: Hammamet beach in Tunisia, near to where the couple stayed . 'Even if they didn't complain to the travel operator, everybody was talking about it around the pool. 'The hotel was without doubt the worst I've ever had the misfortune of staying in.' Mark Montaldo, specialist travel lawyer with Slater & Gordon, said: 'This was meant to be a relaxing and romantic getaway but instead the holiday was ruined when Tim was left severely ill with a potentially life threatening illness. 'The accommodation for the guests was clearly not of an acceptable standard which ultimately resulted in Tim becoming very ill. 'The cholera not only ruined the holiday but has already left him with a severe case of irritable bowel syndrome which persists to this day and is making his life very difficult. 'It is simply unacceptable that any holidaymaker should have to suffer this way.'A spokeswoman for Thomas Cook said: 'The health and safety of our customers is always our primary concern, so we were naturally very concerned to hear that Mr Warner became unwell while he was on holiday with us. 'As we are in the process of liaising directly with Mr Warner's legal representative in relation to this, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time so as not to unduly influence any possible future legal proceedings.' Only 12 cases of cholera were reported in England and Wales in 2012 and the last major outbreak seen in Europe claimed 250,000 lives between 1881 and 1896.","Tim Warner claims he fell ill while staying at the Sol Azur Hotel .

"Only . By . Mark Prigg . A new app called Peppr was launched in Germany this month to connect potential clients with nearby prostitutes using their phone's GPS capabilities. It is described as  a cross between the car-ordering service app Uber and the dating app Tinder. Clients log into the app and type in what they want: body type, eye color, personality traits, and the maximum price they are willing to pay. Scroll down for video . Traditionally sex workers relied on cards in phone boxes - but now they have an app that can connect them with clients . Clients log into the app and type in what they want: body type, eye color, personality traits, and the maximum price they are willing to pay. It then uses GPS to match them with nearby sex workers, who must be independent sex workers and pass an interview. Pia Poppenreiter, the creator of the app, says she wanted to create a tool that prevented sex workers from waiting in the cold to find clients. Poppenreiter says she pre-interviews people who wish to use the app to make sure they are working voluntarily and independently in the business. 'We have a short conversation to get the feeling that this is voluntary and they are independent sex workers,' she said. 'We try to ask them - you kind of find out in a conversation whether they're doing it on a voluntary basis - we ask them what they did before, whether they've always worked voluntarily and so on.' Pia says she came up with the idea after seeing sex workers out on the streets. 'The story always sounds corny, but it's true,' she told German start-up magazine Grunderszene.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A second man has been charged with the murder and kidnapping of Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo, who went missing on the morning of April 2011. Jason Wayne Autry, who was already in prison on separate charges, was indicted today over the case of the missing student, who was last seen by her brother being led into woods at their home. The 39-year-old is a longtime friend of Zachary Adams, who was also charged with her kidnap and murder in March. Scroll down for video . Suspect: Jason Wayne Autry has been charged with the kidnap and murder of Holly Bobo . Missing: Nursing student Holly Bobo disappeared in April 2011. A body was never found but police believe she was murdered . Police said they expected to make further arrests in the three-year-old case, after finding new leads and evidence. At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Tennesse Bureau of Investigation director Mark Gwyn said they had sworn statements from witnesses who claim to have seen Miss Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after she had been reported missing. He added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses. 'We believe other individuals have knowledge, and possibly others have involvement,' Mr Gwyn told News Channel 5. 'They can expect us to be on their doorsteps very soon.' He added: 'This is a case the TBI has been continuously working hard to solve now for three years. It has not been easy but I do know truth will prevail.' Charged: Zachary Adams, left, and Jason Wayne Autry, right, are suspected of kidnapping and killing Holly Bobo . Threats: Adams appears in court Tuesday over claims he threatened his brother, who is a witness in the case . Connection: Autry, who is currently serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault, is described as a long-time friend of Adams . 'Anyone who had anything to do with Holly's disappearance will be brought to justice,' he added. The first major break in the case came in February, when the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents and FBI searched several areas around Decatur, including the home of Zachary Adams. Adams, 29, was arrested and charged with kidnapping and murder shortly afterwards. Miss Bobo's body has never been found. Adams appeared in court Tuesday on charges of coercion of a witness after allegedly making threats to his brother who is due to testify against him. Adams' brother allegedly told the FBI he had seen Miss Bobo, 20, alive at his home after she was reported missing. Loss: Nursing student Holly Bobo was seen being led from her Tennessee home in April 2011 . Heartbroken: Holly's mom Karen Bobo is led into court by attorney Steve Farase in March, when Adams was charged with her murder and kidnap . Adams is accused of asking a fellow inmate to tell his brother: 'He's the one who started this s*** and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her,' CBS News reported. Autry, 39, has been indicted with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree felony murder. He is already in prison serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault. He is due to be arraigned Wednesday. The case about Miss Bobo's disappearance is still active. Prosecutors are considering seeking the death penalty if they get a conviction in the case.","Jason Wayne Autry is named as second suspect in killing of 20-year-old .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . All iPhone owners in America will soon be able to get their screens replaced at Apple stores rather than sending them away to specialty repair shops, according to reports from a U.S technology site. MacRumours claims that if an Apple customer drops their iPhone and the . screen cracks, they can now take the phone to a local Apple Genius bar which will replace the screen for around £97 ($149). Previously only AppleCare+ customers could have their displays fixed by Apple. Cracking up: At the moment, owners who do not sign up to AppleCare+ are looking at a hefty bill if they crack their iPhone screens . During a drop test by Well, according to a video by phone insurers SquareTrade, the iPhone 5 was more sturdy than the Samsung Galaxy S3. In the first test, both phones were dropped from the same height. The iPhone 5 suffered small scratches while the S3’s screen smashed. The company then dropped household items onto the devices including a bottle of wine. The S3's screen smashed on impact whereas the iPhone 5 survived. Other customers would have had to take their phones to expert repair stores, or send the phone away for an online repair, paying on average between £120 ($180) and £146 ($225) to get the devices fixed. And if a third-party fixed the screen, the customer's warranty could be affected. Apple hasn't confirmed the plans but a number of customers have told MacRumours, and other sources including Cult of Mac, that they have had their screen replaced instore. It is also unclear whether the service will launch in the UK. When the iPhone 4 was announced, Steve Jobs claimed the display had been made stronger than previous models. He added it was 'ultra-durable and more scratch resistant than ever'. However, in an independent drop test, technology site T3 managed to crack the device's screen by only dropping the phone four times. The Genius Bars in Apple stores already provide technical support for customers and now, according to technology site MacRumours, they will soon be able to offer screen repairs. Apple has not confirmed the plans and it is unclear whether the service will launch in the UK . The design of the iPhone 4 and 4S also made it difficult for the screen to be replaced. Apple's iPhone 5 was launched as being even more scratch- and crack-resistant. Yet in drop tests the device's screen still smashed on the fifth attempt. The iPhone 5, however, has been redesigned to make it easier to remove a cracked screen and slide in a new one. The reports about Apple's iPhone screen replacement service did not specify whether all models, or just more recent handsets, would qualify.","Reports on Apple rumour sites claim that U.S customers are getting their screens replaced at Apple Genius bars for around £97 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . An ancient wine cellar, believed to be the oldest discovered so far, has been uncovered by a team of U.S. and Israeli archaeologists. The cellar, found among the ruins of a palace in Tel Kabri, Israel, dates back almost 4,000 years. It contains 40 amphorae-like jars, which each held 50 litres of sweet wine - and the residue left inside hints at the recipe enjoyed at the time. These 3,700-year-old jars were discovered in an ancient palatial wine cellar unearthed by researchers at Tel Kabri.  The team worked in day and night shifts to excavate a total of 40 intact vessels during its six week dig . The team of international experts believe the 2,000 litres of fine wine was made by ancient Canaanites in 1,700 B.C. who flavoured the wine with cinnamon, mint, honey and psychotropic resins. Professor Eric Cline, chair of the department of classical and near eastern languages and civilisations at the university, said the team first came across a three foot long jug, which they named ‘Bessie’. ‘We dug and dug, and all of a sudden, Bessie’s friends started appearing-five, 10, 15, ultimately 40 jars packed in a 15-by-25-foot storage room,’ he said. ‘This is a hugely significant discovery - it’s a wine cellar that, to our knowledge, is largely unmatched in age and size.’ The group made the discovery at the 75-acre Tel Kabri site in Israel - the ruins of a northern Canaanite city - and said the cellar held the equivalent of 3,000 of today’s bottles of red and white wine. The cellar, found among the ruins of a palace in Tel Kabri, Israel, dates back almost 4,000 years. It contains 40 amphorae-like jars, which each held 50 litres of sweet wine, although only residue remains . The wine (residue) discovered was made by ancient Canaanites in 1,700 B.C. It was flavoured with cinnamon, mint, honey and psychotropic resins, which can act on the central nervous system to affect brain function. Psychoactive ingredients have been used throughout history to alter one's consciousness, for ritual spiritual purposes and as anesthetics. A scientist also found traces of tartaric and syringic acid, which are both key components in wine. The recipe was similar to medicinal wines used in ancient Egypt for two thousand years. Dr Andrew Koh, assistant professor of classical studies at Brandeis University, near Boston, analysed the residue found inside the jars to identify what they were originally used for. He found traces of tartaric and syringic acid, which are both key components in wine. Dr Koh also discovered compounds suggesting ingredients popular in ancient wine-making, including honey, mint, cinnamon bark, juniper berries and resins. The recipe is similar to medicinal wines used in ancient Egypt for two thousand years. He said: ‘This wasn’t moonshine that someone was brewing in their basement, eyeballing the measurements. ‘This wine’s recipe was strictly followed in each and every jar.’ The team of international experts believe . the 2,000 litres of fine wine, was made by ancient Canaanites in 1,700 . B.C. who flavoured the wine with cinnamon (pictured left), mint, (right) honey and psychotropic . resins. They are analysing wine residues in a bid to recreate the recipe . Researchers will continue to analyse the composition of each solution and hope to recreate the flavour of the ancient wine. Dr Assaf Yasur-Landau, chair of the department of maritime civilisations at the University of Haifa, said the wine would have been drunk by important guests. ‘The wine cellar was located near a hall where banquets took place, a place where the Kabri elite and possibly foreign guests consumed goat meat and wine,’ he said. ‘The wine cellar and the banquet hall were destroyed during the same violent event, perhaps an earthquake, which covered them with thick debris of mud bricks and plaster.’ The team also discovered two doors leading out of the cellar to the south and the west that may lead to additional storage rooms. They will present their findings so far at the annual meeting of the American Schools of Oriental Research.","A team of U.S. and Israeli archaeologists discovered 40 jars in a ruined palace in Tel Kabri, Israel, which date back almost 4,000 years.

"By . Dan Bloom . A teacher handed police shocking secret footage which allegedly shows two colleagues slapping and choking a special needs student before knocking him off a chair. The video was filmed at Harper-Archer Middle School in Atlanta, Georgia, over four days by a teacher who claimed the principal did not act on her complaints. Classroom aide Alger Coleman, 42, was arrested and charged with child cruelty and simple battery. Scroll down for video . Attack: Shocking secret footage allegedly shows two classroom aides assaulting a student in Atlanta . Action: One aide has been criminally charged and another has been reassigned outside the classroom . 'I was shocked, outraged and you have to add profoundly disappointed,' said Atlanta Public Schools Superintendent Erroll Davis told CBS 46. 'We are looking into all of the communications that took place'. According to the Atlanta Police Department, the video was shot by teacher Tori Jackson-Reynolds. It appears to show Coleman, and another female aide alleged to be Keisha Smith, repeatedly physically abusing two boys. One shocking section shows an aide smack one of the boys in the head so hard he falls out of his chair. Charged: Classroom aide Alger Coleman . After the boy gets back up, he is put in a choke hold and slapped again. The video was recorded in February and police were alerted last month. The Atlanta Police Department incident report, seen by MailOnline, said: 'Mrs Jackson-Reynolds stated that she was appalled at the unprofessional behavior of her paraprofessional (being lazy and unattentive to students' needs). 'To document the staff's behavior she placed a video recording device in the classroom for several days. Mrs. Jackson-Reynolds gave me a copy on the video, which we reviewed together. 'While reviewing the video I observed a black male which Mrs Jackson-Reynolds referred to as Mr Al Coleman slap [a pupil] several times and place him in a wrestling type choke hold. 'Seconds after the slapping 'Mr Coleman' slapped [the pupil] again with enough force to knock him out of his seat.' The report said the officer phoned the boy's mother, who said she was aware of the allegations, her son had not been injured and she was reluctant to press charges, saying: 'I know my son is a handful and I don't want to jump to any conclusion before I watch the video.' But after viewing it, she agreed to press charges. Coleman was arrested at his home south of Atlanta after police broke down his door. Ms Smith was not criminally charged, and was instead reassigned outside the classroom pending a disciplinary hearing. But Kimberly Green, spokesman for Atlanta Public Schools, told MailOnline today Ms Smith resigned this week before the hearing could take place. 'She's no longer with the school district,' she said. 'She has resigned as of April 28.' The mother of one of the children, aged just 11, broke down in tears when shown the secret footage by WSBTV. Allegations: The focus is on Harper-Archer Middle School in Atlanta, Georgia . She said: 'I was heartbroken, I was very heartbroken... I really couldn't believe the school would let this go on.' She added the second classroom aide should face criminal charges. 'I want them charged today, yes today', she said. She also thanked the 'Good Samaritan' teacher who made the footage. Atlanta Public Schools issued a statement when the footage was made public last week. It said: 'Atlanta Public Schools can confirm that Alger Coleman is no longer with the district. 'The safety and security of our students remain a top priority for Atlanta Public Schools. 'The . district takes all complaints seriously and reporting behavior that is . harmful to our students is everyone's responsibility.'","Teacher filmed alleged abuse by colleagues at a middle school in Atlanta .

"By . Jaya Narain . If the prisoner was trying  to wind up the police officer  who was driving him to a  custody cell 50 miles away,  he succeeded – spectacularly. For after being repeatedly asked how fast the high-performance police car would go, PC Barry Evans put his foot down – and drove at speeds of up to 140mph. But when he delivered the suspect to their destination, the prisoner reported him to the desk officer. Caught: The Pc's 140mph speeding was reported by his criminal passenger when the pair arrived at Darlington Police Station (pictured) Now PC Evans has been stripped of . driving duties and a row has broken out after senior officers said he . would not be prosecuted despite the offence ordinarily carrying a . driving ban. The constable . from Durham Police was driving the prisoner, who had been arrested on . suspicion of theft, from Leeds back to Darlington in a marked police BMW . 330. In trouble: The driver sped for part of the journey between Leeds and Darlington and the prisoner promptly informed a custody officer when he arrived . A source said: ‘The . conversation turned to the vehicle they were travelling in. Apparently . the prisoner asked how fast it would go and the officer said something . along the lines of, “I’ll show you”, or, “Let’s see”. As soon as they . got back to Darlington, the prisoner proceeded to tell the officer at . the custody desk just how fast they had been going.’ Road . safety campaigners condemned the decision not to prosecute. The law . allows police, ambulance and fire service drivers to exceed the speed . limit, but only in emergencies. Joe . Burns, from the charity Brake, said: ‘Driving at very high speeds on . public roads poses a horrendous  danger, so anyone caught driving in . this reckless way should face appropriately stiff penalties.’ Yesterday . Supt Darren Ellis, head of professional standards at Durham Police, . said the officer had been removed from road policing. He added: ‘After a . thorough internal investigation the force has taken appropriate action. ‘The . officer was an advanced and highly skilled police driver and there was . no suggestion the vehicle was driven dangerously at any time. The . officer’s conduct prior to the incident had been exemplary.’ He will not return to full operational duties until it is deemed appropriate.

"By . Ian Drury . Fear of failure, bullying, the burden of trying to be thin and attractive, and depression were among the multiple threats facing young people, the study found (library image) Children in Britain are suffering from growing up in a 'toxic climate' of stress and pressure at school and online, a damning new study has found. Fear of failure, bullying, the burden of trying to be thin and attractive, and depression were among the multiple threats facing young people. And almost a quarter of youngsters questioned said their relationships with their peers had been harmed after viewing online porn, according to the poll. The alarming results, published today, raise the bleak prospect of the country's young people sitting on a 'mental health timebomb', said campaigners. The survey, commissioned by national charity YoungMinds, adds to a growing body of evidence that UK youngsters are among the unhappiest in the world. The study, which questioned 2,000 children and young people aged 11 to 25, found: . • More than half of school pupils believe they will be a failure if they don't achieve good exam grades . • A staggering 50 per cent of 11-14 year olds have viewed online porn - with four out of ten of these admitting it affected their relationships with their friends . • Half of youngsters have been bullied . • 40 per cent 11-14 year olds skip meals to stay thin . • And one-third don't know where to turn to get help when they feel depressed or anxious. Lucie Russell, YoungMinds campaigns director, said: 'Every day we hear about the unprecedented toxic climate children and young people face in a 24/7 online culture where they can never switch off. 'Young people tell us they experience a continuous onslaught of stress at school, bullying, sexual pressures and bleak employment prospects. 'When this becomes too much for them they don’t know where to turn for help and when they do often the support just isn’t there for them. We are sitting on a mental health timebomb.' The charity has now launched a new campaign - YoungMinds Vs - which will fight for improvements in the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people. It will focus on the key concerns identified in the survey: bullying, sexual pressures, school stress, unemployment and lack of access to help. Frankie Sandford, of the pop group The Saturdays and who is backing the campaign, said: 'I get to talk to a lot of young people and I know there are so many who are really suffering and struggling with life. 'This is raising awareness of the importance of young people having good mental health, and everything that can be done to make that happen, including getting access to help when they need it.' A quarter of young people said online porn damaged their relationships with peers (library image) The campaign launch, at the House of Lords, comes at a time of growing concern that young people are being placed under massive strain at school and online. They are bombarded with sexualised images and the scourge of online porn. A survey in October last year found 60 per cent had been asked to take an explicit self-portrait - a 'sext' - on their mobile phones. In 2012 a group called the Save Childhood Movement, established by leading academics, found increasing numbers of children were failing to develop properly at a young age because of the pressures of modern life. The powerful lobby of childcare experts said that many under-16s spent too much time sat unsupervised in front of televisions, games consoles and the internet. Children were also among the most tested in the Western world and more likely to be exposed to junk food and poor diets.","Bullying, being attractive and depression add to young people's stress .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Crackdown: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith says the new system will stop people 'cheating the system' Thousands of unemployed benefit claimants will be forced to turn up at job centres for 35 hours a week to prove they are looking for work. Iain Duncan Smith wants to make sure people claiming jobless benefits are not ‘cheating the system; by secretly working cash-in-hand. The Work and Pensions Secretary warned that people who fail to turn up to special classrooms in job centres without good reason will lose their benefits. The latest crackdown comes after Chancellor George Osborne unveiled plans to force people claiming benefits to work for their welfare. Mr Duncan Smith used his speech at the Tory conference in Manchester to announce two trials forcing people on Jobseekers’ Allowance to spend the working day at jobcenres. They will have to attend a local centre for 35 hours a week for up to six months, where they will be given expert support and supervision to find work. Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘We will do everything we can for those who have come through the Work Programme and still don’t have a job. ‘But for those who aren’t doing all they could, or who we think are cheating the system, it is time to make very clear that enough is enough.’ He announced two new pilots for ‘full-time mandatory attendance centres’. One . will be targeted at the long-term unemployed at another focuses on . people who have just started claiming benefits and could be helped by . the intensive regime. ‘Claimants will attend a local centre . full-time for up to 6 months, with support and supervision to look for . work and apply for jobs,’ Mr Duncan Smith will add. ‘No attendance. No benefit. That is only fair.’ Change: Mr Duncan Smith said he wanted to end the 'something for nothing culture' Ministers expect the pilots to be running by the end of 2014 of next year, working with more than 6,000 people. They . think the scheme could have significant impact on moving claimants into . employment and reinforces the message that inactivity on benefits is . not an option. Under the Work Programme, private sector organisations and charities have been tasked with helping the unemployed find a job. Mr . Osborne announced the Help to Work scheme, which will force the . unemployed to do community volunteering from next year if they want to . claim their benefits. Those . who break the rules of the Help to Work scheme, for example by failing . to turn up for duty without a good reason, could lose their benefit for . four weeks. A second offence would see them lose it for three months. New policy: Thousands of unemployed people will be made to turn up to jobcentres 35 hours a week . Today at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, Mr Duncan Smith announced his further measure to get the long-term unemployed back to work. Speaking in the main hall, he said: 'I want to tell you about those who already showing early signs of not being able to commit to their obligations to work. 'Prior to the Work Programme, we are going to pilot a mandatory attendance centre where selected individuals will receive expert support and supervision while they search and apply for jobs - that is from 9am to 5pm, 35 hours a week for up to six months, simulating the working day. 'These pilots will be targeted at claimants who will benefit from the intensive support, one pilot before the Work Programme and one after the Work Programme. 'Alongside what we have already done with mandatory work programme and our tougher sanctions regime, this marks the end of the something for nothing culture.'","Iain Duncan Smith vows to cut benefits for those who fail to turn up .

'After the last league game (against NEC on May 3) I'll think about it. I'll talk to them and listen to what they have to say.' VIDEO Scroll down to see Tim Sherwood complain about other managers discussing his job . Approach: Ajax boss Frank de Boer will wait to the end of the season to talk to Tottenham Hotspur . On top: De Boer, 43, secured his fourth Eredivisie title in a row with a draw at Heracles on Sunday . Assistant: Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp (pictured right with Jaap Stam, left) is assistant to De Boer . Ajax held off a late charge from Feyernoord, who have won seven games in a row, to take the Dutch title at Heracles Almelo on Sunday. The 43-year-old, whose assistant at Ajax is Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp, is in his first managerial role since retiring as a player and the latest title made it four in a row for the former Barcelona and Rangers defender. De Boer has also been mentioned as a possibility to take over at Monaco. He said he had been informed of the approach by the club's director of football Marc Overmars. ‘I would like to add something to a club like Brendan Rodgers did at Liverpool. ‘I see a perspective at Tottenham Hotspur, just as Liverpool and Newcastle United sometimes are, they are sleeping giants.’ Hot seat: Spurs boss Tim Sherwood's current deal has him in charge until the end of the 2014-15 season .

Ajax confirmed to the BBC that an approach by Tottenham had been made to Overmars more than three weeks ago. Current boss Tim Sherwood, who has the best win percentage of any Spurs manager in the Premier League era, was handed an 18-month contract in December but he was told a few weeks ago that he will be replaced in the summer.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A public defender who left her husband to marry a serial killer on death row has appeared by his side as he goes on trial for a 1986 killing. Rosalie Martinez met killer Oscar Ray Bolin Jr., 50, after working with him on one of his rape and murder cases in 1995 and married him soon after. He is now on trial in Florida for the fourth time in the murder of Natalie Blanche Holley, a 25-year-old who was stabbed eight times in 1986. Scroll down for video . Support: Rosalie Bolin, who divorced her prominent-lawyer husband to marry serial killer Oscar Ray Bolin, appears at his latest trial in Tampa, Florida . On trial: It is Bolin's 10th trial in the murders of three women in 1986 . It is the 10th time he has been on trial for attacking and killing three women in Tampa: Holley, Stephanie Collins and Terri Matthews. The former truck driver has been convicted nine times, but he's been retried three times in the Matthews and Collins cases. Each ruling was overturned after mistakes were discovered in the trials, but he is now serving two death sentences for Collins and Matthews. Despite this stream of court appearances and the grisly nature of his crimes, only 13 jurors out of a pool of 70 had prior knowledge of the killer, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Shock: Public defender Rosalie Martinez, left, met Bolin in 1995 when he was already on death row in Florida and was left 'breathless' by him . High profile: Rosalie continues to work as a death penalty opponent and mitigation specialist. Here she is seen working for the Casey Anthony defense team . His trial will be held this week and should finish by Friday. Holley's mother told the Tampa Bay Times she is not surprised few remember his horrific crimes. 'It was a long time ago,' Holley, who is unable to attend the trial due to ailing health, said. 'And this is Florida.' Bolin's first conviction for Holley's . murder was in 1991 and he was given the death penalty. Close: The couple were married over the phone, Rosalie has claimed . Convenience: She said the marriage was to raise awareness of the . injustice of his plight - and said she might not do the same if she had . another chance . It was overturned but he was convicted again in 1999 and given the death penalty. Again, this was overturned. In 2005, a jury found him guilty of second-degree . murder and was given a life sentence. Yet the judge's jury instructions were criticised, putting Bolin back in court probably until the end of the week. At . every appearance his wife, who works as a death penalty opponent and . respected mitigation specialist and worked on the Casey Anthony defense . team, has stood by his side, desperate to prove his innocence. Victim: It is the fourth time he has been on trial for the death of Natalie Blanche Holley, who was fatally stabbed eight times in 1986 . Killed: Bolin is on death row on two separate . death sentences for the murders of Stephanie Collins, left, and Terri Matthews, right . Rosalie, who now claims she married . Bolin to bring attention to the injustice of his death penalty, said: . 'It's not his fault he's here a fourth time.' Kim Seace, a defense attorney in Tampa, told Fox News that the vast number trials for the three murders is unusual. She . added: 'You have to remember when it's a death penalty case, it's held . to a very high level of scrutiny at the appellate level. 'So they are going to scrutinise absolutely everything that took place.' In 1995, public defender Rosalie Martinez was married to a prominent lawyer, with whom she had four young daughters. Then she met Oscar Ray Bolin, Jr. The convicted serial killer was already on death row in Florida when she visited him in his cell to talk about his case. 'I felt his isolation, his confinement, his loneliness. It affected me because I felt the same way. And it left me breathless,' she told the L.A. Times. She accepted that he had pleaded guilty to a gunpoint rape, but was adamant he was no killer, and was desperate to prove his innocence. Martinez became estranged from her family and quit the public defender's office after jail officials said she had sex with Bolin in his cell. In 1996, the pair married over the phone, whiles she was in a Gainesville, Florida apartment and he was in jail, she told the L.A. Times. She stood by his side and helped defend him through the trials . for the murders of Natalie Holley, Terri Matthews and Stephanie Collins. Despite a public showing of affection at his early re-trials, she has since expressed doubts that she should have married him. She told the Tampa Bay Times that the marriage was not out of attraction, but was a 'great personal sacrifice' to bring attention to what she believed was a terrible injustice. Asked if she would do it again, she said: 'Let's just say I'd tweak it.' But she maintains his innocence: 'It's not Oscar's fault he's here a fourth time,' she said at the jury selection on Monday.

"By . Chris Greenwood . Lord Justice Leveson ignored direct police evidence of how blue-chip companies fuelled the illegal trade in personal information. A senior officer submitted documents outlining how a little-known three-year inquiry uncovered a nationwide network of corruption. The multi-million-pound investigation found law firms, debt collectors and insurers were behind the thriving underground trade. But despite holding eight months of gruelling public hearings at a huge cost to the taxpayer, Leveson dismissed the officer’s evidence in less than 18 minutes. To the point: Lord Justice Leveson dismissed police evidence in just 18 minutes . The revelation renews pressure on the High Court judge to explain why he ignored evidence of hacking and other illegal activities outside of the media. He is already under fire for refusing to consider an incendiary intelligence dossier compiled by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca). It included a list of 102 companies and individuals linked to a group of rogue private eyes who blagged, hacked and stole sensitive data. Earlier this week Soca chairman Sir Ian Andrews resigned after failing to declare a conflict of interests as the row over the list rumbled on. The move raised hopes that members of the home affairs committee will find a solution to the deadlock created by his refusal to allow its publication.Last night, Labour shadow home secretary Stella Creasy said there was a growing sense of confusion and Soca’s ‘silence’ cannot continue. She said the crime-fighting agency had lost people’s confidence and there were ‘legitimate questions’ over whether disclosing the names would be in the public interest. She added: ‘We urgently need Soca to give clear answers to legitimate questions about its confidential list.’ Evidence about the three-year inquiry was given by Russell Middleton, who was then an acting assistant chief constable for Devon and Cornwall Police. Listen up: Evidence was given by Russell Middleton who was an acting chief constable for Devon and Cornwall Police . In papers submitted to the Leveson Inquiry, he revealed how he and others uncovered evidence of a network of corrupt public officials. Police officers, support staff, prison guards and benefits agency staff were all suspected of leaking confidential information to private detectives. They in turn were supplying corporate clients who were hungry for sensitive data that could not be obtained elsewhere. The inquiry, known as Operation Reproof, began after a member of public uncovered a building contractor’s criminal record during a planning dispute. Police suspected the information was obtained illegally and quickly discovered an illicit network handling private data. They found that the personal details of Gordon Brown, at that time Chancellor, were checked on the Police National Computer. Devon and Cornwall alerted five other forces, including the Met, as organisations including the prison service, benefits agency, BT and mobile phone companies were targeted. The inquiry led to six men – two serving police officers, two retired officers, and two private detectives – being charged. But the sprawling case was thrown out of court in 2005 by a judge who said it had no hope of securing any convictions. In a remarkable comment, the Exeter judge said he did not consider a PC passing private information to a former  colleague as ‘a serious matter that amounted to misconduct’. Mr Middleton said that his inquiry nevertheless uncovered shocking evidence of how the illegal information trade went far wider than the media. He told Leveson he ‘never found any direct evidence or indirect evidence linking that information being requested by or for any part of the media or journalists’. Instead the clients were ‘national companies, insurance companies’ who were instructing investigations into civil claims, accidents and marriage disputes. The senior officer’s evidence adds weight to criticism of Leveson for focusing too narrowly on the media. Tory MP Nicola Blackwood, a member of the home affairs committee, has previously suggested that Leveson could have adopted a broader remit. Speaking last month about  evidence contained in the suppressed Soca report, Miss Blackwood said it could have changed the course of the inquiry. She said: ‘I cannot understand why they did not make these points to the Home Office when the Leveson Inquiry terms of reference were being set in the first place.’ A Leveson Inquiry spokesman said: ‘The terms of reference for the inquiry related to the culture, practices and ethics of the press and how they engaged with the public, the police and politicians. Evidence on other issues was outside those terms of reference.’","Investigation found law firms were involved in the underground trade .
But despite coming at a great cost to the taxpayer, Leveson dismissed it .

Allison Griffor was sleeping in her bed at her family’s home in Charleston, South Carolina, early on Tuesday when a bullet from a shotgun fired through the front door hit her and lodged in her brain. Her father William had gone to the front door when he heard it being kicked, but before he could open it shots were fired through and he was also hit. His daughter was sleeping in the front room. Aged five: Allison Griffor was shot in the head during a suspected home invasion and has died three days later . Allison, a pupil at Drayton Hall Elementary School, had her life support machine turned off on Thursday after doctors could not find any activity in her brain scans. Her organs have been donated. It all began when Mr Griffor heard a loud banging on the front door and went to investigate, but as he reached for the lock there was a blast, reported WCBD. He told all the children to get under the bed. ‘I went to the room to tell the kids and wife “we’re safe” and turned on the light to find our daughter would not respond,’ he told WCBD. ‘My wife turned her and she was laying in a pool of blood. ‘The bullets had went through the door, through the wall, shooting her in the head as she lay sleeping in her safe bed… I was injured in the incident, but our daughter was critically injured.’ Tragedy: Allison Griffor, pictured left with her mother and right with her father, was sleeping in her bed at home early on Tuesday when a bullet from a shotgun fired through the front door hit her and lodged in her brain .

Thuderstorm captured by 18 year old photographer visiting family from Alaska who had never witnessed large a electrical storm . By . Matt West . A huge thunderstorm saw lightning hit the newly completed One World Trade Centre making for dramatic scenes in New York on Sunday evening as storms battered the city and raged across the east coast of America. The thunderstorm provided New Yorkers some much-needed relief from a weekend of sweltering temperatures while also providing one keen photographer the opportunity to capture these dramatic images. Storms flattened trees and utility poles in parts of northern New England, delayed flights in New York City and caused a tornado to touch down in South Carolina. Super storm: New York and the east coast of the US were battered by strong winds and rain. The storm caused power cuts leaving many still without electricity on Monday. The weather service issued a rare tornado warning as a line of thunderstorms raced through New Hampshire into western Maine. By early Monday, more than 12,000 customers were still without power in . Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, down from more than 40,000 outages at . the peak. In northwestern South Carolina, a . tornado reportedly knocked a home off its foundation and blew part of . the roof off, said Taylor Jones, director of emergency management for . Anderson County. Some trees were blown down and there was heavy rain, . but no widespread damage. No injuries were reported. The stormy weather in the New York . City region shortened the Boston Red Sox-New York Yankees game to 5 1/2 . innings and produced backups at major airports. But by early Monday, . delays were down to 15 minutes or less at airports on the East Coast. The Big Apple has been sweltering in record temperatures for several days before the thunderstorm. Lightning strike: lightning strikes the newly completed world trade centre during a dramatic thunderstorm in New York over the weekend. Temperatures hit 90 degrees . Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) for the third day in a row in parts of . New York and New Jersey on Saturday, making it the first official heat . wave of the year. Temperatures peaked at 32 degrees . Celsius in Central Park and 33 degrees in Newark, New Jersey on Saturday . afternoon after hitting similar sweltering numbers Thursday and Friday. Keen photographer . Nick Carwile, 18, was in the city visiting family and was fortunate to . have his camera with him when the storm broke. But it wasn't until he looked closer . that he noticed the bright blue bolt that had spectacularly struck the . top of the iconic 1,776ft tall landmark. Nick captured these dramatic image . from his aunt and uncle's apartment in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. He . had never witnessed serious storms where he lives in Alaska. Lightning strikes over One World Trade Center, center right, during a thunderstorm seen from The Heights neighborhood of Jersey City, N.J., Sunday, June 2, 2013 . He said: 'At first I didn't really know what was going on - I started taking pictures just hoping something would happen. 'When the bolts of lightning struck, there was a huge flash of light and . less than two seconds later the loudest thunder I have ever heard . rattled my room - I almost picked up my camera in fear of it falling off . the window ledge. 'After the exposure was complete I couldn't believe what I saw - I felt amazingly lucky to finally capture a strike. 'I didn't know where the lightning had stuck until I looked at the picture again 20 minutes later. 'I actually didn't notice it had struck One World Trade but it was an incredible feeling to know I'd got that exact moment.' The U.S has been battered by extreme weather in the last month including a two . mile wide tornado which tore through the suburbs of Oklahoma City leaving a trail of devastation reminiscent of a war zone as it leveled entire streets and . buildings killing 13 people . The tornado cut a 20 . mile long swath of destruction - flattening an elementary school and medical centre in the town of Moore as the tornado winds reached . upwards of 200 mph. New York itself has see an increase in storms in recent years including the Superstorm Sandy last autumn which caused major flooding throughout the city. The final part of One Wold Trade Centre was only recently completed with the final component of the antenna installed on top the skyscraper on 10 May this making it the third tallest building in the world.","Lightning strike on One World Trade Centre as storms batter east coast .

"By . Dan Bloom . A British mother who said she accidentally ran over her husband on a Caribbean island has been jailed for 12 years for his killing. Holiday rep Nicole Reyes, 38, was driving home from a night out in the Dominican Republic next to coconut water salesman Jorge when her car hit his motorbike, leaving him dead. She insisted he had swerved to avoid an oncoming car and hit her by accident - but police in the Caribbean accused her of murder. Accused: Nicole Reyes (pictured left and right with her husband) has been jailed for 12 years for killing her husband Jorge in a road crash in the Dominican Republic in July 2012, despite insisting it was an accident . Today Mrs Reyes was jailed for 12 years after being held with 15 other women in a 12ft by 12ft cell for 18 months. Her family said she was convicted of voluntary homicide, believed to be the Dominican Republic's equivalent of murder. She had initially faced a jail term of up to 30 years. Mrs Reyes' mother Jeanette Clements and stepfather Mike were in court in the city of Puerto Plata for the two and a half hour hearing and have vowed to appeal the verdict. They are meeting with British diplomats to fight for her release. Mrs Clements, 61, said: 'I have told Nicole to keep her chin up. I really did . believe she would be coming home with me this week. We are going to . appeal. Distraught: Mrs Reyes' mother Jeanette Clements, pictured, insists her daughter is innocent . 'She has problems with her kidneys. She is ill and needs medical help. I don’t think she’s going to cope in that prison. 'She was in a tiny room which was only about 12ft by 12ft and there were 15 women in there. 'She was literally sleeping on the floor, there was a bucket in the corner and they were not allowed out at all. 'She is innocent but she has no chance of a fair trial out there. All we can do is stay strong for her.' Mrs Reyes first visited the island on holiday before taking a holiday rep job with Thomas Cook, where she met her husband, a coconut water salesman, in 2006. Mrs Clements said: 'She is innocent but she has no chance of a fair trial out there. All we can do is stay strong' They married in 2007 and had what was described as a happy relationship until the crash in July 2012. Mrs Reyes was driving her sports utility vehicle next to the Yamaha 125 motorbike being ridden by her 38-year-old husband when the crash happened. Police told Mrs Reyes they would take her to hospital - but took her straight to prison, it is claimed. Mrs Reyes’ children Luke and Leah, both 18, have moved back to the UK to be with their grandparents and speak to their mother every day on the phone. Leah said: 'We are heartbroken that mum is not going to be coming home but we will continue to fight in court and will appeal the decision. 'Twelve years is better than 30 years but for her to be in prison at all is pathetic because she has done nothing wrong.' A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office told MailOnline: 'We're aware that a British national, Nicole Reyes, has been detained in the Dominican Republic since July 2012.

"By . Tim Shipman . Unemployed people who make a 'lifestyle choice' to live on benefits without bothering to seek work will face a crackdown from next year, Iain Duncan Smith has announced. The Work and Pensions Secretary has warned that anyone who refuses to seek work will have 'no hiding place' under his reforms. Today, in an article written for the Daily Mail, he goes on to insist that looking for work should be a 'full-time job' in itself. Iain Duncan Smith says anyone who refuses to seek work will have 'no hiding place' And he reveals that from 2014, thousands of jobless people who are 'lacking motivation' will be forced to spend 35 hours a week applying for work. He says: 'This will make it crystal clear that looking for work requires as much effort and commitment as a full-time job – and that jobseekers should think of themselves as in work to find work.' The minister adds that the decision to claim unemployment benefits should no longer be 'a lifestyle choice'. Mr Duncan Smith also makes clear that the Government remains unbowed by recent controversy over the introduction of Universal Credit as well as the cuts to housing benefit for claimants with spare rooms – the so-called 'bedroom tax'. And he writes: 'I'm not going to say “job done”. We've made great strides in fixing the system, but there is more to do. That includes asking for more from jobseekers.' Mr Duncan Smith recognises that most jobseekers 'are determined to get a job' and pledges to help those who are genuinely searching for work. Unemployed people who make a 'lifestyle choice' to live on benefits without bothering to seek work will face a crackdown from next year . But he says that there should be 'no hiding place' for people who 'won't play by the rules'. At October's Tory Party conference, Mr Duncan Smith announced that there were plans to make some jobless attend 'full-time mandatory attendance centres'. He said the plans for enforced full-time job searches would be aimed at the long-term unemployed and those suspected of working in the black economy, who earn cash in hand rather than searching for legitimate jobs. Today, he has made it clear that the new system will also be targeted at unemployed people who lack 'the motivation' to find work. DWP sources say that those who can't be bothered to look for work will be identified early by job centre staff. They will have to enrol in a full-time job search before they are referred to the Work Programme – the Government scheme to provide support, work experience and training to the unemployed. Addressing his critics, Mr Duncan Smith insists in his article that it is 'a complete nonsense' to suggest that the Government has removed the welfare safety net. And he vows to continue rolling out Universal Credit, which will replace most out-of-work benefits with a single payment, despite having to delay the full introduction of the plans until 2017. Making a virtue of the delay, Mr  Duncan Smith says the scheme will be rolled out across the country 'carefully and safely over the next four years'. He goes on to say that he believes the slower time frame should help avoid the 'costly mistakes' that Labour made introducing schemes 'in a “big bang” approach'. Mr  Duncan Smith last week revealed that the welfare cap of £26,000 per household has pushed 250 people into work every week. Government figures show that almost half of those affected by the benefit limit are now back in work. And since April, adults in 19,000 households who have had their benefits capped have taken up jobs. Some 1,300 of these households now claim £200 less a week than they did before the cap. And another 51 households  are claiming £400 less under the new rules. Previously these claimants could have been receiving £46,000 from the Government each year. By IaIN DUNCAN SMITH . Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith writing in today's Daily Mail . The last Labour Government left us with a hopelessly broken welfare system – one that trapped people on  benefits, and paid some people more in benefits than other hardworking people received for doing an honest day's work. On Labour's watch, welfare spending spiralled out of  control, increasing by over 60 per cent – at a cost of £3,000 for every British household. That is why this year we have introduced a cap on the amount of benefits that  people who are out of work can receive – and ended the madness whereby millions of people have been stuck on benefits because taking a job would actually make them worse off. We are making sure you're always better off in work than on benefits. These policies give claimants a real incentive to find work, and around 19,000 who would potentially have been subject to the benefit cap have already moved into work. We have also limited the annual increase for most working age benefits to 1 per cent – saving another £500million this year alone. In April we launched Universal Credit which will merge six benefits into one and make it easier for claimants to move off benefits and into work. It's up and running in seven areas of the country, and will roll out across the country carefully and safely over the next four years, avoiding the costly mistakes Labour made introducing schemes in a 'big bang' approach. However, while the economy's turning a corner and we've seen a record 30million people in work, I'm not going to say 'job done'. We've made great strides in fixing the system, but there's more to do. That includes asking for more from jobseekers. I know most jobseekers are determined to get a job, and we give them all the support they need to realise this aspiration. But there must be no hiding place for those who won't play by the rules. By spring, every Jobcentre in the country will be signing new jobseekers up to the Claimant Commitment, which sets out clear actions to complete each week in return for their benefit. And next year, I will trial a new scheme that will require 6,000 jobseekers to spend 35 hours a week at a supervised jobsearch centre. People who have been out of work for several years or those who are lacking motivation will be required to spend up to six months looking for and applying for jobs in return for their benefits. This will make it crystal clear that looking for work requires as much effort and commitment as a full-time job – and that jobseekers should think of themselves as in work to find work. Claiming unemployment  benefits is no longer a lifestyle choice. Fair to claimants and fair to the taxpayer – those are the changes we're making. We can't fix the welfare  system overnight, but we're getting there.","Work and Pensions Secretary issues warning to unemployed people .

"By . David Thomas . Nick Freeman is the millionaire lawyer known as Mr Loophole thanks to his astonishing ability to get celebrities off driving offences with the most extraordinary explanations or technicalities. But last week he suffered a rare defeat when representing Girls Aloud star Sarah Harding, who was accused of using a mobile phone while driving and failing to stop for police. Freeman told Highbury Magistrates Court that depriving Harding of her licence would be unfair since she was too famous to take the bus. But District Judge Nina Tempia was having none of it, saying: ‘Pay someone to drive you.’ Nick Freeman (left) is the lawyer known as Mr Loophole thanks to his ability to get celebrities off driving offences with the most extraordinary explanations or technicalities. The lawyer suffered a rare defeat when representing Girls Aloud star Sarah Harding (right) Other judges, however, have been convinced by the merits of Freeman’s pleas on behalf of his clients, however outlandish. Here, David Thomas presents some of his most high-profile clients and cases, but can you spot which was the real argument Freeman used, and which are our inventions? Jimmy Carr . THE CASE: In 2009, the comedian — who has been represented by Freeman in three separate driving charges — was alleged to have used a mobile phone while driving his Bentley through Harrow, North-West London. Carr was cleared. So what had Freeman argued? (a) Carr’s accountant had just rung, warning him that if he didn’t find a way of shifting his tour receipts out of the country he might actually have to pay some tax. He felt obliged to take the call. (b) Carr was only pretending to make a telephone call to stop fans coming up to him at red lights and trying to talk to him. (c) Carr was not making a telephone call. He was actually using his iPhone to dictate an idea for a joke and dictating into a phone is not illegal. Comedian Jimmy Carr (right) and lawyer Nick Freeman leave Sudbury Magistrates Court, Suffolk, in March 2009 . Colin Montgomerie . THE CASE: Another three-time client of Freeman’s, the heavyweight golfer escaped a possible 56-day ban in June 2010, having been fined £60 for driving his £115,000 Bentley Continental Flying Spur at 70mph in a 40mph zone of the A3 in South-West London, then failing to pay the penalty on time. How did Freeman persuade the court to let Monty keep driving? (a) Monty has a medical condition that requires him to eat twice as often as other people and so has to travel by car because the buffet trolleys are apt to run out on trains. (b) Monty is scared of flying and is thus obliged to drive from his home in Scotland to Surrey just to see his and ex-wife Eimear’s three children. (c) Monty cannot fly because he’s always harassed in the departure lounge by sports fans asking him why he’s never won a single  golf Major. Golfer Colin Montgomerie (right) arrives with solicitor Mr Freeman (left) at the Feltham Magistrates Court accused of speeding . Ronnie O’Sullivan . THE CASE: In 2007, Freeman successfully defended snooker star O’Sullivan, who was accused of failing to provide police with a urine sample when suspected of drink driving. In a bizarre, twice-heard case, which of these arguments did Freeman NOT employ: . (a) The trial should be stopped because the magistrate was winking at a journalist, to which the magistrate replied: ‘Do you think I’m gay or something?’ (b) Police had not followed proper procedure because one of the arresting officers asked O’Sullivan for an autograph. (c) O’Sullivan could not provide a sample because his well-known depressive disorder meant that he was too stressed to pee. David Beckham was given an eight-month ban in 1999 but Freeman successfully appealed the verdict . David Beckham . THE CASE: In 1999, Becks was given an eight-month ban, having been caught driving his £150,000 Ferrari at 76mph in a 50mph zone in Wilmslow, Cheshire. Freeman successfully appealed the verdict. The reason: . (a) Becks was suffering severe emotional trauma, having recently been hit by a football boot kicked by Sir Alex Ferguson and thus had no idea of his speed. (b) Becks was ‘petrified’ having been chased for ten miles from his Alderley Edge home by a paparazzo. (c) He was hurrying home because his wife Victoria had a Spice Girls concert in Manchester and he was on babysitting duties with his newborn son Brooklyn. Sir Alex Ferguson . THE CASE: In 1999, Beckham’s then-manager also had cause to be grateful for Freeman’s services, having been caught avoiding a motorway traffic jam by driving down the hard shoulder. Freeman successfully argued that Fergie had a good reason for doing so, to wit: . (a) He was desperately trying to catch up with the Man United team coach, which had accidentally left without him, en route to a vital Premier League fixture. (b) He had a stomach upset, feared he was about to be caught short and was frantically trying to get to the toilet at Manchester United’s training ground. (c) He’d been chased by a car sporting Manchester City flags and driven by fans making obscene gestures, and, as an elderly man driving on his own, feared for his personal safety. Jeremy Clarkson (pictured earlier this week) was represented by Mr Freeman in 2006 . Jeremy Clarkson . THE CASE: In October 2006, an Alfa Romeo that had been loaned to the Top Gear presenter was snapped doing 82mph in a 50mph zone in Ruislip, West London. Freeman had the case dropped within a matter of minutes. What was his winning argument? (a) Alfa Romeo, to whom the ticket was issued, passed it on to Clarkson because he had been loaned the car. But all Alfa knew was that Clarkson had borrowed the car — they had no proof he’d been driving it. (b) The driver could have been any one of the Top Gear team. And if it had been Richard Hammond he would have been too small to be spotted by a speed camera, anyway. (c)  It was a matter of deep personal principle. Clarkson had just overtaken a bus because he believes that: ‘Poor people just don’t need to get anywhere quicker than I do.’ Andrew Flintoff . THE CASE: The England cricketer was alleged to have been driving at 87mph in a temporary 50mph zone on the M62. Yet the case against him at Liverpool Magistrates Court collapsed in less than a minute. Did Freeman say that: . (a) As a Test cricketer, Flintoff had such pin-sharp eyesight and fast reflexes that there was no danger in driving at speeds that might be hazardous for average men and women with normal reaction times. (b) Flintoff regularly bowled at 87mph so he simply did not perceive that speed as being particularly fast, and was thus unaware that he was breaking the limit. (c) The authorities were simply too slow and the prosecution notice was received by Flintoff 16 days after the alleged offence, when the law says it has to be issued in 14 days. England cricketer Andrew Flintoff leaves Liverpool Magistrates' Court after he was acquitted of speeding . Joe Cole . THE CASE: In 2010, England footballer Joe Cole escaped an automatic six-month ban despite being caught driving at 105mph on the A3 in Surrey. Freeman had the punishment cut to a £750 fine and a 50-day ban, which was immediately suspended when Freeman said that he would appeal the verdict. So did he argue that: . (a) Cole had to be able to drive, since his wife Carly Zucker had been traumatised by a recent carjacking, could no longer drive herself and was, yes, too famous to use public transport. (b) Cole was unaware of the speed he was doing because Carly had gone into hysterics after breaking a heel on her £1,000 Louboutins and he was on a mercy dash to  the cobblers. (c) Injury-prone Cole had just been passed fit by a top Harley Street doctor and he was rushing to tell his manager the good news before he crocked himself again. Footballer Joe Cole's wife Carly Zucker . Ian Brown . THE CASE: In October 2011, the Stone Roses singer was clocked doing 105mph in his luxury Lexus on the M6. He was fined £650 and given six penalty points, but escaped a ban thanks to Freeman’s explanation that Brown needed his car because: . (a) It was the only way of getting to the top-secret location where the Stone Roses were rehearsing for a series of comeback concerts. (b) Brown’s unfair reputation for riotous, rock star behaviour meant that he was already banned from virtually all forms of public transport and air travel. (c) Brown hated taking public transport because fans of other bands constantly made fun of the fact that he has a more than passing resemblance to a monkey. AND ONE THAT GOT AWAY . . . Caprice Bourret . THE CASE: In August 2006, former supermodel Caprice was given a  12-month ban for drink-driving, despite Freeman’s attempt to convince the court that she had not really been consuming alcohol. Did he claim: . (a) Caprice had been intoxicated by painkillers used to ease the  agonising complications caused by recent surgery. (b) Caprice had been dazed by anti-depressants taken to ease the emotional pain caused by cruel, untrue rumours that her looks were the result of extensive plastic surgery. (c) Caprice had been taking drugs for a urinary tract infection that had given her ‘alcohol halitosis’, creating a false impression that she had been drinking.

"By . Martin Robinson . Panicking Tube workers fled in all directions to buy sugar so they could stop quick-drying cement setting after it was mistakenly poured into an underground station control room, it emerged today. Contractors were seen pouring bag after bag into the sludge when vital signalling equipment was submerged in a 'f*** up of major proportions', staff have said. Cement meant for new foundations of a £700million upgrade at Victoria had leaked into a control room, and a large amount of sugar, which is a 'cement destroyer', was needed to stop it becoming solid. Hundreds of thousands of commuters were left stranded when Victoria Line services from Brixton to Warren Street were suspended yesterday afternoon, but after working through the night it opened again this morning. Chaos: The Victoria Line was shut  after a signal control room was flooded with cement, so worker rushed to find sugar to stop it setting . Stranded: The leak onto signalling equipment  caused the Victoria Line to close at around 2pm between Warren Street and Brixton - it only reopened this morning . Error: The cement was meant for some foundations, but spread into a control room causing panic among staff . Aside from the obvious mistake, Transport for London was further criticised after they initially put the line closure down to flooding, but they said today there had been 'confusion' about what happened. An insider said the catastrophe left workers knee-deep in concrete desperately trying to stop expensive signalling equipment being destroyed. 'The only word for it is a f*** up of major proportions. Everyone was f-ing and blinding when they realised what had happened,' an insider told the Evening Standard. 'It was knee-deep in the signal room swamping all the relay equipment and it’s going to be very, very expensive to repair because it was all brand new.' Sugar is used by builders to keep cement liquid because it interferes with the binding process. Cement hardens when it hydrates, but sugar molecules delay the chemical reaction. 'When they realised what had happened they went out and bought bags of sugar and threw it on,' the same source said. 'TfL were telling people the reason for the closure was flooding, because technically it was. They just didn’t say it was flooded with concrete. They didn’t want people to know what a c***-up it was'. Anger: Passengers were initially told the closure was due to 'flooding' at Victoria Station, but TFL said this was down to 'confusion' When water is added to cement and mixed, it will set and harden. To slow or stop the process sugar is widely used and is known as a 'cement destroyer'. Small amounts of sugar - around 1 to 100 parts cement - will delay the onset of it becoming hard, but much larger proportions will stop the process completely. But it must be done quickly, otherwise there will be no stopping the process. The calamity on the Victoria Line left tens of thousand of rush hour commuters searching for an alternative way to get home last night, with police used to control crowds. A spokesman for Transport for London said this morning the problem has been resolved and was now operating a good service. Nigel Holness, London Underground's operations director, said contractors had been working on the new station in an area next to the Victoria line signal control room. 'These works involved the use of water and cement which leaked into the room, damaging equipment,' he said. Pictures were posted on the UsVsth3m website showed a thick layer of cement in the affected room. A spokesman for the RMT union said yesterday: 'We understand that a foot of concrete burst into the control room, having been poured into an escalator void. 'We await further information but what we do know is that LU technicians are on site now, working flat out to clear up the mess and get services back on line, proving once again that it's directly-employed public sector staff who are needed to deal with this kind of emergency, making a nonsense of Boris Johnson's Tube staff cuts plans.'","The leak at Victoria closed Victoria Line between Warren Street and Brixton .

"By . James Rush . Jailed: Ilyas Ashar, 84, was sentenced to 13 years in prison for repeatedly raping a deaf and mute girl he trafficked into the U.K. A pensioner who repeatedly raped a deaf and mute girl he trafficked into UK and kept in his celler for almost a decade has been jailed for 13 years today. Ilyas Ashar, 84, was told he subjected his victim to a life of 'misery and degradation' as he sexually abused the youngster from the moment he brought her into the UK from Pakistan in June 2000 when she was a 10-year-old girl. Ashar beat the victim, who is profoundly deaf and cannot speak, used her to satisfy his sexual desires and forced her to sleep and work in the cellar of his five bedroom family home in Eccles, Salford. She was also used to steal more than £30,000 in benefits. The girl never went to school in Pakistan or Britain, but was taught by the Ashars to sign her name to claim benefits. For . nearly 10 years she had to work for the Ashars who are understood to . have a number of business interests and rental properties. The . exact age of the victim is not known, but Minshull Street Crown Court . heard how she was sexually abused by Ilyas Ashar from pre-puberty. He would routinely rape the girl in the cellar and other houses the family owned - though she would try to fight him off. Ilyas Ashar (left) has been jailed for 13 years while his wife Tallat Ashar (right) has been imprisoned for five years after they were convicted at Minshull Street Crown Court today . Ashar was convicted of 13 specimen counts of rape by a jury last week, though the court heard the rapes happened 'many, many times more'. He had also been convicted at an earlier trial of two counts of trafficking a person into the UK for exploitation, two counts of furnishing false information to obtain a benefit and one of permitting furnishing of false information to obtain a benefit. Basement: The girl was kept in Ashar's cellar for almost a decade after she was brought to the UK as a 10-year-old in 2000 . His wife, Tallat Ashar, 68, was jailed for five years for two counts of trafficking a person into the UK for exploitation and four counts of furnishing false information to obtain a benefit. Their daughter, Faaiza Ashar, 46, was found guilty at an earlier trial of two counts of furnishing false information to obtain a benefit and one count of permitting furnishing of false information to obtain a benefit. She was given a 12 month community order with 300 hours of unpaid work. Passing sentence Judge Peter Lakin said: 'You Ilyas Ashar and you Tallat Ashar did not treat this girl as a human being. Into darkness: The stairs leading to the basement in Ashar's house in Salford, Greater Manchester . 'To you she was merely an object to be used, abused and cast aside at will. You took full advantage of her extreme vulnerability. 'You exploited her physically, you exploited her mentally and you exploited her economically. 'There was throughout a distasteful undercurrent of violence and intimidation. 'All that she had in her life was the love of her family and her own human dignity. You two took that away from her. You consigned her to a life of misery and degradation. 'Throughout these proceedings not one of you have shown any remorse. You are concerned with your own selfish, self-centred interests. 'You Ilyas and Tallat Ashar are deeply unpleasant, highly manipulative and dishonest people.' Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, told the court the victim could not be named because she is a victim of sexual offences. But he said an appropriate name would be 'Miss Courageous' - after spending 34 days in total being cross-examined by the Ashars’ lawyers during legal proceedings. 'She is a remarkable young woman. A young woman with great fortitude, courage and extraordinary resilience, not only in coming to terms with the treatment she received at the hands of Mr and Mrs Ashar, but also the way she stood up in court,' he said. 'She was the victim of threats and violence throughout her life from being a little girl. 'She was the subject of forced labour. Many of the elements of servitude are present. 'She was physically abused, sexually abused by Ilyas Ashar - that included being raped by him.' Family home: The Ashars kept the girl in the cellar of their five-bedroom home in Eccles, Salford . The girl was never given any schooling and could not read or write - except for being taught to sign her name by the Ashars so she could claim benefits. Mr Cadwallader said the victim would spend 'hours and hours' in the cellar and only one member of the Ashar family was ever kind to her. The girl wanted to return to her family in Pakistan almost from the moment she arrived in the UK - but the Ashars would not allow it. 'All that she had in her life was the . love of her family and her own human dignity. You two took that away . from her. You consigned her to a life of misery and degradation' - Judge Peter Lakin . The prosecutor added: 'She had no choice over her life; where she lived, what she did, where she slept. She knew nothing else.' The girl was often slapped or hit and would be dragged up the cellar stairs into the house if she did not come quickly enough when summoned. After coming to the UK, despite her apparent young age, as a domestic servant she was allowed to remain on an annual basis on condition that she did not make a claim on public funds. But by July 2005 she was given leave to remain indefinitely - and within two weeks the Ashars began claiming housing, council tax and income support for the girl. She was never paid for the work she did for the Ashar family but also never received a penny of the £36,045 in benefits they claimed for her. Minshull Street Crown Court heard how the victim was sexually abused by Ilyas Ashar (pictured) from pre-puberty . When police and local trading standards raided the Ashar family home on the morning of June 8, 2009, officers were 'shocked' to discover the girl asleep in the cold and dark cellar. They noted something was 'amiss' when she got up, went upstairs and, instead of sitting on a chair in the kitchen, sat on a plastic stool. One officer likened her behaviour to that of an 'animal' - not allowed to sit on the furniture - and an indication of her status in the house. She was taken from the house and is now doing well with the help of social services, the court heard. A proceeds of crime hearing will be held next year to recoup the benefits stolen by the Ashars. They had fought the case at every turn, mounting a series of legal challenges and appealing but failing to overturn their convictions at the Court of Appeal. Ian Rushton, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in the North West said: 'They brought her into this country to use her as forced labour, ill-treated her and with the help of their daughter exploited her financially by fraudulently claiming benefits. Worst of all she was repeatedly raped by Ilyas Ashar over a number of years. We have been determined to bring them to justice for this catalogue of abuse. 'Despite her terrible ordeal the victim is now making great progress in life generally, and she has shown immense courage and resilience. She is now free from the abuse that she suffered at the hands of Ilyas and Tallat Ashar and today they are facing up to the consequences of their actions as they begin substantial prison sentences.'","Ilyas Ashar sexually abused victim from moment he brought her into UK .

"By . Sarah Vine . One of the most difficult things about combining work and motherhood is finding the time to go to the gym. Shameful as this may sound, it’s always last on my to-do list. The problem is that a) I don’t really care enough about being super-thin and b) I would always rather spend what little spare time I have with my family than de-larding my buttocks on some sweaty treadmill. As a result, I’m always looking for other ways to cut corners, or should that be curves? Spanx, well-fitting bras, clever tailoring — these are the lazy tricks of the trade that help keep a not-so-slender 46-year-old like me looking in shape. Luckily, there’s been a High Street explosion of garments designed to fit and flatter the fuller figure. Women are spoilt for choice when it comes to elaborate underpinnings. And they look so much better now than they used to: no more granny knickers and hefty bras; modern shapewear, as its called, is glamorous, lacy and, dare I say, sexy. And the trend hasn’t stopped at underwear. The shops are full of actual clothes, from jeans to dresses, which are cleverly tailored and stashed with hidden panels discreetly to help out big girls like me — and at great prices. The dress Karren Brady wore to introduce Chancellor George Osborne’s speech at the Tory Party Conference this week was a perfect example of the genre: grey tweed with strategically placed lace panels to slim the waist. It was business-like yet feminine and at £38 from Bhs, a bargain worthy of a canny businesswoman.I decided to road test this new generation of figure-fixing dresses. Here’s how they fared...","Sarah Vine investigates the new explosion in 'shapewear' dresses .

"By . Mark Prigg . Fears of a 'premium internet' where providers are forced to pay more for faster access were growing today after a U.S. appeals court rejected federal rules that required Internet providers to treat all web traffic equally. The Federal Communications Commission's open Internet rules, also known as net neutrality rules, required Internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content without restrictions or varying charges. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down the regulation, which was passed in late 2010 and challenged in court by Verizon Communications Inc. A U.S. appeals court has rejected federal rules that required Internet providers to treat all web traffic equally . Current net neutrality rules require Internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content - be it web sites of streaming video. There are now fears Internet providers such as Verizon or Comcast would begin to charge content providers for faster access or slow down or even block access to particular sites. The largest providers on Tuesday pledged that they would not restrict how customers use the web, but consumer advocacy groups are concerned that in the future providers may begin charging content companies such as Netflix, Facebook or ESPN for faster Internet speeds. Two judges, with partial support from a third, said the FCC did have authority to regulate broadband access, but the agency failed to show that it had authority to impose the anti-discrimination rules on broadband providers. The ruling is a victory for Verizon and other broadband providers, who saw the FCC rules as government overreach into how they operate their networks. The largest providers on Tuesday pledged that they would not restrict how customers use the web, but consumer advocacy groups said they worried that providers may begin charging content companies such as Netflix, Facebook or ESPN for faster Internet speeds. The FCC had classified broadband providers as information service providers as opposed to telecommunications service providers, like telephone companies, and that distinction created a legal hurdle for the FCC's authority over them. This was the second time the court struck down the FCC's net neutrality rules. The FCC now could appeal the ruling to the full appeals court or to the U.S. Supreme Court, something FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said he is considering as he looked at ""all available options"" to ensure Internet networks remained free and open. The regulators could also try to reclassify broadband providers so they fall in the same category as traditional phone companies, a step that would give the FCC more oversight power. Public interest groups have urged the FCC to do so, but the move would face staunch opposition from Republicans and broadband providers. 'Unless Congress acts, we should stay our hand and refrain from any further attempt to micromanage how broadband providers run their networks' Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai said. Democratic leaders in Congress on Tuesday urged the FCC to take advantage of the oversight power the court did recognize over broadband and offered support in rewriting the rules. Republicans urged the FCC to stay hands-off. One of Google's data centers where internet traffic is routed . Wheeler recently has also suggested he could use existing FCC power to go after particular Internet service providers who violate the open Internet principles on a case-by-case basis. Former FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, who oversaw the adoption of the open Internet order in late 2010 and is now at investment firm Carlyle Group, declined comment on Tuesday. Supporters of the FCC rules worry that now Internet providers such as Verizon or Comcast Corp would begin to charge content providers for faster access or slow down or even block access to particular sites. 'That's just not the way the Internet has worked until now,' Matt Wood, policy director at public interest group Free Press, told Reuters. But opponents say the rules inhibit investments and are not necessary to ensure open access to Internet content. 'Today's decision will not change consumers' ability to access and use the Internet as they do now,' Randal Milch, Verizon's general counsel and executive vice president for public policy, said in a statement. U.S. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler testifies before the House Communications and Technology panel on Capitol Hill in Washington December 12, 2013 as part of the net neutrality hearings. 'Verizon has been and remains committed to the open Internet which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want.' 'This will not change in light of the court's decision,' Milch said. In the case against the FCC, Verizon had argued the open Internet order violated the company's right to free speech and stripped control of what its networks transmit and how. Prominent Internet providers Comcast and Time Warner Cable Inc also issued reassurances of their commitment to open Internet principles on Tuesday, as did the Broadband for America coalition representing various Internet service providers and CTIA, the wireless industry association. But content providers remained uneasy. 'Trust but verify,' said Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association that represents content providers including Netflix Inc, Google Inc, Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc. 'With the Internet and our member companies growing and changing and startups constantly popping up, protections do need to be placed for consumers.' Net neutrality supporters warned that the decision could indeed open the way for ISPs like Verizon to compromise Web access. 'The biggest broadband providers will race to turn the open and vibrant Web into something that looks like cable TV,' Craig Aaron, president of the advocacy group Free Press, said. 'They'll establish fast lanes for the few giant companies that can afford to pay exorbitant tolls and reserve the slow lanes for everyone else.'","Net neutrality rules currently require Internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Chloe Glasson, 15, developed the nightmare sleeping disorder narcolepsy after being vaccinated with swine flu drug Pandemrix in November 2009 . It was supposed to be a simple vaccine against swine flu, but since she had it, Chloe Glasson's life has been like a bad dream. Just four months after being given the Pandemrix injection, the 15-year-old schoolgirl developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy. Now, without warning, she falls asleep up to 30 times a day wherever she is. Naturally, this has made her life at school challenging, as she often drops off in class. But it is also potentially dangerous. Chloe recently went missing for two hours after going into a 'dream-like autopilot' state while making a short journey to her grandmother's house. She eventually found her own way home safely, but not before her terrified family had contacted police, amid fears of what might have happened to her. Now she is hoping a pioneering treatment will help her to establish a more normal sleeping pattern. She is to receive the specialist drug sodium oxybate – at a cost of  £13,000 a year – at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh. Chloe said: 'I am putting a lot of faith in the treatment. 'While the tablets won't cure me, they may offer the chance of a more normal life.' Vaccinated with Pandemrix in November 2009 during a flu pandemic, she is one of at least 100 people estimated to have developed narcolepsy afterwards. Studies have found a ten-fold increase in the risk of developing the disorder after the jab. Chloe's mother Rebecca, from Dysart, Fife, said: 'Her life has been devastated after we followed  government advice to have her immunised against the threat of swine flu. 'She has gone from being a bright, outgoing girl to one who cannot go out on her own. She doesn't doze for more than a couple of hours at a time, but she can have disturbing dreams. 'We desperately hope this new treatment will help.' The Government revealed in  September that it would pay damages to some of those who developed problems after being given the Pandemrix vaccine before August 31, 2010. Scroll down for video .

Bottles of Pandemrix, a vaccine against H1N1 influenza . Studies have found a 10-fold increase in the risk of developing the disorder after getting the Pandemrix jab . Chloe's family hope she will receive the maximum compensation of £120,000. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency dropped the vaccine from its flu campaign in 2011. Matt O'Neill, of the charity Narcolepsy UK, said: 'We believe that more than 100 people have developed narcolepsy because of the swine flu vaccine.' He added that families affected would meet to discuss the issue at the charity's conference in Birmingham this month. GlaxoSmithKline, which makes Pandemrix, said: 'Patient safety is our number one priority and we are researching how narcolepsy is triggered and how this vaccine might have interacted with other risk factors in affected individuals. We hope ongoing research efforts will enable us to provide more answers.' Narcolepsy is typically caused by the loss of neurons that produce a hormone that keeps people awake.","Chloe Glasson, 15, from Fife, falls asleep without warning .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A one-time glamor model has been arrested today in connection with a massive child porn bust. Julia Lack, 26, of Pearland, Texas, was arrested on Thursday and charged with one count of child pornography possession. Her boyfriend Tad Jeremy Costin, 41, was arrested on November 1 in a case involving potentially thousands of images of a man taking part in sexual acts with children. Julia Lack, 26, has been charged with child porn possession after her boyfriend Tad Jeremy Costin, 41, was arrested on similar charges last week . Costin (left) is accused of assaulting 15 young girls over more than 20 years and his girlfriend Julia Lack is also charged with child porn possession . Costin has been charged with four counts of aggravated sexual assault . of a child under age 14. He  allegedly assaulted at least 15 young girls aged under seven years old. Lack is listed as an 'inactive model' on Playboy's Miss Social competition - an online non-nude gallery where contestants submit and post their own photos. Playboy told MailOnline that Lack has no affiliation with or has ever been employed by Playboy. She never has held any titles associated with Playboy, including Playmate or Miss Social. She is being held at Pearland jail on $30,000 bail. Costin was arrested last week after . investigators found computer memory cards containing hundreds of images . of child pornography in boxes at his former home in Dayton. Costin moved to Pearland a few months ago and shares a home with his girlfriend and her five-year-old son. The sickening discovery of child porn was made by Lack's father Benny who found the images in a box left behind by his daughter at his home when she moved out. Investigators then allegedly found six hard drives and 80 CDs containing further abuse pictures at Costin's new address in Pearland. Lack, 26, is listed as an 'inactive model' on Playboy's Miss Social website. She is being held on bail over a child porn charge . Detectives say pictures included ones of him assaulting young children. Police believe there are 15 victims who have not been identified and say they are not related to Costin. They said some of the pictures could date back as far as 1990. Harris . County Assistant District Attorney Kathryn Kahle told KHOU that the . children appeared unresponsive in the pictures and may have been . drugged. She said: 'They are dressed in what appear to be nightgowns, little girl nightgowns. 'Some of them look as if they are unresponsive and/or drugged when they are engaged in those sexual acts.' Deputies said Costin has previously been arrested for similar offenses. He is currently being held in the Harris County jail without bond.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Margaret Thatcher’s government agonised over whether to demand British teams withdraw from the 1982 World Cup amid fears they might have to play Argentina - while British and Argentine troops were still fighting in the Falklands. England, Scotland and Northern Ireland all qualified for the 1982 World Cup finals held in Spain, with the opening game of the tournament scheduled for the middle of June. Among the papers released by the National Archives at Kew, west London, is a report by environment secretary Michael Heseltine, written in May 1982 as the taskforce steamed towards the Falklands, warning that British and Argentine players could soon be facing each other on the football pitch. Revelation: Margaret Thatcher's government agonised over whether to withdraw England, Scotland and Northern Ireland from the 1982 World Cup in case any of the teams met Argentina, who Britain was fighting in the Falklands War. Michael Heseltine, right, wrote that a match with Argentina would be a distasteful prospect . Her greatest triumph: Margaret Thatcher in Whitehall, beside a Falklands War painting . ‘In Britain, some footballers/administrators have already expressed concern at playing in a competition with Argentina. There is some feeling in our own party that this would be unacceptable,’ he wrote. Officials were also concerned at the heightened prospects of hooliganism at a time when it was still a big problem in the game. ‘Whatever happens between now and the end of the World Cup series, the Falklands Islands factor can only increase the risk of hooliganism, and there is nothing we can do to lessen the risk,’ warned WK Slatcher at the Foreign Office. Pitching in: The final England 22 who went to the World Cup in Spain in 1982 . Tartan army: Scotland also qualified for the 1982 World Cup . Diplomatic problems: The fact that Northern Ireland qualified for the 1982 World Cup, as well, further complicated matters for the Tory government . England got off to a great start, topping their group after three victories over France (3-1), Czechoslovakia (2-0) and Kuwait (1-0). But their campaign faltered in a tough second round against West Germany and Spain, flying home after drawing 0-0 against both of them. Northern Ireland also made a strong start, topping their group after beating Spain 1-0 and drawing 0-0 and 1-1 with Yugoslavia and Honduras respectively. Northern Ireland were eliminated in the second round after losing 1-4 to France and drawing 2-2 with Austria. Scotland were knocked out in the initial group stages. They got off to a flying start, beating New Zealand 5-2, but then lost 1-4 to Brazil and drew 2-2 with the Soviet Union. But while Mr Heseltine, as the Cabinet minister responsible for sport, acknowledged that a match involving one of the home countries against Argentina would be a distasteful prospect, he argued it would be wrong for the government to call for a boycott. Withdrawal by the UK teams would, he said, be greeted as a ‘moral victory’ by the Argentinians while damaging relations with Spain where there was strong support for the Argentine cause. And then there was the cost. ‘The financial consequences of a withdrawal are considerable for the three Football Associations,’ he wrote. ‘There could be a ban on competing in the 1986 World Cup; a heavy FIFA fine; the possibility of compensation; the cancellation of travel and accommodation arrangements; and players’ contracts would have to be met. ‘The Scottish and Northern Ireland Football Associations could be bankrupted. Whilst there might be no legal obligations on Her Majesty’s Government for compensation, there could be a moral one.’ The government should, he concluded, stay their hand while they waited to see how events turned out on the battlefield. Battle hardened: Royal Marines digging in at an East Falklands settlement during the Falklands War . Last-ditch effort: England's Kevin Keegan heads the ball during the dying minutes of England's Group B match against Spain during the 1982 World Cup . So close: Kevin Keegan is consoled by Paul Marriner after missing a chance to put England ahead against Spain in a match that ended 0-0 . ‘In the present international situation I believe that ministers can continue to argue strongly that Argentina is the aggressor nation and that the onus of withdrawal lies in that direction and not with us,’ he wrote. ‘My present view is that HMG should not yet suggest withdrawal to the football authorities, be that we should be ready to adopt that course, at short notice if the situation worsens and in the light of public opinion.’ In the event, the conflict ended and the Argentines surrendered just as the tournament was starting. In the football, the three UK sides and Argentina were all eliminated without having to play each other.","The 1982 World Cup took place as UK fought Argentina over the Falklands .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A violent thug who left a man confined to a wheelchair with a section of his skull missing after knocking him to the ground with a single punch has been handed a prison sentence of just 20 months. Thomas Field, 27, attacked Reece Roberts, who has a genetic growth disorder and learning difficulties, on a night out in Blackpool, Lancashire. A court heard how he approached Mr Roberts, 25, while he was smoking outside a bar, knocked him to the ground with a vicious blow and then said: 'he shouldn't have been so mouthy'. Life-changing injuries: After the attack Mr . Roberts, left, needed to have parts of his skull removed, and must now . be fed through a tube. He is pictured right before his injuries . 'Severely disabled': Mr Roberts, pictured with his mother Millissa, needs a wheelchair and now struggles to speak . Mr Roberts, 25, is now unable to walk or talk and must be fed through a tube. Surgeons had to remove part of his skull to relieve pressure on his brain. Field pleaded guilty to a charge of grievous bodily harm. The court heard how he lashed out at Mr Roberts 'for no apparent reason' as he stood outside Bar 19 in Blackpool smoking a cigarette. Unprovoked: Thomas Field, 27, attacked Reece Roberts, 25, for 'no apparent reason', leaving him severely disabled . The maximum sentence for his crime is five years, but Field was jailed for 20 months after the judge reduced his sentence for pleading guilty and being 'remorseful'. It means he could be released from prison after ten months. Mr Roberts, a student at Blackpool and The Fylde College, has a genetic disorder called cerebral gigantism, which means he is taller and thinner than most people, and also has learning difficulties. Millissa Roberts, 42, Mr Roberts's mother, has said she believes that he was targeted because of the condition, which is also known as Sotos syndrome. The hearing, at Preston Crown Court, heard how Mr Roberts was attacked at 1.50am on September 27 while he was 'minding his own business'. Prosecutor Miss Raquel Simpson told the court: 'The defendant was stood close by, then for no apparent reason . walked up to Reece and punched him once to the face. It caused him to . fall to the floor.' 'The defendant appeared to brag about what he had done - he said: ""He shouldn't have been so mouthy"".' Reece . was helped to his feet but then collapsed and was taken to Blackpool . Victoria Hospital, and was later transferred to Preston Royal Hospital due to his head injuries. Miss Simpson . said: 'He remains severely disabled and needs assistance to eat, walk . and other daily activities. It clearly has had a dramatic and . life-changing impact on the complainant. His recovery cannot be . predicted. It is likely he will be left with life a significant physical . disability.' 'Well-liked': Mr Roberts, pictured left holding his younger brother and right more recently, was popular at the college he attended, and was described by his mother as 'a joker' Police tracked down Field, a father of five, three days after the attack. When confronted with his crime he replied 'Yeah, I know'. A newspaper cutting about the attack was found at . the property. Field had . previous convictions for assault and battery including a suspended . sentence for causing actual body harm. In 2011 when he and two . accomplices attacked a man for no reason, kicking him in the head and causing . injuries to his eye. Defence lawyer Bob Sastry told the court: 'He is devastated by what he . has done and the injuries so severe as they are, through the delivery . of one punch. 'He is fortunate that he doesn't face the charge of manslaughter. He . extends a sincere apology to the family. He fully accepts that he has . issues with anger management.' Condition: Mr Roberts, pictured left aged three and right aged four, has the genetic condition cerebral gigantism . Growing up: Mr Roberts is pictured above as an eight-year-old. His injuries have changed his life 'forever' Passing . sentence, Recorder Michael Blakey told Field: 'Because of . your actions you have effectively destroyed a family and caused a great . deal of significant upset because of the catastrophic nature of the . injuries sustained. 'You . are extremely lucky you didn't cause the death of this young man. The . fact that you take drink and drink was taken is no excuse, what you did . on that particular night will never be an excuse. 'I accept that you are remorseful for what you did and pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.' Speaking after the verdict, Millissa Roberts said: 'I dream of him being on the street and I'm running towards him and then somebody comes and hits him and I'm still running and running. All I want to do is grab him and protect him. 'Reece was just minding his own business when he was attacked. He is so placid and well liked by everybody, he is funny and a joker. I think he was picked on because of the way he looks. 'My son has done nothing wrong in his life and has been through hell and back and still is going through it. Now doctors need to put metal plates in his head because his head is caving in and his brain is shrinking. 'It's heartbreaking to see the change in him going from a young lad who used to like going out with his mates and watching the football to being in hospital relying on other people to help him. He cannot speak, he needs to be fed directly into his stomach. 'The prognosis is unclear but it is clear his life has changed forever. I don't dare tell Reece what punishment Field got as he would be frightened to death of him coming after him again. He will be out in a few months yet we are serving a life sentence. To walk up to someone and punch them shows he is evil. 'What he got was simply not enough.'","Thomas Field, 27, attacked Reece Roberts on a night out in Blackpool .

"By . Louise Boyle . A Holocaust survivor returned an American flag to the family of a soldier who had given him the gift, the sole memento from his war-torn childhood that he kept for 67 years. Stephan Ross, now 81, was found by U.S. serviceman Steve Sattler, emaciated and terrified at Dachau concentration camp in Germany. After handing over his rations to the boy during the 1945 liberation, Sattler then gave him his handkerchief decorated with the Stars and Stripes. Scroll down for video . Never forgotten: Stephan Ross (pictured in striped jacket) hugs family of soldier Steven Sattler who liberated him from Dachau concentration camp, 67 years ago. Left, a picture of the late Mr Sattler . Poignant memento: Stephan Ross, dressed in a uniform like one he was forced to wear in the Nazi camps, kisses the handkerchief-flag that was given to him by an American soldier in 1945 . On Veteran's Day this Sunday, Mr Ross had the opportunity for the first time to thank the family of the man who rescued him. He hugged the children and grandchildren of Mr Sattler during the emotional meeting at the State House in Boston. Mr Ross wore a striped jacket and hat, like the camp uniform, along with his identification number. The 81-year-old gave Mr Sattler's family a boxed flag, saying: 'God Bless, America'. After the War, Steve Sattler had returned to live quietly on his farm in Unionville, Michigan, according to the Boston Globe. The father-of-six and Purple Heart recipient passed away in 1986 at the age of 70. Mr Ross, who now lives in Newton, . Massachusetts, had spent the War in concentration camps. Loving tribute: The children of soldier Steve Sattler (l-r) Gwen Allanson, Stephanie Sattler and James Sattler meet Stephan Ross to show him a picture of their late father after he gave them an American flag . Symbolic gesture: Mr Ross's son and Boston City Councillor Michael Ross holds up the flag his father received from an American soldier at Dachau concentration camp in Germany almost seven decades ago . Ever since being liberated by the Allies on April 29, 1945, Mr Ross had always . wondered what had happened to the soldier who had shown him kindness. The concentration camp at Dachau, near Munich in Germany, was founded in 1933 by Nazi commander Heinrich Himmler. The first prisoners were mainly political opponents of the Nazi regime along with Gypsies and homosexuals. The camp was expanded under horrific working conditions by prisoners - and operated until the fall of the fascist regime in 1945. Thousands of prisoners were worked to death. With the increased persecution of the Jews, the number of prisoners at the camp increased in the late Thirties. It was the original model for all concentration camps - divided into barracks, workshops and areas where medical experiments took place and the crematorium. However it is believed that rather than gas chambers, the Nazis used this area as a firing range and gallows for most prisoners. Those who were deemed too sick or old to work were sent to Hartheim in Austria where they faced the gas chambers. Thousands of prisoners from Dachau died in this way. Hundreds of prisoners died or were left disabled during horrific medical experiments at Dachau which included malaria, hypothermia and tuberculosis trials, new medications and methods to stop excessive bleeding. More than 188,000 prisoners passed through the heavy gates of Dachau in its 12-year history. Although 28,000 were known to have died, there were many, many more victims who have never been accounted for. The octogenarian, who came to the U.S. as an orphan in 1948, even went on TV show Unsolved Mysteries in the hope of finding the man. In August this year, he received a phone call from a woman named Brenda Clark - Mr Sattler's grand-daughter - who said Mr Ross's story resembled one she had been told. Mr Sattler had spoken little about his time during the liberation of Dachau. However he did once tell his daughter Gwen Allanson that he had given food and 'something else' to a young boy at the German concentration camp. Mr Sattler did not say what he had given the boy, only that he 'hoped it helped him'. After the families compared details of Mr Sattler's service with Mr Ross's memories, the personal histories matched up. Mr Ross, a retired psychologist, told the Globe: 'I recalled thinking: ''If this is true, there is some God in this world.''' He shared his stories of being held in a Nazi prison camp which left him starved and beaten within an inch of his life. Mr Ross lost his entire family in the Holocaust apart from one brother. Sattler was a member of the 191st Tank Battalion who were part . of the troops who liberated Dachau, about ten miles northwest of Munich . in southern Germany. The U.S. forces who breached the gates of Dachau in April, 1945 were faced with thousands of starving prisoners, many near death. The soldiers also came across the gruesome discovery of 30 railroad cars piled high with bodies. From its establishment in 1933 until the camp was liberated in 1945, more than 188,000 prisoners passed through the heavy gates of Dachau. At least 28,000 people died within its walls although the exact number who lost their lives under its regime will never likely be known.

"By . Chris Parsons . Updated: . 04:44 EST, 28 January 2012 . They are some of the world's greatest ever horse racing names, but new research has suggested that the likes of Seabiscuit, Man O'War, Secretariat and Seattle Slew may all have a distant genetic connection. Researchers have claimed that all the best thoroughbreds of racing are all very distantly related after tracing the 'speed gene' they all share to a single ancestor from the 17th century. Experts at University College Dublin analysed DNA from nearly 600 horses and 22 modern breeds, and were able to predict what the horses had in common genetically. Scientists analysing horse DNA traced the 'speed gene' back to a single British mare in the 17th century . Their results showed how the 'speed gene' which saw racing greats like Man O'War and Seabiscuit power to victory was passed to the famous horses from a single founder, a British mare around 300 years ago. The British ancestor was racing in the mid-17th century at a time when local British breeds were pre-eminent in racing horses and before the foundation of the thoroughbred racehorse. In finding the 'speed gene', a C type myostatin gene variant, researchers studied genetic data from hundreds of horses, as well as the skeletal remains of 12 thoroughbred stallions born between 1764 and 1930. Their research also included DNA from 330 elite performing thoroughbreds, 40 donkeys and two zebras. Legend: U.S. thoroughbred Seattle Slew remains the only horse to win the Triple Crown while undefeated . Iconic: Man O'War, thought to be one of the greatest thoroughbreds of all time, won 20 of his 21 races. Record breaker: U.S. horse Secretariat set records in two Triple Crown races which still stand to this day . Famous: Seabiscuit became the subject of a book and two films followings its success . Modern variants recently traced successful thoroughbreds back to legendary mare Nearctic, who lived between 1954 and 1973. The variant branched out to Nearctic's son Northern Dancer, which according to LiveScience was the most bred stallion of modern times. Norther Dancer never finished lower than third and won 14 of his 18 races. But the new research has now traced the success of modern thoroughbreds back to a single horse over 300 years ago. Researcher Emmeline Hill, a genomics scientist at University College Dublin who led the study, said: 'Changes in racing since the foundation of the Thoroughbred have shaped the distribution of 'speed gene' types over time and in different racing regions. Research: Dr Emmeline Hill, pictured with Irish trainer Jim Bolger, conducted the study to discover the genetic links between successful thoroughbreds . 'But we have been able to identify that the original 'speed gene' variant entered the Thoroughbred from a single founder, which was most likely a British mare about 300 years ago. 'Having first identified the 'speed gene' in 2010, we decided to see if we could trace the origin of the gene variant using population genetics coupled with pedigree analysis. 'We wanted to understand where speed in the Thoroughbred came from.' Researchers said all great sprinting horses shared two genes associated with muscle development. The genetic combination was not present in regular farm horses, donkeys or zebras.","Gene traced back to single 17th century British mare .

"By . Taylor Auerbach . When allegations of drug possession were levelled at Sara Huegill on Saturday April 26, the news sent whispers rippling through the Sydney public relations industry. The stylish publicist, who now runs her own boutique firm Row A PR, was charged alongside husband Geoff with possessing an illicit drug at Royal Randwick. The pair were allegedly found in a suite at the races with a small quantity of white powder which police claim was cocaine. ‘Karma’s a b***h,’ said one former workmate, who added that the industry was squirming with rumours about the 30-year-old. Scroll down for video . You're fired!: Sara Huegill (right) was terminated from her role at Sweaty Betty PR in 2010. She is pictured here with husband Geoff at a David Jones fashion launch last year . ‘I am aware of these rumours, and equally aware of the tactics employed by some unscrupulous industry participants to undermine potential competitors,’ Ms Huegill told MailOnline via email. When the news broke, many of her ex-colleagues were quick to delve into Ms Huegill’s work history and her career as a publicist was the subject of gossip for days. Much of it was untrue. But MailOnline can now reveal Ms Huegill was sacked from her job at Sweaty Betty PR for sending sporting compression wear and supplements to an 'unknown identity' in Rose Bay in 2010 without authorisation from her bosses or the firm’s client. Evidence suggests Ms Huegill was terminated from her PR job at Sweaty Betty for 'dishonest conduct' relating to the handling of stock belonging to Nathan Picklum, owner of fitness wear and supplement business Body Science. According to a letter dated ‘22nd July 2010’, Ms Huegill (Ms Hills at the time) was sacked with immediate effect after '$850 worth of Body Science product (was) dispatched without consent to an unknown identity.' According to documents, the intended recipient was a 'Matt Aboud' of Rose Bay. It is understood it was the same Matt Abood who lives in Rose Bay and is a member of the Australian national swimming team. PR war: Roxy Jacenko (pictured) fired Sara Huegill from Sweaty Betty PR in 2010 for 'disloyal conduct' The Aboods are close friends with the Huegills and invited them to their wedding in December 2013. Mr Abood's wife Hayley has also 'liked' Sweaty Betty PR on her Facebook account. It is not suggested Matt Abood, a relay world champion, ever consumed unauthorised supplements or that the Aboods knew that anything was sent to them without authorisation. A staffer at the courier company tasked with delivering the stock to Rose Bay confirmed it was dispatched but said 'the stock was returned to Sweaty Betty PR' in Alexandria on 21 July 2010 when the listed recipient told the courier he had the ‘wrong phone number’. According to the Body Science website, Australian swimmers James Magnussen and Eamon Sullivan are both clients. Body Science also supplies to eight NRL clubs and five AFL clubs. Glamour couple: Geoff and Sara Huegill are currently waiting to front court, charged with possessing what police allege was cocaine . Last year Body Science owner Nathan Picklum, in an interview about drugs in sport, told The Sydney Morning Herald: ‘We're very stringent. We have to be, we can't afford even a one in a million chance we might compromise an athlete. Our products are tested at Bond University (in Queensland) and in the UK because they have the most stringent testing procedures over there.’ Asked about her relationship with Abood, Ms Huegill said: ‘Matt Abood is a friend but also part of my broader professional network as a sportsperson with profile in a position to potentially endorse client product.’ Unauthorised recipient: Australian swimmer Matt Abood (pictured) is understood to have been the intended recipient of the 'unauthorised' Body Science products . A letter to Sara Huegill from her then boss Roxy Jacenko has been obtained in which the publicity queen and Celebrity Apprentice star said: ‘I am most upset and distressed by what has occurred within the business today – . ‘The bag of Body Science product was in fact sent yesterday July 20 2010 And returned to me personally at 8am this morning. ‘Not only was it sent with NO approval, it was sent on an express courier. ‘(The) email for approval to giveaway product was sent to our client after the product had been sent to Matt Aboud at the Rose Bay address as per the label. ‘This was also after you denied any knowledge of sending any Body Science product out of the Sweaty Betty PR offices and replied “no no I haven’t sent anything to that person"".' PR queen: Jacenko fired Ms Huegill with immediate effect in July 2010, documents reveal . A source said there is rampant speculation that Ms Huegill inspired Jacenko’s fictional ‘sticky-fingered publicist’ character in her first novel as a result of the incident. Ms Huegill has since removed Sweaty Betty PR from her list of employers on LinkedIn. In response to MailOnline’s direct question about the Body Science incident, Ms Huegill wrote the following: ‘It was well known at the time that Ms Jacenko was actively looking to terminate my employment for reasons mostly unrelated to performance. ‘In the end, the basis of my termination from Sweaty Betty PR, was that I had not sought express authorisation from Ms Jacenko to distribute samples of client product to a third-party despite the distribution of client product to potential third-party endorsers being something the industry survives on and something Sweaty Betty PR did every single day.’ Deliberate attempts: Stylish PR professional Sara Huegill claims rumours about her in the industry are attempts at 'undermining' her . After Sweaty Betty, she worked at Trend Imports and Glue Store, where Kathryn Diprose told MailOnline: ‘Sara Huegill ceased working with any of our brands over 12 months ago, we won't be commenting on anything.’ She also previously worked at Impact Communications. An Impact spokeswoman said Ms Huegill ‘decided that she wanted to pursue the dream of working in fashion PR’ and left voluntarily. Ms Huegill said: ‘Having seen the success Geoff has achieved in all levels of life through hard work and running his own brand, it made sense to me that if I wanted to achieve that level of success I had to be in control of my own profession, hence it makes sense to be my own boss.’ Asked about Saturday’s drug possession charge, Ms Huegill said: ‘I don’t have anything to add to the comments Geoff made yesterday, sorry.’ Roxy Jacenko, also via email, said the following: ‘Sara Hills was dismissed for disloyal conduct – one can play it or manipulate it any way they want but that’s the start and finish of why she was terminated from her employment at Sweaty Betty PR. ‘It was I must say a shame as we did enjoy her company and she was a good publicist.’ Sport science: The Body Science website lists a number of Aussie swimmers as clients .

"By . Chris Pleasance . LA Lakers legend Magic Johnson has tweeted his joy after the team announced head coach Mike D'Antoni is resigning . LA Lakers legend Magic Johnson said he 'couldn't be happier' after the team announced head coach Mike D'Antoni would be resigning earlier today. The former player and current ESPN pundit, who has been a vocal critic of D'Antoni, tweeted: 'Happy days are here again! Mike D'Antoni resigns as the Lakers coach. I couldn't be happier!' The injury-plagued Lakers were 27-55 this . season, their worst campaign in more than 50 years and the second-worst . winning percentage in franchise history. The drop in form represents a harsh fall-from-grace for one of the NBA's proudest and most successful franchises. As of summer 2012, shortly before D'Antoni joined, the team held the NBA record for most wins, highest winning percentage, and greatest number of NBA finals appearances. Team spokesman John Black confirmed D'Antoni's resignation, ending the brief tenure of the Lakers' fourth head coach in less than three years. D'Antoni went 67-87 after taking over the Lakers early in the 2012-13 season. He replaced the fired Mike Brown, who lasted just 71 games after replacing 11-time NBA champion coach Phil Jackson in 2011. Since the start of D'Antoni's tenure at the head of the Lakers, Johnson has been an outspoken critic. When his appointment was announced Johnson used twitter to say he was in 'mourning' that the Lakers had not decided to re-hire Phil Jackson, who won five championships during his 11-year career at the head of the team. Johnson regularly used his role as an ESPN analyst to criticise everything from D'Antoni's strategy, defensive tactics and offensive pick-and-roll style. As recently as January this year, Johnson used an appearance on Tonight With Jay Leno to take a swipe at D'Antoni, but shortly afterwards said he was going to stop complaining about the team, as it wasn't doing 'the players, coaches or ownership' any good. With Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash and Pau Gasol sitting out large chunks of the season while the Lakers lost an NBA-worst 319 man-games to injuries, the 16-time NBA champion franchise missed the playoffs for the first time in nine seasons and only the third time in 38 years. Scroll down for video . Mike D'Antoni took over the Lakers at the start of the 2012-13 seasons, but since then the team has failed to perform at its best. They were 27-55 this season, their worst campaign for more than 50 years . Happy days: Johnson, former Lakers player and ESPN analyst, has been critical of D'Antoni's coaching style . 'Given the . circumstances, I don't know that anybody could have done a better job . than Mike did the past two seasons,' Lakers general manager Mitch . Kupchak said. 'On . behalf of the Lakers, we thank Mike for the work ethic, professionalism . and positive attitude that he brought to the team every day. We wish . him the best of luck.' The 62-year-old D'Antoni had one year left on his contract, but wanted the Lakers to pick up his option year for 2015-16 to have any chance of success. The Lakers apparently refused, leading to D'Antoni's resignation. D'Antoni walked away from a $4 million payday for next season, although he may receive a portion of that money as severance. A phone message left for D'Antoni wasn't immediately returned. Despite the Lakers' injuries on a roster consisting mostly of players on one-year contracts, Los Angeles fans largely directed their anger during a rare down season toward D'Antoni. D'Antoni also has coached the Nuggets, Suns and Knicks. He reached two Western Conference finals with Nash in Phoenix before having much less success in New York. 'Whenever a coach isn't there anymore, for whatever reason, all of us in the fraternity feel badly,' San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said after the Spurs' playoff victory over Dallas. 'He is a heck of a coach and heck of a guy. You always feel badly when something like that happens. I just hope that what he wants is going to be what happens for him. He is a special guy.' D'Antoni's signature up-tempo style of play seemed an odd match from the start with the aging, ball-dominating Bryant and the Lakers, who ran Jackson's deliberate triangle offense to perfection. Lakers owners Jerry and Jim Buss curiously chose D'Antoni to replace Brown over Jackson, who strongly contemplated a return for a third stint on the Los Angeles bench. Jackson became the president of the Knicks in March. The Lakers have been plagued by injuries this season, with (from left to right) Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Steve Nash all consigned to the bench for large chunks of the campaign . Kupchak said he will begin the search immediately for the Lakers' fifth head coach since 2011 - including Jackson, who walked away from the team after falling short of a third consecutive championship. D'Antoni's departure will allow the Lakers' franchise overhaul to begin in earnest after their worst season since 1957-58 back in Minneapolis. Los Angeles missed the postseason for just the second time in the 17-season career of Bryant, who occasionally clashed with D'Antoni. The Lakers have a top-10 pick in a strong draft and just three players under contract for next season, including Nash and Bryant. The fourth-leading scorer in NBA history will make more than $48 million over the next two years. A coaching change also might make the Lakers more attractive to Gasol, an unrestricted free agent who intimated he wouldn't consider returning if D'Antoni still coached the team. Kupchak has said the Lakers are very interested in re-signing the 7-foot Spaniard, one of the top available free agents. 'There would have to be significant changes,' Gasol wrote in Spanish on his personal blog recently. 'I've never concealed the fact that D'Antoni's style doesn't suit my game. Everybody knows this. 'I don't know if my decision will be swayed by whether Mike stays or leaves. Obviously, the coach is a very important factor for any team.' After joining the Lakers on short notice last season, D'Antoni was unable to assemble a contending team immediately around Bryant and Dwight Howard, who struggled to embrace the pick-and-roll game so important to D'Antoni's offense. Johnson has criticised D-Antoni's pick-and-roll style offence, as have several team members, including Gasol . D'Antoni had a three year contract, but had been asking the Lakers to pick his option year for 2015-16, which they apparently refused, leading to his resignation . Los Angeles won 45 games last season despite its awful start under Brown. But the Lakers lost Bryant to a torn Achilles tendon late in the regular season before getting swept out of the first round by San Antonio. Howard left the Lakers as a free agent last summer, fleeing to Houston for less money to escape the Lakers' drama and high expectations. Bryant played in just six games this season after breaking a bone near his knee in December, and Los Angeles never had a consistently competitive team in his absence. Nash also missed most of the season with various injuries, but the 40-year-old point guard hopes to play again next season. D'Antoni realized he would take the blame for the Lakers' woes this season, and the veteran coach seemed comfortable with the prospect when the team packed up for the summer. 'Every coach should be under scrutiny,' D'Antoni said two weeks ago. 'Some coaches get fired even after the best years they've ever had. ... There's always things we could have done better, and it's easier with hindsight. 'Things don't always go smoothly. For the most part, our guys were very competitive. For us, there are some silver linings in there, but in hindsight, it's disappointing for everybody.'","Lakers head coach Mike D'Antoni resigns after worst campaign in 50 years .

"By . Julian Robinson . A fierce fire has ripped through the dome of a luxury five-star hotel in the Italian city of Venice. Smoke was seen billowing from the roof of the historic Excelsior Hotel which overlooks the lagoon in the famous European tourism destination. Fire fighters spent five hours tackling the blaze at the building, which once hosted Hitler when he met Mussolini on his first state visit to the country. Up in smoke: Smoke could be seen for miles around after fire broke out in the dome of the hotel at midday . Teams of fire fighters spent five hours trying to put out the flames after 100 guests had to evacuated from the historic building . More than 100 guests at the hotel, where rooms cost around £300-a-night, were evacuated when fire alarms went off. Fire engines descended on the scene and went about tackling the flames, which had also spread to a number of wooden and plywood tables in the hotel, which opened in 1908. It has been reported by Nuova Venezia how that section of the building had been closed while work was going on to build a honeymoon suite. The smoke could be seen for miles around in Venice after flames took hold. This picture was taken from across the lagoon in the famous European tourism destination . Investigations are ongoing to try and determine the cause of the fire. The building was refurbished in 2013 and is popular with film stars attending the Venice Film Festival . Flames appeared just after midday today engulfing the entire 'Cupola' dome. It is thought it started in the San Marco suite, which has 360 degree views of the sea and lagoon, Corriere della Sera reports. It is not yet clear how much damage was caused and what started the blaze, but an investigation has been launched. No one is believed to have been injured. The hotel is set on the beach at Venice Lido and features a large heated outdoor pool as well as a free regular boat service taking guests across the lagoon to St Mark's Square. It was refurbished in 2013 with new tapestries and carpets and a gym. In the past, the hotel has played host to a number of celebrities attending the Venice film festival.

"By . Ryan Lipman . A Northern Territory man tried to illegally sell a wallaby joey on Facebook. The animal was rescued uninjured from a Broome car park by  Department of Parks and Wildlife officers and Western Australia Police last Thursday. Despite the sale being illegal, the man advertised the joey for $3,500 (Â£1,926) and received an offer of up to $10,000 (Â£5,500) from a visiting overseas buyer. Shocking: A Western Australia Parks and Wildlife Department officer seized a wallaby joey (pictured), which was rescued from a Broome car park after it was posted for sale on Facebook . A wildlife officer took part in a covert operation to seize the animal, by posing as a potential buyer in plain clothes. Wildlife officer Peter Carstairs said the 26-year-old man would be charged with offences including possession, importation and selling of protected wildlife. 'It is illegal to sell or possess any part of a native animal in Western Australia unless you have a wildlife licence,' he said. The man imported the wallaby from the Northern Territory into Western Australia, where he then tried to sell using Facebook. A Parks and Wildlife spokeswoman said it was not known how the man got the joey or how long he had it for. Outrage: The animal attracted bids as high as 10,000 before the man was caught (Wallaby pictured) 'There is a black market trade in Australian wildlife and it is a practice that must be stopped,' Mr Carstairs said. The department was altered to the man's actions after residents' concerns, which lead them to make complaints. 'The community outrage generated by this incident shows that people really care about protecting our native wildlife,' he said. The man could be charged with up to five offences under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 and face penalties of up to $4,000 (Â£2,200) for some charges. The spokeswoman said the wallaby was being cared for by a wildlife rehabilitator, but sustained no significant injury in the man's care. Black market trade: A Parks and Wildlife spokeswoman said it was not rare for people to attempt to sell native Australian animals, such as the pictured wallabies, on social media and consumer sites such as Gumtree (library image) 'It's diet while in the man's care wasn't great,' she said. 'It's now healthy and doing great.' The animal is expected to soon be returned to the Northern Territory when rehabilitation treatment finishes. 'We will contact our counterpart agency in the Northern Territory to arrange the wallaby's return,' she said. The spokeswoman said incidents of people using social media and sites such as Gumtree to sell native animals was not rare. 'It's something that does happen... It's not a new thing,' she said. Last year, a Japanese man was caught trying to smuggle lizards from the state. 'He received a suspended sentence and a fine. He was trying to take them from Western Australia back to Japan because they're quite valuable there,' she said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Misconduct hearing: Tamitha Grey, 46, allegedly allowed her 10-year-old son to start an X-ray machine on a schoolgirl in Haverfordwest . A hospital radiographer  let her ten-year-old son start an X-ray on a patient, a disciplinary hearing was told yesterday. The boy asked Tamitha Grey, 46: ‘Are we ready yet, mum?’ She replied ‘No . . . OK’, and he pushed the button to switch on the machine. Nicola Jones, the mother of the 15-year-old patient, said: ‘It was an incredible thing to see. I still can’t believe it happened. ‘After I got home I just could not stop thinking about it.’ The boy was then taken away and Mrs Grey performed a second X-ray on the teenage girl, who had a suspected broken wrist. Mrs Jones, who works as an ultrasound technician at the same hospital, said: ‘It’s a very private environment, and it was a surprise to see him there just totally out  of context.’ She said she did not realise the gravity of the situation until later, adding: ‘At the time, I would have felt uncomfortable that he was there, but my priorities were my own daughter.’ Mrs Grey took her son with her to work at Withybush Hospital  in Pembrokeshire, Wales, when  his after-school rugby match was  cancelled, the hearing in Cardiff was told. She admitted allowing an unqualified person to initiate the exposure of a patient to  ionising radiation on May 9 last year, and permitting a member of the public to be present at a clinical examination. But she denied that her fitness to practise had been affected by her actions. She has already received a final written warning from Hywel Dda Health Board following an earlier internal investigation.

"By . Damien Gayle . The man who inspired Jeff Bridges' Big Lebowski character The Dude is suing the hospital where his mother died for $10million. Hollywood film producer Jeff Dowd, 65, claims poor communication between doctors caused his mother's rapid decline and death at UCLA Medical Centre. She was admitted to the hospital with bronchitis last March and was dead within a month after suffering internal bleeding, dehydration and, finally, a massive stroke, the lawsuit says. The original Dude: Jeff Dowd speaks at the 2014 Lebowski Fest in Los Angeles last week. The Hollywood producer is suing UCLA Medical Centre, claiming poor communication led to his mother's death there . Dowd told TMZ his mother was handed from one doctor to another without proper briefings on the medication she was taking, a breakdown in communication that he believes led to her death. Dowd's anger at his mother's death, and his determination to do something about it, seems to be a long way from his laid-back depiction in the Joel and Ethan Coen's film The Big Lebowski. Released in 1998 but set in the early '90s, the film tells the story of Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski, an unemployed LA slacker who, after a case of mistaken identity, finds himself embroiled in a kidnap for ransom plot. Although the plot is fictional, and loosely based on the work of crime novellist Raymond Chandler, the character of The Dude is based on Dowd, who had long worked with the Coen Brothers. Dowd has said that Jeff Bridges' portrayal of The Dude - his own nickname from sixth-grade - is accurate, right down to the body language. 'Lemme say something about Jeff. I'm born on November 20, 1949, Jeff is born on December 3, 1949,' he told Huffington Post last year. 'This means, every time he heard a song for the first time growing up, whether it was in sixth grade, or eighth grade, or tenth grade, that was the same day I heard it for the first time. 'So we're very closely hooked ... and he's a stoner too, so it wasn't a stretch for Jeff to play me. In terms of philosophically, spiritually, all that kind of stuff, that's who he kind of naturally is.' Bridges was actually born on December 4. Dowd fell in with the Coen Brothers when they were promoting their first film Blood Simple in 1984. His idiosyncratic character inspired the character of The Dude in The Big Lebowski, played by Jeff Bridges, right . Not a slacker: Dowd is regarded in Hollywood as a film marketing and distribution guru, as well as working as a producer, a writer, and helping Robert Redford start the Sundance Film Festival . But although The Big Lebowski's Dude is an inveterate slacker, the real Dude could not be further from lazy. He is also no stranger to activism. In the 1970s he first shot into the public eye as a member of the Seattle Seven. That was a group of young radicals who were indicted on charges of inciting riot in connection with a violent anti-Vietnam War protest. Although he was briefly jailed for contempt of court, he and his co-defendants were cleared of the riot charges after government witnesses admitted they would 'go to any length' to fight the radicals. Some years later Dowd moved to Los Angeles, where he fell in with the then relatively unknown Coen Brothers while they were promoting their first film Blood Simple in 1984. Since then, he has earned an enviable reputation as a film marketing and distribution guru, as well as working as a producer and producer's representative, a writer, and helping Robert Redford start the Sundance Film Festival. Now, spurred on by his mother's treatment, Dowd is turning some of that energy towards righting the wrongs he perceives in America's healthcare industry. He says he wants to reform the way that medical staff communicate and, in so doing, save hundreds of thousands of people he says die every year from similar kinds of failures.

"By . Richard Spillett . The son of an Indian millionaire died after taking lethal 'bodybuilding tablets' made with chemicals used in First World War explosives. Sarmad Alladin, 18, accidentally killed himself after taking deadly DNP - which is sold on the internet as a fitness aid but is described by experts as 'extremely dangerous to human health'. An inquest in Woking, Surrey heard Mr Alladin had made bodybuilding 'the main aim in his life' and dreamed of playing international rugby for India. Sarmad Alladin died after taking deadly 'bodybuilding' tablets he bought over the internet, an inquest has heard . The teenager, an international student at Epsom's University for the Creative Arts (UCA), died in Epsom Hospital in February last year after taking DNP - a fat-burning drug which he bought over the internet from an unknown source. Police drugs experts have said the chemical - made from the industrial 2,4-Dinitrophenol - is extremely dangerous and was used in explosives in the First World War. Mr Alladin, the son of an Indian millionaire originally from Hyderabad, called 999 at 3.25am on February 13 last year, saying he had stomach pains and a high temperature. An ambulance took him to Epsom Hospital, where he died at 6.20am. Police investigating his death later found pots of pills and tablets in his room - including DNP - as well as needles and many different bodybuilding supplements. Repeating written evidence of a paramedic who treated Mr Alladin, Coroner Michael Burgess said: 'The deceased admitted taking DNP to lose weight, purchased from the internet.' Mr Alladin's family flew to the UK from Hyderabad after his death in February last year . The inquest heard Mr Alladin used a range of bodybuilding aids because he wanted to play rugby for India . Dr Ali Alhakim, who conducted a post-mortem examination, said his death was caused by the taking of DNP. Toxicology tests found there was 201mg per litre of DNP in his blood - 'a high concentration', Dr Alhakim said. He told the coroner that Mr Alladin had stretch marks on his shoulders, chest and his back, suggesting a recent increase in muscle mass beneath the skin. Dr Alhakim said he could not sure how long Mr Alladin has been taking the drugs for. Mr Alladin, whose family did not attend the inquest, had attended the independent King's School in Rochester, Kent before starting at UCA Epsom in October 2012. Daniel James, who studied with Mr Alladin in Rochester and Epsom, said that keeping in good physical shape became 'the main aim in his life' when he started at UCA. Police investigating Mr Alladin's death found tubs of pills in his university room, whose walls were adorned with pictures of famous bodybuilders . He put posters of bodybuilders including Arnold Schwarznegger on the walls of his university room, the inquest heard. Mr James added: 'I'm not sure anyone knew him that much. He never really spoke about his parents or family.' Mr James said that when speaking of DNP, Mr Alladin gave the impression that he 'knew what he was doing'. Dr Jenny Newell, Mr Alladin's former GP, said she saw the art and design student 'pumped up' nine months before his death. She said she had warned Mr Alladin about using the drugs, but he was determined to build up his body to get into sports teams. Mr Alladin was advised by his doctors to stop using the drugs and police have warned about DNP - which was once used in explosives . She told . the inquest: 'I was alarmed by the number of medications he had in his . possession. He had ordered various things over the internet. 'I told . him what he was doing was stupid and dangerous but he was resolute in . his belief that these were necessary to get him into the Indian rugby . team.' It is believed DNP has caused around 60 deaths worldwide.The Food . Standards Agency has issued urgent advice to the public, . particularly the body-building community, about the pills, which are . described as 'extremely dangerous to human health'. DNP . is sold over the internet and marketed at bodybuilders and dieters as a . way to boost their metabolism. Although banned for . human consumption, is not illegal to sell. DNP user Chris Mapletoft, 18, died in June last year, just one day after taking his last A-level exam. His mother has since called for the drug to be made illegal. Sarah Houston, 23, who suffered from an eating . disorder, also died after taking the drug to lose weight while she was . studying at Leeds University. Campaigners have called for DNP to be classified as a class-C drug so possession of the pills would be a crime. She . said the teen's tragic death 'wasn't a surprise' to her because he had . told her he had 'tons and tons of stuff', including serums from India to . inject into his body. Mr Alladin's GP in Epsom, Dr Nigel McKee, said it was clear that he was taking bodybuilding drugs and other supplements. Dr McKee told the hearing: 'There was quite a lot of talk about how he was a disappointment to his family and he implied his father was a bodybuilder and he wanted to emulate him.' Giving his verdict, Mr Burgess said: 'His death was due to accident. The unintentional consequences of an action that he initiated himself.' After the verdict, David Campbell, a drugs expert for Surrey Police, said that in his 35 years in the position this was the first time he had ever come across DNP. He said: 'DNP was an explosive used in the First World War. It can come in various guises. In powder form it is very volatile and dangerous.' Commenting on Mr Alladin's death, Dr Simon Olfield-Kerr, vice-chancellor of UCA, has said all students have since been issued with a warning about the drug.","Sarmad Alladin died after taking DNP - a deadly drug sold over the internet .

"By . Sam Webb . The £500million redevelopment of the BBC's former HQ in west London will include a plush private members' club, a rooftop pool and terrace and a hotel, it has been revealed. Television Centre in White City, which was sold by the corporation for £200million in 2012, will host a branch of Soho House, a private members' club for those in film, media and the creative industries which has expanded to include clubs, hotels, restaurants and spas across the world. Developers Stanhope said it hopes to start the redevelopment, which has outline planning for about 950 homes, offices, shops and restaurants, in April next year. Revamp: The £500million redevelopment of Television Centre, the BBC's former HQ in west London, will include a private members' club, a rooftop pool and terrace and a hotel. Pictured, an artist's impression of how the site will look . Desirable: Developer Stanhope paid £200million for a 999-year lease on the site in July 2012. Pictured is the developer's vision for the finished site, which will include offices, homes and leisure facilities . The revamp will keep many of the original features of the listed buildings including the famous ‘doughnut’, atomic dot wall and statue of Helios. However, some buildings will be demolished and replaced with a new ten-storey office building, which will house the club, swimming pool and roof terrace for Soho House. The BBC will remain at Television Centre operating three studios through its commercial subsidiaries BBC Studios and Post Production and BBC Worldwide, which will be based at Television Centre, following a refurbishment from early 2015. Partner: Soho House will design and operate part of the scheme to provide 47 bedrooms, a roof terrace, swimming pool and restaurant at the White City scheme. Pictured, how the iconic frontage could look . Nick Jones, CEO of Soho House, said: 'The area has a rich and varied tradition of creative talent and the development of Television Centre will provide a worthy addition to the area and a new home from home for member’s to work and relax in.' David Camp, CEO of Stanhope, said:  'Since we received planning permission at the end of last year we have been looking in more detail at how we can realise our vision for Television Centre as a vibrant heart to the wider White City district of London.' Stanhope paid £200million for a 999-year lease on the site in July 2012. BBC Television Centre officially opened in June 1960 and is recognised throughout the UK and the world . Many of the site's famous features, such as the the famous 'doughnut' shape and atomic dot wall, will remain . The BBC finally left the building in March 2013 despite bitter opposition from many of its own stars, including Michael Parkinson and comedian David Mitchell. The corporation spent an estimated £224million setting up a new northern base - MediaCityUK in Salford - to help redress a perceived London-centric bias in its coverage, although the BBC says it is closer to £180million when the savings from relinquishing property in London is taken into account. The lifetime budgeted cost of relocation . and operating costs up to 2030 for Salford is £942million, or £573 million taking inflation into account. The radio and television news departments moved to Broadcasting House in central London, the home of BBC Radio, between July 2012 and March 2013.","The BBC sold the site to developers for £200million in 2012 .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Banned for life Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling’s trail of scorned women and legal battles is only getting longer. Lawsuits attributed to Sterling’s philandering go back to at least 2002, when he and long-suffering wife Rochelle sued Alexandra Castro to recover all of the gifts he lavished on her during their affair. The suit is nearly identical to the one filed by Rochelle Sterling against Vanessa Stiviano, 31, to recover the various luxury cars, money and an apartment husband bought for the much younger woman by her husband. Scroll down for video . Better days: Donald Sterling in a 2011 picture taken with Vanessa Stiviano . Sterling, 80, claimed in court depositions that the now 42-year-old Castro was a gold-digging ‘prostitute’  who was ‘a piece of trash’ that always ‘wanted to pull something and have sex,’ according to documents posted to The Smoking Gun. ‘That's all it was is sex, nothing more, nothing less. I didn't want to have any more sex with her. I couldn't physically,’ he told the court. She performed oral sex 'all night long, Sterling continued. '[Her] best sex was better than words could express... it was purely sex for money, money for sex, sex for money, money for sex.' The vile rant was in response to Castro fighting Rochelle Sterling’s demands to return a Rodeo Drive home the mistress claims was bought for her in return for catering to the tycoon’s every need. Castro explained in court that Sterling was ‘very demanding’ and ‘very particular’ even when it came to his socks. ‘He gave me specific instructions on how to remove his socks, and if I did not do it exactly the way he wanted his socks removed, he would order me to put them back on and do it over again,’ she said. Claw back: Sterling is trying to take back the luxurious gifts he lavished on Stiviano, including this Ferrari . Sterling promised to ‘purchase the residence and pay for all of the remodeling, furnishings, and all other expenses, including any taxes,’ Castro claimed. He told her to put the property in her and her mother’s name after buying it so he had a place to visit her – she provided as evidence a picture of Sterling in the apartment in only his underwear, documents showed. The soon-to-be former team owner also took Castro on trips around the world and paid her a monthly allowance of $4,500, she said. But that spigot of generosity was cut off when their relationship ended in the summer of 2002.She soon moved on, but the real estate tycoon had not. Castro claimed that he tried to rekindle their arrangement, but she wasn’t interested. The Sterlings responded with a strikingly similar lawsuit to the one filed by Rochelle Sterling against Stiviano. Sterling threatened Castro that ‘he would file a lawsuit against me to get back everything he had given me and that he would force me to hire attorneys and spend everything I owned so that I would go broke, and be forced to return to him for financial support,’ she said. Not smiling now: Sterling has been banned from the NBA as a result of his racially-charged comments . The mogul eventually reached a private settlement with his former mistress and even paid her legal fees after her lawyers claimed the payout deal was done behind their back, according to ABC News. His lawyer represented Castro when hers took her to court over the unpaid fees. Castro also infamously lived with boxer Mike Tyson prior to meeting Donald Sterling in 1999. The legal wrangling over the Ferrari, two Bentleys, a range rover, an apartment and about $250,000 cash given to Stiviano by Sterling is only just beginning. Stiviano denies she leaked the recordings that brought life as Sterling knew it to an end.She also insists their relationship wasn’t romantic. The suit has yet to reach a courtroom, and attorneys for both Castro and Sterling declined comment.","Donald Sterling and his wife sued former mistress in Alexandra Castro in 2002 after their relationship went south .

"By . Associated Press . Handwritten lyrics for Bob Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone', one of the most popular songs of all time, are going under the hammer this summer and could fetch a record $2 million. Sotheby's is offering a working draft of the finished song in Dylan's own hand for an estimated $1 million to $2 million. The previous record sale for lyrics sold were from the John Lennon song 'A Day in the Life' The song is about a debutante who becomes a loner when she's cast from upper-class social circles. How does it feel? Sotheby's is auctioning off a working draft of Bob Dylan's Like a Rolling Stone, one of the most popular songs of all time . Like a complete unknown: The draft, in Dylan's barely legible scrawl, is up for sale on June 24, with estimates it could fetch as much as $2 million . You never understood that it ain't no good: Dylan was only 24 when he recorded the song in 1965 . With no direction home: The lyrics contain a number of doodles, including what appears to be a bowler hat as well as the name Al Capone scrawled in the margin . You've gone to the finest school: The stationery comes from the Roger Smith hotel in Washington DC . Bob Dylan backstage at De Montford Hall, Leicester in the 1960s . The draft is written in pencil on four sheets of hotel letterhead stationery with revisions, additions, notes and doodles: a hat, a bird, an animal with antlers. The stationery comes from the Roger Smith hotel in Washington, D.C. 'How does it feel To be on your own' it says in his scrawled handwriting. 'No direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone.' Scrawls seem to reflect the artist's experimentation with rhymes. The name 'Al Capone' is scrawled in the margin, with a line leading to the lyrics 'Like a complete unknown.' Another note says: '...dry vermouth, you'll tell the truth...' Dylan was only 24 when he recorded the song in 1965. The auction is June 24 as part of Sotheby's rock and pop music sale. Experts at the auction house have described it as 'the most significant piece of rock material to appear at auction.' Sotheby's described the seller as a longtime fan from California 'who met his hero in a non-rock context and bought directly from Dylan.' He was not identified. Sotheby's says it is 'the only known surviving draft of the final lyrics for this transformative rock anthem.' In 2010, John Lennon's handwritten lyrics for 'A Day in the Life,' the final track on the Beatles' classic 1967 album 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,' sold for $1.2 million, the record for such a sale.

"By . Mark Duell . The calamitous little-known tale of how a Royal Navy submarine sank at its own mooring when blundering crewmen accidentally left its hatches open was today revealed. HMS Artemis was about to be refuelled at a wet dock in Gosport, Hampshire, in July 1971 when the 280ft vessel began sinking to the horror of her crew. Hapless submariners had forgotten to shut the torpedo loading bay and the rear escape hatch was also left open so that power cables could be run through to the control room. Refloated: The calamitous little-known tale of how Royal Navy submarine HMS Artemis sank at its own mooring when blundering crewmen left its hatches open has come to light . Sinking: HMS Artemis was about to be refuelled in a wet dock in in Gosport, Hampshire, in July 1971 when the 280ft vessel began sinking to the horror of her crew . Rescued from the sinking vessel: Hapless submariners had forgotten to shut the torpedo loading bay and the rear escape hatch was also left open so that power cables could be run through to the control room . To safety: Duty Petty Officer David Guest is helped ashore from the sunken Artemis. Seawater had gushed through the torpedo bay at the stern and then the open hatch above it . As her fuel tanks were flooded with water in readiness to take on fuel, the vessel sat lower in the water. Seawater began gushing through the torpedo bay at the stern and then an open hatch above. Within 15 minutes the 1,300-ton submarine, which had served the Navy for 25 years, had sunk to the bottom of the dock. Three crew members trapped inside, although they escaped 12 hours later. However, the submarine was irreparably damaged. Many of her senior officers, including her  commander, were not aboard at the time - and Artemis was under the control of her third hand. Following the calamity, a damning report was compiled laying blame firmly on the crew for negligence. Saved: Acting Leading Marine Engineering Mechanic Donald Patrick Beckett was one of three men trapped inside the forward torpedo room of Artemis when she sank  in Gosport in July 1971 . Getting out: Beckett was the second man to escape from the sunken Artemis. A frogman is pictured (right) diving in to pull him to safety . Out of the water: A frogman with Beckett, one of the three escaped trapped sailors at the scene in 1971 . Aid: Leading Marine Engineering Mechanic Robert Croxon is helped to an ambulance after escaping . The embarrassing story has come to light after a former crewman took an engine telegraph he salvaged from the wreck along to the BBC programme Antiques Roadshow. HMS Artemis was an A-class submarine, built by Scotts Shipbuilding & Engineering Company of Greenock on the River Clyde. It was launched just after the end of the Second World War in August 1946, before taking part in the Fleet Review seven years later for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation. She weighed 1,360 tons and was 280ft long, with a beam of 22ft and a depth of 16ft. It had a diving depth limit of 350ft, a surface speed of 18.5 knots and a crew of 61. Artemis sank in July 1971 while while moored at the HMS Dolphin shore-establishment at a wet dock Gosport, Hampshire, during refuelling. She had been there for maintenance, but water began to come in through the open hatchways when she was ballasted down, and she sank. The submarine was raised five days after sinking before being decommissioned, and sold to be broken up for scrap that December. A report called 'HMS Artemis - The Lessons Learnt' was produced following the incident - and it is still said to be essential reading for submarine commanders even today. Over its 22 pages, there are 65 errors of judgement. Peter Taylor, an engine room stoker who was 22 at the time, bought the device upon seeing the wrecked sub about to be dismantled at a scrap yard in Portsmouth in 1993. The machine, used to send messages from the bridge to the engine room, still has watermarks on it from where it was flooded. Mr Taylor, 65, from Portsmouth, said: ‘Artemis had just undergone its last ever refit at the dry dock in Gosport, which I had worked on. ‘Following the refit I took leave to my home in Staffordshire and was in the pub when the landlord’s son came over and said my submarine had just sunk. ‘He had just seen it on TV so I got straight onto my motorbike and rode home to see the news. ‘As the sub’s fuel tanks were being flooded with sea water, which is done on subs for ballast purposes, water started coming in through the torpedo bay which had been left open. ‘As the torpedo bay filled up the stern of the sub sank down until water started coming in through the rear escape hatch, which had power cables running through it into the control room. ‘The hatch couldn’t be shut because of . the cables and within 15 minutes the whole thing was at the bottom of . the harbour. Basically the crew on the submarine that day were not doing . their jobs properly. ‘The whole affair was a PR disaster for . the Navy, especially because it happened at the Submarine Service . headquarters, and not something they like talking about even to this . day.

Photograph: An image from the sinking in July 1971 is shown to the expert on the Antiques Roadshow . ‘It was an embarrassment that should never have happened. In 1993 I noticed Artemis was being cut up and so I went along to see if there was anything left that I could have as a souvenir. ‘The only thing left was the port engine telegraph which I bought for £30.’ 'The whole affair was a PR disaster for the Navy, especially because it happened at the Submarine Service headquarters, and not something they like talking about even to this day' Peter Taylor, former engine room stoker . The engineering officer, the third hand and the chief stoker were all found at a court martial to have been guilty of making mistakes that caused the submarine to sink. George Malcolmson, historian at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Gosport, said: ‘The sinking of Artemis was not the Submarine Service’s finest hour - it was all very embarrassing. ‘It was a watershed moment for the service and had far reaching consequences which are still being felt today. ‘The Navy’s first nuclear submarines had . been introduced to some controversy not long before, and here was a . group of seamen who couldn’t keep their submarine afloat when docked at . the service’s HQ.

Following the sinking the Navy came down hard and a document was produced warning of the danger of complacency. 'It was a watershed moment for the service and had far reaching consequences which are still being felt today' George Malcolmson, historian . 'It is still used today, and thankfully the incident has never been repeated.’ Paul Atterbury, the Antiques Roadshow specialist, tells Mr Taylor on the show: ‘I think it’s a great story because it’s the sort of story that never gets told because it’s about bungled - you know it’s not the great heroics that we’d all expect. But you’ve got this great treasure and it is a very important piece.’ Mr Taylor’s telegraph machine from HMS Artemis will feature on the Antiques Roadshow on Sunday.","HMS Artemis was about to be refuelled at Gosport wet dock in July 1971 .

The 337-page report, explaining the reasoning for Knox's reconviction, was issued by an appeals court in Florence, Italy, on Tuesday. It accuses Knox of delivering the fatal knife blow to the 21-year-old in 2007 out of a desire to 'overpower and humiliate' her victim. Scroll down for video . Support: Judge Claudio Hellmann (left) has condemned a report stating that Amanda Knox (right) murdered British student Meredith Kercher - claiming it is more like a 'script for a movie or thriller book' than evidence . It also claims that the 26-year-old fought with Ms Kercher over rent money on the night of the murder - while her relationship with her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, was 'not idyllic'. But now, Judge Claudio Hellmann, who threw out the murder convictions against Knox in 2011, has dismissed the document as a 'result of fantasy'. The judge, who has now retired, told CNN: 'The Florence Appeal Court has written a script for a movie or a thriller book while it should have only considered facts and evidence.' He said there was no evidence to condemn Knox and Sollecito, who were convicted of Ms Kercher's murder in 2009 and sentenced to 28 and 25 years in prison respectively.

Ms Kercher, from . Coulsdon in Surrey, was found dead with her throat slashed in the . bedroom of her home she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, on November . 2, 2007.

However, they were reconvicted by the Florence appeals court on January 30, and sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively . According to the report, known as a 'motivation' of the sentence, Knox inflicted the fatal knife wound to Ms Kercher, a student at Leeds University. The document states: 'It . is a matter of fact that at a certain point in the evening events . accelerated; the English girl was attacked by Amanda Marie Knox, by . Raffaele Sollecito, who was backing up his girlfriend, and by Rudy . Hermann Guede, and constrained within her own room.' Jailed: Rudy Hermann Guede is currently serving a 16-year sentence for the murder of Ms Kercher . It adds that is difficult to establish a reason for the brutal slaying . of Ms Kercher, but goes on to cite allegations of tension between Knox and the student. It also refers to a statement that Guede made to police that Ms Kercher believed . Knox stole 300 euros (£246) - and two credits cards - from her, . which is described as a ‘valid motive’ for the murder. On Tuesday, Knox claimed the report's reasons for reinstating the conviction against her were unsupported by evidence or logic. In a written statement, she said: 'The recent Motivation document does not - . and cannot - change the forensic evidence: Experts agreed that my DNA . was not found anywhere in Meredith’s room, while the DNA of the actual . murderer, Rudy Guede, was found throughout that room and on Meredith’s . body. 'This forensic evidence directly refutes the . multiple-assailant theory found in the new Motivation document. This . theory is not supported by any reliable forensic evidence. I am innocent'. She added that she is now focusing on 'pursuing an appeal' to Italy's Supreme Court.

After two years apart, Cila the brown Labrador Retriever leaped into his former handler's arms at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport yesterday, as an elated Bos repeatedly yelled, 'Cici! Hi baby!' 'She looked at me, she started smelling me, she knew me,' Bos told Chicago Tribune. 'They tell you not to get too attached, that they’re not a pet, they’re a tool to help keep people safe. But it’s hard.' Scroll down for video . Heartwarming: Sergeant Jason Bos has been reunited with explosive detection dog, Cila, at O¿Hare International Airport yesterday . Loving relationship: Cila leaped into the arms of Bos, her old partner, at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport yesterday and rolled on her back so Bos could rub her belly . Special bond: Even when he was off-duty, Bos would spend time playing with his war pooch Cila at her kennel, sealing their unique bond . Happy home: Bos said his new housemate, Cila the Labrador, will sleep on his couch . When the duo were paired in 2008, their connection was instant and only got stronger over the course of their five-year partnership. 'No one could work with this dog, and yet, she listened to me,' Bos told Fox 32. 'I don't know why she listened to me. Maybe it's my inflection, maybe it's my personality.' Bos and Cila M389 searched for roadside bombs and hidden weapons caches during more than 100 missions in Iraq, and screened sites for presidential visits across the U.S. On base, Bos often spent his off-duty time playing with Cila at the kennel. But they were separated in 2012 when Bos was forced to retire with a back injury. While the 33-year-old headed home to Michigan, the canine returned to active duty. 'It was tough. I was a little emotional about it because I didn't know if I was going to see her again,' Bos said. Forging a bond: For nearly five years, Bos and Cila the military working dog searched for roadside bombs and hidden weapons caches in Iraq, and screened sites for presidential visits across the U.S. Battle buddies: Bos' partnership with Cila ended when a back injury forced Bos to leave the Army in 2012, but their bond was never broken . Bond: Army Sgt. Jason Bos said it was impossible not to get attached to his war dog buddy Cila over their five-year partnership . Heartbroken Bos never expected to see his former war time buddy again - until a month ago when he saw on Facebook that Cila was due to be retired. The kennel master at his former base contacted Bos to see if he wanted to adopt her. Bos . reached out to the American Humane Association and Mission K9 Rescue . for help with the cost of flying Cila from Germany to Chicago. 'A lot of these dogs aren't able to go back to their handler, and I'm one of the lucky ones,' Bos told Fox 32. Yesterday, after a nine hour flight, Cila stepped out of a travel carrier and into the arms of a very excited and emotional Bos.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A medical director at a Reading, Massachusetts, fertility clinic has been accused of molesting his patients while they were under anesthetic, for at least a decade. A total of 18 witnesses, including nurses, surgical technicians, colleagues, and other fertility physicians at the Fertility Centers of New England said they saw Dr Roger Ian Hardy rub patients' genitals, attempt to stimulate them while sedated using a hose and touch their breasts. The doctor received his first complaint from a patient in 2004, according to records of a state investigation but the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine closed the case without taking action against Hardy. Accused molester: Dr Roger Hardy, pictured, a medical director at a Reading, Massachusetts, fertility clinic, has been accused of molesting his patients while they were under anesthetic, for at least a decade . The 55-year-old was able to continue practicing despite employees reporting at least three other incidents of alleged molestation over the years. According to the Boston Globe, which obtained the documents, it was only this year that the 20-year veteran of reproductive endocrinology resigned his medical license after new allegations were made to the medical board, sparking an investigation. On January 21, Hardy stepped down. The redacted records do not shed any light on why Hardy's alleged behavior was allowed to continue for so long. Hardy denied the claims to a board investigator before his resignation, suggesting they might be a competitor attempting to frame him for their own benefit, according to the records. It's not known who the latest allegations came from. But it was a patient who first complained in 2004 about the physician, writing the board in a 2004 letter, 'I was afraid ... that something criminal had been done to me.' According to the Globe, the alleged victim described suffering trauma to her genitals during a procedure Hardy performed in December 2003 at the Hunt Center in Danvers, then part of Beverly Hospital. She said she was sedated at the time. Hardy vehemently denied the accusation at the time, insisting three 'professional assistants' were present in the operating room. Fertility clinic: The alleged abuse took place at the Reading location, pictured, of the Fertility Centers of New England . The Department of Public Health, which licenses the fertility clinic, has confirmed it too is conducting 'an ongoing investigation' into the alleged molestations. One fertility physician at the clinic told board investigators that nurses were afraid to speak out for fear of losing their jobs after. The Globe cites an investigatorâ€™s affidavit as saying that a nurse and a technician who reported one incident to a superior were told not to talk about it. But records show one nurse ignored this advice and filed an anonymous report with the board. However it was only until last October, when one physician filed a formal complaint with the medical board, that an investigation was launched. That doctor said she was 'horrified' after a longtime patient revealed to her that Hardy had touched her sexually and rubbed her genitals, telling her it was a routine part of the examination and her fertility treatment. The patient, in her 40s, said the alleged molestation took place during several unchaperoned appointments in 2011. The patient later came forward to the board. Hardy, a University of Cincinnati College of Medicine graduate, was also licensed in Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, and California. Maine and New Hampshire authorities have suspended his license. His attorney, Martin Foster of Cambridge, did not return the Globe's calls seeking comment.","Dr Roger Ian Hardy allegedly rubbed patients' genitals, attempted to .

"By . Ashley Collman . Parents in Missouri City, Texas are calling for a school bus driver to be sacked after the woman abandoned their children and threw the keys at one of the students, saying: 'How about you drive the bus home'. The driver has not officially been identified, but one mother told MailOnline that the kids called her Ms Sylvia. On Thursday, the Fort Bend Independent School District said it is investigating the incident which happened Tuesday while Ms Sylvia was taking home Baines Middle School students. Stormed out: A Texas bus driver may be fired after abandoning middle school students when she became upset over how loud they were being Tuesday afternoon. She was photographed by one of the students outside the bus where she waited an hour for a replacement driver . 'How about you drive the bus home': Baines Middle School student Morgan Billingsley says the driver threw the keys at her when she asked where she was going . School district officials say the driver 'got upset' with the 12 students on board, who were apparently being loud. Student Morgan Billingsley was on the bus at the time and told KTRK that Ms Sylvia pulled the bus over on a busy bridge and started packing her purse. After Morgan asked what she was doing, Ms Sylvia threw the keys at her and said, 'How about you drive the bus home'. The shocked student took a picture holding the keys and of Ms Sylvia standing outside the bus, where she waited an hour for a replacement driver. Evidence: After the driver stormed off the bus, Morgan took pictures of her waiting outside and the keys that she was given. Many of the parents were forced to pick their kids up at the parked bus when it took a replacement driver an hour to get there . Morgan's mother Reshonda Tate Billingsley told MailOnline that some parents ended up picking their children up from the parked bus, which was on the main road that leads into a very populated residential community. And this isn't the first time the kids have had a run-in with Ms Sylvia. A few months ago parents wrote letters complaining about the white driver after she allegedly called the black kids on the bus n*****s, Ms Billingsley said. The incident happened when some of the kids on the bus started singing a song called 'Shrimp Fried Rice' which they found on YouTube. The driver got angry, parked the bus and had all of the non-black kids get off the bus, Ms Billingsley was told by her daughter. Frustrated: Morgan's mother Reshonda Tate Billingsley and other parents are calling for the driver to be fired. Allegedly the driver had also called the black children on the bus the n-word before . She then allegedly told the students: 'You shouldn't sing that song. That song is racist. You guys are all n*****s and how would you like it if I called you a n*****.' Ms Billingsley says her daughter and the other children were shocked. While Ms Billingsley and other parents complained about that incident, she says there have been near daily problems and that many of the students were afraid of the woman who was 'yelling and erratic all of the time'. 'We blew it off for the longest time because we just thought they were kids complaining,' she said. 'We know that woman's job is hard. We blew them off, but everyday it was something new.' But Tuesday's incident was the final straw for the parents who are now calling for Ms Sylvia to be fired. 'To say I'm appalled is an understatement. It is one thing to be frustrated by kids. I completely get that, but you are in a position where you are supposed to be trained to deal with unruly noisy children. She does not need to be working with children,' Ms Billingsly told KPRC. The school district says Ms Sylvia wasn't fired after the n-word incident, but that they will take that into account when deciding what to do about her actions Tuesday. Ms Sylvia has not yet been fired, but has been suspended from driving buses pending the investigation. School district officials issued a statement Thursday saying they regret what happened and will take the appropriate action.","The driver, identified by one mother as 'Ms Sylvia', walked off her bus Tuesday in Missouri City, Texas .

"By . Joshua Gardner . Even inside the United States, a nation well-known for its comparatively lavish tipping practices, not everyone can agree on how much gratuity to give food service professionals. State-by-state, Americans vary wildly on how much they choose to give and to whom. Using data from smartphone credit card payment company Square, Quartz put together some visuals that expertly tell tale of American gratuity from sea to shining sea. Gratuity: An analysis by Quartz of data from mobile credit card payment company Square showed just where people do, and don't, tip. In front for largest tips at sit-down type restaurants was West Virginia and at the top of the pack for residents who tip most often was Illinois . By looking at many millions of credit card transactions at coffee shops, restaurants and food trucks, the data also pieces together where exactly a state's residents are more or less likely to leave a tip. For restaurants, a category that appears to mean mostly sit-down eateries, the nation's top tippers can be found in the state of West Virginia. In the Mountain State, patrons paying with Square leave an average gratuity of about 20.1 percent of the bill. That's 3.6 percent higher than the 16.6 percent average tip left by diners across America. The lowest-tipping state at restaurants was found to be Nevada, which clocked in with an average tip of 14.6 percent. Worlds apart: The smallest tips across all eatery types were found in Delaware and the largest in Alaska . For coffee shops servers, Square's data show that people tip the most overall with an average of over 18 percent. South Carolina is the kindest to those who make their cappuccinos where Palmetto State patrons give an average 23 percent tip. Meanwhile, working the espresso bar in Hawaii means saying aloha to your tips. Residents there tip baristas on average 15 percent. The last establishment category analyzed by Quartz was food trucks or carts. These tended to be the worst of the three for tips and the worst of the worst was Georgia, where truck employees can expect tips of 15 percent. The best place to sling slop from the side of a vehicle is Iowa, where employees average 25 percent tips. Across the states, the people who tip most often (as opposed to the largest) are in Illinois, with the Delaware residents appeared to tip the least often. Who's to blame: Quartz also gave a state-by-state look at which states are nicest to their servers .","West Virginians tip restaurant workers the most according to data from mobile credit card company Square, while Nevadans tipped the worst .

"By . Associated Press . A construction worker was held without bond today over the murder of a Brooklyn real estate developer who was abducted as he left his office during a snowstorm and whose body was found dumped in a trash can. Kendel Felix was arrested for the murder of Menachem Stark, a father-of-seven and prominent member of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish sect who owned and renovated several buildings in Brooklyn, New York, but owed millions of dollars. Felix, 26, from Crown Heights, said nothing during his arraignment which lasted around a minute. He did not enter a plea at Brooklyn Criminal Court. Kendel Felix (pictured left in court today) is arraigned for the murder of Menacham Stark in Brooklyn Criminal Court . Menachem Stark, a father-of-seven and prominent member of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish sect, was murdered and his body burned in January . A police spokesman did not give a motive for the slaying, nor did he say if there were any other suspects in custody. Surveillance footage shows Stark being strong-armed into a minivan the night of January 2. One . of his brothers-in-law contacted the Hasidic community's volunteer . neighborhood patrol, the shomrim, when he didn't return home. When the patrol members found his car and his office locked, they checked surveillance camera footage and then called police. His burned body turned up a day later in a smoldering trash bin in suburban Long Island. Stark, . 39, has been described as an honest family man eager to help his . neighbors and friends, a man who had no enemies. But he's also been . called a slumlord. Some of his buildings were in disrepair, and he owed . millions of dollars to creditors and had declared bankruptcy in 2009.

"By . Associated Press . The Education Department on Thursday took the unprecedented step of releasing the names of the 55 colleges and universities currently facing a Title IX investigation over their handling of sexual abuse complaints. The release came two days after a White House task force promised greater government transparency on sexual assault in higher education. Going forward, the department said, it will keep an updated list of schools facing such an investigation and make it available upon request. The schools range from big public universities like Ohio State University, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Arizona State University to private schools like Knox College in Illinois, Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania and Catholic University of America in the District of Columbia. Ivy League schools like Harvard, Princeton and Dartmouth are also on the list. Scroll down for the entire list of schools being investigated . Harvard is one of the Ivy League schools named on a list of colleges facing a federal sexual assault probe . The agency previously would confirm such an investigation when asked, but students and others were often unaware of them. 'We hope this increased transparency will spur community dialogue about this important issue,' Catherine E. Lhamon, the department's assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement. Lhamon said a school's appearance on the list does not mean that it has violated the law but that an investigation is ongoing. Title IX prohibits gender discrimination at schools that receive federal funds. It is the same law that guarantees girls equal access to sports, but it also regulates institutions' handling of sexual violence and increasingly is being used by victims who say their schools failed to protect them. Ada Meloy, general counsel for the American Council on Education, a higher education group, said most of the schools were probably aware there was such an investigation. 'I think that every college and university in the current environment is concerned about the need to be very attentive to what they are doing with regard to policies and procedures' related to sexual assault on campuses, Meloy said. •Arizona State University                             •Butte-Glen Community College District•Occidental College                                    •University of California-Berkeley•University of Southern California               •Regis University•University of Colorado at Boulder                  •University of Colorado at Denver•University of Denver                                  •University of Connecticut•Catholic University of America                   •Florida State University•Emory University                                        •University of Hawaii at Manoa•University of Idaho                                     •Knox College•University of Chicago                                            •Indiana University-Bloomington•Vincennes University                                  •Amherst College•Boston University                                       •Emerson College•Harvard College                                         •Harvard University - Law School•University of Massachusetts-Amherst        •Frostberg State University•Michigan State University                           •University of Michigan-Ann Arbor•Guilford College                                         •University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill•Minot State University                                 •Dartmouth College•Princeton University                                   •Cuny Hunter College•Hobar and William Smith Colleges              •Sarah Lawrence College•Suny at Binghamton                                   •Denison University•Ohio State University                                  •Wittenberg University•Oklahoma State University                          •Carnegie Mellon University•Franklin and Marshall College                    •Pennsylvania State University•Swarthmore College                                   •Temple University•Vanderbilt University                                   •Southern Methodist University•The University of Texas Pan-American       •College of William and Mary•University of Virginia                                   •Washington State University•University of Wisconsin-Whitewater            •Bethany College•West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine . Citing research, the White House has said . that 1 in 5 female students is assaulted. President  Obama appointed a . task force comprised of his Cabinet members to review the issue after . hearing complaints about the poor treatment of campus rape victims and . the hidden nature of such crimes. The task force announced the creation of a website, notalone.gov, offering resources for victims and information about past enforcement actions on campuses. The task force also made a wide range of recommendations to schools, such as identifying confidential victims' advocates and conducting surveys to better gauge the frequency of sexual assault on their campuses. The department publicized guidance on Title IX's sexual assault provisions in 2011, and complaints by students have since increased. Complaints, however, don't always lead to an investigation. The department can withhold federal funding from a school that doesn't comply with the law, but it so far has not used that power and instead has negotiated voluntary resolutions for violators. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., have said non-compliance under the law is 'far too common'. They say a lack of federal resources is partly to blame for that, and they've sought more money to ensure timely and proper investigations. Another law that campus sexual assault cases fall under is the Clery Act, which requires colleges and universities to report crime statistics on or near their campuses. It also requires schools to develop prevention policies and ensure victims their basic rights. Investigations under this law are not included in the list that was released.","Big public universities like Ohio State University, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Arizona State University also being investigated .

"By . Reuters . and Daily Mail Reporter . A deep-ocean exploration company is seeking to recover a lucrative haul of gold aboard the shipwreck of the SS Central America, nearly 160 years after it sank off the coast of South Carolina in a hurricane. The work that began this week follows a long court battle over treasure salvaged from the shipwreck in the late 1980s by a pioneering young engineer whose efforts were detailed in the 1998 bestselling book, Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea. The 85-metre-long sidewheel steamship carried as much as 19 tonnes of gold ingots, freshly minted gold coins and raw gold from the California mines, as well as the personal wealth and belongings of its 477 passengers, most of whom were lost when the ship sank in September 1857. Watery grave: The SS Central America sunk in 1857, drowning 425 of its 477 passengers and crew and taking with it a fortune in gold . The ship's gold that is thought to remain on the ocean floor was valued at $760,000 US in 1857 but worth millions of dollars today, according to Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc, a Florida-based company which won the contract to revisit the shipwreck. 'There's no doubt in our minds that there's going to be an economic return,' Mark Gordon, the company's president and chief operating officer, said on Monday. Fugitive: Tommy Thompson, now 62, retrieved $52 million worth of gold from the wreck before going on the lam, stiffing his investors of their cut . Gold recovered from the ship by a team led by Ohio engineer Tommy Thompson, which discovered the Central America using sonar and robotic technology he developed, became the focus of an extended legal fight over rights to the treasure and return for investors. Thompson has been a fugitive since 2012 when he failed to appear in court. Last year, a court in Ohio appointed a receiver who will distribute some of the profits from further exploration to the former investors. In March, the receiver awarded Odyssey the contract to revisit the shipwreck, which lies over 257 kilometres offshore and about 2.2 kilometers below the surface. 'We know that the wreck was only partially excavated, only about five per cent of the site,' Gordon said. The . company's research vessel, Odyssey Explorer, sailed from Charleston, . South Carolina, last week with 41 crew members for a project he . estimated will cost between $5 and $10 million. The . Central America steamship ran between Panama and New York, carrying . prospectors and their fortunes made in the California Gold Rush. On its . last trip, it held tons of commercial gold valued at about $93,000 in . 1857 and passenger gold valued at up to $1.2 million, court experts . estimated. Historians . say the ship's sinking triggered a New York banking panic that was part . of a larger U.S. financial crisis known as the Panic of 1857. Remaining riches: An Ohio judge approved a deal to recover the remaining gold from a ship that sank off the Carolina coast . The Odyssey Explorer: Odyssey Marine Exploration is set to begin a new search for the SS Central America off the South Carolina coast . The worth of the gold found by the Odyssey team will depend on what form they find it in, Gordon said. For example, U.S. $20 Double Eagle gold coins fetch $5,000 apiece on average from collectors, he said. The market price for pure gold bullion on Wednesday was around $1,300 per troy ounce. Bob Evans, of Recovery Limited Partnership, the court-appointed receiver that hired Odyssey, told Bloomberg there may be up to $86 million of gold still lying on the ship. Researchers will remain on site for up to five months, rotating crew around the clock and making occasional port calls on Charleston, South Carolina, Gordon said. The company expects to report in about 60 days what the wreck might yield.","The SS Central America sunk off the coast of South Carolina in a hurricane in 1857 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Razor blades planted in the grass at a San Diego playground have injured two brothers who played barefoot, sparking fears of copycat pranks. Cassie Padilla called police when her seven-year-old son Tristen stepped on a blade and her 15-year-old son Daniel was grazed by another, at Bonita Cove Park on Mariners Way about 7pm last night. As paramedics pulled the razor out of Tristen's foot, police officers scoured the park with metal detectors and found 19 blades sticking out of the grass - many around a picnic table and bench. San Diego Police Department Lt. Paul Phillips said officers are hunting the 'sick' vandals who deliberately planted the blades, in what is becoming an increasingly common prank. 'The first thing that would come to mind is sickness and frustration,' Lt. Phillips told CBS News 8. 'Can you imagine with children around here? This is not a prank this is a sickness or someone who has an evil mind.' Scroll down for video . Furious: Cassie Padilla (right) called police when her two sons, 15-year-old Daniel (center) and seven-year-old Tristen (left), stepped on razor blades deliberately planted in the grass at San Diego's Bonita Cove Park last night . Ouch! Seven-year-old Tristen (pictured) needed stitches after stepping on a sharp razor blade buried in the grass at San Diego's Bonita Cove Park . Injured: Paramedics pulled out the blade that was embedded in Tristen's foot and bandaged him up before the boy's mom took him to hospital for stitches . Dangerous: Vandals had planted at least 19 sharp razor blades in the grass around the playground and picnic bench at Bonita Cove Park in San Diego (pictured) The Padilla family were enjoying a picnic with relatives at the park last night when the boys were injured. 'It's pretty crazy. His (Tristen's razor blade) was probably sticking up. It's really bad,' mom-of-two Cassie Padilla told ABC 10 News. She said after Tristen's accident, her older son Daniel stepped on a blade but the nick wasn't serious. Paramedics bandaged Danie's foot at the scene before his mother took him to UCSD Medical Center for stitches. 'I think that's crazy that anyone would do that,' Cassie Padilla said. Lt. Phillips said police will analyze the razor blades to find any evidence and vowed to catch copycats. Search: Police swept San Diego's Bonita Cove Park with metal detectors last night and found 19 razor blades hidden in the grass . Collecting evidence: Police meticulously scoured Bonita Cove Park for razor blades pushed in the grass, placing markers at the spots where they were found . CBS News 8 reported police were . called to Bonita Cove Park three times last year to find razor blades . purposely planted in the grass, the playground and sandbox. According to UT San Diego, a woman cut her foot on a razor blade while walking through grass near one of the playgrounds last August. Eight blades were found in the area. Several . weeks later, about 20 razor blades were found in a park area across the . street from the first location, but no one was injured. Scene: Most of the blades were planted around this table at Bonita Cove Park, where the Padilla family were enjoying a picnic . Copycat offense: Police were called to San Diego's Bonita Cove Park at least three times last year following reports vandals had left razor blades near the playground, sand box and in the grass . Reports of vandals planting blades around playgrounds and parks across America have become increasingly common, with authorities urging families to keep a close eye on where their children are playing. In Illinois last month, a two-year-old boy cut himself on blades which vandals had glued to the playground monkey bars, slide and ground. Authorities found a dozen blades stuck to the equipment with a putty-like adhesive. Earlier this month, razor blades were found duct-taped to playground equipment at Eaton Park, outside Philadelphia.

"By . Emma Glanfield . and Chris Pleasance . and Associated  Press Reporter . Investigators are trying to positively identify a . body discovered burned beyond recognition last week in a charred Range Rover . near a luxury hotel on the north shore of this Caribbean island. Officials . released scant details at a news conference, but speculation was rife . that the dead man was wealthy hotelier Oliver Gobat, a St. Lucia native . who also has British citizenship. He was reported missing Friday, the same day the body was found near his family's upscale Cap Maison hotel and spa. Inferno: Police forensic officers examine the shell of the car in which it is believed that hotelier Oliver 'Ollie' Gobat's charred remains were found in St Lucia . Multimillionaire Oliver Gobat, 38, was allegedly shot twice in the head before being doused with petrol and set alight in his Range Rover, pictured, on the Caribbean Island of St Lucia . Tourism . Minister Lorne Theophilus said only that the body was believed to be a 'prominent St. Lucian resident associated with the tourism sector.' On Wednesday, Gobat's family issued a . statement saying they were devastated by his 'sudden and tragic death.' They said he died Friday and they planned to hold a memorial service . Saturday. However, Assistant Police Commissioner Frances . Henry said officials were still trying to determine the identity and . were working on getting forensic assistance from overseas. A police statement Tuesday said the body's identity could not be conclusively determined 'in the absence of scientific evidence.' An . initial autopsy found evidence of head trauma and possible gunshot . wounds, according to police. But they said the body was so badly burned . it  would require further work to determine the cause of death. A charred body was found in a burnt-out car on the Cap Estate, an exclusive resort area on the island, hours after Gboat's family, who run a five-star boutique hotel on the island, reported him missing. Reports suggested the victim had been shot twice in the head before being doused with gasoline and set alight. British hotelier Oliver Gobat (pictured left with his sister-in-law Alexandra See), was allegedly found in a burnt-out Range Rover on the island of St Lucia . The family have confirmed there will be a memorial service for the hotelier in Caribbean and UK . In a statement, his family said: . 'The Gobat family are devastated by the sudden and tragic death of . their son and brother Oliver on Friday April 25 in St Lucia, the island . where he was born and which he loved. 'We . have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of messages and love but we do . need to grieve and we would ask for privacy at this time. 'There . will be a celebration of the life of Oliver Gobat held in St Lucia for . family and friends this Saturday, May 3, from 5pm and a memorial will . be held in the UK in the near future with dates and details to follow.' Though Mr Gobat was born in St Lucia, he held joint British and Caribbean nationality. After Mr Gobat's death, double Olympic decathlon champion Daley Thompson tweeted his condolences. He . said: 'My love and thoughts go out to friends and family of Ollie . Gobat. He was a gem and his family must have been so proud of him. RIP . my friend. X' BBC sports pundit and Olympic heptathlon gold medallist Denise Lewis also tweeted her condolences. She . said: 'Just read the shocking news about the death of Oliver Gobat. So . very sad. My condolences to his friends and family. Such a lovely guy.' On Tuesday, horrific pictures emerged showing the burnt-out wreckage of a Range Rover in which local police officers found a body, thought to be that of Mr Gobat. The charred remains were discovered hours . after his family - who run a $685-a-night five star boutique hotel - . reported him missing. The 38-year-old's death remains a mystery as police have been unable to give details until a post mortem examination is complete . The burned wreckage of the Range Rover, believed to be owned by British millionaire Oliver 'Ollie' Gobat, was found on a remote pathway in St Lucia with the wealthy hotelier's body inside . One of the rooms at Cap Maison - the hotel run by the Gobat family. Rooms cost up to £400 per night . The athlete tweeted this heart-felt message to Mr Gobat's family . Olympian Daley Thompson, who has carried out fitness workshops at the Gobat family’s luxurious Cap Maison hotel on the island, paid tribute to the hotelier on Twitter. He . wrote: 'My love&thoughts go out to friends&family of Ollie . Gobat. he was a gem& his family must have been so proud of him. RIP . my friend. X’ Unconfirmed . reports from St Lucia suggest Mr Gobat’s family lodged a ‘missing . person’ report with police after he failed to return home on Friday . night. Athlete Daley Thompson who knew the Gobat family today tweeted: 'My love&thoughts go out to friends&family of Ollie Gobat. he was a gem& his family must have been so proud of him. RIP my friend. X . The vehicle he owns matches the description of the Range Rover which was discovered with the body inside around 9pm last Friday. The . body of the prominent island businessman, in his late thirties, was . said to have been ‘burnt beyond recognition’ and was found in the front . passenger seat. The FCO is working with island authorities to help identify the body after news emerged of the death. An FCO spokesperson said: 'We are aware of reports and are looking into them urgently.' A spokesman for St Lucia police said: 'We can’t disclose any information at the moment, we are meeting with the family soon.' Cap . Maison, a five-star boutique hotel set in the lush tropical grounds of a . former sugar plantation on the northern tip of the island, offers . luxury suites. Guests, which have included Amy Winehouse and Kelly Brook, stay in colonial-style villas and every luxury is on tap, including valets, private chefs, a walk-in wine cellar and spa. The creators of the hotel were the Gobat family, Theo and Helen and their three sons Rufus, Adam and Oliver. The dead man’s parents, who live in Esher, Surrey, are understood to have flown out to St Lucia. Theo Gobat, 74, was born in Chester and trained as an accountant and moved to St Lucia in 1974 as finance director of a hotel and travel company which then went bankrupt. He and another director successfully took over the company’s hotels and eventually created the small, upmarket Cap Maison. Oliver was born in St Lucia but had dual . nationality. He represented Surrey juniors at cricket and attended Leeds . University, before moving to Australia to help launch a health and . fitness club in Adelaide, Australia. Mr Garner's death comes three after Roger Pratt, 62, was murdered and his wife Margaret, 60, injured when robbers attacked their yacht as it lay moored off the Caribbean island of St Lucia. The couple, from Warwickshire, had been on a dream voyage around the world on their £200,000 yacht, when they were ambushed at the port of Vieux Fort, at night. Four men have been charged with Mr Pratt's murder. Paradise: Cap Maison estate of luxury apartments and hotel in the Caribbean run by Mr Gobat .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Jessica Jerreat . Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice arrived Thursday morning to court holding wife Jenay Palmer's hand and pleaded not guilty to assaulting her earlier this year in an Atlantic City casino. Rice was captured in February on security camera footage dragging his then-fiancÃ©e Janay Palmer's body into an elevator. They have since married despite the Super Bowl champion being charged with third-degree aggravated assault. He was indicted the day before their wedding for knocking her unconscious. Scroll down for video . Facing the judge: Baltimore Ravens football player Ray Rice, second from left, and his attorney Michael Diamondstein stand during Rice's Thursday arraignment . A united front: Baltimore Ravens football player Ray Rice holds hands with his wife Janay Palmer as they arrive Thursday at the Atlantic County Criminal Courthouse in Mays Landing . The not guilty plea came despite prosecutors offering Rice a plea deal that would not involve him serving jail time, the Baltimore Sun reported. First time offenders in New Jersey are also permitted to enter a diversionary program that would allow him to avoid further court appearances and keep his record clean, the Rutgers alum's lawyers told the paper. Rice spent hours filling out the paperwork to enter the program despite not yet being given the green light by prosecutors, the paper said. Authorities' blessing is needed to go that route. He was offered probation an court mandated anger management in his plea deal, and prosecutors did not signal to the paper whether they would allow him to take part in the diversionary program. 'There are guidelines which suggest a crime of violence may be rejected if the prosecutors doesn't consent to the application,' an official said, adding that the offer already made is 'consistent with other plea offers in similar cases.' Rice's attorney's plan to appeal if he is not allowed into the program. Seeking help: An attorney for Rice says the footballer and his new wife are happy and having counseling . The not guilty plea comes only one month after the controversial couple was married. They had been planning the . wedding for a couple of weeks, according to TMZ, but news of the . ceremony drew criticism from fellow American footballers. Buffalo Bills linebacker Brandon . Spikes claimed on Twitter the wedding was an attempt by Rice 'to save his image'. The . 27-year-old was arrested over allegations of domestic violence on . February 15 after an incident at the Revel Casino and Hotel in New . Jersey. If found guilty he could be sentenced to three to five years in prison. Rice's attorney, Michael . Diamondstein, described footage of his client dragging Palmer as . 'authentic but incomplete'. 'We . deny that he committed an aggravated assault. We don't think the law . would support that [he did]. And we just ask the public to reserve . judgment until all of the facts are out,' Diamondstein told ESPN. He added that the couple, who have a young daughter together, were 'happy and in counseling'. Backing: The Baltimore Ravens have defended Rice, seen here with Janay, and says he will remain on the team . Rice's . team has also released a statement backing their player, which read: . 'We know there is more to Ray Rice than this one incident.' Team . owner Steve Bisciotti added that Rice, who in 2012 signed a five-year . $35 million contract with the Ravens, will continue to have a future . there. The indictment, first reported by the Press of Atlantic City, came after the couple both declined medical treatment at the Revel but security video made the allegations hard to look past.

"By . Ben Spencer . Growing pollution from traffic fumes mean people with breathing problems should live at least 1,000 feet from a busy road, scientists warn today. The advice, which is almost impossible to implement in all but the most rural of areas, is a startling warning of the health impact of air pollution. Scientists from the University of California said emissions from diesel engines were of particular concern for asthmatics, because it generates higher concentrations of harmful particles and nitrogen oxides. Asthmatics have been warned to move away from major roadways to help with their condition (picture posed by model) Their work comes just days after British scientists blamed the Government's support for diesel cars for creating a health crisis which kills 7,000 people a year. The new study, published in the Lancet today, reviews five years of research which found pollutants such as particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide can cause serious cell damage to airways, triggering asthma attacks. It concluded that the pollutants pumped into the air by diesel cars - including tiny particulates and black carbon particles - can trigger asthma attacks and are worst close to roads. The paper says: 'Patients with asthma should ideally live at least 300 metres (1,000 feet) away from major roadways, especially those with heavy truck traffic. 'Traffic-related air pollution can exacerbate asthma but concentrations of motor vehicle emissions such as ultrafine particulate matter and black carbon particles decrease substantially by 300 metres.' The authors, Professor Michael Guarnieri and Prof John Balmes, also advised motorists with asthma to drive with the windows closed. Scientists have claimed that the increased number of diesel cars on the road has led to an extra 7,000 deaths a year . They wrote: 'In vehicle exposure during commuting with open windows can also be very high.' Air pollution is particularly worrying for children, causing long-term problems if they are exposed to pollution early in life. The authors wrote: 'In a study of ten European cities, 14 per cent of the cases of incident asthma in children and 15 per cent of all exacerbations of childhood asthma were attributed to exposure to pollutants related to road traffic. 'Young children with asthma have long been regarded as a group who are very susceptible to adverse effects from air pollution because of their developing lungs, immature metabolic pathways, high ventilation rates per bodyweight, and increased time exercising outdoors.' One of Britain's top Government advisors this week said the Government had 'blindly' promoting diesel cars for decades. Professor Frank Kelly, chair of the Department of Health's committee on air pollution, said ministers had gone down the 'wrong route' by encouraging drivers to switch away from petrol. He said diesel engines - championed since the 1970s because they were thought to emit less greenhouse gases - could be responsible for more than 7,000 deaths a year in Britain. Half of the two million new cars bought each year in the UK are now diesel, up from just 14 per cent in 2000. There are nine million diesel cars on the road - more than at any time in history - and three million diesel vans. The UK is already facing Â£300million in European Commission fines for repeatedly failing to reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide air pollution. And the Government is to come under further pressure today, when the parliamentary environment watchdog announces a new inquiry into failed efforts to tackle air pollution. The House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee will examine what progress has been made to tackle poor air quality since it warned about the need for urgent action on pollution in a report in 2011. MP Joan Walley, who chairs the select committee, said: 'Air pollution is thought to contribute to more deaths than passive smoking, traffic accidents or obesity, yet the UK is still breaching European safety limits nearly five years after EU fines were first threatened. 'The Environmental Audit Committee warned four years ago that an urgent policy response, greater public awareness and a shift in transport policy was required if air quality was to be improved. 'We will be examining what progress has been made by central and local government since then in removing the most polluting vehicles from the road and encouraging cleaner forms of transport.'","Researchers found diesel engines are of particular concern to asthmatics .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Newly-released video has emerged of an admitted serial killer blaming his 2011 murder spree on the ‘kill gene.’ Former Marine Itzcoatl ‘Izzy’ Ocampo made the horrifying suggestion during questioning in early 2012 shortly after being arrested for the killing of six people in and around Anaheim, California. Many soldiers are said to have something called a ‘warrior gene,’ but Ocampo believed his genetics enabled him to kill six people – four homeless men, mother and her son. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . It was in his blood: Itzcoatl Ocampo admitted to killing six people and said he had a 'kill gene' that made him want to murder at least another 10 . The interrogation tape released by KTLA provides a glimpse into the mind of a man who told investigators he joined the Marines to learn how to kill so he could become a prolific serial killer, according to a transcript of his police interviews released by the Los Angeles Times. He intended to kill 16 people, authorities said. ‘Did you feel sexually aroused when you were doing this?’ He is asked by Anaheim police sergeant Daron Wyatt. ‘No, sir,’ says Ocampo. ‘How about afterwards?’ Wyatt asks. ‘Sexually aroused? No sir,’ Ocampo responds. “But . I felt weird… the f*****g kill gene like hit my sperm,’ he continues. ‘Like, that’s the way I feel right now, like my sperm have f*****g kill . in them. He wanted to be prolific: Ocampo had intentions to kill 16 people before his killing spree was stopped . ‘Like all right, you’re not a b***h anymore.’ When asked why he killed the homeless men, Ocampo says he was doing his duty. ‘Why did it have to be done, to satisfy your need?’ Wyatt asks. ‘No, not only did I make the county look bad or the state, they were making the place look bad also,’ Ocampo answers. ‘So really what you were doing is you were helping clean up the county, clean up the area?’ Wyatt responds. ‘In a way, sir, yes,’ says Ocampo. Ocampo also admits to knowing the difference between right and wrong, but says the murders were wrong but ‘had to be done.’ He further bemoans not being able to kill while in the Marines, saying that he would ‘look at other Marines and, you know, want to be like them.’ The former Marine, who served in Iraq, admitted to the six killings but died in custody late last year before ever facing trial. Investigators told the Los Angeles Times they believe he ingested Ajax household cleaner to commit suicide. His trial was set to start early this year.","Itzcoatl Ocampo admitted to the murders of six people - four homeless men, a mother and her son .

"By . Darren Boyle . Several beaches in Perth, Australia have been shut down because of a 16ft 'monster' great white shark has been patrolling the water. The killer shark almost forced a whale to beach on the shore as it searched for food off the coast of Western Australia. In the dramatic footage captured by helicopter, the shark can be seen following the whale less than 100 metres from the shore. Scroll down for video . The 16ft great white, pictured, was spotted trailing a whale just 100 metres from the beach in Perth, Western Australia . The shark was chasing a whale, pictured, although the authorities in Perth were forced to close a number of beaches for several hours because of the great white . The shark was observed by a man on a jet-ski, pictured as it swam up and down the coast . Perth has been dubbed 'the shark attack capital of the world' after a recent upsurge in incidents. During the period September 2011 and July 2012 there were five fatal attacks and numerous near-misses involving sharks - including the terrifying great white. Following one attack, only the victim's damaged speedos were recovered from the ocean. Eyewitnesses watched the drama from the safety of the shore . The great white shark forced the closure of City Beach in Perth, western Australia . One witness told KXAN in Australia: 'First of all I saw the whale, and then I could see something following it. And then people were saying, ""what's pursuing it?"" 'And yea, then it was clear, it was a shark.' Another witness claimed: 'I've never seen anything like it. It was huge.' Surf Life Saving Western Australia said they tracked the monster beast north. According to SLS WA most sharks in Australian waters are 'harmless' to humans. To reduce they chance of shark attack, they advise that swimmers should avoid the water at dawn or dusk, or in river mouths. They also suggest it is inadvisable to swim around schools of baitfish.","Several beaches closed as 'monster' great white shark patrolled off-shore .

"By . Associated Press . A pit bull that mauled a four-year-old boy earlier this year will spend the rest of its life in an animal shelter set up in an old jail instead of being put to death - after a man who styles himself as 'America's toughest sheriff' stepped in. Phoenix Municipal Court Judge Deborah Griffith said the dog named Mickey will be housed in the no-kill shelter opened in 2000 by Maricopa County's colorful sheriff Joe Arpaio, an animal lover who offered to take in the four-year-old pit bull. Griffith had declared the dog vicious at a hearing a month ago but declined to have him euthanized after animal-rights advocates came to its defense. Instead, she ordered Mickey to be neutered and defanged and gave the Lexus Project, a New York-based animal-rights group and the dog's trustee, 30 days to find a rehabilitation center or shelter to take him. The judge said the dog could not be put up for adoption. Mickey, a pit bull, attacked a four-year-old boy in February and will now spend the rest of his life in an animal shelter set up in an old jail by the sheriff for metropolitan Phoenix . Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio showed his soft side by taking the pit bull in himself . The Feb. 20 attack left 4-year-old Kevin Vicente with a broken eye socket and jaw, and the boy has months, if not years, of reconstructive surgery ahead of him. The case touched off a polarizing Internet debate on mercy, blame and animal violence, leading to candlelight vigils and riling up thousands of animal lovers on social media who placed blame with the dog's owners and child's baby sitter. Donations and gifts from around the world have flowed in for Kevin since the dog bit the boy in the face. Animal advocates say both the dog and boy are victims and a baby sitter watching the child was negligent in letting him play near the animal. They also argued the owner was fostering aggression by keeping the dog chained up. 'I expect to be the sheriff forever': Joe Arpaio is confident he'll be around to look after Mickey . The sheriff, who is known nationally for his immigration enforcement efforts and housing jail inmates in tents, testified that he was confident that Mickey would be housed at the shelter for the rest of the dog's life. Arpaio also said he didn't get involved in the case to get publicity. Later in the day, the sheriff will testify at a deposition in a civil rights lawsuit that the U.S. Justice Department filed against his office alleging racial profiling, retaliation against critics and other accusations. Arpaio denies those claims. At the dog's hearing, the question was raised of what would become of the animal if Arpaio is no longer sheriff. 'I expect to be the sheriff forever,' the 81-year-old sheriff quipped. The judge pressed Arpaio on what would happen to the animals in his shelter if a future sheriff were to end the shelter program. Arpaio answered that any sheriff who would close such a program wouldn't get re-elected. A supporter of the dog, Veronica Lee, said Mickey will be able to enjoy more freedoms in Arpaio's shelter than at another county facility where he's currently being held. 'Today, justice was served for Mickey,' she said. Griffith also denied a request from a lawyer representing the dog to rescind her order that Mickey be defanged. Attorney John Schill said it would make more sense to give the $2,500 the procedure costs to the injured child's family. Schill said the defanging wouldn't result in the dog losing his canine teeth, but rather they would be cut down and capped to match the height of the other teeth. 'Kevin's injuries are so vast and so devastating that $2,500 is really just a drop in the bucket,' Griffith said, adding that she doesn't want the dog to harm another person.","Four-year-old pit bull, Mickey, taken in by Sheriff Joe Arpaio .

Diren Dede, from Hamburg, was killed when 29-year-old Markus Kaarma fired four shotgun blasts into his garage after Dede set off home intruder alarms inside. It is not clear what Dede was doing inside the garage. Julia Reinhardt, spokesman for the . German consulate in San Fransisco, said the investigation should make it . clear it is illegal to kill an unarmed juvenile just because he is trespassing. Scroll down for video . The German consulate in San Fransisco has demanded justice today after exchange student Diren Dede, 17, was shot to death in the early hours of Sunday . Dede was killed after Markus Kaarma fired four shotgun blasts into his garage after Dede entered and set off intruder alarms. It is not known what Dede was doing in the garage . 'We consider what happened completely out of proportion to the probable risk,' Reinhardt added. Meanwhile Dede's father, Celal, has travelled in Missoula to collect his son's body from his host family. He arrived last night with a family friend but refused to comment on his son's death. At the time of Dede's killing, the teenager was studying at Missoula's Big Sky High School and was due to leave the U.S. after the school term ended in just six weeks. Just days before the fatal shooting, Kaarma told a woman that his house had been broken into  twice and he had been staying up at night, waiting to shoot an intruder, court records said. Kaarma's attorney, Paul Ryan, said his . client plans to plead not guilty to a charge of deliberate homicide . because Montana law allows homeowners to protect their residences with . deadly force when they believe they are going to be harmed. There had been a number of break-ins . in the neighborhood and Kaarma believed the police weren't doing . anything about it, Ryan said. 'We . know with no question the individual entered the garage. Kaarma didn't . know who he was, his intent or whether he was armed,' Ryan said. Prosecutors allege the 29-year-old wild . land firefighter shot into his garage without warning after an intruder . tripped sensors he had installed. Kaarma . and his partner have remained in their home since he was released on . $30,000 bond on Monday. A sign on their front door Wednesday told . visitors not to ring the bell. According . to the Missoulian, Kaarma and his wife have received anonymous death . threats on Facebook and are now afraid to leave their home. Last night Dede's father (not pictured) arrived to collect his son's body and visit Dede's host family, Kate Walker (centre) and Randy Smith (right). Dede's soccer coach and teacher Jay Bostrom is pictured left . Just days before Dede was shot dead, Kaarma allegedly told neighbours he had been staying up at night and waiting to shoot an intruder after his house was broken into twice . An official from the German consulate is in Missoula to assist Celal Dede in recovering the body and to meet with local law enforcement and prosecutors, Reinhardt said. 'This is very important to us, and she is there to put pressure on the authorities to investigate thoroughly,' Reinhardt said. 'We don't have any doubt that this will happen.' Dede's family in Hamburg told the German newspaper Bild the family has lived in Germany since 1977, and Diren has two sisters ages 19 and 21. He was to be in the U.S. for just another six weeks, but now the family plans a burial in Turkey, the newspaper reported. Diren Dede played soccer for his Missoula high school and in Germany. His former team in Hamburg was to play a charity match Wednesday to help the family pay for the funeral and other costs.","Diren Dede, 17, shot on Sunday morning in a garage in Missoula, Montana .

'It was kind of comic relief for our family because you didn't know when Ryan was going to bring it up or what he was going to say. I liked it because he kind of broke the stigma a little bit.' Tight-knit: Ryan Lewis pictured as a child with his mother Julie . Undiagnosed until 1990, Julie didn't know she had HIV while pregnant with Ryan or his sister, but fortunately she didn't pass it on her children. 'I was very lucky to have a 25 percent chance of infection and to not be infected,' said the Grammy Award-winning producer. And after 30 years of living with the disease, Julie also finds a lot to be thankful for. 'I cherish [every milestone],' she said. 'It's a miracle that I've been so lucky to not only be at their graduations and weddings, but this past year, my two daughters both had babies and I was there for delivery. It's really been a huge blessing.' Scroll down for video . Brave: Ryan Lewis is celebrating his mother Julie Lewis beating the odds and surviving 30 years on from her HIV positive diagnosis by creating the 30/30 Project to raise money for affordable healthcare worldwide . Julie Lewis found out she was HIV positive in 1990, six years after she contracted it via a blood transfusion following the birth of her eldest child, Teresa (pictured) Remarkable: Julie Lewis has lived with AIDS for 30 years. No one else in her family have contracted it . Ryan first disclosed  his mother was HIV positive last week. He made the revelation as he and Macklemore announced their foundation of the 30/30 Project, a nonprofit to raise money for affordable healthcare worldwide, and launched an indiegogo page for it. Writing on the foundation’s website, Ryan said: 'In 1984, Juile Lewis gave birth to her first daughter, Teresa. Due to a complicated pregnancy, she needed a blood transfusion and at that moment, was infected with HIV.' Macklemore also spoke out in a YouTube video for their foundation, saying: 'What a lot of people don't know is that Ryan Lewis' mom has lived with HIV for 30 years. 'Today we celebrate her life as a survivor with an initiative to bring healthcare to the areas of the world that need it most.' Ryan also revealed that his mother did not know she had HIV when she was pregnant with him or his sister and they were fortunate to be born healthy despite a 25 per cent risk of contracting it. Collaborators: Ryan has teamed up with his musical collaborator Macklemore to create the nonprofit foundation . He added: 'When she was finally diagnosed, she was given only a few years to live. By that time, she had already given birth to two other children, Laura and Ryan. They each had a 25% chance of being born HIV+, but we were both extremely fortunate (today, the risk of a mother passing HIV to her baby is 2% or less if she is being treated). 'And thanks to advanced medicine and healthcare available here in the U.S., Julie has survived despite her odds. This year marks the 30th anniversary of Julie’s survival, but many are not so lucky.' Now to celebrate his mother defeating the odds and surviving 30 years on from from her diagnosis, Ryan has teamed up with Macklemore to create the charity which will work to build health centres around the world. In honor of his mother, Ryan has the international AIDS symbol - a red ribbon - tattooed on his arm . They are aiming to raise at least $100,000. He added: 'To honour the thirty years my mom has been a survivor, our family is raising funds to build health centres worldwide that will stand strong for at least thirty years. We're calling it the 30/30 Project. 'We are partnering with Construction for Change, a Seattle-based nonprofit, to carry out construction. And we have local partners on the ground, such as Partners in Health, to run and operate the health facilities long-term. We want to give hope to women and families in other parts of the world who lack access to quality, affordable healthcare. 'With this amazing past year I've had, I am honored to be the first donor for the 30/30 Project, jumpstarting the construction of the first health center in Malawi. I am asking you to join my family and see how far we can take this...' Lewis has previously spoken about how close he is to his parents and his two older sisters. He was born into a middle-class, conservative Christian family who moved from Puyallup to Spokane, Washington, when he was two. It wasn't until 1994, at the age of six, did his parents - who both worked for nonprofits - explain to him about AIDS and that his mother had it. Julie Lewis contracted HIV following the birth of her eldest daughter Teresa (left) in 1984. It wasn't until six years later - after having another daughter, Laura (right) and son Ryan - that she was diagnosed . 'This was an era when people were really shunned for having HIV,' Julie Lewis told Inlander in February last year. 'So when we moved to Spokane, we didn’t actually go public telling people for four more years.' Julie then took the brave step of becoming part of the Spokane HIV/AIDS Speakers Bureau. 'It was a really interesting upbringing for my kids because literally most of the people who were on that speakers bureau, who were really good friends of our family, have died,' she said. Ryan said it had a profound effect on him . 'I think it really just opened up the door, as a kid, to life experiences that most of my friends didn’t know anything about,' he said. 'On one hand, you could look at it as a really hard, sh---y life thing; on the other hand, she’s been healthy for years. 'I didn’t get it, my sisters didn’t get it, my dad didn’t get it. 'It could’ve been a totally different thing. 'I could not be here. 'And she could not be here. 'But she is.' In honor of his mother, Ryan has a tattoo on his right arm of an intertwined red ribbon - a variation of the international AIDS symbol. Thankful: The 26-year-old also told People magazine :'I was very lucky to have a 25 percent chance of infection and to not be infected', pictured at a concert in August 2013 .","Ryan was six when he found out about his mother's HIV diagnosis which made him 'fearful' for her life .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . One in three drivers is so clueless when it comes to road signs that they cannot even recognise the symbol for the national speed limit, a survey claims. A quarter of us are also unaware that blue motorway signs also explain the speed limit, while one in seven motorists mistakenly thought that 'slippery road' warning sign meant that the road had been freshly painted. Eight per cent of drivers admitted they were baffled by the common 'road narrowing' sign, while almost a fifth said they did not know that when driving in a built-up area the speed limit is 30mph unless signs say otherwise. The scale of ignorance was revealed in a survey of 2,000 drivers by car insurers More Than. The results also found that a 'worrying' proportion of drivers regularly ignore speed limits and drive as fast as they want to. More than a third (36 per cent) said they disregard 30mph limits, travelling at an avergae of 38mph, while 32 per cent said they break 47mph limits, going 47mph on average instead. On motorways, even more people admitted to ignoring the law, with 43 per cent breaking the 70mph in favour of an average speed of 81mph. More Than . spokesman Janet Connor said: 'This research shows there’s a worrying . number of drivers for whom speeding is an acceptable everyday behaviour. 'Couple this with a shocking ignorance when it comes to the most common road signs, and you’ve got a recipe for road disaster.' The . large-scale confusion over road signs comes weeks after Transport . Secretary Patrick McLoughlin called for hundreds of thousands of . 'pointless' signs to be torn down. Whatever could it be? A large proportion of drivers couldn't recognise this sign . ‘Over . the past two decades we’ve seen a huge rise in the number of . unnecessary signs blotting the landscapes of our towns and cities’, he . said. ‘Many . of the signs that go up are simply not needed and it has got to stop. As well as spoiling otherwise beautiful areas of the country, pointless . signs just confuse drivers and make the roads less safe.' A spokesman for road safety charity Brake said: 'The research suggests a significant proportion of drivers seem to think it is okay to break the laws of the road. 'It . can never be acceptable and we urge all drivers to respect road safety . laws and recognise that such laws exist to help save lives.' James Barter, from Southampton, Hants, admits struggling to identify some of the road signs - despite passing his test ten years ago. The 28-year-old said: 'I passed my driving test when I was 18 and I still struggle to tell what certain signs mean. 'There are so many and some of the signs are not very clear or obvious.'

The announcement by Mahmoud Abbas appeared to be an attempt to reach out to the Israeli people at a time of deep crisis in longrunning, but so far fruitless, peace talks. But Mr Netanyahu, Israel's hardline premier, responded by telling Mr Abbas he must end his reconciliation with rival Palestinian group Hamas, the elected government of Gaza.

"By . Associated Press . and Francesca Chambers . Seeking to ratchet up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Barack Obama said the United States levied news sanctions on Monday on Russian individuals and companies in retaliation for Moscow's alleged provocations in Ukraine. Targets of the sanctions include Russian government officials and high-technology exports to Russia's defense industry. 'The goal here is not to go after Mr. Putin personally,' Obama said. 'The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he's engaging in could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul.' Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama announced on Monday that the United States was levying news sanctions on Russian individuals and companies in retaliation for alleged the country's alleged provocations in Ukraine . In a statement sent to reporters on Monday morning, the White House clarified that the Department of the Treasury would be imposing sanctions on seven Russian government officials, 'including two members of President Putinâ€™s inner circle.' These officials will have their U.S. visas banned and their assets frozen. Meanwhile, 17 companies linked to Putin will have their assets frozen. Of those 17 companies, Treasury will further sanction 13 by disallowing exports from the U.S. to those companies. The statement did neither specified which government officials nor Russian companies would be sanctioned. The Departments of Commerce and State will also begin denying export applications for any 'high-technology items that could contribute to Russiaâ€™s military capabilities.' Existing export licenses in that category will be revoked, according to the White House's statement. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said the U.S. is prepared to 'impose still greater costs on Russia if the Russian leadership continues these provocations.' Future sanctions could affect individuals and businesses working in Russia's financial services, energy, metals and mining, engineering and defense industries. In a statement to CNN, Russia's deputy minister . for foreign relations Sergey Ryabkov called the sanctions 'meaningless, shameful, and disgusting.' 'The goal here is not to go after Mr. Putin personally,' Obama said. 'The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he's engaging in could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul.' Obama announced the sanctions during a news conference in the Philippines, his final stop on a four-country Asia swing. The president has been building a case for this round of penalties throughout his trip, both in his public comments and in private conversations with European leaders. The new sanctions are intended to build on earlier U.S. and European visa bans and asset freezes imposed on Russian officials, including many in Putin's inner circle, after Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine last month. White House officials say they decided last week to impose additional penalties after determining that Russia had not lived up to its commitments under a fragile diplomatic accord aimed at easing the crisis in Ukraine. But the U.S. held off on implementing the sanctions in order to coordinate its actions with the European Union, which could also announce new penalties as early as Monday. Obama announced the sanctions during a news conference in the Philippines, his final stop on a four-country Asia swing. The failed diplomatic agreement reached in Geneva just over a week ago called on the Kremlin to use its influence to get pro-Russian insurgents to leave the government buildings they have occupied in eastern Ukraine. But those forces have not only balked at leaving those buildings, but have also stepped up their provocations, including capturing European military observers who were paraded by the militants before the media Sunday. Despite the deteriorating situation, Obama said Russia still has the opportunity to resolve the Ukraine crisis through a diplomatic path. But he voiced pessimism about whether the new sanctions package would be enough to change Putin's calculus. 'We don't yet know whether it's going to work,' he said. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters during her daily . briefing on Monday that the U.S. had not seen any signs from Russia that it would begin abiding by the Geneva agreement. The EU is Russia's biggest trading partner, giving it much . greater economic leverage over Moscow than the U.S. has. However, the EU . treads more carefully in imposing sanctions since Russia is also one of . its biggest oil and gas suppliers. European diplomats were set to meet in Brussels on Monday to discuss slapping asset freezes and travel bans on more officials associated with Russia's actions on Ukraine. The EU has so far sanctioned 33 individuals over the Crimea annexation. The EU was likely to add another 15 individuals to its sanctions list at the meeting and discuss further steps, a diplomat from a major EU country said. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official decision had not yet been announced, declined to elaborate on which officials would be targeted.","President Barack Obama announced the new sanctions at a press conference in the Philippines, his final stop on a week long trip to Asia .

"By . Jennifer Newton . David Ivin, 36, died after being pinned to the ground following a incident with bouncers at his work's Christmas party . A salesman died when his heart and lungs stopped working after he was allegedly pinned to the ground with so much force outside a Christmas party. David Ivin, who worked for Saga left the company Christmas party at Leas Cliffe Hall in Folkestone, Kent to go outside for a cigarette, only to be turned away by security staff when he tried to return. The 36-year-old continued to try to gain entry to the venue but was allegedly pushed in the chest by bouncer Martin Barnwell and nearly fell down some stairs, Canterbury Crown Court heard. The court was also told that security staff, Martin Barnwell, 30, and Brent Wright, 36, forced him to the floor and administered a dangerous choke hold. It also heard that there was no natural cause for his heart and lungs to stop operating properly and the restraint of Mr Ivin was 'unnecessary' and 'excessive'. The incident happened on December 13, 2012 and the prosecution say Barnwell and colleague Wright took hold of Mr Ivin's arms and dragged him outside when he tried to re-enter the building. Duncan Atkinson, prosecuting, said there was an angry confrontation and both men, who are now on trial, ended up on top of Mr Ivin. He told the jury yesterday: 'There was no natural cause for his heart and lungs to cease operating properly. 'We say the restraint of Mr Ivin was unnecessary and the manner and duration was excessive and contrary to proper training and techniques. 'It posed an obvious and serious risk to Mr Ivin's health. 'What Mr Ivin's intoxication cannot do is absolve the defendants of responsibility or permit them to have acted in any way they chose towards him. 'Unsurprisingly, door security staff are trained that those who are intoxicated can be more aggressive and it stresses the need to behave calmly and professionally. 'During the confrontation, Mr Ivin was restrained by Barnwell and Wright, both of whom held him on the floor. 'Wright jumped on Mr Ivin's back to force him to the floor and then administered a dangerous neck or choke hold. 'The duration of the restraint by both of them was both considerable and excessive.' A post mortem revealed that small burst blood vessels in Mr Ivin's eye were caused by 'sustained pressure for at least 20 to 30 seconds'. Brent Wright and Martin Barnwell both deny manslaughter at Canterbury Crown Court, pictured . This was said to prevent normal blood flow and caused an irregular heartbeat pattern. Mr Atkinson added: 'It is clear these two men owed Mr Ivin a duty of care. 'They were responsible for maintaining security at the hall where he was a guest. 'This was gross negligence. The post mortem showed that Wright's hold had been used too long and with too much force, causing significant damage to the neck.' The door supervisors worked for 219 Security who had been recruited to provide the security at the party. Wright, from Folkestone, Kent, and Barnwell from Dover, Kent, both deny manslaughter. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","David Ivin died after allegedly being pushed by bouncers at Christmas party .

"By . Carl Markham, Press Association . Liverpool striker Luis Suarez says 'nothing is going to happen' regarding his future at the club as he focuses on fulfilling a dream and winning the title. The PFA player of the year has scored 30 league goals this season, which has only enhanced his reputation as one of the world's best players. Despite only signing a new lucrative contract at Anfield in December, Suarez is still being linked with the likes of Real Madrid. Going nowhere: Luis Suarez has insisted he is not leaving Liverpool despite being linked with Real Madrid . Hotshot: Suarez has been in brilliant form this season, scoring 30 goals for top-of-the-league Liverpool . When Suarez was asked in an interview with Uruguay television station Canal 10 whether they should be contacting him in England or Spain next season he replied: 'I'm very happy here and my family is happy here. 'Don't worry nothing is going to happen to me. If we could win the Premier League and bring the trophy home it would be incredible, a dream come true.' That dream may be reliant on neighbours Everton doing Liverpool a favour and beating Manchester City at Goodison Park on Saturday. Should City drop points then the Reds' destiny would be back in their hands, having let it slip with a frustrating 2-0 home defeat by Chelsea last Sunday. 'I'm still upset, it was so frustrating, we couldn't find spaces and we made a mistake and it was hard to deal with,"" said Suarez of the loss at Anfield. Real interest: Madrid - who already boast Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale - are said to want Suarez . The best: Suarez was voted PFA Player of the Year by his fellow professionals . 'We knew the game was going to be hard and tight but it was frustrating when they were using up time. 'I was upset because of our mistake; we all got nervous and lost control. It was impossible to find spaces to get in. 'We are hoping Man City loses some points but in the Premier League you never know, anything is possible. 'Now we have to win the next two games and it is not going to be easy.' Work to do: Brendan Rodgers and Steven Gerrard speak at Melwood as they prepare to face Crystal Palace . Suarez, who in December 2011 was banned for eight matches after being found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra, was pictured with team-mate Philippe Coutinho earlier in the week showing his support for Dani Alves after the Barcelona defender had a banana thrown at him during the match at Villarreal. 'The picture with Coutinho was because I didn't like what happened,"" he added. 'So we had to do something with Phil. I felt I had to do something for my my friends.' While Liverpool will watch events at Goodison Park with keen interest this weekend, they have to wait until Monday to play their penultimate match at Crystal Palace as they remain in the hunt for a first title since 1990. Say no to racism: Suarez posted this photo to his Twitter account in support of Dani Alves . The club have taken the step of issuing a specific warning to travelling fans about counterfeit tickets. 'Liverpool Football Club has been contacted by a number of fans voicing concerns over supporters who intend to travel to Selhurst Park for Monday night's sell-out fixture against Crystal Palace without tickets,' said a statement. 'The club is reminding its supporters to be aware of counterfeit tickets and to only travel to Selhurst Park if they have an official ticket. 'The club is working closely with Crystal Palace to ensure that fans with official tickets can access the stadium, with extra LFC stewards on hand to assist with security at Selhurst Park. Up next: Liverpool will face Tony Pulis' hard to beat Crystal Palace side as they continue to fight for the title . 'Merseyside Police will also be supporting the Metropolitan Police with any illegal ticketing issues around the stadium prior to kick-off. 'All tickets purchased are the responsibility of the supporter whose name is on the ticket. 'Any breach of regulations may be subject to further investigation that could ultimately result in the club pursuing a ban for each person involved for future LFC games.'","Luis Suarez signed a lucrative new contract at Liverpool in December .

"By . Mark Duell . 'Deep hatred': Ian Forman made a list of mosques near his home which he referred to as his 'target' Eyes  glued to his computer screen and wearing his treasured SS cap, this is the Hitler-obsessed fanatic who planned to blow up a string of mosques. Ian Forman sat in his bedroom writing racist rants on the internet and making explosives which he hid under his bed. The 42-year-old boasted to friends that the devices were packed with ball bearings and nails, and made a YouTube video about ‘lighting up the sky’ with burning mosques. He was so obsessed with the Nazis that friends called him Adolf and he kept an SS uniform in the three-bedroom house he shared with his retired parents. As this image from home-made webcam footage shows, he would often wear parts of the uniform in his bedroom while he plotted the murder of Muslims living nearby. The video was released yesterday by police after Forman was jailed for ten years for terror offences. Kingston Crown Court heard he appeared a respectable man, with a university degree, a wife and a job. But underneath, he had a ‘deep hatred’ of Muslims and made a list of mosques to target near his home in Birkenhead, Merseyside. Scroll down for video . Jailed for 10 years: A video still taken from footage issued by Greater Manchester Police of Forman, 42 . Yesterday, even his own barrister described him as ‘rather pathetic’. Sentencing, Judge Paul Dodgson called him ‘an unlikely figure’ to be convicted on terror charges. He said Forman was living in a fantasy world. ‘One of the abiding images ... is the video you took with a webcam, of yourself with your SS hat on in your bedroom, typing what I strongly suspect were racist rants on messaging services,’ he added. Wearing glasses and dressed in a blue shirt and grey tie, Forman waved to his wife Moira as he was led from the dock. During his trial, he was described as evil after the court heard he referred to his list of mosques as his ‘dreck ziel’ – a German phrase meaning ‘dirt target’. Liked by Forman: The 42-year-old would-be terrorist expressed right-wing views on social media and spoke of his admiration of Adolf Hitler (left) and mass murderer Anders Breivik (right) He researched how to make bombs online before police found chemicals and a homemade explosive device in his room last June.

During the investigation, he wrote a letter to police warning them not to side with ‘the Muslim filth’. David Mason QC said in mitigation: ‘He perhaps came across as someone rather pathetic, very bright, holding appalling views but not your average terrorist.’ Forman, who graduated in German and Spanish at Liverpool John Moores University, is understood to have been operating alone. He was convicted of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts following an 11-day trial in March. He was told yesterday he would serve half of his jail sentence before being let out on licence. His wife, who lived apart from him at the time of his plotting, has vowed to stand by him while he is in prison.

"By . Daniel Martin . Officials are worried that secondary school children are unable to resist the temptation to snack on junk food . Fast food takeaways should be banned from near schools in a bid to curb child obesity, the government’s public health quango has urged. Public Health England has brought out tough new guidance for councils, urging planners to refuse permission for burger bars, chip shops and pizza parlours within five minutes’ walking distance of schools. Officials are worried that secondary school children, many of whom are allowed to leave school premises at lunch time, are unable to resist the temptation to snack on junk food if it is available nearby. The dramatic guidance is designed to turn around the worrying levels of obesity in our society. Two-thirds of English adults, one-fifth of children in reception and a third of those in the final year of primary school are obese or overweight. Last week Jamie Oliver demanded a clampdown on takeaway shops that tempt pupils away at lunchtime. The TV chef called for urgent action over the ‘madness’ which allows junk food operators to still open up ‘within spitting distance’ of some schools. In an interview with the Times Educational Supplement, Mr Oliver said: ‘You can’t have one arm of the government investing money in food education and school lunches, and then have another part allowing junk food, en masse, to be licensed and given permission to trade within a stone’s throw of a school on every corner.’ Research commissioned by PHE reveals that takeaways are a much bigger problem in some authorities than others, with a massive disparity across the country in the density of outlets per head of population. Those with the highest number tend to be in the most deprived areas of the country, with the density varying from 15 takeaways per 100,000 people in the richest areas to 172 in the poorest. In turn, poorer people tend to be more unhealthy. Levels of obesity among the 10 per cent most deprived children in the last year of primary school are double rates among the 10 per cent least deprived. The PHE report, distributed to all councils, calls on them to use the planning process to ‘modify the environment’ in order to prevent easy access to ‘energy-dense food’. One of the dietary trends in recent years has been an increase in the proportion of food eaten outside the home, which is more likely to be high in calories, said a report by Public Health England . It said: ‘One of the dietary trends in . recent years has been an increase in the proportion of food eaten . outside the home, which is more likely to be high in calories. ‘Of particular concern are hot food takeaways, which tend to sell food that is high in fat and salt, and low in fibre, fruit and vegetables.’ The report added: ‘One important action is to modify the environment so that it does not promote sedentary behaviour or provide easy access to energy-dense food. ‘The aim is to help make the healthy choice the easy choice via environmental change and action at population and individual levels. ‘Local authorities have a range of legislative and policy levers at their disposal, alongside wider influences on healthy lifestyles, that can help to create places where people are supported to maintain a healthy weight. ‘Public health professionals should work with their colleagues across local authorities to use these and other approaches to maximise health benefits. Last week Jamie Oliver demanded a clampdown on takeaway shops that tempt pupils away at lunchtime . ‘Planning authorities can influence the built environment and reduce the extent to which it promotes obesity.’ Although the PHE admits there is little . research linking elevated levels of obesity with high concentrations of . fast food outlets, it says there is a ‘theoretical’ argument that there . is likely to be a link. It says a priority for councils should be to protect children from the temptation of spending their money in takeaways at lunchtimes or on the way home. The 38-year-old TV chef challenged political parties to make the issue part of their election campaigns . ‘Improving the quality of the food environment around schools has the potential to influence children’s food-purchasing habits, potentially influencing their future diets,’ the report said. ‘However, it is important to note that taking action on hot food takeaways is only part of the solution, as it does not address sweets and other high-calorie food that children can buy in shops near schools.’ The report points out that a number of London boroughs have already brought in bans on takeaways near schools. Most use a 400 metre exclusion zone, which is equivalent to five minutes’ walk; but Brighton and Hove uses a larger zone of 800 metres. To ensure such zones avoiding the danger of losing appeals, PHE suggests some ways they can strengthen their case. ‘Many hot food takeaways may generate substantial litter in an area well beyond their immediate vicinity,’ he said. ‘Discarded food waste and litter attracts foraging animals and pest species. ‘Hot food takeaways may reduce the visual appeal of the local environment and generate night-time noise. Short-term car parking outside takeaways may contribute to traffic congestion. ‘Improving access to healthier food in deprived communities may contribute to reducing health inequalities.’ PHE also suggests councils could use street trading legislation to restrict fast food vans from setting up shops near schools. Hillingdon Council in London, for example, has banned ice cream vans near schools and nurseries. The report also called for councillors to be appointed as healthy eating czars to liaise between planners and the NHS.","Officials warn secondary school pupils cannot resist temptation of junk food .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Tragic: Andrew Kirkman, 20, left notes outside his tent in an Oxford meadow warning passers-by of the poisonous fumes . An Oxford University physics and philosophy student used a lethal mix of poison to kill himself inside a tent at the end of term, a coroner heard today. Andrew Kirkman, 20, who was in his second year at Balliol College, was found dead inside the tent by a man walking with his 11-year-old son. The pair found two A4 sheets of paper on the floor next . to the tent door, one with a warning triangle with a . skull, stating: 'For the police, this is a suicide attempt,' Oxford Coroner's Court heard. The other warned: 'You should not open this tent without protective gear.' Mr Kirkman, who went to Rickmansworth School in Hertfordshire, had been missing lectures and disclosed feeling of depression to a university chaplain and his GP, who prescribed anti-depressant. However, the undergraduate did not to tell his parents what he was going through before his body was found at midday on December 8 last year. That day, his mother Wendy had driven to his student accommodation in Oxford to take him back to the family's home in Northwood, north west London. He was due to catch a plane to spend Christmas with his girlfriend in Brazil the next day. However, Mrs Kirkman spent hours waiting for him before police arrived in the afternoon to inform her of his death. Walker Crispin Maceijewski told Oxford Coroner's Court he did not read the pages on the floor before peered inside the tent, which smelled of 'rotton eggs'. He said: 'I opened the zip about eight to nine inches and looked inside. I immediately saw someone lying in the tent. He was lying on his back with eyes open. I said something like, ""Are you all right, mate?"" The 20-year-old had been due to fly to Brazil with his girlfriend for Christmas the day after he was found dead on December 8, 2013, by a man and his son . Walker Crispin Maceijewski told Oxford Coroner's Court he did not read the notes on the floor before opening the tent in Port Meadow, Oxford, to check if the person inside was all right . 'He was 19 or 20 years old and he was wearing clean, smart clothes. I immediately thought he was dead.' Officials from the Chemical, . Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Team were drafted in at midday . after strong chemical odours were detected coming from the tent. Within an hour all of Port Meadow had been sealed off and specialist teams began their examinations. Mr Kirkman was pronounced dead at the scene and six fume victims were taken to hospital. His girlfriend confirmed in a phone call with police that the student once told her he fantasised about killing himself in a field in Oxford. Pathologist Professor Ian Roberts confirmed the presence of cannabis in the young manâ€™s blood sample. Coroner Darren Salter at Oxford Coroner's Court (pictured) recorded a verdict of suicide caused by poisoning. Mrs Kirkman paid tribute to her 'amazing' son, adding: 'everything was fun when he was around' Recording a suicide verdict, Coroner Darren Salter said it had been an 'unusual case.' The cause of death was given as poisoning. Wendy Kirkman and her tearful husband Michael sat at the front of the court with a framed photograph of Andrew on the desk. Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Kirkman paid tribute to her son and said: 'He was a joy to be with - everything was fun when he was around. 'Andrew was an amazing young man. He spent an inordinate amount of time assisting others and was a force for good in every community he was involved in.' She said the presence of 250 mourners at his funeral was 'testament to how many lives he touched.' Mr Kirkman is also survived by two younger brothers, who were not at the inquest. Sir Drummond Bone, master of Balliol College, said after the inquest: 'The College has been deeply saddened by Andrewâ€™s tragic death last December. We saw how deeply he was loved and valued at a college memorial service for him, attended by his family and many of his friends. 'Andrew was a friendly, thoughtful and kind young man who is very much missed and our thoughts and sympathies continue to be with his family.'","Andrew Kirkman, 20, was found in meadow by man walking with his son .

"By . Becky Barrow . House prices are rising at their fastest pace for nearly seven years with the average home costing nearly £18,000 more than it did last year, the Nationwide said yesterday. Graham Beale, chief executive of the building society, warned: ‘We need to watch the situation carefully.’ In just one year, house prices have jumped by 10.9 per cent, the first time that annual house price inflation has been in double figures since 2010 and the highest rate since June 2007. But the Nationwide raised its fears about the growing gulf between what people earn and what they have to pay to buy a property. Graham Beale, chief executive of Nationwide building society warned that the rise in house prices needed to be watched 'carefully' The average worker with a full-time job earns around £27,000, but the average house price has jumped to £183,577, which is nearly seven times higher than their salary. Robert Gardner, chief economist at the Nationwide, Britain’s biggest building society, warned of the ‘wide margin’ between the rate at which house prices are rising and people’s pay rises. Official figures, from the Office for National Statistics, reveal the average pay rises is currently 1.7 per cent a year, compared to house price growth of 10.9 per cent a year. As a result, people’s pay is barely moving but house prices are rising rapidly. On Wednesday, the Land Registry said 33 homes a day are selling for more than £1million, with the majority found in London and the South East. Yesterday Nationwide said one in four homes in London are now sold for £500,000 or more, compared to only 13 per cent in 2007. ‘More than six per cent’ of properties sold in the capital cost more than £1million, it said.Mr Gardner said: ‘House price growth is outstripping income growth by a wide margin. ‘The risk is that, unless supply accelerates significantly, affordability will become stretched.’ In April last year, the average home cost £165,586. Today it costs £183,577, a rise of £17,991, the sort of pay rises which most workers can only dream about. New figures from the Office of National statistics show that house prices have increased by 10.9 percent over the past year . Jeremy Duncombe, director of the insurer Legal & General’s mortgage club, said: ‘It is extremely important that house price growth is kept at sustainable levels or the market risks over-heating. ‘The risk of a ‘bubble’ forming in the capital remains very real. A key part of controlling house price growth is to build more houses. ‘ Mr Beale also warned: ‘Prices are affected by the fact that not enough houses are being built to keep up with the number of households being formed, so demand is outstripping supply.’ To add to the pressure on homebuyers, the stamp duty bill is proving a growing burden. As house prices rises, the tax bill also grows. Clare Francis, from the comparison website Moneysupermarket, said stamp duty is ‘another obstacle hampering homeownership.’ She added: ‘The thresholds [at which stamp duty is charged] have been held at the same levels for years now. Rising property prices mean that an increasing number of first-time buyers have to pay the three per cent rate. ‘This isn’t right and it is time for the government to reform this tax.’ The Council of Mortgage Lenders said rising house prices are helping homeowners with an interest-only mortgage, which means they only pay the interest on the loan, but not the loan itself. Around 2.2million people have an interest only mortgage, and it said only ‘a relatively modest’ number have no plan for repaying the loan when the time comes. Over the last year, mortgage lenders have been contacting all homeowner with this type of loan, if it matures before the end of 2020, to discuss what they are planning to do.","Houses cost on average £18,000 more than twelve months ago .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Jailed: Abbi Kinsella was jailed today after stealing her elderly mother's £100,000 life savings - leaving her 'homeless, penniless and in debt' A lottery winner was jailed today after stealing her elderly mother's £100,000 life savings - leaving her 'homeless, penniless and in debt'. Abbi Kinsella, dubbed the 'wicked witch', stole the money from 88-year-old dementia sufferer, Margaret Bowyer, after her winnings ran out. She used £34,000 of the cash to feed her online bingo habit - while thousands more was spent on holidays in the exclusive resort of St Tropez in the South of France. Now, the 54-year-old, who won £175,000 on the lottery in 1999, has been jailed for four years after being convicted of four charges of stealing and admitting one offence of fraud. Stafford Crown Court heard that Mrs Bowyer had sold her own property in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, and banked money from the sale, before moving to Tamworth in Staffordshire. The widow rented a house next door to Kinsella's home, which has a sign outside featuring a black plastic crow above the warning: 'Beware of the witch'. But over the next three years, more than £61,000 was transferred from Mrs Bowyer's bank account to her daughter's, while a number of cash withdrawals were made, totalling more than £38,000. Meanwhile, Kinsella was spending thousands of pounds of her mother's money on online bingo and luxury holidays, as well as £200 on a Sky TV subscription, the court heard. After plundering the account, Kinsella cancelled her mother’s direct debit payments for her rent, gas, electric, water and council tax in April 2011. As a result, Mrs Bowyer was left with £20,000 in unpaid bills - and was eventually evicted from her home in November 2012. The pensioner, who was too ill to give evidence at court, is now in a care home for the elderly. Home: Kinsella, who won £175,000 on the lottery in 1999, stole the money from 88-year-old dementia sufferer, Margaret Bowyer, after her winnings ran out. Above, Kinsella's house (centre) in Tamworth, Staffordshire . Sign: The 54-year-old's house has a black circular sign on the outside wall, reading: 'Beware of the witch' Andrew Wallace, prosecuting, said . Kinsella had 'totally abused her position as Mrs Bowyer’s daughter ..... throwing her mother out on the street, penniless, and then lied about . it'. Meanwhile, Mark Nicholls, . defending, said the mother of two's partner, John Causer, 53, had 'turned his . back on her' and ended the relationship after reading in the press about what she had done. The couple had regularly held fancy dress parties at their modern three-bedroom terrace, according to neighbours, and Kinsella had been known to dress up as a witch. Warning: The sign sits under a black plastic crow . 'It is questionable whether she will ever see her mother in the future,' Mr Nicholls added. Social services referred Mrs Bowyer’s case to the police in November 2012 and her daughter was arrested a month later. When . questioned, Kinsella said she had stopped rent payments going out of . the account in April 2011 because the owner of the property owed them . some money for ‘doing the back garden’. She said she had restarted rent payments in cash, but hadn’t got any receipts for it. During an earlier trial, Kinsella, a one-time Avon lady, had denied stealing the cash, but a jury took just 20 minutes to convict her of four charges of theft from Mrs Bowyer. However, she did admit to making a false statement to her brother, Steve Bowyer, in which she claimed their mother’s money was in a bank account requiring 90 days' notice of withdrawal. Sentencing Kinsella, Judge Mark Eades told her: 'You betrayed your mother’s trust in a callous and unfeeling fashion. You bled her finances dry. We came to your trial here and you gave evidence. 'You lied and lied and lied and lied and as each lie was demonstrated to be false you lied upon lie. You are a serial liar who has no conscience at all. You enjoyed living way beyond your means. 'You had a win on the lottery, you won a substantial sum that you got through very quickly and I dare say you enjoyed the freedom that win gave you. But when that money ran out, it strikes me, you had difficulty coming to terms with the position you were in before your win.' Not at home: Kinsella has now been jailed for four years for four charges of stealing and one offence of fraud . In a Proceeds of Crime application, . Judge Eades ruled that Kinsella had benefited by £100,966 - but because . she has no assets, he ordered her to pay just £1. Following the trial, Detective Constable Mark Woodings, who investigated the case, branded Kinsella's actions 'heartless and callous'. He said: 'The victim is an extremely vulnerable elderly lady. When she became unable to manage her own financial affairs due to the onset of dementia, the family entrusted Kinsella to look after her interests and welfare. 'Kinsella went on to abuse that trust in a most heartless and callous way, stealing every penny of her mother’s life savings. She systematically and repeatedly helped herself to over £100,000 in order to feed a gambling habit and to live a life beyond her means. 'Her actions have left a proud lady homeless, penniless and in debt for the first time in her life. 'The family have found it difficult to comprehend and fully accept the lengths that Kinsella has gone to in order to steal from her own mother.'","Abbi Kinsella stole 88-year-old Margaret Bowyer's £100,000 life savings .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Labour's rising star Chuka Umunna has declared that he has no problem with people making 'a lot of money'. The shadow business secretary, tipped as a future party leader, even said Labour wanted to help people become millionaires. Mr Umunna's remarks echo former Cabinet minister Peter Mandelson - who famously said that Labour under Tony Blair was 'intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich'. Chuka Umunna, tipped as a future Prime Minister, is known to speak regularly with Blairite heavyweight Lord Mandelson . Mr Blair himself said he did not go into politics 'to make sure that David Beckham earns less money'. Mr Umunna's remarks appear in stark contrast to those of Labour leader Ed Miliband - who has vowed to create a more equal society. But the Labour frontbencher told The House magazine: 'I don’t have a problem with people making a lot of money, so long as they pay their taxes and it’s good for our economy.' He added: 'I’m very clear: we want to help people make their first million. Peter Mandelson, the former Business Secretary, is now a Labour peer. He was a key member of the New Labour government . 'If you set up a start-up and you increase you turnover to over a million, you will be employing people and delivering tax receipts to the Exchequer and helping Britain pay its way in the world. We should be saying that.' Mr Umunna also praised new Treasury minister Sajid Javid's successful career in banking. He said: 'I don’t have a problem with the fact that Sajid earned millions of pounds working in the City before he was elected. 'I have more of a problem with what he stands for and what he believes in and that’s what the focus should be.' The intervention comes after Mr Miliband earlier this year said 'tackling inequality is the new centre ground of politics'. After winning the Labour leadership in 2010 he said equality was 'at the very heart of why we need to move on from New Labour'. He said: 'During our years in power, we didn't do enough to stop the gap between rich and poor getting wider.' But Mr Umunna launched an impassioned defence of Mr Blair's record. The Labour MP said: 'We achieved a huge amount in office, and we should shout more loudly about it. 'We all know what the Conservative strategy will be, and that will be to argue that Labour crashed the car. 'Well, that is not the experience of my constituents when they look at the six new and improved health centres in Streatham, when they look at our safer neighbourhood teams in every ward, when they look at improved school buildings, reduced class sizes and the increased numbers of young people going to university for the first time in their family’s history. 'Don’t tell me we crashed the car, because we left this country in an immeasurably better state in 2010 than we found it in 1997 and Tony Blair has a huge amount to do with that. And people forget that.' Labour leader Ed Miliband and his shadow business secretary are close allies . Like Mr Blair, the shadow business secretary is religious. Mr Umunna said: 'My faith has definitely shaped my politics. 'I do try to go to Southwark [Cathedral] at least once a month, and get a bit of time away to reflect.  I wouldn’t say I’m majorly religious. But I am a believer, absolutely.' Mr Umunna also revealed his inspiration for joining the Labour party - former Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont. The Labour MP, who attended the private St Dunstan’s College school in south London, challenged Mr Lamont when he came to give a speech. He said: 'He got up and made the case for the Tories and said why we should support them. 'And I sat in my chair getting more and more agitated by what he was saying, so got up to ask a question, slightly forgetting that this man used to run the UK economy and here I am this 17 year-old challenging him. 'I said ""How on earth can you expect us to vote for you when you said you were going to cut taxes and you’ve actually put them up? And you’re jailing female prisoners who are in labour.’ “And of course the reaction in the hall was electric. People were laughing and clapping. 'And I finished asking the question, and was slightly shaking, going ""I can’t quite believe I’ve just done that"". 'And I always remember Norman said ""Are you quite finished yet?"" - and I carried on. 'I sat down thinking ""I can’t believe I’ve done this"". 'And that was the first time I thought maybe I could do politics at some point in the future.'","Shadow business secretary says Labour wants to see more millionaires .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Channel Five has been taken over by an American broadcaster for £450 million. MTV owner Viacom has agreed to buy Channel Five from Richard Desmond's Northern & Shell, it has been announced. The deal represents a significant profit on the £103.5 million Mr Desmond paid for the broadcaster in 2010, although it is thought to fall short of the £700 million price tag he had put on the channel. Channel Five, which broadcasts Big Brother, pictured, has been bought by US media giant Viacom for £450 million . Northern & Shell said the deal was subject to regulatory approval. Viacom chief executive Philippe Daumann said: 'The acquisition of Channel 5 accelerates Viacom's strategy in the UK, one of the world's most important and valuable media markets.' Channel Five was launched in 1997 and broadcasts popular shows such as Neighbours. Under Mr Desmond it revived Big Brother after it was ditched by Channel 4.

"By . Ray Massey . A Home Office minister was forced to make a humiliating apology  for what critics branded ‘a national embarrassment‘ after the UK’s main immigration computer crashed causing chaos air passengers. The 12-hour computer glitch forced passengers at airports across Britain to queue for up to four hours to get into the country as passport control staff were forced to process arrivals manually when they were no longer able to electronically scan their documents. Border Force staff called in back-up police on 999 emergency duty to Luton Airport amid reports of fighting among ‘angry and frustrated’ passengers in the main hall though no arrests were made. Huge queues of travellers jammed into a Heathrow arrivals hall after the UK Border Agency IT glitch caused chaos at airports across the country . There were also reports of fights breaking out at Gatwick Airport as passengers were stuck for up to four hours in queues and took to Twitter to vent their frustration about queues stretching ‘for miles’. Furious travellers described the scenes as ‘a disgrace and a national embarrassment’ with many complaining about a lack of information and water. As the Government launched an investigation into the cause of the computer meltdown, Immigration and security minister James Brokenshire apologised for the fiasco on a visit to Heathrow. He said: ‘Our engineers have been working through the night to fix the temporary IT problems and all ports are now functioning normally. ‘We apologise for the delays that some passengers experienced at passport controls yesterday, but security must remain our priority at all times.’ He added: ‘I visited Heathrow early this morning and have asked technical staff to continue to look into the incident to ensure lessons are learnt.’ Although non-EU passengers endured the brunt of the delays, it also caused waits of more than two hours of delay for UK citizens. Hundreds of people s[pent hours queuing at Gatwick's border control following the IT glitch which caused delays of up to four hours and affected every British airport . Problems on the UK’s immigration computer network began at airports and seaports around the country at about 2.30pm and quickly escalated over the next 12 hours. But it took Border Force until around 3am Thursday to install an electronic ‘patch’ to solve the damaging software failure. Eye-witness passengers said Border Force staff had told them that - with the electronic scans down - Home Secretary Theresa May had vetoed a switch to old style visual passport checks for UK and EU citizens and insisted that data be inputted manually, which added to delays. Passenger Simon Kalman, 56, from Golders’ Green in London told BBC Radio 5 Live how he had spent more than two hours at immigration with 2,000 other passengers after arriving late last night from Barcelona on an EasyJet flight. He said: ‘There was a bit of a punch up. It was organised chaos.’ ‘The Border force officers were trying their best. But as I understand it, having spoken to a chief officer, they had been almost pleading to just visually scan passports for UK and EU nationals so they didn’t have to input the information. But that was denied them. As the Government launched an investigation into the cause of the computer meltdown, Immigration and security minister James Brokenshire, pictured, apologised for the fiasco on a visit to Heathrow . ‘As a result, they had to input manually your name, date-of-birth and passport number and wait and see what came up. on their screen, which of course took an incredibly long time to process.’ Mr Kalman said: ‘Queues were long. People waited in excess of three hours. There was a lack of information to waiting passengers.’ ‘It was a total mess, there was limited water available and people were getting very frustrated. ‘There were heavily pregnant women, young children and babies.’ Another stricken passenger called Phil arriving at Luton from Paris told Radio 5 live at 1am:’It was bedlam. It was more than a glitch. That’s government spin.’ Josh Bone captured an image of the Luton chaos at 1am in a photograph showing hundreds in line with the caption: ‘Sort it out’. Bedfordshire Police confirmed they had been called to Luton Airport at around midnight specifically following a request by the Border Force to prevent ‘a breach of the peace.’ A police spokeswoman said: ‘We went down there because people were quite frustrated and angry. The Border Force called them in. They were concerned people were getting angry. 'There were about 800 people. They were a 999 response team. We sent people up there as a precaution to make sure there was no breach of the peace. No-one was arrested and no-one came forward as an assault victim.’ Elsewhere Passenger Kay Perry tweeted: ‘Gatwick airport chaos. Fights break out among passengers as queues reach for miles.’ And a passenger who had just arrived at Heathrow said: ‘This immigration queue is a disgrace and is becoming a national embarrassment.’ Another passenger mocked the airport, posting: ‘Well done Heathrow airport. I’ve spent longer in thus immigration queue than in the air.’ The computer glitch is the latest humiliation for the Home . Office’s beleaguered UK Border Force - and the biggest disaster since the widespread queue chaos before the 2012 Olympics.

"By . Steph Cockroft . Life might begin at 40 - but it seems those aged over 45 are the ones who really enjoy themselves. According to a new survey, those in the middle-aged category are the happiest people in Britain. In a survey of more than 2,000 adults, those over 45 - dubbed by researchers as the mid-life risers - came out on top, in part due to strong relationships with family and friends. Those aged over 45 are the happiest in Britain, mainly due to the strong relationships they have with family and friends, a survey has found (stock pic) Researchers from dating service Love Begins At found that 60 per cent of those in that age range felt content - and 83 per cent said they had strong relationships with family and friends. The study asked adults to rate how they felt across different areas, based on the five elements for happiness devised by pyschiatrist Carl Jung. And it found that those who have lived for more than four decades were the happiest generation. Researchers . at Love Begins At and YouGov have now dubbed this age group as the 'mid-life risers' because they say it is the 'new aspiration generation'. The categories on which the adults were questioned included good physical and mental health, good personal and intimate relationships and good standard of living and satisfactory work. They were also asked about their appreciation of art, nature and world events, as well as the ability to cope with the ups and down of life. More than 60 per cent of those aged over 45 questioned in the survey said they felt content with life (stock pic) Those aged over 45 came out top in three of the five categories, with 83 per cent feeling they had a strong network of friends and family. This was compared to 73 per cent of those in the 25-44 age group. Knowledge, education and understanding of world news and issues was also felt more strongly by those in the older category. Just over 75 per cent said they felt content with their knowledge, compared with 72 per cent of those aged between 25 - 44. A separate study conducted with YouGov also showed 43 per cent of men aged over 55 felt their life had got better since turning 45. Samantha . Bedford, from Love Begins At, said: 'It’s great to look forward to . life ahead with excitement – with the confidence and wherewithal to make . the most of the opportunities available. 'These mid-life risers are not about fading into grey. It’s about moving into a . new stage of life, post-children and preparing to try something new. These over 45s are often moving into a new stage of their romantic life too. 'Independent, . confident and content looking, they’re no longer looking for the mother . or father of their children but for a partner to enjoy life with.'","Survey finds 'mid-life risers' aged over 45 are the happiest in Britain .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana have each been sentenced to 18-month jail terms for tax evasion charges - despite the prosecution arguing for the pair to be acquitted. Italy's appeals court upheld a verdict issued last June against the pair on charges of using Luxembourg holding company Gado to avoid paying taxes on royalties of about 1billion euros (£820million). In court yesterday, the pair were each given suspended sentences of 18 months in jail  - reduced from 20 months because of statute of limitations applied to certain facts in the case. Italian fashion designers Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce were given an 18month jail sentence yesterday for tax evasion on royalties of up to 1billion euros. The pair are set to appeal the decision . The designers - who have always denied any wrongdoing - said they would appeal the decision. Lawyer Massimo Dinoia said: 'I am speechless. We are all shocked. The judgement is inexplicable and we will appeal. 'The prosecutor himself asked for them to be cleared.' The Milan prosecutor had asked the court back in March to clear the pair, who - in a protest last year at being 'pilloried' - closed their Milan stores. The previous decision, by a lower court, handed the duo suspended jail sentences of 20 months each. A fine of up to 10 million euros was also imposed over avoidance of the payments in Italy, where corporate taxes are among the highest in Europe. The case stems from an investigation that began in 2008 when Italian tax authorities stepped up their fight against tax evasion as a global financial crisis began to bite. President of the second section of the appeal court Laura Cairati, center, reads the fashion designers's sentence in court yesterday . The pair, pictured with Kylie Minogue, were first charged with tax evasion last June - but the Italian appeals court upheld the decision yesterday. Their sentence was reduced from 20 to 18 months . Fashion companies have fallen under the scrutiny of Italy's tax authorities partly due to the fact the sector has performed well during the country's longest recession since World War Two. 'Luxury is one of the few sectors to have done well in recent years,' said a partner specialising in tax at Grant Thornton in Milan who declined to be named. 'It is easier to go and ask for money where there is money as opposed to going to a troubled sector.' The cases rarely come to court, however. Giorgio Armani paid 270 million euros to tax authorities in early April to settle a dispute over payments from the group's subsidiaries abroad. Prada Holding, which controls Prada, paid a reported 400-420 million euros to settle taxes in Italy after completing a process of voluntary disclosure in December.","Italian fashion designers first charged with tax avoidance last June .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A teenage chef who claims she suffered sexual discrimination at a celebrity-owned restaurant turned up to work in 'skimpy tops and hot pants', a tribunal heard today. Chloe Maisey, 19, who has made 21 allegations against the all-male staff at the Hardwick restaurant in Abergavenny, also used 'sexually provocative' language at work, it was claimed. Miss Maisey worked at the restaurant - which is owned by Gordon Ramsey's best man Stephen Terry - as trainee pastry chef for three months, but claims she was ogled at every day as she got changed into her chef's whites. Chloe Maisey, 19, left, alleges she was sexually discriminated at the Hardwick restaurant in Abergavenny, which is owned by Stephen Terry, right, a celebrity chef who often features on cooking programmes . But on the third day of the employment tribunal in Cardiff, staff members told how Miss Maisey, of Pontyclun, south Wales, turned up to work in 'skimpy tops and hot pants' which were 'inappropriate' for the workplace. Sous chef Jamie O’Leary, 32, said: 'I didn’t find her clothes fit for the workplace. I thought some of the clothes she showed up in were inappropriate for work.' William Rees, who is representing Miss Maisey, suggested to Mr O'Leary that staff had sexually discriminated the chef because they thought she was 'cheap'. But Mr O’Leary replied: 'My wife wears skimpy tops and hot pants and I don’t think she is cheap - but she doesn’t wear them to work.' The tribunal also heard how Miss Maisey was 'not shy' about showing off her tattoos and piercings. Miss Maisey, who is pregnant, has a tattoo of a laced . stocking top with an antique pistol tucked into it around the top of her . right thigh, the hearing was told. The Hardwick restaurant  near  Abergavenny - often tipped as the best in Wales - where Miss Maisey claims the all-male stuff sexually discriminated her . Former chef Andrew Fellowes said: 'She would show people her tattoos and show off her piercings.'She instigated that. I didn’t care about piercings and tattoos - I came to work to cook. 'I suppose you do judge someone if they dress like that for work but it still didn’t affect the way I treated her at work.' But Miss Maisey also claims she was 'groped' by a member of staff who slapped her bottom. She said her colleagues often teased her about her breasts. She claims she was targetted because she was the only girl in the kitchen. Yesterday's hearing also heard how the young chef was shut in a freezer one day at work, leaving her 'scared and upset'. The trainee pastry chef, who worked at the restaurant for three months, wore 'skimpy tops and hot pants' to work, which some described in the tribunal as 'inappropriate' Staff also put salt and pepper in her hair and earwigs in her saucepan to scare her, the tribunal was told. But Mr Terry, 47, who trained under Marco Pierre White and often features on cooking programmes, told the tribunal that some of the incidents never happened and dismissed the others as 'banter'. He said: 'Doing service is very stressful and there is a little bit of banter. 'You are in an environment where people mess about on occasions, but the guys are not malicious in any way. It is not that she was singled out because of her sex.' He denied being involved in any of the play himself saying 'I am above that'. The . tribunal also heard on previous days how the vegetarian teenager was tricked into eating . beef stock by a colleague who told her it was chocolate sauce. Mr Terry, who owns the restaurant, said he considered some of the behaviour towards Miss Maisey as 'banter' Mr Terry - who was awarded a Michelin star at the age of 25 - did not deny the incident happened, but told the tribunal he took vegetarians 'very seriously'. He also said he was 'shocked to the core' when Miss Maisey’s mother rang him to complain about her daughter’s treatment. But Mr Rees told Mr Terry he had failed to investigate the allegations formally and took the word of his male employees after one conversation. Mr Terry, who denies the allegations, said he trusted his senior chefs who had worked for him over a number of years. There were also allegations from Miss Maisie that Mr O'Leary threw a sea bass at her. Mr O'Leary, told the tribunal: 'Have you any idea how much sea bass costs?' 'If Stephen Terry caught wind of me throwing a sea bass around the kitchen it would be the end of me.' The tribunal continues.

Dressed in full suit and tie, these gentleman are hardly breaking a sweat as they 'exercise' on equipment from the 1800s. And rather getting their pulses racing by doing some serious time on the cross trainer, these 'athletes' don't appear to be doing very much of anything at all.

The vintage contraptions are believed to . be early frontrunners of modern gym equipment such as the treadmill, . exercise bike and bench press.

The images were published by Zander at his fitness institute in London’s Soho Square in 1883. A young male pulls his own body weight using two pulleys attached to his seat . Another posture machine, which was one of 70 created by the doctor, was thought to help the user straighten the user's spine . The manual pictured men and women using the machines, which he described as 'a preventative against the evils engendered by a sedentary life and the seclusion of the office'. The equipment was fitted with a complicated set of pulleys and counter balances designed to exercise muscles and fight the flab. Later exercise equipment doesn't appear to be a great deal better.

"By . Damien Gayle . Dominique Strauss-Kahn is suing a pimp for opening a brothel bearing the initials DSK, the disgraced former IMF chief's widely used nickname. Dominique Alderweireld, aka 'Dodo la Saumure', is set to open the 'Dodo Sex Klub' in the town of Blaton in Belgium, where prostitution and owning brothels are legal. The French-born pimp has already been linked to alleged orgies attended by Strauss-Kahn, whose public profile was ruined by a sex scandal involving a hotel maid in New York City. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Disgraced former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn leaving a Paris courthouse in February after attending a hearing regarding his seizure request of a book by a alleged former lover detailing their liaisons . Strauss-Kahn's lawyers said they were suing Alderweireld, 64, for deliberately choosing a name that 'reproduces his (Strauss-Kahn's) initials which identify him to all.' A former potential presidential candidate in France, Strauss-Kahn is well known by his initials DSK there and in neighbouring French-speaking countries such as Belgium and Switzerland. Dodo la Saumure, who is currently facing charges in France of aggravated pimping and supplying prostitutes to Strauss-Kahn, was not immediately available for comment. But he had earlier told AFP that the name was a good publicity stunt. He said the name of the establishment, which will be staffed by 'seven girls, of whom one is a transsexual' was 'commercially brilliant... as everybody talks about DSK.' Strauss-Kahn was forced to resign as head of the International Monetary Fund following his 2011 arrest for an alleged sexual assault on a New York hotel maid. Belgian-based pimp Dominique Alderweireld, pictured left, is being sued by the former International Monetary Fund Chief Dominique Strauss Kahn, after the club owner named his new venue DSKlub, pictured . Criminal charges in the case were dropped and at the end of 2012, Strauss-Kahn settled a civil suit brought by the maid by paying her undisclosed damages, which reportedly exceeded $1.5million. Alderweireld has said he plans to open another sex establishment in Belgium called the Carlton, the name of a posh hotel in the northern French city of Lille where Strauss-Kahn attended sex parties. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers insist he had no idea the women taking part in the parties were prostitutes. But prosecutors say he was central to the organisation of what amounted to orgies. Last August, a French judge sent Strauss-Kahn and 12 others - including Alderweireld - for trial on charges of aggravated pimping as part of an organised gang. Alderweireld also denies the charges. A ruling is expected sometime this year. Saumure, meaning brine, is the salt oil that fish in this part of Europe are often served in, especially mackerel, the French slang for pimp.","Pimp called Dodo la Saumure is set to open the 'Dodo Sex Klub' in Belgium .

"By . Julian Robinson . Cowboy builder Danny Shea, pictured, conned home-owners out of more than £2million by failing to complete work on their properties, including leaving one a roofless shell . A cowboy builder conned home-owners out of more than £2million by failing to complete work on their properties, including leaving one a roofless shell. Danny Shea removed the roof of one bungalow and left it an uninhabitable shell, but never completed the work, leaving the couple living in a caravan in the garden. Now the 48-year-old is behind bars after he was handed a five and a half year jail term for his crimes. Shea, of Bordon, Hampshire, was sentenced at Winchester Crown Court after pleading guilty to nine fraud charges and one of fraudulent trading. The offences involved homes in the Thursley, Chiddingfold, Tadworth and Chertsey areas of Surrey and Farnborough, Bordon and Grayshott in Hampshire, between 2007 and 2010. The South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (Serocu), which investigated Shea, found that the 48-year-old had carried out renovations and rebuilding worth £2.1 million which was not completed. Victims Martin Wells and his wife lost about £150,000 in payments to Shea, whom they employed to renovate their bungalow in Grayshott. Mr Wells said Shea ripped off the roof of his property but never returned to finish the job leaving him and his wife to live in a caravan through two winters,' Mr Wells told the BBC. 'As the weeks went by, there was not much work being done, no materials were arriving on site. 'I would be on the phone to Shea every day, sometimes several times a day. ""When is the timber arriving? When are the bricks arriving?"" He would always have a very plausible excuse . 'We were stuck in the caravan with a house with no roof on it. 'We were stupid to the extent that we gave him money. We probably lost £150,000 but we got to a stage where we had to believe this was going to happen.' Detective Sergeant Ian Ball said: 'For three years Shea systematically defrauded customers who engaged him to carry out building work. 'He claimed to be going to carry out work to a proper standard and finish the respective jobs. ' 'In fact he had no intention of doing either. After an original down-payment, he would obtain further money, again with no intention of doing the work properly or sometimes at all. The bungalow owned by Martin Wells in Grayshott, Hampshire, before work was started on the roof by cowboy builder Danny Shea. And this was the state of the Wells' bungalow after Danny Shea had failed to finish the job having removed the roof. The couple were forced to live in a caravan in the garden through two winters and lost tens of thousands of pounds . 'He would provide an initial quote, followed by a request for money upfront for labour and materials. 'He would provide references from customers satisfied with early work on their projects and suggested extra work which could be carried out. 'Further requests for payment would be made but work would slow and stop. There would be re-negotiation but by then the victims were sucked in and just wanted to have the work finished so would agree to the new demands and even pay suppliers direct for materials. 'Shea would meanwhile make token efforts at work just to keep them on the hook. Then he would disappear, leaving unfinished and sub-standard work. 'The cost of remedial work sometimes ran into hundreds of thousands of pounds. 'However, working with partners in many agencies and with the CPS, we were able to support the victims and get the evidence that finally enabled us to bring Shea to justice after an investigation that has now spanned three years.' The fraudulent trading related to theft of plant and construction machinery and motor vehicles, which had been unlawfully sold.

"By . Damien Gayle . Abu Hamza saw violence as necessary to defend Muslims and saw physical training for jihad as an obligation for all Muslim men, a court heard on Wednesday. James Ujaama, a U.S.-based associate of Hamza, told jurors in the New York court that the Islamist cleric had instructed him to set up a jihadist training camp in the U.S. U.S. prosecutors hope Ujaama's testimony will convince a federal jury that the preacher is guilty of trying to set up the camp to aid al Qaeda. The charges against him carry a potential life sentence. Facing life in jail: Islamist cleric Abu Hamza pictured in a court sketch at the Federal Court in Lower Manhattan, New York, where he is on trial for allegedly setting up terrorist training camps in the U.S. One-eyed, handless Hamza, 56, is also accused of supporting al Qaeda in Afghanistan and of providing assistance to militants who kidnapped 16 Western tourists in Yemen in 1998. Four of the hostages were killed during a rescue operation. Hamza's lawyers have argued that he used inflammatory rhetoric but did not commit any crimes. The court saw a copy of a fax that Ujaama sent to Hamza, then a preacher at London's Finsbury Park mosque, telling him about a ranch in Oregon where he hoped to set up the training camp. 'The land that we spoke of is about 160 acres and looks just like Afghanistan,' Ujaama said in the fax. He added that Oregon was a 'pro-militia and firearms state' where it would be easy to stockpile weapons for combat training. Ujaama, who pleaded guilty in 2003 to conspiring to aid the Taliban, appeared as part of a cooperation deal with prosecutors and is expected to remain on the witness stand for several days. As a former associate of Hamza, Ujaama is a key government witness. His testimony is expected to cover not only Oregon but the allegation that Abu Hamza sent a man to Afghanistan to receive military training with al Qaeda. Hamza with a masked bodyguard, outside the closed Finsbury Park Mosque: Government witness James Ujaama met with Hamza at the mosque soon after the American returned from training in Afghanistan . Ujaama said he first met the fiery preacher in London in 1998, shortly after returning from a trip to Afghanistan where he attended training camps with religious extremists. The two men discussed Islamic teachings over tea and cookies at Abu Hamza's second-floor office at the Finsbury Park mosque, Ujaama said. 'I walked away from that meeting very impressed with Sheikh Abu Hamza,' Ujaama was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. Soon after, Ujaama was working for Abu Hamza, writing and publishing articles online for an organization called Supporters of Sharia run by the preacher. One piece - titled 'A Declaration of War' - summarised Osama bin Laden's call to take up arms against the U.S., Ujaama said. 'Was Abu Hamza overseeing you when you posted this statement?' asked Assistant U.S. Attorney John Cronan. 'Yes, he was,' Ujaama replied. Police outside Finsbury Park mosque after a raid: Ujaama told the court that he and Hamza discussed Islamic teachings over tea and cookies in a second-floor office there and he then began working for the preacher . In 1999, Ujaama said, the two men arrived in Oregon from the United Kingdom and were disappointed to find that Ujaama's camp did not have many weapons or recruits. Ujaama said he was threatened by one of the men, Oussama Kassir, who claimed to be a former bodyguard for Osama bin Laden. In the coming days, Ujaama is also expected to testify that Abu Hamza ordered him in 2000 to take another man, Feroz Abbasi, to Afghanistan to seek out training with al Qaeda. Egyptian-born Hamza lost his hands and one eye in Afghanistan in the 1980s. A British court convicted him 2006 of inciting followers to violence and he served six years in prison before his extradition to the U.S. in 2012.","James Ujaama tells Federal court that Hamza asked him to set up the camp .

A jealous student who used a kitchen knife to 'saw' a seven centimetre gash into his ex-girlfriend's neck after she ended their love affair was today jailed. Gary Davies, 26, locked Robyn Clegg-Gibson, 19, in her bedroom at halls in Lancaster University, where he set about giving her 'something to remember'. He only stopped the attack when a police officer broke down the door to witness the bloody scene as Davies sliced through his former lover's neck. Miss Clegg-Gibson survived the ordeal but has been left suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and anxiety. Davies was sentenced to eight years in prison at Preston Crown Court today after denying attempted murder but admitting wounding with intent and false imprisonment. The court heard that he had attacked the teenager in the early hours of September 30 last year after she ended their two-month relationship during an argument on a night out. After returning to Miss Clegg-Gibson’s home at Lancaster University, where the pair both studied, Davies dealt five blows with a serrated kitchen knife because he 'wanted to leave a scar', the court was told. Giving evidence at a three-day trial, Davies, who was described as a 'demanding' boyfriend, said he had originally picked up a pair of scissors to scare her after becoming 'angry and upset'. 'I wanted to scare her but I didn’t think scissors were intimidating enough, then I saw the knife in the drawer,' he said. 'I wanted to give her something to remember not to mess with me. 'I was losing face as I saw it with her and her friends. 'The argument was trivial but it was still on my mind. I was worked up. 'I started thinking she was going to get away with this but I’m going to get in trouble. 'I was angry and upset and I wanted to leave a scar. 'I wanted to give her something to remember every time she looks in the mirror. 'I was just stabbing everywhere.' Ordeal: Robyn Clegg-Gibson, 19, was left with a seven centimetre gash across her neck after the attack last September. She has been left suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and anxiety . 'Curled up in a ball on the floor bleeding': Miss Clegg-Davies was only rescued when a policeman broke in to the room to witness the bloody scene as Davies sliced through his former lover's neck with the kitchen knife . Following the break-up, Davies was let into the house to look for his keys, which he claimed he had lost during the night out. He was asked to leave 'countless times' after Miss Clegg-Gibson became uncomfortable with him in her bedroom - but he refused. As she phoned the police, Davies went . into the kitchen and grabbed a knife, before returning to her bedroom . and locking the door behind him. Davies attacked the teenager in the early hours of last September 30 after she ended their relationship. He denied attempted murder, telling the court, 'I wanted to give her something to remember not to mess with me' Threatening Miss Clegg-Gibson with the knife, he told her to ring the police again and tell them not to come to the address. But a few minutes later, a police officer arrived outside and asked Davies to open the door, causing him to panic. During the trial, Paul Cummings, prosecuting, said: 'He climbed on top of her and started to saw at her neck. She had her hand up and was trying to stop him. 'She was curled up in a ball on the floor bleeding and could feel the knife on her throat.' Davies, who was also in his first year at university but lived in different student accommodation, was stopped when the police officer kicked down the door.

"By . Associated Press . Authorities were evacuating numerous buildings Wednesday afternoon after several CSX tanker cars carrying crude oil derailed in downtown Lynchburg, Vriginia., and caught fire along the James River, city officials said. The city of Lynchburg on its website posted that the fire department was on the scene and urged motorists and pedestrians to avoid the area. It tweeted that the tanker cars were carrying crude oil and that three or four of them were breached. The city said 13 or 14 tanker cars were involved in the derailment. No injuries were immediately reported, the city said. Scroll down for video... Blast: Deveral CSX tanker cars carrying crude oil in burst into flames after derailing in downtown Lynchburg, Virginia . Alight: Between 12 and 14 cars from a CSX freight train were involved in the derailment, which occurred along the James River and left oil burning along the river's surface . Fiery: Authorities were evacuating numerous buildings Wednesday afternoon after several CSX tanker cars carrying crude oil derailed in downtown Lynchburg, Va., and caught fire along the James River, city officials said . City officials instructed motorists and pedestrians to stay away from downtown, while firefighters battled the blaze. Three railcars were still on fire as of 4 p.m . Witnesses say the smoke and fire were on a long stretch of the train tracks. The smaller fires died down pretty quickly . Photos and video show several black tanker cars derailed and extensive flames and smoke. The city said on in a news release on its website that CSX officials were working to remove the portion of the train that is blocking workers from leaving Griffin Pipe Foundry located in the lower basin. 'We're used to kind of bangs and booms,' said Gerald McComas, a security officer at foundry up river from the derailment site. 'My first thought was it sounded like one of the guys started a motorcycle and then a realized, wait a minute, no ... that was more of a boom. We walked outside and there was the smoke rolling in.' Concerns: Several trains carrying crude oil have derailed over the past year, prompting critics to question the safety of hauling explosive liquids by rail. Last July, a runaway train in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, derailed and exploded, killing 47 people . The fiery derailment occurred a short distance from office buildings in downtown Lynchburg, a city of 77,000 . Safety first: Lynchburg's drinking water wasn't affected by the spill. But in Richmond, more than 100 miles downriver, authorities have begun drawing drinking water out of a separate canal rather than the James as a precautionary measure . Smoking: People look on as smoke rises after several CSX tanker cars carrying crude oil derailed on Wednesday in Lynchburg, Virginia . People in the general area have been evacuated, and the City of Lynchburg is asking people to avoid downtown . A portion of the train was blocking the road allowing workers at to leave their parking lot, McComas said. Instead workers were walking along the tracks to get to the other side of the train in order to leave their facility. 'I'm walking home tonight,' McComas joked. A phone message left by The Associated Press with the Lynchburg Police Department wasn't immediately returned. Gov. Terry McAuliffe said Deputy Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Adam Thiel was dispatched to the site to provide officials with updates on the situation. Lynchburg is a city of about 77,000 people in the foothills of Blue Ridge Mountains. It is home to Liberty University and several others and is located about halfway between Baltimore and Charlotte, North Carolina. Getting out:  Authorities evacuated numerous buildings Wednesday after the derailment . The CSX train was carrying between 12 and 14 CSX tanker cars when it derailed around 1:45 p.m. Oil train accidents were the topic of National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Deborah Hersman last week at a two-day safety forum in Washington. Hersman said the Obama administration needed to take steps immediately to protect the public from potentially catastrophic oil train accidents even if it means using emergency authority. The Transportation Department was in the midst of drafting regulations to toughen standards for tank cars used to transport oil and ethanol, as well as other steps prevent or mitigate accidents. But there isn't time to wait for the cumbersome federal rulemaking process â€” which often takes many years to complete â€” to run its normal course, Hersman said. 'We are very clear that this issue needs to be acted on very quickly,' she told reporters at the conclusion of a two-day forum the board held on the rail transport of oil and ethanol. 'There is a very high risk here that hasn't been addressed.'","No injuries have been reported from the derailment in downtown Lynchburg .

An estate agent in Wales has whipped up a treat for those in the market for a new house - the former summer home of the family behind the Bird's custard empire, which has gone up for sale for £595,000. Villagers can remember the eccentric Bird family arriving at the country house in a fleet of custard yellow Rolls Royces. The Birds used the property in the Welsh hills as a fishing and hunting lodge during the summer months. And more than 100 years later it is being advertised as perfect holiday home for anyone who wants to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. The house was built with the vast fortune the family made from the housewife's favourite custard powder which is egg-free. It was invented in Birmingham by chemist Sir Alfred Bird in 1837 because his wife was allergic to eggs. The Birds built Plas Tanat, near Welshpool, Mid Wales, to join the wealthy Victorian set on weekend hunting and shooting parties. Sir Alfred and other wealthy businessmen set up the local fishing club on the River Tanat and Rhaeadr. Plas Tanat - Tanat Place in English - still has its own fishing rights which come with the asking price of £595,000. House about that: The summer home of the family behind the Bird's custard empire is up for sale and is positioned right next to a river in Wales . Country living: The five-bedroomed house is near Welshpool, in mid Wales, and comes with its own fishing rights . Rural idyll: The house stayed in the Bird family until 1970 when it was sold to a local buyer . To the manor lawn: The house comes with a beautifully landscaped garden . Keen: Estate agent Victoria Pocock said there has been a lot of interest in the property, describing it as a 'gem, with a fascinating history' Grand: The new owners will enjoy a wood-panelled living room - but sadly the furniture isn't part of the deal . Llife on the wild side: The Bird family mainly used the house as a fishing and hunting lodge . Food for thought: The kitchen is more than ample in size, with plenty of room to whip up some Bird's custard . Dream property: The country air will definitely help with a good night's sleep - and so will the spacious and comfy bedrooms . Quaint: The estate agent said that there are 'arts and crafts influences running through the house' Stately: Even the bathroom features angled timber work . Water sight: A wooden walkway crosses the river from the house's front garden . Relaxing retreat: The house is set in gloriously tranquil countryside . Gill-seekers: Sir Alfred Bird set up a fishing club nearby and little wonder, as the river is perfect for peaceful angling . Sight to behold: The mansion is one of the grandest houses in the area . The benevolent Birds also donated money towards the building of the village hall in 1926, and gave a cottage to their gardener as a thank you for his hard work . Clever: Bird's Custard was invented in 1837 - by Sir Alfred Bird . Bird's Custard was invented way back in 1837 in Birmingham by Sir Alfred Bird, who was egged on by the fact that his wife was allergic to eggs - which has always traditionally been one of the product's key ingredients, used to help thicken it. Mr Bird used cornflour instead of egg to create an imitation of custard. It was originally intended only for his wife. It was only when the custard was accidentally fed to guests that Mr Bird realised that his invention had a wider use. Soon afterwards he founded Alfred Bird and Sons Ltd, which would go on to become the famous Bird’s Custard company and brand. Bird was not content to revolutionise custard but went on to invent baking powder - he formulated it in 1843 so he could make yeast-free bread for his wife. By 1844 the company, which had a factory in Digbeth, Birmingham, was promoting custard powder nationally and making baking powder, too. Alfred Bird died on December 15 1878 and is buried at Key Hill Cemetery in Birmingham. Famously his obituary in the journal of the Chemical Society, of which he was a fellow, discussed at length his skills and research but did not mention his other activity – the by then famous Bird’s Custard. His son, Alfred Frederick Bird, continued the work of his father. Bird junior went on to invent egg substitute powder in 1890, blancmange powder and jelly powder. Captain Scott took Bird’s products on his ill-fated Antarctic expedition in 1912 and in World War I, Bird's Custard was supplied to the British armed forces. The company was one of the early users of promotional items and colourful advertising campaigns. The famous 'three bird' logo, however, was relatively late in arriving, only introduced in 1929. World War II saw rationing and serious . production limits. Shortly after the war, Bird's was purchased by the . General Foods Corporation, which was itself taken over by Phillip Morris . in the 1980s and merged into Kraft Foods. Although the Bird's Custard . product remains, the company itself is now just a brand. Production was relocated to Banbury in 1964, along with the factory gates, featuring the company logo. In 1981, a dust explosion occurred at the Banbury factory when corn starch powder mixed with air, forming an explosive mixture which blew out one of the factory walls. In late 2004, . Kraft sold Bird's Custard and some other brands to Premier Foods, who . now produce the Brand at their Knighton site in Staffordshire. A food and drink survey carried out in 2000 found 99 per cent of customers recognised the brand, which accounts for 45 per cent of the custard consumed in the UK. Bird's Custard is also exported to several countries around the world, including the United States, where it is popular among several ethnic groups. In 2012 Bird’s sold 108million pints of custard (as consumed), which equates to 21 Olympic sized swimming pools. The original Custard factory in Digbeth is now a centre providing space to artists.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Former Tory MP Patrick Mercer said he was 'ashamed' as he announced he was to quit Parliament . The cash-for-questions scandal which forced Patrick Mercer to quit the Commons was the worst the Commons watchdog had seen, it emerged today. The ex-Tory minister was accused of using his position in parliament ‘for his own gain’ after agreeing to take money in return for tabling questions in Parliament the Commons. He quit his Newark seat in disgrace on Tuesday, ahead of today’s report which also criticised him for using ‘racially offensive language’. Mr Mercer, a former army officer, dramatically ended his political career by quitting the Commons after learning he was to be suspended for six months. He resigned from the Tory party in July after he was exposed as having accepted £4,000 to ask Parliamentary questions and lobby on behalf of Fiji. He referred himself to Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and promised to quit the Commons at the next election. But it emerged that the standards watchdog was to recommend he be kicked out for six months, and he resigned on Tuesday night. The report said Mr Mercer ‘deliberately evaded’ rules and ‘inflicted significant reputational damage’ on Parliament. The suspension the Standards Committee had planned to impose on the former Army colonel would have been the longest it had meted out to an MP since 1947, with the exception former Labour MP Denis MacShane, who was convicted of criminal offences. Its report stated: ‘We are not aware of a case relating to a sitting MP which has involved such a sustained and pervasive breach of the House's rules on registration, declaration and paid advocacy.’ The by-election sparked by his decision to quit the Nottinghamshire seat will be held on June 5. Ukip leader Nigel Farage yesterday ruled out standing in the seat himself, claiming he wanted to focus on the European Parliament elections on May 22. The damning report said Mr Mercer, a former Tory minister, had used his position in parliament 'for his own gain' The investigation found Mr Mercer was ‘willing to use his parliamentary position for his own gain’ and readily signed an agreement for consultancy services but failed to register it or declare his interest when tabling relevant parliamentary questions. Mr Mercer was also criticised for using ‘racially offensive language’ in relation to footage that showed him talking about a visit to Israel where he told an 18-year-old girl ‘you look like a bloody Jew’. When he was asked about the incident during the investigation, Mr Mercer said he had been ‘very tired at the time’ and admitted it had been a ‘stupid thing to say’, the report said. Mr Mercer had added: ‘I am married to a woman of Jewish extraction. I have lots of friends in the Jewish community, and, yes, I can prostrate myself no further, it's just a stupid thing to say, and I didn't even... I accept I said it, and I am conscious that my speech isn't always as balanced as it should be.’ The committee said it had come to the conclusion that Mr Mercer's dealings with the fake public affairs consultants ‘were motivated by the desire for commercial gain’. Its report adds: ‘We agree with the commissioner's conclusion that, in allowing payment to influence his actions in parliamentary proceedings, in failing to declare his interests on appropriate occasions, in failing to recognise that his actions were not in accordance with his expressed views on acceptable behaviour, in repeatedly denigrating fellow members both individually and collectively, and in using racially offensive language, Mr Mercer inflicted significant reputational damage on the House and its members.’","Former minister quit the Commons on Tuesday ahead of today's report .

Pete Thurlow, 42, had travelled to Burnham-on-Sea just one day before the crash to lay flowers at the scene where his nephew Dylan died, on what would have been the young boy's sixth birthday . Speaking on her son Dylanâ€™s Facebook memorial page, Miss McCollum confirmed the news that Dylan's uncle had been killed. She said: 'Dylan as you know me daddy aunty lisa and uncle pete came to burnham to lay you flowers for your 6th birthday. 'Only 50mins after midnight your uncle pete was tragicly [sic] killed on the motorway in burnham. 'Please take care of each other up their [sic] fly high. Love you both to the moon and back xxxxx.' Mr Thurlow, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, made the 170-mile journey to . lay flowers for Dylan on what would have been the young boy's sixth birthday. He travelled to the Somerset town where the tragedy took place, with his . wife Lisa, as well as Dylan's parents Rachel McCollum and Darren Cecil, on Tuesday. Little Dylan Cecil drowned in August 2012 after falling from a jetty while on holiday with his family. His mother and father both jumped in to try and save their son but he was swept away by strong currents . Emergency services at the scene of the crash on the M5, between Burnham-on-Sea and Weston-Super-Mare, in which Dylan's uncle died yesterday . But while he was returning home, he was involved in the crash, which took place between Weston-Super-Mare and Burnham-on-Sea, and was killed. A police spokesman confirmed Mr Thurlow had been killed in the crash but said they were not yet sure of the circumstances. The tragedy is the second to hit the . family in as many years. Dylan Cecil drowned on August 19, 2012 after . falling the jetty into Bridgwater Bay, Somerset, while . visiting his grandmother, Jackie McCollum. The family had been going for a stroll at 6pm in the evening when the tragedy unfolded. Dylan's mother, pictured at the slipway in Burnham-on-Sea near where Dylan died, travelled with Dylan's dad Darren Cecil and his uncle and auntie to lay flowers to commemorate the young boy's sixth birthday . An inquest into his death heard how Dylan lost his footing while playing with his two younger sisters. His mother tried in vain to save her four-year-old son, leaping into the water with Dylan's father, Darren. But the young boy had been carried away by strong currents. Dylan's father Darren, front right, seen at his son's funeral. Dylan died after slipping into the sea while going on a family walk . The tides at Burnham-on-Sea are believed to be some of the highest and most powerful in the world. It was estimated that the speed of the current on the day was around four or five knots, approximately 5mph, strong enough to easily sweep an adult off their feet. Four days later, after an extensive search involving RNLI and the local Burnham Area Rescue Boat, Dylanâ€™s body was discovered. Speaking about the crash in which Mr Thurlow died, a police spokesman said: 'He was among a group of people from Kettering who had been attending a memorial service in Burnham-on-Sea. It is all in connection with the young boy who tragically drowned.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A curious toddler who climbed a chest of drawers because he wanted to reach his toys was crushed to death in a 'horrific' accident, an inquest has heard. Mason Tipping, aged 22 months, who was described by his devastated parents as being 'full of life', started climbing up the drawers at his home in Colchester, Essex when he was unable to reach a toy. But the drawers, which weighed more than three-and-a-half stone, toppled over and crushed the little boy to death. Mason Tipping, who was 22 months, was crushed to death after a chest of drawers on which he had tried to climb fell on top of him . At an inquest into Mason's death, the court heard how his parents had screwed the bottom two drawers shut to stop their son from using them as steps. But, tragically, their bid to make the drawers safer made the furniture top-heavy. Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said the Mason's death, which took place in December 2012, was a 'tragic' accident. She said: 'Really, the chest of drawers was a bit top-heavy. 'It was a horrific, tragic accident. He was a much-loved little boy with probably a bright future in front of him.' The inquest was told how Mason's mother Christine Tauchert, 42, raced into the room when she heard her daughter crying. Mason Tipping, front, pictured with his parents Adrian and Christine and his two sisters, Keira and baby Faye. The inquest heard Mason died as a result of a 'horrific, tragic accident' After seeing her son beneath the drawers, she shouted for Mason's father, Adrian Tipping, to come and lift the furniture off him. But despite Mr Tipping's efforts to give his son first aid, Mason died shortly afterwards at Colchester General Hospital. The cause of death was given as 'positional asphyxia'. Mason's parents, who have two other children, Keira and Faye, have . previously warned other parents about the hidden and unexpected . dangers which can be lurking through the home. Mason, left, was described as 'full of life' by his parents, left. His father Adrian tried to give Mason first aid after he was found under the drawers by his mother Christine, but Mason later died in hospital . After the accident, Mr Tipping said: 'I hope no-one else has to go through this and I hope parents . will take the time just to attach cabinets to walls. 'For . the sake of a bracket that will cost a few quid, it could make all the . difference as we don't want anyone else to have to go through this.' Detective Constable Lee Pollard told the inquest he went to the couple's flat on November 9, 2012 as part of routine inquiries following a death. Mason's parents had screwed the bottom two drawers together to stop their curious son using them as steps, which made the chest of drawers top heavy . He said there was no evidence of anything suspicious surrounding Mason's death. He said: 'It was explained to me that Mason had previously tried to climb the drawers in order to get to the toys. 'The bottom two drawers were shut, leaving access to the top three drawers which contained clothing.' Mr Tipping, 31, paid tribute to their son after the accident, saying : 'Mason was so full of . life, he was always climbing and nothing would faze him. 'That's why the drawers had been fastened shut. It keeps running through my mind that what I did caused the drawers to fall.' Speaking after the inquest, he added: 'We are happy with the outcome. We could not have expected anything else.' His mother, who is a carer, said: 'I had taken Mason to baby massage classes and he had joined the local group for toddlers. I did everything I could to spend time with him. He was a gentle giant.'","Mason Tipping, who was 22 months, died at his home in Colchester, Essex .

"By . Bianca London . We're a nation that runs on tea drinking, but what would you sacrifice for a cuppa? New research has revealed how our love of tea is so great that one fifth (19 per cent) of women would rather go without sex than give up tea. Over a third (35 per cent) of those polled would go without Facebook, and a quarter would forego alcohol (28 per cent) or chocolate (25 per cent) - all in favour of a good brew. Tea lovers: Miranda Kerr is a notorious tea lover and even designed her own range of china but would she, like one fifth of women, rather go without sex than give up tea? We're also a fussy bunch when it comes to making it: 48 per cent of Brits prefer to make a cup of tea themselves, rather than trust someone else to make it because, they say, it just doesn’t taste the same. Results were even higher amongst the 55-plus age group, with the majority (52 per cent) of respondents saying they prefer to make their own brew. If you are going to accept an offer of a cuppa, think twice before taking one from a man, as 14 per cent admit to giving someone a brew in a dirty mug. Men’s slapdash approach might be due to less practice, as the average woman makes five cups of tea a day, versus the four made by the average man. That’s 1,825 cups of tea made by the average woman each year, compared to 1,460 made by men. We really do love tea! A fifth of women would sacrifice sex for a cup of tea, over a third would go without Facebook, and a quarter would forego alcohol . While we'll use almost any excuse to have a cup of tea, there are rules that every tea-maker must abide by. Nearly half (48 per cent) of Brits think that leaving used tea bags on the kitchen worktop is the biggest tea-making no-no, although 14 per cent  of people admit to doing so. Leaving the tea bag in the cup goes against tea making etiquette for almost half (44 per cent) of Brits, and serving tea with the remnants of washing up liquid is, quite rightly, frowned upon by 37 per cent of UK residents. One in ten (10 per cent) cite leaving tea stains from a wet spoon in the sugar bowl as one to avoid. Fussy: The survey found that 48 per cent of Brits prefer to make a cup of tea themselves, rather than trust someone else to make it because, they say, it just doesn't taste the same . A spokesperson for Whitworths Sugar, who commissioned the research, said: 'It’s really interesting the things that people will give up for a cup of tea - and how picky we are about how it’s made. 'According to our research, to create the perfect cup of tea you should use freshly boiled water, allowing the loose tea leaves to brew for about three minutes and add your preferred milk after water, with the sugar stirred in last.'","One fifth of women would rather go without sex than a cup of tea .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Rosemary Shearman, 72, was found murdered in the living room of her home in Hornchurch, Essex, on September 3 last year . A gambling addict who murdered an elderly member of his bridge club by stuffing a handkerchief in her mouth and beating her to death, has been jailed for 18 years. Thomaz Blazquez, a former Crown Prosecution Service worker, harboured ‘violent fantasies’ against Rosemary Shearman, 72, for six months because she owed him £30. Blazquez, 51, battered his victim and tied her up before killing her in the living room of her £500,000 detached home in Hornchurch, Essex, on September 3 last year. Mrs Shearman, a mother and grandmother who knew her attacker through the Gidea Bridge Club in Essex, was waiting alone at her house for a taxi to take her to Dover for a luxury cruise when she let her murderer in. Her body was discovered when the taxi driver arrived at her home but got no reply. He alerted neighbours who found her body lying on the living room and contacted police. A post-mortem revealed she had died of asphyxiation and blows to her stomach and hand. When officers arrived they found Blazquez, who worked for the Crown Prosecution Service for 25 years, in the bathroom trying to commit suicide. The jury took only three hours to find Blazquez guilty at Southwark Crown Court today. Judge Alistair McCreeth said: ‘Rosemary Shearman was a mother and a grandmother, someone with many about her who loved her and many who were her friends. Her death will be mourned by many. ‘The crime of murder carries only one sentence, imprisonment for life, and this is the sentence I now pass.' Blazquez, who had worked for many years as a case worker in the Old Bailey before moving to the homicide unit in Pimlico, had a history of depression and mental health problems. Colleagues said he worked for the agency’s team in the capital for almost a quarter of a century before leaving last November. Thomas Blazquez, 51, battered his victim and tied her up before killing her in the living room of her £500,000 detached home in Hornchurch, Essex, pictured . Mrs Shearman, a mother and grandmother, far left, enjoyed several day trips with friends before her death including one to Whitstable in July last year with Charlotte Fitch-Murphy, centre, Sara Fitch-Clark, right, and Larrissa Murphy, front . During that period he was involved in bringing to justice some of the country’s most high profile murderers and rapists. On the day of the murder, Blazquez, who lived South Woodford, east London, but was staying at his parents in Hornchurch, Essex, set out to his victim's home carrying a bag with a rope, duct tape and a knife. The jury heard when Mrs Shearman answered the door she was ‘friendly towards him’ saying he was lucky to catch her as she was about to go on a cruise. He demanded the £30 she owed him and, when she refused to give it to him straight away he lost his temper and started hitting her. Blazquez did not give evidence but his forensic psychiatrist Dr Carlo Longhitano told the court Blazquez had confessed to him while in custody at the John Howard institute. The jury heard Mrs Shearman pleaded with him saying ‘I will do anything you want’ but Blazquez told the doctor ‘she kept talking and talking’ so he repeatedly hit her before tying her up. He told the doctor: ‘I hit her in the stomach about three times, told her to keep quiet but she wouldn’t so I tried to put a handkerchief in her mouth and tie up her feet.’ He had earlier pleaded not guilty to murder but admitted the killing on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Judge McCreeth added the defendant was of ‘good character’ and his previous mental health problems should be taken into account when sentencing. Police were called to Mrs Shearman's home in Essex after a taxi driver, who arrived to collect the grandmother to take her on holiday, raised the alarm when she failed to answer the door .

He said: ‘The impairment of his mental functions, while of insufficient degree for diminished responsibility should in some measure reduce the minimum term.’ However he said the ‘savage’ nature of the ‘horrible murder’ argued against reducing the sentence to the minimum term. He said: ‘This was the murder of an elderly woman who was therefore someone vulnerable which took place in her own home into which she had unwillingly admitted the defendant. Friends described Mrs Shearman as a 'real giggle' ‘I accept he went to her home without the intention to kill her but as soon as he attacked her he was eager to do all he could to avoid the consequences of his actions and set about in a determined fashion to kill her. ‘It was a brutal attack, binding Rosemary, gagging her and carrying out a prolonged assault with blows, gagging and binding her despite her pleas and then stamping on her hand and chest. These are aggravating features. ‘Given the serious nature of the offence the minimum term should be 20 years, which I will shorten to 18 years.’ Prosecuting barrister Mark Dennis read out a statement from Mrs Shearman’s son Greg Shearman in which he spoke of the ‘devastation’ the death had caused. ‘On behalf of all the family the devastation and trauma this has caused us, and the community in which my mother lived for her entire life, is very difficult to put into words. We have lost a mother and grandmother.’ Mrs Shearman, a grandmother of five, had moved into the house with her husband Albert in 1979. Mr Shearman, a company director, died five years ago. She was a constant fixture at a weekly social group in her area and would take frequent trips with friends to the coast or abroad. On the day she was killed she was preparing to travel to the Canary Islands for a cruise. Charlotte Fitch Murphy, who runs the Ardleigh House Community Association where Mrs Shearman was a regular, described her as a ‘real giggle’. ‘She would come to all our events, would pop in to the centre several times a week and would go on every trip going,’ she said following her death last year. Rosemary Shearman, pictured front row second from left, enjoyed several day trips with friends prior to her tragic death, including one to Eastbourne in July last year, pictured . 'She loved sports, would play bowls and tennis and table tennis, and would make sure she had her tickets for Wimbledon every year. 'We went to Brighton for the day and we had a real laugh - we saw people sunbathing nude on the beach and she thought it was a hoot. 'We also went to Eastbourne for four days in June and to Whitstable for a day in July. And she had already paid the deposit for a trip to Turkey in December.' Mrs Shearman leaves behind a son, who runs a catering business in Wales, and a daughter who lives in Hong Kong. A CPS spokeswoman confirmed that Blazquez worked for CPS London as a case worker between January 1988 and November 2012.","Thomaz Blazquez, 51, battered Rosemary Shearman, 72, to death last year .

A young soldier who died after being crushed against a vehicle during a military exercise on Dartmoor was about to become a parent, his devastated family have revealed. Private Cameron Laing, 20, was struck by an uncoupled trailer and pinned against its towing vehicle at Bracken Tor youth hostel near Okehampton, Devon, on Tuesday evening.

Louis van Gaal hopes to conclude negotiations with Manchester United in the next few days, aware that potential members of his coaching staff are under pressure to clarify their positions with current employers. Guus Hiddink will take over as Holland head coach after the World Cup and Frank Hoek, Van Gaal’s goalkeeping coach, has promised to tell Hiddink today whether he will remain with the national team or move with Van Gaal to United. Another pressing issue for Van Gaal, it seems, is an assurance that transfer funds will extend to the signing of the three German players he thinks United need. As well as Bayern Munich’s Toni Kroos, Van Gaal wants Borussia Dortmund’s Marco Reus and Mats Hummels. Imminent? Thyce Sleggers says Louis van Gaal will be appointed Manchester United manager in the next week . Top target: Marco Reus is being eyed by Van Gaal as part of his Manchester makeover . Also wanted: Defender Mats Hummels (left) and midfielder Toni Kroos are on Van Gaal's wishlist . Senior sources at United are reluctant to confirm the appointment of a permanent successor to David Moyes is imminent, however. They argue that it might make sense to be patient and wait for someone such as Carlo Ancelotti to become available. Other . sources expect the process to accelerate, with Van Gaal very much the . favourite now that Ancelotti has guided his Real Madrid side to the . Champions League final. United . are keen to see interim player-manager Ryan Giggs and the Class of 92 — . namely Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville — remain part of any . future coaching set-up in the belief that ‘continuity is important’. With . Van Gaal keen to bring in a team of his own, including Hoek, a . potential for conflict in negotiations with United has been highlighted. Leader: Wayne Rooney will hope he is handed the captain's armband next season . In charge: Ryan Giggs is currently the interim manager at Manchester United . In . Holland, though, sources close to Van Gaal insist it is not an . insurmountable problem, given that the 62-year-old will see the value in . having individuals such as Giggs involved at the club. As . for his three German targets, their combined cost could be in excess of . £100million — before United even look at other signings, including Luke . Shaw and Adam Lallana. They . would certainly amount to an expensive trio, even though the cost could . be reduced if Shinji Kagawa returns to Dortmund as part of any deal. He . joined United from the German club in  June 2012. Van Gaal certainly wants talks to be concluded one way or the other as soon as possible.

As part of a deal with the ECB Flower will act as a mentor to captain Glen Chapple, who is now also in charge of first team matters. The opportunity arose to bring in Flower as part of his new role with the ECB, where he is now technical director of elite coaching, during which he is expected to work with all the counties.

Mike Watkinson, Lancashire cricket director, told the Manchester Evening News: ‘We thought it would be beneficial if Glen could tap in to some of Andy’s expertise in a mentoring role to help him with his additional leadership duties and some long-term planning so he can think about his transition from becoming a player to a coach if that’s what he decides to do.

"By . David Kent . Dennis Bergkamp could do the unthinkable and join Frank de Boer at Tottenham this summer, according to a source close to the Ajax manager. De Boer will hold talks with Spurs about becoming their next manager - and he could bring Arsenal legend Bergkamp with him to White Hart Lane. Bergkamp has enjoyed huge success working as De Boer's assistant - Ajax wrapped up the Dutch title last weekend - and the fomer Holland team-mates could once again link up at White Hart Lane. VIDEO Scroll down to see Tim Sherwood complain about managers discussing his job . Arsenal hero: Dennis Bergkamp on the shoulders of Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry in 2006 . Champagne moment: Bergkamp celebrates FA Cup success with Arsenal in 2005 . His most famous game? The Dutch master scored a sensational hat-trick at Leicester in 1997 . Bergkamp, who made 417 appearances for the Gunners, is still revered in the red half of north London and even has a statue outside the Emirates Stadium. While it is an unthinkable prospect for Arsenal fans, Dutch football journalist Joep Schreuder recently spoke with De Boer and said it is 'possible' that Bergkamp could link up again with his boss in north London. Asked whether De Boer would bring Bergkamp and Jaap Stam, the former Manchester United defender who is also his assistant at Ajax, with him to Spurs, Schreuder refused to rule out such a move. 'I have to laugh because I know Arsenal - the team of Bergkamp - and Tottenham are not best friends,' he told talkSPORT. 'Jaap . Stam, for example, is working with Frank de Boer and he's (supposed to . be) going to Milan - but maybe he's coming with De Boer to England. 'Maybe also he will bring some players to England, players like Daley Blind, the son of former Ajax captain Danny Blind. 'So it's all possible.'

On top: De Boer, 43, secured his fourth Eredivisie title in a row with a draw at Heracles on Sunday . Assistant: Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp (pictured right with Jaap Stam, left) is assistant to De Boer . Bergkamp still has huge affection for Arsenal, while members of the club’s hierarchy have earmarked him as a possible future Gunners boss. And given his emotional ties with Arsenal, it seems highly unlikely Bergkamp would agree to join bitter rivals Tottenham. But the 44-year-old Premier League legend has formed a strong working relationship with De Boer, winning three consecutive Eredivisie titles together. Spurs have begun identifying candidates to replace current boss Tim Sherwood, who is set to leave this summer. Club legend: A statue of Bergkamp stands outside Arsenal's Emirates Stadium . De Boer is a favourite among the Tottenham hierarchy, and speaking on Dutch TV On Tuesday the Holland legend confirmed the club’s interest. Tottenham’s intention to discuss the managerial role with De Boer was made directly to Ajax director of football Marc Overmars. 'Spurs haven’t had contact with my agent yet. They have approached Ajax, but that’s it,’ said De Boer. ‘Spurs have let Ajax know they would eventually talk to me when the season’s finished. ‘After the last league game (against NEC on Saturday) I’ll think about it,’ said De Boer. ‘I’ll talk to them and listen to what they have to say. I would like to add something to a club like Brendan Rodgers did at Liverpool. ‘I see a perspective at Tottenham Hotspur, just as Liverpool and Newcastle United sometimes are, they are sleeping giants.","Frank De Boer says Tottenham have approached Ajax over his services .

"By . Jason Mellor . Hatem Ben Arfa will be left to rot in the reserves as he faces a stiff club fine for speaking out over his Newcastle exile. After insisting he will fight tooth and nail to save his job, under pressure manager Alan Pardew is set to step up his cold war with the out of favour Frenchman, by hitting him in the pocket for giving an unauthorised interview to lift the lid on his Toon limbo. The club strictly monitors its players’ dealings with the media, and as well as a substantial fine, Ben Arfa is again set to be left out of the match-day squad when Newcastle host relegation-threatened Cardiff. Left to rot: Hatem Ben Arfa will rot in the reserves after speaking out over his Newcastle exile . Cold war: Newcastle boss Alan Pardew will fine the Frenchman for his unauthorised interview . Pardew wouldn’t give a direct reaction to Ben Arfa’s revelations that he was ‘sad and frustrated’ at being frozen out by the manager, who he confirmed he exchanged angry words with after the 4-0 defeat to Manchester United last month. The Newcastle manager said: 'Hatem has made those comments, but my comments are that I pick the team on merit. I’ve not picked the team for Cardiff yet. Hatem’s in our squad in terms of our rota of players, but I’ve not picked the teams or the subs at this stage. 'The only thing I’d say to the fans is that I hope the team comes first. It’s not about me or Hatem, it’s about the club which is much bigger than any of us as individuals. Exchange: Pardew and Ben Arfa had angry words after the defeat to Manchester United . 'In the current world of social media, there are all sorts of things you can react to, in terms of criticism that all managers have - you have to rise above it. 'Hatem trained with a different group to the group I trained with today. The disciplinary measures we have at the club go for all the players, not just Hatem. That procedure will remain in house and we’ll take care of it.' Pardew admits he faces one of the biggest tests of his managerial career after coming under increasing pressure, with supporters calling for his head after a nightmare run of six straight defeats - the club’s worst top flight run for 27 years. Fed-up fans are planning a mass second-half walkout during Saturday’s game against the Welsh side, but Pardew insists he and his under-fire players can weather the storm. He said: 'We have to be big enough and bold enough to cope with it. Protest: Newcastle fans have made their feelings about Pardew known . 'I’ll fight for the position I have here at this club, because I’ve always been proud to have this job. 'This has been the toughest run of results I’ve had as a manager and the most important thing is to get a performance that gets the stadium on our side to give us a platform to win the game. 'You never want to see it a bad reaction from supporters as a manager of course, and when you get the results we’ve had you have to accept it.

"By . Jonny Singer . Manchester United have banned two fans from going to away games indefinitely - one of them for as little as having a single can of lager found in his bag on the way in to a game. Jamie Bazley was stopped on the way in to St James’ Park earlier this month and given a police caution, simply because he had an unopened can of Stella Artois in his bag. As if that wasn’t enough, the club have now given him a ban from all domestic and European away games. 'Banned indefinitely' - the letter from Manchester United. An almost identical one was sent to both men . A letter, sent to the fan by Manchester United, said: ‘We have been informed by the Police that you were arrested at the above game and subsequently cautioned for possession of alcohol on entry. ‘The club has worked extensively with the FA, the Police and a number of local authorities to ensure our supporters are treated fairly and safely when supporting the Club at away grounds. This process is also linked to the allocation of tickets given to us as the away support. ‘People who breach these safety measures are jeopardising our ticket allocations for future matches. ‘As a result you will be banned from attending domestic and European away matches indefinitely.’ Bazley says he did not even know he had the alcohol on him, as it was at the bottom of the bag he was carrying. He claimed on Twitter that he ‘honestly thought I had drank [it] on the train’. Fanning the flames: The incident has led to outrage among Manchester United supporters on Twitter . The life-long fan hit out at the club, and says he may even stop going to home games, although his ban is only from away grounds. However, the men were allowed to renew their season tickets and will be permitted to attend home games. Like most football clubs Newcastle United do not allow anyone to bring alcohol into the ground or to drink in the stands - although there is a famous video of Magpies owner Mike Ashley necking a pint at the Emirates Stadium (below), where it is also illegal. This is not an isolated incident involving United. Another fan, Tom Molyneux has been given an identical ban for being arrested at the same match. Molyneux, 22, from Leigh in Greater Manchester, told MailOnline: 'I forgot I had a hip flask when entering the ground, and got arrested for it. I was released without charge three hours later, and thought that was the end of it. 'I renewed my season ticket yesterday morning as well, and they spoke to me like nothing had happened, then I got home from work and the letter was waiting for me, no first strike or nothing just a straight ban for ever. 'The club doesn't care about the supporters, just the money'. Both fans are planning to appeal in an attempt to overturn the bans. The club have taken the action as what fans do could have a negative effect on United's ticket allocation for future matches.","Jamie Bazley had can in his bag when he tried to enter St James' Park .

Clippers players expressed their disgust at the racist remarks Sterling allegedly made to his mistress by hiding the team's logo during Sunday night's game. And now the Heat players, including superstar LeBron James, took part in Charlotte before they took on the Bobcats in a touching display of solidarity to their West Coast brothers.

Meanwhile, Eric Miller, who is married . to Sterling's daughter Joanna Sterling Miller and is Director of . Basketball Administration for the Clippers told TMZ Sports that if his . father-in-law fires him for speaking up about the 'disgusting' rant, so . be it. Miller, who works in the day-to-day operation of the team, said he pledged his support to his team's players. 'I find the statements and representations made by the Clippers' team owner to be deplorable and disgusting,' he told TMZ. 'There is no room in sports or society in general, for racism. 'I pledge my full support for the wonderful players, coaches and staff members of the Clippers organization. I have complete faith that Commissioner Silver will deal with this matter swiftly and severely.' He added: 'If these comments should happen to cost me my employment with the team, it is but a small price to pay to speak out against ignorance and racism.' Joanna Sterling Miller said she was 'devastated and saddened by the cruel and insensitive comments expressed in these audio tapes.' NBA commissioner Adam Silver will hold a press conference Tuesday in New York City to address the association's investigation into the alleged racist remarks. Silver is facing significant pressure to punish Sterling, however there is little modern precedent for the outrageous comments so it's unclear what action will be taken. If he is somehow forced to sell the Clippers, Sterling would almost certainly bring about a lawsuit from the owner and a long and expensive legal fight. The players expressed their disgust at the racist remarks Sterling, pictured in 2010, allegedly made to his mistress V. Stiviano, seen with him, by hiding the team's logo during Sunday night's game. Vanessa Stiviano the women in the middle of the controversy with the Owner of the Clippers Donald Sterling was pictured Monday shielding her face with a strange visa . Donald . Sterling has been known to heckle his own team from the center-court . seat where he has sat for decades, whether with his now-estranged wife . or women young enough to be his granddaughters. Former . Los Angeles Clippers say the owner would barge into the locker room to . berate players, offer awkward praise or - according to testimony in a . lawsuit filed by his fired general manager - tell guests to check out . his players' 'beautiful black bodies.' Opponents . say the racially incendiary remarks attributed to Sterling and leaked . to TMZ last weekend publicly show a side of the 80-year-old real-estate . mogul that has been ignored and rationalized for years. 'It . put a smile on my face that finally he would be unable to deny the . racist allegations against him,' said Carl Douglas, a lawyer who . represented former Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor in a lawsuit . against Sterling. 'This . is a guy who, as the owner, sits courtside at the half-court line,' Douglas added. 'No other owner sits like that. He has an ego the size of . the Grand Canyon.' The Los Angeles Clippers players listen to the national anthem on Sunday wearing their warmup jerseys inside out to protest alleged racial remarks by team owner Donald Sterling before Game 4 of an opening-round NBA basketball playoff series against the Golden State Warriors . Sterling's alleged recorded comments included a personal attack on Magic Johnson, pictured in November, which came as a shock to the Dodgers owner and retired Lakers superstar . Sterling . has faced extensive federal charges of civil rights violations and . racial discrimination in business, making shocking race-related . statements in sworn testimony before reaching multimillion-dollar . settlements. He . has also been sued for sexual harassment by former employees, and the . court proceedings detailed an outlandish list of Sterling's personal . proclivities. Baylor, the former NBA great who served as the Clippers' GM for 22 years, left the franchise with rancor and an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging race and age discrimination. Baylor claimed Sterling has a 'plantation mentality' about the Clippers, envisioning a team of 'poor black boys from the South playing for a white coach.' 'When I heard that voice (on the TMZ recordings), there was a visceral reaction,' said Douglas, who deposed Sterling during Baylor's lawsuit. 'I recognized the venom in that voice.' Sterling's new embarrassment might lead to his long-term banishment from the NBA. Several major Clippers sponsors dropped or re-evaluated their association with the team Monday, including State Farm, CarMax, Kia Motors America, Virgin America and Red Bull. Shelley Sterling, left, wife of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, watches from a court side seat during the second half in Game 4 of an opening-round NBA basketball playoff series between the Clippers and Golden State Warriors on Sunday. She later had dinner with her estranged husband . But amid the national outrage over the Clippers owner's apparent comments last weekend, former NBA star Kevin Johnson asked the question that must be addressed by Commissioner Adam Silver and the owners who control the league. 'We wanted (Silver) to give us a full accounting of the prior accusations of racism made against Mr. Sterling and why those were never sanctioned by the NBA,' said Johnson, who was asked by Clippers guard Chris Paul to speak for the players' union membership. 'It's our responsibility to find out the history of Mr. Sterling, and why sanctions did not occur.' Anyone with even a passing knowledge of Sterling's history of discrimination charges and outlandish statements wasn't surprised by the latest revelations. Sterling's alleged recorded comments included a personal attack on Magic Johnson, which came as a shock to the Dodgers owner and retired Lakers superstar. 'I had a friendship with him, so for him to then make these alleged comments about myself ... there's no place in our society for it,' Johnson said of ABC's pregame show Sunday.","Whole Miami Heat team make gesture against Donald Sterling .

"By . Katy Winter . An enterprising British schoolboy is tasting sweet success in the U.S. after appearing on the cover of children's Time magazine - thanks to his grandfather's fudge recipe. Fraser Bawtree, 13, started making the fudge with the recipe handed down by his grandfather Nick to make a few pounds to pay for a school trip. But his product was such a success with his family and friends he decided to set up his own firm at the age of eleven. Fraser Bawtree started selling fudge using a recipe handed down to him by his grandfather Nick as a way of raising a few pounds toward a school trip . Fraser became an overnight celebrity in the U.S. after appearing on the cover of Time for Kids (right) In his first year of trading Fraser had a turnover of £13,000 and this year - after taking on an adult marketing manager - is set to turn over £40,000. His frasersfudj online shop is getting orders from fans in the U.S. as well as Japan and all over Europe. The youngster became an overnight star after being chosen to cover American magazine Time For Kids, which has eight million readers. Fraser, who lives with father Tim and mother Zoe, in Cheltenham, Glos., said: 'Being on the front cover of Time magazine for kids is a huge honour. 'Apparently it has eight million readers in the U.S. I'm very proud that I managed to achieve my goals. It has been a real boost to my confidence. The recipe was given to Fraser by his grandfather (pictured with baby Fraser), retired physics teacher Nick, from Perth, Scotland, who died eight years ago aged 66 . 'I want to keep building my business, it has been a real experience moving from making fudge at home to having it made in a specialist factory.' Fraser has struggled at school because he has dyslexia but is determined that will not hold back his business dreams. He added: 'Being dyslexic, I find school work hard work, my cooking is a way of relaxing and working out all the costings and profit margins helps me with my maths too. 'People think that having dyslexia is a problem, but look at me now. One day I hope to have my own factory where I can make all sorts of Fudj products. 'I'm really pleased with how it has gone. I have always enjoyed cooking at home, especially sweet things like cookies, cakes and fudge. 'Mum helps me with the marketing but I do all the rest.' Fraser has funded his first overseas fact-finding mission to Shanghai and has been invited by TV chef Jamie Oliver to exhibit at his upcoming Big Feastival. Fraser has struggled at school due to dyslexia but is determined that will not hold back his business dreams . Fraser aged 3 with his grandfather Nick who taught him to make biscuits, jam and of course fudge, sparking his passion for cooking . Although he doesn't pay himself a wage - pouring all profits back into the business - he does allow himself the odd perk - like a new bike. The talented youngster has branched out into making gift packages as well as different varieties including rum and raisin, popping candy and chocolate marshmallow. His online shop has been so successful he has now moved production to a small factory. Father Tim, 43, said the recipe was given to Fraser by his grandfather, retired physics teacher Nick, from Perth, Scotland, who died eight years ago aged 66. Tim said: 'It's nice that it's a Scottish recipe because we are a Scottish family. 'The recipe that Fraser uses was given to him by his granddad when he was a small boy. 'In his spare time my dad loved baking and cooking and often taught Fraser how to make biscuits, jam and fudge. From selling it at school it has taken on a life of its own and grown into a proper business. 'When we said he was going to have to earn some money for the school trip I thought it meant my car would get washed a few times. 'Unfortunately that hasn't happened. But he has allowed us to test some of the flavours, so I suppose I shouldn't complain.'","Fraser Bawtree started to make fudge as a way to fund a school trip .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Workers have begun a last-ditch attempt to save a notorious 10,000-year-old route on top of one of the country's highest summits. Striding Edge is a dangerous knife-edged path on Helvellyn, in the Lake District, but years of erosion along the route is damaging wildlife. Now more than 100 tonnes of stone are being shipped to the path, via helicopter, to try to restore its surface. In the Lake District, walkers were treated to a dramatic sight as a helicopter, pictured, was drafted in to save an eroding mountain ridge. Striding Edge, on the approach to Helvellyn is a challenging ridge, know as an arete, created by two glaciers . A total of 136 helicopter trips and three months of intense work will attempt to hide the easier paths created by the hundreds-of-thousands of climbers that visit each year. Richard Fox is the Ranger for Fix The Fells, the team carrying out the work, and is adamant work needs to be done as soon as possible. It is one of England's few mountanious regions - all land in England above 3,000ft (910 metres) lies in the Lake District National Park. The highest peak is Scafell Pike at 3,209ft (978 metres) - the tallest mountain in England. It belongs to a rock group called Borrowdale Volcanic Series, which is resistant to weathering and dates back 500 million years. Many features in the Lake District are the result of glaciation, which ended 15,000 years ago. The large 'U-shaped' valleys were formed by retreating glaciers. He said: 'People have created new paths when trying to avoid the original route along Striding Edge and this has caused erosion. 'The soil is being washed into [the lake] Red Tarn, and changing the acidic levels in the water. 'Species of Arctic fish there need the right conditions to lay their eggs. 'It isn't just about the wildlife though. We are trying to make the route look natural again. 'It is a sensitive sight and people will think it should be left alone. But we are doing this to conserve the landscape. 'We are successful if you can't tell we have been there when our work is finished.' There can be up to 2,000 climbers on the route at any one time, and it is only in the last 30 to 40 years that the eroded land has become a problem. Tanya Oliver, program manager for Fix the Fells, led by the National Trust, added: 'The rocks are being delivered so people don't see other paths that have emerged, and don't use them again. 'We will be putting information boards highlighting the dangers on Striding Edge for climbers unfamiliar of the challenge.' The route is popular with walkers taking on the 3,100ft (950 metres) summit of Helvellyn, but over the years erosion has caused problems. National Trust Rangers and a helicopter, pictured, were drafted in to transport 135 bags of stone, weighing 188 stone (750kg) each up to the mountain ridge to disguise the easier routes . The scenery of the Lake District was created largely by glacial movements of the last ice age between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago and the volcanic eruptions that preceded it. The stones (pictured) should help to preserve the area from further erosion . Striding Edge (pictured) is part of the Helvellyn mountain in the English Lake District. The mountain is 3,117 feet (950 metres) above sea level and is the third highest peak in England. Striding Edge is a popular scrambling route that stretches for over a mile (1.6 kilometres) to the Helvellyn summit plateau .","Work is underway to save a path from destruction in the Lake District .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Success comes in many shapes and sizes, but some people continually seem to achieve, while others fail. And now scientists have found that success really does breed success – at least up to a point. They discovered that people who receive help early on in their endeavours and experience a boost in confidence, are often more successful than people who do not receive a helping hand to start with. Success breeds success:  Scientists found that people who receive help early on in their endeavours and experience a boost in confidence are often more successful than people who do not receive a helping hand to start with . Scientists from University College London and Stony Brook University in New York conducted four experiments that measured the impact of  support – such as a donation or positive endorsement – on subsequent success. They found that success was more likely to follow initial assistance for crowd-funders on kickstarter.com and that people given an initial donation were around twice as likely to receive further contributions as others who only received funding through standard routes. They also observed that the granting of a dozen signatures to a randomly selected petition led to a cause attracting further endorsements more often than petitions that did not receive the orchestrated support. However, the magnitude of the support offered had little effect on the outcome. Researchers found that success was more likely to follow initial assistance for crowd-funders on kickstarter.com. People given an initial donation were twice as likely to receive further contributions . ‘Theoretically, it’s hard to see if the “success breeds success” effect exists - it could be that it reflects genuine ability,' Dr Arnout van de Rijt, of Stony Brook University and lead author of the paper said. 'To tease out where the success comes from, we did experiments that gave artificial help to some people and not others.' In the first experiment, the researchers donated funding to 100 of 200 new and unfunded projects on kickstarter.com and monitored the level of later funding. Almost 40 per cent of projects without the initial donation attracted future donations, compared with 70 per cent of those given the 'experimental donation'. The second experiment involved the website epinions.com, for which reviewers are paid for evaluations of new products according to how helpful website visitors rate their reviews. A total of nine out of ten reviews that received experimental endorsements were rated as ‘very helpful’ within two weeks of treatment, compared to 77 per cent in the sample without the initial boost. In the third test, a random sample of the top 1 per cent most productive editors on Wikipedia were given an award. During the observation period of five months, just under one third of the editors without this start received a status award, whereas 40 per cent of those given an initial status award attracted at least one more award. The fourth test used the petition website change.org, where people seek support from the general public for social and political goals through electronic signature campaigns. Interestingly, the scientist found that giving twice as much funding or signatures did not guarantee twice the success. Dr Soong Moon Kang at UCL said: ‘Our research has implications for the success of initiatives to counter inequality and create a more meritocratic society. It also suggests that these don’t need to be big or costly to help: it’s the initial boost that matters. ‘We also find that interventions have much more effect on those coming from very little.’ Heads down: In a separate study, students who were told that failing an exam would prevent them from finding a good job reported feeling less motivated and performed worse in exams than those given encouragement. Pupils taking a GCSE mathematics exam are pictured . Teachers who use the fear of failure in a bid to get students to knuckle down and revise hard for GCSEs and A Levels may be having a negative effect on their success, according to a new study. Students who were told that failing an exam would prevent them from finding a good job reported feeling less motivated and performed worse in exams than those given encouragement. The study, led by Edge Hill University in Lancashire, looked at different styles of pre-exam persuasive messages used by teachers, the impact they can have on students’ motivation and ultimately, their academic performance. It found that messages that used scare tactics, such as ‘if you fail the exam, you will never be able to get a good job or go to university,’ achieved fewer positive results than messages that focused on success, like ‘the exam is really important as most jobs that pay well require that you pass and if you want to go to college you will also need to pass the exam’. Students who said they felt threatened by messages that frequently focused on failure reported feeling less motivated and performed worse in their tests than students who reported that their teacher used fewer fear tactics.","People who receive help early on in their .

"By . Michelle Daniels . Lying in a private room on the labour ward, exhausted from giving birth, I desperately tried to block out the noise all around me. The screams of a woman in labour gave way to the cry of a newborn baby. I heard the father phoning relatives, elated as he announced the arrival of his daughter. It was too much for me to bear. For as I cradled my baby girl Emily, tenderly stroking her soft, plump cheeks, my husband Richard and I stared at her tiny chest, willing it to rise and fall, yet knowing it never would. Grieving: Richard and Michelle Daniels who lost daughter Emily . Emily had been stillborn by emergency caesarean at 11.31pm on December 19, weighing 8lb 1oz. Her heart, which we’d heard beating so loudly on a monitor at the hospital that morning, had stopped during labour. Quite why, no one knew at that point. We had been robbed of the life we’d imagined as a family of four with our five-year-old son, Finlay. I’d had a healthy pregnancy and all the indications from the scans were that my baby was healthy. In the moments after her birth, as we were consumed by sadness, our pain was only compounded by our surroundings on a ward full of the sounds of new life. The room was cold and clinical, a place for enduring the physical pain of labour, not mourning the tragic death of a baby. A Perspex cot stood empty in one corner, leaflets on breastfeeding littered a table and there was a neat pile of baby clothes provided by the hospital for parents who aren’t prepared for their new arrival. There was no sofa or double bed on which Richard and I could sit close, our arms around each other, holding Emily together. There was no soundproofing to silence the noise beyond the room or soft lighting. Only reminders all around us of what we’d just lost. As a nurse, I cannot fault the care we received at the Queen’s Medical Centre (QMC) in Nottingham, where Emily was born. Yet while still in the throes of our grief, there are two things Richard and I are certain we don’t want. The first is pity, because we are far from the only family to suffer such a shattering loss. The second is for any other couple to endure the agony of spending their few precious moments with their stillborn infant with the audible backdrop of a labour suite or maternity ward. This is the reason we want to share our story to raise awareness of the need for bereavement suites in hospital maternity units. Michelle recalls: 'In the moments after her birth, as we were consumed by sadness, our pain was only compounded by our surroundings on a ward full of the sounds of new life' We hope to raise £50,000 for such a facility at the QMC and others at hospitals across the country.I married Richard, who is 37 and has his own accountancy and management consultancy, in May 2005 and Finlay was born in November 2008. When I found out I was pregnant last spring, we were delighted. At the 20-week scan, however, I was told I had a condition called placenta previa, where the placenta blocks the cervix, making a natural birth impossible. But it often rights itself, so I was put under the care of a brilliant obstetrician and given regular scans to monitor it. Finlay had been desperate to know the sex of ‘his’ baby and helped pick out the exact shade of pink for his sister’s bedroom. Two weeks before my baby was due, a scan showed the placenta had moved, meaning I could have a natural birth after all. On December 19, I went to the hospital for an appointment to kickstart labour. That’s when we listened to our baby’s heart beating so loudly. Stillbirth is 15 times more common than cot death, according to official figures . We returned home and by early evening the contractions were coming fast, so we abandoned Finlay’s bedtime story and made a mad dash to take him to stay with Richard’s parents. On arrival at the QMC at 9pm, two midwives immediately got a monitor to listen to my baby’s heartbeat. When they couldn’t hear it, they assumed there was a fault with the machine or it was due to the position in which I was lying. But a second monitor was also silent. Suddenly there was panic in the room. The registrar arrived with a portable ultrasound machine and spoke the words we never wanted to hear: our baby wasn’t moving and it was suspected she’d died. I’d need an emergency caesarean to deliver her. What happened after that is a blur. I remember lying on the operating table with Richard standing beside me, sobbing. We clung to the hope there had been a mistake and our baby was still alive or that they would be able to revive her. When she was delivered, we held our breath, praying she’d cry. But there was no sound except the beeping of machines and our sobs. Wrapped in a pink blanket, our daughter was brought to us by the midwife in the recovery room a few minutes later. We decided to call her Emily. It wasn’t on our shortlist of names, but it was pretty, just like her, and it was so important to us that she had an identity. Emily was perfect and with lots of dark brown hair. She looked very much like Finlay did as a baby, with a button nose and beautiful rosebud lips. Her cheeks felt soft and warm and there was a flicker when we touched them, which is a normal reflex action. We simply couldn’t believe she was never going to open her eyes. A small funeral was held on January 7 with only Michelle and Richard's parents, siblings and one of the midwives present . The theatre staff were upset, particularly the anaesthetist, who confided that his sister had suffered two stillbirths. That’s when we started to realise how common this is. There is a one in 200 chance of having a stillborn baby — that’s as many as 17 a day in Britain. At the QMC, there have been two more since we lost Emily. At 4am, Richard called our parents to give them the heart-wrenching news that their longed for granddaughter hadn’t survived. They were distraught. But how were we going to explain it to Finlay? At dawn, Richard left Emily and me to go to him. I have no idea how he had the strength to tell Finlay that Emily had been poorly and had gone to live with the angels. Apparently, he buried his head in his daddy’s shoulder and cried his little heart out. On the second night, Richard stayed with Finlay while my mum sat with me at the hospital, holding me as I became increasingly traumatised by the sounds of families celebrating new arrivals. When Richard returned the next morning, he had to pass new fathers excitedly carrying baby car seats into the hospital. The midwife gave us a white cardboard memory box in the shape of a treasure chest containing a teddy bear, candle and kit with which to take prints of Emily’s hands and feet, which we did before leaving hospital later that day. Though I was desperate to get home to Finlay and away from the labour suite, it was agonising saying goodbye to our daughter, who was taken to the chapel of rest. Michelle says 'I have no idea how he (husband Richard) had the strength to tell Finlay (their son) that Emily had been poorly and had gone to live with the angels' We had a small funeral on January 7 with only our parents, siblings and one of the midwives present. Richard and I had an hour-and-a-half at home alone with Emily that morning. We wanted to feel her presence in our house, to cradle her in her bedroom and know she’d once been there. In February, there was more agony when the test results came back. It revealed I’d had an antenatal condition where the placenta functions during pregnancy, but fails under the stress of labour. There’s no way of screening for it during pregnancy as it can be diagnosed only by tests following a stillbirth. The tragic irony is that had the placenta previa not rectified itself in those final weeks, I’d have had a planned caesarean and the chances are Richard and I would have a healthy baby. When we took the first steps towards setting up our charity, Forever Stars, in January, we aimed for 100 followers on our Facebook page. We now have more than 4,000 from Alaska to Australia, and have received messages from 1,000 parents who were left to grieve for their stillborn baby in hospital in similar circumstances. The same story recurs — the medical care and staff are fantastic, but hospitals don’t have a private place to grieve and spend precious time with your baby. When we spoke to them, the QMC told us they had already recognised a need for a dedicated, peaceful but medically equipped bereavement suite. Richard and I would love to try for another baby, but there’s a risk I’d have the same placenta problem, so I’d be given a caesarean at 37 weeks. Like Finlay, he or she will grow up knowing they had a beautiful sister called Emily, who will be part of our family forever. www.foreverstars.org or www.facebook.com/foreverstars .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman is suing a hospital where surgeons left a four-inch plastic tube inside her, resulting in her losing half a lung when it was removed. Julie Jones, 51, underwent surgery to have her spleen removed in October 2009 and thought she had made a full recovery. But she claims doctors at St James’ University Hospital, in Leeds, had left a tube inside her lung which threatened to kill her at any moment if it pierced her liver. Julie Jones claims surgeons left a tube inside her lung during surgery to remove her spleen . The problem was only spotted when Ms Jones, who moved from Leeds to Devon in 2011, began to feel seriously unwell and went to hospital for a scan and chest X-ray. Staff at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital immediately detected the tube and advised a non-invasive operation to try and remove it. But after six failed attempts they decided to operate and take out half of her lung, leaving the mother-of-four disabled. Ms Jones said: 'When the doctor told me that I would have to have part of my lung removed I asked him what exactly the ""foreign body"" was. 'The doctor just told me I’d been horribly let down on my last operation and showed me the X-ray of my chest. 'When I saw the tube in my lung I was immediately sick, I couldn’t even eat anything for three days because I was so repulsed. After six failed attempts to remove the tube, surgeons were forced to take out half of her lung, leaving the mother-of-four disabled . Ms Jones said: 'The surgeons told me that the tube was only one centimetre away from my liver. At any minute it could have slipped down and pierced it, killing me' 'How on earth could a team of ten surgeons have missed a four-inch plastic tube with shiny metal clips - it’s terrifying and disgusting.' She added: 'The surgeons told me that the tube was only one centimetre away from my liver. 'At any minute it could have slipped down and pierced it, killing me.' Since the operation last November, Ms Jones, a former cleaning supervisor, says she has been left breathless, lethargic and unable to walk more than a few paces. She said: 'I used to be really active; I used to love walking and I worked for a living. 'Now I can’t even take more than a few steps until I’m knackered. She added: 'Through negligence, those doctors have ruined my life - I won't ever be the same again' 'I have basically been left disabled for the rest of my life because those surgeons in Leeds left a plastic tube inside me. 'I don’t know if those surgeons were half asleep, drunk or what. But there were ten of them involved in the operation - ten of them - and nobody noticed it. It’s terrifying.' She added: 'I think people need to know that this sort of thing does happen. How many people might already be dead?' Ms Jones is now suing The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust for medical negligence. She said: 'I’m never going to get much better than I am now, I’m never going to have normal life again. 'Through their negligence, those doctors have ruined my life - I won’t ever be the same again. 'Just a simple thing like walking to the shops is impossible for me and it’s all the fault of those surgeons - how could they let this happen?' Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust has confirmed Ms Jones was a patient at St James’ University Hospital and that they are looking into a legal claim dating back to 2011. A spokesman said: 'We are unable to comment on this case as a legal claim is ongoing.' A spokesperson for the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'I can confirm this patient had an operation at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital where a foreign body was removed from her chest.'","Julie Jones had surgery to remove her spleen and assumed all was OK .

Amazon says the service, called Prime Pantry, will offer users an expanded selection of items that they usually pick up in grocery stores. To use the service, customers must have an amazon Prime membership. Club members fill up to a 45-pound box with groceries and get it shipped for a flat rate of $5.99. When Prime members shop through Prime Pantry, it shows how much space each item takes up in the grocery box, and how much room is left. Items are shipped within one to four business days. Some items now available are single boxes of Cheerios, a six-pack of Bounty paper towels and Coca-Cola fridge packs. Amazon calls the offerings 'low-priced, everyday essentials in everyday sizes.' When Prime members shop through Prime Pantry, it shows how much space each item takes up in the grocery box, and how much room is left. Items are shipped within one to four business days. The move comes as Amazon has been bulking up services for its Prime membership program, since it increased the annual membership price to $99 from $79 in March to help offset rising shipping costs. In addition to free two-day shipping, the service includes free access to Amazon Instant Video, a streaming video service that will include some HBO programming beginning in May. Amazon is also believed to be still pursuing its plan for a drone delivery service . The move is an 'important development in Amazon's aggressive push into consumables,' said Sanford Bernstein analyst Carlos Kirjner said. The Seattle company has also been testing Prime Fresh, a grocery delivery service, in several cities. Shares of Amazon, which reports first quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, rose 3.3 percent, or $10.76, to $335.34. After hitting an all-time high Jan. 22, the stock has retreated about 20 percent. To make spending our money easier, Amazon has launched a magic wand-style device called Dash that acts as a handheld, personal shopping assistant. It scans barcodes of items that are running low in cupboards or fridges, for example, or customers use voice commands to add goods to an online shopping list.

Amazon Dash is a free device but only works with Amazon Fresh, which is only available in Southern California, San Francisco and certain neighbourhoods in Seattle. Although Amazon hasn’t revealed when its Fresh service will be rolled out globally, Amazon's UK vice president Doug Gurr said in February: ‘We don’t publish forward strategy plans but history would suggest that once we roll out something across North America, typically that leads to international expansion.’ In addition to groceries, Amazon Fresh sells a total of 500,000 items including electronics, household tools, software, games and entertainment. The Amazon Dash tool complements Amazon's  Flow app that launched in February. Flow uses augmented reality to help people discover information about items around them. For example, when a user holds the phone’s camera over an object - such as a book, game or box of cereal - the app will identify what it is, and reveal more information about the product. This includes the author, release date, calories of food items, and more. It also lets users scan and dial phone numbers of launch websites from magazines, adverts or posters. Other items will start playing audio clips or video clips when the app scans it. Amazon Flow works in a similar way to Google’s Googles. Once an item has been identified, it can be shared on social networks or that item can be bought directly from Amazon. Dash, pictured, connects to a smartphone or laptop via Wi-Fi.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Plenty of parents feel guilty when they are just too tired to play with their enthusiastic children. But one father has created a robot to take over when he needs to put his feet up. Kare Halvorsen, 41, has made a rolling robot that looks like a futuristic football when it is folded up, to keep his three-year old son, Torbjorn, occupied for hours. Scroll down for video . Press play: Kare Halvorsen created a rolling robot that looks like a futuristic football when it is folded up to keep his three-year old son, Torbjorn (pictured) occupied for hours . MorpHex is not the only spherical robot. Nasa's Tumbleweed is a prototype developed by its Jet Propulsion laboratory (JLR) which is imagined as a new way of exploring planets. A 'Rotundus groundbot' robot, originally developed by Esa, has two cameras protruding from it and is now sold as a commercial surveillance solution. The ball has a fixed axis and also has built in sensors, microphones and speakers. It can travel on sand, snow and mud because of its rugged surface. MorpHex is a mobile ball robot that is really a hexapod - with six legs. When its legs come together the robot forms a sphere that can roll. The Norwegian engineer came up with the idea of building his own robots after his son was given a Japanese toy as a present just after he was born and he thought: ‘I can do better than that’. His latest invention is a rolling, spider-like robot that is programmed to keep just ahead of his son as he chases it around. MorpHex is a hexapod robot that travels along as a ball. When its legs come together the robot forms a sphere that can roll, but it can also scuttle along. When curled up as a sphere, the robot can roll fast down hills but can unfurl so that it has six legs upon which to scuttle slowly and delicately along. The top of the sphere can open up, which gives the robot the appearance of a lotus flower. Roll with it:The robot travels fastest as a fully-formed sphere, but can use its feet to propel itself along fairly quickly on a flat surface, and scuttle slowly too . All set to scuttle: MorpHex is hexapod as well as a robot that travels along as a ball. When its legs come together the robot forms a sphere which can roll, but it can also scuttle delicately along, as pictured here . This top part can also be used as more legs so that when both sets are extended, they can be used to propel the robots swiftly along on its side on a flat surface. The semi-spherical robot can be steered like this and can also be programmed to evade the clutches of a person chasing it. Mr Halvorsen, who works as a consultant engineer for Rogaland county council in western Norway, said building robots is his passion and as far as he knows the ball-shaped MorpHex rolling robot he has made is unique. ‘My son is my biggest fan and making the robots for him to play with is a big motivation,’ he said. ‘He really loves them. Every day he wants one of them unpacked so that he can play with it. His favourite is the one I call A-pod because it looks like an ant.’ Blooming marvellous: Here the robot is fully unfurled and looks a little like a lotus flower.

"A mother-of-four who 'died' while giving birth has made a miraculous recovery. Rachel Morris, 31, gave birth to a healthy baby boy - despite her heart stopping for more than two-and-a-half minutes during the birth. Mrs Morris, who was giving birth to her youngest child, James, also lost six litres of blood during the traumatic emergency C-section. Rachel Morris, 31, from Cheltenham, nearly died giving birth to baby James 11 months ago . Mrs Morris lost six litres of blood and her heart stopped for two minutes during James's delivery . But now, 11 months on, both mother and baby have made a full recovery. She said: 'I really can't believe what happened. I was incredibly poorly, but having James was totally worth it. 'When I got to hold him for the first time it was amazing - we are both fighters, I'm very proud.' Mrs Morris's problems began at her 20-week scan, when it was discovered she was suffering with placenta preavia - a condition which means the placenta is covering the cervix. Mrs . Morris, from Cheltenham, said: 'I already have three beautiful girls but I was over the . moon when I became pregnant again, as my husband Kevin had always wanted . a little boy to complete our family. 'But . during my 20 week scan doctors discovered I had placenta preavia - I . was really shocked, my other three pregnancies had been really straight . forward. Mrs Morris's problems started when her 20 week scan showed her placenta was lying over her cervix meaning she would not be able to give birth naturally and that she was at risk of bleeds . 'Due to the condition, I couldn't give birth naturally, so I was going to have to have a Caesarean. 'I . then started to have bleeds from 27 weeks, which doctors warned me about, . but every single one was heart-rending as I thought I was losing my . baby.' As a precaution, doctors decided to keep her in hospital for the last eight weeks of the pregnancy, or until the baby was born, for both of their safety. Mrs . Morris said: 'I was distraught - I wanted to make sure the baby was OK . but my three girls were at home suffering without their mummy. 'But I'm so relieved now that I stayed in - just over 12 hours later, I was fighting for my life.' When she was 27 weeks pregnant she started experiencing bleed and eight weeks before her due date was admitted to hospital for observation. She is pictured with husband Kevin, baby James and daughters Ellamay, Jessica-Sophie and Felicity . During her first night in hospital Mrs Morris (pictured before the birth) woke up in agony, covered in blood . On the first night she was in hospital, Mrs Morris woke up in agony and covered in blood. 'I . remember waking up in the early hours of the morning with a surging pain . gushing through my body and I was covered in blood,' she recalled. 'The nurses came in and it was like something out of a horror film. 'A few hours later I was taken down to theatre and put under while they delivered James. 'That's when all hell broke loose. I remember waking up after it all in a complete daze and was overwhelmed with pain. Mrs Morris was rushed to the operating theatre and put under general anaesthetic so James could be delivered. He had to stay in hospital for four weeks because he was born eight weeks early . When surgeons removed Mrs Morris's placenta they realised it was attached to an artery and she started to haemorrhage. Her heart stopped for two-and-a-half minutes. Image shows James with two of his sisters . 'When the nurse and my husband told me what had happened, it didn't seem real, I was just in total shock.' During the operation, which was performed under general anaesthetic because of the heavy bleeding, doctors delivered baby James and then tried to remove the placenta. At this point, they discovered the placenta was attached to an artery. As a result, she began to haemorrhage and her heart stopped beating for two-and-a-half minutes. With her life hanging in the balance, the only way to save her was to remove her womb. To save Mrs Morris's life, surgeons had to remove her womb. Image shows James in hospital . Mrs Morris had to be put on a life support machine in intensive care but was well enough to go home five days later. James followed her three weeks later and is now 11 months old . Mrs Morris said: 'The doctors had to think quickly and they decided to remove my womb, which was the only way to stop the bleeding. 'I was put on a life support and blood bypass machine so all the blood I lost could be pumped straight back into my body. 'My husband, Kevin, had been outside the whole time with my mother and was hysterical - he saw nurses running past with bags of blood and knew they were for me. 'The doctors told them to prepare for the worst - it must have been awful for them.' Mrs Morris says she feels incredibly lucky to be alive to look after her children. Image shows a scan of James . During James's traumatic delivery, his father, Kevin, was waiting outside the operating theatre and saw nurses rushing in with bags of blood for his desperately ill wife . Remarkably, just five days after Mrs Morris's terrible ordeal, she was able to go home. Baby James was born eight weeks early so had to spend four weeks in hospital before he was able to go home as well. Mrs Morris: 'I feel so blessed to be here after what happened and to be able to look after my four precious children. 'We will be celebrating James' first birthday next month and it will be a great marker to show how far we've both come.'","Rachel Morris, 31, nearly died giving birth to James, her fourth child .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Was the turbulent reign of David Moyes at Manchester United necessarily his fault? One researcher says he might have been doomed from the outset, owing to how Sir Alex Ferguson ‘over-achieved’ at the club. But ultimately even science may not redeem him – the final straw was likely more to do with ‘politics than the performance of the club’. Science behind the sacking? Research suggests David Moyes is the 10th greatest manager in the last 40 years of English football, so why didn't he survive at United? The information is based on research by Dr. Stefan Szymanski, a Professor of Sport Management in the Department of Kinesiology at the University of Michigan. For the last three decades he has been measuring the performance of managers against the wage spending of their club. (Points according to Dr. Szymanski's data) 1. Sir Alex Ferguson - 549.9 . 2. Harry Redknapp - 398.9 . 3. Steve Coppell - 337.1 . 4. Alan Curbishley - 336.3 . 5. Arsene Wenger - 294.0 . 6. Dario Gradi - 277.9 . 7. David Bassett 277.4 . 8. Peter Reid - 269.0 . 9. Denis Smith - 268.8 . 10. David Moyes - 266.8 . 11. Graham Taylor - 266.3 . 12. Jim Smith - 263.0 . 13. Bobby Robson - 259.0 . 14. Tony Pulis - 254.4 . 15. Neil Warnock - 252.2 . 16. Ron Atkinson - 248.9 . 17. Howard Wilkinson 244.6 . 18. Howard Kendall 240.7 . 19. John Rudge 237.3 . 20. Kevin Keegan 236.6 . ... 117. Jose Mourinho 64.9 . What he has found is that some can be regarded as underachievers – but more often than not managers overachieve. The number of points a manager gets from a game from the data depends on the relative quality of the team and the opponent. If the team’s wages are twice as high as the opponents then in a sense they are twice as good. If the points actually won are greater than this expectation than they are attributed to the manager, which is how points are accumulated. United, for example, won a lot under Ferguson simply because they had better players, says Dr. Szymanski. But they won even more than predicted, so the extra points are credited to Ferguson. This gives Ferguson a total score 549.9, putting him top of the pile. In second is Harry Redknapp with 398.9 points. For managers that have underachieved, they find themselves with minus points. Ian St. John, manager of Portsmouth from 1974 to 1977, comes in last with a score of -37.4 thanks to a rather dismal win percentage of 25 per cent with the club. Jose Mourinho, meanwhile, comes in at 117th, owing to him having a 'boatload of money' but not necessarily overachieving in his first stint at Chelsea. The points so far, however, are based on provisional data and may still be revised. Perhaps unsurprisingly Sir Alex Ferguson tops the list, and it may be this 'over-achievement' that meant even a manager with the previous stature of Moyes was not able to fill his boots . ‘Basically . my research has generally focused on the relation between team wage . spending and performance,’ Dr. Szymanski tells MailOnline. ‘A lot of my research has a strong correlation between wage spending and performance. ‘We also looked at things like nationality, whether they were a player or not, where they played and so on. ‘Over time 90% of variation in league position can be accounted for by the wage spending of the club. ‘Ferguson’s obviously a great manager, but he did have a lot of money so you need to take out the impact the money effect had. ‘That’s what this methodology allows you to do. 'Ferguson was the biggest over-achiever over the period that he was manager. 'You could have predicted he would be successful with money, maybe top five in the league. 'However they didn't come in the top five every season, they won it more often than not. 'You can take the difference between what an average manager would achieve with the money and the actual achievement with Ferguson, the ""Fergie difference"" if you like.' And it is possibly this 'Fergie difference' that ultimately led to the sacking of Moyes. To compile the data, Dr. Szymanski studied every manager in all four divisions of English football from 1974 to 2010. To qualify for the data a manager had to have been in charge for more than 30 games, which left a total of 528 managers. While Fergie tops the list, perhaps as expected, it is the positions of others that are of most interest. David Moyes, for example, comes in at 10th place thanks to his ‘success’ during his time at Everton. This was due to him overachieving with only limited amounts of money available. However, with his move to United Dr. Szymanski says he perhaps should have been a success at the club. In the list Jose Mourinho came in at a lowly 117th after his first spell at Chelsea. According to Dr. Szymanski this is due to him failing to over-achieve with 'boatloads of money' ‘Managers that are successful in the data tend to be at on average several clubs,’ he says. ‘Is Moyes an outlier? It’s a matter of too few observations.’ ‘I don’t think the number of games he was in charge at United is a good basis to judge his abilities as a manager. ‘I wonder if his sacking is not really more to do with politics than the performance of the club.’ He also points out that it may be difficult to update Moyes’ record as his stint at United was so brief. ‘We’re talking about tracking managers over tens of thousands of games over a 40-year period,’ he explains. ‘So one manager being fired on one day is not a very big event in our database. ‘What we’re trying to do is look what is generally true. ‘Moyes is a good manager and I think everybody acknowledges that. ‘He had tremendous success with Everton – my take is he wasn’t given a chance at United. ‘Surely he would need two or three years in the job to begin to assess if he could have done a job at the club in the long term. ‘Fergie went three years without winning anything. ‘What happened in the last year tells us nothing.’","New research has tracked the success of managers over the last 40 years .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Teaching kids to ride a bike is a tricky business. And showing them how to brake and stop can be equally challenging. But now a company has designed a new product that can stop them riding into danger with an automatic brake. Scroll down for video . The MiniBrake, pictured, is a device designed to keep your child safe by slowing their bike to a stop . Called MiniBrake, the $80 (£50)  device is a remote-controlled bike brake system. It is composed of two parts, a remote control for the parent and a small brake on the rear of the bike. Using the control, a parent can stop their kid heading for danger. The product, the company claims, brings the bike to a safe and smooth stop. This ensures that, even if travelling at speed, ‘your kid will not fall over when the brake is applied,’ they say on their Indiegogo crowdfunding page . The makers must raise $75,000 (£45,000) in order for production of the device to begin, however. The brake stops the bike when a parent presses the button on the remote control or when it goes out of range. When switching on the product, it automatically tests itself for right operation. The product automatically stops the bicycle when the batteries run out. When reaching the 164ft (50m) range, the product automatically stops the bicycle . As an extra safety measure, when anything blocks the signal . between the remote control and the bike, the brake is automatically . applied. A moving bike is safely and smoothly stopped approximately within 20in (50cm). The product automatically switches off when the bike is not in use to . avoid batteries running out of power due to an unswitched button. The product contains a 'black box', which logs all braking events. To install the device an Allen key is needed to screw it onto the back of small bicycles. A simple friction brake is then raised or lowered to slow the bike. The brake is lowered when the parent pushes the button on the remote control if, for example, they feel their kid is heading for danger. The range of the brake is 50 metres (164 feet) but, if this is exceeded, the brake is automatically applied to prevent the child riding off. In addition, if the brake runs out of battery it will stay attached to the wheel so that the bike can’t be ridden any more. They say it is suitable for children up to a weight of 77lb (35kg). ‘Throughout the development and testing phases, we have consulted with moms, dads and their kids to make MiniBrake the perfect child safety product,’ the company says. ‘Children aged two to five are learning new skills extremely fast. ‘However, sometimes they are quicker in learning how to ride the bike than they are in perceiving dangerous situations. When the button is pressed (left) the brake is applied (middle) and the bike comes to a halt (right) ‘Or even if they notice a threat, they are not skilled enough to avoid accidents and stop safely. ‘Thus, parents often feel that while riding the bike is super fun, they must protect their children at all times. ‘Helmets, elbow- and knee protectors are extremely useful, but they can only mitigate the effect of a collision – in contrast, MiniBrake is used to avoid bike accidents. ‘MiniBrake is a unique solution that actively prevents accidents. ‘With the help of a simple remote controller, parents can intervene and stop their kids in order to avoid bike accidents. The company is now seeking funding and beginning production of the product, with it expected to roll out in May.","The MiniBrake device is designed to stop bike wheels turning .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From the boring status updates to the relentless sharing of cat videos and baby photos, there are many reasons to 'unfriend' people on Facebook. But the most common reason for culling a virtual friendship is polarising opinions about religion and politics, according to a new study. Adults are most likely to unfriend acquaintances from school, which could be because people’s views change – and become more extreme in some cases – over the years so they have less in common than they did. Friendship culled: The study suggests that adults are most likely to unfriend acquaintances from high school, which could be because people's views change ' and become more extreme in some cases - over the years so they have less in common than they did . ‘The most common reason for unfriending someone from high school is that the person posted polarising comments often about religion or politics,' said Christopher Sibona, a doctoral student in computer science at the University of Colorado, Denver. Unsurprisingly, ‘the other big reason for unfriending was frequent, uninteresting posts,’ he said. His first study examined unfriending behaviours on the social network and involved a survey of 1,077 people on Twitter. The study found that the top five kinds of people are unfriended are: High school friends, ‘other’, a friend of a friend, work colleagues and ‘common interest friends.’ Mr Sibona said: ‘We found that people often unfriend co-workers for their actions in the real world rather than anything they post on Facebook.’ The most common reason for unfriending someone from high school is that the person posted polarising comments often about religion or politics, said Christopher Sibona, of the University of Colorado, Denver. People's reactions to being unfriended (illustrated) ranged from upset to surprised, the study found . The study found that the top five kinds . of people are unfriended are: . One reason he believes high school friends are top targets for unfriending is that their political and religious beliefs may not have been as strong when they were younger. And if those beliefs have grown more strident over time, it becomes easier to offend others. ‘Your high school friends may not know your current political or religious beliefs and you may be quite vocal about them…one thing about social media is that online disagreements escalate much more quickly,’ he said. The second of his studies looked at the emotional impact of being unfriended and he discovered that the most common responses were: ‘I was surprised’, ‘It bothered me,’ ‘I was amused’ and ‘I felt sad’. Mr Sibona said: ‘The strongest predictor is how close you were at the peak of your friendship when the unfriending happened. You may be more bothered and saddened if your best friend unfriends you.’ One less friend: The second study looked at the emotional impact of being unfriended and said that the most common responses ranged from amusement to sadness.The study found that people were more likely to be emotionally affected by the action is they were close friends or closely monitored their list of friends . The study unsurprisingly found that people were more likely to be emotionally affected by the action if they were close friends or closely monitored their list of friends. The work suggests that people would be less negatively affected if difficulties were discussed between friends before the unfriending and if the person unfriended talked about it with others after the unfriending. The research found that unfriending happens more often to friends who were once close than to those who are acquaintances. ‘Despite the preponderance of weak ties throughout online social networks, these findings help to place unfriending within the greater context of relationship dissolution,’ the study said. The two studies were published in the 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences and anyone who would like to be involved in his next wave of research investigating why people leave Facebook, can take an anonymous survey. Facebook can boost our political leanings dramatically - and cause us to ignore friends we don't agree with, researchers have claimed. A Georgia Institute of Technology study found users tend to stick in their own circles and become more polarised. It also claimed Facebook's own algorithms should be tweaked to make more partisan stories appear. 'People are mainly friends with those who share similar values and interests. They tend to interact with them the most, a phenomenon called homophily,' said Catherine Grevet, the Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who led the study. 'But that means they rarely interact with the few friends with differing opinions. As a result, they aren’t exposed to opposing viewpoints.' People who think the majority of their friends have differing opinions than their own engage less on Facebook, the researchers discovered. For those who choose to stay logged in and politically active, the research found that most tend to stick in their own circles, ignore those on the other side and become more polarised. The study also found Facebook may be partly to blame - as its algorithms learn what we like. Ms Grevet suggests that the social media site should sprinkle in a few status updates on both sides of political issues.","Study found the top five kinds of people who are unfriended are: school friends, other, a friend of a friend, colleagues and 'common interest friends'

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . I have . seen Bernie Ecclestone reduce grown men to giggling sycophancy. It is . not intimidation that does it – at least not in my experience – but . charm. He is only 5ft 3in in his socks but he has a charisma that fills a . room. Hearing the evidence he gave this week in Munich at the start of a five-month bribery trial that may strip him of his sport, as well as his liberty, I was reminded of this knack. Asked whether he was divorced or married, he replied: ‘Both.’ I can envisage his usual squinting look of befuddlement and hear his dead-pan, sotto voce delivery. ‘I like to remember the divorce bit,’ he added with emphasis. Humour, usually in the form of a one-liner, has been one of his great weapons through the 60 years and more in which he transformed himself into a billionaire. An eye for a deal is another obvious part of the arsenal. D-day: Bernie Ecclestone arrives at court as he faces trial in Germany . No laughing matter: Ecclestone is flanked by his lawyers as he arrives at court in Munich . His line in Munich took me back to the High Court in London at the end of last year. There, he was asked about the hypothetical idea of paying millions to buy off a blackmailer who alleged erroneously that he had cheated on his ex-wife, Slavica. Pressed on whether he would really do that, he said: ‘You haven’t met my wife.’ While we’re on the subject of Ecclestone’s wit, here is what he told me in 2012 about his daughter Petra’s £5million wedding: 'I had to do something at the time that upset me. I had to give her away. I’d rather have sold her.’ In the same interview, I asked him when he thought he would hand over Formula One. ‘Past 100, I’m definitely out,’ he said. ‘I don’t know who should do it – honestly there’s nobody I despise enough that I would wish this on them.’ Asked on another occasion when his autobiography would be published, he responded: ‘The morning after I die. And the first 12 copies will go to the Inland Revenue.’ Last month when asked what he thought of the quieter new engine noise, he said he would like the sound to be louder, before adding Frankie Howerd-style: ‘I wish I could get it up.’ Not everyone will find all the jokes to his or her taste. Fine. They are often distinctly un-PC. Certainly, the next two examples will offend many sensibilities but I include them to give a true flavour of the man. Asked about the merits of having a female driver in Formula One, he opined: ‘What I would really like is to find the right girl, perhaps a black girl with super looks, preferably Jewish or Muslim, who speaks Spanish.’ And questioned about Danica Patrick, who made her name racing in America, he said: ‘You know, I’ve got one of these wonderful ideas that women should all be dressed in white like all the other domestic appliances.’ Humour: Ecclestone is well known for his wit and one-liners . In fairness, he could laugh at himself as easily as others. After being mugged, he posed, his face black and blue, for a watch advert under the banner: ‘See what people will do for a Hublot.’ (I’m not counting his remark that he admired Hitler for being ‘able to get things done’ as a quip; he actually meant that one.) Bernie Ecclestone has said and done many stupid things, he has looked old-fashioned and, to some minds, bigoted, yet his sense of mischief has unmistakably drawn in many people. In the early days his charm opened doors for him, a second-hand car dealer, to play chemmy with the likes of Cubby Broccoli, Lord Beaverbrook and, at least once, Lord Lucan. It enabled him to do deals nobody else had the chutzpah to attempt. And it means he still has a direct line in to presidents, prime ministers, small-town dictators, titans of industry, the good, the bad and the dangerous. Paddock power: Ecclestone remains in charge of Formula One despite his advancing years . But, as he learned when Mr Justice Newey published his scathing judgment in the previous High Court hearing, the quips do not make a jot of difference in the legal matters at hand, namely whether he bribed a German banker to sell the sport at a reduced price so he could continue running it. That is why it is best for him that he will not be giving evidence directly in Munich, but only through his lawyers. For once, it’s not jokes that can save Bernie. There has been discussion, including on the Daily Mail’s back page, about when precisely Ecclestone’s absolute control over Formula One was irretrievably broken. Having to stand down from the F1 board to fight charges in Germany was a big moment. So, too, was the verdict of Mr Justice Newey, who, to elaborate on the item above, found in Ecclestone’s favour on a technicality but condemned his evidence as unreliable. Might I suggest another significant moment, which has yet to materialise? It is when he no longer decides who gets a paddock pass, the entree to the sport’s inner sanctum. It is said that even Donald Mackenzie, chairman of CVC, the sport’s owners, is beholden to Bernie’s patronage on this one. He who hands out the passes, holds the power. A thought to ponder as we approach next week’s 20th anniversary commemoration of Ayrton Senna’s death. Many rank the brilliant Brazilian as the finest of all drivers; he is certainly a contender for the accolade. But I wonder whether, in general, those who survived their careers should not be granted greater recognition than those who perished. Remembered: Ayrton Senna was killed 20 years ago next week . Memories: Pictures of Senna are seen on a fence at the site where he died at the race track in Imola . After all, in eras past, survival was the ultimate achievement. As well as luck, it took skill to live – to assemble a dependable team around you, to feel impending malfunction before it killed you, to ensure you ran off the track as infrequently as possible. Discuss. One piece of vaguely Senna-related trivia. Lewis Hamilton went behind his dad’s car to cry when he heard his idol was dead, so one might think his helmet has been yellow for most of his career in homage to Senna. No so. He was told to wear yellow so his fretful father could spot him among fellow young karters. Nonetheless, what chance Lewis returning to a full yellow helmet as a mark of respect to Senna at the next race, in Spain? It would be a heartfelt touch. Yellow is the colour: Lewis Hamilton wore such a helmet so his dad could spot him when he was younger .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . How did the mountain known as Mount Sharp come to be in the centre of the Gale Crater on Mars, and just how habitable was this area in the past? That's what the team operating Nasa's Curiosity rover will be hoping to discover after spending the weekend inspecting a potential drilling site. The site contains a sandstone slab known as Windjana, named after a gorge in Western Australia, that could provide much-needed answers to some intriguing questions about life on Mars. This image, taken at the end of last week with the Curiosity rover's Mast Camera (Mastcam), shows a sandstone slab at the centre. The rover team has spent the weekend getting Curiosity to examine a target patch on the rock, called 'Windjana,' with a view to studying it further . If . this target meets criteria set by engineers and scientists, it could . become the mission's third drilled rock - and the first to be carried . out on sandstone, rather than mudstone. From . planned drilling at Windjana, Curiosity's science team hopes to analyse the cement that . holds together the sand-size grains in the rock - and learn more about the habitability of the region. The planned inspection, designed to aid a decision on whether to drill at Windjana, includes observations with the camera and X-ray spectrometer at the end of the rover's arm. A brush to remove dust from a patch on the rock was also used, and readings of composition at various points on the rock were made using an instrument that fires laser shots from the rover's mast. The . spectrometer on the rover's robotic arm is the Alpha Particle X-Ray . Spectrometer (APXS), which was provided by the Canadian Space Agency. The camera on the arm is the Mars Hand Lens Imager (Mahli), built and operated by Malin Space Science Systems, San Diego. The . laser on the mast is part of the Chemistry and Camera instrument . (ChemCam), from the U.S. Department of Energy's Los Alamos National . Laboratory in New Mexico and the French national space agency, CNES. The rover's wire-bristle brush, the Dust Removal Tool, was built by Honeybee Robotics, New York. Curiosity's hammering drill collects powdered sample material from the interior of a rock, and then the rover prepares and delivers portions of the sample to onboard lab instruments. The first two Martian rocks drilled and analysed this way were mudstone slabs neighbouring each other in Yellowknife Bay, about 2.5 miles (4 kilometres) northeast of the rover's current location at a waypoint called ‘the Kimberley.’ Those two rocks yielded evidence of an ancient lakebed environment with key chemical elements, and a chemical energy source that provided conditions billions of years ago favourable for microbial life. It is hoped Windjana could provide similar information into the previous habitability of Mars. ‘We want to learn more about the wet process that turned sand deposits into sandstone here,’ said Curiosity Project Scientist John Grotzinger, of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. ‘What was the composition of the fluids that bound the grains together? That aqueous chemistry is part of the habitability story we're investigating.’ The target is on the approximately two-foot-wide (60 centimetres) rock seen in the right half of this view. The sandstone target's informal name comes from Windjana Gorge in Western Australia.  If this target meets criteria set by scientists, it could become the mission's third drilled rock and the first that is not mudstone . This view is an excerpt from an 11 April 2014 observation by Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. In the lower centre of the screen, by the red dot, is 'Mount Remarkable' that stands 16 ft (5m) high, with Windjana nearby. Curiosity appears as the bright blue object at the two-o'clock position relative to the dot . Understanding why some sandstones in the area are harder than others also could help explain major shapes of the landscape where Curiosity is working inside Gale Crater. Erosion-resistant sandstone forms a capping layer of mesas - hills shaped like table-tops - and buttes - isolated hills with steep sides and flat tops. It could even hold hints about why Gale Crater has a large layered mountain, Mount Sharp, at its centre. Nasa’s Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) project is using Curiosity to assess ancient habitable environments and major changes in Martian environmental conditions. Over the weekend Curiosity extended its arm to Windjana to ascertain whether it is worthwhile drilling there. The rock is within a waypoint location called 'the Kimberley,' where sandstone outcrops with differing resistance to wind erosion result in a stair-step pattern of layers . The team must now decide if the rock, pictured, is worthy of further study. Drilling operations can take weeks to plan and execute, which is why so much preparation is needed. Ultimately this seemingly inconspicuous sandstone could explain how Mount Sharp, Curiosity's ultimate destination, formed in the Gale Crater . The Curiosity rover, pictured, landed on Mars on 6 August 2012 and has been exploring its fascinating surroundings ever since. Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of Caltech, built the rover and manages the project for Nasa's Science Mission Directorate in Washington .","Curiosity has spent the weekend inspecting a sandstone slab on Mars .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The frustration of losing your mobile phone could soon be a thing of the past thanks to new technology that could print it on a T-shirt. Scientists have designed the world's first 'spaser' - a nanoscale laser - made out of graphene and carbon. They claim the spaser is so small it will be used to print tiny microchips that can be attached to T-shirts or other items of clothing, and used to power mobile phones. Scientists have designed the world's first 'spaser' - a nanoscale laser - made out of graphene and carbon. Artist's impression pictured. They claim the spaser is so small it will be used to print nanoscale microchips which can then be attached to clothing and other flexible surfaces . The electrical current in the technology could even be used to target and kill cancer cells within the human body. 'Other spasers are made of gold or silver nanoparticles and semiconductor quantum dots,' said lead researcher Chanaka Rupasinghe, from Monash University Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering in Melbourne, Australia. A spaser (surface plasmon amplication by stimulated emission of radiation) is effectively a nanoscale laser, or a nanonlaser. It has been touted as the future of optical computers and technologies. It could enable â€˜nanophotonicâ€™ circuitry, extremely small circuits far tinier than anything available today. This could usher in many technological advances including hyperlenses, which could lead to microscopes ten times more powerful than anything we have today. 'Our device would be comprised of a graphene resonator and a carbon nanotube gain element.' 'The use of carbon means our spaser would be more robust and flexible, would operate at high temperatures, and be eco-friendly. 'Because of these properties, there is the possibility that in the future an extremely thin mobile phone could be printed on clothing.' At present spasers are used to make microprocessors, memories and screens smaller, and more portable. However the new spaser, made using graphene and carbon nanotubes, would be over a hundred times stronger than steel and is a better conductor than copper. It can also withstand extremely high temperatures. Researchers found that graphene and carbon nanotubes can transfer energy to each other through light, and as a result could be used to create a high-tech substitute for microchips. The research claims that as mobile phone technology becomes smaller and more efficient, it could be embedded into our clothes, along with these nanoscale microchips and other circuitry. Stock image pictured . 'Graphene and carbon nanotubes can be used in applications where you need strong, lightweight, conducting, and thermally stable materials due to their outstanding mechanical, electrical and optical properties. 'They have been tested as nanoscale antennas, electric conductors and waveguides,' continued Rupasinghe. Researchers also hope the new spaser could be used in cancer research as a new way of destroying cancer cells, as the electric field generated by the spaser can destroy them without harming healthy ones. Rupasinghe said: 'Scientists have already found ways to guide nanoparticles close to cancer cells. 'We can move graphene and carbon nanotubes following those techniques and use the high concentrate fields generated through the spasing phenomena to destroy individual cancer cells without harming the healthy cells in the body.'","World's first carbon-only nanoscale laser has been designed in Australia .

"By . Mark Prigg . Facebook has been given U.S. antitrust approval to buy Oculus VR in a $2bn deal, the Federal Trade Commission has revealed. Facebook said on March 25 that it planned to buy Oculus for $2 billion in its first-ever hardware deal. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said at the time that the proposed transaction reflected his company's desire to bet on 'the platforms of tomorrow'. Scroll down for video . The future of Facebook? The Oculus Rift headset in action. Facebook today bought the firm for $2bn . MailOnline was able to try Oculus Rift at the CES show in Las Vegas earlier this year. At first we were skeptical - the headset looks bulky, although it is surprisingly light when  attached via straps. However, once our demo started, doubts were quickly forgotten. The technology, still just a developer's version, is breathtakingly good. While the resolution still doesn't give the feeling of quite being in the real world, it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world. During several demonstrations we entered a vast dungeon and flew through space, with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as the user's head moves. It's not quite ready for primetime yet, but is almost there - and the Oculus Rift headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality. The deal was on a list of several proposed transactions that have been cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice and FTC. The Oculus buy was one of several high-profile purchases by Facebook, which recently won antitrust approval to acquire Whatsapp, an instant messaging service for smartphones, for $19 billion. It also bought the photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012. The social network announced last month it had reached a definitive agreement to acquire Oculus VR, a California firm founded by 21 year old college dropout Palmer Luckey. 'Mobile is the platform of today, and now we're also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow,' said Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg at the time. 'It's different from anything I've every experienced in my life.' The firm is among the most advanced in the VR field, and recently began taking orders for the latest version of its $350 developers version. 'Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,' said Zuckerberg. 'Immersive gaming will be the first, and Oculus already has big plans here that won't be changing and we hope to accelerate. 'The Rift is highly anticipated by the gaming community, and there's a lot of interest from developers in building for this platform. 'We're going to focus on helping Oculus build out their product and develop partnerships to support more games. 'Oculus will continue operating independently within Facebook to achieve this. 'But this is just the start. 'After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. 'Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face - just by putting on goggles in your home.' The $2bn deal includes $400 million in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook common stock. 'Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate,' said Mark Zuckerberg, pictured . Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers, having received more than 75,000 orders for development kits for the company's virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift. Facebook said 'While the applications for virtual reality technology beyond gaming are in their nascent stages, several industries are already experimenting with the technology, and Facebook plans to extend Oculus' existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas.' Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers 'The Matrix - that's always been the dream,' said one Oculus Rift executive of its headset, pictured . The Oculus prototype, pictured, is packed with components - many of which Mark Zuckerberg claims can be found in a mobile phone, making the gadget relatively easy to produce . 'We are excited to work with Mark and the Facebook team to deliver the very best virtual reality platform in the world,' said Brendan Iribe, co-founder and CEO of Oculus VR. 'We believe virtual reality will be heavily defined by social experiences that connect people in magical, new ways. Palmer Luckey of Oculus . 21-year-old Palmer Luckey began Oculus when he was just 15, working on prototypes in his parent's garage. He started developing his own head-mounted VR displays when he was still in high school, and was in college when he created the first prototype of a consumer-priced VR headset called the Oculus Rift - although he eventually left to work on the project full time. MailOnline met Luckey at the CES show in Las Vegas, where he showed an incredible amount of enthusiasm for the product. He said he believed the technology's time had come. The firm originally turned to Kickstarter to raise money, but has since raised funds from investors across silicon Valley - until it was today bought by Facebook for $2bn. 'It is a transformative and disruptive technology, that enables the world to experience the impossible, and it's only just the beginning.' Oculus recently raised $75m to make the headset. 'Over the past 16 months, weâ€™ve grown from a startup to a company whose technology is poised to change the way we play, work and communicate,' said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus VR at the time.","Oculus founded by 21 year old college dropout Palmer Luckey .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . If you’re hoping for the halcyon days of gaming to be given a virtual reality reboot, look no further than Oculus Rift. The headset, which continues to seemingly lead the way in the fight for the emerging VR market, has been used to take a fresh look at Sonic the Hedgehog. And now, in this rather stomach-churning video, you can experience all the loops, jumps and speed of Sonic in glorious first-person. Scroll down for video . Youtube user Chadtronic has unveiled his first-person Sonic the Hedgehog game that utilises the virtual reality Oculus Rift device. In the game the player can look around in the virtual world using the headset while moving with a controller, with the experience likened to riding a rollercoaster . The game uses something known as Sonic GDK. This is a collection of source code that makes it possible for fan-created Sonic games to be designed. The ones in this video were made using the Unreal Engine 3. ‘This is one of those games where if you kind of get woozy on those rollercoasters in theme parks I recommend you probably stay away from this one,’ YouTube user Chadtronic said in his video. ‘But besides that it’s extremely fun.’ In the video, the gamer is shown using the headset to ‘look around’ as they play. This . enables them to move towards obstacles, loops and jumps while using a . controller to input commands. Sonic is known for his speed and quick . movements, as well as his iconic look.

They programmed the headset to experience internet lag in real life, to give users an idea of what it would be like to live in a world where things buffer like an online video. The experiment is called 'Living with lag' and sees four volunteers going through activities while using an Oculus Rift together with a Rasperry Pi, webcam and noise-cancelling headphones. Together, this combination can simulate different levels of lag, from a brief 0.33 seconds to a more frustrating three seconds. The results are rather hilariously shown in their video, which includes the volunteers struggling to dance and play table tennis.","A gamer has used the Oculus Rift to create a first-person Sonic game .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Passengers on board a Ryanair flight to Tenerife were encouraged to play a 'rowdy toilet roll throwing game' to win free booze, according to a holidaymaker. Cabin crew allegedly split rows of people into two teams and told to hurl the rolls as far as they could in order to claim alcohol - hitting other passengers in the face in the process. The 20-minute game took place on board a flight from Manchester to Tenerife, on which elderly holidaymakers were travelling. Scroll down for video . On board games: Ryanair passengers were allegedly encouraged by to play a rowdy toilet roll tossing game on a flight to Tenerife . Complaint: A passenger on board the budget airline flight has said he will make a complaint . Music promoter and DJ Chris Prudence, 29, from Wirral, said he will be making a complaint to the budget airline after claiming 'all hell broke loose' on board the four-hour, 25-minute flight on Easter Sunday. Rows of passengers were divided into two teams by a male member of the cabin crew and played six or seven rounds in a desperate bid to win a 'free bar'. Mr Prudence said: 'I was sitting in my seat minding my own business when this blaring voice said whichever team managed to get a toilet roll to the back of a plane first won. Free booze game: Passengers were promised alcohol if they won the game on board a Ryanair flight to Manchester . 'The prize was a free bar which meant free alcoholic drinks to a flight full of lads and holidaymakers. 'But there were elderly people on board who just wanted quiet. 'There were all these hands in the air flailing wildly as this bundle, which was quite heavy, made its way to down the aisles to the back of the plane. 'I wasn't playing the game and the toilet roll hit me and a poor pensioner who was nodding off when the roll bashed into her face.' After the game finished, cabin crew admitted that there was no free alcohol on board flight 4332. On board brawl: Last month, a hen party was involved in a fight on board a Ryanair flight to Barcelona . Mr Prudence added: 'The clown who worked for Ryanair said he was just joking after all that nonsense. I was furious.' He is planning to complain to Ryanair because of their 'unprofessionalism and disregard for the well-being of its passengers'. It comes after last month, bride-to-be Kelly Lloyd, 30 was involved in a mid-air hen party brawl with her bridesmaid Katrina Hanafin, 33 during a flight from Manchester to Barcelona. And in February, disturbing footage of furious passengers kept on a grounded Ryanair flight for 11 hours emerged on YouTube. Police were eventually called because cabin crew would not allow the exasperated passengers to leave the plane. The airline later apologised for the fiasco. A spokesman for Ryanair denied the claims. 'This 'free bar' story is totally untrue,' they said. 'There was no offer of a ""free bar"" on this or any other Ryanair flight and no free drinks were dispensed. 'Cabin crew were interacting with our customers and arranged a pass the parcel competition, but this was in a spirit of good fun (which Ryanair crews are encouraged to do). 'The vast majority of our customers on this flight enjoyed this light-hearted fun and complimented the crew who were professional and attentive to our customers at all times during this four-hour 25-minute flight. 'While we are both surprised and regret that Mr Prudence, a 29-year-old DJ, may not have enjoyed this brief bit of fun, his claims of a ""free bar"", a ""quite heavy bundle"" and ""unprofessionalism"" are simply untrue.'","Passenger to complain after toilet roll hit him in the face during flight .

"By . Neil Sears . Comedian Freddie Starr has launched a £300,000 defamation claim against one of the women who exposed Jimmy Savile as a paedophile. The 70-year-old claims that Karin Ward's allegations that he assaulted her nearly 40 years ago have cost him a small fortune in cancelled bookings. Starr was arrested after cancer sufferer Miss Ward, 55, claimed on television that he groped her in Savile's dressing room after appearing on the shamed DJ's TV show Clunk Click in 1974 when she was 15. Karin Ward in yellow sitting behind Freddie Starr when he appeared on the BBC TV show Clunk Click hosted by Jimmy Savile . Miss Ward's testimony against Savile was one of the key factors in triggering the investigation into his past. She spoke on camera in the ITV documentary which first revealed Savile's abuse, focusing on how he preyed on her and fellow pupils at Duncroft approved school for girls in Staines, Surrey. But Starr – who is furious that police have not decided whether to charge him – claims that her additional claims that he molested her are untrue and defamatory, and have cost him more than £300,000 in cancelled theatre bookings. In a highly unusual case, he has lodged a legal claim at the High Court, detailing repeated occasions when he claims she blackened his name as a paedophile. Starr was first arrested last November by the Operation Yewtree squad which is investigating claims of historic sexual abuse sparked by the Savile revelations. He was rearrested in April over further allegations and last month police handed a file on his case to the Crown Prosecution Service. Karin Ward (left) was sexually abused by Jimmy Savile and went on to claim she was groped by Freddie Starr (right) - an allegation he has denied . In his claim, he maintains his innocence of all charges, describing himself as 'a famous comedian and entertainer who has been active in showbusiness for over 40 years'. The father of five says Miss Ward's attacks on him began in the ITV documentary Exposure: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile, which was broadcast in October 2012. In it, she said: 'I was horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie Starr, who had a very bad attack of wandering hands and had groped me, and I didn't like him because he smelled like my step-father and it frightened me and freaked me out, and I rebuffed him and he humiliated me in front of everyone in the dressing room.' Starr, who lives near Studley, Warwickshire, denies any such sexual assault at the Clunk Click recording, humiliating or frightening her, or being a paedophile. His claim also says Miss Ward was libelling him when she told a BBC journalist: 'Other guests on the show clearly saw girls and, well, kids, male and female, as being there to be used. Karin Ward was just one of the hundreds of Jimmy Savile victims who came forward to tell police about his crimes . 'I had a famous person who would try, he smelled awful, he smelled of sweat and alcohol and it made me heave just to be near him, so I certainly didn't want him to do anything to me.' Starr also complains that Miss Ward published defamatory claims on an internet blog in which she wrote of visits with schoolmates to Savile's dressing room at the BBC over a period of several weeks. She wrote she met a number of celebrities, saying: 'Of those who had similar tastes to Jimmy Savile – a liking of under-age girls – I can only recall vague disgust and  horror. 'One particular celebrity, a very popular comedian of the time, whom I shall simply refer to as “F”, absolutely stank of booze and sweat. 'His hands wandered incessantly – he had absolutely no qualms about any one of the girls seeing what he was doing to any of the others. The fact that we sat in his dressing room with him, drinking vodka or Bacardi rum whilst he blatantly selected which girl to humiliate amazes me. 'I refused ""F"" because getting anywhere near him made me heave.' And in an autobiography produced to be read on Kindle-type devices, she said the comedian referred to as ""F"" 'was furious that I dared refuse him – he made an exceptionally cruel remark about my lack of breasts by way of getting back at me for refusing him. 'So that everyone could hear, he said loudly, ""I wouldn't touch you anyway, you're a ***less wonder!"". Everyone laughed whilst I burned with humiliation.' Starr's claim says he is easily identifiable because he was a popular comedian with the initial F, and Miss Ward had already named him on TV. He denies encouraging under-age girls to drink alcohol while choosing which to humiliate. He says he is due aggravated damages because Miss Ward sought a huge audience for her claims 'when, if there were any truth in her allegations, she should have reported them to the police'. He also claims she had refused to retract or apologise for the claims, despite his public denials – and seeks an injunction barring her from slurring him in future. Miss Ward, of Oswestry, Shropshire, was diagnosed with bowel cancer two years ago. She is a qualified legal secretary, but has rarely worked because of depression and anxiety. Last night, she could not be reached for comment. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Comedian claims that allegations have cost him a small fortune .

"By . Hugo Gye . Icon: British scientist Peter Higgs has given his name to the Higgs boson, but other physicists are pushing to change the particle's title . The discovery of the Higgs boson is one of the greatest scientific landmarks of recent years - but would it be so iconic if the particle were called Brout-Englert-Higgs, the SM Scalar boson or BEHGHK? Rival scientists have launched a campaign to rename the so-called 'God particle', claiming that British physicist Peter Higgs does not deserve all the credit for the breakthrough discovery. And while it may not seem to be a particularly burning issue, its importance is increased by the fact that this year's Nobel Prize could be riding on the outcome of the dispute. The Higgs boson, whose discovery was announced last year, is crucial to scientists' understanding of physics as it explains why particles have mass. Its existence was predicted in a 1964 paper by Professor Higgs, from Edinburgh University, and it has been known by his name ever since. He has long acknowledged that he is just one of six researchers involved in formulating the theory of the boson, and now one of the other scientists is lobbying for its name to be changed to reflect this, according to the Sunday Times. While most British institutions have dismissed the campaign as pointless given the popular fame of the Higgs boson, it has gained some traction abroad, with a conference in France trying to ban speakers from referring to the particle by its usual name. The most popular alternative name is 'Brout-Englert-Higgs', in homage to Belgian scientists Robert Brout and FranÃ§ois Englert, who published a paper on the topic shortly before Professor Higgs did so. Another possibility is to call it the 'BEHGHK' (pronounced 'berk'), taking account of the contribution by Gerald Guralnik, Carl Hagen and Tom Kibble, from Imperial College London. Discovery: A diagram of the experiment in smashing particles together which helped find the boson . Claim: Carl Hagen, who helped to predict the existence of the boson, wants more credit for his work . At a conference last month in Moriond in France, participants were asked to avoid the term 'Higgs boson' and call the particle the 'SM Scalar boson' instead. One of those campaigning to change the particle's name is Professor Hagen, 76, who said: 'It should not be called Higgs. 'The rest of us are fighting not just for our ego but for our place in the annals of physics.' Professor Englert, 80, has also joined the fight, saying he wanted to pay tribute to his colleague Professor Brout, who died in 2011. 'Higgs is the wrong name for this particle because the paper where the mechanism and structure was first set out was ours,' he told the Sunday Times. 'Maybe the name should not matter but it is not pleasant if you have done important work to be ignored.' Facility: The machinery at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland where the boson was discovered . The row over the name of the boson will take a more serious turn in October, when the particle's discoverers will be leading candidates to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. The prize, worth more than $1million, can be shared by up to three people, but it is currently unclear who might be eligible to receive the award alongside Professor Higgs, 83. Many scientists have resisted the push to change the name of the Higgs boson, pointing out that the physicist after whom it was named was the first to predict the existence of a previously unknown particle. Professor Kibble, 80, dismissed calls to acknowledge him and his colleagues by renaming the particle, saying: 'The name Higgs boson has been in common use for 40 years and it is silly to try to change it. 'There is no chance that any of the longer names on offer will ever be in everyday use.' Professor Higgs himself has not publicly commented on the controversy. The hunt for the boson was closely followed by the media and the public after the 17-mile-wide Large Hadron Collider was built in Switzerland at a cost of Â£6.2billion in an attempt to find it. The announcement of its probable discovery in July last year seemed to confirm the validity of the 'Standard Model' of particle physics which has been built up over the past decades.","Higgs boson, discovered last year, is what gives particles their mass .

Yesterday a furious Miss Ward said she would repeat her claims on oath – and that even if he won, she had nothing worth taking. ‘He can sue me, take everything I haven’t got – that’s fine, I couldn’t care less,’ she told  the Daily Mail. ‘What can he do  to me? My house is rented, my car is worth £25. ‘What’s he going to do – have me declared bankrupt?’ The mother of seven last year spoke on camera in the ITV documentary that brought Savile’s abuse to public attention. She also claimed on the programme that Starr had ‘wandering hands’ and had groped her in the dressing room of Savile’s Clunk Click TV show when she was 15. Starr, 70, initially denied appearing on the show or meeting her. When footage emerged showing her standing behind him on Clunk Click, he was forced to admit he was ‘mistaken’ but still denied the ‘awful allegation’ of abuse. Miss Ward has also recounted in an internet blog and her self- published autobiography how a comedian referred to as ‘F’ had hands which ‘wandered incessantly’. She wrote that ‘F’ was furious when she rebuffed him and made an ‘exceptionally cruel remark about my lack of breasts’, namely: ‘I wouldn’t touch you anyway, you’re a ***less wonder!’ Starr – who has not been charged over allegations of historic sexual abuse – has now launched a legal claim accusing her of defaming him as a paedophile. In a highly unusual move, the father of five – who maintains  his innocence of the claims – is seeking £300,000 to cover lost  theatre bookings as well as an injunction to stop Miss Ward repeating her allegations. On film: The 55-year old is in yellow sitting behind Starr during an appearance on BBC TV show Clunk Click in 1974, hosted by Jimmy Savile. At her housing association home in Oswestry, Shropshire, yesterday, Miss Ward, whose car is a 15-year-old Vauxhall Astra, said she stood by all her claims about Starr but insisted she had never called him a paedophile. ‘I wasn’t upset because he attempted to grope me,’ she said. ‘That’s what men did, you could walk down the street and have your bottom pinched. ‘It was normal behaviour for men to grab your boobs – that’s not what upset me. Denial: Starr, 70, initially said he did not appear on the show and claimed to have not met Miss Ward . ‘What upset me was the fact that when I recoiled he called me a “***less wonder” and everybody howled with laughter.’ Miss Ward said she had told police interviewing her about Savile that she did not want to make a complaint against Starr. She added: ‘At no point have I said he’s a paedophile or accused him of any sexual offences.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Karin Ward is facing a High Court defamation claim for £300,000 .

"By . Stephen Wright . A top BBC presenter has been arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile scandal. Officers from Operation Yewtree have refused to name the suspect, 64, who still works at the BBC and is a household name. The BBC, the suspect and his agent have all refused to confirm his identity. Star: A presenter from the BBC, whose London Broadcasting House headquarters are pictured, has apparently been arrested on suspicion of historic sex offences. But the Corporation has refused to reveal his identity . The situation provoked a new row about . so-called ‘secret arrests’. Critics say that refusing to name arrested . suspects means innocent people are falsely linked to high-profile . arrests by Yewtree officers. And yesterday an innocent entertainer of the same age was widely named on the internet as the person who had been arrested. But despite the potential damage to . the man’s reputation, the Metropolitan Police and BBC both refused to . confirm the identity of the man who had really been arrested. Shami Chakrabarti, director of human . rights group Liberty, criticised the decision not to publicise the . star’s identity, saying it was ‘chilling for officers to refuse to . confirm names of those detained or charged’. Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the . Commons culture committee, said: ‘My view is people should be named, . particularly for sex offences, and one of the reasons is that it could . encourage other potential victims to come forward.’ He added: ‘I don’t . want to live in a country where the police go around arresting people . secretly and quietly. The fact that they name people is an important . safeguard.’ Arrests: Two more people have been arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, which was set up in response to the crimes of Jimmy Savile, pictured . The BBC star who was arrested was one . of two people detained on Tuesday morning after police swooped on two . separate addresses in South London. The pair are the 15th and 16th people . to have been arrested under Operation Yewtree, which was set up to . investigate claims of sex abuse carried out by DJ Savile and others. The . identity of the other suspect, who is 74, has also been kept secret. According to reports, a witness said . that police arrested the 64-year-old star at 5am on Tuesday, and were . seen removing material from his home. The witness added that the . celebrity was easily recognisable, saying: ‘There’s no doubt who it . was.’ When the star’s name was put to the . Met on Wednesday, it refused to confirm his identity. A Scotland Yard . spokesman said: ‘We are not prepared to give a running commentary on the . investigation. We don’t discuss names. We never have done.’ But the Yard indicated in a statement . that the man is not suspected of committing offences with paedophile . Savile, saying he came under the strand of the investigation dubbed . ‘others’. Suspect: David Smith, a former BBC chauffeur, has been found dead shortly before he was due to face trial . The BBC said it was unable to comment . on the arrest. But it later confirmed that there were no plans, at . present, to take the star off air. A radio programme featuring him is . scheduled to be broadcast in the next week. Entertainer Rolf Harris, former Radio 1 . DJ Dave Lee Travis and PR consultant Max Clifford are among the high . profile figures already arrested and charged with sex offences following . Operation Yewtree. They all deny wrongdoing.

"By . James Tozer . Ryanair was yesterday accused of spoiling passengers’ holidays by  hitting them with ‘sneaky’ and often huge charges at the airport. Mother-of-two Suzy McLeod had to pay £236 just to print out boarding passes for her family so they could return home. The 35-year-old was backed by more than 350,000 people on Facebook after complaining of her ‘unfair’ treatment. Hit with charges: Suzy McLeod, pictured with her children Harry and Mary, was charged £236 by Ryanair after she forgot to print her family's boarding cards . An Army officer, who has served in . Iraq and Afghanistan, told how he ended up leaving behind £44 worth of . gifts for his three children after being told it would cost £50 for a . second item of hand luggage. The 50-year-old’s plea that he was on a surprise trip to France to join them for a rare family holiday failed to move staff. Mrs McLeod, of Newbury, Berkshire, . fell foul of Ryanair’s rule that travellers print their own boarding . passes up to two weeks before flying. Because her family was in Spain . over 15 days from August 1, she was unable to do this. She did, . however,  have the passes on her phone as pdf documents. Ryanair rant: The mother says that she was unable to print her boarding passes as she left the country before she was allowed to access them online . Print or pay: The airline say that their terms and conditions make it clear there is a penalty for reissuing passes . At Alicante airport, she was charged . 60 euros each, a total of 300 euros (£236) to print out five passes for . herself, her parents and children, Harrison, ten, and Mary, three. The . soldier who had to abandon presents he had bought at Hamleys in . Stansted’s departure area said: ‘What annoyed me was that they were . letting people board with far bigger hand baggage than mine. ‘Does it really cost £50 to carry a plastic bag filled with toys? It’s very sneaky.’ The whereabouts of the toys, including cars and dinosaurs, is not known. Ryanair is known for one of the most strictly enforced baggage policies in the industry. It insists all of its charges are detailed in terms and conditions on booking.",Mother-of-two Suzy McLeod had to pay £236 just to print out boarding passes for her family so they could return home .
"By . Chris Greenwood, Crime Reporter . A veteran dealer was accused yesterday of selling fake paintings on an ‘industrial scale’ at some of Britain’s best known arts and antiques markets. Bill Harbord, 81, is suspected of earning hundreds of thousands of pounds from the sale of works purporting to be by highly collectible modern artists. A renowned German museum is warning tourists to avoid his paintings, which often come signed and with official-looking stamps. Pensioner Bill Harbord, 83, and his wife Enid, 80, have been accused of selling fake artwork worth hundreds of thousands of pounds from stalls in Portobello Road (pictured) and Covent Garden . Alarmed experts fear the sheer number of fakes passing through his hands could damage confidence in the already fragile market. Mr Harbord, who has been trading art for half a century, is a regular figure at markets in London’s Portobello Road and Covent Garden. Among the works he sells are copies of collages by Kurt Schwitters, one of Germany’s best-known modern artists, which can fetch up to £50,000 each. He has also sold watercolours similar to those by the French Fauvist painter Raoul Dufy and works with a startling likeness to those by Dutch painter Kees van Dongen. Mr Harbord is accused of suggesting to customers that the works are genuine, despite them only having price tags of up to £250. The forgeries include works such as this one by Kurt Schwitters. They often have signatures on the canvas and 'official' stamps on the back . Authentic paintings by some of the artists can fetch six-figure sums, with one Dugy selling at auction last year for £315,000. A museum in Hanover recently issued an alert over more than 100 collages sold as genuine works, including some they believe were sold by Mr Harbord. Dr Isabel Schulz, the head of the Kurt Schwitters archive at the Sprengel Museum, said at least seven come from the pensioner’s stall. She told The Sunday Telegraph: ‘It is very worrying. I am really angry because they are using Schwitters’s name to make money and in doing so they are damaging his reputation.’ There are growing concerns about art fraud, with amateur buyers looking for a bargain caught out by ruthless dealers. Many forgers use recycle old canvases and frames, as well as using apparently official stamps and signatures, to give works an air of authenticity. Experts have said the flood of fakes in the art market and creates confusion over what works and artists can be trusted. Last week, a French institution ordered that a fake Marc Chagall painting, bought by a Leeds businessman in 1992 for £100,000, be burned. Mr Harbord, who works with his wife Enid, 80, told one investigator that a stamp on the back of a ‘Dufy’ indicates it could be genuine. He said: ‘It’s stamped on the back of the picture.’ Mrs Harbord added: ‘That is the gallery it was purchased from.’ Asked if it was real, Mr Harbord replied: ‘Yeah, of course.’ But confronted at his home in Herne Hill, South London, the dealer strongly denied any wrongdoing. ‘You are climbing up the wrong tree. I never, never [said they were real],' said Mr Harbord. ‘No I am sorry, we did not. I never said they were genuine, never, ever.’ Another artist Mr Harbord purports to stock is Raoul Dufy, whose genuine paintings (pictured) can sell for hundred of thousands of pounds at auction . He added: ‘Do they [customers] realistically think they can get a genuine article for that kind of price? ‘If you have someone who has lost £10,000 because of me, then you have something to write about.’ Art dealer Philip Mould, who presents BBC One’s Fake or Fortune, said passing off fakes and the real thing damages the entire industry. He said: ‘The industrial-scale production of these fakes has a wearing effect on people’s perception of the art world. It damages confidence.’ Sue Jones, of Westminster City Council’s trading standards department, said the trader faces a formal investigation. ‘This looks and sounds like it could potentially be a breach of fair trading legislation,’ she said. ‘If people are being falsely led to believe they are buying a genuine article when it is anything but genuine, that is a con. We will be looking into this.’","Bill Harbord, 82, has stall in Portobello Road and Covent Garden .

"By . Emma Thomas . A woman has told of her ordeal in a Dubai prison after being imprisoned for having sex outside marriage. Rebecca Blake, from Surrey, was jailed for a crime she did not commit and ended up serving 95 days in a 'filthy' cell. Speaking to the Sunday Express, the 30-year-old said she was forced to lie about being married or she would face a more severe punishment for adultery and could have been stoned to death. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Blake outside the Dubai Court . Embarrassing: Rebecca Blake has said how difficult it was to tell her parents of the charges . The recruitment consultant was accused of having sex in the back of a taxi with her friend Conor McRedmond 28, from Tullamore, Co. Offaly and they spent a year fighting the allegations. Ms . Blake said her lawyer told her to keep the fact she was already . technically married, from six years ago, a secret as if the authorities . knew she was married she could be charged with the more serious crime of . adultery. Now back in . Britain, Ms Blake said: 'It feels like a surreal nightmare. I still . wake up in the night panicking, thinking I'm back in that cell.' Blake and McRedmond  were arrested on May 4 last year after meeting at a brunch then going on a drinking binge - getting a taxi together at 10pm. Taxi driver Qaiser Khan, . 30, claimed within minutes of getting in, Blake had taken her top off . and was writhing on top of McRedmond while ‘making the sounds of a woman . having sex’. He told prosecutors earlier this year: . ‘They kept having sex for four minutes. The man’s shirt was open, his . trousers were down to his knees and the woman was not wearing any . underwear.’ The taxi driver alleged Blake offered . him ‘a lot of money’ to tell prosecutors they had been kissing rather . than having sex, but he refused. They said the allegations had been made up after they rowed with the taxi . driver about taking a longer route home. Their lawyer Shaker . al Shammary yesterday said the statements of the two witnesses were . inconsistent, adding: ‘They threatened to complain about the taxi driver . and he beat them to it – yet there is no mention of their dispute in . the Supreme Court judgment. ‘The medical records show what the witnesses said was not true but this was not taken into account in the ruling.’ Rebecca Blake (left) and Conor McRedmond (centre) walk with their lawyer Shaker al-Shammary outside the Dubai Court .

The coroner’s office told Patch that the deceased were four females and two males – four died at the scene, two at local hospitals. Their identities have not yet been released, but will be once next-of-kin are notified. Culbreath has been arrested and charged with counts of vehicular manslaughter and felony DUI, Urrea told MailOnline. A Ford Expedition (pictured) heading south in the northbound lanes of Interstate 275 in Tampa collided head-on with a Hyundai Sonata about 2am . Scene: The driver of the Ford SUV, a male in his 20s, has not yet been identified due to the fire damage to the vehicle . She is in custody but remains at the hospital while recovering from injuries sustained in the crash. The highway’s westbound lanes remain shut and the investigation is ongoing. NBC 2 reported the death of young Ilias, a Cypress Lake High School graduate, has devastated the Cypress Lake community. His former wrestling coach Paul Rothenberg said Ilias was one of the most determined kids on the team. 'Jim was an amazing guy. In everything, school, wrestling, he worked hard, had fun, was a pleasure to be around always entertaining Always wanted to joke,' he said. The newspaper reported Ilias was only the second wrestler in school history to place in the state tournament twice - coming 6th in 2011 and 4th in 2012. Yesudhas was an engineering intern at QTM Incorporated and was completing a Bachelor of Science and Mechanical Engineering at USF. Shut down: The entire westbound side of the highway is shutdown while investigators comb the scene for evidence . He had completed a Bachelor of Arts last year and was formerly the president of the university's chess club. He also loved playing a variety of sports, including basketball, tennis and volleyball. Witness Crystal Fountain said she dodged the Ford SUV just moments before the crash. 'It was a car going directly at me in the same lane,' Fountain told Bay News 9. 'It was going straight, it was going fast, all I could think of was the car was on a death mission.' Fountain said as soon as she swerved out of the way and the Ford SUV sped by, she looked in the side mirror and knew something terrible was about to happen. 'It’s just so painful and hurt that innocent people lost their lives and we still don’t know why or what the reason is,' she said. Another witness captured the burning vehicle on camera, and she can be heard screaming as she drives past the crash site.

"Merseyside tops list with 46 per cent taking three hours to get ready . Women from Susan Boyle's hometown of West Lothian amongst those who spend just fifteen minutes getting ready . By . Bianca London . From fake tanning to applying false eyelashes, getting ready for a night on the town can be time consuming. And the glamorous ladies of Liverpool know how to do it best according to the latest research which revealed they spend the longest amount of time in the entire country getting ready for a big night out. The well-groomed women of Merseyside topped the survey with 46 per cent spending more than three hours on average getting dolled up before going out. Abbey Clancy, a notorious Liverpool glamour lady, is an example of the three hours of effort the northern girls put in before a night out compared with the ladies of Susan Boyle's hometown of West Lothian . And it isn't just the ladies of the north topping the chart. Women from Nottinghamshire (31 per cent), Bedfordshire (25 per cent), Oxfordshire (20 per cent); and - perhaps surprisingly - Essex, which scraped into fifth place, admit to spending more than three hours getting ready for a night out. The study, carried out by beauty site Escentual.com, revealed the five areas spending the least amount of time grooming as Humberside, and Susan Boyle’s home town West Lothian in Scotland, where a staggering 75 per cent of female respondents said they spent 15 minutes or less before going out. Also taking the bottom spots were Clywd, Wales, where 95 per cent of respondents said they spent less than 45 minutes, Derbyshire, (50 per cent less than 45 mins), and West Midlands (37 per cent less than 45 minutes). Surprisingly, Essex took a mere fifth place in the ranks, despite being home to the glamorous TOWIE stars who are famous for their beauty regimes . Liverpool, home of reality TV show Desperate Scousewives, is rightly famous for its glamour. Scouse girls including Colleen Rooney and Alex Curran are often spotted wearing rollers at the Albert Dock during the day before a big night out. Nottingham, in second place, is well known for its nightlife, but Bedfordshire – birthplace of Carol Vorderman - came an unlikely third. Women from Berkshire, home of the Duchess of Cambridge, spend just 45 minutes perfecting their natural look . Most surprising, perhaps, was that Essex, home of glamorous The Only Way is Essex girls Samantha Faiers and Jessica Wright, could only scrape into fifth place despite having a glamorous reputation as spiritual home of the vajazzle, big hair and fake tanning. Emma Leslie, Escentual.com’s Beauty editor, said: 'We always see strong sales from the Liverpool area, with the most popular products being false eyelashes and bronzing powders for the high glamour look, so it’s not totally surprising that Merseyside topped the poll. 'Essex was surprisingly only fifth for women spending more than three hours getting ready. Again, it’s got a very glamorous image to maintain thanks to shows like TOWIE and great nightlife and closeness to London. 'But, surprisingly, it was pipped to the top by Nottinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Oxfordshire. It could be because Essex girls have their beauty and going out regimes so well planned.' Emma added: 'There’s no magic number that is going to mean you’re ready to go out. We always say at Escentual.com it’s about whatever works for our customers. For some women glamming themselves up is an important part of the whole night out experience, often with friends. While others just prefer to feel more comfortable and chose a more natural look.'","Merseyside tops list with 46 per cent taking three hours to get ready .

"By . Tara Brady . A Turkish journalist has been sentenced to 10 months in prison after insulting the prime minister with a typo in a tweet which changed the word meaning 'my chief' to 'f*** off'. Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had announced plans to shut down private schools including those run by the Gulen movement - now one of the government's enemies. Onder Aytac, who has 180,000 followers on the social media site, reacted to the news by tweeting the words: 'KAPAT BE USTAAAAAAMMMMMMK' Onder Aytac (left) has been sentenced to 10 months in prison after insulting the prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan (right) with a typo in a tweet which changed the meaning of a word . The word 'ustam' means 'my chief' or 'my master' and is a common nickname for Erdogan among his supporters. However, it was the letter 'k' at the end of the word which landed Aytac in hot water. Zeynep Tufekci, social media expert and assistant professor at the University of North Carolina, told the International Business Times that the 'k' transforms the last part of the word to an offensive abbreviation in Turkish. The columnist claims it was just a typo and that he never meant to add the 'k' to the end of the tweet. Instead he says he meant to say: 'Close them down my chief'. But Turkey’s defamation laws make it a crime to insult public officials during the course of their job. The word 'ustam' means 'my chief' or 'my master' and is a common nickname for Erdogan among his . supporters - however a rogue 'k' changed the meaning of the word . Aytac, an former police official, is a well-known writer for the opposition newspaper Taraf, which is part of Erdogan's former-ally Gulen movement. There has been a deepening feud between Erdogan and Fethullah Gulen - the influential cleric who is living in exile in Pennsylvania, U.S. The Gulen movement runs a global empire of private schools. However, there has been ill-feeling between the two since the Turkish government moved to close down a network of private schools run by Mr Gulen. Until then, the movement played a part in driving the electoral success of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK Party, which has been in power for three terms. The movement's influence extends beyond Turkey, funding hundreds of Islamic schools, think tanks and media outlets, from Kenya to Kazakhstan. It has attracted millions of followers and billions of dollars. Followers are said to donate between 5 per cent and 20 per cent of their income to groups affiliated with the movement.","Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan plans to shut down private schools .

"By . Jennifer Newton . This million dollar bike made out of solid gold is certainly set to 'brake' someone's bank account. The cycle, which also boasts an alligator-hide seat and a stingray-skin water bottle has gone on the market for a hefty $1million (£600,000). The one of a kind mountain bike made from 24-carat gold has been created by The House of Solid Gold, a U.S. company based in California. This mountain bike has been made using 24-carat solid gold, one of the first in the world . The seat cover, left, is made from alligator hide, while the bike's water bottle, right, is decorated with solid gold and stingray skin . The flash two-wheeler is covered almost entirely in gold, and comes complete with a customized seat cover crafted from brown alligator hide, as well as a unique water bottle coated in solid gold and decorated with stingray skin. It took a painstaking 750 hours to handcraft the elaborate bike, which also features the artist's signature. But buyers are being warned if they want to get their hands on the unique bike, they will have to be quick as there are only plans to create another 12 of the bicycles. The $1million bike's seat is made from brown alligator hide, and was created by Californian company House of Solid Gold . With solid gold pedals, gears and chain, it is no surprise that the bike has been valued at $1million . Hugh Power, CEO of House of Solid Gold, said: 'The idea came about while I was extreme mountain biking on a similar bike. 'It was during this ride that the idea was born to build a gold bike, customised with all the latest hi-tech gear. 'But the true challenge I faced was to make sure that the bike would be ridable. 'This is the only gold bike in existence. And there will only be 13 made in total with each one being custom built and totally unique in its own right.' The bike has been created by the House of Solid Gold, whose logo is on the bike, left. The brakes, right, have also been created using the precious metal . But despite the high price-tag, potential buyers might be happy to know proceeds from the bike will go to a good cause. The 57-year-old entrepreneur added: ""The price tag on the bike is only so high because most - if not all - of the proceeds will be donated to charity. 'The Way to Happiness Foundation is a global non-profit, non-religious charitable organisation that do a lot of impressive work to combat crime and violence worldwide. 'And buying the bike is more a way for the affluent who want to donate their money to a great worldly cause, and receive the bike as a token.' The bike took a painstaking 750 hours to handcraft and a total of only 13 will be made .","The $1million bike is made from 24-carat solid gold and is a one-of-a-kind .

'We . know from our fancy telescopes that just in the last two years more than . 20 planets have been identified outside our solar system that seem to . be far enough away from their suns - and dense enough - that they might . be able to support some form of life.' He added: 'So it makes it increasing less likely that we're alone.' But when Kimmel pushed on whether there actually are aliens, Clinton responded: 'I'm trying to tell you I don't know.' 'But if we were . visited some day, I wouldn't be surprised,' he added. 'I just hope that it's not . like Independence Day, the movie - that it's, you know, a conflict.' Clinton assured Kimmel that soon after he became president, he instructed his aides to research Area 51, the Nevada military facility, to make sure there were no aliens there. The future? He said he hoped there wouldn't be a conflict, like in the movie Independence Day (pictured), if aliens did come to the Earth - but he also added that the situation could bring people together . He also had the Roswell papers - which detailed a reputed UFO sighting in 1947 - reviewed. He said that while he had no evidence of aliens, he said that their existence could have surprising benefits for the world. 'It may be the only way to unite this increasingly divided world of ours… think about all the differences among people of Earth would seem small if we feel threatened by a space invader,' Clinton said.

"By . Olivia Williams . A mother of four who tried to use her £60 a week child benefit to maintain 11 horses admitted animal cruelty and neglect offences when the RSPCA took her to court today. Sabrina Willey, 35, could not maintain her £700 a week horses, as she tried to afford their upkeep using her benefits, and her husband Phillip Gee's Job Seekers' Allowance. When the RSPCA contacted Mrs Willey about the under-feeding of her horses, she told a welfare officer: 'You Can Burn in Hell'. Animal cruelty: Sabrina Willey from Blackpool admitted mistreating her horses after she tried to maintain them from her and her husband's benefits . By the time the RSCPA could rescue the horses one of them, a grey mare called Sarn, had to be put down. Sarn was seen suffering at Mrs Willey's stables, Oaklands in Blackpool, so a Facebook campaign 'Save Our Sarn' was launched last year. When a protest was organised outside Mrs Willey's paddock last year, 200 horse owners turned up. The RSPCA  issued warning notices to her, but they . were ignored. The animal charity then found that Mrs Willey moved the horses to another area of Blackpool that had no grazing. Painfully thin: One of Mrs Willey's malnourished horses . When they were rescued: The horses kept in Mrs Willey's paddock were immediately rehomed, apart from one that had to be put down . When they found Sarn, she was in a field containing poisonous ragwort, metal and broken glass. The mare . had to be put down the following day. District Judge Jim Clarke sitting at Blackpool Magistrates Court told her: 'When you look at your home and financial circumstances you could not avoid them avoiding suffering and cruelty.' 'You could not afford any treatment or proper livery and feed for them'. Mrs Willey shared a council house with Mr Gee, 44, who was unemployed and receiving £140 a fortnight in benefits. The RSPCA asked for £12,100 costs for their investigation and prosecution costs. Gee is to do 150 hours unpaid . community work, with a one year probation order. He was told by the . judge to try to find himself a job. Rescued: A pony from Mrs Willey's paddock, showing the signs of under-feeding . Poor condition: Bones on this horse's back and ribs were clearly showing through . Horrendous conditions: Mrs Willey kept her horses in fields with no grazing, littered with broken glass and rubbish . Mrs Willey, who was said to be the driving force behind keeping the horses, got an 18 month probation order. Both were banned from keeping horses or ponies for ten years. Gill was happy to sign over his . remaining three horses to the charity, but Willey held onto hers until a . court order forced her to do so. Mr Gill's lawyer said that he had 'no problem about being banned from ownership. He does not want anything to do with horses.' A . horse owner with stables near to those once run by Willey said: 'It . costs about £60 a week to keep each horse in stables. It is easy to work . out what eleven could cost.' 'You can't maintain that when you are on benefits...that money should be for the kids.'","Mother of four Sabrina Willey used her child benefits to maintain 11 horses .

"By . Jill Reilly . Daniel Craig and Benicio Del Torro star alongside President Obama in a new White House campaign to raise awareness about sexual assault. The Obama administration posted the Public Service Announcement, which is part of its '1 is 2 Many' campaign, on YouTube this week. The one-minute video also features actors Steve Carell, Seth Meyers and Dule Hill, alongside Vice President Joe Biden. The initiative is designed to encourage men to speak up and step in if they see someone in danger of being sexually assaulted. Scroll down for video . President Obama in the new White House campaign to raise awareness about sexual assault. 'It's up to all of us to put an end to sexual assault and that starts with you, says Obama in the video montage . During the video Benicio Del Toro tells viewers: 'If she doesn't consent, or if she can't consent, it's rape, it's assault' James Bond star Daniel Craig says: 'If saw it happening, I'd never blame her, I'd help her' The clip's release coincides with . Vice President Biden's big speech on the subject, and with the formal . unveiling of the first report from the White House Task Force to Protect . Students From Sexual Assault. 'It’s up to all of us to put an end to sexual assault and that starts with you, says President Obama in the video montage . During the video Del Toro tells viewers: 'If she doesn't consent, or if she can't consent, it's rape, it's assault.' And Craig adds: 'If saw it happening, I'd never blame her, I'd help her.' The White House is pressuring colleges and universities to improve their handling of cases of rape and sexual assault. Steve Carell says in the video montage which has been posted on YouTube: 'It's a crime. It's wrong' Seth Myers was also perosnally called by Vice President Joe Biden to star in the campaign . While 1 in 5 female . students is assaulted, the White House said the review was also about . protecting male victims and engaging men in discussions about preventing . such assaults. Research has shown that most campus sexual assault . victims know their attackers, alcohol or drugs are often involved and . only 12 percent of college women attacked report it to police . Speaking about the release Dulé Hill said: 'One sexual assault is one too many. My desire for this PSA . is that it will heighten awareness and in turn be a catalyst for more . prevention.' Biden said that he personally  asked the actors to participate in the video. 'I’m not used to making calls to big old movie stars,' he said. 'But I called them. And every one of them said immediately, ‘What can I do?’' 'The message is clear and simple; everyone has a responsibility,' said Daniel Craig in a statement released by The White House. Actor Dule Hill says: 'It's happening in college campuses, at bars, at parties, even high schools' Biden said that in the neighborhood where he came from, 'if a man raised his hand to a woman you had the job to kick the crap out of him' 'There are no exceptions. There are no excuses.  Please watch it and pass it on.' . Del Toro added: 'The PSA also encourages any witness to such acts to speak up, do the right thing, and be a hero. It is about protecting and respecting our loved ones--our mothers, sisters, daughters, wives, and girlfriends.' A White House task force on sexual assault recommended actions Tuesday that colleges and universities should take to protect victims and inform the public about the magnitude of the problem, such as identifying confidential victim's advocates and conducting surveys to better gauge the frequency of sexual assault on their campuses. The recommendations stem from a 90-day review by the task force that President Barack Obama created after his administration heard complaints about the poor treatment of campus rape victims and the hidden nature of such crimes. The task force also promised greater transparency. A new website, notalone.gov, will post enforcement actions and offers information to victims about how to seek local help and information about filing a complaint. 'Colleges and universities can no longer turn a blind eye or pretend that rape and sexual assault doesn't occur on their campus,' Vice President Joe Biden said in announcing the results of the task force's work. The PSA will air in movie theaters and lobbies and on military installations and ships from next month.","One-minute video also features Steve Carell, Seth Meyers and Dule Hill .

"By . James Gordon . It's one of the most colorful weekends on the calendar with Gay Pride events taking place around the world, but less than 45 years ago there were few celebrations of the LGBT community at all. There were no openly gay politicians. No TV show had any identifiably gay characters. It was legal to fire gay men or women, and deny them housing. When Hollywood made a film with a major homosexual character, the character was either killed or killed himself. There were no openly gay policemen, public school teachers, doctors, or lawyers. In 1970, to mark the first anniversary of the Stonewall uprisings, the very first Gay Pride marches took place in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago. And progress is still being made. This week the U.S. Supreme Court dumped the federal Defense of Marriage Act and declined to reinstate a ban on same-sex marriage in California. Adopting the rainbow 'peace' flag as it's symbol, the early gay pride parades of 44 years ago depict a community coming out of the shadows and a little more reserved than today's colorful marches.

"By . Joshua Gardner . A Florida woman has revealed that she spent nearly a year eating free rotisserie chickens from area Publix grocery stores by taking advantage of a store policy promising all sales be priced as advertised or taken off the bill. Janet Feldman, a 57-year-old who designs stripper costumes, first demanded the so-called 'Publix promise' after realizing many of the stores birds didn't meet the listed 2-pound minimum weight. A year and 300 free chickens later, the Davie woman portrays herself as a sort of Robin Hood of poultry. Scroll down for video . Chicken lady: Janet Feldman of Davie, Florida discovered the Publix was selling underweight chickens about a year ago and his been taking advantage of their 'Publix Promise' to refund all money paid for for items for which the scanned price doesn't match the posted price--in this case, 'two-pound' birds for $7.59 weren't meeting the minimum weight . Major haul: Feldman's biggest haul came during a recent trip to 11 Broward County Publix stores in which she managed to get 47 free chickens . 'When I see a wrong,' she told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. 'I right the wrong.' But Feldman never had to steal from anyone and gave most of meat, not to the poor, but to homeless dogs and cats she works with at local rescue organizations. Feldman's oddball hobby began one day as she shopped at a Publix and noticed some scrawny chickens. She actually weighed one over in the produce department and found it was under the two-pound minimum. She checked out, but thought better of it. She took the issue to the manager and was promptly refunded her $7.59. When Feldman tried her trick again, it worked just the same. It also worked every time thereafter. All 300 times. And it only got easier. 'I could do it blindfolded,' she told the Tampa Bay Times. Poultry apology: Publix responded after news of Feldman's chicken spree broke and released a statement blaming their supplier and promising to weigh birds in the future . Eventually, Feldman says the thrill of the hunt turned to concern as she realized some of the people buying the underweight chickens sold as two-pounders could be poor and that they were therefor taken advantage of. To right the wrong, Feldman made up her mind to take her biggest haul ever. She went out into the shopping plaza-filled stretches of Broward County and hit up 11 Publix stores for a grand total of  47 chickens. She then took her story, and the mouth-watering evidence, to the Sun-Sentinel. 'Publix delis have been informed to weigh rotisserie chickens that seem underweight and price them appropriately, or use those chickens in other deli recipes,' Publix spokeswoman Nicole Krauss told the Sun-Sentinel in response. According to Krauss, Publix chicken suppliers were sending them underweight birds because of a terribly cold winter and the resulting puny poultry. Thanks to Feldman, Publix has now promised to rectify the issue. 'You can’t ever stay silent,' she said. 'Everybody’s got to speak up, even if it’s about chickens.'","Janet Feldman, 57, of Davie, Florida says she was given chickens free when they failed to live up to their advertised weight .

"By . Dan Bloom . A 14-year string of mugshots reveals the harrowing decline of a meth-addicted mother accused of stomping her nine-year-old son to death. Synthia Varela-Casaus' problems began when she was 15 and soon spiralled into a full-blown drug addiction which her family said consumed her life. Aged just 38, she is charged with killing her son Omaree in her Alburquerque home in December, six months after he made a desperate 911 call to police who did little to help. Scroll down for video . Then and now: Synthia Varela-Casaus in September 2000 (left), and after she was arrested over her son's death. Her stepmother said meth was responsible for a downward spiral and left her scarred and pockmarked . Just a child: Omaree was only nine years old when he was found dead in his Alburquerque home in December . She originally claimed he injured himself falling off of a bouncy horse but later admitted kicking the child, according to Alburquerque Police. Local media reports claimed she told them she had 'kicked him the wrong way' while disciplining him, and he fell over and hit his head. Now this series of police mugshots show Varela-Casaus' involvement with the authorities has gone back at least 14 years. She has been arrested more than 20 times on suspicion of offenses from meth possession to prostitution - something her family said dated to her teenage years. Speaking to the Alburquerque Journal, her stepmother described Varela-Casaus' destructive lifestyle in one word: 'meth'. 'It just ruined her life,' she said. 'She hung around meth dealers and pimps. That became her whole life.' Baby-faced: Synthia Varela-Casaus in the first of many police mugshots, taken in late February 2000 .

'There were a few months when she’d get sober and we’d be in contact again, but then she’d go back to using meth and disappear,' she said. Varela-Casaus is being held on a $100,000 cash bond and is next due in court in August for a pre-trial hearing. She is charged with intentional child abuse resulting in death, five other counts of intentional child abuse and tampering with evidence. Last night her partner Steve Casaus - allegedly heard shouting 'f**k you Omaree! F**k you' in a tearful 911 call the boy made six months before his death - was also indicted over the case. Terrible toll: The arrests ranging from possession to prostitution continued to January (left) and March 2003 . Six child abuse charges have been filed against the woman, pictured in May 2003 (left) and September 2003 . Several years on: The drug's effect can begin to be seen seriously in October 2006 (left) and November 2006 . He is charged with six counts of child abuse, one of tampering with evidence and two of bribing a witness. Casaus is also charged in a drug case with two counts of trafficking, possessing marijuana and drug paraphernalia, DWI and reckless driving. Two police officers were put on leave after it emerged they visited Omaree's home six months before his death, but did not follow up the visit or file a report. Charged: Last night the boy's stepfather Steve Casaus was also indicted over the case . That was despite the boy's tearful 911 call in which a man and a woman, reportedly his mother and stepfather, can be heard firing off an expletive-laden rant at him in the background. In a recording of the call, the boy complains about a bruise and both adults mock him. ‘He's a s***, everything f*****g hurts you,’ says the man. ‘How can it hurt you one day and not the next day Omaree? It doesn't, does it?! You just want attention right!?’ the woman adds. The abusers then begin threatening violence on the boy. ‘Yeah, f*****g beat the s*** out of you Omaree,’ the man says. Now crying, Omaree shouts ‘stop, please.’ ‘Shut the f*** up before I really pop you hard man,’ the man fires back. ‘You caused this on yourself Omaree, cause you don’t want to f*****g change do you?’ the woman shouts. And . the man says: ‘You want me to be your dad? F*** you! I ain't gonna be . s*** to you. Don't you even f*****g look at me as your dad. F*** you . Omaree! F*** you. ‘I . never hated nobody like you in my life, ever... You know that Omaree. I . hate you more than I ever hated anybody in my whole life. And I've been . on this earth 41 years, and nobody made me feel the way you do Omaree.’ Horrors: By January (left) and March 2007, Varela-Casaus' face appears scarred and pockmarked . The drug appears to have left a terrible effect according to these mugshots from April (left) and May 2010 . As she is now: Synthia Varela-Casaus after she was arrested on suspicion of killing her nine-year-old son . Methamphetamine - known as meth and, in one form, crystal meth - is a general name for several stimulant drugs in the amphetamine family. Brought violently to the public consciousness by hit TV shows such as Breaking Bad, they make users alert and awake but also agitated, paranoid, confused and aggressive. The crystal form (right) is the most powerful and . addictive. Some compare it to crack cocaine as both are smoked and . give an intense, powerful ‘high’ followed by a very severe ‘comedown’. It can trigger delusional or psychotic episodes and in the long term wreaks havoc with users' skin and general health. Evidence suggests long-term methamphetamine use can cause brain damage. The risk can gradually be reduced if the user stays off the drug for a long time. Source and support: FRANK .","Synthia Varela-Casaus charged with killing Omaree in Alburquerque home .

Protetsors have clashed with riot police in the Philippines during a visit by Barack Obama over a defence deal that would give U.S. troops greater access to the country's military bases. Activists burned mock U.S. flags while chanting 'Nobama, no bases, no war' outside the presidential palace in the capital, Manila, where the President was meeting his counterpart Benigno Aquino. Around 800 people violently reacted to the 10-year pact signed between Washington and Manila that they believe is a step back to when it was an American colony before the Second World War. Scroll down for video . Stand off: Activists clashed with riot police in the Filipino capital, Manila, over a defence deal . Burn: Protestors outside the Presidential Palace, where Barack Obama met his counterpart Benigno Aquino, use the end of the newspaper to set a US flag alight . Filipinos ripped up barbed wire and used placards to defend themselves as officers fired water cannons in an effort to disperse them. The crowd believe the defence deal, which was signed days before Obama touched down in Philippines, reverses democratic gains achieved when US bases were shut down in the early 1990s. The former colony, which gained independence in 1946, had a US military presence for more than 100 years.

The angry protests came after a 10-year deal between Washington and Manila, allowing US troops greater access to Filipino bases . The Philippine Senate voted in 1991 to close down U.S. bases at Subic and Clark, northwest of Manila. However, it ratified a pact with the United States allowing temporary visits by American forces in 1999, four years after China seized a reef the Philippines contests. Following 9/11, hundreds of U.S. forces descended in the southern Philippines under that accord to hold counter terrorism exercises with Filipino troops fighting Muslim militants. Hundreds of American military personnel have been deployed in the southern Philippines since 2002 to provide counterterrorism training and serve as advisers to Filipino soldiers, who have battled Muslim militants for decades. The new agreement, called The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, will give American forces temporary access to selected military camps and allow them to preposition fighter jets and ships. The controversial agreement was also . agreed during a territorial dispute between Manila and Beijing over . islands in a large swathe of the South China Sea, heightening tensions . in the region.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The discovery of Tutankhamun’s tomb almost a century ago threw up some serious questions and mysteries surrounding the young pharoah’s burial. Among the most bizarre rituals found in the tomb was that the king’s penis was embalmed at a 90-degree angle – the only mummy to have ever been found with this feature. Egyptologists from the American University in Cairo have now claimed that this may have been carried out on purpose to make the king appear like Osiris, the god of the underworld, in an attempt to frighten religious revolutionaries. King Tutankhamun's innermost coffin. During the pharoah's mummification his penis was embalmed at a 90-degree angle, his body was covered in black liquid and his heart was removed. Researchers believe these rituals were carried out to make the king look like Osiris, the god of the underworld . Researchers from the American University in Cairo believe the appendage was embalmed at a 90-degree angle to make the young pharaoh appear as Osiris, the god of the underworld. The angling of the penis was a feature worn by 'corn-mummies' that were created in honour of Osiris. The mummy was also covered in black liquid to resemble Osiris' skin. Elsewhere, Tutankhamun's heart was missing when the tomb was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922. Religious texts claimed Osiris' heart was similarly removed by his brother Seth. On the outside of the tomb, decorations depicted Tutankhamun as Osiris. At the time of his death in 1323 BC, the father of the teenage Egyptian king was said to be leading a religious revolution in the country. It is believed Akhenaten wanted to destroy the belief in the Egyptian gods and instead worship a sun disc called the Aten. Tutanhkhamun was trying to tackle this revolution when he was believed to have broken his leg and died from an infection in the wound. DNA analysis in 2010 also found traces of malaria in his system. During mummification a decision was made to not only embalm the erect penis, but also to cover the king’s body in black liquid - similar in colour to the skin of Osiris - and remove his heart. There was also no sign of a heart scarab, an amulet placed on dead bodies to demonstrate their ‘worthiness’ to travel to the afterlife and for resurrection. Religious texts claimed Osiris’ heart was removed by his brother Seth and buried separately. These three rituals, according to Professor Salima Ikram from the university, were done in order to make people think Tutankhamun was the underworld god. Ikram’s claims are also bolstered by the . fact unique decorations on the tomb showed the king as the god Osiris . himself, while other tombs in the area showed the king being embraced by . Osiris. ‘The erect penis evokes Osiris at his . most powerfully regenerative moment, and is a feature of 'corn-mummies,' the quintessential symbols of rebirth and resurrection created in . honour to Osiris,’ explained Ikran in her scientific paper. On the outside of the tomb, decorations depicted Tutankhamun as Osiris, while wall paintings, pictured, showed the king being embraced by the underworld god. It is believed that if Tutankhamun was shown to be this powerful god it would quash a religious revolution taking place in the 1320s BC . Funerary treasure was found in his tomb, pictured, including an 24.2lb solid gold death mask. However, the traditional heart scarab, used to show a body's worthiness for the afterlife, was missing. Religious texts claimed Osiris' heart was similarly removed by his brother Seth . Porters carry a chest full of ancient fabrics and clothing from the tomb of the ancient Egyptian King Tutankhamun in 1923 . Tutankhamun, who became pharaoh at the age of 10 in 1333 B.C, ruled for just nine years until his death. He was the last of the royal line from the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom, one of the most powerful royal houses of ancient Egypt. The king was succeeded by the high priest Ay for four years, who married Tutankhamun's widow Ankhesenpamon. Ay was followed by the military leader Horemheb who ruled for 26 years until he ceded power to Ramses, founder of the 19th dynasty. Stunning funerary treasure was found in his tomb, including an 24.2lb solid gold death mask encrusted with lapis lazuli and semi-precious stones.","Tutankhamun’s tomb was first discovered in the early 20th century .

"By . Dan Bloom . City leaders are hoping to build a whole village of wooden sheds to solve a homelessness crisis which is one of the worst in the U.S. Two rival candidates for mayor in San Jose, California, have teamed up to demand dozens of 'microhouses' costing $5,000 each complete with doors, windows, insulation and electrics. The idea had full support from one shed shop owner - though he admitted his high-end builds were usually used as home offices. Two sheds are better than one: Two political rivals in San Jose, California, have joined forces to house the city's 7,000-strong homeless population in wooden 'microhouses'. The idea has been used elsewhere in the U.S. Village: Some of the types of units which could be used - even though these usually become home offices . Paul Johnston, who runs The Shed Shop in nearby Fremont, told CBS Local: 'These are made just like a little house would be made'. There would be no running water in the homes and occupiers would have to share a communal bathroom. But Mr Johnston insisted the wooden sheds would be 'very livable' with a solid two-by-four construction - and some even have French windows. The idea was put forward by rival city council members Sam Liccardo and Rose Herrera and is far from new. In Wisconsin, high school construction students are building 'micro-cottages' for as little as $3,000 each and there is already a micro-cottage community in Olympia, Washington. Home comforts: The sheds include insulation and built-in electrical wiring, but no running water or toilets . Paul Johnston, who runs The Shed Shop in nearby Fremont, insisted the buildings would be very livable . Metal shipping containers, meanwhile, have been turned into affordable housing in London, student accommodation in Berlin and even a boutique guest house in San Antonio, Texas. But the need is especially dire in San Jose, whose leaders say it has one of America's highest numbers of unsheltered homeless people. Campaigners say there are 7,000 homeless people in San Jose, a city which has been hit by soaring rents. A modest apartment is only affordable to those earning around $30 an hour or more, three times the minimum wage in California. The report by the rival politicians suggested putting up to 30 of the huts at a time on vacant land or in empty warehouses. Thinking outside the box: Metal shipping containers have surged in popularity, including this guest house which was created for an artist in San Antonio, Texas, who wanted to experiment with architects . They insisted it would be a short-term move and residents would be encouraged to move to more solid homes once their lives are back on track. 'We have . become painfully aware that San Jose has one of the largest unsheltered . homeless populations in the U.S.', the report said. 'In a city . of very scarce public resources, and a challenge as daunting as . homelessness, we must be more resourceful' 'A tiny house is a relatively inexpensive short-term housing option for the homeless. 'Placed together on underutilized land, a collection of very small, economically cheap houses can become a tiny village that can be managed and maintained, offering another humane option for housing our vulnerable homeless population while long term housing options are sought. 'In a city of very scarce public resources, and a challenge as daunting as homelessness, we must continue to press to be more resourceful, more creative, and more innovative with our public dollars.

"By . Francesca Chambers . Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum said on Monday night that he is 'not sure' if Republicans care about poor people as much as Democrats do. 'If you really cared you'd talk about the problems they have,' Santorum told a group of conservatives at the New York meeting on Monday evening. 'If you really cared [about poor people'] you'd talk about the problems they have,' Former Sen. Rick Santorum told a group of conservatives at the New York meeting on Monday evening . The New York Meeting is a monthly gathering organized by Mallory Factor, a New . York Times best-selling author and instructor at the Citadel in South . Carolina. Santorum was at the event to promote his new book, Blue Collar Conservatives, which was released that day. In the book Santorum lays out problems facing 'working Americans,' an issue he expounded on Monday night. During the Q and A portion of Santorum's remarks, the 2012 presidential candidate was asked whether or not he supports the Earned Income Tax Credit, a wage supplement for low-income Americans. The IRS says it refunded more than $63 million to 27 million people in 2013 under this provision. Republicans often prefer an expansion of the EITC to a minimum wage increase because it takes the burden off of employers to pay their workers more and places it on the government to give poor people more of their hard-earned money back. It has been expanded by every president since Ronald Reagan, and another expansion of the tax credit is included in Obama's recently released annual budget. 'The earned income tax credit is a good idea. There are things we need to do to reward work,' Santorum said. 'We need to talk about work. We need to talk about the importance of work.' He said he generally dislikes the way the government's entitlement programs work because they create a disincentive to work, though. 'Wonder why people feel trapped in welfare? It's because you lose money the more money you make,' he said. 'Let me tell you another thing that you lose. You lose the ability to marry.' Santorum then proceeded to explain how the welfare program in Wisconsin works, according to a state senator he met there when he was campaigning for president. In Wisconsin, he said, a single mother who has two children and earns $15,000 a year qualifies for $38,000 a year in welfare benefits. If she gets married, she would lose it all, Santorum said. 'We trap people in dangerous relationships,' Santorum said, referring to the U.S. government. 'It's not because single moms don't have relationships -  of course many of them do - many of them actually have cohabitating relationships, which are incredibly dangerous, not just for the mother but for the children, and government does that.' That's when he launched into his attack an attack on the Republican Party. 'We [Republicans] don't talk about this because – well, people ask me, ""Do Republicans care as much about the poor as Democrats do?"" I'm not sure we do. I'm not sure we do.' 'And the reason I'm not sure we do is because I don't hear us talking about it very often. And if you really cared you'd talk about the problems they have.' House Budget Committee Chair and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan and Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida have voiced their support of the EITC or similar programs within the last few months. Rubio even made the creation of a new, similar program – one without restrictions on childless applicants – the focal point of a major poverty speech earlier this year.","Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum was in New York on Monday to promote his new book .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Geologists believe they have found the youngest remains of the oldest and largest impact crater on the planet. The discovery was made in South Africa’s Vredefort impact crater which was formed when a 6 mile (10 km) meteorite slammed into it 2 billion years ago. Until now, scientists had thought all of the ‘impact melt’ rocks had been eroded away as 6 miles (10km) of Vredefort has already disappeared since it formed. Geologists believe they have found the youngest remains of the oldest and largest impact crater on the planet. The discovery was made in South Africa's Vredefort impact crater which was formed when a 6 miles (10 km) meteorite slammed into it 2 billion years ago . But researchers at the Western University in Ontario, Canada, claim they have found ‘definitive evidence’ that dikes in the centre of the crater were as young as the crater itself. Scientists hope the finding of Vredefort's impact melt could help researchers search for even older impact craters to reveal more secrets about the Earth's history. The impact crater was once thought to be much bigger at about 185 miles (300 km) across, according to a report by Becky Oskin writing in LiveScience. When the meteorite hit, it caused a thousand-megaton blast of energy. The heat from impact was enough to melt the Earth’s crust creating a magma lake. Map of South Africa showing the location of the Vredefort Dome in South Africa. The interrupted line circle, 300 km in diameter, marks the extent of the original crater . Two billion years ago a huge meteorite hit the Earth about 100km southwest of Johannesburg creating the Vredefort impact crater. The meteorite, larger than Table Mountain, caused a thousand-megaton blast of energy. The impact would have vaporised about 70 cubic kilometres of rock. The heat from impact was enough to melt the Earth’s crust creating a magma lake. The world has about 130 crater structures of possible impact origin. The Vredefort Dome is among the top three, and is the oldest and largest clearly visible meteorite impact site in the world. What remains of the event are impact-related rocks composed of broken fragments of minerals formed just after impact. What remains of the event are impact-related rocks composed of broken fragments of minerals formed just after impact. In the 1990s, Professor Desmond Moser of Western University accidently discovered 2-billion-year-old zircons — tiny minerals – which had no signs of violent shocks. But immediately after its discovery, geologists came out to disprove that the minerals found in the dikes were remains of Vredefort's impact melt. Professor Moser recently returned to South Africa to provide concrete evidence that the magma dikes were as young as the crater itself. The geologist and his team found that the zircons were intertwined with their surrounding materials, which means they couldn’t have formed from the heat of impact. They also found levels of the element hafnium, which suggests that the magma melted from the 3-billion-year-old rocks originally on top of the crater. Professor Moser told Live Science: ‘What Vredefort teaches us is that we haven't been looking with the right set of eyes at some of these ancient rocks.’ The world has about 130 crater structures of possible impact origin.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Reckoning: Dr Millard Lucien 'Lou' Tierce, 71, turned himself in at the Tarrant County Jail and was charged with animal cruelty . A Texas veterinarian accused of secretly keeping a family's 5-year-old Leonberger for six months for blood transfusions has been arrested on animal cruelty charges. Dr Millard Lucien 'Lou' Tierce, 71, turned himself in at the Tarrant County Jail at around 7pm Wednesday and was later released on $10,000 bail. His veterinary license also was been suspended by the state pending an investigation. According to the suspension order, officials inspecting Tierce's clinic found 'unsanitary conditions, animal organs kept in jars, bugs in exam rooms, open and unsecured medications.' They also discovered that five pets the veterinarian had accepted for euthanasia were still alive, one of them kept in a cage for two or three years. Earlier in the day, the veterinarian dismissed the allegations against him as a 'bunch of hooey.' The arrest came one day after police in Fort Worth raided Tierce's popular Camp Bowie Animal Clinic after being tipped off about possible animal abuse. Marian . Harris, of Aledo, says that last October, she gave Tierce permission to . euthanize her Leonberger named Sid after the doctor told her that the . pup was suffering from a congenital spinal disorder. But . last Monday, Mrs Harris got a call from a former employee at the animal . clinic telling her that her dog has been kept alive in a cage for the . past six months. In . a scene straight out of the 1992 family classic Beethoven, Marian . Harris and her husband, Jamie, marched down to the animal clinic and . discovered Sid imprisoned in a pen in a back room. Scroll down for video . Lucky dog: Sid the 5-year-old Leonberger was rescued by his owner from an animal clinic in Texas where he spent six months locked up in a cage and used for blood transfusions . Reunited: Marian Harris rescued Sid from the animal clinic after being tipped off that her dog was not put down six months ago . ‘The betrayal is so incredibly intense . that nothing you have prepares you for the emotions. There’s anger, . there’s joy that you have your dog back, there’s betrayal of this . intense trust. And so it’s just really hard to camp on one particular . emotion,’ Harris told CBS DFW. Good Samaritan: Former clinic worker Mary Brewer called the Harris family to tell them that their dog was alive and used for experiments . The mother of two from Aledo said her pet, which was supposedly terminally ill, was able to walk and jump into her minivan on his own when she came to rescue him. The family drove the pooch to another clinic, where a veterinarian determined that Sid did not need to be put down at all. ‘It was like getting punched in the stomach and then some,’ Marian Harris told the station NBC DFW. ‘This has rocked our world. My kids are like, “How does somebody do this?” How does this happen?""’ On Tuesday, police officers descended on Camp Bowie clinic in the 5700 block of Lovell Avenue and seized two more dogs as evidence. Late Wednesday afternoon, Dr Tierce spoke out in his own defense, calling the Harris family's claims as 'a bunch of hooey.' Speaking to the Star Telegram, the veteran medic said that it was Mrs Harris who wanted her dog euthanized, but he could not bring himself to do it. Tierce also said Mary Brewer, who contacted the Harris family about their dog, was just a disgruntled former employee who wanted to get back at him. The former Camp Bowie staffer, however, insisted that she quit her job because she could not continue working in a place where animals are mistreated. Since the story broke Wednesday, clients have been visiting Dr Tierce's clinic to find out what really happened to their pets. More victims? Yoga instructor Rebecca Pearce (left) has spoken out expressing concerns for the fate of her late dog, Maxina (right), who allegedly died while in the care of Dr Tierce . One of the people concerned for the fate of their pets was Rebecca Pierce, a yoga instructor from Fort Worth. Mrs Pierce filed a complaint yesterday stating that last May, she was told by Dr Tierce that her dog named Maxina has died. The veterinarian handed her a box allegedly containing the animal’s ashes, but he never billed her for any services, MyFox DFW reported. Pearce's compliant also says that staff at Camp Bowie clinic told her that there were no records of Maxina's cremation. For Sid and the Harris family, it all started last May when the family brought their 170-pound pet to the Fort Worth clinic to be treated for a minor anal gland issue, The Star Telegram reported. Dr Tierce told the Harrises he wanted to treat Sid with a new ‘cold laser’ and warned them that it could take the dog longer to recover, according to the family’s complaint filed April 22 with the Texas State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners. By October, Sid’s condition has deteriorated to the point where he could not lift his hind legs and had to drag his body on the ground. Pet care: Police raided Camp Bowie Animal Clinic in Fort Worth amid allegations of animal abuse . Together again: The Harris family, (L-R) Jamie, Cole, Case, Marian pose with their dog Sid at their home Saturday, April 26, following their unexpected reunion . Around that time, Dr Tierce allegedly informed the owners that their dog had a congenital spinal defect, and the best course of action would be to put him down because there was no cure for his condition. The veterinarian even kindly offered to bury the 5-year-old Leonberger on his farm. The family gave Tierce the green light to euthanize Sid, and even brought their son, Cole, to the clinic to say his final farewell to the four-legged friend. ‘So I brought him [Cole] in and had our tearful goodbyes, and we went over very specifically our plans for burial of Sid, and that was the end of it,’ Marian Harris recalled. Then on . April 21, out of the blue Mrs Harris got a call from Mary Brewer, a . former employee at Camp Bowie, who told the woman that Dr Tierce never . euthanized Sid, and instead he has kept him around as a plasma donor for . other pets. In this April 29, 2014, Marian Harris, third left, stands by as police raid the Camp Bowie Animal Clinic in Fort Worth . Sad outcome: The three dogs that were removed from the clinic Tuesday, including Tierce's black and white border collie, had to be put down . ‘I . remember coming in and them extracting blood from Sid, and basically . shaving him, extracting his blood for the other animal upstairs,’ Brewer . said to MyFox DFW, adding that the dog was kept locked up almost the whole time, denied treatment and he had been injured by another worker. According . to the Harrises’ complaint, ’The clinic was using Sid (and other dogs) for blood transfusions and other experimental treatments.’ The Harris family's lawyer, James Eggleston, wrote that Dr Tierce also harvested organs of some pets in his care and has kept one dog alive nearly five years for the purpose of using his blood and plasma. According to the lawyer, at least a dozen former clinic workers and clients have come forward with information on Dr Tierce's misconduct dating back to 1997, the Weatherford Democrat reported. The road ahead: Sid returned from his forced six-month stay at the clinic with mange and will undergo rehabilitation . Tell-tail sign: Besides Sid, police also removed another dog from the veterinary center as evidence . Ms Brewer explained that she did not go to police right away because she has a criminal record, which could have undermined her credibility. When Marian Harris stormed into the clinic and found Sid living in a cage, covered in his own urine and feces, she confronted Dr Tierce about the deceit. Liar: James Harris said Dr Lou Tierce (pictured) lied to him when he said that his dog had a congenital spinal defect . ‘He said, “I didn't put him down because my staff said they would quit if I did,”’ said Mrs Harris. The veterinarian who evaluated Sid after his dramatic rescue found that the 5-year-old dog had mange and showed ‘definite signs of having been used for blood transfusions.’ In a brief phone interview with MailOnline Wednesday afternoon, Jamie Harris said that Sid is currently resting at home and is in 'reasonable health.' According to Sid's owner, the pooch still has rehabilitation ahead of him, but an MRI has confirmed that he never had a congenital spinal defect. Mary Brewer revealed that there was also a cat that Dr Tierce was supposed to put down because he had abscess in his mouth and could not eat. ‘Dr Tierce changed his name to Graling, had us put him in the dog ward and  left him there, and this time that I came back in in 2013, he's still there,’ said the former clinic staffer.","Marian and Jamie Harris took their Leonberger to be put down at Camp Bowie Animal Clinic after being told by Dr Lou Tierce he had spinal defect .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A man who spent 18 years in prison on Death Row because a Chicago cop withheld or fabricated evidence against him had been seeking $18 million in damages - but was awarded just $80,000. A federal jury handed down their ruling on the lawsuit on Thursday morning over the gaffe, which will be paid for by Chicago taxpayers. Former El Rukn gang member Nathson Fields, who was convicted of a double murder in 1986 but freed at a retrial in 2009, said the decision was a travesty. Now 60, Fields has called on U.S. Attorney Zach Fardon to investigate, The Chicago Sun-Times reported. Former El Rukn gang leader Nathson Fields - pictured here after being freed by a retrial in 2009 - was awarded less than $5,000 a year in damages for each year he spent behind bars . Fields spent 18 years in prison, 12 of them on Death Row. It wasn't until after he was cleared that a missing file connected to his case was finally 'discovered', buried within an old filing cabinet in the basement of a South Side police station. Both police and prosecutors denied the file existed for years, but Field's lawyer claimed it was deliberately hidden because it contained evidence that may have cleared him. The attorney claimed Chicago police had a policy of hiding the 'street files' of detectives, which contained notes from defendents, for decades. Fields' street file was contained a cabinet with unsolved cases that dated back as far as 1944. Former CPD sergeant David O'Callaghan said the jury's decision showed he always conducted clean investigations. The jury did find however that O’Callaghan violated Fields’ right to due process by withholding or fabricating evidence. Trial testimony suggested that police backdated statements and may have doctored lineups in an attempt to convict Fields. Fields’ lawyers did not ask jurors for a specific amount in damaged, but hinted that $1 million for every year Fields spent behind bars seemed appropriate. Nathson Fields, now 60, was convicted of murder and spent 18 years in prison for a conviction that was overturned in 2009. He has now been awarded $80,000 in damages . Lawyers for the city argued Fields deserved nothing, maintaining that he was guilty of the double murder, despite his overturned conviction. Speaking outside court Thursday, Fields said he was happy that jurors found O’Callaghan liable, but said he was saddened by the award of damages that amount to less than $5,000 for every year he spent behind bars. He noted that there were no fellow African-Americans on his jury, and urged federal prosecutors to seize 20 filing cabinets of 'street files' from the basement where his long lost file was found. If uncovered, street files from other cases will exonerate other wrongfully convicted prisoners, he said. Ruth Sandifer, Fields' sister, said O’Callaghan should have been charged with attempted murder, because 'he framed my brother to send him to Death Row'.","Nathson Fields, a former El Rukn gang member in Chicago's South Side, was convicted of a double murder in 1986 and sentenced to death .

"By . Taylor Auerbach . The sentencing hearing of former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes started at Sydney's Downing Centre on Friday morning, with emotional victims' impact statements read out before a packed gallery. One statement, from a victim that MailOnline has not named, was read out by her father - who delivered her address without looking at the man now convicted of sexually assaulting his daughter. 'I was sexually abused by Robert Hughes in his home, while in his care, multiple times before I was eight-years-old,' the victim's submission began. Scroll down for video . Robert Hughes arrives at Downing Centre Local Court were the trial took place. Hughes has been taken into custody and awaits the verdict for two remaining charges . 'I will never know what my life would be like, how I would view the world, or who I would become as a person. 'I have never truly felt safe ever again. As a child I never wanted Santa to come into my room at night to leave me presents.' Earlier the victim statements of three other young victims were read out by a senior constable. 'Only getting the perpetrator stopped is healing,' said one. Scroll down for video . Clockwise from centre front: Robert Hughes, Simone Buchanan, Christopher Truswell, Julie McGregor, Christopher Mayer, and Sarah Monahan . 'I never thought I would see this day... For you to be held to account. I don't look in the mirror because I'm totally disgusted at what I see. I feel dirty. I wish you nothing but misery.' Those present in court, including pupils from a Year 10 commerce class from the Central Coast, watched silently as years of torture - stemming from the abuse on one of the most famous sets in Australian television history - were exposed in shocking detail. 'I have no self worth... I hide in baggy clothes... I suffered 12 years of eating disorders. If I hear even the first couple of bars of Hey Dad! I turn the TV off or walk out of the room.' The victim statement of Sarah Monahan, a child star of Hey Dad! who now lives in America, revealed the she may never be able to return to Australia as a result of the abuse she suffered at Hughes' hands decades ago. 'I have come to hate the word dad,' her statement read. Scroll down for video . Robyn Gardiner, the partner of actor Robert Hughes (right), looked in shock as she left Downing Centre District Court on Monday after he was convicted of a string of child sex charges . Robert Hughes in Hey Dad!: The court heard from a number of Hughes' former colleagues who accused the former star of repeatedly exposing himself . A clinical psychiatrist who interviewed Robert Hughes for over an hour at Silverwater prison last week told his sentencing hearing this afternoon: 'What he said really was that (his time on Hey Dad..!) it was the best years of his life, exciting and fun.'Dr Olav Nielssen, a clinician with an interest in forensic psychiatry, gave a lengthy expert testimonial in front of a packed court.'He wasn't particularly distressed or stressed,' he said of Hughes during their private interview.'He was anxious, but there are quite real reasons to be scared where he was. [Child sex offenders] have a particular hell in the prison system.'Dr Nielssen was called by the defence and said he believed there was a low chance the former star would reoffend, but admitted: 'My prediction is that Mr Hughes will deny these offences to the grave.'Under cross examination, Dr Nielssen admitted the reliability of what Mr Hughes told him last week was 'reduced' given that he left out parts of his shocking history that led to 10 guilty verdicts earlier this month.'I'm not judging the case, I'm looking for psychological issues,' he qualified.He said, of interviewing child sex offenders in his past, that 'generally there's something creepy' about them, adding: 'I didn't detect any of that in the accused.'But he added: 'That said, he is a professional actor and a professional charmer.' 'I learned that anyone in a position of power was free to do as they pleased. I have flashbacks to Robert... He made me think the world was a cold, evil place. 'I'm 37 years old and I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up.' Hughes, 65, was also present in court, found guilty on April 5 of 10 child sex offences. Hughes' lawyer Greg Walsh told the court his victim had been 'vilified' and 'denunciated' due to his high profile in the media. He said: 'I don't believe that the courts have seen such an extensive degree of publicity. He was exposed to what could be described as extraordinary circumstances. 'He will probably have one of the highest profiles in the prison system. He will be looking over his back every day of his sentence. 'I would ask your honour not to impose a crushing sentence...this man is 65 years of age in many respects his life is destroyed.' Prosecutors argued Mr Hughes required an 'exceptionally full time term of imprisonment' to denounce his 'abominal conduct'. Hughes' wife Robyn Gardiner, who had stood by the convicted predator throughout the trial, was notably absent from court this morning. Hughes is due to be sentenced on May 16. In April, he was convicted on ten of 11 child sex charges, with the jury being discharged after not being able to reach a majority verdict on the 11th charge. The trial took almost six weeks to come to a verdict, with Hughes pleading not guilty to all 11 charges against him regarding indecent and sexual assault. The court heard testimonies from former childhood friends of Hughes' daughter, Jessica Hughes, who gave evidence in support of her father at the trial. Two women said Hughes had entered their rooms naked during sleepovers with his daughter, and exposed himself or sexually assaulted them as they lay in bed. Another woman recalled a trip to Manly in which Mr Hughes exposed himself to her while forcing her to swim between his legs and trapping her there. Former colleagues who worked on set with the former Hey Dad! star also gave evidence at the trial, testifying that Hughes would repeatedly expose himself. Hughes denied all the allegations. The court proceedings took place in Sydney after Hughes was arrested and extradited from London after a two-year police investigation into the accusations. Monahan previously said she 'got away light' compared to her on-screen dad Robert Hughes' other victims - but was relieved and vindicated by his guilty verdict. The principal cast members of TV sitcom Hey Dad! appeared on A Current Affair in early April, following Hughes being convicted of child sex offences. Monahan, who was six years old when she joined the show in 1987, first went public with her story of abuse four years ago in a Woman's Day article in March 2010. She went on to repeat allegations on A Current Affair, that she was abused while on the set of Hey Dad! by Hughes. The actress said Hughes' guilty verdict of 10 offences relating to the sexual and indecent assault of young girls in the '80s and '90s 'vindicated' her .","The sentencing hearing of Robert Hughes began on Friday morning .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . From the Eiffel tower in Paris and a Van Gogh painting, to the Northern Lights and a tiger, a nine-year-old boy in Texas is compiling a bucket list of things to see before he goes blind. Ben Pierce is slowly losing his vision in both eyes because of scar tissue left over from health issues caused when he was born prematurely. As his world gets dimmer, the adventurous little boy is trying to see as much of the world as possible so he can have clear memories of what it looks like. Visual memories: Ben Pierce has written a bucket list of things he wants to see before he goes blind . Painting pictures: Ben hugs his mom, Heidi, as they look at Van Gogh's Haystacks after Dallas Museum of Art opened early just for the family . Doctors suggested to his parents Kit and Heidi that they should show him as many sights as possible so he would remember what things look like. 'Let him see the mountains and let him see the ocean. Take him to see animals so he can describe it better when he doesn't have the ability to see it,' Ms Pierce told KTLA. She and her husband sat down with Ben and helped him create a bucket list of places and things he wanted to see. Already Ben has managed to tick off a few items on his wish list, with the Dallas Museum of Art opening early recently so he could get a close up view of Van Gogh's Haystacks. The family . have been constantly amazed by the generosity of people who have heard . about Ben's list and sent in donations, or helped make items on it . possible. In . less than two days, more than $17,000 was raised on a Give Forward page to . help Ben complete his wish list, which includes trips to Shakespeare's . Globe in London, seeing waterfalls and safari animals, and visiting a . toy factor. Magical: During a trip to Harry Potter World, Ben was 'picked' by a wand at Ollivander's store . Spell bound: An anonymous donor paid for Ben and his family to visit Harry Potter World, above, after the nine-year-old revealed how much he loved the books . Out of this world: Ben takes a seat next to the flight director at NASA's Mission Control, who let him talk to astronauts in the space station . No one knows when Ben will lose his sight for good, and he is already learning to walk with a cane and perform everyday tasks such as cooking without relying on his eyes. 'I just don't want to be blind,' Ben told WFAA as he started to cry during a recent interview. But despite his fears, he is embracing what time he has left with his vision. His eye problems are a lingering after effect of being born four months early. He weighted just 1lb 6oz at birth, and his eyelids were still fused shut. While he bounced back from other health problems caused by his early arrival, his eyes have not been able to recover. However, he is working hard at building up a visual memory bank through his bucket list, and already has visited Harry Potter World and mission control at NASA. With a large family - Ben has five brothers and sisters - and a bucket list that covers several countries, the Pierces have been holding fundraisers to pay for some trips, and others have been provided by generous donors. One anonymous donor paid for the family of eight to fly from their Texas home to Florida so Ben could explore Harry Potter World. Family fun: On each trip, including one to meet NASA's astronauts, Ben is accompanied with his five brothers and sisters, and parents Kit and Heidi . Adventure: Doctors suggest to Ben's parents that they let him experience as many things as possible before losing his sight . Fighter: Ben weighed just over 1lb when he was born more than four months early. Although he is healthy, his eyes were damaged . Travel: Google Earth at NASA allowed Ben to see images of the Eiffel Tower, but he wants to see it for real too . The nine-year-old loves to read, and the books about the schoolboy wizard are among his favorites. When he woke on the first day, Ben was able to see the spires of Hogwarts Castle from his hotel room. During the trip he was picked at Ollivander's store to let a wand choose him. 'He was so excited, I cried seeing his expression,' Ms Pierce wrote on a blog about the day trip. 'You try a few wands that cause funny mishaps (boxes flying off shelves, flowers dying) and then the correct wand chooses the child – complete with spotlight and music and burst of air blowing the child’s hair up. It was so fun!' Some of his bucket list wishes were more straightforward. The technology fan wanted to visit an Apple store. Generous: When Ben asked to visit an Apple store, the staff gave him a yellow Genius T-Shirt and an iPad . Original: Some of the bucket list trips are more unusual, such as this one to see a water tower . Nature: Ben feeds a cockatiel during a visit to a wildlife park . But when his parents reached out to a store, they not only welcomed Ben in and gave him one of the yellow T-shirts their Genius teams wear, they also gave him an iPad filled with apps to help those who are visually impaired. He has also visited a water tower, watched books being made, visited farm animals and Dallas Zoo. One of the more memorable trips was to NASA, where Ben and his family got to meet astronauts, tour mission control and listen to astronauts in the space station. '[NASA] gave him an experience beyond his wildest dreams in so many ways. None of us could have imagined how incredible our visit would be,' Ms Pierce said, adding that Ben had been 'given him memories that will stay with him forever'. The family know Ben won't be able to see everything for himself, so they have also asked for well-wishers to send postcards to him from their favorite places.","Scar tissue on Ben Pierce's eyes are causing him to go blind .

"By . Nathan Klein . Major supermarket chains in outback Australia have removed a popular brand of deodorant from the shelves after three children were hospitalised from sniffing the contents in April alone. According to a sign inside a Woolworths store in Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory, Rexona aerosol cans had been removed due to a 'continuing social issue' in the area. 'Rexona, until further notice, will not be displayed,' the sign reads. Removed from the shelves: Major supermarket chains have cleared the shelves of Rexona deodorants after a 'continuing social issue' involving teenagers sniffing the contents of the cans to get high . 'You can purchase Rexona from the service counter. We apologise for any inconvenience.' Coles supermarkets have also cleared their shelves in an attempt to combat the social issue. It is understood teenagers are stealing the cans and inhaling the contents in an attempt to get high. A Woolworths spokesman confirmed the Rexona deodorants had been removed. 'Woolworths has removed from its' shelves in our Alice Springs store a particular kind of deodorant at the request of local authorities,' he told the MailOnline. 'Signs on our shelves advise customers that they can still purchase the product from our store by asking for it at the service counter.' Woolworths stores in Alice Springs have removed Rexona cans from their shelves after reports of teenagers stealing them and inhaling the contents. Three children were hospitalised as a result last month . Central Australian Youth Link-Up Service policy and project manager Tristan Ray said there had been a very worrying number of inhalant cases by minors recently. 'We saw a big spike in deodorant-can sniffing in town with almost 500 cases being reported over the past couple of weeks,' Mr Ray told the NT News. This is the second deodorant-sniffing outbreak in the past 12 months, the newspaper reported. Mr Ray said it wasn't just big supermarket chains participating in the preventative measure by his organisation and the NT Police force. 'We have been working with a number of stores across town, not just the major supermarkets, to remove the products from the shelves and place them behind the counter for a couple of weeks. They are mainly being stolen ... so this makes it harder for people to get,' he said.

"Reddit user posts customer receipt containing Mitch Hedberg 'bit' Comedian famously poked fun at the concept of providing receipts for small things . Hedberg died in 2005 of an apparent drug overdose . By . Chris Paine . The Reddit user said his boss loved his work - describing the prank as 'awesome' A man working at a doughnut shop has kept himself amused on the job by printing a hilarious tribute to late comedian on a receipt which he handed to a customer. The 'Freshest Donuts' employee, who goes by buckwheatwaffle on Reddit, posted the note which features a snippet of Hedberg's 'doughtnut bit'. The stand-up comedian, who died in 2005 of an apparent drug overdose, poked fun at the concept of providing receipts for trivial everyday transactions - like buying a doughnut, for instance. So naturally, buckwheatwaffle paid homage to Hedberg with an excellent touch of irony. 'I bought a donut (Sic) and they gave me a reciept for the donut,' the note, quoting Hedberg, reads. 'I don't need a receipt for the donut. I give you money and you give me the doughnut, end of transaction.' 'Buckwheatwaffle' says his boss found out about the cheeky prank - and loved it. 'My boss actually found it hilarious,' he wrote. 'Which is why my job is awesome.' Mitch Hedberg, famous for the 'doughnut bit', died in 2005 of an apparent drug overdose .

"By . Joel Christie . A California boy has returned home to his family after being contained in a special lead-lined hospital room while doctors turned him radioactive, as part of an extreme cancer treatment. Three-year-old Noah Shin, of San Jose, was last year diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare cancer of the developing nerve cells. While it’s rare among the general population, it’s the most common cancer in children younger than 1 year of age. Half the cases are metastatic, which means it spreads to the entire body, and that’s what happened with Noah. Brave: Three-year-old San Jose boy Noah Shin recently underwent a daring new cancer treatment that turned his person radioactive in an attempt to shrink a collection of tumors that had spread throughout his body . Diagnosis: A doctor at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco shows how Noah's cancer has spread. The black parts represent the tumors . Because of the intensity of the radioactive treatment, the three-year-old has to be confined in this special tank . Scans of his body showed the cancer was pervasive, so much so that chemotherapy was ruled out as being strong enough to treat it. Noah's parents then transferred him to UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco to try a daring therapy. The therapy is called MIGB and is administered by IV every two hours over the course of one day. The drug is inique because only cancerous nerve cells can absorb it. 'It’s a way of delivering high energy radiation to tumors not just in one place but to tumors everywhere in the entire body,' UCSF Pediatric oncologist Doctor Clay Gustafson told KPIX. 'I hope that we can get his disease under control with this therapy. That we can shrink his tumors.' However, the treatment also turns Noah radioactive. He must be kept isolated in a lead-shielded room for days to protect his family and the hospital staff. A big lead plate is placed in front of his crib to protect staff and other patients. Noah has been described as 'rambunctious' and has charmed the doctors and staff at the hospital . Noah's mother Cathy Shin watches her son's progress from a nearby monitor, unable to enter the room because of the radioactivity . This lead panel was put up next to the special crib that Noah was in to further contain the radioactive waves . If the tumors are able to be shrunk, doctors may attempt a bone marrow transplant in the hope of curing Noah. But keeping a three-year-old calm without having any physical contact has proved difficult, and the children who undergo the process need to be sedated. We need to give him enough sedation to take the edge off, but not so much that they fall into a deep sleep.” said Dr. Arup Roy-Burman, medical director for the UCSF Pediatric ICU. His mother, Cathy Shin, said the sedative has also helped her. 'It’s helping him relax and it then helps me to relax because now I know he’s not a danger to anybody,' said Cathy Shin. Cameras positioned around the room allowed the medical team and family could see how Noah was doing inside his container. Noah has only a 50 percent chance of survival, but doctors are hoping this new therapy will increase that . 'I want him to grow up to be a healthy happy normal boy and put this all behind him. That’s my hope,' his mom said. 'I hope he kicks cancer in the butt.' Children like Noah have about a 50 percent chance of survival. Noah will be radioactive for a couple of more weeks, but the radiation levels diminish every day. His parents are now able to hold him.","Noah Shin, 3, of San Jose, California, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma last year .

"By . James Gordon . A Kentucky family has accused the director of a local funeral home with holding their dead baby's remains hostage because they haven't paid their bill. Brittany Jones baby was delivered stillborn baby  and she attempted to collect the baby boy's body from the Lamb Funeral Home. Mrs Jones says the owner, Dorris Lamb, who is also the coroner in Christian County, refused to release her son's body unless her family paid for it to be transported. Upset: Brittany Jones is accusing a funeral director of taking advantage of her and her family them after the death of her baby . Owner: Dorris Lamb, the owner of Lamb Funeral Home says he has never held a family to ransom but said that they would have to wait a day to have the baby's remains . 'I never thought someone would hold our baby just for money, and we just wanted to bury him and try to move on,' Mrs Jones told WSMV. Jones and her husband couldn't afford to bury their son at the Lamb, so decided bring his remains to Todd County Funeral Home because the owner there, Shane Hessey, offered to handle the funeral services for free. Rescuers: The Todd County Funeral Home eventually came to the Jonses aid to assist and buried the baby for free . Rough: The Jonses said they were left devastated by the treatment they received and ended up calling 911 . Good man: Shane Hessey from the Todd County Funeral Home owner Shane Hessey went to the Lamb home to pick the body up but was refused because there was a balance owed on transportation costs . Dispatcher: '911, where is your emergency?' Mother: 'I need a sheriff dispatched to Lamb Funeral Home.' Dispatcher: 'What's going on at Lamb's?' Mother: 'They have my baby and won't release him. Dispatcher: 'Who has your baby and won't release it?' Mother: 'Lamb Funeral Home. He cussed out the funeral director. We talked with him to get a price earlier - what it would cost to bury our baby, a little baby, and he won't release him to Todd County where we want him buried.' Dispatcher: 'Why are they refusing to release the child?' Mother: 'He said that I owe him money, but he hasn't done any, provided any service. He hasn't planned the funeral. He wouldn't do anything until we come up with the money.' 'We went to pick the body up, and he refused to give us the body because there was a balance owed on his transportation costs,' Mr Hessey said. 'We waited until the next day before we got the remains.' The family claim time was running out to embalm their son so they could have an open casket funeral . Things got so tense, the Joneses ended up calling called 911 for police assistance in the matter. Mrs Jones called to say that the Lamb funeral home were refusing to release their baby until they came up with some cash  despite no service having been provided. Mr Lamb denied that he refused to release the body to the distraught parents. 'When babies' families or adults are distraught, sometimes they hear things or think things that aren't necessarily true. This talking about monies, there was no monies involved at all on our behalf,' he insisted. 'There was no charge here. For a ransom you have to have a demand. All we did is tell them they would need to come the next day.' Lamb says the family was upset because they wanted him to release the remains sooner than he did. The Kentucky Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors has investigated Lamb in the past, and another family has brought similar claims against the funeral home. Distraught: The Joneses wanted one last chance to see their baby and say their goodbyes. They claim time was running out to embalm their son so they could have an open casket funeral. That's why they called 911, asking the police to intervene . Denial: Mr Lamb denies the Joneses' claims, saying he agreed to release the baby's remains the day after the family requested it, and he says he didn't demand money .","Baby who was still born was taken to Lamb Funeral Home .

Two Broward Sheriff’s officers were caught on camera punching 50-year-old David Gonzalez before throwing him to the ground at a Florida gas station. An internal investigation is now being conducted into the actions of the deputies, Justin Lambert and Mike Manresa, during the arrest in Deerfield Beach on February 15. Scroll down for video . Two Broward Sheriff's Office Deputies are under fire, accused of using excessive force on suspect David Gonzalez. The 50-year-old suspect in pictured in his mugshot after his arrest in February . One of the officers was caught on surveillance camera in February punching the 50-year-old suspect who had allegedly stolen beer and candy from a gas station . The attack comes just months after Lambert's use of excessive force led to a $350,000 compensation payout by the Broward Sheriff's office. He allegedly 'pummeled' a party host while responding to a noise complaint. Questions have also been raised as to why Broward Sheriff Scott Israel was not notified of the use of force until three months later. On February 15, the officers responded to store manager Mohamad Kabir who called 911 to report that Gonzalez was drunk and had stolen candy and beer. The deputies claimed in their arrest report that Gonzalez was cursing, 'acting belligerent' and had lunged at them. However the surveillance camera outside . the gas station tells a different story. One officer is seen punching . the suspect before he is thrown to the ground, landing on his face. Gonzalez was taken to hospital and treated for facial fractures before being charged with two counts of resisting arrest . The allegedly violent arrest which took place on February 18 only came to light this month when surveillance footage from the gas station was made public . A witness also told CBS: 'He didn’t fight back he didn’t resist or . anything he was drunk almost unable to stand up on his own so they beat . him up pretty bad for no reason.' The suspect was treated in hospital for facial fractures and lacerations before being charged with two counts of resisting arrest. Gonzalez has been arrested in the past for domestic violence and drug possession. He refused to comment on the incident but said he would be releasing a statement through his lawyer soon. The two officers have been placed on desk duty until the investigation is completed.","Two Broward Sheriff’s Office deputies .

"By . Sue Reid . Miss G, whose identity cannot be revealed after a ruling by the Court of Protection . A frail 94-year-old spinster fighting council social workers for the right to live in her own home without their interference has been banned from talking publicly about her plight. In what is thought to be an unprecedented move by the secretive Court of Protection, the former NHS midwife – who can be identified only as Miss G – has been told she does not have the mental capacity to communicate with journalists and that it is in her ‘best interests’ not to do so. The gagging ruling – which could last for the rest of her life – was made yesterday by a High Court judge who sent a message via a clerk to the Daily Mail, which has highlighted Miss G’s case, warning: ‘This means the press cannot speak to Miss G any more.’ The draconian attack on freedom of speech flies in the face of recent demands by the top family court judge, Sir James Munby, for more openness in the shadowy court, allowing those appearing there to speak publicly about their experiences. The Mail has campaigned against secrecy in the Court of Protection, which takes sweeping decisions on behalf of the old, infirm, and disabled over where they live, with whom, and even whether their life-support machine should be switched off in the event of severe illness or if they should be allowed or forced to take contraception. Miss G has fought a six-month battle with social workers in Redbridge, north east London, who say a couple who live with her at her £350,000 house are controlling her life and decision-making. The council hopes to send in its own carers, with Miss G footing the bill. They have argued that the couple, known as Mrs C and Mr F and from the same Caribbean island as Miss G, should be thrown out of the house. Miss G has already been told by the Court of Protection that she does not have the mental capacity to make decisions about her care, financial affairs, legal representation, or where she lives. The gagging order was made by the judge granting a special ‘declaration’ that she should not ‘communicate with the Press’. Miss G and the couple who care for her face a prison sentence or stiff financial penalty if she does so. Earlier this year, Miss G signed a petition in Parliament highlighting her plight and staged a public protest in her home borough. At one court hearing, she handed a letter to judges saying she wanted to use her own name when she spoke to the Press. Miss G has already been told by the Court of Protection that she does not have the mental capacity to make decisions about her care, financial affairs, legal representation . In previous interviews with the Mail, Miss G described her experience as ‘being like a fly in a web, with me being the fly and the social workers the spiders’. She said: ‘I do not want the council people in my life. In the past, when they provided carers from an agency, they did not look after me. I was left in a dirty house alone for hours at a time when they cut short their twice-a-day-visits. ‘They did not shower me often enough and there were foxes in the garden and insects in my bed.’ Miss G said it was only when she cancelled her council care plan that ‘Redbridge began to persecute me and the private carers I chose, who look after me so well’. In court yesterday, she told the judge: ‘They [the social workers] think I am a stupid old woman but I am not. They have made false accusations and think they can do what they like. I want them out of my life and to live in peace.’ Lib Dem MP John Hemming, who campaigns for Court of Protection openness, said: 'This gag appears to be totally unprecedented . The court also heard that an independent social worker’s report has recommended that Mrs C and Mr F should be allowed to stay and that Miss G is well looked after by them. Redbridge has now said it needs time to consider that report before the final long-term plans for Miss G are put in place. During previous hearings, the court was told that social workers, accompanied by police, had turned up at Miss G’s house 12 times in nine months after Mrs C and Mr F moved in. ‘The visits were frightening and it was to try and get rid of this couple who are like my family and look after me perfectly’, Miss G has said. Redbridge – which the court has allowed to be named following a request from the Mail – refuses to comment on details of the case. However, Lib Dem MP John Hemming, who campaigns for Court of Protection openness, said last night: ‘This gag appears to be totally unprecedented. ‘It is difficult to see who it is protecting if not the local council social workers from public criticism. It is certainly not Miss G who is protected. ‘The worry is other social workers may now use the same tactics to stop press scrutiny of their actions and that cannot be right.’","94-year-old spinster wants to live in her own home against the advice of social workers .

"By . Richard Spillett . A 63-year-old man has been given his wife's blessing to sleep with a cougar – the 15-stone mountain lion he cuddles up to every night and refers to as his '200lb daughter'. Mario 'Catman' Infanti adopted his unusual pet Sasha when she was just a kitten and says she now sees him as her 'mother'. His wife Lenore, 53, completely supports his close relationship with the huge animal, which lives in and around their home in Cape Coral, Florida. Scroll down for video . Mario Infanti often cuddles up to his pet cougar Sasha after raising her from a kitten . He has built a custom-made habitat for the creature, with whom he often shares his swimming pool . His wife Lenore says she gets lots of jokes about his relationship with the cougar, but supports his passion for big cats . Mr Infanti said: 'Sasha is more like family to me than a lot of my family. She's the love of my life, she's like my 200lb daughter. I would do anything for her.' The professional jazz guitarist had wanted to own a big cat since watching Tarzan as a child and moved to Florida specifically to enjoy its relaxed laws on owning dangerous creatures. He bottle-raised Sasha as a newborn and he or his wife have been by her side 24 hours a day ever since. At first she slept in the couple's bed with them but was soon too big to fit and had began to maul and chew it. The couple then built a 3,000-square-foot habitat for her to live in, with access to a swimming pool, toys and trees. Sasha is also allowed into the house and enjoys nothing more than curling up on her adopted parent Mr Infanti as he watches TV. Mr Infanti has cared for Sasha since she was a kitten (right) and gives her full access to his home in Florida . Sasha as a three-week-old cub. Mr Infanti has since spent £70,000 looking after her . The lion enjoys watching TV with Mr Infanti and pines for him when he is away, his wife says . When her husband is away, Mrs Infanti holds up the telephone so pet lion Sasha can hear his voice . The 'Catman', who also owns a Siberian lynx, knows never to turn his back on Sasha - who he estimates is four times stronger than him. He said: 'I don't think she'll rip anybody's face off. She's not that kind of an aggressive cat. 'The only time she gets a little dangerous is when she gets over-playful or over-affectionate. I have a little scar on my lower leg but it's nothing. You could hardly notice it.' Mr Infanti carries a bottle of spirit vinegar for self-defence in case Sasha ever turns on him, as cougars cannot stand the smell of the liquid. He added: 'I have never had a problem with Sasha. The only time I had trouble (with animals) was when I was training to get my license. 'I got into a little tussle with a 350lb tiger that I basically brought up. She wanted to play rough and I didn't.The main thing is to show no fear.' Animal-lover Mr Infanti, who also has a Siberian lynx, moved to Florida to enjoy their relaxed laws on the keeping of dangerous pets . He says Sasha, pictured here when she was just three days old, now treats him like a mother . Despite their closeness, Mr Infanti says he still has to make sure never to turn his back on the lion, which he says is four times stronger than him . Cougars in captivity live 25-30 years compared with seven to 10 years in the wild. So with Sasha only just turning 14, the unusual family are looking forward to spending more time together. Despite their happiness, Mr and Mrs Infanti have had to make plenty of sacrifices to have her - including not having children of their own. They have also spent more than $118,000 on her upkeep - including $33,700 on the custom-made habitat. Although she is younger than her husband, Mrs Infanti says she has often received jokes about being Mr Infanti's second cougar, a term used to describe women who go after younger men. She said: 'It is quite expensive to feed her but we look at her as one of children. The couple say they have had to make a number of sacrifices for Sasha, including not having children of their own . He thinks Sasha is better off in the safety and comfort of her enclosure at his home, rather than at risk in the wild . He has designed a 3,000-square-foot habitat for the animal outside his home . 'So what we feed them would be money we would have otherwise put aside for a college education.' Mrs Infanti has also been trained to handle Sasha and is often left to feed her meat at dusk - her preferred feeding time - while Mr Infanti is playing gigs. She added: 'When he goes she'll constantly look at the window and meow for him. I'll go out there to feed her and she'll look past me and look like, ""okay where's daddy?"" 'When he is on tour he'll call every night and I'll put the phone up to the fence and he'll talk to the cat. Mario loves Sasha with all his heart, he really does.' Lions which live in captivity have a much longer life expectancy than those living in the wild, experts say . Mrs Infanti says the most difficult time for Sasha is when her husband, who is a professional jazz guitarist, is on tour . The 63-year-old had to get a new bed when the young lion started gnawing on the fabric . Mr Infanti sometimes gets criticism for keeping a pet cougar but says Sasha would be a lot worse off fending for herself. He said: 'There are a couple of diehards who say she should be in the wild - but how much wild is there left? I mean we're taking all their wild away from them. 'She's better off living with us, being fed everyday, being cared for medically, being loved and being treated like she should be treated rather than being chased off her territory or hunted or rundown by a car. 'I think she has a great life and she's made my life a whole lot better too. 'But it's a lifetime commitment, if you're not willing to put your whole life to this thing then you shouldn't own one of these pets.'","Mario Infanti has always loved big cats and lives with huge pet lion Sasha .

"By . Ben Spencer . Britain has one of the highest death rates for infants and young children in western Europe, researchers revealed last night. Last year, 3,800 under-fives died in the UK – more than anywhere else in the region. The UK’s mortality rate of 4.9 deaths per 1,000 children aged under five is more than double the figure for Iceland, the country with the lowest rate. Britain has one of the highest death rates for infants and young children in western Europe, it has been revealed. Last year, 3,800 under-fives died in the UK - more than anywhere else in the region (file picture) The appalling record is partly due to the prevalence of drinking and smoking during pregnancy, as well as high levels of inequality, experts said. Within western Europe, Britain had the worst record for deaths of children aged one to four, and one of the worst for those in their first six days and those aged from a month to a year old. In Europe as a whole, the record is on a par with that of Serbia and Poland. The figures are partly due to the prevalence of drinking and smoking during pregnancy, experts said . Dr Christopher Murray, who led the US study at the University of Washington in Seattle, said: ‘We were surprised by these findings because the UK has made so many significant advances in public health over the years. ‘The higher-than-expected child death rates in the UK are a reminder to all of us that, even as we are seeing child mortality decline worldwide, countries need to examine what they are doing to make sure more children grow into adulthood.’ Judged alongside countries outside Europe, Britain had a higher childhood death rate than Australia, Israel, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Although the childhood death rate fell between 1990 and 2013, the speed of the decline slowed, said the researchers in The Lancet medical journal. Across Europe as a whole, death rates for under-fives were substantially worse in central and eastern regions than in the west. The rate for central Europe was 6.7 per 1,000 births and for eastern Europe it was 9.7. Dr Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, said: ‘Until our politicians begin to take the health of children – the next generation of British citizens – more seriously, newborns and older children will continue to suffer and die needlessly.’","Britain has one of the highest death rates for infants in western Europe .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Thomas Hindhaugh, who admitted theft after stealing over £10,000 from Karen Ann Bolton, whom he met online . A divorcee was left devastated when a new partner she met online stole £10,000 of her savings and broke her heart. Recently divorced single mum Karen Ann Bolton met Thomas Hindhaugh of Dunston, Gateshead on dating website Plenty of Fish. Ms Bolton, 40 believed they were in a serious relationship after smooth-talking Hindhaugh,who has 86 previous convictions, many for dishonesty, expressed his undying love for here. But one night after she went to bed, Hindhaugh helped himself to £10,800 of Ms Bolton's money that she had recently received from the sale of her marital home. The 27-year-old then used the money to book into Newcastle's Vermont Hotel before blowing the rest of the cash on drink and drugs. Today, Hindhaugh was jailed for 20 months at Newcastle Crown Court after pleading guilty to theft. Ms Bolton, had withdrawn the money to pay to renovate her new home in Blyth, Northumberland and says she has now been left in terror and suffering nightmares as a result of the betrayal. In a statement read to the court she said: 'The relationship I had with him was serious, I loved him. 'I was absolutely devastated when he stole my money after expressing his undying love for me. I thought it was a fantastic relationship but after he stole my money I was left heartbroken because I never thought he would do this to me. 'This was meant to be a new beginning after the breakdown of my marriage, it was meant to be the start of a new life. 'He destroyed all my plans for a new beginning as well as breaking my heart, he preyed on me and used me for the money.' Ms Bolton met Hindhaugh online last July and they began dating, becoming a couple. Hindhaugh met Ms Bolton on the dating website Plenty of Fish, pictured, and she believed they were in a serious relationship . By January this year she received some money from the sale of her former marital home after her divorce went through. And it was after she withdrew it to pay some builders that Hindhaugh decided to steal it and leave his lover. After booking into the Vermont Hotel he went on a drink and drugs binge before being arrested two days later. However, police didn’t find any of the cash and Hindhaugh continued his binge after being bailed.

Hindhaugh was sentenced to 20 months in prison after admitting theft at Newcastle Crown Court, pictured . She added: “I can’t describe the terror I’m feeling since that night, I’ve been really nervous, I cant sleep and I’ve had nightmares about him finding and hurting me. 'I’ve never felt this frightened before, my world has turned upside down. 'I realised he was obsessive but I thought that meant he loved me. I now realise he lied about everything.' Richard Bloomfield, defending, said: “These sorts of offences are often described with language that begins with mean and ends with despicable. 'He spent the money on drink and drugs, he has been addicted to drugs for many years.' But jailing him, Judge Penny Moreland said: “The effect on her and her family and their plans for the future has been devastating. 'You have an appalling record for offences of dishonesty and this was a great deal of money. Your callousness in going on to spend that money after your arrest aggravates your position.'","Karen Ann Bolton met Thomas Hindhaugh on dating website Plenty of Fish .

"By . Martin Robinson . A 50-year inheritance battle over a £2million house bought after the sale of a Cornish Riviera hotel ended today after a senior judge ruled it belongs to the daughter of an alleged mistress. Businessman Albert Line died in 1961 but his child Dr Kathleen Baker, 72, has claimed since then that her family's rightful inheritance is in the wrong hands. She and her sister Margaret have been at loggerheads with 71-year-old Audrey Line, the current . owner of Harrogate House, in Falmouth, insisting that she is entitled to . a share of the historic house. The property, designed by renowned architect, . Alfred Cornelius, in the 1920s, was bought after a nearby seaside hotel that once belonged to Mr Line was sold after his death. Row: A High Court judge found in favour of Audrey Line, left, after Dr Kathleen Baker, right,  lost her legal battle to win a share of a £2million Cornish seaside house bought with proceeds from her father's hotel . Beach view: Harrogate House, home of Audrey Line in Falmouth, Cornwall, which is worth £2million . Baker has argued that Mrs Line's mother could not have been her father's lover as he was impotent, and deserves a share of the house. But the 'extraordinary saga' was today . brought to a halt by Judge Kevin Prosser QC, who ruled that . she and her sister 'have no beneficial interest . whatsoever in Harrogate House'. It is likely to be the final twist in the battle that has cost Dr Baker hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal fees. Huge legal bill: Dr Kathleen Baker, 72, who has spent 50 years fighting with another pensioner and has now lost . Her father Albert ran and owned a hotel in the town with Miss Line’s mother Norah Duff, with whom he was said to be having an affair in the 1950s. Since his death in 1961, the pair’s respective daughters have been at loggerheads over who was due what share of the property. The court heard the row has led to a series of alleged incidents including Miss Line being arrested for unfounded fraud allegations, and Dr Baker ‘rampaging’ through the hotel. Dr Baker’s father and Norah had set up a company together to run the Palm Beach Hotel in Falmouth. But a year after his death, his share of the hotel was transferred to her, making her the owner. She later transferred the ownership to her daughter Audrey, who sold the Palm Beach and bought Harrogate House, a 1920s property that was designed by renowned Cornish architect Alfred Cornelius and overlooks Gyllyngvase Beach. Dr Baker denied that her father was having an affair and has said that the transfer of his share of the hotel was invalid. Miss Line, 71, said Dr Baker was ‘in denial’ and was trying to make her homeless. Her lawyer, Guy Adams, told the court the battle stemmed from Dr Baker’s ‘unsubstantiated suspicions’ about the administration of her father’s estate in the early 1960s. Dr Baker said her father, who amassed his wealth through timber and construction firms, remained faithful to her mother, Phyllis. She claimed he regarded Norah as an employee and was planning on ‘asking her to go’. Dr Baker, who is married, said he once poured slops into a shoe belonging to Norah, and asked: ‘Do you think I’d want to sleep with a woman like that?’ She also claimed that a second will that left her a quarter of his estate went missing. Rejecting those arguments, however, Judge Prosser, said that, although there was a 'slightly odd' discrepancy in the shares transfer, there was nothing 'suspicious' about it. The executors had handed the shares to Norah 'as part and parcel of an overall bargain' and after taking professional legal advice, he said. Dr Baker's father with her mother in the 1950s. Dr Baker believes her father was left impotent by tuberculosis and was incapable of having a mistress . They had not breached their duties and the transfer was 'for a proper purpose' bound up with the administration of Albert's estate. There was no evidence of any 'deliberate concealment' of evidence by Audrey and Dr Baker, who lives near Colchester, and her sister had in any event launched their court action too late, the judge ruled. Dr Baker had told the court that, during his lifetime, her father had always told her that the Palm Beach would be 'her portion' after his death. But Mr Adams had pleaded with the judge 'to put an end to this extraordinary saga'. Doing just that, Judge Prosser concluded: 'In the light of my conclusions on the merits, I will make a declaration that Dr Baker and Mrs Gardner have no beneficial interest whatsoever in Harrogate House'.","Retired academic Kathleen Baker fought for share of beachfront home .

A TV celebrity chef yesterday told of his joy at being cleared of sex discrimination after a teenage pastry chef was ruled to have 'lied and wildly embellished' her claim for compensation. Chloe Maisey, 19, of Pontyclun, South Wales, lost all 21 allegations against the all-male kitchen staff at the restaurant owned by Stephen Terry - the best man of Gordon Ramsey. And an employment tribunal ruled she had no evidence of sexual discrimination - but had left because of long hours cooking at the top restaurant. Chloe Maisey, 19, of Pontyclun, South Wales, lost all 21 allegations against the all-male kitchen staff at the restaurant owned by Stephen Terry. She claimed she was bullied by all-male kitchen team . Miss Maisey claimed she was ogled every day as she changed into her chef¿s uniform at the restaurant which has no female changing rooms . She was claiming compensation from Michelin-starred Mr Terry, 47, at The Hardwick restaurant in Abergavenny, South Wales, which has won awards for the best in Wales. But the employment tribunal dismissed every allegation of sexual discrimination made against Mr Terry’s restaurant and three chefs. The employment tribunal ruled the Hardwick did not to have a 'culture of sexist behaviour and language'. Father-of-three Mr Terry - who trained with legendary Marco Pierre White and is a regular star of TV cookery shows such as Saturday Kitchen on the BBC  - was found to be a 'kind and involved family man who was kind toward his staff.' Lauded: The Hardwick restaurant near Abergavenny is widely perceived as the best in Wales . Miss Maisey claimed she was ogled every day as she changed into her chef’s uniform at the restaurant which has no female changing rooms. She also claims she was 'groped' when a male staff member slapped her bottom, that she was locked in a freezer and had a fish thrown at her. Tribunal chairman Roger Harper said: 'We find that on numerous occasions Chloe Maisey lied or wildly embellished facts to embolden her claims. The tribunal heard Miss Maisey left the award-winning restaurant after just 11 weeks because she was struggling with the long hours . 'She left because she couldn’t handle the long hours. Many of her claims were dishonest. 'It is significant that she never complained to staff at the restaurant, her mother or father or her boyfriend. It was only at the end of her employment that she raised any grievance with her family.' The tribunal heard Miss Maisey left the award-winning restaurant after just 11 weeks because she was struggling with the long hours and had failed to follow instructions on her last day in the kitchens. After leaving the restaurant, she went on to make 21 sexual discrimination allegations against staff. But the tribunal was read her resignation letter to Mr Terry which stated: 'I have had a very enjoyable time working for you. 'Thank you for this amazing experience you have given me. But unfortunately I will be leaving due to such long hours and issues at home.' Mr Harper said she had happily showed off her tattoos and piercings to male kitchen staff at the restaurant. He said: 'She was far from the polite and demure witness which we have seen. Like all of the kitchen staff she had sworn and made oral sex gestures at work. 'There were high jinks and pranks but Miss Maisey played an active part and enjoyed life in the kitchen. Mr Terry’s business has a very good reputation. 'We find no sex discrimination at his restaurant.' The employment tribunal heard Miss Maisey turned up to work in 'skimpy tops and hot pants' and used 'sexually provocative' language at work. Mr Terry said: 'We are very pleased and accept the findings. It is very unfortunate - we didn¿t plan on being here. We want to draw a line underneath it' Sous chef Jamie O’Leary, 32, said: 'I didn’t find her clothes fit for the workplace. I thought some of the clothes she showed up in were inappropriate for work.' Miss Maisey, who is several months pregnant, has a tattoo of a laced stocking top with antique pistol tucked into it around the top of her right thigh. Mr Terry told the tribunal that some of the incidents never happened and dismissed the others as 'banter'. Mr Terry said: 'We are very pleased and accept the findings. It is very unfortunate - we didn’t plan on being here. We want to draw a line underneath it. 'It is has been very disruptive to my work life and family life. I look to move on and forward.'","Chloe Maisey lost 21 allegations against staff at Stephen Terry's restaurant .

"By . James Rush . Sir Roger Bannister has revealed he is suffering from Parkinson's disease, 60 years after becoming the first man to run a four-minute mile. The former athlete, who went on to have a distinguished career as a neurologist, said he had been diagnosed with the condition three years ago but had refrained from speaking publicly about it until now. The 85-year-old said he was now having 'troubles with walking' as he made the admission in a BBC Radio Oxford documentary to mark the anniversary of his famous run in the city, which will be broadcast today. Scroll down for video . Sir Roger Bannister, the first man to run under a four-minute mile, has revealed he is suffering from Parkinson's disease . Sir Roger went on to have a distinguished career as a neurologist following his retirement from athletics. His work as a neurologist led to a greater understanding of degenerative disease and disorders of the autonomic nervous system. Decades of neurological training, clinical work and research at the National Hospital and St Mary's Hospital in London made him an expert on Parkinson's many years before he was diagnosed. He said: 'I am having troubles with walking. Ironically it is a neurological disorder - Parkinson's. 'There's a gentle irony to it. I have seen and looked after patients with so many neurological and other disorders that I am not surprised I have acquired an illness. It's in the nature of things. 'I am being well looked after and I don't intend to let it interfere - as much as I can.' Sir Roger (pictured in February this year) said he was 'being well looked after' and 'I don't intend to let it interfere - as much as I can' Sir Roger broke the four-minute mile mark on May 6, 1954, at Oxford's Iffley Road Track with the help of Sir Christopher Chataway and Chris Brasher who acted as pacesetters . He went on to say: 'Just consider the alternatives - that is the way I look at it. 'One of my pleasures in life - apart from running - has been walking. Intellectually I am not (degenerating) and what is walking anyway!' Sir Roger broke the four-minute mile barrier on May 6, 1954, at Oxford's Iffley Road Track with the help of Sir Christopher Chataway and Chris Brasher who acted as pacesetters. Brasher died in 2003 after a short illness and Chataway died of cancer in January this year. Sir Roger's interest in neurology was one of the main reasons for his decision to curtail his athletics career after the 1964 European Championships. Sir Roger Bannister with his wife Lady Moyra Bannister, pictured on their engagement day before their wedding in 1955 . Sir Roger Bannister (left) with his wife Lady Moyra Bannister (holding baby) at the christening of their baby son Clive Christopher . In an interview with the Guardian in . 2004, Sir Roger said: 'I had always wanted to become a neurologist, . which is one of the most demanding vocations in medicine. 'Where do you stop, after all, with the brain? How does it function? What are its limits? The work seems unending.' Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurological disorder, characterised by a deficiency of  dopamine. This affects the way the brain co-ordinates the movements of the muscles in different parts of the body. The disease mainly develops in the over 50s. About 5 in 1,000 people in their 60s, and about 40 in 1,000 people in their 80s have the condition. The main symptoms are slowness of movement, stiffness of muscles and shaking. These tend to slowly worsen with time although the rate varies from patient to patient. There is currently no cure, although drugs, therapies and surgery can control the symptoms. He told the programme he believes there is much work still to do before a cure for the condition with which he has been afflicted can be found. Sir Roger added: 'I know quite a lot about [Parkinson's] and have treated a lot of people with it. 'I am aware of all the research that's been done. I think it will take some time before there is a breakthrough. But the management and drug treatments are improving all the time.' Four-time Olympic rowing champion Sir Matthew Pinsent took to Twitter to voice his support for Sir Roger today. Sir Matthew tweeted: 'Such sad news about Sir Roger Bannister - diagnosed with Parkinson's. A gentleman and a scholar.' Hundreds of other people added their voices to the wave of support. Photographer Rich Clark said: 'Sad to hear that Sir Roger Bannister has #parkinsons He cured my father when he returned from Africa with encephalitis. #hero #gentleman.' Josh Goodfellow, a bodybuilder with cerebral palsy from Boston, Lincolnshire, said: 'Sad news regarding Sir Roger Bannister. Suffering from Parkinson's disease. Will always be an icon in Athletics. He was part of a revolution.' Professional golfer Ben Storey simply added: 'Roger Bannister, what a man.' Decades of neurological training, clinical work and research at the National Hospital and St Mary's Hospital in London made Sir Roger (pictured at his home in Oxford) an expert on Parkinson's many years before he was diagnosed . Following the announcement, Steve Ford, Chief Executive at Parkinson’s UK, said: 'An inspiration to so many, Sir Roger Bannister is a much-loved sporting legend and we are saddened to hear that he is being treated for Parkinson’s. 'One person every hour in the UK will be diagnosed with Parkinson’s, yet it remains a little understood condition and we applaud Sir Roger and his decision to speak publicly about his diagnosis at this stage in his long life. 'There are 127,000 people in the UK, who like Sir Roger, are living with Parkinson’s. Parkinson’s can be challenging to live with, and symptoms – such as slowness of movement or tremor – changing on a daily, or even hourly basis. 'Many people, with the right medication, continue to live a full and active live with Parkinson’s, but for some, it can be life changing and we hope that Sir Roger gets the support he needs to continue to live with this complex condition. 'We wish Sir Roger and his family all the best.' The race to be the first man to break the four-minute mile mark captured imaginations around the world. It had become the sport's Everest, as much a test of the human spirit as the body. It was a spring evening in Oxford when Sir Roger Bannister wrote his name into sporting history. The date was May 6, 1954, and the venue the university's Iffley Road track. Supported by pacemakers Christopher Chataway and Chris Brasher and cheered on by an expectant 3,000-strong crowd, the 25-year-old medical student burst through the line in 3m 59.4s. It was a spring evening in Oxford when Sir Roger Bannister wrote his name into sporting history by breaking the four-minute mile mark . He had knocked an incredible two seconds off Sweden’s Gunder Hagg's record. A trailblazer, the rest, including the likes of Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram, would follow his lead. For Bannister it was a case of redemption after he finished fourth, out of the medals, in the 1500m final at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, the disappointment fuelling his ambitions in the mile. He went on to win Commonwealth gold medal over the mile in Vancouver in August 1954, beating John Landy, who had taken his record two months earlier, to the title, and the man himself regards that success as a greater achievement than his world record. His winning time was a personal best, 3:58.8. Sir Roger Bannister, pictured at Motspur Park in 1953, went on to win Commonwealth gold medal over the mile in Vancouver in August 1954 . He also went on to win 1500m gold that year at the European Championships in Bern before hanging up his spikes to focus on his medical career. He became a distinguished neurologist, served as chairman of the Sports Council between 1971 and 1974 and was knighted in 1975. Bannister was master of Pembroke College at the University of Oxford from 1985 and 1993. It was that run from 1954 which made him a national hero, though. The Iffley Road track is now named after Bannister and a blue plaque commemorates his performance. And it is an an achievement which has diminished not one bit over the past 60 years.","Sir Roger Bannister said he was diagnosed with condition three years ago .

"By . Associated Press . University of Connecticut alumnus Rick Mastracchio would have liked to deliver this year's graduation address to the school of engineering in person. But he'll be out of town on May 10 - orbiting the globe on the International Space Station. So UConn has arranged for the 54-year-old astronaut give the speech from space. His recorded address will be shown on the video boards at Gampel Pavilion to about 5,000 people, including more than 400 graduating seniors and their families, and several members of Mastracchio's family, including his wife, Candi. Above the world: Astronaut Rick Mastracchio will deliver his speech from the International Space Station . 'I remain a bit nervous,' said Kazem . Kazerounian, the dean of the engineering school, who helped set up the . unusual graduation speech. 'We . have never tried anything like this before, and I know that the world . will be watching us. So, while I'm excited, I still have to have my . fingers crossed.' Mastracchio, . Waterbury native who earned a bachelor's degree in electrical . engineering and computer engineering from UConn in 1982, will receive an . honorary doctorate. He is . wrapping up his fourth trip into space, an eight-month stint aboard the . space station, and has spent more than 51 hours on space walks outside . the orbiting laboratory. He recorded the speech over the weekend and beamed it back to NASA, which was converting the file Thursday to send to UConn. The astronaut graduated from UConn in 1982 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and computer engineering . This won't be Mastracchio's first contact with a Connecticut audience from space. Last month, he and colleague Steve Swanson did a live question-and-answer session from the space station with children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which has a new building since the December 2012 shooting that killed 26 people. This is at least the third astronaut to give a commencement speech from space, NASA spokesman Jay Bolden said. The first two both occurred at the University of North Dakota, including an address in August by astronaut Karen Nyberg. The other was a brief live ""drop-in"" by astronaut Mike Fincke in 2004 during a speech by NASA chief Dan Golden. Mastracchio is scheduled to fly back to Earth aboard a Russian spacecraft on May 13.","UConn alumnus and astronaut has pre-recorded the speech .
