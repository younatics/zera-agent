"They have sleepovers, sunbathe and take selfies together. But Heather Tookey's best friend, Dew, is a lot furrier than your average pal. Since meeting at the Cheetah Experience in Bloemfontein, South Africa, in 2011, Heather, 21, from Beckenham, Kent, has visited her cheetah chum four times. 'There is no feeling better than the unconditional love of an animal,' says Heather Tookey, pictured with Dew . Nineteen-month-old Dew was born into the successful cheetah breeding programme at the conservation centre, and has built up a remarkable relationship with the HR assistant. 'People are astonished that I can have such a close relationship with a wild animal,' Heather explains. 'When she lies on top of my head, purring so contently, I can feel the love in her eyes as she stares down at me, sharing her cheetah cuddles. Nineteen-month-old Dew was born into the successful breeding programme at the Cheetah Experience . Hi-jinks: Heather plays with  Dew at the Cheetah Experience in Bloemfontein, where they met in 2011 . 'There is no feeling better than the unconditional love of an animal, especially when that animal is a cheetah who you love with all of your heart.' Describing how she originally gained the big cat's trust, Heather says: 'Dew would slowly come closer and closer to me, to get used to my smell, my voice. 'I always talk to her. She is the best listener and is always keen to hear about my day and how beautiful she looks. Trust: Dew is completely comfortable with her human companion, who in turn feels just as relaxed . Walkies: Cheetah Experience was founded in 2006  with the sole aim of saving the cheetahs from extinction . 'The time when our bond was cemented was when I spent the night with her in the little house in her enclosure. 'She came and lay on me and stole my pillow to rest on and purred until we both slept arm-in-arm. 'Falling asleep to the sound of a cheetah purring with her head resting on mine, underneath a blanket of stars and a bright moon is a moment I will never forget. 'When I look into her eyes, I feel safe and at home.' Feline the love: Heather sunbathes with Dew, her sister Dawn and another cheetah friend . Cheetahs are Africa's most threatened big cats and the world's fastest land animals, reaching  up to 75 mph . Cheetah Experience was founded in 2006 by Riana Van Nieuwenhuizen with the sole aim of saving the cheetahs from extinction. Currently Africa's most threatened big cats, cheetahs are the world's fastest land animals and can reach speeds of up to 75mph. Unlike the other big cats, they are not known for attacking humans, though freak cases have been reported, such as an incident involving the comic actor, Adam Sandler, last year. When the Happy Gilmore actor was on safari, he was lucky enough to get the opportunity to get up close to a cheetah, at a private lodge. But when he lent a little too close, the animal pounced. Luckily, he was rescued by a handler. 'When I look into her eyes, I feel safe and at home,' says Heather of her friendship with the young cheetah . A roarsome friendship: Heather says volunteering at the Cheetah Experience changed her life . Meanwhile, Dew may eventually be released into a protected wild situation where there will be little human contact but she will be monitored by professionals. 'Volunteering at Cheetah Experience has changed my life completely. I have learnt so much about animals, conservation, but also about life and love,' Heather said. 'Working with wild animals, especially big cats, had always been a lifelong dream of mine. I truly lost my heart to the project, the people and of course the animals. 'The only way to describe it is a piece of heaven on Earth, that has to be seen and felt to believe it.'","Pals met at  the Cheetah Experience in Bloemfontein, South Africa, in 2011 .

"A 62-year-old U.S. Navy veteran has keeled over and died in a California court while fighting a legal battle against banking giant Wells Fargo, which foreclosed on his home by mistake. Larry Delassus, of Hermosa Beach, lost his house two years ago after a typo in his assessor's parcel number suggested he was behind in his property taxes - but the number actually corresponded to his neighbor's home. Despite records proving he was in fact ahead of schedule on his mortgage payments and had paid his property taxes in advance, Delassus still had to go to court, in Torrance Courthouse, which is where, on December 19, 2012, he suffered a massive heart attack and died. Larry Delassus, a 62-year-old disabled veteran, died in court last month while continuing a three-year battle against Wells Fargo for foreclosing on his Hermosa Beach home as (left and right - paramedics battle to save Mr. Delassus) This distressing image shows the moment before Mr. Delassus was placed on the floor - while (right) shows him being rushed to the ambulance . Shocking mistake: Larry Delassus, of Hermosa Beach, lost his condo, pictured, two years ago after a typo in his assessor's parcel number suggested he was behind in his property taxes, which wasn't the case . His attorney and friend, Anthony Trujillo, was arguing against a tentative ruling issued by a Torrance Courthouse judge that sided with Wells Fargo, according to the Easy Reader. Trujillo noticed the bank's error while going through his friend's accounts and informed the bank, which acknowledged the blunder and fixed Delassus's credit history. But they went ahead with selling his home at a cut price auction, the Easy Reader reported. Delassus, who suffered from the rare blood-clot disorder Budd-Chiari syndrome and was often hospitalized, had to move to a tiny apartment in an assisted-living home in Carson. Both the behemoth bank and Delassus were in court for a preliminary hearing. The 62-year-old was in a wheelchair in the back of the courtroom, preparing to testify. Judge Laura Ellison told Trujillo the case facts didn't justify his client's claim of fraud and negligence. After almost an hour going through bank documents to prove Wells Fargo's mistake and his friend's innocence, Delassus went into cardiac arrest. 'He was sure that when a judge heard that he was never even late on a payment, that (the judge) would do something,' Debbie Popovich, a friend who accompanied Delassus to court, told Easy Reader. In a statement, Wells Fargo called the death of their customer 'tragic' but said he had no business being in the courthouse. Larry Delassus was born and raised in St. Louis and was described by his sister as a 'sweet boy who could be shy. He loved animals.' During his service in the Navy from 1969 to 1973, Delassus handled jet fuel and later worked as a production assistant for independent films. Larry Delassus served in the U.S. Navy from 1969 and lived in Manhattan Beach for a time before he moved to Hermosa Beach . He also worked with U.S. Airways and at LAX International Airport, loading and unloading baggage and taking care of the maintenance of the aircraft. Delassus never married and had no children and bought his one bedroom condominium at 320 Hermosa Avenue in 1996. 'He was a very good guy, a simple man. He loved animals' said his neighbor, Kelly Flynn, who would look after the veterans cat on occasion. His attorney, Anthony Trujillo lived next door to Delassus and often helped him clean his home when he needed hospital treatment for complications brought on by his Budd-Chiari syndrome. 'Anthony was his guardian angel. He was really good to Larry,' said Flynn said. 'Larry would definitely get frustrated [with the bank], but Anthony was his guy because it was overwhelming for Larry to handle the pressure.' The disastrous chain of events began in March 2009, when Delassus's payment of $1,237 wasn't processed by the bank, despite him knowing that he had paid his mortgage two months early since 2007. His bank, World Savings Bank, told him he was now behind on his payments, but because he was hospitalized at the time he asked his friend, Trujillo to examine the problem. Trujillo, 32, discovered that Delassus had unwittingly refinanced his mortgage four times since September 2007 and was unaware that extra service charges applied to his standard payments. This came to a head when his March 2009 payment was less than Delassus ever assumed it would be. The bank wouldn’t accept Delassus’s March 11, 2009 payment of $1,297 because his minimum payment of $1,297 was no longer enough, as the bank believed he owed a lot more in order to satisfy the tax situation. 'They basically defaulted him on their own entirely from their own paperwork screw-up,' said Trujillo. But, even after the bank acknowledged their strong-armed errors, World Savings Bank, which was now owned by Wells Fargo refused to accept that Delassus was not still currently defaulting on his mortgage. Therefore, despite all their legal protestations, the bank went ahead with the sale of his home for $270,000. Just a few months later, the home was re-sold for $440,000 according to public documents. Court: Despite records proving the bank was at fault, Delassus still had to go to Torrance Courthouse, pictured, which is where, on December 19, 2012, he suffered a massive heart attack and died . Wells Fargo's statement insisted the sick man he had no business being in the courthouse the day he died. 'Mr Delassus' passing was a tragic event and our deepest sympathies go out to his family and friends,' the statement read. 'In a tentative ruling posted on the court’s Web site the night before the scheduled hearing, the judge indicated she was prepared to dismiss all the claims put forward by Mr Delassus' attorneys and rule in favor of our motion for summary judgment. Given that there was no testimony or evidence to be presented at the hearing, there was no reason for Mr. Delassus to attend and it is truly unfortunate that he was brought there.' Trujillo told Easy Reader that Delassus had been requested to show up by the bank so they could determine whether he needed an independent guardian appointed by the court. 'He was there to testify,' Trujillo said. Judge Ellison is scheduled to make a decision January 17 on whether or not the case will go to trial, despite the dead of the plaintiff. It's rare for a lawsuit to stop a foreclosure will be successful, as banks don't have a legal duty to modify a loan and plaintiffs often can't afford to hire an attorney. In Delassus' case, Trujillo was working for free. The coroner determined heart disease killed the Navy veteran but his friends say the system that made undoing the bank's careless but catestrophic mistake near impossible really took his life. 'He was very sensitive,' Popovich told LA Weekly. 'He was a very good person. He was kind of shy, and he had a really good sense of humor — really, he was a very simple guy who just liked to work and do his thing.'","Larry Delassus, of Hermosa Beach, California, lost his house two years ago after the bank thought he was behind on his property taxes but it was actually his neighbor .

"Chinese farmers have captured what is believed to be a metre-long rat that had been terrorising villagers and devouring fish whole, it is claimed. They tried to cut the 5kg rodent up to eat - but broke two knives hacking at its thick bones and skin.

They eventually cornered the rat, before killing it with makeshift weapons, reported shanghaiist.com. Deadly: The enormous animal, weighing ten times that of the average rat, was first spotted snatching large fish from a village pond . However, when they attempted to cook the giant rodent, they broke two knives trying to cut it up. Rat is traditionally eaten in Guangdong, southern China, where it can be served braised, stewed or cooked in soup. It can also be roasted and hung alongside duck. The rodent, which can carry deadly diseases, is believed to be three times more nutritious than chicken. In May, Shanghai was the subject of much controversy after rat meat was found to have been passed off as lamb. More than 900 people were arrested during the scandal, according to figures released by the Ministry of Public Security. Among those arrested were 63 people who had allegedly bought fox, mink, rat and other meat and processed it with additives like gelatin. They had then sold the meat to farmers' markets in Shanghai and the Jiangsu province under the label of 'lamb', it was claimed. In recent years, China has been criticised for its ongoing food safety scandals and lack of food regulation. Scandals have ranged from milk contaminated with the industrial chemical melamine to rice crops contaminated with heavy metals, such as aluminum.","The monstrous rodent, weighing ten times that of the average rat, had been terrorising villagers in Shaoyang, China .

"Wonder Woman and Supergirl now have a Pakistani counterpart - the burka avenger . Wonder Woman and Supergirl now have a Pakistani counterpart in the pantheon of female superheroes - albeit one who shows a lot less skin. Meet Burka Avenger: a mild-mannered teacher with secret martial arts skills who uses a flowing black burka to hide her identity as she fights local thugs seeking to shut down the girls' school where she works. In a case of art mirroring life, the cartoon is one that Pakistanis can only too keenly relate to - as their educational institutions are regularly targeted by terrorists. The Taliban have blown up hundreds of schools and attacked activists in Pakistan's northwest because they oppose girls' education. The militants sparked worldwide condemnation last fall when they shot Malala Yousafzai, a 15-year-old schoolgirl activist, in the head in an unsuccessful attempt to kill her. Action in the 'Burka Avenger' cartoon series, which is scheduled to start running on Geo TV in early August, isthe first South Asian ninja who wields books and pens as weapons. The Urdu language show is the brainchild of one of Pakistan's biggest pop stars, Aaron Haroon Rashid - known to many as simply Haroon - who conceived of it as a way to emphasize the importance of girls' education and teach children other lessons, such as protecting the environment and not discriminating against others. This last point is critical in a country where Islamist militants wage repeated attacks on religious minorities. 'Each one of our episodes is centered around a moral, which sends out strong social messages to kids,' Rashid said. 'But it is cloaked in pure entertainment, laughter, action and adventure.' Burka Avenger is a teacher with secret martial arts skills who uses a flowing black burka to hide her identity as she fights those seeking to shut down the girls' school where she works . Pakistani schoolgirls attend a Karate class in Islamabad, Pakistan. The country regularly has to deal with terrorists targeting its schools . The decision to clothe the superhero in a black burka - also often spelled burqa, a full-length robe commonly worn by conservative Islamic women in Pakistan and Afghanistan - could raise eyebrows because some people view the outfit as a sign of oppression. The Taliban forced women to wear burkas when they took control of Afghanistan in the 1990s. The version worn by the Burka Avenger shows only her eyes and fingers - though it has a sleeker, more ninjalike look than the bulky robes of an actual burka. Rashid, who is certainly no radical Islamist, said he used a burka to give a local feel to the show, which is billed as the first animated series ever produced in Pakistan. 'It's not a sign of oppression. She is using the burka to hide her identity like other superheroes,' said Rashid. Pakistani orphans watch an early screening of the first episode of the Burka Avenger series, at an orphanage on the outskirts of Islamabad . The plot of the cartoon is a battle Pakistanis are all too familiar with in the real world . 'Since she is a woman, we could have . dressed her up like Catwoman or Wonder Woman, but that probably wouldn't . have worked in Pakistan.' The series is set in Halwapur, a fictional town nestled in the soaring mountains and verdant valleys of northern Pakistan. The Burka Avenger's true identity is . Jiya, whose adopted father, Kabbadi Jan, taught her the karate moves . she uses to defeat her enemies. When not garbed as her alter ego, Jiya does not wear a burka, or even a less conservative headscarf over her hair . A group of orphans who were provided an early screening of the first episode at an orphanage on the outskirts of Islamabad laughed and cheered as the Burka Avenger vanquished her enemies. Ten year-old Samia Naeem said she liked the crusading heroine 'because she saved kids' lives, she motivated them for education and school.' Rashid, the pop star, funded much of the program himself, but also had help from an outside donor who preferred not to be credited. He leveraged his musical background in the process. Each of the 13 episodes completed so far contains songs written and performed by him and other major Pakistani rock stars, such as Ali Azmat and Ali Zafar. Rashid is producing an album of 10 songs and music videos that will be broadcast alongside the show. He has also created a Burka Avenger iPhone game and a fully interactive website that will accompany the show's launch.","Burka Avenger is a mild-mannered teacher with secret martial arts skills .

"A mother has been jailed for child neglect after her 4-year-old son was discovered ill in 'appalling squalor' in a house filled with 20 ferrets running loose and 14 dogs. The boy was taken to the high dependency unit at a Lancashire hospital, where he was only able to take food through a gastric tube. He’d been living in ‘absolute squalor’, a court heard, with rubbish, rancid food and animal faeces on the floor. There were also two dead birds in cages. ¿Absolute squalor¿: A court was told the house was piled high with rubbish, rancid food and animal faeces on the floor. There were also two dead birds in cages . A policeman chanced upon the boy who cannot be named for legal reasons at the house in east Lancashire, when he visited to investigate a missing dog. The boy's 21-year-old mother was sentenced yesterday to two years in prison at Preston Crown Court, Lancashire, for neglecting her son. PC Lloyd Jones who found the boy said that the conditions he encountered were ‘the worst he had ever seen’, the court heard. PC Jones found the child on a mattress. He was so ill he needed a feeding tube to his stomach and had a serious bacterial infection in an open wound on his torso. The 4-year-old boy was made so ill by his living conditions that he is unable to eat and has to be fed via a gastric tube . Judge Anthony Russell, QC, the recorder at Preston Crown Court, told the boy’s mother: ‘The neglect was over a period of two months and appears to have commenced when you moved from one home to another. ‘The child is only able to take food through a gastric tube. You lived alone with him and a very large number of animals. ‘The police called at your home about a missing dog and came across a scene of absolute squalor. ‘The house was filthy with rubbish, foodstuffs and animal faeces everywhere. ‘I have seen the photographs and it is shocking that anyone can let a house get into that state. ‘An experienced police officer described the conditions as the worst he had ever seen.’ A policeman who discovered the boy by chance when he went to investigate a report of a missing dog described the conditions as the worst he had ever seen . Judith McCullough, defending, told the court her client had been suffering from depression. She said: ‘The circumstances in which she found herself were escalating and worsening as time went on and of course, in addition also had a child who required more care than perhaps some other children may have done. ‘She accepts that she failed to care for him in the way she ought to have done. ‘She has shown genuine remorse and she picked herself up by the bootstraps and has made efforts to move forward. ‘She is well aware she might receive a custodial sentence and has written a letter to her son to be read to him if it is the case. The birds: When police investigated they found two dead birds in cages . ‘There will be no repeat of this behaviour. That does not mean she is not a young woman who clearly requires support and to examine what went wrong during the last part of last year.’ But Judge Russell told the defendant, who had pleaded guilty to a charge of child neglect at an earlier hearing: ‘Although it has been argued that there was a lack of support available to you, I do not accept that argument because you had previously had support and knew it was available. ‘I do accept that you have had a difficult history. I also accept that you now acknowledge that your care was inadequate. ‘Such mitigation cannot extinguish the fact that this was very serious neglect.’ Speaking after the hearing, a Lancashire Police spokesman said: ‘Cases like this which involve the ill-treatment of young children are always very hard to deal with, but we welcome this sentence.‘This was a particularly appalling case of child neglect involving a vulnerable 4-year-old boy who was living in truly shocking conditions. ‘The house was in a completely uninhabitable state for anyone, let alone a small child, and thankfully he is now being looked after properly.’","Boy discovered by chance when policeman was investigating missing dog .

"Grieving families who were unable to identify the remains of their loved ones who died in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, may finally be able to lay them to rest with the help of DNA. Scientists in New York are carrying out painstaking work on the last known fragments of people who died in the World Trade Center- hoping to use DNA to be identify those who remain missing. Each day a dedicated team of forensic scientists sift through thousands of vacuum-sealed plastic pouches filled with bits of bone rest in a Manhattan laboratory. Tests: Mark Desire, right, assistant director for forensic biology at the Office of Chief Medical Examiner, speaks as a trainee forensic scientist, prepares sample bone fragments for DNA testing at the training lab in New York . On Saturday, the 7,930 pouches are due to . be moved in a solemn procession from the city medical examiner's office . to the new trade center site. They will be kept in a bedrock repository 70 feet underground in the new September 11 Memorial Museum that opens May 21. The museum will . charge $24 for entrance but the remains will not be a part of the . exhibit. The move will mean that families who have effectively been living in limbo since their loved-ones were killed on that fateful day will have somewhere that they can go to be with the remains. The . remains will be accessible only to families of the dead and to the . forensic scientists who are still trying to match the bone slivers to . DNA from the more than 1,000 victims who never came home and have never . been identified. Bone grinding: Michael Mosco works  to match the bone with DNA from victims who have never been identified . New technology: Advances in technology  have yielded results impossible 10 years ago to match the bone with DNA from those who died on Sept. 11, 2001 .

DNA: Michael Mosco prepares to enter the bone grinding room at the Office of Chief Medical Examiner in New York - the room is central to the examination of bone DNA from those who died on Sept. 11 . However, while the bereaved families have long endorsed the . ongoing identification process, some have protested against this weekend's move of the remains. They fear that the museum site could be prone . to flooding after witnessing the aftermath of Super storm Sandy which swept through lower Manhattan in 2012, flooding buildings and causing widespread water damage. Rosemary Cain, a mother who lost her firefighter son at the World Trade Center pleaded at a protest on Thursday: 'Don't put them [the remains] in the basement.' 'Give them respect so 3,000 souls can rest in . peace,' she said. United front: Rosemary Cain Centre, the mother of deceased firefighter George Cain, pauses before attending a press conference opposing the placement of unknown human remains of victims in the basement of the 9/11 Museum at Ground Zero . However, Mark . Desire, who oversees the four-member World Trade Center team in the . city's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, is keen to stress that the . remains will be treated with the utmost respect. 'Our commitment to return the remains to the families is as great today as it was in 2001,' he said. Over . 2,753 people were reported missing at the World Trade Center after it was . attacked on a sunny September morning in downtown Manhattan. Of . those victims, 1,115 victims - at least 41 percent - have not been . identified through a DNA match to items provided by families — . toothbrushes, combs, clothing or swabs from relatives. Justice: Attorney Norman Siegel says families oppose the placement of unknown human remains of victims in the basement of the 9/11 Museum .

Renewed hope: Rosemary Cain, the mother of deceased firefighter George Cain holds his image as she protests over 9/11 remains . But technological advances in DNA testing has given the families renewed hope as the process of identification has become far easier than it was a decade ago. Families want to be able to formally find their lost loved . ones by using the unique genetic code gleaned from the bits of bone. It . is, in fact, the only hope for families waiting for anything tangible . to officially confirm what they already know: their loved one died. In . some cases, scientists have gone back to the same bone fragment 10 or . 15 times, using new technology to attempt to extract DNA diminished by . fire, sunlight, bacteria and even the jet fuel that poured through the . towers. Four new identifications were made this past year. By . December, the latest technology will have been applied to every remnant . in the medical examiner's possession, exhausting the available methods, . for now. Beyond this year, . families who still have not been given any hope of finding their family . members, will face uncertainty about how long and at what cost the . forensic team will keep working to identify these last 9/11 remains. Support: Rosaleen Tallon, left, sister of firefighter Sean Tallon killed in the 9-11 World Trade Center attacks, embraces Rosemary Cain, who lost her son George in the attacks . Sadness: A woman visits the National September 11 Memorial & Museum and admits that her family lost friends in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 .

City of light: One World Trade Center towers over the lower Manhattan skyline in New York . The team's annual budget is $230,000, plus costs for follow-up work by other scientists and staff. However, Charles . Strozier, founding director of the Center on Terrorism at the John Jay . College of Criminal Justice, said that work must continue 'because our . relationship to the September 11 disaster hinges on being able to . identify and pay respects to those who died.' He said: 'The World Trade Center attack was more cruel than death usually . is, because some people were simply incinerated and those remains went . into the air.' For Mr Desire and those like him who work on the remains, it's not just a grim scientific task — it's  personal. He . said that Ms Cain's missing firefirghting son was under the . still-standing towers minutes after the two hijacked planes hit them, . having rushed down with the then-chief medical examiner, Dr. Charles .

"A diamond-swallowing thief who was ordered to undergo a colonoscopy to recover two engagement rings says his experience was more inconvenient than painful. David William Watts, 50, was sentenced in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Thursday after he pleaded guilty to one count of stealing and three unrelated charges. He was ordered to cough up more than $11,000 in compensation and received a suspended six-month jail sentence. Scroll down for video . David Watts snatched and swallowed two diamond rings from a jewellery store in Brisbane's west in 2013 . Watts has been ordered to pay $11,000 compensation and received a suspended six-month jail sentence . Watts was arrested in late 2013 after snatching and swallowing two diamond rings from Crown Family Jewellers at Indooroopilly, in Brisbane's west. The court heard the forensic recovery process didn't go as planned and one of the rings was lost. Magistrate Noel Noonan said it should have been in Watts' interest to retrieve the second ring, which he passed on during his 11 days in custody. 'For some bizarre reason ... you then cleaned it, tied a bit of string to it, and then swallowed it again in the shower, where CCTV recorded suspicious behaviour,' he said. The 50-year-old, pictured at court on Thursday, was ordered to undergo a colonoscopy to retrieve the rings following the theft . Outside court, Watts accused police of stealing the first ring and said he re-ingested the second to keep it from officers. He said he was treated badly in custody and police didn't know how to approach the problem. 'They had me in a glass, y'know like Hannibal Lecter was in, a square thing with the glass. That's how they had me man.' Watts also alleged police had threatened to kill him. The fate of the lost ring is now the subject of a police probe. Despite the procedure, one of the rings was lost and is being investigated in a police probe . In sentencing, the magistrate took into account Watts' early guilty plea and noted that the pensioner has had a 'difficult life'. 'You're hardly a serious criminal,' Magistrate Noonan said, soon after Watts' mobile phone had rung in court for a second time. The court was told Watts was sexually abused while in the Boys Town school for disadvantaged children, had been anticipating a payout and was 'angry and depressed' at the time of the offence. Watts said he wasn't sure how he was going to pay the compensation. 'It's gonna come out of my pension ... so it'll be even harder to live.'","David Watts snatched and swallowed two diamond rings in 2013 .

"Heirs of the late movie legend John Wayne are suing Duke University for the right to use the actor's iconic nickname to promote their alcoholic beverages. Wayne's family wants to sell products featuring the Hollywood star's nickname and image, but the North Carolina university says it doesn't want anyone to think it sponsors the booze. John Wayne Enterprises filed a . lawsuit in Orange County federal court on Thursday, claiming its trademarks don't violate Duke University's rights or cause confusion. Movie legend: Late actor John Wayne, pictured on the set of 'The Cowboys' in New Mexico in April 1971, was known as 'The Duke' Lawsuit: John Wayne Enterprises is suing Duke University over the right to register the trademark 'Duke' to promote its alcoholic beverages, including bourbon (pictured) In their complaint, JWE say it’s 'ludicrous' to think anyone would believe Duke University had endorsed a bottle of bourbon featuring Wayne’s photo and signature with a shotgun shell casing. 'Duke is a common word that has been in use for centuries in a wide array of commercial and other applications wholly independent of Duke University,' the complaint says. 'Yet by the actions alleged herein, Duke University seems to think it owns the word ‘Duke’ for all purposes and applications.' The school has not formally responded to the complaint, however spokesman Michael Schoenfeld told OC Register: 'We admire and respect John Wayne’s contributions to American culture, but as The Duke himself once said, ‘Words are what men live by … words they say and mean'.' No court dates have been set. According to the complaint, the trademark war began in 2005 when Duke filed an objection with the US Patent and Trademark Office after the family tried to register the nickname in connection with restaurant services. Duke University has consistently argued that trademarks sought or obtained by the actor’s heirs are 'substantially similar' to the school’s trademarks, which could confuse consumers. Turf war: John Wayne Enterprises have battled North Carolina's Duke University (pictured) since 2005 over use of the 'Duke' trademark . According to federal records, the university in Durham has several trademarks for logos used to sell . products such as stickers and drinking glasses, but it doesn't sell alcoholic beverages. Last year, Duke University filed oppositions to two . new trademarks JWE sought for alcoholic beverages, one with the moniker 'Duke' and the other with Wayne’s photo and signature. According to the complaint, John Wayne was given the nickname 'Duke' as a boy by firefighters in his Iowa hometown. It was the name of his dog.","Movie legend John Wayne was known as 'The Duke'

"One of America's top health officials says there would probably already be a vaccine for Ebola if it were not for budget cuts to scientific research, but his own agency has seen a 69 per cent annual budget increase since 2000. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said a lack of money invested in research over the past decade has hampered the production of vaccinations for infectious diseases. And a new television ad claims that budget 'cuts' enacted by Republicans are responsible. But Collins himself presides over the decision-making on how much NIH funding is devoted to medical research, an insider told MailOnline. And overall funding for the agency is up to $30.15 billion this year – up from $17.84 billion in 2000. And the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, the sub-agency in charge of research to combat potential epidemics, has seen a whopping 220 per cent increase in the same period of time. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . NIH chief Dr. Francis Collins said a lack of money for research over the past decade has hampered the production of vaccines for infectious diseases – but his budgets are substantially higher now . The Agenda Project, a group that works to elect liberal politicians, is blaming Republican lawmakers for what it says is a drop in funding for disease research . BUDGET CUTS? Overall federal funding for the NIH (in red) is up 69 per cent since 2000; the NIAID, which is in charge of epidemic disease research, is up 220 per cent . Collins claimed over the weekend that budget cuts in Washington have left the international community playing catch-up on a potentially avoidable humanitarian catastrophe. 'NIH has been working on Ebola vaccines since 2001,' Dr. Collins told The Huffington Post. 'It's not like we suddenly woke up and thought, ""Oh my gosh, we should have something ready here"".' 'Frankly, if we had not gone through our 10-year slide in research support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this that would've gone through clinical trials and would have been ready.' That ten-year slide, an agency insider told MailOnline, is not Congress' fault. 'Say what you will about Congress,' the 15-year NIH veteran said on Monday, but every government agency is always looking for more money and in the case of NIH, we usually get it.' 'I've been around the block a few times, and I'm surprised at how cynical this stuff has become now that we're using Ebola as an excuse to ramp up the budget next year. It's awful.' A liberal advocacy group called The Agenda Project began running a 30-second television ad on Monday claiming that the GOP is responsible for cuts in NIH funding that led to a slow Ebola response. 'Republican Cuts Kill,' the ad blares, following a montage of Republicans saying the word 'cut.' It's unclear whether any of them were speaking about medical research funding when they made their comments. During the first two years of his presidency, President Barack Obama had the benefit of a Congress with Democrats in control of both houses. In the federal budget passed during the first of those two years, NIH funding increased 2.3 per cent. In the second, it was decreased by 1 per cent. The Ebola virus epidemic has killed more than 4,000 people, mostly in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) figures published last week. Clinical trials on potential Ebola vaccines have been rushed into operation, including one drug trial for healthcare workers in Mali. It could take months before its effectiveness is known. In the United States, it takes an average of 12 years for a pharmaceutical company to clear all the regulatory hurdles associated with securing a new drug approval. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said 90 per cent of economic costs of any outbreak 'come from irrational and disorganized efforts of the public to avoid infection' The Ebola epidemic has killed more than 4,000 people, mostly in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, according to WHO figures . Speaking from NIH's headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, Dr. Collins said some therapeutics to fight Ebola 'were on a slower track than would've been ideal, or that would have happened if we had been on a stable research support trajectory'. 'We would have been a year or two ahead of where we are, which would have made all the difference,' he said. Dr. Collins' words came as the WHO called the Ebola outbreak 'the most severe, acute health emergency seen in modern times'. The organization also said  that economic disruptions can be curbed if people are adequately informed to prevent irrational moves to dodge infection. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, citing World Bank figures, said 90 per cent of economic costs of any outbreak 'come from irrational and disorganized efforts of the public to avoid infection'. Staffers of the global health organization 'are very well aware that fear of infection has spread around the world much faster than the virus,' Chan said in a statement read out to a regional health conference in the Philippine capital, Manila. 'We are seeing, right now, how this virus can disrupt economies and societies around the world,' she said. WHO describes the current Ebola outbreak 'the most severe, acute health emergency seen in modern times' But Ms Chan added that adequately educating the public was a 'good defense strategy' and would allow governments to prevent economic disruptions. She did not specify those steps but praised the Philippines for holding an anti-Ebola summit last week which was joined by government health officials and private sector representatives, warning that the Southeast Asian country was vulnerable due to the large number of Filipinos working abroad. Last week, Thomas Eric Duncan from Dallas became the first Ebola patient to die from the virus in the US . While bracing for Ebola, health officials should continue to focus on major health threats, including non-communicable diseases, she said. Last month, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged leaders in the most affected countries to establish special centers that aim to isolate infected people from non-infected relatives in an effort to stem the spread of Ebola. Ban has also appealed for international airlines and shipping companies not to suspend services to countries affected by Ebola. Doing so, he said, hinders delivery of humanitarian and medical assistance. Healthcare systems in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, where the outbreak was first recorded in March, have been overwhelmed by the epidemic. The disease has also spread to Senegal, Nigeria, Spain and the United States. Last week, Thomas Duncan from Dallas, Texas, became the first Ebola patient to die from the virus in the United States. Dr. Collins, who spends his days almost exclusively on the disease, urged for calm when contemplating the possibility of an outbreak of the Ebola virus. He said Ebola is a highly deadly disease, but it is also only transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids or objects contaminated with the virus. 'Certainly there's been a lot of fear [in the] response from people who are probably at essentially zero risk, that this might somehow take over our country, which is really not going to happen,' he told the Huffington Post. Dr. Collins said he the development of vaccines to fight Ebola 'were on a slower track than would've been ideal' 'And despite all the assurances [...] it still hasn't quite sunk in. There's still the cable news people who are whipping this up, and frankly sometimes using it for political purposes to sort of shoot at the government.' Dr. Collins said he agreed with the comparison made by Tom Frieden, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, of the current Ebola crisis to the outbreak of AIDS. But the current crisis should be kept in perspective. 'More people will die today of AIDS than have died so far in the entire Ebola epidemic,' he said. 'We've somehow gotten used to that, and it doesn't seem to be so threatening or frightening. Certainly in the United States, another 50,000 people will get infected with HIV this year, because that's been sort of the steady number. 'How many more people will get infected with Ebola this year in the US?' he said. 'I would guess you could count among the fingers of two hands, depending on what contacts of the guy in Dallas actually turned out to get infected.'","National Institutes of Health chief Dr. Francis Collins said stagnant spending has hampered vaccine production .

"There are planes, trains and automobiles as well as homes, airports and mines. And all are eerily quiet. These are some of the world's strangest places, spots where time appears to have stood still.

"American Idol runner-up Clay Aiken has won what had been a hotly contested Democratic primary for a North Carolina congressional seat after his opponent suddenly died on Monday. The final, unofficial vote count that was posted Tuesday and it ruled that Aiken was the winner. The county-by-county tally of the 2nd Congressional District race posted by the state Tuesday confirmed Aiken got more than 40 per cent of the vote needed to win the three-candidate race. Aiken will face Republican incumbent Renee Ellmers in November in the GOP-leaning district where Mitt Romney won nearly six in 10 votes in 2012. Winner of the first round: The vote in the Democratic primary was too close to call at first but apparently Clay Aiken was the final winner and will now face the Republican incumbent Renee Ellmers . Ellmers won by 56 per cent that year and is not looking for a third term. On Monday, second-place finisher Keith Crisco, 71, died after falling at his home. Hours earlier, campaign manager Christine Botta said they had counted the absentee votes in two key counties, forcing Crisco to acknowledge defeat. He had decided to concede his loss to Aiken on Tuesday, she said. 'Keith and I talked in detail about the fact that the votes weren't there,' Botta said. Aiken and Crisco each picked up a handful of votes after the last of the absentee ballots returned by a Monday deadline were counted, according to results on the State Board of Elections website. The results will become official after . review by the state elections board. That meeting isn't yet set, . Elections board spokesman Joshua Lawson said, but is tentatively . scheduled for May 22.

In that role he was one of the state's most prolific recruiters of businesses from other states, serving in the administration of then-Governor Bev Perdue. Aiken, 35, issued a statement shortly after the news was confirmed by Crisco's textile company, Asheboro Elastics. 'I . am stunned and deeply saddened by Keith Crisco's death,' the . entertained said. 'Keith came from humble beginnings. No matter how high . he rose – to Harvard, to the White House and to the Governor's Cabinet . – he never forgot where he came from.'

'The main thing is why were they buried out up there? There is a perfectly good church in Hallaton. Was it a special place?' The chapel may have been an area of pilgrimage. Alternatively, the bodies might have been refused burial in the main church, perhaps because they were criminals, foreigners or sick. The skeletons are both believed to be of a similar age, but Ms Score said further analysis is needed to know how old they were at the time of death. The skeletons were unearthed at the Chapel of St Morrell in Hallaton. The skeletons are both believed to be of a similar age, but further analysis is needed to know how old they were at the time of death . Volunteers had been digging site, which was built on top of a Roman building, two weeks a year for four years . They were discovered among nine other bodies from the same period. The Chapel of St Morrell was thought to be a site of pilgrimage in Hallaton, Leicestershire during the 14th Century. The location of the chapel was unknown before research by local historian John Morison suggested its location at Hare Pie Bank where the annual Easter Hare Pie Scramble and Bottle Kicking take place. The excavations found the walls and tiled floor of the chapel as well as fragments of the stone masonry, tiles and lead from the windows. A number of silver pennies dating from between the 11th - 15th centuries have also been found on the site indicating when the chapel was in use. Why people were buried at the Chapel rather than in the main church in the village is unknown but it is possible that this was a special place of burial perhaps for pilgrims. Historian William Burton mentions in 1641 that ‘Halloughton…a place of special holiness (the etymon of the name importing as much as Holy-town) so as sick folks did use to flock thither to die’. One older male was killed by a sharp implement such as a pole axe to the head, presumably in battle. Another young male was buried in a pit with his legs raised to his chest – possibly the result of a disease. 'One of the most exciting finds was a badge with 'Morrell' inscribed, suggesting this place was an area of pilgrimage,' said Mr Score. The earliest mention of the chapel in Hallaton was in a will of 1532, but it was only found recently after research by local historian John Morrison. 'Antiquarians over the ages have referred to a chapel somewhere in Hallaton,' he told Leicester Mercury. 'It was a case of piecing evidence together and then getting in geo-physicists to take images of the land from above to locate the spot for our dig.' The excavations found the walls and tiled floor of the chapel as well as fragments of the stone masonry, tiles and lead from the windows. A number of silver pennies dating from between the 11th - 15th centuries have also been found on the site indicating when the chapel was in use. Ms Score said she hopes the dig will fill the gap in knowledge between the Roman and medieval periods. The skeletons were discovered among nine other bodies from the same period.

"A young office worker who had been suffering from anxiety and stress killed herself after becoming anxious about her hair colour, an inquest heard. Frances Warren, 26, was concerned that her long blonde hair had turned a shade of 'yellow' or 'ginger' and was desperate for it to be fixed. Miss Warren had . seen her GP a couple of weeks earlier reporting symptoms of anxiety and . stress and had been offered anti-depressants and had referred herself to . a counselling service. She was so anxious about the colour of her hair, she texted her hairdresser 50 times requesting her for help, an inquest at Avon Coroner's Court heard. Tragic: Miss Warren went missing last May, prompting desperate online appeals from friends and family . The inquest was told that immediately after an appointment . with her hairdresser at her home in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire she . disappeared - leaving her purse and handbag behind. Two days later on May 31 last year police found her body 80 miles away in dense woodland in Sedgley, West Midlands. Officers . had been searching the area off Hickmerelands Lane after her silver . Honda Civic car was recovered nearby with her mobile phone left on the . dashboard. The . inquest was attended by Miss Warren's parents, Kieran and Marjorie, . sisters Catherine and Nicola, boyfriend Sam Cotton and other family . members. In a written statement, her boyfriend Sam Cotton told the hearing: ‘Throughout the two months leading up to her death she had problems with her hair. ‘She changed her colour four or five times and had had it recoloured since March but was uncontrollably upset and wouldn’t listen when I said it was OK. It took over her life.’ Miss Warren and her boyfriend had been living together in a rented two-bed house in Bradley Stoke, near Bristol. Then . in December 2012 the couple had returned to live with their respective . parents in order to save money to go travelling for six months and then . buy a house. But the switch had reportedly upset her and she sought help from her GP, Mark Thompson. He referred her on May 14 to Lift, a psychotherapy and counselling organisation. The inquest heard both her doctor and the psychologists diagnosed depression and anxiety issues, without a suicide risk. Giving evidence both Dr Thompson and Jade Whiston, who saw Miss Warren at Lift, said she was obsessing with her hair. The inquest was told Miss Warren agreed to attend a cognitive behaviour course but refused to take her anti-depressant medication. Det Con Sue . Pesticcio, of Avon and Somerset Police, said that on May 28 - the day . before Miss Warren's disappearance - she was upset about her hair. 'Marjorie describes Frances as not being herself again. She was fretting about her hair again,' Det Con Pesticcio said. 'All of a sudden she wasn't happy with it saying it was ginger and her whole world was falling apart. 'She . said things like wishing she was dead, she hated how she looked, she . appeared to have lost all confidence and her appearance was everything.' On . May 29, Miss Warren told her mother she was not going to work because . she had been sick in the night and was still feeling unwell. Her parents . went to work, leaving her in bed. Det . Con Pesticcio told the hearing that Miss Warren repeatedly texted . hairdresser Kelly Hill asking her to come to her home and look at her . hair. Couple: Miss Warren with her boyfriend Sam Cotton, who wrote about his concerns when she went missing . Miss Warren had seen her GP a couple of weeks earlier reporting symptoms of anxiety and stress and had been offered anti-depressants and had referred herself to a counselling service . 'Kelly stated that . overnight she had received about 50 text messages from Frances wanting . her to look at her hair, so Kelly went round to see her,' Det Con Sue . Pesticcio said. 'However, Frances was not happy with the result - she was angry and wanted it changed. 'Kelly told Frances she would do her hair again but was unable to do it at that time because of another appointment. 'Kelly told Marjorie there had been nothing wrong with her hair.' Det Con Pesticcio said that the hairdresser and Miss Warren both left her home shortly before 4pm on May 29. Miss . Hill said in a statement read to the court that her first contact with . Miss Warren was on May 19 when she received a call asking her to look at . her hair because it had been cut the day before by another hairdresser . and she was not happy with it. 'I . was not doing hair that day as it was a Sunday but she seemed so . desperate to get it sorted out so I said I would come around,' she said. 'Her . hair was very blonde and it didn't look like she needed anything done . but she wanted highlights underneath and said it was yellow. Miss Warren had seen her GP a couple of weeks earlier reporting symptoms of anxiety and stress . 'As . I was doing her hair she wouldn't speak to me and said she was too . nervous. While waiting for the colour to take she walked around smoking . and appeared nervous. 'When I . finished her hair she wanted me to take photos of it in every room so . that she could see what it was like in different light. She was in my . house for around three hours before she left. 'About two hours later she returned and said it was still yellow underneath and I offered to put more highlights in. 'Later that evening she called my phone and said she wanted more highlights as her hair was still yellow. 'I told her I couldn't put anymore in but offered to put a toner on her hair to see if it would help.' Miss . Hill said that prior to the final appointment on May 29 Miss Warren had . 'continuously called' and she resorted to leaving her phone in the car . while at appointments. 'She seemed alright and joked that I must have thought she was mad,' Miss Hill said. 'She . just wanted something done to get rid of the yellow and said she wanted . to go dark instead. I told her I could put a toner on, which she could . wash out if she didn't like the colour. 'I . did warn her that it would look black to her because she was already so . white from the bleach. Once I finished her hair she looked in the . mirror and said she hated it. 'She . started to shake and appeared very stressed and freaked out by the . look. I assured her it was not permanent and it would wash out. 'She then asked me to bleach her hair but I said I couldn't. 'All of a sudden her mood changed and she became very calm and told me she just needed to go for a drive. 'I . did say to wait a few weeks and I would look at doing something with . it. I did not hear from her again but I was surprised because in the two . previous weeks she had been in constant contact.' Miss Hill added: 'I know people can be very particular about their hair but Frances couldn't just see what everyone else saw. Discovery: This is the scene where Miss Warren's car was found empty two days after she vanished . Search: The car was found in a patch of woodland near Dudley, 80 miles from her home . Investigation: Police tow the car away from the spot where it was discovered after two days' search . 'Her hair was as white as it could go but she was still positive it was yellow. I only put toner on to try and help her.' Miss Warren had also sent text messages to friends fretting about her hair. Victoria . McCullough told the hearing in a statement: 'I can recall her ringing . me and telling me it had gone orange, crying and telling me 'It's gone . ginger, hasn't it?'. 'I know she had her hair done for the third time and I said it looked really nice but I know she wasn't happy. 'During this conversation I recall her saying ""I don't want to be here"" but not for one moment did I think she was suicidal.' On . May 27, Miss Warren texted Miss McCullough, saying: 'Vic, I can't, I . just want to be dead. I really mean it. Do you want to get back with . him?' 'I was slightly confused because she talked about death then asked about my personal life,"" Miss McCullough said. 'She then said 'I really don't feel good about anything Vic, it's all taking its toll with my hair and I can't cope.' Miss . McCullough added that she never thought her friend would take her own . life over her hair and 'truly believed there must have been something . else'. The inquest heard . that Miss Warren was reported missing by her parents that evening and . she was found dead two days later. The inquest heard there was no . evidence she had left a note. A post mortem examination found Miss Warren had died from hanging. Terrence Moore, Assistant Coroner for Avon, recorded a conclusion that Miss Warren had taken her own life. He . said: 'She described herself as obsessing about her hair and I suppose . the number of calls and texts she made and the number of changes she . made and the efforts she made to get her hair changed... maybe she . wasn't wrong that there was something she felt very strongly about. 'She . felt very strongly about it and by May 29 she clearly wasn't happy. Interestingly Kelly Hill said she was calm and not at all stressed. She . had got into her car and drove off. 'She . presented to the doctors and the psychological services as someone who . was clearly depressed and anxious but not someone who was at high risk . of self-harm. 'I have to . say that I am at a loss to identify what it was that changed. I think in . the circumstances I can be satisfied without any reasonable doubt that . she took her own life.' A Facebook group set to help look for her received 7,500 followers and featured heartfelt tributes from friends as well as her boyfriend, Mr Cotton.

"Germany is rejecting demands from an EU body that it should stop surgically castrating sex criminals - a practice that dates back to the Nazis - because it is ‘degrading’. Defying Brussels, the German government said it intends to carry on with the practice citing low re-offending rates among sex criminals who had opted to have the procedure. It pointed out the results of a 1997 study that tracked the history of 104 sexual offenders 'who subjected themselves to castration in the decade between 1970 and 1980. Their reoffending rate was three per cent,' the German authorities explained, 'as opposed to 46 per cent for a control group.' The German government said it intends to carry on with the practice citing low re-offending rates among sex criminals who had opted to have the procedure . The scheme is voluntary. Against the backdrop of such results, Germany is not thought likely to buckle under EU pressure anytime soon - particularly as the country’s worst child serial killer and rapist, due to be sentenced next week, has evoked strong public support for the policy. On average there have been five such castrations every year over the past decade. A government spokesman said: 'Germany defends the procedure on the grounds that surgery helps where illnesses connected to an abnormal sex drive must be treated, or in order to counter the risk of future unlawful offences being committed by sexual offenders and/or violent offender. ‘As far as the federal government is aware, there are quite a number of scientific studies on the criminological long-term effects of surgical castration.’ There are no plans to remove it from the constitution although Berlin said it would be agreeable to talks on the issue. Germany was criticised in a report issued by The Council of Europe’s anti-torture body, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT). In its own words it regards itself as 'influential in setting the EU political agenda, but it has no powers to pass laws’. In its report on castration it said; 'The CPT must express its fundamental objections to the use of surgical castration as a means of treatment of sexual offenders. Surgical castration is a mutilating, irreversible intervention and cannot be considered as a medical necessity in the context of the treatment of sexual offenders. 'In the CPT’s view, surgical castration of detained sexual offenders could easily be considered as amounting to degrading treatment.' The EU recommends the “liquid cosh” approach - chemicals which effectively destroy a sex offender’s libido thus, goes the argument, rendering him harmless. Germany said the procedure helps treat illnesses connected to an abnormal sex drive and counters risk of future unlawful offences being committed by sexual offenders and/or violent offender . In Germany, sex criminals aged over 25 have the option of surgical castration if the operation is cleared by an expert and it stresses it is not a punishment, but an option. The programme has its roots in the days of the Third Reich when the Nazis sterilised thousands of sexual criminals - most of them forcibly. Many experiments were carried out in concentration camps to find ever quicker and cheaper ways of performing the procedures. In 1969 it was modified under the West German legal code whereby the offender must give his consent, be informed about the implications and side-effects of castration and be informed about other treatments. Nevertheless, Berlin agreed to 'examine if the issue should be discussed.' Besides Germany, the Czech Republic is the only other of the 47 Council of Europe member states which gives sex offenders the option of physical castration. Next week in Germany sees the sentencing of a youth worker called Martin Ney who has confessed to the rape and murders of three small boys and the sexual assaults of 20 others.","German government says practice leads to low re-offending rates .

"Shamed Cardinal Keith O'Brien was facing a possible police investigation last night into the sex scandal that has engulfed the church. Police received a formal complaint yesterday against the disgraced cardinal, who on Sunday night admitted he had been guilty of sexual misconduct. Last night, it emerged that lawyer Nick Freeman, well-known for representing a string of celebrities, has called on police to investigate. The latest development comes after it emerged Cardinal O'Brien - until last week the most senior Roman Catholic in Britain - has been told he must live the life of a 'hermit' following his confession. Complaint: Disgraced Cardinal Keith O'Brien is facing a possible police investigation, it emerged last night . The Catholic Church has launched its own internal investigation but Mr Freeman, dubbed ‘Mr Loophole’ for his success in helping clients avoid driving bans, said he wanted to ensure that if ‘any criminal activities had taken place they would be investigated fully’. He added: ‘After listening to the admissions of Cardinal O’Brien, I felt compelled to make a formal complaint in order to trigger a full criminal investigation. 'I was shocked to hear there is to be an internal investigation only. This will be heard behind closed doors and the full findings would not be published. 'This isn’t justice. Justice needs to be seen to be done and the Catholic Church has a moral and legal obligation to co-operate fully with any  criminal investigation.’ Mr Freeman said it was also ‘unacceptable to brush such allegations under the carpet’ in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal that rocked the BBC. A Lothian and Borders Police spokesman said the force had received Mr Freeman’s complaint. 'This isn't justice': Celebrity lawyer Nick Freeman, who has made a formal complaint to police, said it was 'unacceptable to brush such allegations under the carpet' Officers in the professional standards department will now decide if a full investigation should be launched. A police source said complaints regarding sexual allegations would normally need to be made by the alleged victim, but it is likely that the force will come under mounting pressure to examine the case fully in the wake of Mr Freeman’s complaint. Meanwhile, Cardinal O’Brien is understood to be living in a safe house in England and is not expected to set foot in Scotland again. Church insiders say he has been told by senior officials that he must now live as a shamed recluse after his dramatic statement on Sunday night. The shockwaves from the admission by the 74-year-old cleric that his ‘sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected’ also threatened to destabilise talks to select the  new Pope, which are getting under way in Rome. Shockwaves: The disgraced cardinal's temporary replacement said there was little doubt the moral authority of the Church had been dealt a 'serious blow' At Mass at St Andrew’s Cathedral in Glasgow last night, Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, Cardinal O’Brien’s temporary replacement, said there was ‘little doubt that the credibility and moral authority’ of the church had been ‘dealt a serious blow’. He added: ‘The answer to this sad episode is not to throw in the towel. We need, rather, to renew our faithfulness to Jesus Christ and to go about our business humbly.’ First Minister Alex Salmond, who publicly backed Cardinal O’Brien last week, has so far failed to comment on the cleric’s downfall – but yesterday Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill described it as a ‘tragedy’. Cardinal O’Brien, who has not travelled to Rome to take part in the conclave convened to choose the new Pope, was accused of sexual contact with young priests. Most of the allegations, which he at first denied, dated back some 30 years. Complaints were made by three priests and a former priest,  while a fifth priest is said to have written directly to the Vatican in October 2012 accusing the Cardinal of ‘inappropriate contact’ in a 2001 incident. Sources close to the complaints say he tried to have sex with the men, kissing and fondling them. One of the alleged victims is said to have contemplated suicide after being targeted by the cardinal. It is understood the former spiritual leader of Scotland’s 850,000 Catholics was spirited away from his mansion in Edinburgh’s Morningside last Wednesday night, ahead of expected  revelations about his private life. He is now staying at a secret address at a property which is not owned by the church. A source said: ‘When told how he would need to live the rest of his life, he asked, “Am I to live like a hermit?” He was told that is exactly what it amounts to.’ Insiders believe it is ‘questionable’  if the man dubbed the Cardinal of Controversy because of his condemnation of gay marriage will ever return to Scotland. A Scottish Catholic Media Office spokesman said officials expected the allegations against Cardinal O’Brien to be investigated ‘and a conclusion drawn’. In his sermon at St Andrew’s, Archbishop Tartaglia said it was a ‘sad moment’ for the Church, adding: ‘We will not forget for a long time, but we will heal and we will carry on ... As for the Church’s mission in our country, yes, our credibility and moral authority have been undermined.’","Cardinal Keith O'Brien has admitted to sexual misconduct .

"Incredible ‘magical’ trees that bear 40 different varieties of fruit have been popping up all over US. These trees - which can simultaneously produce different varieties of peaches, plums, apricots, nectarines and cherries – look ordinary throughout most of the year. But in spring, they bloom into a stunning patchwork of colours, with each tree featuring its own unique selection of stone fruit. Scroll down for video . The Tree of 40 fruit can simultaneously produce peaches, plums, apricots, nectarines almonds and cherries. Here a CGI shows what the trees will look like in spring as they become more mature . They are the work of Syracuse University sculptor and artist Sam Van Aken who created the trees in an attempt to make people reconsider how food can be produced. The project began in 2008 when Mr Van Aken discovered that a New York state orchard, which held varieties of stone fruit 200-years-old, was to be abandoned. In hopes of saving it, the artist bought the orchard, and soon after started experimenting with something known as ‘chip grafting.’ These trees look ordinary throughout most of the year. But in spring, they bloom into a stunning patchwork of colours, with each tree featuring its own unique selection of stone fruit . The trees are the work of Syracuse University sculpture and artist Sam Van Aken who created the trees in an attempt to make people reconsider how food can be produced . The process involves taking a sliver off a tree, including the bud, and inserting that into a cut in the working tree. The foreign tree part is then taped and left to heal over the winter. Mr Van Aken explained that most stone-fruits are easily compatible. The 'Tree of 40 Fruit' project was created using something known as chip grafting. The process involves taking a sliver off a tree, including the bud, and inserting that into a cut in the working tree. The foreign tree part is then taped and left to heal over winter. Mr Van Aken explained that most stone-fruits are easily compatible. Grafting is usually done in winter or early spring with dormant scion wood. What he came up with is ‘The Tree of 40 Fruit’, which is in fact, not one tree, but a series of hybridised fruit plants. So far, Mr Van Aken has created and placed 16 trees in museums, community centres and private art collections around the U.S.. In spring, the trees blossom in shades of pink, crimson and white, and in summer, they bear a range of stone fruit, as shown in Mr Van Aken's CGI image. ‘I've been told by people that have [a tree] at their home that it provides the perfect amount and perfect variety of fruit,’ Mr Van Aken told Lauren Salkeld at Epicurious. ‘So rather than having one variety that produces more than you know what to do with, it provides good amounts of each of the 40 varieties. ‘Since all of these fruit ripen at different times, from July through October, you also aren't inundated,’ he said. Mr Van Aken's trees can be seen in cities across the U.S., including Santa Fe, New Mexico; Short Hills, New Jersey; Louisville, Kentucky and Pound Ridge, New York.

"Meet Bertie, the three-year-old tawny owl that is agoraphobic. It shares a farmhouse with its owner Peter Middleton, and after its daily bath likes to dry its feathers by sitting on top of the aga. When it isn’t welcoming guests with a hoot or preening them on the sofa, it is hard at work letter shredding in the office. Bertie the three-year-old tawny owl is agoraphobic - and is far more comfortable in the home helping its owner Peter Middleton do the washing up (pictured) Multi-skilled Bertie also likes to help Mr Middleton make a cup of tea - and is fond of sitting on top of the kettle . Mr Middleton said the domesticated owl, which he adopted after it was left abandoned on the ground, hates the outdoors. He said: ‘He just doesn’t like going outside, I think it is agoraphobic. He’s not used it and he’s very comfortable in the house. ‘He’s been here for over three years and it totally and utterly domesticated now, bless him. Bertie wouldn’t last a couple of days out there.’ Mr Middleton, 56, an organic farmer in Northumberland who runs Trewitley Owl Trust, a charity which looks after around 50 rescued owls, said Bertie came to him from the local vets. He said: ‘He arrived as a forlorn mud-covered chick with infection feet. He was in a very sorry state. The domestic owl casts a watchful eye over Mr Middleton's handy work. The creature was found by the organic farmer abandoned on the ground . The creature spent the first two months of its life being cared for by vets after he was rescued. Mr Middleton said he was a ball-sized piece of fluff when he was found . Bertie takes a daily bath in a dog bowl, pictured, in the comfort of Mr Middleton's kitchen . ‘He spent the first two months of his life being cared for by the vets. He was just a tiny tennis ball-sized piece of fluff. He was becoming a bit of a liability as he was flying around, standing on top of the doors and watching everybody.’ Mr Middleton was given him to take care of and first of all put Bertie in an aviary with all the other owls. ‘He was agitated and didn’t like it so I go a big dog’s cage on my back porch and put him inside there. He has a lovely view out of the window and hoots when anyone arrives. ‘It is a bit like having a guard dog’, he said. Mr Middleton said his sister, who often visits the farm, is welcomed with a special noise. He said: ‘He’s very sweet actually, he’s a very gentle little bird. After its bath, the creature likes to settle on the aga to dry out its feathers. Mr Middleton says domesticated Bertie wouldn't last a couple of days outside . Bertie sits on the aga. Mr Middleton runs Trewitley Owl Trust - a charity that looks after 50 rescued owls . Bertie is very fond of humans and likes to preen guests to the home as they sit on the sofa . ‘He likes his house and as far as he is concerned the farm is his home. The only thing that scares him is when there are helicopters flying above – he gets a bit frightened.’ As part of Bertie’s daily routine, he has a bath in the dog’s bowl or a special tray put out for it then dries his feathers out on top of the aga, Mr Middleton explained. Its diet includes day-old chicks and mice. He said: ‘He does what owls do best, he looks around, sleeps, eats and has a bath. He dries and preens himself on top of the aga – on top of the mat – because it is nice and warm for him. ‘He has it all worked out.’ Bertie, who should live for another 15 years, lives in the farm with a pet raven – which it has not yet met – and three dogs. The creature works for its keep - and can often be founding letter shredding in Mr Middleton's office . Bertie sits in the office. Organic farmer Mr Middleton says he rarely comes in contact with other owls . ‘He doesn’t come into contact with other owls and I don’t allow the pet raven to meet him as he’s very territorial and likes to be the centre of attention. ‘Bertie is such a self-contained little animal, he stands on the back of the sofa and if anybody sitting on it, he will walk along and preen their hair. He likes to have contact with people. ‘He hoots at the dogs when we let them out but otherwise he ignores them.’ When Bertie is not busy washing itself, it assists its owner in his office upstairs. Mr Middleton says owls are sedentary by nature - and Bertie is very content watching the world go by . Bertie, who should live for another 15 years, lives with Mr Middleton's other pets - a raven and three dogs . Mr Middleton said: ‘He likes my office and either sits on my shoulder or sits on the windowsill and that way he has a lovely view onto open fields. ‘We often say how privileged we are to have him, he’s so gentle, you could trust him with a small child. Bertie is a wonderful animal. ‘He likes preening himself and he loves paper. He makes a mess in the office in no time by shredding paper. He’s also fascinated by glittery pencils.’ Mr Middleton added: ‘Owls by nature are fairly sedentary, Bertie is incredibly content sitting and watching the world go by.’","Three-year-old tawny owl, found abandoned by its owner, is agoraphobic .

"Condoms are the latest packing-list essential for those about to embark on a cruise. A new survey of 200,000 cruise passengers has revealed that prophylactics topped passengers' list of items that they must have while they're spending days or weeks at sea. Cruise.co.uk has revealed that cruise ships have become a haven for sexual activity, with 80 per cent of passengers admitting to being sexually active while on board. Scroll down for video . Eighty per cent of cruise ship passengers admit to being sexually active while on board . A survey of 200,000 cruise enthusiasts from Cruise.co.uk found that condoms are a packing-list must have . However, the company's analysis also found that while sex at sea is on the rise, sexual health products available on board cruise liners do leave something to be desired. Most modern cruise lines are simply ill-equipped to facilitate these needs, with 70 per cent failing to sell condoms on board and 80 per cent of ships not offering the morning after pill. Some cruise lines, such as Royal Caribbean and MSC, do allow guests access to condoms, pregnancy kits and lubrication. P&O, Cunard and Princess provide the morning after pill. More than 30 per cent of those surveyed about sex on board cruise ships were aged 65 and over . Another shocking find: one in five of those polled admitted to cheating on their partner while on a cruise. And what's even more surprising is that 80 per cent of those who cheated said it happened while they were on a cruise with their partner. Getting busy on board isn't restricted to younger passengers. More than 30 per cent of those surveyed were aged 65 and over. Many ships are ill-equipped - 70% don't sell condoms on board and 80% don't offer the morning after pill . A third of cruisers also admitted to bringing a sex toy on board, with nearly 12 per cent claiming that they would never take to the seas without one. Seamus Conlon, managing director of Cruise.co.uk, said: 'Following the government's recommendations towards the end of last year for older generations to take condoms on holiday and ahead of the release of Fifty Shades of Grey across cinemas nationwide, we decided to survey our database of over 200,000 cruise enthusiasts on their attitudes towards sexual health.'","A study of 200,000 cruise enthusiasts found sex at sea to be on the rise .

The Reverend Fabian Baez, a parish priest . in Francis' hometown of Buenos Aires, didn't have a VIP ticket granting . him a seat close to the altar or a spot where the pope would chat with . well-wishers. But as soon as Francis saw Baez in the crowd of several thousand people as the priest called out 'Santo Padre', the pope signaled for Vatican gendarmes to help Baez jump the barricade. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Holy hitchhiker: Pope Francis invited his old friend Reverend Fabien Baez (pictured behind Francis) for a ride in his famous white car during his weekly audience in St Peter's Square . Hugging him warmly, Francis then invited Baez to hop aboard his panoramic car.

"When Julie Deane discovered her daughter was being bullied, she vowed to move her to the £12,000-a-year school down the road. But unable to afford the fees, the housewife sat down at her kitchen table and wrote a list of ten ways to raise money. Halfway down the list she wrote ‘selling traditional leather satchels’. It was a business venture which, just four years later, would generate an annual turnover of more than £12million. Scroll down for video . Entrepreneur: Julie Deane started the Cambridge Satchel Company to raise money to send her daughter to a different school . Humble beginnings: The Cambridge Satchel Company, which was started with a budget of £600, has just opened a shop in Covent Garden . The Cambridge Satchel Company, which was started with a budget of £600, counts singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor and model Alexa Chung among its clientele. It is sold in shops including Saks Fifth Avenue, while Bloomingdale’s in New York described it as ‘the Brit It bag’. Most surreal of all, however, was when Mrs Deane was this week named in the Drapers list of the 100 most influential people in fashion – alongside the Duchess of Cambridge and Stella McCartney. ‘How weird is that?’ the 45-year-old said. ‘It is completely amazing. It is times like that when I think, “Golly, look how much farther we have come than we ever set out to”.’ The company now makes 900 bags a day and still has a backlog of orders. Star fans: The satchels have many fans among the fashion crowd including actress Elle Fanning (pictured left) and radio presenter Fearne Cotton (pictured right) Model customer: Alexa Chung is also a fan and is pictured with a blue number from the range . As the firm’s first shop opened in Covent Garden at the weekend, it is hard to believe that the multi-million-pound business began as a solution to pay private school fees. In 2008, Mrs Deane and her husband Kevin discovered their daughter Emily, now 13, had been thrown to the ground and kicked by bullies. She said: ‘Emily was eight when it became really apparent that she was being badly bullied by a group of girls. I told her, “You will not go back to that school next year. We will find you a new one and you will be so happy.” I had promised my child I would deliver and I couldn’t let her down. It was the trigger for me to start my own business.’ By chance, Emily and her younger brother Max, now 11, were reading Harry Potter at the time and had asked their mother for leather satchels similar to those worn by the book’s characters. Starting small, she found a leather supplier in Hull and asked him to make her eight chestnut brown satchels. Popular: The company now makes 900 bags a day and still has a backlog of orders . Business started slowly and she sold . just one a week at first. But, determined to make it work, she left . leaflets in doctors’ surgeries and school receptions, and taught herself . to design a website. She . said: ‘I chose satchels because I had always loved mine as a child. It . lasted me all the way through school, whereas my children’s rucksacks . became tatty and dirty within a few months.’ The . Cambridge University graduate had been enjoying life as a full-time . mother while her husband, a partner at an engineering consultancy firm, . was the breadwinner. But she immersed herself in books on how to run a . business and quickly found herself working all hours of the day from the . kitchen of the family home near Cambridge to keep up with demand. When . it became clear the satchels were not being bought by mothers but by . the fashion crowd, she began experimenting with colours, initially . adding red and green to the collection. Bright idea: Mrs Deane first thought about satchels when her children were reading Harry Potter and asked her for some similar to the ones worn by the characters in the book . Within a year she was selling to high street chain Urban Outfitters and the satchels, which range in price from £80 to £130, were championed by fashion bloggers. The business now employs 84 staff and has its own factory in Leicestershire. When asked if she always had a passion for fashion, she exclaims: ‘No, no, no. Any photos of me in the 1980s are evidence of that.’ She says the greatest reward of her venture has been fulfilling her promise to her daughter. ‘My daughter is so happy at her school. My proudest moment was when we went to get her school uniform from John Lewis a few weeks after I started the business. It was quite emotional.’","Julie Deane discovered her daughter was being bullied at school and vowed to send her to a private one down the road .

"Google has patented a smart contact lens that could see its Glass wearable computer fit inside a smart lens. The firm has already developed a contact lens for diabetics analyses their tears, warning them if their glucose levels are low. Now it has revealed plans for a lens with a camera built in - opening the possibility of its Glass system being shrunk down significantly, offering features such as 'superzoom' to wearers and even helping the blind see. Scroll down for video . Glass without the glass: Google patent contact lens camera . The Google lens contains a control circuit, an image capture (camera) component and an image sensor. The system can be wirelessly linked to a mobile phone for data access and to issue commands via audio, although it is unclear if the lens would be powered wirelessly or have a wired link to a battery. According to PatentBolt, the system could even be used to help the blind see. 'For example, a blind person wearing Google's contact lens with a built-in camera may be walking on a sidewalk and approaching an intersection,' it says. 'The analysis component of the contact lens can process the raw image data of the camera to determine processed image data indicating that the blind person is approaching intersection with a crosswalk and establish that there is a car approaching the intersection.' The lens also has wireless capabilities allowing it to link to a smartphone, which can be used to process data and give the user audio commands. Google also says the system will be able to detect faces, potentially allowing the blind to recognise people. The firm has already developed a smart lens capable of measuring the glucose level of diabetics. The technology could eventually allow Google to shrink its Glass computer (pictured) into a contact lens . Google is testing a prototype for a smart contact lens that we built to measure glucose in tears continuously using a wireless chip and miniaturized glucose sensor. The smart contact lens can measure glucose levels in tears using a tiny wireless chip and miniaturized glucose sensor that are embedded between two layers of soft contact lens material. Prototypes generate a reading once per second. Google is also investigating the potential for this to serve as an early warning for the wearer, integrating tiny LED lights that could light up to indicate that glucose levels have crossed above or below certain thresholds. 'You’ve probably heard that diabetes is a huge and growing problem—affecting one in every 19 people on the planet,' Google said in a blog post announcing the research. 'But you may not be familiar with the daily struggle that many people with diabetes face as they try to keep their blood sugar levels under control. 'Uncontrolled blood sugar puts people at risk for a range of dangerous complications, some short-term and others longer term, including damage to the eyes, kidneys and heart. 'A friend of ours told us she worries about her mom, who once passed out from low blood sugar and drove her car off the road' The project's co-founders,  Brian Otis and Babak Parviz, say they hope the technology could eventually become commonplace. How it works: The chip includes a sensor, chip and antenna to let wearers know when their glucose levels are dangerously low . The firm is already in discussion with the FDA over the project . 'We’re now testing a smart contact lens that’s built to measure glucose levels in tears using a tiny wireless chip and miniaturized glucose sensor that are embedded between two layers of soft contact lens material,' they said. 'We’re testing prototypes that can generate a reading once per second. How they are made: The process starts with a tiny chip, which is then mounted on a ring with the antenna and sensor, and finally mounted onto the lens. The technology is sandwiched inbetween two lenses . 'We’re also investigating the potential for this to serve as an early warning for the wearer, so we’re exploring integrating tiny LED lights that could light up to indicate that glucose levels have crossed above or below certain thresholds. 'It’s still early days for this technology, but we’ve completed multiple clinical research studies which are helping to refine our prototype. 'We hope this could someday lead to a new way for people with diabetes to manage their disease.' The firm is in discussions with the FDA, but says 'there’s still a lot more work to do to turn this technology into a system that people can use. It hopes to work with other medical firms to develop the lenses and other smart health monitoring devices.","Lens has camera built in .

'At first I couldn't even look at the . images of them online but as I kept researching them I realised they . weren't so bad and had quite beautiful patterns. 'Once I had got over my phobia I just cracked on with it, although before I put the skin on it looked really creepy. 'After I made him I had to keep him in a box and lock him away in a room, I just couldn't look at him. 'The . children were fascinated by the cake and weren't scared at all, but . their parents gave it a wide berth when they arrived and some of them . were quite freaked out by it. 'But then they started taking pictures. I think some loved it and some hated it. 'Everyone has told me just how real it looks.'

They come in various colours including black, brown, green and yellow and can grow to be 18 feet long and weigh more than 200 pounds. Pythons are not venomous. Instead, they kill their prey by locking it in their jaws, which boast powerful, backward-facing teeth, then crushing it in their coils. They then swallow it whole. The real thing: Burmese Pythons are among the most deadly snakes in the world and kill by asphyxiating their victims - and swallowing dead prey whole . Their success is due to their ability to gorge on huge meals - and then go without food for months. After a big kill, the snake's insides remodel themselves to cope with such a feast. Their heart grows in size to produce more blood for digestion, extra stomach acid is produced and the intestines rearrange themselves. They are also expert swimmers and can often be found in the wild near water. Some are even semi-aquatic, but can also be found in trees.","Francesca Pitcher's daughter Claudia begged her for a 'spooky'-themed party after a trip to the zoo .

"Outspoken: Father Ray Blake (pictured) condemned 'messy' street drinkers who enter his church to plead for money, branding one an 'irritating little b*****d'. A priest has launched an attack on the poor and homeless describing them as ‘lying and messy’ people sent by God to test his faith. Outspoken Father Ray Blake even said one who regularly turned up at his church pleading for money was ‘an irritating little b******d’. He accused the beggar of making a mess of his prayers as he passed his cap around his congregation looking for donations. The controversial Catholic cleric said in a blog post: 'The trouble with the poor is that they are messy. 'There is a secluded area between the church and our hall, a passage, occasionally we find someone has got a few cardboard boxes together and has slept there, and if it has been raining leaves a sodden blanket, cardboard there to be cleaned up. 'Often it also smells of urine and there is often excrement there and sometimes a used needle or two.' Father Blake, who is priest at St. Magdalen’s Church in Brighton, East Sussex, made his outburst in a lengthy blog post titled The Trouble With the Poor. He describes how the destitute 'ring the door bell at every hour of the day and night' and 'tell lies' to get cash. St Magdalen's Church in Upper North Street, Brighton, whether the controversial Father Ray Blake gives sermons to his congregation . Father Blake also singles out one homeless man who interrupts his services by launching his own collection. He wrote: 'During the silence of the Canon the man will pray aloud: ‘Jesus, I want you to bless Father Ray and God, can you persuade the good people here to give to the poor - I am poor’. 'Unchecked he will take his cap off and have a collection. It makes a mess of our prayers - it stops some coming to Mass here.' Referring to other homeless people, he added: 'They tell you their Gran is dying in Southampton and they need the train fare. 'You give it to them and if you don’t find them drunk in the street they are back the next day and the other Gran is dying in Hastings this time.' The priest ends his blog: 'My big difficulty with confession at the moment is that I have grown complacent in my lifestyle - I don’t want it changed. 'The message of the Gospels seems to be to let the poor into it to mess it up a little.' Father Blake has caused controversy before in another of his blog pieces called Feeling Sorry for Jon Venables, one of the killers of toddler James Bulger. He said it must be 'horrendous' for Venables to wake up each morning as a hate figure. In the past he has also labelled gay people 'hedonistic' and complained local politicians pandered to the 'gay lobby' and are 'ignorant of our faith'. Asked about his latest comments, Father Blake admitted he often found poor people 'quite a trial' to deal with. He said: 'We have a duty to care for the poor because it teaches us to be human. It leads us to a greater understanding. 'However I sometimes think they are sent to test my holiness. The man who comes into my church and disturbs Mass, for instance, is an irritating little b*****d.' 'You can con yourself that you love them, but they do sometimes create difficulties.' The comments come the day after Father George Gebauer, 87 from St Mary’s Church in Warsash, Hampshire said he felt sorry for gay people because they were medically ‘imbalanced’. He refused  to conduct a baptism ceremony when two women asked for their child to be christened  claiming it could be ‘illegal’ to proceed in the way they wanted.","Father Ray Blake from St. Magdalen’s in Brighton said those living on the streets were sent by God to test his faith .

"San Francisco's iconic . Golden Gate Bridge moved a big step closer to getting an oft-debated . suicide barrier after bridge officials on Friday approved a $76 million . funding package for a net system that would prevent people from jumping . to their deaths. The bridge district's board . of directors voted unanimously in favor of the funding for a steel . suicide net, which includes $20 million in bridge toll revenue. Federal . money will provide the bulk of the remaining funding, though the state . is also pledging $7 million. A tearful Dan . Barks, of Napa, who lost his son, Donovan, to suicide on the bridge in . 2008, said after the vote that he was almost speechless. Scroll down for video . This undated artist rendering provided by the Golden Gate Bridge authorities shows the proposed netting suicide barrier that is to be installed under the iconic bridge in San Francisco . A sign is posted above a crisis counseling call box on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco . 'A lot of people have done so much incredible work to get this accomplished,' he said. After . the vote, he rose from his knees and shared a tearful embrace with Sue . Story of Rocklin, whose son Jacob jumped off the bridge in 2010. 'We did it, Dan! We did it! It's no longer the Bridge of Death anymore,' she said. At . least some of the money still requires additional approval. The . bridge's board, however, has now taken its final step in adopting the . net. 'The tragedy of today is that we can't go . back in time, we can't save ... the people who jumped off the bridge. But the good thing, with this vote today, we can vote in their memory,' board member Janet Reilly said. 'We will save many lives who have . followed in their footsteps and that's what so extraordinary about . today.' The Golden Gate Bridge, with its . sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay, has long been . a destination for people seeking to end their lives. Roberta McLauglin photographs an exhibit of shoes in remembrance of people who have jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge during a commemoration of the bridge's 75th anniversary on Sunday, May 27, 2012 . Since it opened in . 1937, more than 1,400 people have plunged to their deaths, including a . record 46 suicides last year, officials said. Officials . have been discussing a suicide barrier on the bridge for decades. The . bridge's board voted in 2008 to install a stainless steel net, rejecting . other options, including raising the 4-foot-high railings and leaving . the iconic span unchanged. Two years later, . they certified the final environmental impact report for the net, which . would stretch about 20 feet wide on each side of the span. Officials say . it will not mar the landmark bridge's appearance. But funding for the project remained a major obstacle. A . significant hurdle was overcome two years ago when President Barack . Obama signed into law a bill making safety barriers and nets eligible . for federal funds. House Minority Leader Nancy . Pelosi of California in a statement Friday praised the bridge's board . and Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, D-San Francisco, who has been a staunch . supporter of a barrier. The Golden Gate Bridge district's board of directors voted unanimously to approve a $76 million funding package to build a net suicide barrier on the iconic span . 'The Golden Gate . Bridge is a source of immense pride to San Francisco, but for too many . families in our community, it has also been a place of pain,' Peloisi . said. 'A suicide prevention barrier offers a critical second chance for . troubled men and women acting on often impulsive suicidal thoughts. Together, we can ensure this magnificent landmark stands as a faithful . companion for all San Franciscans, awing and inspiring visitors for . generations to come.' Most jumpers suffer a . grisly death, with massive internal injuries, broken bones and skull . fractures. Some die from internal bleeding. Others drown. Kevin . Hines, who miraculously survived his suicide attempt after jumping off . the structure in 2000 at age 19, urged the board before its vote to ""not . let one more family sit in eternal pain, in perpetuity because of . politics."" He later broke down after the unanimous vote approving the funding. 'I . feel like a giant weight has been lifted off my shoulders, all of our . shoulders. I feel free,' Hines said. 'I feel a sense of hope that I . haven't had in a very long time. It's not over yet, we will be here . until that net is raised and no more people die.' Richard . Gamboa of Sacramento, whose son, Kyle was among the 46 bridge suicides . last year, said while Friday's vote is momentous, he's not done . fighting. Over 1,500 people committed suicide by jumping from the iconic bridge since it opened in 1937 with 46 people jumping to their death in 2013 . 'It's not over for me. I'm going to . keep coming here and urging them to get the barrier done. When I go on . that bridge and look down and see that net there, then I will be at . peace,' Gamboa said. John Brooks, whose . 17-year-old daughter, Casey, jumped from the rust-colored span in 2008, . told the board Friday that he hopes that some measure is taken before . the net is constructed to provide some kind of safety to everybody. 'What I really don't want to see between now and the time it is done is more deaths,' Brooks said. 'That will be a cruel irony.' Board . members and San Francisco supervisors David Campos and London Breed . both agreed that the sooner the barrier is built, the better. 'We need to build it as quickly as we can,' Campos said.

The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders is one of the UK's most famous regiments and began life in 1881 before going on to fight in every major conflict of the 20th century. Now part of the Royal Regiment of Scotland along with the Black Watch, the Royal Scots Borderers, the Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Highlanders, the Shetland mascot tradition began in 1928 and continues despite the merger. The first to march with the regiment was Cruachan I, a jet black Shetland pony gelding, who joined with the title of 'Pony Major'. Moving in: The Queen spent last week elsewhere because Balmoral hadn't yet been closed to the public . Enjoying the day: The Queen was all smiles as she inspected the men and their Pony Major in lovely sunshine . Cheers: A crowd of well-wishers was waiting outside Balmoral to see the Queen and the troops . Last meeting: The Queen's favourite Cruachan III and Corporal Joe Walker meet the monarch in 2012 . Cuddle: Cruachan III and his companion Islay get a pat from the Queen during a visit to their barracks . Since then, the position has been held by another three black Shetland geldings, with Cruachan III, a pony especially adored by the Queen, retiring at the grand old age of 23 in 2012. During his tenure, he made regular visits to Balmoral and led the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the Royal Regiment of Scotland, at events and parades, including the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. 'He’s done a lot of parades in his time and he was a real favourite of the Queen,' revealed handler Captain Dougie McDougall at the time of his retirement. 'If she was ever on holiday and knew Cruachan was around she would make sure he was there on the day that she arrived. She loves him to bits.' Retired: Cruachan III has now retired from ceremonial duties and spends his time munching grass in a field . Lifelong friends: Placid Cruachan III lives with his feistier companion, piebald Shetland pony Islay . Also popular: Cruachan II, the second pony to hold the title of Pony Major, also proved a favourite of the Queen's . But with Cruachan III now enjoying a peaceful retirement with his companion, a piebald Shetland named Islay, the Queen is getting to know his replacement - and certainly seemed to be enjoying the experience. Her Majesty is a long-standing fan of Shetland ponies, having begun her own riding career at the age of four on the back of another Shetland, Peggy. She is also a fan of another Scottish breed, the Highland pony, which she breeds from a stud attached to Balmoral. Well trained: Cruachan II welcomes the regiment home from Cyprus in Southampton in 1959 .

"The home that inspired one of the most famous paintings in American history could soon be in search of a tenant. If you're keen on living the quiet life in Eldon, Iowa (pop. 900) and have around just $250 per month, the house featured in Grant Wood's 1930 masterpiece American Gothic could be the home for you. The pitchfork, however, won't be included. Look familiar? The house that played backdrop to Grant Wood's 1930 masterpiece American Gothic is now without a tenant as of Monday . American favorite: The somehow equally stoic, comical and unsettling painting has become one of the most parodied works of art of all time . Isolated: The house is in Eldon, Iowa, a town of 900 . In fact, the State Historical Society of Iowa has yet to decide if they intend to again rent out the 700-square-foot 1882 home after tenant of four years Beth Howard moved out. 'There should be a statute of limitations for how long one can live in a tourist attraction,' she joked to the Des Moines Register Tuesday. Monday marked Beth Howard's last day in the house.. And who knows, you may gain artistic inspiration from the home, as Wood did and as Howard did thereafter. Wood was an Iowa painter who spotted the house while traveling through the area. He used it as the backdrop to his 1930 painting of a farmer holding a pitchfork next to his daughter. The man was actually Wood's dentist and the 'wife' the artist's sister Nan. And while not entirely non-fiction, the comically unsettling portrait is perhaps America's most parodied ever. So much so that the house that simply stands in its background has become a tourist attraction. At least initially, that didn't bother Howard. She liked the rent, kept artificially low to make up for the nuisance rubberneckers, and wanted a place to start anew after becoming a widow at age 48. She was inspired and then some, becoming known as the 'Pie Lady' for the impressive pastries she churned out in the historic home's kitchen. She also started a popular pie blog. The tourist attraction is also a home: A woman named Beth Howard lived for fours years in the house, but moved out Monday . Just a regular home...almost: Howard had to keep the windows covered nearly all the time to avoid peeping-tom tourists . Pie Lady: Howard cooked thousands of pies in the famous home's kitchen and made a name for herself, and even wrote a bestselling cookbook, while living there . Homey: Howard managed to make a name for herself as a pie maker, cookbook author and public speaker while she lived in the 1882 home . She also wrote a bestselling cookbook while in the home. But she's now gone off to greener pastures, a room with a view of cows in an equally rural part of the state, to write a book she says will be 'a memoir of the misadventures of living in a masterpiece painting with snakes in the basement.' Meanwhile, Jerome Thompson, the society's historic site administrator, said the group is weighing its options on what to do next. They may rent it out again or they may offer an artist-in-residence program. They may also allow the next-door visitors' center, which is run by the city and county, to use it. American Pie: Howard (with the pitchfork) moved into the home after becoming widowed at 48. She lived there four years and has now moved to a friend's farm, where she hopes to write a book about her time at the house .","The Iowa house that inspired one of the world's most recognizable paintings rented for just $250 per month .

"Cambodian police used cattle prods to stun workers protesting over pay at a  factory that makes clothing for U.S. sportswear company Nike - injuring at least 23 women and causing one to miscarry her baby. Police dressed in riot gear were deployed to move around 3,000 predominantly female workers who had blocked a road outside their . factory owned by Sabrina (Cambodia) Garment Manufacturing in Kampong . Speu province, west of the capital, Phnom Penh, in Cambodia today. Among the 23 women injured in the incident was a two-months pregnant worker who lost her child after military police pushed her to the ground, Sun Vanny, president of the Free Trade Union (FTU) at Sabrina said. Police clashed with around 3,000 predominantly female workers protesting over pay outside a factory owned by Sabrina Garment Manufacturing in Kampong Speu which makes sportswear for Nike (stock image) 'There was a pregnant woman among them. She lost blood and then she lost the baby,' he said. According to the International Monetary Fund, garments accounted for 75 pct of Cambodia's total exports of $5.22 billion in 2011. Low-cost labour has attracted manufacturers making clothes and shoes for Western brands but strikes over pay and working conditions have become common. This month, two workers were killed at a factory making running shoes for Asics when part of a warehouse fell in on them. Police revised the original death toll of three given by a minister. A series of deadly incidents at factories in Bangladesh, including the collapse of a building last month that killed more than 1,000 people, has focused global attention on safety in factories in Asia makes goods for Western companies. Previous incident: A Cambodian rescue team searches for missing workers after a shelter at a garment factory collapsed in Phnom Penh in Cambodia on May 20 . Poor conditions: Members of a rescue party search through rubble after thirteen workers were injured when a shelter at a Chinese garment factory collapsed . Sun Vanny said the workers making the Nike clothing had been staging strikes and protests since May 21. They want the company, which employs more than 5,000 people at the plant, to give them $14 a month to help pay for transport, rent and healthcare costs on top of their $74 minimum wage. 'Police used an electric baton to hit me on the head and if other workers hadn't pulled me away, I would be dead,' Leng Pros, a 28-year-old male worker, said from his hospital bed. 'I didn't know what happened next, I fell to the ground.' Police and military police officials declined to comment on the clash, saying they were still collecting reports. No immediate comment was available from Nike Inc. More incidents: Two workers were killed when this factory collapsed in Kai Ruong village, south of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on May 16 . Reduced to rubble: Rescue workers and soldiers search through the site of the accident in a shoe factory in the Kong Pisei district of Kampong Speu province, 30 miles west of the capital, Phnom Penh on May 16 .","Around 3,000 mostly female workers blocked a road outside their .

"New Land Rover Discovery Sport . HSE Luxury 2.2L SD4 diesel . On sale: early 2015 Price: £41,195 . GOOD . Ray Massey (pictured) tests the features on the new seven-seater Land Rover Discovery Sport in Iceland . BAD .","The fantastic flexibility of features makes this car great for families .
The car is highly rated with more emergency braking and stability control .
Only the 2.2 litre SD4 diesel version will be on sale in the UK .
Just in time for the Christmas break, I took the handsome new seven-seater Discovery Sport to Iceland — no, not the High Street frozen food chain, but a proper epic across ice and snow-covered landscapes on that Viking island south of the Arctic Circle.
We may have been promised a disco inferno near the still-smouldering volcanoes, but it was more like Ice Station Zebra on the road. I've never seen so many fur-clad parkas since a screening of the Mod film Quadrophenia.
This was no road test for sissies. I don't recall meeting any tarmac outside Reykjavik. Most of the crosscountry driving was on thick ice, thin ice, or snow. There was a constant threat of blizzard when, I'm told, visibility drops to nil. Thankfully the winter tyres and onboard safety features were up to it.
On looks alone it's a winner. It may be a replacement for the Freelander, but it's bigger, smarter, more luxurious and flexible, even though the engine and much of the underpinnings remain the same.
Great for families, thanks to fantastic flexibility. There are five seats for everyday use. But two extra ones pop up from the rear to create a magnificent seven.
The willing 2.2 litre SD4 diesel is linked to a smooth 9-speed ZF automatic gearbox and accelerates briskly from rest to 62mph in 8.4 seconds so it's pretty nimble around town and when cruising, as well as off road. Top speed is 117mph. CO2 emissions are a fair 161g/km, helped by a 'stop-start' system.
There's the option of manual override via paddles on the steering wheel. And boy did I use them as I traversed slippery glaciers and stormed up steep, snowclad hills. For winter in Britain, it'll do the job.
The hill-descent control was a godsend. It takes control of the low gearing and braking to give you a reassuringly confident descent.
It's been built with about 2ft (600mm) of wading depth, with a short overhang at the front and rear to help you cross shallow rivers and fords.
The car has achieved the top 5-star rating with more emergency braking and stability control systems than you could wave a stick at — plus a pedestrian airbag.
A comfortable and comforting interior with a commanding view of the road ahead and ample head and legroom in the back.
It goes on sale on January 22, with first deliveries set for late February.
Not the cheapest 4x4 by far and the 'extras' will soon mount up. You are paying a hefty premium for the badge and the engineering expertise behind it.
Only the 2.2 litre SD4 diesel version will be on sale in the UK, no petrol option.
There will be a 'greener' two-wheel-drive version soon, producing a 119g/km and costing less than £30,000. Great for looking the part, but frankly if you're going to buy a proper Land Rover, why have one that's not a 4x4?
The hill descent control button needs to be more prominent so you could whack it into play in transit — when you suddenly realise you need it — rather than groping to find it."
"In 1905, Albert Einstein calculated that the speed of light - thought to travel at 186,282 miles per second (299,792 km per second) - remains constant when travelling through a vacuum. He also argued that, in theory, nothing can travel faster than light. While this has been accepted for over a century, a controversial new study suggests Einstein was in fact wrong, and that the speed of light is slower than we think. The study was conducted by Baltimore-based physicist, James Franson, who looked at why light particles of supernova SN 1987A arrived 4.7 hours later than expected. The study was conducted by Baltimore-based physicist James Franson who looked at why light particles of supernova SN 1987A (pictured), which exploded in 1987, arrived 4.7 hours later than expected . The star’s collapse, which was seen from Earth in 1987, triggered a burst of neutrinos - an electrically neutral, weakly interacting elementary subatomic particle. According to Einstein, this should have happened roughly three hours before a burst of optical light - and from that moment on, the pulses should have kept pace, both travelling at the speed of light. However, the optical light arrived roughly 7.7 hours after the neutrinos - or 4.7 hours late. In 1905, Albert Einstein calculated that the speed of light remains at a constant 186,282 miles per second (299,792 km per second) when travelling through a vacuum. While this theory has been accepted for over a century, a controversial new study now suggests Einstein was in fact wrong . According to Albert Einstein, the speed of light remains at a constant 186,282 miles per second (299,792 km per second) when travelling through a vacuum. In miles per hour, light speed is around 670,616,629 mph. This means that a traveller, moving at the speed of light, would circumnavigate the equator 7.5 times in one second. By comparison, a passenger in a jet aircraft, moving at a ground speed of 500 mph (800 km/hour), would cross the continental U.S. once in four hours. The latest study suggests that the speed of light may be slower, but further research needs to be done to understand exactly how the delay is over vast distances. According to Einstein, in theory nothing can travel faster than light. The University of Maryland physicist believes the delay could have been because the light was in fact slowed as it travelled due to something known as 'vacuum polarisation'. During this phenomenon, photons break down to something known as ‘positrons’ and electrons for a split second. before combining together again. When they split, quantum mechanics creates a gravitational potential between the pair of ‘virtual’ particles. Dr Franson argues that the process might have a gradual impact on the speed of the photon, meaning that over 168,000 light years, the photons may have suffered a near five-hour delay. If the physicist is correct, it means scientists have to recalculate everything from our distance to the sun to some of the most distant objects seen in other galaxies. Dr Franson’s paper has been submitted to the New Journal of Physics and is currently undergoing peer review.

"Gorging on delicious treats to your heart's content for five days a week may sounds like a recipe for diet disaster. But according to the science behind the trendy Intermittent Fasting (IF) diet as long as you starve yourself for the other two days you will actually lose weight. Not only this but the diet craze that sounds too good to be true and is adored by super slim celebrities like Miranda Kerr claims to aid longer life and reduce risk of cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes and heart disease. Fasting two days a week and eating what you like for five is the slimline  secret favoured by Miranda Kerr . The IF eating regime  - also known as the 2:5 plan - first hailed as a wonder diet by a doctor on BBC2's Horizon is spreading like wildfire, and supermarkets are feeling the effects. Health journalist Dr Michael Mosley followed the intermittent fasting diet in the documentary Eat, Fast And Live Longer, which was watched by more than 2.5  million people. It's startlingly uncomplicated: there are no calculations, shakes, soups, pills or recipes to . follow. Simply, on two non-consecutive days in any week you consume just . 500 calories (600 for men) and on the other days eat whatever you like. After a month on the regime Mosley lost nearly a stone, reduced his body fat by about 25 per . cent and improved his blood sugar and cholesterol levels. He has now released a book on the eating regime with writer Mimi Spencer, titled The Fast Diet. Researchers have made hard-to-ignore claims about the health benefits of intermittent calorie restriction beyond weight loss, saying trials suggest it could protect against cancer, diabetes and heart disease, and neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s. In other words, it could significantly slow the ageing process. Successful TV chef Hugh . Fearnley-Whittingstall, presenter of Channel 4’s River Cottage series, . has turned to the 2:5 diet to offset his Christmas ‘gluttony’ and lost . an impressive amount of weight. And now retailer M&S has issued impressive sales figures for its lowest calorie foods. Selected meals in the company's calorie-controlled 'Count On Us' range are up 65%. The 380 calorie Green Thai Curry is proving the most popular followed by the Chilli Bowl up 58 per cent (340 calories) and Meatballs up 49 per cent (340 calories. Healthy Meals Product Developer, Elaine Kessler commented: 'We are . continually evolving and developing our healthy meals for customers, so . even when following a calorie controlled diet, they needn't miss out on . flavour or taste. 'Count on Us is the perfect . range to help people on the 5:2 diet, as it's easy to eat tasty, low . calorie meals. We're delighted with the impact on sales, and are . stocking up to make sure there's plenty of choice available.' The 2:5 diet says you have to restrict to 500 calories for two days a week but you can eat what you like for five . Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall feels 'lean and sharp' since embarking on the intermittent fasting diet . Type 1 diabetics, pregnant women, children and anyone suffering from an eating disorder should not fast. If you have an underlying medical condition, seek advice from a doctor before embarking on any weight-loss plan. There is more information on Intermittent Fasting on the NHS.uk website.

"A bitter wind blows off the Arctic Ocean but the mother polar bear and her two cubs standing just 50ft in front of me are in their element. For more than an hour I watch from a boat just offshore, transfixed and oblivious to the below-freezing temperatures, as the four-month-old twins gambol across the snow. For years polar bears have been the poster boys of global warming – routinely reported to be  threatened with extinction due to melting ice-packs and rising sea temperatures. Hope: Despite concerns about future extinction, polar bear populations appear to have stabalised . Indeed, when they were put on the US Endangered Species list in 2008, they were the first to be registered solely because of the perceived threat of global warming. One prominent scientist said their numbers would be reduced by 70 per cent by 2050 while global  warming proponents – including Al Gore and Sir David Attenborough – used emotive imagery to highlight their ‘demise’. Yet there is one small problem: many polar bear populations  worldwide are now stable, if not increasing. According to a report compiled this year on Canadian polar bear populations by academics at Lakehead University, Ontario, only one out of 13 areas showed declining numbers. In fact, in some areas numbers have steadily increased. In the Foxe Basin area in the Arctic Circle, aerial surveys show polar bear numbers have risen from 2,200 in 1994 to 2,580 in 2010, while the population in West Hudson Bay has increased from 935 in 2004 to 1,013 in 2011. Great year: This bear was photographed in Kaktovik, Alaska, where the population is growing . At the same time, a new report to be published tomorrow from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that while global warming is a fact, the situation in some areas is not as bad as was predicted in 2007. Last week I travelled to Kaktovik, Alaska – an Inupiat village of 239 hardy souls on Barter Island at the edge of the Arctic – which has become an unlikely boom town thanks to an influx of polar bears. Village administrator Tori Sims, 26, beamed as she told me: ‘This has been a great year for the bears. 'They are fat, happy and healthy. We’re seeing a boom in tourism which brings much-needed revenue to the village and helps us continue to live the traditional life we cherish. ‘I’ve lived here all my life and there are more bears every year. I read stories about polar bears being on the brink of extinction because of global warming, look out of my window and start to laugh.’ For decades, large-scale hunting had decimated the polar bear population, and in 1973 a global hunting ban was imposed. In the 1960s, Russian scientist Savva Uspenskii estimated that global numbers as low as 5,000 to 8,000. Good news: Mail on Sunday reporter Caroline Graham travelled to Kaktovik last week to check progress . But today, even the WWF cites estimates of 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears living in Canada, Greenland, the northern Russian coast, islands off the Norwegian coast, and the north-west Alaskan coast. In Kaktovik, bear numbers are embraced in the South Beaufort Sea sub-population and the most recent study by the US Fish & Wildlife Service in 2006 reported that numbers had dropped from 1,842 bears to 1,525 over the previous five years. A new study is under way with a report due early in 2014. But on Barter Island it is a more positive story: official figures have fluctuated from 51, when records started in 2002, to a pitiful ‘low’ of only 18 bears in 2010. But there were a record 80 bears . recorded last year and this year US Fish & Wildlife puts the figure . at 58, though locals believe it is higher. Carla . Sims Kayotuk, who heads the ‘nanook patrol’ which keeps the bears out . of the village in Kaktovik, said: ‘Bears come and go. They are notorious . for going long distances. ‘Authorities . say there are 58 but that’s just what they counted here in Kaktovik. They also monitored a wider area from the air and counted 91 bears. Boom town: The rise in polar bear numbers is bringing in tourists who are eager to catch a glimpse of them . ‘I took a trip outside town yesterday and came across another 20 bears. People here think there are more bears than ever.’ Others, however, disagree, and say that while Kaktovik appears to have plenty of bears, it doesn’t mean there is a healthy wider population. Guide Bruce Inglangasuk said: ‘Any idiot can see that climate change is affecting us here. There is no ice where there should be ice.’ Walt Audi, 74, a former pilot who now owns the 11-room Waldo Arms hotel, agreed. He said: ‘I’ve been here 50 years. We used to have icebergs floating offshore at this time of year and the ice would come right in, even during summer. ‘Now it’s 150 miles offshore. The bears are hungry so they are coming here looking for food until the ocean freezes and they can head back out to hunt seals.’ Those who insist the bear population is healthy are not popular. Dr Susan Crockford, an evolutionary biologist and expert on polar bears, was criticised as a ‘climate change denier’ when she published a paper called Ten Good Reasons Not To Worry About Polar Bears earlier this year. Population forecasting expert Dr J Scott Armstrong agrees: ‘The decision by the US Senate in 2008 to name the polar bear as an endangered species because of global warming was based on flawed information. 'The fact is it is almost impossible to get an accurate figure for the number of polar bears – they do not stay in one territory.’ Seeing the polar bear in the wild is a privilege – but perhaps, thankfully, no longer the rare sight we had previously been led to believe.","Polar bear populations have stablised and may even be increasing .
This is despite dire predictions of 70 per cent decline in numbers by 2050 .

"President Barack Obama spent last weekend on the golf course and on vacation in Palm Springs, California while his National Security team took charge of monitoring the increasing unrest in Iraq, it was revealed on Monday. According to reports filed by journalists on the trip of the president's comings and goings, President Barack Obama spent Saturday afternoon and most of Sunday at exclusive resorts playing golf with White House aides. Meanwhile, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and her team were tasked with coming up with a plan to stop al Qaeda linked terrorist group Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) from overtaking Baghadad. Some U.S. embassy workers were also evacuated from Iraq on Sunday while the president was out golfing. President Obama also gave the University of California-Irvine commencement address during his trip to California. Here is screaming the student chant 'Zot, Zot, Zot,' as he makes the symbols of the Anteater, the school's mascot . White House spokesman Josh Earnest assured reporters in a series of statements over the weekend that president Obama was calling Rice every evening and every morning during his trip to get an update on the ongoing bloodshed in a Iraq and the measures the U.S. could take to counter the Islamic extremist group's violent ascension to power. 'The President asked her to continue to stay in close touch and provide additional information as necessary,' Earnest said in statement on Sunday.

The first family stayed at a private residence in the gated community of Thunderbird Heights in Rancho Mirage with White House decorator Michael Smith and his partner, James Costos, the American ambassador to Spain, during their three-day stay. Early Saturday morning President Obama left Palm Springs to make a short side trip to Laguna Beach to appear at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser, where 25 of the president’s supporters donated up to . $32,400 a piece to participate in a hour-long meet and greet with Obama. Obama then gave . the commencement speech for the University of California-Irvine at Angel Stadium before returning to Palm Springs by way of Los Alamitos Army . Airfield in Los Alamitos, California. There he spent a few minutes meeting with locally stationed troops and their families before jetting back to Palm .

Obama again went . golfing on Sunday, Father's Day, with Nicholson and Paulsen at the 246-acre Porcupine Creek Estate. The president and his crew spent five hours on the golf course before retiring back to Rancho Mirage on Sunday afternoon. The President's holiday was met with indignation by Republicans who felt his attention ought to be on keeping Iraq from falling into the wrong hands. 'Well, this is a crisis. It does call for a response, not going to Palm Springs for a fundraiser, House Homeland Security committee chair Mike McCaul said Sunday morning on ABC News. 'I am glad Obama likes Palm Springs,' former California Rep. Mary Bono Mack tweeted. 'Just wish he would enjoy it after he . retires but stay focused now on the perils in the Middle East.' South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham called Obama 'delusional' and 'detached' for not taking the situation in Iraq seriously enough. 'If Baghdad falls, if the central government falls, a disaster awaits us of monumental proportions,' he said. As of Monday morning ISIL had not taken Baghdad, but it had conquered the northwestern Iraqi city of Tel Afar. President Barack Obama is taking flak for spending his weekend out on the links instead of figuring out how to save Iraq from destruction. There are no pictures available of his golf outings on Saturday and Sunday, but here is a picture of the president playing golf at the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course earlier this year while on vacation in Hawaii .

The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee has condemned a new bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gay people based on religious beliefs, sparking fears next year's big game will be pulled from the state. In a statement released today, the host committee flat-out denounced the controversial bill, saying it would 'deal a significant blow' to potential economic growth in Arizona. Arizona is slated to host the 2015 Super Bowl at Glendale’s University of Phoenix Stadium, which could be worth up to half a billion dollars for the state. 'On that matter we have heard loud . and clear from our various stakeholders that adoption of this . legislation would not only run contrary to that goal but deal a . significant blow to the state's economic growth potential. We do not . support this legislation,' the committee said, according to USA Today. Business groups are worried the National Football League championship game and its related events could face boycotts if Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signs the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, S.B. 1062. However, the NFL has not yet expressed its view of the bill, only noting the league would be monitoring it. 'Our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or any other improper standard,' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said. 'We are following the issue in Arizona and will continue to do so should the bill be signed into law, but will decline further comment at this time.' Scroll down for video . Good business? The 2015 Super Bowl will proceed as planned in Glendale's University of Phoenix Stadium. Before the veto, NFL officials said the bill would put their decision to play in the state into question . The host committee has joined other high-profile companies such as Apple and American Airlines which have hit out at the bill. Opponents claim it has the potential to allow Arizona businesses to refuse service to homosexual customers. Business leaders including Phoenix Chamber of Commerce CEO Todd Sanders and Greater Phoenix Leadership CEO Tom Franz yesterday sent a letter urging Brewer to veto the . legislation because they say it would expose businesses to a higher risk . of lawsuits and hurt efforts to attract good workers. 'We are . troubled by any legislation that could be interpreted to permit . discrimination against a particular group of people in the marketplace,' the leaders said. 'The . legislation is also already clearly having a negative effect on our . tourism industry, one of the largest sectors of the economy. The bill . could also harm job creation efforts and our ability to attract and . retain talent.' Supporters argue the bill is about protecting religious freedom, not about allowing discrimination, citing the case of a New Mexico photographer sued for refusing to take wedding pictures of a gay couple. 'This bill is about preventing discrimination against people who are clearly living out their faith,' bill sponsor, state GOP Sen. Steve Yarbrough, said. Decision time: With the clock ticking for Arizona Governor Jan Brewer (pictured) to veto, ignore or sign SB 1062, business leaders are expressing fear that Super Bowl XLIX may be pulled from Arizona next year . Arizona's recent passing of the bill has made it the first American state to pass legislation allowing people and businesses to refuse to work with or serve gays if their religion forbids or disapproves of homosexuality. The Democrat opposition called the proposal 'state-sanctioned discrimination' and an embarrassment and claimed that it would hurt the economy. 'This bill is about going after the rights of the LGBT community in Arizona,' said Representative Chad Campbell, the leader of the Democrat opposition. 'This is going to be horrible for our economy.' If accepted, the bill will put the state back into the forefront of controversial law debate, four years after the national uproar it caused with an immigration crackdown. Other states - Ohio, Mississippi, Idaho, South Dakota, Tennessee and Oklahoma - have brought in religious legislation but Arizona is the only one to pass. The bill allows any business, church or person to use the law as a defense in any action brought by the government or individual claiming discrimination. Furious: Hundreds of people in Arizona have been protesting the State Legislature's passage of the 'religious freedom bill' Celebration: Cheers erupted amid protestors of the bill after Brewer's announcement was made . The bill is backed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage. The group says the proposal is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts and simply clarifies existing state law. All but three Republicans in the House voted in favor of the bill. and the Senate passed it the day before. In 2008, Arizona voted to ban same-sex marriage but there is no guarantee that the bill will pass as Republican Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a similar measure last year. Republicans said it was simply an added protection for the faithful in the state who disapprove of gay marriage and want to be able to reject participating.","The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee opposes the 'religious freedom bill' because it would undermine economic growth .

"More than two decades after she became a household name for alleging she had a 12-year affair with Bill Clinton, Gennifer Flowers has made yet more shocking claims about the former president. Flowers, who enjoyed a lucrative modelling and acting career as well as top book sales following her announcement in 1992, has claimed that Clinton called her as recently as 2005, begging to see her. Speaking with WGNO, Flowers, 62, said was at home alone in Louisiana following her divorce when her phone rang. 'I picked up the phone and it was him,' she told host Susan Roesgen. 'And he wanted to come by my house and talk to me. I was taken aback; that was the last thing I expected.' Scroll down for video . Claims: Gennifer Flowers, who hit headlines during the 1992 presidential . campaign claiming she had an affair with Bill Clinton, has claimed in an interview with WGNO that he . contacted her in 2005 . She added that, even when she refused to allow him to visit, he persisted. 'I said, ""No you . can't come over here"",' she continued. 'He said, ""I'll put on a hoodie and I'll jog up . there"" and I said, ""No, I want you to leave me alone"". And that was that.' Former president Clinton has yet to respond to a request for comment from MailOnline over the claims. The call allegedly came decades after Flowers claimed they had a years-long affair while Clinton was governor of Arkansas. He later claimed they only ever had one sexual encounter in the 1970s. Speaking out: Flowers is pictured announcing her alleged affair with Clinton on 27 January 1992 . Controversy: Flowers speaks about the affair, which she claims took place when Clinton was governor of Arkansas, during a live television interview with CNN host Larry King January 1998 . But in another bombshell on WGNO, Flowers claimed Clinton had in fact discussed revealing the affair in the 1990s as he was struggling to achieve the recognition he needed to win the presidency. 'I made him a household name over night,' she told WGNO. 'We had had that discussion. He said, ""My problem right now is that no one knows who I am. I need that name recognition"". 'He went on to talk about the other candidates and the advantages they had... When my story came out, he was a household name.' The claims come as Flowers appeared on the show in the wake of the David Petraeus sex scandal to discuss life as the mistress of a high-profile man. Denial: Clinton, pictured in 1992 with his wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea, initially denied the claims but later admitted he had had one sexual encounter with Flowers in the 1970s . More trouble: He was later accused of having an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky . 'It's very unfortunate,' she said of the Petraeus affair. 'It does really surprise me. But there's always something like that around the corner.' To Paula Broadwell, the biographer-turned-mistress of Petraeus, she said: 'Call me Paula! I'll give you some really good advice... You'd better buck up, it's going to be one hell of a bull ride.' Of her own claims about her affair with Clinton, she added: 'I really thought that coming out and telling the truth would set me free, but it didn't.' Flowers spoke out in January 1992, as Clinton fought for the White House, and claimed she had had a 12-year affair with the married father of one during his time as governor. Life after: Flowers, pictured left in 2011 and right in 2006, went on to pose for Penthouse magazine and feature in independent films and television shows. She is about to star in a reality show in New Orleans . 'Call me!' In the interview, Flowers also warned Paula Broadwell, the mistress of David Petraeus, that she was in for a bumpy ride following the revelations about her affair . She later released tape recordings she claimed she had secretly made of her and Clinton's phone calls, although there was doubt over their authenticity. In 1998, Clinton admitted he had a sexual encounter with Flowers and added in his 2004 autobiography 'My Life' that it was only on one occasion in 1977, when he was already married. Following her claims, Flowers posed for Penthouse magazine and featured in independent films and television shows. She said her claims netted her $500,000.

"Michael Bloomberg has no doubts about where he's headed when he shuffles off this mortal coil - straight to heaven, according to the former mayor. In an interview, published on Tuesday in the New York Times, the billionaire quipped that his liberal philanthropy - including his latest plan to drop $50million battling the NRA on gun control - should guarantee him a seat in the afterlife. Bloomberg said: 'I am telling you if there is a God, when I get to heaven I’m not stopping to be interviewed. I am heading straight in. I have earned my place in heaven. It’s not even close.' Scroll down for video . Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is spending $50million to fight the NRA on gun control, said in a recent interview that his philanthropy as definitely earned him a place in heaven . Bloomberg announced this week that he plans to spend $50 million of his estimated $31billion fortune to build a grass-roots network to challenge the National Rifle Association and seek stricter gun control laws. The billionaire plans to strike fear into the powerful NRA and persuade politicians who kowtowed to gun lobbies around election time that the anti-gun lobby was equally powerful. The current groups he funds - Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America - will now be encompassed under an umbrella group called Everytown for Gun Safety. The strategy will focus on expanding the background check system for gun buyers at the state and national levels. Bloomberg told Today on Wednesday that he is not targeting Americans who want to hunt or protect themselves. Instead, he is advocating for a series of checks so that criminals, minors and the mentally ill do not gain access to firearms. The group will focus on 15 states, including pro-gun territories like Texas and where gun control initiatives have advanced. Michael Bloomberg appeared on Today on Wednesday with Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, to discuss their new campaign on gun control . It has set a goal of signing up one million new supporters this year. When asked by Today presenter Savannah Guthrie whether his goal was simply to outspend the NRA, Bloomberg said that it was 'not a battle of dollars' but for the hearts and minds of Americans, to  protect our children. The NRA declined to comment. When asked by Guthrie if he missed being mayor of New York City, Bloomberg, without hesitation replied no. He . also nixed any suggestion that he would ever run for the White House, . adding: 'I’m going to spend the rest of my life trying to make a better . world for myself, for my kids, for my grandchildren.'","Former NYC mayor said: 'I am telling you if there is a God, when I get to heaven I’m not stopping to be interviewed.

"Shot in the vast expanse of the world's largest desert, these stunning portraits of the Herero tribe of Namibia look like they're from a bygone age. But, dressed in the costumes that have been appropriated from their colonial past, the men, women and children are taking part in a modern re-enactment of their peoples' bloody history. The tribe's now traditional costumes, pictured here by Jim Naughten, are seen by anthropologists as a fascinating subversion of their former rulers' fashion, showing how the tribe survived a concerted effort by German colonialists to wipe them from the face of the earth. Costume drama: Herero woman in blue dress in cow dance pose, pictured here by Jim Naughten . Traditional dress: Herero women marching in the incredible dress of their tribe . The history of Herero clothing is extraordinary. Rhenish missionaries first introduced Victorian dress, which the tribe gradually accessorised by adding, for example, cow horn headdresses. Later, during the 1904 war with Namibia's German colonisers, Herero tribe members claimed the military uniform of dead German soldiers. Germany officially claimed their stake in a South African colony in 1884, calling it German South-West Africa until it was taken over in 1915. The first German colonists then arrived in 1892, and conflict with the indigenous Herero and Nama people began. Between 1893 and 1903, the Herero and Nama peoples' land as well as their cattle were seized by militarily superior German forces who regarded them as subhuman. Then in 1903, the Herero people learned that they were to be placed in reservations, leaving more room for colonists to own land and prosper. Voluminous: A Herero woman in patchwork dress (left) and another in a spectacular pink dress with yellow scarf . Two boys dressed as Herero cavalry cadets, complete with riding hats . Standing to attention: More Herero cadets, one in a kilt and another wearing a cardboard hat . Military uniform: Herero cavalry pictured marching in line in the desert . Looking smart: A soldier in a red beret and a man in yellow suit . By 1904, the Herero and Nama began a disasterous rebellion that lasted until 1907. During this time the Germans devised a plan to annihilate the Herero nation. Experts estimate that around 80,000 Herero lived in German South-West Africa at the beginning of Germany's colonial rule over the area. When the revolt was defeated, they numbered around 15,000. In a period of four years, approximately 65,000 Herero people perished. Those who survived, once freed from . concentration camps, were robbed of their lands, segregated from whites . and forced to work in slave-like conditions. Herero woman in orange dress, adopting the traditional cow pose . The clothes the Herero choose to wear, . both men and women, are a permanent reminder of the great scar gashed in . the tribe's history . German rule ended in 1915 when the German . army was beaten by the South African - but, once liberated, the Herero . men began not only dressing as much like their German oppressors. Herero  women also affected the styles and the airs and graces of the Christian missionary ladies who had come among them in the 1890s. At the 100th anniversary of the . massacre, German Minister for Economic Development and Cooperation . Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul apologised for the crimes on behalf of all . Germans. But the clothes the Herero choose to wear, . both men and women, are a permanent reminder of the great scar gashed in . the tribe's history when they came close to being exterminated. A group of Fumban men and boys carry some of the culture's traditional objects. Anthropologist Dr Lutz Marten said: 'Wearing the enemy's uniform will diminish their power and transfer some of their strength to the new wearer' Emperor Wilhelm II can be seen in 1989, in Germany, dismissing the replacing forces for the protection forces for German South-West Africa . Anthropologist Dr Lutz Marten said: 'Wearing the enemy's uniform will diminish their power and transfer some of their . strength to the new wearer. 'This is in part assimilation to European culture, and also in part appropriation, a coming-to-terms with, and overcoming of history and the colonial experience,' he said. Speaking about the clothes Herero women wear, he said: 'A correctly worn long dress induces in the wearer a slow and majestic gait.' Today, there are around 250,000 Herero peoples in south-west Africa and the tribe is thriving. Conflict and Costume: the Herero Tribe of Namibia by Jim Naughten, with accompanying text by Dr Lutz Marten is published by Merrell. An exhibition of Naughten's portraits of the Herero tribe will be held at the Margaret Street Gallery, London W1, from 5 March to 13 April.","Anthropologists believe the dress of the Herero tribe is a fascinating subversion of their former rulers' fashion .

"Scroll down for video . Amid revelations that the National Security Agency has the ability to intercept data going between servers and other computers, tech giant Google now says it will encrypt all messages sent through its Gmail email service to prevent prying eyes from looking at private messages. In a blog post made Thursday by head Gmail security engineer Nicolas Lidzborski, Google said that every time a user checks or sent email, it will be encryped as the data goes to and from Google's servers. Although Google has given Gmail users the ability to sign into their accouints through an encrypted connection (known as HTTPS) since 2010, Gmail will now automatically default users to the more secure network. A sign outside of Google's worldwide headquarters in Mountain View, California . 'In addition, every single email message you send or receive—100 percent of them—is encrypted while moving internally,' the post reads. 'This ensures that your messages are safe not only when they move between you and Gmail's servers, but also as they move between Google's data centers—something we made a top priority after last summer’s revelations.' Those revelations were made last year by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor, who leaked documents about global surveillance efforts used by the agency, including snooping on emails. Reports have indicated that the NSA was hacking into fiber optic cables used by tech companies to send data to and from data servers scattered around. The trouble is that the data sent through these cables is usually not encrypted, which allowed NSA spies easy access to the information being sent.

'By protecting the connection between you and Google servers, they protect you against tons of attackers,' Mikko Hypponen, a security researcher in Finland, told CNNMoney.com. However, Google hasn't NSA-proofed Gmail completely. The agency still has the ability to send out National Security Letters compelling a company to release information.

"U.S. Navy SEALs stormed a North Korean oil tanker off the coast of Cyprus last night after it was stolen and held for ransom by a mob of armed Libyan rebels. Under cover of darkness, the elite team of commandos swooped onto the The Morning Glory from a helicopter after tracking it down to a bolt hole some 18 miles southwest of the island nation. A Pentagon spokesman said they were met with next to no resistance as they swept silently through the vessel's corridors and cabins, arresting all inside. Nobody was injured in the operation. The vessel was stolen from the port of Es Sider last month by Libyan anti-Government insurgents, who are demanding a greater share of oil wealth and autonomy from the country's fledgling administration.

"Forced to march in a human chain and lined up with hands behind their heads, this is how to round up illegal immigrants Russian-style. Moscow police launched a no-nonsense crackdown on suspected illegals working on stalls in a market. Officers prodded suspects with batons and pinned them against police vans as searches were carried out. No nonsense: Immigration officers and police yesterday raided Teply Stan market in Moscow looking for illegal immigrants . This man was spread-eagled against a police bus . Tough: Out of 11 million migrants currently living in Russia, four million are believed to be illegal immigrants . Others were forced to keep their arms in the air while police looked for documents – or a lack of them. The suspects were then frog-marched on to a police bus with their hands on the shoulders of the person in front, and driven away from the Teply Stan market to face a rapid expulsion from  the country. The approach is in stark contrast to last month’s softly-softly dawn swoop by British police on an illegal camp of 63 Romanian gipsies in central London’s exclusive Park Lane. After being detained, the gipsies were offered free flights home if they agreed to leave Britain immediately. Humiliating: Once they have been searched, the suspected illegal immigrants were lined up single file and marched onto the police bus . Not happy: Looking solemn, and under the guard of a fierce looking police officer, the men are marched away . Questioning: A police officer quizzes this man as he searches his items . Only 20 accepted. The rest were allowed back on the streets after being ordered to leave the country within 30 days. Just three days later dozens were back at the litter-strewn camp, which has  been blamed for a rise in petty crime in the West End. This week’s Moscow operation was one of a string of raids on Russian markets which have rounded up more than 1,000 suspected illegals, mostly from Central Asia and former Soviet states such as Belarus and Kazakhstan. It follows an alleged attack on a policeman by two fruit sellers at one market, according to the Moscow Times. Uncompromising: The men were forced to stand still with their hands behind their heads as they waited for instructions from the police . Smiling: These detainees appear to see the funny side as they are led away by police officers . And anger over illegal immigration is such that nationalists armed with baseball bats demanded to see market vendors’ paperwork in an incident in St Petersburg. Dmitry Demidenko, of the Russian Federal Migration Service, said: ‘Some 11,193,289 immigrants are living in Russia, and 3.76million of them live here illegally. ‘We are searching for them and expel from the country as we find them.","Police and immigration officers raided Moscow's  Teply Stan market .

"Katie Bowman claims she is being harrased by police after splitting from her PC boyfriend . A forensic science graduate says her life was made a misery after she was allegedly harassed by police following a split from her PC boyfriend. Katie Bowman, who has never been convicted of a crime, claims police interest in her – which saw her stopped 70 times for suspected offences ranging from drink-driving to assault – meant she could ‘barely leave the house’. The 24-year-old alleges she was targeted over 28 months by Thames Valley Police officers from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, after splitting from Alexander Ash. Miss Bowman says that despite never . securing a conviction against her, the force has kept damaging . intelligence reports on her which are stopping her getting a job. She . has won the support of her local MP, Attorney General Dominic Grieve, . who said he was ‘seriously concerned’ by damning comments held on file . about her, which he said bordered on ‘trivial’. Miss . Bowman claims the harassment started in earnest in 2007 when she was 18 . and PC Ash, also based in High Wycombe, was disciplined by his force . for making inappropriate contact with her after their split. PC . Ash, who denies ever having been in a relationship with Miss Bowman, . said this disciplinary action instead related to drunken behaviour on a . night out with friends. Papers . obtained by Miss Bowman’s family suggest that more than ten of the 40 . intelligence reports on her were filed by a friend and colleague of PC . Ash. Following . court action by her family, Thames Valley Police launched a review last . year and earlier this year and removed 20 of the reports. However, . the Bowmans have vowed to take legal action to clear her name fully. They also hope to bring the officers they claim are involved to justice . and to seek compensation. Miss . Bowman, now engaged and expecting her first child, says she was . breathtested 70 times – 54 in one year from September 2007. Each time . the result was negative. She . was stopped on suspicion of possessing drugs and given a caution for an . alleged assault – later rescinded after a professional standards . investigation. Her car was seized eight times, and she was given . disorder penalty notices. Miss Bowman, 24, alleges she was targeted over 28 months by Thames Valley Police officers from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, after splitting from PC Alexander Ash (file picture) Her . father Brian Bowman, from Hertfordshire, said: ‘Katie could barely . leave the house without being stopped. Her life was made an utter misery . by a gang – but a gang in police uniform.’ Miss . Bowman says that, with the support of Mr Grieve, she has repeatedly . complained to the force. She has successfully challenged the more . serious allegations which would have led to a criminal record. Mr . Grieve has written to Thames Valley Chief Constable Sara Thornton . twice, branding the reports kept on Miss Bowman as ‘entirely lacking in . substance’. He told the Mail: ‘I am very concerned, her allegation is of . a serious nature.’ One . intelligence report alleges a set of blue LED decorative lights placed . pointing into the footwell of her car amounted to unlawfully displaying . emergency blue lights. Despite . never leading to an arrest, the claims showed up in CRB checks and cost . Miss Bowman her job as an ambulance call handler in 2007 and saw her . sacked from another job as a student paramedic three years later. It . also stopped her becoming a special constable in 2011. In . his letter to the chief constable, Mr Grieve said she ‘is a person of . good character... adversely affected by the numerous derogatory comments . made about her by police’. Having met Miss Bowman twice, he found it ‘difficult’ to match up the image of her as ‘the wayward teenager’ portrayed in police reports. He also raised concerns that the possible motive for the police’s conduct is that she was being punished for getting PC Ash in trouble. Last night PC Ash, 31, who married recently, said: ‘I met her on a night out about six years ago and again when she came for an open day for prospective employees who want to join the force.’ The roads policing officer added: ‘I think she was upset because I wouldn’t go out with her and made several allegations about me. I have absolutely no idea why she would say we were an item.’ Thames Valley Police said: ‘The need to retain the intelligence reports relating to Ms Bowman was reviewed in 2012 (following which a number were removed) and in 2013 following further requests made on her behalf. ‘Thames Valley Police will not be commenting on the details of  the reports, but we seek to comply with all aspects of the Data Protection Act and the national standards for the management of police information.’ The force said it had investigated a complaint from Miss Bowman in 2009 that ‘officers from High Wycombe have harassed her by causing her to be stopped, arrested, her vehicle seized and maliciously prosecuted’. It added: ‘The complaint was found to be unsubstantiated and Miss Bowman’s appeal to the IPCC was not upheld.’","24-year-old claims Thames Valley Police targeted her over 28 months .

"Most women change their hairstyle following an emotional break-up, but one woman went about changing her appearance in a much more dramatic way. When feisty Amanda Brignall hit a mid-life-crisis she decided to cover her body in tattoos - but now she can’t get a man because her appearance scares them off. The mother-of-two’s ink obsession started at 37 after she separated from her husband and her children flew the nest. Scroll down for video . Tattooed lady: Amanda Brignall covered herself in tattoos when she hit a midlife crisis. After she divorced from her husband, she covered 80 per cent of her body in ink . Since then she’s dramatically changed her ‘mumsy’ look - adding a new design to her skin almost every week. Now 80 per cent of her body is covered - including her face. The 49-year-old, from the sleepy town of Beverley in Yorkshire, says she has no regrets - but not everyone loves her tattoos as much as she does. Known as ‘the freak of Beverley’, she hasn’t been in a relationship for the past seven years. Regrets: Although she originally inked herself to make herself feel less 'mumsy', she is now regretting the decision because she can't get a man because her appearance scares them off . She said: 'I love my tattoos but men don’t seem to feel the same. My appearance seems to scare them off. 'I’ve only ever been on one date in seven years. That was through a tattoo-lovers dating site - but it didn’t last. 'I think when men first look at me, they think I’m a bit rough. They mutter ‘look at the state of her’ under their breath. They don’t bother to get to know me.' Amanda is proud of her tattoos and never covers them up - apart from when she visits her 80-year-old mother. Where it all began: Amanda, who suffers from . osteoporosis and is currently unemployed, got her first tattoo done when . she was 18 (pictured, L, age 28, and R, age 19) Taunted: She is known around her hometown as 'the freak of Beverley' so she got 'Talk to the hand' scribed on her palm to fend off negative comments . Proud: Despite the negativity, she is proud of her looks and only covers her tattoos up when she pays a visit to her 80-year-old grandmother . She said: 'The only place I haven’t got tattooed is my bum and that’s because I don’t see the point - afterall, who’s going to see it? 'But my mum hates my tattoos, so whenever she comes round I wear a jumper and scarf. It makes me feel a bit like a teenager but I prefer to avoid rowing. But besides her, I won’t cover up for anyone.' When Amanda’s marriage came to an end after 10 years, she moved to the small market town of Beverley to live near her parents. She said: 'I started working in a newsagents where I met a local tattoo artist. She specialised in designs of pin up girls, and one day I thought - ""I want one of them"". 'My dress and hair had always been quite normal before, but I felt like a change. I’d always been a bit mumsy - wearing baggy jumpers, leggings and no makeup. Time for a change: When Amanda's marriage came to an end after 10 years, she moved to the small market town of Beverley to live near her parents and underwent a style makeover . Addiction: She became addicted to getting tattoos, especially after becoming close friends with the artist and getting them for free (pictured here with tattoo artist Jimmy at a Tattoo Parlour in Yorkshire) 'But I wanted to add a bit of glamour into my life. I had Marilyn Monroe done, then Bettie Page. 'I loved the way they looked so feminine. After all, I like to make an effort. There’s no way I’d go out of the house without any makeup on.' Amanda admits that tattooing became an addiction after the tattoo artist became a close friend and offered to ink her for free. She said: 'Once I started, I couldn’t stop - it became an addiction.' Three years ago, Amanda decided to start dating again. She said: 'I didn’t think there was much chance of meeting the man of my dreams in Beverley, so I went on nights out in Hull to Spiders Nightclub. What a difference: Amanda thinks she had always been a bit mumsy - wearing baggy jumpers, leggings and no makeup (pictured, L, 25 and, R, 38) 'I felt more at home there, and people would come up to me and tell me how amazing my tattoos were. But often, that’s as far as the conversation went.' So Amanda decided to sign up to a dating website for tattoo lovers. She said: 'I knew I wouldn’t have much luck with normal men because I don’t think they like to be seen with a tattooed woman, so I decided to try and hit it off with people like me. But I only went on one date, and the guy only had one tattoo. I wasn’t very impressed.' Over the years Amanda has become so disheartened that she is ready to give up on the dating game. She said: 'I don’t think there’s much chance of me being in a relationship now. 'But I don’t regret getting them done. I think people should be able to see past the tattoos and accept who the person is on the inside and not on the outside.' Out and about: She says people would come up to her and tell her how amazing her tattoos were. But often, that's as far as the conversation went . Amanda, who suffers from osteoporosis and is currently unemployed, got her first tattoo done when she was 18. But it wasn’t until her marriage ended in divorce and her two sons, aged 24 and 21, left home, that her obsession snowballed. She said: 'I had a bit of a midlife crisis. I got to 44 and realised that my marriage was in tatters. I was also unemployed because I’d developed osteoporosis in my back. I felt old and rejected. 'But then I started getting more tattoos done and every time I got inked, I felt a new lease of life. Now people look at me and they can’t believe I’m nearly 50.' She added: 'I get a lot of negative responses. People are really judgemental. They call me ‘the freak of Beverley’. But at the end of the day it’s just small-town mentality.' Covered: The only part of her body where she doesn't have a tattoo is on her bottom because she 'doesn't see the point' The abuse got so bad that Amanda even had ‘talk to the hand’ tattooed on her palm, now she shows it whenever she gets a negative comment. She added: 'I did worry what people would think, but then I thought, so what, it’s my body, not theirs. Mum wouldn’t speak to me for days afterwards though, and dad’s just given up on me. 'Sometimes I do worry that my tattoos will affect my ability to get a job in the future, because I do think employers judge you on your appearance. But I don’t have any regrets - it’s all worth it.' Now her eldest son Ben Clarkson, 24, who is a cobbler, is following in his mum’s footsteps - he has had 40 tattoos done. Meanwhile her youngest son Max Clarkson, 21, who is a hairdresser, has just experimented with a tiny star. Amanda said: 'It doesn’t bother me that my boys have had tattoos done - that’s up to him. As long as they don’t offend anyone. 'Sometimes I worry that he’s getting the same abuse that I do, but then I remind myself that he can look after himself. I’m just glad that he’s brave enough to be individual, just like his mum.'","Amanda Brignall, 49, hit midlife crisis at 37 and turned to ink .

"Five British troops, including personnel from Prince Harry’s former Army unit, have been killed in the UK’s worst helicopter crash in Afghanistan. The tragedy happened when the Lynx helicopter, believed to be on a reconnaissance mission, came down in a mountainous Taliban stronghold close to the Pakistan border. Soon after the crash at 11am local time, Taliban insurgents claimed they had shot the helicopter down with a rocket. Dangerous work: A Lynx MK 9 helicopter flying over the desert in the Helmand province, Afghanistan (file picture) The Lynx helicopter and crew were believed to have been based at Kandahar airfield. The crash occurred near the Pakistan border at 11am local time . But military sources told The Mail on Sunday that the British-made helicopter, which has an excellent safety record, suffered a catastrophic technical failure and that no enemy action was involved. Those killed are thought to be two passengers and three crew members from the Army Air Corps, the unit Prince Harry belonged to when he flew Apache helicopter gunships in Afghanistan last year. Last night Royal sources said the Prince was deeply concerned to hear of the incident. Lynx helicopters are flown exclusively by the Army Air Corps but with some Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel on attachment. The Ministry of Defence said last night that it had completed a provisional identification of those who died. There was speculation last night that some of those on board may have been special forces. It is the first time British helicopter crew have been killed in more than a decade of flying in Afghanistan, and comes just months before all combat troops on the Nato-led mission pull out of the country. The crash brings the total number of UK personnel lost in Afghanistan to 453. It was the most deadly air incident involving UK forces since 14 personnel were killed when an RAF Nimrod crashed in 2006. Prince Harry served in 2012 with the Army Air Corps, above, and some of his comrades are thought to be among those killed in the helicopter crash . Last night the families of those who lost their lives were being informed by MoD welfare officers. Meanwhile, in Afghanistan the crash site was sealed off by troops as an investigation got under way into the circumstances behind the tragedy. The MoD said: ‘We can confirm that a UK helicopter crashed in southern Afghanistan. The incident is under investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment until families have been notified.’ A spokesman for the Nato operation, known as the International Security Assistance Force, added: ‘Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends affected by this tragic event.’ The helicopter crashed near a village in the Takhta Pul district, near Kandahar city in south-east of Afghanistan, and only a few minutes’ flying time from the helicopter’s base. There were no reports of enemy activity in the area of deserts and mountains, which is outside Britain’s main theatre of war in Helmand. But Kandahar remains volatile and one Taliban spokesman claimed in a text message to local journalists that the ‘mujahedeen’ had brought the helicopter down with a rocket launcher. Insurgents also wrote online that the ‘wreckage caught fire as it smashed on to the ground, killing all invaders onboard’. But local officials insisted the crash had been a tragic accident. Zia Durrani, the provincial police spokesman, said: ‘A helicopter belonging to Nato troops has crashed. It was doing military exercises and crashed as a result of technical fault.’ A spokesman for Kandahar’s governor also said the ‘helicopter crashed due to technical problems’. An inquiry will be carried out by the Military Aviation Authority to establish the cause of the crash. The Lynx helicopter and her crew were believed to have been based at Kandahar airfield. The base is home to 657 Squadron Army Air Corps, which flies the Lynx in an escort role protecting transport helicopters such as the Chinook and Sea King which are more vulnerable to attack from Taliban gunmen. Those killed are thought to be two passengers and three crew members from the Army Air Corps, the unit Prince Harry, above, belonged to when he flew Apache helicopter gunships in Afghanistan last year . There are 2,000 serving personnel with Army Air Corps, including  specialists from the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers who repair helicopter, and officers, such as Prince Harry, who are attached from their own regiment – in his case the Household Cavalry. 657 Squadron, belongs to 7 Special Forces Group, a unit supporting the SAS and SBS. Lynx helicopters, made by Westland in Yeovil, are the world’s fastest and can reach speeds of 185mph. A decade ago four Royal Navy servicemen died when a Lynx ditched into the sea off Cornwall. And in May 2006 five UK personnel were killed when a Lynx helicopter crashed in Basra, southern Iraq, after it was struck by a surface-to-air missiles fired by insurgents. Following the crash, a board of inquiry made key safety recommendations that were never made public for security reasons. But until yesterday no British troops had been killed in helicopter crashes in Afghanistan. In three earlier Chinook crashes and an Apache emergency landing, all those aboard survived. In December six US soldiers were . killed when their Black Hawk crashed in Zabul, while 30 US troops and . eight Afghans died when their Chinook was shot down in 2011. About 5,200 British troops remain in Afghanistan, out of a total Nato force of 51,000. All combat troops are due to withdraw by December. Above: Camp Bastion . Richard Kemp, former commander of British troops told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is obviously a tragic incident and it reminds us that operating in places like Afghanistan our soldiers face enormous risks, even if they’re not fighting the Taliban. Sometimes they have to fly helicopters in conditions that no civilian would, such as evacuating casualties or delivering supplies. ‘I would certainly pay tribute to the bravery of anybody who is prepared to put their life on the line like that.’ He said in hostile territory helicopter pilots often had to fly at great speed or close to the ground, often hampered by dust storms. About 5,200 British troops remain in Afghanistan, out of a total Nato force of 51,000. All combat troops are due to withdraw by December.","Five British troops killed in UK's worst helicopter crash in Afghanistan .

"Steve Elkington, a professional golfer, has come under fire for remarks he made on Twitter about openly gay fellow sportsman Michael Sam. The comments from the Australian PGA winner come just two weeks after the college star came out. On his personal account Elkington, 51, tweeted 'ESPN covering Michael Sam as a a gay athlete is embarrassing ... ' Championship golf player Steve Elkington has made comments about fellow sportsman Michael Sam on his Twitter account . And then he posted, 'I'm for Sam I'm against ESPN telling me he's gay ...' The PGA chamionship winner then continued, 'ESPN reporting Michael Sam is leading the handbag throw at NFL combine No one else expected to throw today.' However the tweets posted yesterday were later removed. It is not the first time that the Australian golfer has made inappropriate comments on the social media site. Last year, he wrote words of a racial nature on Twitter during the Senior British Open.and quarrelled with golfer Ian Poulter. His comments came after Washington lobbyist Jack Burkman said he would be drafting a bill that would ban gay players from joining the National Football League. Mr Burkman said he came up with the idea after Sam publicly came out a few weeks ago. In a statement, he said: 'We are losing our decency as a nation. Imagine your son being forced to shower with a gay man. 'That's a horrifying prospect for every mom in the country. What in the world has this nation come to?' 'Horrifying prospect': Washington Lobbyist Jack Burkman (left) said he was prompted to draft a bill that bans gay players from the NFL after college star Michael Sam (right) came out a few weeks ago . Michael Sam faced a crowded press conference during the 2014 NFL Combine at Lucas Oil Stadium . Burkman, the founder and president of . JM Burkman & Associates, said he has political support for the . legislation, but his statement did not name specific lawmakers. Urging Congress to act, he added: 'If the NFL has no morals and no values, then Congress must find values for it.' JM . Burkman & Associates, which signed 70 new clients last year, . specialises in helping companies secure contracts with the federal . government, it was reported by The Hill. On Saturday, . Sam, the NFL's first openly gay draft prospect, appeared publicly at the . league's scouting combine -- and during a press conference said he . would be excited if drafted by the Miami Dolphins which has recently . been subject to a bullying scandal. Wearing a rainbow with the words 'Stand with Sam' on a pin given to him by a fan, he said: 'If the Miami Dolphins drafted me I . will be excited to be a part of that organization, but I'm not thinking . about going into that environment.' 'I know how to handle . myself. I know how to communicate with my teammates,' he continued. 'I know how to . communicate with the coaches and know the staff, whoever I need to . communicate with.' 'If someone wants to call me a name, I will have a conversation with that guy and hopefully it won't lead to nothing else,' Sam said . Sam also said he was surprised by the support he received from staff and students at the University of Missouri, who he says have come up to him on campus to hug him . He also said that he would confront other players . if they had issues with his sexual orientation. 'If . someone wants to call me a name, I will have a conversation with that . guy and hopefully it won't lead to nothing else,' Sam said. Sam also was open about the media's interest in his sexuality. 'Heck yeah, I wish you guys would . tell me, ""Michael Sam, how's football going, how's training going?""' 'I . would love for you to ask me that question, but it is what it is.' 'And I just wish you guys would see me as Michael Sam, the football player, instead of Michael Sam, the gay football player.' Sam said he was 'kind of surprised' the support he received at the University of Missouri since coming out. He described being hugged and kissed by faculty and students on campus. 'A lot of people want this. There's just a lot of support out there,' he said. When asked if he felt like a trailblazer, Sam said 'I feel like I'm Michael Sam.' Though there has been some doubt over what position Michael Sam would be drafted for, he explained that he is simply a pass rusher. He listed ex-NFL player Michael Strahan as an example of a good pass rusher but that he wanted to make a name for himself. If drafted, Michael Sam will be the first openly gay football player in the NFL . Sam recently also sent his father a text with two words: 'I'm gay.' Michael Sam Sr said he had no idea of his son's sexuality but that he fully supports the University of Missouri star's decision to come out. The dad even made light about the revelation, initially, according to NBC news, saying: 'Well, you could have wished me a happy birthday first.' The 55-year-old, a disabled truck driver who lives in a nursing home in Texas, said his son called him later in the evening to talk about it. 'I was shocked because I didn't see it,' the father told NBC. 'I mean, you see your kids, but you don't suspect that. 'I said was he sure, and he said he was. 'He's in control and he's grown. No matter what, he's my son and I still love him.' Proud: Michael Sam's father said Monday that, while he didn't know his son was gay, he loves him no matter what . Strong: Missouri senior defensive lineman Michael Sam speaks to the media during an NCAA college football news conference in Irving, Texas. Sam says he is gay, and he could become the first openly homosexual player in the NFL . The proud father said he has no doubt his boy is capable of weathering any criticism he might face, adding that from an early eage Michael 'wanted to make something of himself'. Sam Sr has joined a chorus of support for the brave decision made by the defensive linesman, who could become the first openly homosexual NFL player if he is selected for the league later this year. Michelle Obama, along with some of the biggest names in the NFL, have also sent congratulatory messages. 'You're an inspiration to all of us,' the first lady wrote to Sam on Twitter. 'We couldn't be prouder of your courage both on and off the field.' 'Thank you for your kind words,' he responded. 'Humbled by your support.'","Elkington wrote remarks on Twitter before deleting them .

"Sergeant Percy Buck was only 26 when he died at Passchendaele in 1917 . With the Battle of Passchendaele raging around him, Sergeant Percy Buck - dying from a fatal wound - clutched a picture of his family. On the back, he had written his dying wish, that someone would return it to his wife. He would have hoped one of his comrades would fulfil the request, it can't have crossed his mind that it would be honoured by an enemy - let alone the one who had killed him. However, this is the incredible story that has come to light now the soldier's grandaughter has unearthed the photograph among her father's belongings. Christina Reynolds, 58, has uncovered the black and white photo almost 100 years after it was taken. It pictures the soldier with his wife, Bertha, and son - Mrs Reynolds's father - Cyril. Along with the photograph, Mrs Reynolds found the devastating telegram that informed her grandmother of her husband's death and a letter from the German soldier, explaining the picture's incredible journey from the Western Front back to Mrs Reynolds in Hitchin, Herts. Mrs Reynolds, whose late father was only three when his Sgt Buck died, said: 'My father barely knew his father but he had these items in a box. 'The box has been passed down to me and in it were these letters by the German soldier and the Red Cross explaining the return of the photo to my grandmother in 1917. Photograph taken on the same occasion as the one returned by the German soldier. (Back row, left to right) unknown, Percy Buck, brother Ted Buck (front row) Bertha with son Cyril and Bertha's mother Mrs Stevens . A translation of the letter sent by Gefreieter Josef Wilczek to the Red Cross . The letter sent by the Red Cross to Bertha Buck along with her husband's photograph . 'It was this German soldier who probably killed my grandfather in an act of war. 'He didn’t have to take the time out and maybe risk punishment to fulfil my grandfather’s wishes. He could have left it there. 'The two men didn’t know each other but it was very kind of him to do what he did for a fellow soldier.' The German who recovered the poignant image from Sgt Buck's body was Gefreiter Josef Wilczek - Gefreiter is an army rank for enlisted soldiers equivalent to a private. In a remarkable act of humanity, Gefreiter Wilczek sent the photo to the Red Cross in Geneva along with a forwarding note. He wrote: 'He was holding the card in his hand and the finder was asked to forward it to his wife. I, wishing to fulfil the last will of the dead comrade, send it to you. 'May he rest in peace.' Percy Buck, far right, pictured with his fellow soldiers in the Hertfordshire Regiment . A recent photograph of the area where Sgt Buck received his fatal wound . However, in a sad twist, by carrying out the stranger’s final wish, Gefreiter Wilczek may have deprived Sgt Buck of a war grave for his family to visit. The photo would have been a key item that would have helped identify his body. It is thought Sgt Buck was instead buried in an unmarked grave in Flanders. Sgt Buck served in the Hertfordshire Regiment and trained troops in rifle practice before being sent to the Western Front in December 1916. In July 1917, the men took part in a major dawn offensive in the Third Battle of Ypres, known as  Passchendaele. The night before the men went over the top, Sgt Buck wrote the request on the back of the photo and showed it to a colleague. The letter that officially informed Bertha Buck of her husband's death. His body has never been found . The next morning his battalion were at St Julien at Flanders and came under heavy machine gun fire which caused them to conduct a fighting withdrawal. Sgt Buck was shot in the side and fell into the shell hole. Until now, Sgt Buck's family have not known the details of his death but, with the help of the Herts At War project, set up to mark the centenary of the First World War, Mrs Reynolds has been able to fill in the blanks. As a result of her coming forward with the documents, researchers for the Herts At War team have uncovered an eye-witness account of Sgt Buck's death. In 1918, a Private Ramsell told the Enquiry Department for Wounded and Missing: 'We went over the top together at St Julien front. 'I did not see him (Percy) hit but several other fellows did. He was hit in the side and fell into a shell hole. He was too severely wounded to move. 'He showed me a photo of his wife and child the night before. On the back of it he had written his wife’s address and the words ‘whoever finds this please forward’, or words like that. 'We never saw him again and his body was never found.' Mrs Reynolds said: 'All the family knew was that my grandfather was missing in action and then confirmed as killed in action. 'His body has never been found and we have never really known what happened to him until now. 'We still don’t know where he is, only that he is buried out there somewhere. 'I just wish my father was still alive today because he would have wanted to know.' Dan Hill, of the Herts at War . project, said: “We are covering 20,000 different stories and this one . stood out because it was an incredible moment of humanity in the carnage . of war. “It . was right in the thick of the action and this one German soldier took . it upon himself to do a dying comrade this remarkable favour.” Sgt Buck was aged 26 when he was killed. His widow Bertha, who he married in 1912, died in 1962. Gefreiter Wilczek did not survive the First World War either, he was killed on October 31, 1918, just two weeks before the Armistice.","Return of photograph was British soldier's dying wish .

The suspect hasn't been named, but is described as in her 20s and has been arrested for suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and causing great bodily harm. She was identified thanks to video footage of the attack filmed by a bystander. Scroll down for videos . Attacked: Kim Pham was knocked to the ground and beaten by a group of men and women outside a club in Santa Ana, California early on Saturday morning. She was left brain dead after the attack . Plea: Posters put near the crime scene appealing for information about the tragic January incident . 'People have come forward that have provided us with videos and have come in and provided statements that have given detectives enough information to believe that this person was involved in at least the physical part of this altercation,' said Santa Ana Police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna of the suspect. Police are still looking for the four other suspects - two woman and two men - who are believed to have been involved in the heinous attack. On Facebook, Kim's sister Katie described her as a ‘beautiful, eloquent, and respectful person.’ Authorities are urging witnesses or anyone with any information about the attack to come forward. Downtown, Inc., a group of local Santa Ana leaders, business owners and residents, and representatives from the venue where the incident took place are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrests of the individuals responsible for Pham's attack. She was waiting with friends outside The Crosby, a club in downtown Santa Ana, when an argument broke out with another woman, whose friends then stepped in. Brutal: A video that friends claimed showed the attack was shared on Facebook. It shows people trying to break up a fight in the street while someone is lying on the ground . 'Two or three of the female suspects knocked her to the ground, were . physically assaulting her and kicking her, and they fled the scene,' Santa Ana Police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna told KABC. CBS .

Hours later, her sister shared a link on Facebook saying that her sister had been murdered. Santa Ana Police have not yet confirmed Pham's death. But authorities are appealing for witnesses to come forward with footage of the attack after receiving reports that club-goers had taken out their cell phones. One video posted on Facebook claims to be from a friend of the victim, although authorities have not yet confirmed its veracity. The 10-second clip shows a person lying on the floor as they are surrounded by a group of people. A guard can be seen attempting to separate the crowd as witnesses look on, horrified. Bertagna added that authorities were looking for 'a group of five individuals that . are only described as three females, two males, all Hispanic between 20 . and 25 years of age'. Scene: Investigators swarm the scene after the tragic fight ended in the death of Kim Pham in January after an ugly altercation outside a trendy nightclub .

Memorial posters and flowers were placed outside the club, and friends and relatives spread posters online pleading for information into the attack. A donation page was also set up for the family, but Pham's sister later said that they did not want to receive donations and would be returning the money. ‘I can't believe something like this would happen to someone, especially my cousin,’ said Kathleen Trinh. ‘She was always a fun loving person. She has a bubbly personality. Anyone that's around her is always happy, she has an uplifting spirit.’ Pham's friend Johnson Lam described her as 'really educated, smart.' 'She has a lot of friends, you know, and everybody loves her, everybody likes her, and she's very sweet and kind-hearted,’ she said, .

"Directory: George McCoy's controversial book lists the contact details, specialisms, working hours and charging policies of almost 600 sex workers in the capital . A book entitled 'A Guide to the Working Ladies of London' was at the centre of a police prostitution probe today after selling 500 copies on Amazon. Police officers have been asked to investigate the new directory which ranks prostitutes on a five-star scale. The book lists the contact details, specialisms, working hours and charging policies of almost 600 sex workers in the capital. The £10 directory has sold more than . 500 copies, according to author George McCoy, 63, a retired vinyl record . seller and veteran reviewer of sexual services. However, Kit Malthouse, deputy Mayor . of London with responsibility for policing, said he would ask the Met to . investigate the legality of the book. He said: 'It strikes me that reviewing human beings in the same way as a restaurants is repellent. 'The thing people forget is that . the world of organised prostitution is also a world of organised crime, . drug dealing and abuse. Anything like this that tries to sanitise it is . revolting.' Mr McCoy, . who has also written a book called Guide to the Agencies, Corrective . Services and Parlours of London, said he took all the measures he could . to ensure those listed work of their own free will, and had no moral . qualms about his work. He said: 'I think we have far too many people in this world telling us how to behave. 'Obviously we want to give a good example to the youth of the country, but you should be free to do what we want as long as it’s not going to harm anyone else.' He said he’d sold copies to 'gentlemen, including viscounts and knights of the realm,' and police would be wasting their time if they investigated. Police probe: The new directory by George McCoy, pictured, ranks prostitutes on a five-star scale . He said: 'There have been far more blatant cases that have been taken to court and people were found not guilty. 'I’m not saying it’s legal, but all . sorts of things are illegal. It’s a question of whether it’s in the . public interest to take me to court.' A Met Police spokesman said they would consider investigating when they received information from Mr Malthouse. Mass market: The book which police are being asked to investigate is currently for sale on Amazon . A spokesman said: 'The Metropolitan . Police Service’s human exploitation and organised crime command responds . to, and builds up, intelligence pictures in areas of the sex industry . where the most harm may be done. 'Our primary aim is to make London a hostile environment for traffickers and those who exploit people to operate in.' Mr McCoy used personal experience, . newspaper adverts and the internet in his attempt to research and rank . every individual working lady in London. Detailed: A page from 'A Guide to the Working Ladies of London' which highlights the work of a woman in Morden . He edits four specific guidebooks, . McCoy’s British Massage Parlour Guide, McCoy’s British Escort Guide, . McCoy’s Guide to Adult Services in London and McCoy’s Guide to Adult . Services in East Anglia, the Midlands and Wales. Based on his McCoy’s scoring system, Chessington’s workers scored highest with an average of 4.5 stars. The working ladies of Surbiton . received an average 3.4 stars, those in Kingston were rated at three . stars, and New Malden’s working women were given 2.7 stars. He described nearby Croydon as boasting 'a number of working ladies, although none are of any note'. Not happy: Kit Malthouse, deputy Mayor of London with responsibility for policing, said he would ask the Metropolitan Police to investigate the legality of George McCoy's book . One former prostitute, listed in the . guide despite starting a new career, said she fell into the role through . friends, and had no regrets about a job she enjoyed. She said: 'I suppose [the book] is . handy if you are a guy who wants this kind of service. It’s good it has . people’s real opinions rather than what the people who do it themselves . say. It’s good to have an honest opinion.' The . Guide to the Agencies, Corrective Services and Parlours of London gives . a similar star rating to dominatrixes and 'masseurs'. Despite the police being asked to look at A Guide to the Working Ladies of London, it is unlikely that any prosecution would be brought against its author. The police may, however, be interested in offences connected with advertising on behalf of prostitutes. Such offences may include Conspiracy to Corrupt Public Morals or to Outrage Public Decency. But as author George McCoy is merely providing a guidebook and not working with or making money from the women he promotes, the police may have difficulties in bringing a charge. Even if the police passed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service, it would have to consider whether a prosecution would be in the public interest. British courts also take Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights - Freedom of Speech - very seriously. Free expression cannot be curtailed simply because a publication might offend. The question of whether a publication outrages public decency is one for a jury and the threshold for guilt is very high. Mr McCoy has four other guidebooks out concerning adult services and has never been prosecuted. That more than anything shows that a police charge against Mr McCoy is unlikely to happen.","Guide book lists contact details, specialisms, working hours and charging policies of almost 600 sex workers .

"Beachgoers using an historic American boardwalk in the prudish 1950s were breaking the law if they did not cover up. The problem for walkers in Asbury Park, New Jersey, however, is that the bathing suits ban was never repealed. Louise Murray, 74, a former city councilwoman, has told authorities to start enforcing the largely forgotten rule once again. Scroll down for video . Cover up: Beachgoers using Asbury Park Boardwalk (pictured) are breaking the law if they wear skimpy bathing suits . Ms Murray, who chairs the local Republican party, told CBS that when she was younger 'you could not go on that . boardwalk unless you had a cover-up and shoes'. A policeman would warn people not wearing shoes by blowing his whistle at them, she said. She has revealed that the law is still in force and offenders these days face a fine of up to $2,000 (£1,300), community service and even 90 days in jail. Ms Murray says she wants to restore the city's reputation for decency and modesty, which she claims is being ruined by the sight of skimpy swimsuits. She wants beachgoers to put on a shirt if they stroll along the boardwalk, which was built in 1880 and is mentioned in Bruce Springsteen's 1973 song '4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)'. Critic: Marjorie Conn (pictured) told Fox News the idea of enforcing the bathing suit ban was 'ridiculous' Boardwalk empire: Asbury Park lies within Monmouth County in New Jersey . She told CBS: 'We're going to end up like any other seedy boardwalk in some seashore town.' 'Do you really want to be sitting in a . restaurant and seeing somebody come up half-dressed? I never . walked in a bar in a bathing suit.' The 1958 Monmouth County decree, which has not been enforced for several years, reads: 'No person clad in bathing attire shall be on the boardwalk or the public sidewalks adjacent thereto.' But calls to enforce the rule again have been met with disbelief by many in the local community, including councilman Kevin Sanders, who views the law as 'archaic', CBS reported. He said enforcing it would create additional man hours. 'With . the state cutting back and the city cutting back, that raises taxes,' said Mr Sanders. 'So . I’m gonna have people riding around on bikes looking, checking . swimsuits? No.' City manager Terry Reidy said. 'We’re not going to start arresting them or throwing them off the boardwalk.' The Boss: Bruce Springsteen's 1973 song '4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)' mentions the boardwalk . Ban: Louise Murray says she wants to restore Asbury Park's reputation for decency and modesty, which she says is being ruined by the sight of skimpy swimsuits . Law is 'archaic': Councilman Kevin Sanders (pictured) said the decree would not be enforced . Marilyn Schlossback, a local business owner, told CBS: 'We're a community of free thinkers, of creative people, and to tell people to put on clothing at the beach just negates that.' And Marjorie Conn told Fox News: 'I totally disagree that people shouldn't be allowed to wear bathing suits on the boardwalk. 'That's ridiculous. It's a beach community. 'It's the stupidest thing I ever heard and it should be stricken from the books.' There are some, though, that do back Ms Murray's crusade. One man said: 'They shouldn't be out here all the time with bathing suits because it does not look good at all.' In the past there were changing rooms connected to the beach via catwalks and tunnels but since they went, people have had to use the boardwalk. Ms Murray may also have a bone to pick with Bruce Springsteen due to his seedy representation of the boardwalk and local people in '4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)'. 'The Boss' describes people in the song in an unflattering light including the 'stoned-out faces, switchblade lovers' and 'the greasers' who 'tramp the streets or get busted for sleeping out on the beach all night'. He sings that the 'wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark' and says he is tired of 'hangin' in them dusty arcades' and 'Chasin' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they promise to unsnap their jeans'. The way it was: In this old picture of Asbury Park Boardwalk, which was built in 1880, everybody is well covered up .","Decree from 1958 is still in force in Asbury Park, former city councilwoman Louise Murray, 74, reveals to shock of locals .

Wizz Air, the low cost airline that serves Eastern Europe, is said to have doubled the number of flights it is offering. Wizz Air denied that it had doubled the flights, saying that they had simply increased the number. However, because of the demand, even these no-frills flights are being sold at around £300 each. At the central bus station in Sofia, a large poster showing Big Ben, a London bus and traditional red phone box advertise the bus routes to a new life here. The poster reads: ‘Regular routes to London, Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg and Greece’ and offers a 5 per cent discount for booking  online with agent, Balkan Horn. All seats on two British Airways flights from Sofia to London Heathrow next Sunday and Monday – each carrying more than 152 passengers – have been sold. When controls imposed in 2005 are lifted tomorrow, 29million from the two countries will gain the right to work in Britain. While some of those coming here have expressed a desire to find ‘any job they can’, messages on internet forums show others making inquiries about benefits. One user of a popular website, who was already working in Britain, wrote: ‘My husband and I want to have a child in the UK. We want to know what kind of benefits we can apply for. We are interested in receiving a council house.’ A mother described how she is hoping to move her family to the UK in the hope of claiming child tax credits – while a man spoke of his desire to be given a house. A pregnant Romanian woman said: ‘I have read on this website I can get £190 a week from the British government from the 25th week of pregnancy. Could somebody help me with the documents?’ Others wrote of their hopes to give birth in a British hospital.

A pregnant woman wrote: ‘Can I give birth in the UK for free given that neither my husband nor I have the correct papers? Will we get British citizenship for our child?’ Aleksandra Dzhongova, who runs a legitimate employment agency in Sofia, said other firms had been set up with the specific intention of helping immigrants understand Britain’s welfare system, rather than filling job vacancies. One firm offered to help its Romanian clients avoid paying fines issued by HM Revenue & Customs. A source at a firm helping Romanians find work in Britain told the Mail: ‘There are already many using these social benefits without necessarily having an urgent need for them. 'I hope Romanians in the UK do not tell those from home that they are entitled to claim benefits because everyone will try to claim. ‘If you ask Romanians why are they claiming benefits they say, “If it is allowed by the law, then why not?” They have seen the Brits claiming and other nationalities too, so they want to join the queue.’ Wizz Air, the low cost airline that serves Eastern Europe, has increased the number of flights it is offering . While some of those coming here have expressed a desire to find 'any job they can', messages on internet forums show others making inquiries about benefits . The Daily Mail asked Priority Point, which gives Romanian migrants advice on settling in the UK, whether they could help a Romanian woman with two children with no legal documents to claim benefits while looking for a job as a housekeeper. A member of staff said they could, for a free. The employee said: ‘There is no problem. But first she will need to apply for a national insurance number and then she can apply to receive money for the kids.’ When asked if the company will fill out the paper work, the employee replied: ‘Yes, we will do. For the documents for claiming child benefits you’ll be charged £70.’ Travel agencies in Sofia as well as the Romanian capital of Bucharest reported huge demand for tickets. At the Central Bus Station in Sofia, travel agent Svetlanka Beaucheva said: ‘Everything is booked until Thursday, January 9. There are no seats left.’ Sixteen coaches carrying more than 50 passengers each will make the 1,500-mile journey by road to London from Sofia next month. A manager at coach company Karats Eurolines said prices had gone up due to the high demand.Another, at coach firm Balkan Horn, said: ‘It is very busy, many people want to travel to England, especially with the change in EU rules. But everything is booked up, it’s hard to get there.’ Ion Prioteasa, president of Dolj county in the south of Romania, claimed that the numbers travelling from there to all destinations will double to 70,000 next year.

"A new and annoying species of ant is terrorizing the U.S. and chemicals that kill off other types of the insect are proving ineffective against it. The 'crazy' ant, named for the erratic trail it leaves as it makes its way across the country, originated in Argentina and Brazil. But since it was first spotted in Houston in 2002, it has spread to some 21 counties in Texas, 20 counties in Florida and a few locations in Mississippi and Louisiana. Scroll down for video . The biggest factor to the spread of 'crazy' ants has been transportation via humans . Courtesy: University of Texas College of Natural Sciences . University of Texas researcher and co-author of a study on the creatures Ed LeBrun said the omnivorous ants attack and kill other species as well as monopolizing food sources to the detriment of the entire ecosystem. He said everything from cattle to songbirds are at risk of the tiny ants, despite them being at the bottom of the food chain. According to ABC News, the chemicals that kill the more common red ant aren't effective on crazy ants so residents should call pest control if they find an infestation in their home. And hopefully they'll get there before the critters attack their computer. The insects, bizarrely, are attracted to electrical wiring and components and in one year alone caused $146.5 million in damages in Texas, ABC reported. The devastation occurs when one ant discovers the transformer then gets electrocuted when it touches it, and 'waves its abdomen in the air' omitting a certain scent. The scent lures for ants to the scene and they too are electrocuted, again sending the scent into the air to attract their friends. Eventually, there are so many dead ants that the electric switches get stuck or the insulation fries and the system shuts down. Terrors: University of Texas researcher Ed LeBrun said the omnivorous ant, pictured, attacks and kills other species as well as monopolising food sources to the detriment of the entire ecosystem . But LeBrun said the biggest problem of the ant's invasion is that it has completely eliminated the red ant, or fire ant. And no one knows why. 'Perhaps the biggest deal is the displacement of the fire ant,' LeBrun said, according to ABC. 'The whole ecosystem has changed around fire ants. Things that can't tolerate fire ants are gone. Many that can have flourished. 'New things have come in. Now we are going to go through and whack the fire ants and put something in its place that has a very different biology. There are going to be a lot of changes that come from that.' The crazy ants are most commonly found in coastal areas with warmer temperatures. Known scientifically as 'Nylanderia fulva,' they are also referred to as 'rasberry' after the exterminator Tom Rasberry who discovered them in Houston in 2002. The 'crazy' ants do not have such a painful sting as their insect counterparts, but they are still a nuisance for homeowners. 'Crazy' ants have been identified all the way from Texas to Mississippi. Researchers believe that the ants cannot survive in regions that are dry or cold. Unlike fire ants, crazy ants also do not spread as quickly. They can only advance approximately 200 meters per year on their own. The biggest factor in their spread along the Southeast has been human transportation. LeBrun urges caution for residents in areas with known 'crazy' ant populations to be mindful when they are traveling.","Since it was first spotted in Houston in .

"Russian investigators claim to have found household appliances imported from China which contain hidden microchips that pump spam data and malware into wi-fi networks. Authorities in St Petersburg allegedly discovered 20 to 30 kettles and irons with 'spy microchips that send some data to the foreign server', according to Russian media. The revelation comes just as the EU launches an investigation into claims that Russia itself bugged gifts to delegates at last month's G20 summit in an attempt to retrieve data from computers and telephones. Kitchen espionage: Kettles imported to Russia from China with hidden microchips which can send spam data and possibly steal information have allegedly been found by authorities in St Petersburg . This has led to speculation that the . chips allegedly found in the home appliances may also have the ability . to steal data and send it back to Chinese servers. The allegations against the Chinese were made in St Petersburg news outlet Rosbalt, which quotes a source from customs broker Panimport, but does not detail what data was being sent or to where. According to The Register, which translated the article, it would be possible to build a malicious microchip - sometimes referred to as a spambot or spybot - small enough to hide in a kettle. It also believes there are many readily available transformers which could be used to convert Russia's 220V electricty supply to power the chips without destroying them. But it casts doubt on the report's claims that the devices were discovered because they were overweight as it is unlikely that the difference of a few grams would have been enough to raise suspicion. This might only have happened if the appliances were air-freighted, it said, which was probably not the case because they were cheap items. Cyber wars: The revelation comes as the EU launches a probe into claims that Russia bugged gifts to delegates such as British Prime Minster David Cameorn (centre) at last month's G20 summit in a bid to steal data . It emerged yesterday that the European Union is investigating . gifts that visiting delegations received at last month's summit in St .

Commission spokesman Frederic Vincent said that experts were . looking into the handouts, which included USB sticks and were given out . at the Group of 20 summit, but said 'analysis of hardware and software . have not amounted to any serious security concerns.' He added the . investigation had not yet been fully completed.

"Mohammed Suleman Khan built a house the size of Buckingham Palace by dodging taxes but has now been jailed . A fraudster who cheated British taxpayers out of £450,000 built a mansion the size of  Buckingham Palace in Pakistan, complete with a library and private cinema. Mohammed Suleman Khan, 42, aroused suspicion among his neighbours as he lived in a large gated house and drove a flashy BMW, yet hung around in tracksuits and appeared to be unemployed. When detectives raided his £500,000 home in Birmingham they were astonished to learn that this was far from the full extent of his dishonestly acquired wealth. It emerged that he had also secretly built the ‘enormous’ £2.3million mansion in northern Pakistan, when police came across the architect’s plans. Khan was jailed for four years last week after pleading guilty to defrauding the British tax authorities out of nearly £450,000 over nine years. Police struggled to create a detailed picture of his finances, as he was careful to use cash wherever possible and possessed few assets. Relatives owned his family home in the Moseley area of Birmingham, and only small amounts of money passed through his bank accounts. He claimed that he earned no more than £40,000 a year from a job as a debt collector, and other business interests. But detectives found no evidence that he was a legitimate debt collector, and calculated his income must have been at least £1million over the nine-year period to fund his lavish lifestyle in the UK alone. They also discovered he had handled huge amounts of bank notes – as much as £120,000 on one occasion – and had paid for expensive cars in cash, spending £22,000 on a black BMW. The true scale of Khan’s fraud emerged when police found the plans for his luxury ‘palace’ on the outskirts of Ghorghushti, a town in northern Pakistan with strong links to Birmingham.. As the British police had no jurisdiction to investigate in Pakistan, they were forced to use satellite photographs from Google Earth to estimate its value. Experts put the full cost of construction at £2.3million, although detectives were never able to see inside the mansion, described as ‘the size of Buckingham Palace’. The investigation found Khan had pocketed £1.19million over nine years, and failed to pay HM Revenue and Customs more than £445,000 in tax and National Insurance. He pleaded guilty to cheating the public revenue in November, and last week was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court. The property built by frauster Khan in Pakistan (left) was as big as London's Buckingham Palace (right) Passing sentence, Judge Andrew Menary QC pointed to the mansion in Pakistan as the most obvious evidence that Khan was living beyond legitimate means. He said: ‘It is enormous ... with dozens of rooms, a library, servant quarter, cinema, underground parking and guard rooms. It is the size of Buckingham Palace.’ West Midlands Police said Khan was seen as ‘untouchable’ by some members of his community, but had been brought to justice thanks to its officers’ painstaking work. Detective Inspector Andy Bannister added: ‘The nature of Khan’s offending meant that this was a particularly complex investigation in which detectives had to piece together information from a range of sources – including satellite imaging data on the property – to secure charges. 'Khan’s bank accounts bore no resemblance to his day-to-day-living. ‘He maintained he was a debt collector and businessman but failed to provide investigators or the court with any evidence to back this up.’ Khan was living in a gated house in Grove Avenue, Birmingham while he scammed the taxman .","Neighbours raised suspicions over Birmingham's Mohammed Suleman Khan .

"More men fake it than you might think, with 10 admitting they have deceived their partner in bed . Today may be National Orgasm Day but instead of jumping under the duvet and indulging in some unbridled passion, a large number of Brits will be feeling more 'uh oh' than the big O between the sheets tonight. Despite the recent resurgence of sexual liberty thanks to the erotic novel Fifty Shades Of Grey, among other things, it seems that pleasure is staying firmly on the page when it comes to women’s sex lives, with 58 per cent of women admitting to faking an orgasm at least once during their relationship. And out of the women who admit faking it between the sheets, a whopping 93 per cent said they had faked it more than once. It is not just the ladies who are feigning pleasure during sex either, as 10 per of men admit to faking an orgasm 'regularly' too. The main reason men admit to pretending to climax is to ‘avoid hurting their partner’s feelings’ (40 per cent) or they’re simply ‘too tired’ (35 per cent) to fully let go. Interestingly it seems that men are more open to the idea of feigning their climax than women. More men (72 per cent) who have never feigned a climax would consider doing it in the future, compared to 63 per cent of women who have never faked it. Women, it would seem, are generally none the wiser to their partner's devious ways with only 16 per cent ever having suspected that their other half was faking it, despite 50 per cent of men in a relationship and 35 per cent of married men admitting they faking orgasm regularly . In contrast men, perhaps justifiably, have suspicious minds when it comes to their partner between the sheets, with over 58 per cent of men reporting they suspect that their partner has put on act in bed. Unsurprisingly, more men rate their sex drive as 'high' than women . The survey, conducted by Ann Summers, also found a distinct divide between the North and the South of the UK with the south reporting a much higher rate of faking than their northern equivalents. Women who live in Northern Ireland (6 per cent), Yorkshire (6 per cent) and the North East (5 per cent) are less likely to fake an orgasm than their southern counterparts, as the survey revealed that women from South East (18 per cent) and South West (10 per cent) are the biggest fakers. And the geographic difference also applies to men with males from the South East (17 per cent) are also most likely to fake it compared to Welsh men (8 per cent) and those who reside in the North East (2 per cent). But not all is lost – when it comes to having the most orgasms – single men have it the best, with only 14 per cent admitting to faking it compared to 50 per cent of partnered-up men. More women orgasm alone than men, getting slightly fewer big-Os from their partner than  men . For women though, married life equals more orgasms. Only 12 per cent pretend in bed compared to 59 per cent of those in a relationship and 28 per cent of singletons. Although many women are left high and dry between the sheets, over 40 per cent of men would feel concerned about their other half if they faked it and said they would ‘talk it through with their partner to find out what the real problem is’ if they caught their other half putting on an act. However, if you are ever tempted to fake the big O – screaming the bedroom door down is the biggest giveaway (52 per cent) followed by making loud noises (37 per cent) and crying (24 per cent). Orgasm frequency . Forget love and companionship, for . one in six men a relationship is dependent on performance between the . sheets - and they would leave a partner who failed to satisfy them in . bed. Hitting the spot . is so important to one in four men and one in five women that they rate . having regular orgasms more highly than being in love. But . despite how important their sex lives are to their relationships, less . than half of Britons admitted they were 'very happy' with how often they . orgasm in a recent survey conducted by online retailer bondara.co.uk. It's over: 39 per cent of Brits said failing to reach an orgasm with their partner would be a contributory factor in a break-up . They quizzed 3800 British men . and women and found that 16 per cent of men and 10 per cent of women . would end a loving relationship if they failed to reach an orgasm with their partner, with a further 39 per cent of men and women stating it would be a contributory factor. Although . 60 per cent said they were 'very happy' when asked to rate their . relationship in general, this figure fell by 17 per cent for men and 6 . per cent for women when asked to rate the sexual side of their . relationship. When asked what affected their ability to reach orgasm, tiredness was the most common cause . with 20 per cent of women and 23 per cent of men. Self-esteem . issues ranked second for women followed by 'lack of sexual . desire'. For 15 per cent of men, hitting the booze caused a problem in the . bedroom as being drunk prevented them from climaxing, while job worries affect 12 per cent of men. Relax: Sex expert Joanna Coker said couples should have more fun and not get hung up on achieving the 'big O' One in four of those surveyed stated they felt under pressure to reach orgasm every time they have sex. As a result 27 per cent of men and 69 per cent of women have at some point faked an orgasm. Joanna Coker, sex expert for Bondara.co.uk, said couples should try not to get so 'hung up' on achieving an orgasm. She said: 'While having an orgasm is a wonderful part of sex, making love can still be enjoyable without the big 'O'. 'Try . not to get too hung up on it as this will only make the situation . worse. The ability to have an orgasm is affected by many factors as this . survey shows, to be at your sexual peak keep healthy, try not to get . overtired and avoid too much alcohol.' Ms . Coker added that the old adage of 'never going to bed on an argument' is true if you want a fulfilling sex life and couples shouldn't be . afraid to talk to one another about issues between the sheets. 'Misunderstandings . and conflicts can all affect your sexual life; it is hard to feel . carefree and orgasm when you are conflicted or angry with your partner. If you're having difficulties talk about them and try to resolve them, . leaving you freer to relax and enjoy your sex life,' she said. Bondara conducted their research to mark next week's 'National Orgasm Day' and asked respondents worked for them in the bedroom. For 47 per cent of women, spending more time on foreplay made a difference as well as more oral sex (38 per cent) and introducing sex toys (35 per cent). For . men, more oral sex (54 per cent) was a must, followed by spending more . time on foreplay (43 per cent), introducing sex toys (42 per cent) and . changing sexual positions (38 per cent). A separate survey by Ann Summers revealed how the sex lives of Brits varies around the country. They . found that men from the South East, aged between 25-34, who are in a . relationship and have sex several times a week, fake an orgasm more . regularly than sexually active, male singletons. Men from the South East (17 per cent) are also most likely to fake it compared . to Welsh men (8 per cent) and those who reside in the North East (2 per cent). Meanwhile, women who live in Northern Ireland (6 per cent), Yorkshire (6 per cent) and the North . East (5 per cent) are less likely to fake an orgasm than their southern . counterparts, as the survey revealed that women from South East (18 per cent) and South West (10 per cent) are the biggest fakers.

"Clinical trials of 'quack' alternative medicines should be stopped because they are damaging and financially wasteful, two leading critics have said. U.S. scientists, professor of surgery and oncology at Wayne State University, David Gorski, and Steven Novella, an assistant professor in neurology at Yale School of Medicine, launched a scathing attack of treatments including aromatherapy, homeopathy and reiki. They condemned scientists who continue to carry out controlled experiments to discover whether the 'highly implausible treatments' work. The pair brand homeopathy and reilki as 'faith healing', claiming clinical trials of the treatments have 'already been proved to have no benefits whatsoever', and 'merely lend them legitimacy and take money away from more deserving projects'. U.S. scientists, professor of surgery and oncology at Wayne State University, David Gorski, and Steven Novella, an assistant professor in neurology at Yale School of Medicine, have launched a scathing attack of treatments including aromatherapy, pictured, homeopathy and reiki, branding them 'quack treatments' The article comes just weeks after Conservative MP David Tredinnick praised the fact herbal remedies and healing were now becoming accepted in parts of the NHS, and called for astrology to be incorporated into the health service. Professor Gorski said: 'We hope this will be the first of many opportunities to discuss in the peer-reviewed literature the perils and pitfalls of doing clinical trials on treatment modalities that have already been refuted by basic science. 'The two key examples in the article, homeopathy and reiki, are about as close to impossible from basic science considerations alone as you can imagine. 'Homeopathy involves diluting substances away to nothing and beyond, while reiki is in essence faith healing that substitutes Eastern mysticism for Christian beliefs, as can be demonstrated by substituting the word ‘god’ for the ‘universal source’ that reiki masters claim to be able to tap into to channel their ‘healing energy’ into patients.' Professor Novella argued clinical trials of such treatments would not change the minds of those who already practice them, but might make people who are tempted to try them believe they might actually work. He said: 'Studying highly implausible treatments is a losing proposition. 'Such studies are unlikely to demonstrate benefit, and proponents are unlikely to stop using the treatment when the study is negative. The U.S. critics, who claim reiki, pictured, is 'faith healing', said clinical trials into alternative medicine are 'damaging and a waste of money, diverting money from other projects' 'Such research only serves to lend legitimacy to otherwise dubious practices.' The professors, who run a blog about integrating science and medicine, have called for changes in the medical system to ensure doctors have the time to truly treat patients 'holistically' by listening to them and taking account of their circumstances before prescribing them medicine. They argue this course will bring far more success than doctors offering patients treatments that claim to heal the body and mind but really have no success. Professor Gorski added: 'Somehow this idea has sprung up that to be a ‘holistic’ doctor you have to embrace pseudoscience like homeopathy, reiki, traditional Chinese medicine, and the like, but that’s a false dichotomy. 'If the medical system is currently too impersonal and patients are rushed through office visits because a doctor has to see more and more patients to cover his salary and expenses, then the answer is to find a way to fix those problems, not to embrace quackery. 'Integrating pseudoscience with science-based medicine isn’t going to make science-based medicine better. 'One of our bloggers, Mark Crislip, has a fantastic saying for this: ""If you mix cow pie with apple pie, it does not make the cow pie taste better; it makes the apple pie worse"". Professor Novella, said: 'Such research only serves to lend legitimacy to otherwise dubious practices.' File picture of homeopathic medicine . 'With CAM or ""integrative medicine"", that’s exactly what we’re doing, and these clinical trials of magic are just more examples of it.' Professors Gorski and Novella have also called on patients to use their own common sense when looking at the evidence to decide for themselves whether a treatment actually works or not. Professor Gorski added: 'Critical thinking will help patients learn to recognize when a course of treatment is not supported by data or to tell when a health claim from any practitioner is just too good to be true.' The article was published in the journal Trends in Molecular Medicine. A spokeswoman for the Reiki Council, said: 'There is a growing grassroots demand for therapies such as reiki as people report significant improvements in their well-being. 'This is backed up by a research database that, despite the lack of funding, is beginning to suggest benefits particularly in the arena of stress, depression and anxiety. Increasing numbers of hospitals and hospice offer reiki for their patients - a snowballing effect due to patient demand and medical professionals observations.' The MailOnline has also approached The Society of Homeopaths and the Aromatherapy Council for comment.","Professor David Gorski of Wayne State University and Steven Novella from Yale School of Medicine launched a scathing attack on alternative medicines .

"The doctor performing a biopsy on Joan Rivers’ vocal cords stopped to take a selfie in the procedure room while the comedian was under anesthesia and just moments before she went into cardiac arrest, a shocking new report claims. The physician hasn't been publicly identified, but is believed to be Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat doctor. A member of staff at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators about the physician's questionable behavior, a source close to the death investigation told CNN. Scroll down for video . The doctor performing a biopsy on Joan Rivers’ vocal cords allegedly stopped to take a selfie in the procedure room just moments before the comedian went into cardiac arrest on August 28 . Rivers, 81, had checked in for a routine throat procedure at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic in Manhattan on August 28, when her condition took a shocking turn for the worse. First the clinic's medical director Dr. Lawrence Cohen carried out a scheduled endoscopy. The procedure was intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat and it involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. After Cohen had finished his work, a biopsy was allegedly done on Rivers without her prior consent. Clinic: Rivers was at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, which made the initial 911 call after she went into cardiac arrest . Dr. Lawrence Cohen, medical director at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic in Manhattan resigned in the wake of the celebrity's death . 9:40 a.m, August 27: Yorkville Clinic called 911 with reports of a cardiac arrest. 9:45 a.m: The New York Fire Department response team arrives to find CPR underway, and takes over. 9:47 am: An ambulance from Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, arrives and joins in. 9.48am: A second NYFD unit with Emergency Medical Technicians, along with a supervisor, arrive at the clinic. 9:50 am: By this point the number of rescuers totals ten people. ‘Even though you are a licensed physician, you still should have, if you will, the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place,’ Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University's Langone Medical Center, told CNN. Investigators believe that Rivers' vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29. Rivers was then taken from the clinic to Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she died a week later. On Thursday Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement denying that any vocal cord biopsy had been carried out at the clinic. The next day, Dr. Cohen resigned in the wake of the celebrity's death. Neither Cohen nor Rivers' ear, nose and throat specialist have been accused of wrongdoing at this stage by investigators. After several days on life support, Rivers died on September 4 prompting an outpouring of grief from the world of showbusiness. Details of how emergency services responded to the star's unexpected cardiac arrest at a clinic in New York were released last week. Two weeks after the incident, a New York city official revealed exactly how the different emergency services fought to save her, and that she was surrounded by rescuers within ten minutes. The official told CNN that the response began with a 911 call from the clinic, which was given the highest priority. The fire department were first to arrive at the clinic, five minutes after the call. Medical staff were already trying to give Rivers CPR using a defibrillator and a breathing tube. The firefighters then took over the attempts to revive her. Two minutes after the firefighters came, an ambulance arrived at the clinic, whose paramedics helped with the CPR. Almost immediately after that, another Fire Department vehicle arrived with medical aid, making a total of more than 10 people fighting to save her.","Doctor performing a biopsy on Joan Rivers' vocal cords stopped to take a selfie while the comedian was under anesthesia, a report claims .

"He is his great rival in the battle to prove who is best at running the economy and the country. But Ed Balls has challenged George Osborne to join him in running the London Marathon. Labour's shadow chancellor threw down the gauntlet to the top Tory after discovering they were both following the 5:2 diet fad. Running mates: Ed Balls has run the London Marathon twice before, but wants George Osborne to join him this year . Mr Balls has twice completed the grueling 26-mile run through the capital. In 2012 he finished in 5 hours and 31 minutes, insisting he would never do it again. 'The euphoria only lasted so long before the pain really set in,' he said. But he donned his trainers again last year, shaving 17 minutes off his time and raising £100,000 for charity. Now he has issued the invitation to his great political foe to join him in this year's race. 'Mr Balls told The Sun: 'George Osborne sponsored my last two marathons for Action for Stammering Children and Whizz-Kidz.. Now he's trying to get in shape, maybe he'll join me this year.' Labour aides said they are yet to receive a response to the invitation from Mr Osborne, who is in Sydney for a meeting of the G20. The challenge came after the Mail revealed Mr Osborne was following the 5:2 diet, which means he has to fast twice a week. Mr Balls has previously been a devotee of the weight-loss plan. Mr Osborne imposed austerity measures on his food intake as part of an . image makeover, which aides hope will boost his chances of succeeding . David Cameron. The Chancellor has also been pictured sweating and exhausted running around St James’s Park, across the road from the Treasury. The Chancellor has already abandoned his foppish former haircut in favour of a close cropped Caesar cut, which his allies believe looks more serious. A Government source said: ‘George is on the 5-2 diet. Given the job he’s doing turning around the health of the economy, it’s unsurprising that he’s keeping himself in shape as well.’ Ahead of last year's spending review Mr Osborne tweeted this picture of himself tucking into an upmarket Byron burger . The diet requires Mr Osborne to limit his intake to 600 calories two days a week and eat normally on the other five. That . would allow him to continue enjoying occasional indulgences like the . Byron burger he was pictured with at the time of the Budget last year. On that occasion, Mr Osborne tweeted a picture of his dinner from the upmarket chain as he was preparing his big speech. A ""Classic"" Byron 6oz hamburger with . lettuce, tomato, red onion and mayonnaise costs £6.75 with fries an . extra £2.95. If cheese is added, the price of the burger rises to £7.95. Mr . Osborne’s quest to get into shape first became apparent last year when . he was spotted wearing a computerised wristband called the Jawbone Up, . which monitors the amount of exercise he takes and the quality of his . sleep. He has not been slow to taunt Eric Pickles, the corpulent Communities Secretary, repeatedly telling gags about his weight in speeches at Tory Party conference. Mr Pickles once hit back, tweeting an image of himself eating a salad. Treasury officials declined to discuss how the Chancellor is coping with the diet or what foods he is surviving on during fast days.","Labour's shadow chancellor throws down the gauntlet to political rival .

"The Obama administration quietly announced on Tuesday that it intends to change the way Americans learn about natural disasters and other major emergencies during radio and TV broadcasts, giving the president the ability to flip a switch and address the entire nation at once. The Emergency Alert System, the latest version of a program first established in 1951, blasts out  emergency messages in the event of local weather emergencies, but can also be used to warn Americans about terror attacks and major natural disasters. Every broadcaster in the country is required to participate in the EAS. Messages travel along a closed, private network, piggybacking  from station to station. It can take up to 10 minutes for every radio, TV, cable and satellite provider to blare its alert. Television screens display text messages during Emergency Alert System events, and could be used by future White Houses for a variety of purposes . Most messages in the system are restricted to specific states, counties or other geographic areas. But now the Federal Communications Commission has filed public notice of a rule change that would bypass the daisy-chain entirely and give the federal government instant access to all the nation's airwaves at once, in the event of a national emergency. Some Republicans fear a system that would give the White House a way to address the entire country at will could be abused. 'Oh, great,' a Republican Capitol Hill staffer told MailOnline on Tuesday. 'Big Brother is talking to you.' 'Call me crazy, but I have a feeling we're going to see the definition of an ""emergency"" get looser and looser – especially as we get closer to an election.' The FCC's plan could also make the national EAS vulnerable to the sort of hacking that embarrassed broadcasters in Montana a year ago. In July 2013 hackers there gained access to an EAS signal and broadcast a phony alert about a zombie apocalypse on a string of CBS television affiliates owned by the Montana Television Network. 'Civil authorities in your area have reported that the bodies of the dead are rising from their graves and attacking the living,' the fictitious message said. 'Follow the messages onscreen that will be updated as information becomes available. Do not attempt to approach or apprehend these bodies as they are considered extremely dangerous.' At least one radio station in Michigan also fell prey to the hack. Instant access: Barack Obama and future U.S. presidents will have the ability to flip a switch and address the entire nation at will . The congressional aide also said that with more and more Americans going online for information, social media is already replacing broadcast emergency messages as the best way to spread urgent news. 'If we have another 9/11, the people who hear about it through an EAS message are going to be the last to know,' he said. 'By the time you hear that annoying ""buzz"" sound on the radio, all your friends will have tweeted about it. But according to a notice published Tuesday in the Federal Register, the government continues to rely on EAS as its primary means of alerting Americans about emergencies in real time. The Hill reported that the FCC believes the new system will help with 'saving human lives, reducing injuries, mitigating property damage, and minimizing the disruption of the national economy.' Most messages sent through the EAS are periodic tests designed to condition Americans to what a real alert would look and sound like. The government has tested the system on a national basis just once, in November 2011. The FCC also has a separate public alert system for smartphones in the works. It was first tested in 2013 on a statewide basis but hasn't been fully deployed.","White House wants to be able to instantly talk to the entire country in the event of a terror attack of major natural disaster .

"UK warships are to benefit from an unmanned 'eye in the sky' as part of a new multimillion-pound contract. The unarmed ScanEagle aircraft is to be used by the Royal Navy and will launch from the back of ships to fly above them. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has announced it will use the craft to collect intelligence and scout out the surrounding areas. The Ministry of Defence has announced plans to use an unarmed, unmanned aircraft called ScanEagle, pictured. It can be launched from the back of Naval ships and fly above them collecting data and surveying the surrounding areas . ScanEagle has a built-in electro-optical and infrared camera with communications range over 62 miles. The craft can fly for more than 20 hours. ScanEagle has a 3.1 metre wingspan and is 1.4metres long. It weights 44 pounds (20 kg) and can travel at a maximum speed of 80 knots, with an average cruising speed of around 50 to 60 knots. The pneumatic launcher is known as the 'SuperWedge' launcher. It is recovered using the 'Skyhook' retrieval system, which uses a hook on the end of the wingtip to catch a rope hanging from a pole. It does this by using GPS units mounted on the top of the pole and UAV. Each ScanEagle system comes with four air vehicles, a ground control station, remote video terminal, and the Skyhook launch and recovery system. With a wingspan of just over three metres and weighing 22kg, the 'eye in the sky' will be launched from Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships by a pneumatic catapult. It will then will fly at around 60 knots - although can reach speeds of up to 80 knots - for more than 20 hours. It is commanded by a specialist team on board the ship. This team plan its missions then control its flights, analysing the information it gathers using state-of-the-art sensors, before bringing it back to the ship. Built by Insitu, a subsidiary of Boeing Defence UK Limited, the ScanEagle is being introduced as part of a £30 million contract signed by the MoD. It has been used by other nations but is the first 'maritime-specific unmanned air system capability' being used in support of naval operations, said the MoD. ScanEagle will add to current intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance methods such as helicopters and long-range radar. Royal . Navy Captain Ian Annett, said: 'ScanEagle represents an important . addition to the Royal Navy's intelligence, surveillance and . reconnaissance capability. 'Its . ability to deploy during the day and night coupled with the technology . it uses, will give commanders a clearer picture of the operational . situation whenever it's required.' The ScanEagle can be launched from ships using a pneumatic catapult, pictured. It will then fly at around 60 knots above the vessel commanded by a specialist team onboard the ship . With a wingspan of just over three metres and weighing 22kg, the ScanEagle 'eye in the sky' will be launched from Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships. It gathers data using built-in sensors and then takes this information back to the ship . Minister for defence, equipment, support and technology, Philip Dunne, added: 'ScanEagle provides the Royal Navy with proven surveillance capability that has already been used on operations by other nations, so we know we are getting top quality equipment. 'The technology is off-the-shelf and will be available to the Royal Navy as soon as possible. 'Our continued investment in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems is essential to keeping our armed forces up to date with the latest capabilities and this will be a central part of the MoD's investment in new equipment over the next 10 years.'

"He has become as well known for his acid-tongued outbursts as for his historical insights. But yesterday David Starkey faced . calls to be dropped as a BBC panellist after his latest outrageous . appearance on Question Time. The broadcaster and Tudor expert said .

His comments prompted a backlash from viewers, who branded his performance ‘rude’, ‘intolerant’ and ‘offensive’. The academic has previously been . accused of racism after describing Scotland, Wales and Ireland as . ‘feeble little countries’ on the BBC1 panel programme, and blaming . ‘black culture’ for the riots that swept the country last August. Allied troops wading ashore from landing craft during the Normandy . landings in 1944. Dr Starkey said Britain and America adding: 'What . thanks did we get?' Bombardment: The embattled Homs suburb of Baba Amr has fallen to government troops, ending a bloody, month-long siege during which hundreds of people are thought to have been killed . Anglo-French relations began to sour after France's surrender to the Nazis. The French felt bitterness towards the . British for evacuating Dunkirk after being cut off by the German army - . in a move even Churchill described as a 'colossal military disaster'. Meanwhile, Britain was understandably frustrated by France's decision to collaborate with the enemy. Within two weeks of the armistice signing, the British had shelled the French fleet, fearing it could fall into German hands. This onslaught, at Mers-el-Kébir, on the coast of what was then French Algeria, left 1,297 French sailors dead and 350 wounded. Over the next four years, four more Vichy French colonies were hit - with around 10,000 Frenchmen killed or injured. The turning point came on August 24, 1944, with an uprising of the French Resistance against the German garrison in Paris. Shortly after, the US Third Army under General Patton entered the fray. And when the Americans entered Paris, they were warmly greeted. But the sheer number of US troops took its toll on the city's infrastructure - and tensions grew between the liberated and the liberators. With the Allied rescue came France's search for a national identity - and a return to its dignity. In his appearance on Question Time . this week, Dr Starkey, 67, said the West should not  intervene in Syria . because nations should free themselves from oppression. He said: ‘Humanitarian intervention is almost always disastrous. Let me give you an example, it’s called France. ‘You will remember Britain and . America liberated France. What thanks did we get from them? The French . have spent the last 40 years trying to obliterate the shame by doing . everything they can to damage Britain and America.’ He went on: ‘People don’t like being freed, they mistake liberators for conquerors.’ Shocked host David Dimbleby asked if he was suggesting Britain and the Allies should not have acted to save France in 1944. Dr Starkey replied: ‘No, I’m not . David. We didn’t go into France to liberate France, we went into France . to destroy Nazi Germany.’ He also accused his fellow panellist . Rachel Reeves, Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, of ‘cheap . posturing’ and branded Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson ‘pompous’. When an audience member dared to . accuse him of ‘propaganda’, he turned on him, saying: ‘Why do you have . the insolence to think that your opinion is better than anybody else’s?’ Dr Starkey also attacked Conservative MP John Redwood, calling him ‘completely inhuman’. David Starkey made his comments to an audience at Dewsbury Town Hall on Thursday night's Question Time when the panel were discussing whether it would be right to intervene in Syria . To give his remarks some historical context, the German military machine had defeated the French by mid-1940. An armistice, signed in June, saw Paris governed by the Nazis - and the establishment of Vichy France - a government in thrall to their conquerors. Many in the Question Time audience no doubt wondered what military strategy 'Field Marshal' Starkey would have offered as an alternative to the Allied liberation. Fortunately, Churchill and Roosevelt had made up their minds - which saw American troops entering Paris in 1944, and Germany's retreat. Dr Starkey says 'We didn't have humanitarian intervention to save Louis XVI (left) and said Britain has this 'weird notion, exemplified by the divinely ordained Tony Blair that you go and give people freedom' Last stand: A lone resistance fighter in the embattled neighbourhood of Baba Amr hours before government troops stormed the district yesterday .

"They provide one of the great intrigues of the human race. For centuries scientists and psychologists have attempted to unravel the mysteries of twins and how siblings who share almost identical genetic make-ups can often be so different. Now a landmark project by National Geographic - using both photography and science - has attempted to shed some light on our fascination with twins. Beautiful image: Six-year-olds Johanna and Eva Gill are just two of many subjects photographed for a National Geographic feature on the differences and similarities between twins . Scientists are intrigued by twins as they share an almost-identical genetic code, leaving . differences between them down to environmental factors such as how many . hours of sun they get.

Schoeller, of New York, took the charming photo of the Gill girls, who . both have mild autism, in which Johanna is seen putting a protective . hand on Eva. ‘It's . very clear when you look at twins that much of what they share is . hardwired,’ researcher Danielle Reed told National Geographic. ‘Many . things about them are absolutely the same. ‘But it's also clear, when you get to know them, that other things about them are different.’ Stars: The tennis duo Mike and Bob Bryan have won more than 70 championships between them, including a title at the Wimbledon Championships in London earlier this year . Another set of twins featured in the National Geographic study are Don and Dave Wolf, of Fenton, Michigan, who have been truck-driving partners for 18 years. ‘We're . wired the same,’ Don Wolf, 53, said. ‘He's messier than I am. But we . like the same music and share the same sense of humour.’ The brothers have driven more than three million miles together. 'We're . wired the same. He's messier than I am. But we . like the same music and share the same sense of humour' Don Wolf on Dave Wolf . The National Geographic study is the latest scientific exploration into the world of twins. One of the most famous studies was the 'Minnesota Twin Family Study' led by David Lykken, which . looked at 65 pairs of twins separated in infancy from the 1970s. It . showed that almost every psychological trait is mostly down to . genetics. But as long ago as 1875, British scientist Sir Francis Galton . had made a similar observation. A whole century on, University of Minnesota psychologist Thomas Bouchard Jr performed a study on twins' intelligence beginning in the 1970s that ruffled many feathers in the scientific community. It helped him conclude that IQ differences are largely down to inheritance - not education. This was a controversial view as experts had said for decades that intelligence was taught and not hereditary. On the road: Don and Dave Wolf, of Fenton, Michigan, have been truck-driving partners for 18 years and driven more than three million miles together . Other examples of twins that have captured the public's attention include Jennifer and . June Gibbons. The troubled teenage Gibbons twins became known for their 11-year sentences at Broadmoor . psychiatric hospital in Berkshire, England, for arson. Jennifer died . aged 30 in 1993. Twins are born with an almost-identical genetic code, but can still have surprising physical or psychological differences that mean they lead wildly different lives. For example, one can be left-handed and the other right - as in the Bryan champion tennis brothers. Or one can adapt better to unusual social situations than the other. But many decide to lead similar lives and even make something of the fact they are twins to help propel them to stardom - such as actors Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Scientists say twins often develop much closer bonds than fraternal brothers and sisters, which was shown by the notorious delinquent Gibbons twins' secret language. But it . was before their psychiatric sentence that they were most interesting to . psychologists, as they developed a secret language and communication system, which appeared to be almost telepathic. Another example emerged 10 years ago when almost 3,000 people were killed in . the attacks on 9/11 - and 46 of them were twins. Greg Hoffman thought . about committing suicide after losing his twin brother Stephen in the . New York attack. New York City firefighter Zachary Fletcher, 47, arrived at the World Trade Center scene shortly before the south tower fell and had seen his twin Andre’s fire engine going ahead of him. 'I said: “I love you”,' said Zachary. 'He said: “I love you too, bro”. You know, the weird thing about it is why did I say: “I love you”? I rarely told my brother I loved him. I mean, because we knew it. It was just something you knew.’ Meanwhile even today it was reported that the . twin sister of the beautiful model who lost her hand and left eye in a . plane accident in Plano, Texas, believes she can literally feel her sister's pain, according to her mother. Lauren . Scruggs had a horrific accident earlier this month when she . collided with a plane propeller.

"Earlier this year, a groundbreaking experiment claimed to have detected what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. Astronomers using the Bicep2 telescope said they found evidence for the faint microwave glow left over from the event that signalled the start of the universe. But since then the research has come under increasing scrutiny - and now scientists claim that if the results were true, the universe as we know it would not exist at all. New research from King's College London suggests that, if the Bicep2 results announced in March are correct, then the universe should have collapsed less than a second after the Big Bang (illustration shown), unless there is an unexplained realm of particle physics at work holding the cosmos together . According to astronomers from King's College London (KCL), the universe should have existed for no more than a second before collapsing. The research is the result of combining the latest observations of the sky, with the recent discovery of the Higgs boson. It was hailed as a groundbreaking experiment to detect what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. However, following a rash of criticism, the researchers behind the Bicep2 experiment hailed as a massive breakthrough have admitted they may have made a mistake. Last week the Bicep2 collaboration formally published its research in a peer reviewed journal - Physical Review Letters (PRL) - and a key researcher admitted even he has lost some confidence in the original results. In the paper, the US-led group stands by its work but accepts some big questions remain outstanding. 'Has my confidence gone down? Yes,' Professor Clem Pryke, from the University of Minnesota, told his audience at a public lecture in London. After the universe began in the Big Bang, it is thought to have gone through a short period of rapid expansion known as 'cosmic inflation'. Although the details of this process are not yet fully understood, cosmologists have been able to make predictions of how this would affect the universe we see today. In March 2014, researchers from the Bicep2 collaboration claimed to have detected one of these predicted effects. If . true, their results are a major advance in our understanding of . cosmology and a confirmation of the inflation theory, but they have . proven controversial and are not yet fully accepted by cosmologists. But in the new research, scientists from KCL investigated what the Bicep2 observations would mean for the stability of the universe - with surprising results. To do this, they combined the results with recent advances in particle physics. Gravitational waves from cosmic inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the universe. Shown here is the pattern observed with the Bicep2 telescope, providing what was thought at the time to be evidence for cosmic inflation after the Big Bang. The results have now been called into question . The Bicep2 telescope in Antarctica is seen here at twilight. The telescope has led to significant new results on the early universe, although its recent results have been called into question. The Keck Array telescope and the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station can be seen in the background . The detection of the Higgs boson by the Large Hadron Collider was announced in July 2012; since then, much has been learned about its properties. The Higgs boson's role is to give the particles that make up atoms their mass. It has been described as the ‘missing piece’ of the Standard Model, which explains how the parts of the universe that we understand interact with one another . Without this mass, particles would zip around the cosmos, unable to bind together to form the atoms that make stars and planets - and people. The particle was confirmed using the Large Hadron Collider - the highest-energy particle collider ever made, built by the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 2012. However, our knowledge of particle physics is still far from complete, with mysteries such as the nature of dark matter to still be solved. Measurements of the Higgs boson have allowed particle physicists to show that the universe sits in a valley of the 'Higgs field', which describes the way that other particles have mass. However, there is a different valley which is much deeper, but our universe is prevented from falling into it by a large energy barrier. The problem is that the Bicep2 results predict the universe would have received large 'kicks' during the cosmic inflation phase, pushing it into the other valley of the Higgs field within a fraction of a second. If that had happened, the universe would have quickly collapsed in a 'Big Crunch'. 'This is an unacceptable prediction of the theory because if this had happened we wouldn't be around to discuss it,' said Hogan, who is a PhD student at KCL and led the study. The scientists claim the Bicep2 results may contain an error; if not, there must be some other, as yet unknown, process which prevented the universe from collapsing. 'If Bicep2 is shown to be correct, it tells us that there has to be interesting new particle physics beyond the standard model,' Hogan said. Our universe lies in a 'valley', which sets the behaviour of the Higgs boson. Our universe is prevented from entering a deeper valley by a large 'hill'. During the early period of cosmic inflation, the Bicep2 results imply that the Universe would have received a 'kick' into the other valley, causing it to collapse in less than a second . The Bicep2 experiment was hailed as a look at the very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything when the universe expanded very rapidly - a theory called cosmic inflation. However, researchers later said the team did not take into account dust in the Milky Way galaxy, which may have rendered their readings useless. Two independent analyses now suggest that those twisting patterns in the CMB polarisation could just as easily be accounted for by the dust. And the team say there simply isn't enough data to rule out the dust theory.","In March 2014, the Bicep2 experiment found evidence of the universe expanding rapidly after the Big Bang, also known as 'cosmic inflation'

"A new study indicates that Americans gained up to 15 IQ points after the addition of iodine to salt became mandatory. In an effort to prevent goiter related to iodine deficiency, authorities ruled that iodine be added to U.S. salt products in 1924. The iodine, in addition to eliminating goiter, appears to have had an unexpected result: smarter Americans. Worth its salt: Iodized salt has had an unexpected impact the IQ of Americans since it was introduced in 1924 . In a report published in the National . Bureau of Economic Research, James Freyer, David Weil and Dimitra Politi . examined data from about two million enlistees for World War II born . between 1921 and 1927, comparing the intelligence levels of those born . just before 1924 and those born just after. To do this, they looked to standardized IQ tests that each recruit took as a part of the enlistment process. While the researchers didn't have access to the test scores themselves, they had another way of gauging intelligence levels: smarter recruits were sent to the Air Forces, while the less intelligent ones were assigned to the Ground Forces. Seaside: Communities by the ocean are much less likely to suffer iodine deficiency due to the high levels of iodine found in seafood, and other foods grown in iodine-rich soil . Next, the economists worked out likely iodine levels in different cities and towns around America using statistics gathered after World War I on the occurrence of goiter. Matching the recruits with their hometowns showed researchers that the men from low-iodine areas made a huge leap in IQ after the introduction of iodine. The men born in low-iodine areas after 1924 were much more likely to get into the Air Force and had an average IQ that was 15 points above that of their slightly older comrades. Necessary nutrient: While it's a mandatory addition to table salt, many sea salts and kosher salts don't have iodine added . This averages out to a 3.5 point rise in IQ levels across the nation. The World Health Organization backed up these results saying: . 'For iodine-deficient communities, between 10 and 15 IQ points may be lost when compared to similar but non-iodine-deficient populations.' Iodine . comes from food sources, and is especially abundant in seafood and . foods grown in coastal areas with high levels of iodine in the soil. Mountainous and inland areas are often very low in the nutrient, meaning food grown there doesn't have enough iodine. Today, iodine deficiency is the leading cause of preventable mental . retardation in the world. The condition, known as cretinism, was also . common in the U.S. until the introduction of iodized salt. Originally, U.S. authorities wanted to . reduce the incidence of goiter, but research since that time has shown that iodine plays an important role in . brain development, especially during gestation. The World Health Organization estimates that two billion people worldwide are at risk of iodine deficiency. And it's not just a Third World problem - the WHO reports that only 27 per cent of households in Europe have access to iodized salt. The researchers say that iodine may also be a cause of the so-called Flynn Effect, the steady rise in IQ that's been ongoing since the 1930s.","The U.S. introduced iodized salt in 1924 .

"A state prosecutor in Florida has come under fire after offensive posts dating back months were found on his personal Facebook account. Kenneth Lewis wrote about 'crack hoes' should get their 'tubes tied', how a young man who broke into a Florida home deserved to be killed by the homeowner, and how Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor was an example of the dangers of affirmative action. The Orlando-based prosecutor has not publicly commented since the offensive posts were revealed but his boss, the state attorney, has put out a statement hinting at their veracity. Under fire: Kenneth Lewis, who is believed to be 47, wrote controversial statements on his Facebook account but likely won't face any blowback from his job because of the First Amendment . Offensive: Lewis posted this rude note earlier this month and still has not taken it down . Outrageous: Lewis did not let his role as a lawyer and a state's attorney stop him from criticizing one of the country's highest judges . Lewis, who is married and believed to have at least one teenage son, does not seem bothered by the attention and his profile remains publicly open in spite of the scrutiny. Weighing in on cases: 'Stand your ground' laws are particularly sensitive in Florida but that didn't stop him from speaking definitively on a new case . Jezebel reported that he has taken down at least one post- but it was not an offensive one: he posted a link to a local news story about his Facebook musings with the caption 'apparently a slow news day in Orange County' on Wednesday but it is no longer visible on his profile. A collection of offensive posts remain, however. One of the most controversial came two weeks ago on Mother's Day, when he took aim at women who he believes are neglecting their children. 'Happy Mother's day to all the crack hoes out there. It' [sic] never too late to turn it around, tie our tubes, clean up your life and make a difference to someone out there that deserves a better mother,' the post read. Another of his posts attacks women, but this time taking aim at one of the most respected in the country: Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. On May 3, he posted a photo of Justice . Sotomayor and wrote the following caption: 'Reason enough why no . country should ever engage in the practice of Affirmative Action again. This could be the result. Where would she be if she didn't hit the quota . lottery? Here's a hint: ""Would you like to supersize that sir?""' As if that did not get enough attention, he shared it with his 220 friends again three days later. Lewis, who is believe to be 47 years old, regularly shares links to news stories and adds his take on the story in the caption. Hot topic: Angela Corey was the special prosecutor for the Trayvon Martin case and was the one to push for a murder charge, which some cited as a reason why George Zimmerman was found not guilty . In action: Lewis works as a state prosecutor in Orlando and regularly tries murder cases . One example of that came in January when he shared a report about a then-19-year-old who was arrested for attempted robbery and was restrained by the homeowners with a taser and 'brute force' until police arrived. 'They should have shot him in the head, anyone that invades another home in a violent manner should be executed on the spot,' Lewis wrote. Self defense and Stand Your Ground issues are particularly sensative issues in Florida especially in light of the Trayvon Martin shooting. Lewis, who is employed by the state's . attorney's office, didn't hold back from commenting on that case either, . writing at one point that he thought Florida residents should be . calling for the resignation of Angela Corey, the special prosecutor in . the Zimmerman case. Non-denial: He has not spoken publicly since the news broke but his office condemned his posts, making it clear that they were true . Free speech: Lewis regularly posted about people's right to free speech- even citing Donald Sterling and those who were outraged over homosexual NFL recruit Michael Sam's kiss as examples . In spite of the controversial statements, it does not appear that Lewis will face and formal reprimands as his supervisor already put out a statement both condemning and protecting Lewis' statements. 'I do not agree with the political sentiments expressed by (Kenneth Lewis) and I find some of the words he chose to be both offensive and dehumanizing. Political speech is protected by the first amendment of the United States Constitution and I do not police the private thoughts, views, or expressions of those in my employ,' state attorney Jeff Ashton said in a statement to local station WKMG.","Kenneth Lewis made controversial statements on his Facebook profile but is not facing any formal reprimand from his office .

"How about this for a slice of good fortune? When a woman forgot to pack her dinner she managed to avoid going hungry by dialing out for pizza. While there is nothing unusual in that, what made this takeaway particularly unique was the fact peckish passenger Lucie Mathieson was partway through a four-hour train journey to Manchester when she picked up the phone. And after two knock-backs, she finally managed to track down a pizza firm willing to rise to the challenge. Scroll down for video . Slice of luck: Lucie Mathieson tucks into her tasty pizza, which was delivered to her carriage on Sunday . The 25-year-old, who is originally from Hampton Court in London, was on the 5.50pm from Port Talbot in South Wales to Manchester on Sunday, when she and two friends hatched their plan. She said: 'We never thought it would work, but we needed some dinner. The . train set off at 5.50pm and wasn't getting in until 10.30pm. 'I asked the train conductor when we were getting in at each station, then started calling all the pizza places on the way. 'Two said 'no', but Joe at Pizza Hut . in Newport loved the idea. I said to him ""I've got a mission for you"" and he got very excited.' There was just a 50 second window for Joe to deliver the piping hot pizza to the BBC set designer when their two-carriage train - which did not have a buffet car or a trolley - pulled in to Newport station. Military precision: Lucie gets ready to make the leap onto the platform at Newport station where her pizzas are waiting for her . That's service: Pizza hut delivery man Jo hands over the goods to Lucie during the 50-second stop . As the train pulled in at 6.54pm, Joe was waiting for her with her dinner - one deep pan pepperoni pizza, one thin-crust chicken and mushroom, plus barbecue chicken wings and a side of garlic and herb dip. She had handed over the 'dough' earlier when she placed the order by telephone. It set the trio back just over £35, and to cap it all was delivered in exactly 30 minutes - normally the average wait for a pizza delivery is 40 minutes. Ms Mathieson jumped onto the platform, grabbed the goodies, and was back in her seat in less than 50 seconds ready to tuck into her teatime treat. She said: 'There were so many ways it could have gone wrong. We paid over the phone so Joe could have taken the money and not come. Timing: Lucie achieves the handover in the 50 second allotted time frame, while Joe waves goodbye . Food on the go: Lucie's food was delivered an hour into her four-and-a-half-hour journey . 'I don't know how he got on the station - we offered to pay for a ticket for him, but he didn't need it. 'But when he was there the whole station was cheering. By the time I got to Manchester all my friends were texting me saying I was on the front page of Reddit. 'I don't even know how I got there but everyone was posting it and commenting on it. I just can't believe we managed it.' After posting pictures of their dinner on Facebook, Ms Mathieson and her friends became an online hit. General manager of Newport Pizza Hut Delivery, Michelle Escott, said: 'When we got a call from a customer to deliver pizza to the Port Talbot to Manchester train we simply couldn't resist the challenge. 'The train was held at Newport station, which is in our delivery area, for less than a minute but our delivery driver got the pizzas to the train hot and bang on time.' Back on board: Lucie proudly shows off the fruits of her labour. Two pizza firms had turned her down before Pizza Hut agreed to her request .","Lucie Mathieson avoids going hungry on the 5.50pm from Port Talbot .

"Marvel Comics has run into trouble for its 'blatantly sexualised' cover of the new Spider-Woman comic. The comic will be in the shops in November and has two covers, one by Greg Land and the other by Milo Manara who is best known for his erotic illustrations. The one by Mr Manara features Jessica Drew as her alter-ego Spider-Woman – 'a woman with a mission' who 'just won't abide … being a target' – on all fours with her backside in the air and what looks like bodypaint rather than a costume. Too rude for Spider-Woman? The sexualised cover that is getting the critics up in arms . The controversial Spider-Woman cover by Milo Manara who is best known for his erotic illustrations . The comic – launched at Comic-Con in San Diego last month – will be written by Dennis Hopeless and illustrated by Greg Land but it is the alternative cover that has stoked anger from critics. The character of Spider-Woman comic first appeared in Marvel Spotlight #32 (cover-dated February 1977) as a one-off but was so popular she featured in a 50-episode series (April 1978-June 1983) before being killed off. In 2009, she was reborn in a seven-part series by Brian Michael Bendis. The new series written by Dennis Hopeless will be the third iteration. Spider-Woman's origin and basic character were designed by Archie Goodwin, while her visual appearance was created by freelancer Marie Severin. 'If you're wondering what the hell Jessica Drew, aka Spider-Woman is doing, I believe it's what's known in the animal kingdom as ""presenting"",' wrote science fiction site io9. 'She looks like she's wearing body-paint, and that's a big no-no for an industry still trying to remember that women exist and may perhaps read comics and also don't want to feel completely gross when they do so. As for the position she's in … Christ … Here's a simple rule: If it's inappropriate for a male character, it should also be inappropriate for a female character.' Laura Sneddon, a comics expert who blogs at comicbookgrrrl, told The Guardian that 'women do love superhero comics, and we even love a bit of cheesecake here and there, but this cover and the lack of thinking behind it is a prime example of why people continue to think superhero comics are for horny men only.' The male version: Peter Parker as Spider-Man. He could go anywhere a spider can . She added: 'I think it's a really disappointing decision by Marvel editorial to choose this kind of artist for a variant cover on a female-lead comic. There's a time and a place for Milo Manara's style of work, but it's in erotic comics rather than superhero comics, or at least he could be asked to reduce the sexualised lens for this very different audience.' Pop culture site the Mary Sue added that 'anyone familiar with pornography knows this pose … ripped straight from the fantasy medium', pointing out its similarity to one Manara had already drawn in an Italian erotic comic. 'This is what we talk about when we ask comic publishers not to actively offend their paying (or potentially paying) customers,' wrote the Mary Sue's Jill Pantozzi. 'It's important to note, Manara is known for erotic art, and there's absolutely a place for that. But was he the best choice to promote this particular comic? I would say unequivocally no.' Marvel has yet to respond, but Mr Hopeless tweeted: 'I can promise you we have no intention of blatantly sexualising any of the characters in our story', and 'I don't have any input at all on covers. You have my word that our story treats Jess with the utmost respect.' Stan Lee, the creator of Spider-Man, the Hulk, X-Men, Fantastic Four and other comic-book heroes . Marvel is trying to attract a bigger female audience and this summer said that its new comic Thor would have the Norse god as a goddess. 'The new Thor continues Marvel's proud tradition of strong female characters like Captain Marvel, Storm, Black Widow and more,' the publisher said at the time. 'And this new Thor isn't a temporary female substitute – she's now the one and only Thor, and she is worthy!'","Third version of Spider-Woman comic to be launched in November .

"The director of the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System received an $8,500 performance bonus in April while the agency's inspector general investigated the deaths of 40 veterans there due to mismanaged waiting lists. Sharon Helman also got a $9,345 bonus in 2013. A red-faced VA was forced to rescind the bonuses on Wednesday after a member of Congress blew the whistle on national television. As the scandal deepens, two Democrats have broken a partisan logjam by demanding the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Sharon Helman, the director of the scandal-plagued Phoenix VA Health Care System, got performance bonuses in 2013 and again just last month . Rep. David Scott, a George Democrat, blasted the VA secretary Wednesday on the House floor and demanded his ouster . Gen. Eric Shinseki, the embattled VA secretary, is under intense fire from both sides of the political aisle, but President Barack Obama is defending him -- at least for now . Florida Republican Rep. Jeff Miller blasted the VA during an interview Wednesday afternoon on CNN, saying that Helman 'received an $8,500 bonus last month while there was an open IG investigation into Phoenix.' 'And they are trying to say that it was a low-level person [who] made an administrative error. ... This has got to stop,' he insisted. The VA said hours later that 'Secretary Shinseki today exercised his authority to rescind Sharon Helman’s fiscal year 2013 performance award immediately. Previously, Ms. Helman received the performance award due to an administrative error.' Her annual salary, not including bonuses, is $169,900. As the crisis gathers steam inside the Obama administration, two House Democrats have joined a chorus of Republicans in demanding Shinseki's resignation. Georgia Rep. John Barrow – who faces a tough re-election battle this year in a district where Republican voters outnumber Democrats – slammed the White House for having 'fallen short in providing the kind of care that our veterans have earned.' 'While I don't think a change in leadership will immediately solve the serious problems that plague the VA,' Barrow said shortly after President Barack Obama addressed the VA scandal in a press conference, 'I do think it's time to give someone else an opportunity to lead the agency and begin the rebuilding process to ensure these issues never happen again.' 'Secretary Shinseki deserves the utmost respect for his service,' he added, 'but it's time for someone new to get to the bottom of what's happened on his watch.' Rep. John Barrow, a Georgia Democrat who faces re-election in a Republican-dominated district, as the first Dem to call for Shinseki's ouster . An angry John Boehner said he's getting perilously close to demanding Shinseki's resignation . Obama said Wednesday after he met with Shinseki and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors that he would reserve judgment on the VA secretary's future until an inspector general report hit his desk . Obama assured Americans that 'if these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable, it is disgraceful, and I will not tolerate it.' He has been reluctant to sack Shinseki, even after VA Undersecretary for Health Dr. Robert Petzel resigned on May 16, insisting that the inspector general report – due weeks from now – would guide his actions. Meanwhile, Georgia Democratic Rep. David Scott said Wednesday on the House floor that 'the first person we need to fire is the secretary of Veterans Affairs.' 'We respect him, we respect his sacrifice for his country and everything else, but the buck stops at the top.' Scott doubled down with a rare rebuke of Obama. 'I was very disappointed with President Obama today.,' he said. 'There was no urgency. Mr. President, we need urgency.' 'We need you to roll up your sleeves and get into these hospitals!' During his weekly press briefing, a booming-voiced House Speaker John Boehner nearly yelled his support for veterans. 'We've not just let them down, we've let them die, and somebody ought to be held accountable for it!' he said.","Democratic Reps.

"As swarms of locust devour Egyptian crops, the Middle East is bracing for the destructive bugs to migrate their way ahead of the Passover holiday. A swarm of an estimated 30million insects has been devastating crops in Egypt, fuelling apocalyptic fears because of the infestation’s proximity to the Bible story of Passover in which a swarm of locusts, the eighth of ten plagues, is imposed on Egyptians by God for enslaving and abusing ancient Hebrews. Israel’s Agriculture Ministry set up an emergency hotline today and urged residents to be vigilant in reporting sightings of the insects to prevent an outbreak. Swarms descending: A swarm of an estimated 30million locust has descended on Egypt (including these insects seen over the Al-Mogattam district of Cairo) as Israel braces for the infestation to head their way . A special task force has also been set up to help farmers manage infestations. The locusts pass through the country as part of their normal . migration from north east Sudan to Saudi Arabia, the Egyptian Agriculture Ministry said, emphasising that Egypt was just ‘a transfer station’ for the locusts, which were in larger . numbers this year. As the insects descended on agricultural farms in Giza and in Cairo, causing significant damage, fears have been raised that they could spread to Israel. Battle with the bugs: Residents in Cairo burn tyres to create black smoke to deter the locust settling there as Israel's Agriculture Ministry set up an emergency hotline and urged residents to be vigilant in reporting sightings of the insects . Passover plague: The bugs have fueled apocalyptic fears because of the infestation's proximity to the Bible story of Passover in which a swarm of locusts, the eighth of ten plagues, is imposed on Egyptians by God for enslaving and abusing ancient Hebrews . In a statement from the Food and . Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the infestation was . described as a ‘immature swarm’ which ‘appeared in the afternoon (on . March 2) in the eastern Cairo districts of New Cairo and Mokattam and . dispersed into several smaller swarmlets’. The statement read: ‘The locusts . originated from breeding that has been in progress since November in . southeast Egypt between Berenice and the Sudanese border. Killing crops: As the locusts have descended on agricultural farms in Giza and in Cairo, they have caused significant damage to agriculture . ‘As . vegetation dried out, small groups and swarms of immature adults moved . slowly north along the Red Sea coast, reaching Marsa Alam on 8 February, . Hurghada on the 16th and Zafarana on the 26th.’ As well as Israel, Lebanon and Jordan have been alerted. In Cairo, people were burning tyres to . create black smoke to deter the locust from settling and there were . reports that swarms had been seen in Zafarana, about 124 miles from . Cairo, on the Red Sea and in the city of Qena, where the insects have . been sighted in at least three villages. According to the Israel National News, . the Egyptian Agriculture Minister Dr Salah Abd Al Mamon said: ‘Egyptian . armed forces and border guards are attempting to fight the swarm with . all means at their disposal. ‘I ask the families living in the locust-plagues areas not to burn tyres. This does not chase away the locusts, but only causes damage and could ignite largescale fires that would cost in lives.’ He said that strong winds were predicted in weather forecasts and he hoped that this would force the insects to migrate toward the Red Sea and Saudi Arabia. Crop duster planes were also going to be used to handle the infestation. Egypt and Israel was infested with . locust in 2004. Israeli agriculture officials sent crop dusters into the . air to spray against the locusts that swept in from North Africa in the . first such invasion since 1959. The Egyptian Agriculture Ministry said that the locusts pass through the country as part of their normal migration from north east Sudan to Saudi Arabia, reaffirming that Egypt is just 'a transfer station' for the locusts . Farmers in 15 out of the 27 Egyptian governorates suffered significant agricultural damage as the insects devoured crops and flowers. This year Passover will begin on the evening of March 25 and end on the evening of April 2. The infestation comes as a study warns that yellow-legged Asian hornets that prey on bees are among the latest non-native species threatening UK wildlife, and even people’s health. A growing number of alien species, from killer shrimps to Spanish slugs, are set to soon reach our shores, a Europe-wide study warns. The Asian hornet, which grows to between 2.5cm and 3cm (1-1.2 inches), preys on native honeybees, wasps and other pollinators, potentially devastating hives and threatening honey and crop production.","Israel's Agriculture Ministry set up an emergency hotline and task force .

"A woman who fought and killed a hitman sent by her husband to murder her eight years ago has told how she is living in fear as her jailed ex's release date draws near. Susan Walters has devised a 'run plan' to go into hiding if she feels threatened and has drawn up a will in case a second attempt on her life succeeds. The terrified 59-year-old has also laid gravel around her house in order to hear the crunch of approaching footsteps and installed a new security system. Living in fear: Susan Walters shows a picture of the hammer used by the  hitman at her husband's trial in 2007. He is to be released later this year after serving eight years in prison . In 2006, her estranged husband Michael Kuhnhausen agreed to pay crack addict Edward Haffey $50,000 to bludgeon her to death with a hammer and make it look like a burglary gone wrong. Haffey broke into Ms Walters's home in Portland, Oregon, and lay in wait for her to return. When she walked through the door he attacked her with the hammer, hitting her repeatedly around the head. Threat? Ms Walters is terrified that her husband Michael Kuhnhausen, might organise another attempt on her life . But Ms Walters fought back, and in a desperate struggle that lasted an estimated 15 minutes she wrestled him to the ground and grabbed him round the throat. She relaxed her grip demanding to know who had sent him, but when he tried to break free she choked him to death. Notes found in Haffey's backpack linked him to Kuhnhausen, who was arrested and pleaded guilty to soliciting to commit aggravated murder. In a plea deal he was sentenced to just 10 years in prison and that was reduced to eight on grounds of good behaviour, meaning he will walk free in September. In 2008, Ms Walters sued Kuhnhausen, whom she had been married to for 17 years, for $1 million claiming emotional distress, saying she did not want him to have enough money to hire a hitman again. Kuhnhausen, who will be 66 when he is released, insists he is not a threat and that he has terminal prostate cancer, meaning he would be too weak to exact any sort of revenge. But that has only made Ms Walters more frightened because she beliecves that if he is terminally ill then he's 'not got a lot to lose.' She told the Oregonian: 'It’s disturbing that he’s getting out, but I know I can’t keep him there. 'I’ve spent the last eight years hoping and praying he doesn’t have any hidden funds anywhere. 'I’m hoping he hasn’t found someone in prison who said, ‘You just hired the wrong guy.’ Ms Walters was awarded the Portland Police Bureau's Civilian Medal of Heroism, honoring her 'sheer determination' to survive. Battered: Pictures produced at her husband's trial show the extent of Ms Walters's injuries. She fought a desperate battle with crack addict Edward Haffey which only ended when she choked him to death . Good behaviour: Michael Kuhnhausen is due to be released in September this year after serving just eight years for organising the hit . But she says she has been left traumatised and paranoid and breaks down in tears if forced to relive the terrible experience. She now hopes to persuade the Oregon Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision to impose additional conditions on Kuhnhausen, banning him from entering the county where she is now living. She added: 'I wish him peace, and I wish for him to live far away from me.'","In 2006 Susan Walters killed crack addict hitman  Edward Haffey .

"Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius said Thursday that 7.5 million Americans had enrolled in Obamacare insurance coverage by the time the dust settled on April 1, but reused to tell senators how many of them were already covered before the law took full effect. The question is an important one: Republicans claim that most of those who signed up are Americans who lost their existing policies in 2013 because they didn't meet the Affordable Care Act's strict and sometimes bewildering minimum standards. President Barack Obama promised that his signature insurance overhaul law would dramatically reduce the ranks of the uninsured. Democrats hope the numbers turn out to show he's delivered on that pledge.

It's possible that both sides could be right on the question of the law's impact. A RAND Corporation report released days ago estimates that 9.3 million people are newly insured since the Obamacare law kicked in. But a large majority of those gains are due to Americans who received new coverage from their employers, not through the government-run insurance exchanges. And RAND concluded that some of the uptick was due to the normal churn of the industry, which sees new insurance customers entering the marketplace and others dropping out every month. The report also found that 5.2 million Americans lost their coverage in the wake of the Affordable Care Act's calamitous fall rollout. Sebelius touted RAND's 9.3 million statistic in her testimony on Thursday. Hatch insisted that her claimed pool of 7.5 million enrollees will inevitably shrink once people are challenged to pay for their new medical insurance, likening it to some online shopping that stops before getting to a virtual checkout. 'Indeed, it's like Amazon.com taking stock of how many people have placed items in their shopping carts and then counting them as sales,' he said. 'In other words it’s a false metric.' Fair question: Sen. Orrin Hatch (L) asked Sebelius what the net effect of Obama has been -- not just how many enrollments governments have seen online . No matter whose version of reality prevails, Democrats face a perception problem and almost certain electoral defeats in September because of the well-publicized problems with the law's rollout, its increased costs and the limited scope of doctor networks in the insurance plans it includes. The Pew Research Center and USA Today released poll numbers Thursday from April 3-6, showing that 53 per cent of Americans disapprove of the law, while just 41 per cent support it. And 64 per cent of Republican registered voters said a candidate's position on Obamacare will be 'very important' in their Election Day decisions, compared with only 52 per cent of Democrats. An editorial writer in Investor's Business Daily claimed Thursday that the Obama administration might be cooking the books. Using data released by the 14 states – plus the District of Columbia – which run their own exchanges, added to the public totals of seven states that participated in the healthcare.gov exchange, the paper's John Merline determined that Sebelius' number could only be correct if 29 states added nearly 2 million Obamacare enrollees in March alone. That metric would represent 'an eye-popping 90% increase in just the last month,' he wrote.","HHS secretary told senators 'I do not have data to give you right now' showing how many enrollees are actually new insurance customers .
She proudly said that 7.5 million people have chosen health plans, but it's unclear how many have paid their premiums .
Democrats still face November headaches as a large majority of Americans say they don't like the new law and it will affect their votes .
Investors Business Daily doubts White House numbers, saying a small number of states had to have shown massive enrollment growth last month ."
"FBI Director James Comey testified Wednesday that he believes the 2009 mass shooting at Fort Hood in Texas was inspired by al-Qaeda. Major Nidal Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, opened fire on his fellow servicemen and women on November 5, 2009, killing 13 and injuring 30 others. He was shot and paralyzed from the waist down in the resulting hail of gunfire, and was sentenced to death in 2013. The federal government has termed the attack an incidence of 'workplace violence,' saying that the home-grown Hasan didn't meet the legal definition of an international terrorist. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, however, elicited the first confirmation from the Obama administration that the 'terror' label might apply. FBI Director James Comey confirmed that he believes the Fort Hood shooting was a terrorist act, not a case of 'workplace violence' Sen. John Cornyn represents Texas, where the shooting took place, and has tried for years to establish that Maj. Nidal Hasan was a terrorist and not just a disgruntled Army employee . The Fort Hood shooting in 2009 left 13 corpses and 30 serious injuries in its wake . Mourners: Fort Hood wept as one during a memorial service the day after the Islamist Hasan opened fire and spilled the blood of his fellow servicemen and women . 'In your opening statement you mentioned al-Qaeda-inspired terrorism,' Cornyn said during a Judiciary Committee hearing, 'and I know you’re familiar, if not specifically, generally with the facts of the 2009 attack at Fort Hood, Texas, when Major Nidal Hasan shot and killed 13 people, injured a couple dozen plus more.' 'Do you agree with the intelligence community’s assessment that Hasan was inspired by Al Qaeda to conduct that attack?' he asked. 'Yes, sir,;' Comey replied. 'Based on everything I’ve read – again, I wasn’t in office at the time – but I’ve read about it since, and I do.' The White House did not respond to a request for comment about whether the administration stands by its 'workplace violence' determination. Because the shooting wasn't considered a terror attack, victims and their families haven't received the same benefits and payments as they would have on the battlefield or in an al-Qaeda strike in the Middle East. Cornyn introduced legislation last year that would 'correct this inequity,' according to a statement his office released on Wednesday. Hasan was prosecuted under murder statutes, not terrorism laws, despite the fact that U.S. intelligence agencies knew he was associating with Islamist terror suspects including Anwar al-Awlaki, whom the U.S. killed in a 2011 drone strike. In one of 18 emails to the terror ringleader that American agents intercepted in 2008 and 2009, Hasan indicated his intentions. 'I can't wait to join you' in the afterlife,' he wrote. A military jury sentenced Nidal Hasan to death for the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood that killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others in Killeen, Texas . First responders prepared wounded for transport and pronounced the casualties' deaths outside Fort Hood's Soldier Readiness Processing Center on November 5, 2009 . Like Hasan, the al-Qaeda-linked Anwar al-Awlaki was born in the U.S.; he praised the Army murderer after the 2009 massacre . Hasan's Army business cards included the acronyms 'SoA(SWT),' which mean 'Soldier of Allah (Glory to God).' Following the shooting, al-Awlaki praised his actions. Some radical Muslim individuals and groups have claimed the events in Islamist terms for political purposes. After the Fort Hood shooting, Anwar al-Awlaki praised Hasan's actions. 'Nidal Hassan is a hero,' he wrote on his blog. 'He is a man of conscience who could not bear living the contradiction of being a Muslim and serving in an army that is fighting against his own people. ... The U.S. is leading the war against terrorism which in reality is a war against Islam.' Months later during his lengthy legal proceedings, Hasan won the support of al-Qaeda spokesman Adam Yahiye Gadahn, who called him a 'Mujahid brother. Hasan, he wrote, 'has shown us what one righteous Muslim with an assault rifle can do for his religion and brothers in faith.'","Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn asked FBI Director James Comey if he believes the 2009 mass shooting was inspired by al-Qaeda .
'Yes sir. ... I do,' he replied .

"Honduran President Juan Hernandez (pictured in January) wants more aid for Central America from the U.S. Honduran President Juan Hernandez has blamed U.S. drug policy for sparking violence in Central American countries and driving a surge of migration to the United States, according to an interview published today. Hernandez, who took office in January after winning on a pledge to be tough on crime, said only a drop in violence would curb the wave of families and unaccompanied minors fleeing Central America. A surge in minors leaving Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have overwhelmed temporary detention facilities on the U.S. border. 'Honduras has been living in an emergency for a decade,' Hernandez told Mexican daily newspaper Excelsior. 'The root cause is that the United States and Colombia carried out big operations in the fight against drugs. Then Mexico did it.' Those operations pushed drug traffickers into Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, he suggested, adding: 'This is creating a serious problem for us that sparked this migration.' Hernandez said more resources were needed in Central America to fight drug gangs and he said his country was deserving of U.S. aid similar to the programs that funded anti-drug operations in Colombia and Mexico. Honduras has the highest murder rate in the world. Drug-related killings have increased in recent years since Mexico's drug cartels expanded into the country, enlisting local street gangs and using the country's Caribbean coast to transport South American cocaine to the United States. 'A good part of (migration) has to do with the lack of opportunities in Central America, which has its origin in the climate of violence, and this violence, almost 85 per cent of it, is related to the issue of drug trafficking,' he said. Deportees pictured lining up outside a bus at the Care Center for Returning Migrants (CAMR) after arriving on an immigration flight from the U.S., at the international airport in San Pedro Sula in June . Thousands of Central American migrants are streaming into the United States through Mexico, and those caught are being held in overcrowded detention facilities. U.S. immigration officials have said the crisis is being driven by poverty, gang and drug violence in Central America. It is also fueled by rumors perpetuated by smugglers that children who reach the U.S. border will be permitted to stay. U.S. President Barack Obama has asked lawmakers for $3.7 billion to pay for more border security, temporary detention centers and additional immigration court judges to process asylum cases and speed up deportations. The Obama administration projects more than 150,000 unaccompanied children under the age of 18 could next year flee Central America and seek to enter the United States. Women and their children wait in line to register at the Honduran Center for Returned Migrants after being deported from Mexico in June .","President Hernandez blames U.S., Mexico and Colombia for fighting drug operations that pushed the traffickers into Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador .

"Speaking for the first time since her ordeal, Jessica Davies said she feared for her life when two men forced their way into her room . The British woman who leapt from a hotel balcony in India to escape a sex attack has spoken for the first time about her ordeal – and lambasted the attitudes of Indian men towards women. Jessica Davies, who had been travelling alone across India for three weeks when last week’s incident occurred, said she feared for her life when two men tried to force their way into her room at a hotel near the Taj Mahal. Her terrifying experience – which has resulted in Sachin Chauhan, the owner of the Hotel Agra Mahal in Agra, northern India, facing charges of harassment – follows two recent gang rapes in the country. Miss Davies, 31, said she wanted to speak out to warn all women travelling in India that they needed to be  aware of their personal safety. She said: ‘The way the men treat women and their attitude to sexual harassment and sexual assault is wrong. If they don’t think there is anything wrong with their attitudes and behaviour, this kind of thing will carry on.’ Miss Davies, a dental hygienist from Greenwich, South-East London, said she had stayed at the hotel for two nights. ‘There have been reports that I asked the owner of the hotel for a wake-up call at 3.45am on the morning he came to my room, but that is untrue. ‘He just turned up at my door, knocked and, when I opened it, was standing there holding two bottles of massage oil. He told me he wanted to give me a free massage and shower. He was drunk. ‘I don’t know why he targeted me because I hadn’t had any other problems with him. Maybe it’s because I’m small and he knew I was in the room on my own.’ Miss Davies, who returned to the UK on Friday after giving a statement to the police in Agra, said when she refused he tried to enter the room – but she managed to push him back and lock the door. She says he continued knocking on the door for ten minutes, so she screamed for help and began hitting the door in the hope it would wake other guests. Miss Davies said that the owner was still trying to force his way into the room after 45 minutes. When she heard the voice of a second man asking to come into the room, she shouted at them to go away, told them they were scaring her and pushed a table, with her rucksack on top, against the door. ‘I noticed the balcony door lock wasn’t secured,’ she added. ‘I fully believed they would eventually enter my room from the balcony and get inside with the intention of raping me.’ At 5am, an hour and a quarter after the ordeal began, Miss Davies realised no one was coming to help her and decided to jump from her second-floor balcony. Police have arrested the hotel's owner, Sachin Chauhan, pictured, and said it could be six months to a year before the case goes to court . ‘I got dressed, tucked my passport into the waistband of my trousers and climbed over the balcony. I couldn’t make a call on my mobile to get help because it wasn’t working. ‘I didn’t take any of my other stuff, and I didn’t go back for it afterwards. I just wanted to escape.’ She jumped from her second-floor balcony to one on the first floor – and then from there to the ground, injuring her right leg as she landed. She then ran to a nearby road and flagged down a rickshaw driver, who took her to the local police station. ‘I really can’t thank that rickshaw driver enough,’ said Miss Davies, who is still limping badly and has extensive bruising around her foot and ankle. ‘I really do think I’ve been very lucky. I only have superficial injuries to my leg but I am still shocked and feeling anxious about what happened. The Indian police said it could be six months to a year before the case goes to court but when it does, I’m going to be ready for it. ‘I will go back if I have to in order to give evidence.’ Just days before the incident, Indian police said a Swiss cyclist was gang-raped after she and her husband were attacked while camping. And, last December, the fatal gang rape of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, on a bus in Delhi, provoked international revulsion.","Jessica Davies speaks for the first time of her ordeal in Agra, India .

"A mother is taking legal action after claiming doctors at a hospital wrongly advised her to abort her ‘brain dead’ baby. During her 24-week pregnancy scan, Sarah Hagan says medics at Sunderland Royal Hospital told her the child would have ‘no hope of survival’. Ms Hagan went through the agony of taking tablets to abort her unborn son, only to be told doctors were going to try and deliver her baby. Sarah Hagan, 38, says that medics at Sunderland Royal Hospital told her that Aaron (pictured) should be aborted because he was 'brain dead' and had 'no hope of survival' Ms Hagan, 38, of Farringdon, Sunderland, said: ‘It breaks my heart every day when I look at my son and think how I almost got rid of him.’ Now, the mother of two, along with partner Darren Perry, 25, has begun legal proceedings against City Hospitals Sunderland, after claiming she was told her baby’s brain had not formed properly, her only option was a termination and that her child could be born with one eye. As a result of being born so early, Ms Hagan says Aaron, now 15-months-old, has suffered a catalogue of health problems including chronic lung issues and a cyst on the brain. She said: ‘If I had been allowed to go longer into the pregnancy, I am sure he wouldn’t have had any of these problems. ‘Now, despite being told he was brain dead, Aaron’s brain is on par with any other baby of his age. ‘Despite what they said, he was born breathing and kicking. ‘When I look at him now, I can’t believe what almost happened because someone made a presumption from a scan. ‘I just want other mothers to know my story so that nothing like this happens again.’ Ms Hagan says that she was given drugs to abort Aaron (pictured) but that when they failed to work another doctor said that he needed to be delivered. He was born prematurely weighing just 1lb 7oz . Ms Hagan went for her 24-week scan on May 4 last year. Supported by her mother, Val, 66, medics took her into a consulting room where Ms Hagan says she was told her baby’s brain had not formed. ‘I just broke down in tears,’ she recalled. ‘My mum asked if the baby would survive, and we were told there was no hope of survival. ‘They said I could take tablets or be sent through to Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary where they could perform a foetal heart stop.’ Left overnight to consider her options, Ms Hagan slept little and finally decided to take the tablets. Ms Hagan said: 'It breaks my heart every day when I look at my son and think how I almost got rid of him.' Image shows Sunderland Royal Hospital where Ms Hagan says she was told Aaron was brain dead . ‘I took them believing that a termination was the only way. They even told me they would have to carry out a post mortem examination to find out what had gone wrong. ‘By Wednesday, May 9, I was back at the hospital because the tablets didn’t seem to be working. ‘I was seen by another medic who asked if I’d spoken to a neo-natal doctor. ‘I said “no” and he seemed flabbergasted. So they sent for one who then examined me and said he was going to deliver my baby.’ Aaron Hagan Perry was born on Thursday, May 10, weighing just 1lb 7oz. He was immediately put on a ventilator and also suffered an almost fatal infection and heart condition. A spokeswoman for Sunderland Royal Hospital said: 'The Trust can confirm that it is aware of the legal action being taken by Ms Hagan and it would be clearly inappropriate to offer any detail or comment on the case at this present time' However, after almost two months in the neo-natal unit, he started to show signs of recovery. Ms Hagan, also mother to six-month-old Harry, said: ‘I still find it hard to believe they could get it so wrong, that it was just presumed my baby would not survive. ‘When I look at him now and think what could have happened, it brings me to tears.’ A spokeswoman for Sunderland Royal Hospital said: ‘The Trust can confirm that it is aware of the legal action being taken by Ms Hagan and her partner and it would be clearly inappropriate to offer any detail or comment on the case at this present time. ‘The Trust recognises that this is a distressing time for both Ms Hagan and her partner.’","Mother-of-two Sarah Hagan is suing City Hospitals Sunderland .

"First came the alleged divorce threats. And now Matt Lauer's wife has taken to chaperoning him in her latest quest to control his roving eye. It was reported today that Annette Roque and their there children will be accompanying her husband to London when he travels there next month to report on the 2012 Olympics. Not only that, but Lauer and his family will stay in a different hotel to the rest of the NBC cast and crew, according to RadarOnline. Chaperone: Annette Roque is said to be accompanying her husband Matt Lauer to London for the Olympics so she can keep a close eye on him . Co-host: Matt Lauer's wife allegedly said she would divorce him if Natalie Morales, left, took over from Ann Curry as the two were rumored to have had an affair. But Savannah Guthrie, right, took the chair . A source told the website: 'Annette and the kids will all be going to the Olympics so she can keep . very close tabs on Matt, and he and his family will be staying at a different . hotel than the rest of the cast and crew. 'Annette generally doesn't like . to accompany Matt when he travels for work, but it's the Olympics and . the kids are very excited. 'It's hard to travel with three kids and . Annette enjoys spending the summer at their Hamptons mansion where they . live full-time now but Annette has made it very clear the whole family . will be heading to London. Annette has made no bones about the fact she . will be keeping close tabs on Matt.' The news comes just days after it was revealed that Annette allegedly threatened to divorce Lauer if Natalie Morales - who he is accused of having had an affair with - took Ann Curry's co-anchor spot on the Today show. A source close to Lauer's wife told the The National Enquirer: 'When . she heard about Ann getting the boot, the first thing she told Matt was . that she didn't want him cozying up any closer to Natalie. In her tearful farewell Ann Curry said: 'I did . not expect to leave this couch after 15 years but I am so grateful, . especially to everyone who watched. We often call ourselves a family but the viewers are the real family' Team: Natalie Morales - who is one of the people . poised to take over from Ann - holds the co-hosts hand as she . reminisces over her time on the show . 'In fact, Annette drew a line in the sand and said if he pushed show bosses to make Natalie his new co-host, she'd divorce him. 'Annette knows Matt is the key to the Today franchise and his bosses will put whoever he wants in the co-host chair.' Lauer, who is said to have signed a . $25million deal earlier this year to stay with Today, was accused of . having an affair with Ms Morales when they were covering the Winter Olympics in Italy in 2006. Though he denied claims, they were enough to prompt a then-pregnant Annette to file for divorce - which she later withdrew. However . two years later, there was speculation Lauer was the father of one of Ms . Morales' children. She is married to Joe Rhodes and the couple have two . children together. Annette lives in the couple's $3.5million house in the Hamptons with their three children. Lauer only sees them at weekends. Accompanying her husband to the London Olympics will be the second victory for Annette as it was actually Savannah Guthrie who appeared in Ann Curry's place on the Today show this morning, less than 24 hours after the 55-year-old bid a tearful farewell. Surprise: NBC was due to make an official . announcement after the show finished, although the appointment was . widely reported before then . Rumors abounded that Lauer was pivotal in ousting Ann from the seat, believing they 'lacked chemistry'. She was also blamed for the falling ratings which saw ABC's Good Morning America take the lead for the first time in 16 years. Ann broke down in tears as she said goodbye on this morning's show, apologizing to fans for not being able to 'take the ball all the way to the finish line' but saying she 'tried her best'. In an interview with USA Today the night before her departure, Ann insisted she was not to blame for the ratings drop. She said: 'I know I am not to blame for the ratings worries. And my bosses have said to me there are many factors involved. There is no doubt that the rating wars have become meaner and less focused on our responsibilities as journalists.' Viewers were this morning greeted by the sight of a beaming Guthrie sitting on the sofa instead of Curry, in what felt like a surreal transition as there was no on-air announcement of the changing of the guard.","Comes days after she allegedly threatened to divorce him if Natalie Morales took over from Ann Curry .

"Vice President Joe Biden will meet with senior representatives of Latin American countries this week to 'emphasize that illegal immigration is not safe' and clear up 'misconceptions' about the U.S.'s policy on child immigration, a senior White House official said Sunday. The senior official told reporters on a conference call that a visit to Guatemala had been added to Biden's schedule at the last minute so he could meet with representatives of the governments of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to discuss the 'root causes' behind the apparent flood of unaccompanied minors leaving their countries to illegally immigrate to the U.S. Biden's sudden visit to Guatemala is the Obama administration's latest effort to mitigate criticism that it encouraged thousands of children and teenagers to make the dangerous trek to the U.S. when it announced two years ago that it would stop deporting children of illegal immigrants. Flood: Don Ray, the Executive Director of the Texas Border Sheriffs Coalition compared the situation to the displacement of people following Hurricane Katrina . Sickness: Thousands of children have been transported to Nogales, Arizona, and have reportedly become sickened by the food they have been given at the shelter . Young faces: The pictures, taken recently, show just how many of the illegal immigrants are children -- many of whom have no supervising adult. Up to 400 a day are pouring over the border . The vice president, however, has attracted his own share of eye-rolls with recent comments about immigration. On June 10 he told an audience at the National Association of Manufacturers that the U.S. economy needs a 'constant, unrelenting stream' of immigrants to continue coming across the border. 'Not dribbling,' he insisted. 'Significant flows.' Obama's 2012 policy shift wasn't meant to apply to the children now crossing the border illegally. But 33,000 unaccompanied minors have made the hazardous trip from Mexico to Texas since October,thinking they would be able to stay in the United States once they arrived. 'We are seeing hundreds turning themselves in daily. And I mean hundreds . at a time,' Chris Cabrera, a chapter leader of the . National Border Patrol Council, told CNN last week. 'They know that once they . get to the station, we are going to give them paperwork and we are . going to set them free into the United States,' he said. The Christian Science Monitor says the Obama administration estimates that roughly 80,000 illegal immigrant children will seek safe haven in the U.S. this year. Twelve times as many kids are coming north illegally this year as the year before president Obama instituted the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Cheek-by-jowl: The immigrants are crammed in tiny rooms and forced to sleep on the floor with aluminium blankets as their only comfort . Conspiracy: An association of former border guards has accused the government of deliberately 'orchestrating' the flood of minors for 'political reasons' 'The . recent surge of children and teenagers from Central America showing up . at our southern border is an administration-made disaster,' Virginia GOP . Rep. Bob Goodlatte, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, recently told Fox . News. 'Word has gotten out around the world . about President Obama's lax immigration enforcement policies and it has . encouraged more individuals to come to the United States illegally,' Goodlatte said in a statement. A report last week found that many of the children being held in U.S. detention facilities had not bathed in days and were sleeping on plastic boards because holding facilities didn't have enough mattresses to go around. Leaked . photos from one base that were obtained by Breitbart News show hundreds of children holed up in crowded concrete rooms, sleeping on the bare floor without blankets or pillows. 'Most of the time, . they're getting released to relatives in the U.S.' Cabrera told CNN. 'There's nowhere to put them, so they're released on their own . recognizance and have a pending court date.' 'I'd say between 95 and 97 per cent . of adults or youths don't show up for court.' Vice President Joe Biden will meet with senior representatives of Latin America countries this week to 'emphasize that illegal immigration is not safe' and clear up 'misconceptions' about the U.S.'s policy on child immigration, a senior White House official said Sunday . President Barack Obama has called the influx of unaccompanied minors into the U.S. an urgent humanitarian . situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response' and has announced an 'interagency Unified Coordination Group to ensure unity of effort across . the executive branch in responding to the humanitarian aspects of this . situation' to be headed up by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Now, the president has commissioned Biden to travel overseas to have 'intensive consultations' with the governments of the children's home countries. During his meetings Biden will talk with government officials from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras about how the U.S. wants to work together 'to try to make life better for these families and children in all of the countries of Central America,' a senior administration official said. Biden is also expected to speak publicly about the issue, but the Obama administration official could offer no other details on when and where that might happen. The administration official told reporters that Biden would stress in his remarks publicly and privately that, 'Putting your child in the hands of a criminal smuggling organization is not safe, and it is not worth subjecting children to a perilous journey when there is no light at the end of the tunnel.'","VP Joe Biden plans to tell Latin American nations' representatives that it's unsafe for minor children to travel hundreds of miles alone to the US .

"Three weeks after it was revealed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting a second child, some punters are placing sums of at least £1,000 on its name. And with speculation rife as to what Prince William and Kate will call their new child, one of the most authoritative of royal authors claimed today that he is convinced they will name it after Diana. Andrew Morton - who wrote a biography of the Princess of Wales which revealed the truth behind her strained royal relationships - said a daughter would be given the name Elizabeth Diana Windsor. Scroll down for video . Decision: Prince William and Kate have spent hours discussing what to call their new child. They are pictured here in July 2013 with Prince George hours after his birth at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London . Parents: Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales with baby Prince William in June 1982 . Mr Morton told The Sun on Sunday reporter Ben Griffiths: ‘Close friends to William and Kate have told me that if it is a girl they want to name the baby after Diana. ‘They discussed girls' names before George was born and now they’re hoping the next one is a girl so they can carry out their wish to honour William’s mother. They’re not too thrilled at the thought it will be shortened to Princess Di. But it won’t change their minds.’ Mr Morton added that the couple had to consider that many royals would be furious if the baby was christened Diana Elizabeth, due to the ‘hostility’ between Diana and the royal family. In November 2010, William famously gave Kate the engagement ring that once belonged to Diana, saying it was ‘my way of making sure my mother didn't miss out on today and the excitement’. Following Mr Morton's claims today, Elizabeth became 10/1 favourite for the name with MailOnline's betting partner Coral. James is second at 11/1, Victoria third at 12/1 and Alexandra fourth at 14/1.

The couple are choosing to base their family in Norfolk, but the new baby will be delivered at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, central London, where Prince George was born in July 2013. Mr Morton, 60, wrote international bestseller Diana: Her True Story in 1992 and a revised edition after her death based on taped responses from Diana to his written questions. Those recordings, about seven hours of taped responses, were secretly made in Kensington Palace in 1991 during a series of interviews conducted through an intermediary. In the tapes, the princess talks openly about her life before marrying Prince Charles, her long battle with bulimia, her suicide attempts, the heartache over her husband's long affair with Camilla Parker Bowles and her strained relationships with other members of the Royal family.","Prince William and Kate 'spent hours discussing what to call new child'

"'Law & Order SVU' is tackling racial profiling head on in an upcoming episode that winds together the controversial Trayvon Martin case and the Paula Deen scandal. In the episode, Cybill Shepard plays Jolene Castille, a famous southern chef. But instead of making a racial slur, like Deen, she guns down an unarmed, hoodie-wearing black teen she thought was following her on the Upper West Side, mirroring the Trayvon Martin slaying. According to TV Guide, Castille claims she killed the teen in an act of self-defense because she knew police were chasing a rapist of the same description. On set: Cybill Shepard, left, plays a character modeled on Paula Deen and George Zimmerman in an upcoming SUV starring Mariska Hargita . The episode, which also stars Jeffery Tambor and Leslie Odom, Jr., will air in October. On Wednesday, pictures emerged from the SVU set, sparking rumours the show was taking on the George Zimmerman trial. And Executive Producer Warren Leight confirmed it to Entertainment Weekly. '(Jeffrey) Tambor is a defense attorney representing a very high-profile celebrity woman chef who thought she was being pursued by a rapist and turned around it was a teenager. And she shot him,' he said. Odom will play a minister of the slain child. Inspiration: The tragic case of Florida teen Trayvon Martin, who was fatally shot by a self-appointed neighborhood watch rep George Zimmerman, inspired the episode . Deen: Emmy nominee Cybill Shepard, left, plays Jolene Castille, a famous southern chef inspired by Paula Deen . Leight told the magazine the episode will also deal with New York's stop-and-frisk policy. He said the show would ask the tough questions. 'Is racial profiling justifiable? Can self-defense involve racial profiling? We're diving right into that,' he said. 'Can that happen in New York? Absolutely.' The NBC sex-crimes drama is known for ripping plot lines straight from the headlines. Last season, an episode depicted a violent love affair between two pop stars in a story that uncannily resembled Rihanna and Chris Brown's abusive relationship. Filming: Ice-T, left, and Richard Belzer, right, film scenes of the episode on Wednesday . Protests: The filming prompted a small protest in support of Trayvon Martin, right . Leight said this season will feature more real crimes than usual because 'it's almost like we've been bombarded with headlines.' He added that the Zimmerman trial, reflected in the script, was so polarising it even divided the SVU team. 'When the script was published it became a litmus test for everybody here,' he said. 'It was really interesting to see people read that script and have different interpretations about who did what and whether or not they deserved prison for it. It was fascinating.'","Cybill Shepard plays Jolene Castille, a famous southern chef who guns down an unarmed, hoodie-wearing black teen in New York .

"'Sit down,' President Barack Obama begged – not 'get out' – after two Hispanic hecklers interrupted his economic speech on Thursday with shouts about illegal immigration. Then, for the first time in his presidency, the Secret Service stood down and Obama promised to meet with them before he left. 'I’m sorry, what are you yelling about now?' Obama said amid the sudden yelling. 'Sit down, guys. I’m almost done.' 'Come on, sit down. I’ll talk . to you afterwards, I promise. I’ll bring you back. I’m wrapping . things up here.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Obama spoke to a cheering, partisan crowd on Thursday in Austin, Texas, begging immigration protesters at one point to meet with him privately instead of interrupting his remarks . More than 200 miles from the Mexican border, Obama tried to quiet concerns about the tragic influx of children pouring into the U.S. without adults to watch over them . The White House's transcript of his remarks in the liberal enclave of Austin, Texas omits what the protesters said, but Obama replied, 'I understand. See, everybody is going to . start – I’m on your side, man. Sit down, guys, we’ll talk about it . later, I promise.' Before returning to his teleprompter, the president told his security force to take a step back. 'You . don’t have to escort them out,' he ordered. 'They’ll sit down.' And then, again directed at his hecklers: 'I promise I’ll . talk to you afterwards.' Obama had just wrapped up a section of his speech, partially cribbed from earlier fundraising addresses, in which he ripped into Republicans for slow-walking his demands for immigration reform measures. 'On immigration . issues,' he said, 'we’ve got – and to their credit, there are some Republicans in the . Senate who actually worked with Democrats, passed a bill [that] would strengthen the . borders, would help make the system more fair and more just.' 'But the . House Republicans, they haven’t even called the bill. They won’t even . take a vote on the bill. They don’t have enough energy or organization or . I-don’t-know-what to just even vote ""no"" on the bill.' 'Ronald Reagan passed immigration reform, and you love Ronald Reagan,' he vented at the GOP. 'Let’s go ahead and do it.' According to a White House press pool report, White House staff escorted the protesters behind the stage immediately after the president's speech was over and he 'began glad-handing with folks in front.' 'The presumption is [that] they briefly spoke to' Obama, the pool reporter wrote, 'but we moved so quickly in [the] motorcade that it couldn't have been for long.' While Obama pressed the flesh following his speech, White House staffers escorted the hecklers backstage to meet with him . BBQ to go: After the speech, senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer (L) and traveling aide Bobby Schmuck carried Obama's food orders from Franklin Barbecue onto Air Force One in Austin . Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion in supplemental funding, half of which he has said would help Customs and Border Patrol deal with the humanitarian crisis of thousands of unaccompanied children entering the U.S. illegally every week. Only about 3 per cent, however, would be dedicated to strengthening America's southwest border with Mexico. Obama has resisted calls for him to see the crisis up close, saying he has no plan to visit the border. He has, however, demanded a larger, more permanent overhaul of U.S. immigration law that would give most otherwise law-abiding illegal aliens a path to legal status – and, for some, a path to citizenship. Obama began that process in 2012 with a move to halt deportations of people brought to the United States illegally as children before July 2007. He denied on Wednesday that the sudden policy shift is responsible for a deluge of children migrating from Central America and crossing into Texas and Arizona.","President begged protesters to sit down and promised to hear them out after his speech .

"Mini-Frankenstein: The researchers have resurrected a 500-million-year-old gene and inserted it into a modern E Coli bacteria . A 500 million-year-old bacteria has been brought back to life in a laboratory at Georgia Tech in an experiment with echoes of Jurassic Park's disastrous recreation of the dinosaurs. The researchers have resurrected a 500-million-year-old gene and inserted it into a modern E Coli bacteria. The 'Frankenstein' germ has thrived. In the lab, the creation has now lived through 1,000 generations. The scientists hope to find out whether the 'ancient' bacteria will evolve the same way it did 'first time round' - or whether it will evolve into a different, new organism. ‘This is as close as we can get to rewinding and replaying the molecular tape of life,’ said scientist Betül Kaçar, a NASA astrobiology postdoctoral fellow in Georgia Tech. The new 'chimeric' bacteria has mutated rapidly - and some have become stronger and healthier than today's germs. ‘The ability to observe an ancient gene in a modern organism as it evolves within a modern cell allows us to see whether the evolutionary trajectory once taken will repeat itself or whether a life will adapt following a different path.’‘The altered organism wasn’t as healthy or fit as its modern-day version, at least initially,’ said Gaucher, ‘and this created a perfect scenario that would allow the altered organism to adapt and become more fit as it accumulated mutations with each passing day.’The growth rate eventually increased and, after the first 500 generations, the scientists sequenced the genomes of all eight lineages to determine how the bacteria adapted. New life: The bacteria with the ancient genes have thrived, and are now in their 1000th generation . ¿The altered organism wasn¿t as healthy or fit as its modern-day version, at least initially,¿ said Gaucher, ¿and this created a perfect scenario that would allow the altered organism to adapt and become more fit as it accumulated mutations with each passing day.¿ . The experiment has echoes of Stephen Spielberg's Jurassic Park, where scientists recreated dinosaurs using ancient DNA . Not only did the fitness levels increase to nearly modern-day levels, but also some of the altered lineages actually became healthier than their modern counterpart.When the researchers looked closer, they noticed that every EF-Tu gene did not accumulate mutations. Instead, the modern proteins that interact with the ancient EF-Tu inside of the bacteria had mutated and these mutations were responsible for the rapid adaptation that increased the bacteria’s fitness. In short, the ancient gene has not yet mutated to become more similar to its modern form, but rather, the bacteria found a new evolutionary trajectory to adapt.These results were presented at the recent NASA International Astrobiology Science Conference. The scientists will continue to study new generations, waiting to see if the protein will follow its historical path or whether it will adopt via a novel path altogether.‘We think that this process will allow us to address several longstanding questions in evolutionary and molecular biology,’ said Kaçar. ‘Among them, we want to know if an organism’s history limits its future and if evolution always leads to a single, defined point or whether evolution has multiple solutions to a given problem.’ The new 'chimeric' bacteria has mutated rapidly - and some have become stronger and healthier than today's germs .","'Frankenstein' germ spliced with gene from 500-million-year-old bacteria .

"A photographer has made a real meal out of a selection of classic 16th century paintings by recreating them using fruit and vegetables. New York based photographer Klaus Enrique Gerdes was inspired by Italian painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo who created real-life portraits using fruit, vegetables, meat and flowers. He then painted his creations on to canvas creating a selection of unique artworks between 1527 and 1593. Getting his five a day: A portrait of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II as the Roman God of the seasons Vertumnus by photographer Klaus Enrique Gerdes, left, and the original painted in 1590 by Italian Giuseppe Arcimboldo, right . Klaus Enrique Gerdes now does the same, except that photography allows him to capture his subject instantly - before any of the ingredients begin to wilt. Frederick, aged 98, said: ‘I had been working on a photography series in which I surround an isolated human body part with a large quantity of a certain object, when I was struck by the idea for this project. ‘While I was photographing a human eye that was peeking out amongst hundreds of leaves, it occurred to me that I could actually utilize leaves to construct portraits or masks. ‘I researched what other artists had created along these lines and discovered that, as usual, someone somewhere had already done something similar. In this case it was the artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo, who made paintings with this concept in mind over 400 years ago. Barking up the wrong tree: Klaus Enrique Gerdes's recreation of Winter, left, originally painted Giuseppe Arcimboldo in 1573, right . Delicate as a flower: A stunning image of a gentleman made entirely out of flowers and leaves now and in the past . ‘I decided to recreate Arcimboldo's work, and eventually to create my own images with his paintings as inspiration. Making each sculpture takes about three days, and is a bit of an emotional roller coaster. ‘In the beginning, I start to see everything take shape, and it is very encouraging. However, once the work gets further along and start comparing it to the original painting, I'll notice some inconsistencies. ‘Much has been said about how the subjects in Arcimboldo's paintings are proportionally correct; but every single one of those items is imaginary, and I think he stretched them beyond reality in some instances. ‘For example, in one of the paintings the nose is a small, yet perfectly shaped pear. When we were unable to find a suitable match, I decided to substitute the pear for a small sweet potato. Bowl of goodness: Klaus Enrique Gerdes's  modern take on Giuseppe Arcimboldo's The Garderner originally painted in the 16th Century . A tribute to spring: Klaus Enrique Gerdes uses a mixture of wood, vegetables, fruit and a single rose to create this portrait . ‘After I make these types of changes, little by little the sculpture starts coming together. Days later when it finally resembles Arcimboldo's original, it's incredibly rewarding. ‘Although most recognize the images immediately as portraits, there are many people who do not. ‘At first they only see the individual parts of the image: the fruits, flowers, and vegetables. But after looking at it for a while, they realize that it's a portrait of a person. ‘To see that thought process being played out in real time is very satisfying to me because it mimics the thinking behind the art: that simple organic objects come together to create something more meaningful than the sum of the parts.'

"Mitt Romney has re-emerged on the national political stage 18 months after he lost a presidential bid to President Barack Obama - and he came out swinging. Romney blasted Hillary Clinton as 'clueless' Sunday for her support of the release of five Guantanamo detainees for U.S. Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl. He also had harsh words for the Obama Administration and Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State for failing to use American power to protect the country. Scroll down for video . Still swinging: Mitt Romney pulled no punches criticizing Hillary Clinton, who he deems the most likely Democratic opponent in 2016 . Appearing on NBC's Meet the Press, Romney - who has kept a low profile since losing the 2012 Presidential election to Obama - said: 'This administration, from Secretary Clinton to President Obama, has repeatedly underestimated the threats that are faced by America. 'It has repeatedly underestimated our adversaries. And whether that's Russia or (Syrian President Bashar) Assad or ISIS or al-Qaida itself, it has not taken the action necessary to prevent things from happening. We have not used our influence to do what's necessary to protect our interests.' While Romney pounded Obama with criticism, he reserved most of his harsh words for Clinton - who is widely thought to be the front-runner for the 2016 Presidential election. 'I believe the playbook is to look at her record. I think you have to consider what's happened around the world when she was Secretary of State. And it's been a monumental bust. 'And then her most recent comments... she was asked whether the Bowe Bergdahl trade was one that presented a threat to the United States. And she came back with a clueless answer. She was clueless. Hillary Clinton, pictured last week, was blasted for her comments while on tour promoting her book, Hard Choices: A Memoir . 'She said, ""Look, these commandos don't represent a threat to the United States."" Well, of course they do. And then she went on to say, ""They only represent a threat to Afghanistan and Pakistan."" Are you kidding? I mean, we're in Afghanistan. And we're in Afghanistan in part to protect America's security. 'I think her clueless comments about the Bergdahl exchange as well as her record as the secretary of state are really going to be the foundation of how a Republican candidate is able to take back the White House.' Romney spoke from Park City, Utah, where he hosted a Republican fundraiser attended by a slew of 2016 heavy hitters, including New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Ohio Senator Rob Portman, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Romney's former running mate, Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan. Despite this, he roundly dismissed any suggestion he planned to run for president a third time.","Mitt Romney appeared on NBC's Meet the Press to criticize the Obama Administration and Hillary Clinton .

"For 15 years she has proudly served her country as a Royal Navy engineer, risking her life in Afghanistan when she fought against the Taliban. But far from showing Nicky Howse the respect she deserved as she flew back to her latest posting, Virgin Atlantic staff chose to humiliate her – by demanding that she remove her uniform because it was ‘offensive’. They warned the 32-year-old helicopter technician she would not be allowed to fly unless she took off her combat fatigues and wore a sleep suit instead. Scroll down for video . Disrespectful: Royal Navy engineer Nicky Howse, 32, was told she would have to remove her uniform if she wanted to board a flight in case it offended other passengers . Petty Officer Howse was waiting for her return flight to Los Angeles from Heathrow on Monday when the incident happened . Petty Officer Howse is on a three-month deployment with a helicopter unit in the US, but had been home on compassionate leave to attend her grandfather’s funeral. She had worn her uniform without any problems on a Virgin flight from America to Britain the week before. The incident happened as she waited for her return flight to Los Angeles from Heathrow on Monday. She was confronted by a G4S security guard and Virgin Atlantic staff, who ordered her to change into pyjamas before boarding the jet. They told her – wrongly – that it was the company’s policy not to allow military personnel to travel in uniform. In emails sent to a civilian friend, . Petty Officer Howse, from Ipswich, Suffolk, said: ‘It was horrific. I . was made to feel uncomfortable in my own country for wearing the uniform . I wear to defend the place. It made me ashamed of my country that a . British serviceman can’t travel in uniform. I was so distressed.’ The Royal Navy engineer was forced to change into a Virgin Atlantic sleep suit for the duration of the flight . She told her friend: ‘It started at check-in. Some G4S security guy gave me the third degree about travelling in uniform. I was fuming. He was rude, he wouldn’t let the check-in girl give me my passport. ‘I was shaking with rage. I thought it was all done. But when I got to the departure gate I was taken to the side by the flight supervisor and they said I wasn’t allowed to fly in uniform and had to wear a sleep suit. I then stood feeling completely humiliated with other passengers, clearly curious as to what was going on, staring at me, waiting for him to come back with the black pyjamas. ‘I asked if it was Virgin policy, they said “Yes”. I refused to wear it until after I was on board then still refused but basically got told I’d be asked to leave the flight if I didn’t take it off or cover it up.’ She told her friend: ‘I was basically told it was because “We don’t only fly British passengers” and told it was seen as a threat. I went ballistic. I said “In the country I defend I can’t wear my uniform?” ‘They then said it was for my own safety to stop abuse to which I replied I can deal with that myself if it arises as I did in Afghanistan. ‘Honestly, I was gobsmacked and horrified. I was so distressed, particularly since the whole reason I was travelling was for a funeral. ‘To clarify, a British airline who claims to be Britain’s flag carrier won’t allow a member of Britain’s armed forces to travel on their airline in uniform.’ Armed Forces rules state that a serviceman or woman can wear their uniforms voluntarily from their ‘residence to place of duty, irrespective of whether they travel by public or private transport, or on foot.’ Colonel Richard Kemp, who led British forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘This is an insult to the Royal Navy and to the British armed forces who the Queen’s uniform represents. ‘This naval engineer has volunteered to serve and to fight for her country. How dare Virgin Atlantic and G4S treat her like dirt?’ Tory MP Patrick Mercer, a former infantry officer, said: ‘Our soldiers, sailors and airmen risk their lives so that firms like Virgin Atlantic can operate and make money. ‘It is nothing short of disgraceful that they don’t receive the proper respect due to their uniform.’ A Virgin Atlantic spokesman said it did not have a policy against passengers travelling in uniform.  He added: ‘This was a completely isolated case in which our staff were incorrectly advised by a security agent … We have made contact with the passenger in question to express our deep regret for any upset caused.’ G4S declined to comment, claiming it had not received a complaint.","Nicky Howse was ordered to remove her uniform before boarding a flight .

"A schoolboy is believed to have killed himself after being accused of raping a girl when he told police about drug dealers in his town. Tom Acton, 16, became the victim of cruel taunts and was attacked by Thomas Greenwood, 18, when the lies started spreading in Poynton, Cheshire. He was due to give evidence at Greenwood's trial but was found critically ill at home days before the court hearing at Crewe Magistrates' Court. Tom was attacked in the street, targeted . on Facebook and angry youths turned up at his house as lies spread that . he had tied a girl to a tree and raped her. Death: Tom Acton (left), 16, gave information to police about people dealing drugs to youngsters. Days after his death he was due to testify in court against one of his tormentors, 18-year-old Thomas Greenwood (right) Before he was attacked, Tom moved to Wales briefly to live with his grandmother for his own safety, but was set upon by Greenwood - who can be named after a judge lifted reporting restrictions - who told him 'you are dead. It said: 'He threatened to break my . nose and said: ""If I see you, you are dead"". I screamed for my life and I . saw him just staring me out. I thought my life was going to end.' He . added that the bullying campaign by Greenwood's friends then increased. 'He started rumours that I'd raped girls', he said. 'It boils down to . the fact that I got on better with girls and he didn't like it. 'There . were rumours that I had tied a girl to a tree, raped her and took . pictures. As you can imagine I can no longer walk down the street as . everyone calls me a rapist. 'I . felt so scared for my life I wanted to break down and cry. I was scared . to go out of the house.

She said: 'The first time I knew about . it was when I had to peel Tom off the floor after he had his head . smashed against the wall. The rumour went all over the place and on . Facebook and Tom went to live with his gran in Wales for a bit. 'Tom became a recluse in his own house. It was horrific. He was screaming and crying asking why were they doing it' Gaynor Acton, Tom's mother . 'Straightaway . I called the school and police but they said there was nothing they . could do about it. They said it was just a rumour and that Facebook is . their bane. 'Tom became a recluse in his own house. It was horrific. He was screaming and crying asking why were they doing it.' She also described how he would have . to be dropped off at school even though it was just a 10-minute walk and . how a gang of 30 came to the door saying they wanted 'to get rid of the . vermin'. Speaking . at a parish council meeting, she said: 'My son Tom died in . tragic circumstances at home. 'What you won't know is that he had given . information to police about drug dealers in Poynton. 'He . was bullied, pressured and then threatened. Poynton was not a safe . place for Tom. We tried to take the issue to the authorities but were . not taken seriously. I came to the council in April for help and you did . nothing.' Claims: False rumours began circulating around Poynton (file picture) and on Facebook that wrongly alleged Tom had tied a girl to a tree before sexually assaulted her . Investigation: Tests are being conducted to establish Tom's cause of death. The teenager died on October 31 . Crewe . Magistrates' Court heard that Tom was attacked outside his home by . Greenwood in June. His statement was read to the court in which he . described how Greenwood held what he thought was a knife to his throat. A text conversation between him and a . girl read: 'I have been after him for ages. I pulled up in the car got . out, banged his head against the wall and then hit him in the face a few . times.' 'I can no longer walk down the . street as everyone calls me a rapist. I felt so scared for my life I . wanted to break down and cry. I was scared to go out of the house' Tom Acton . In court he denied making death threats and claimed not to know about the false rape allegations. Yesterday, Mrs Acton said: 'I want people suffering what Tom suffered to have the confidence to speak out. 'Ours . is a middle-class area and is supposed to be safer than safe yet I . believe that means the community is too frightened to speak out when . something goes wrong. 'It's . not the image those in authority in Poynton want to portray. When Tom . died we had over 200 cards with everyone saying what a good friend he . was and how he would help everyone - but no one was there to help him in . his darkest hours. Education: Tom attended Poynton High School (file picture) and was described as a talented footballer . 'He . would always fight and had a strong sense of justice, and if somebody . was being bullied he would always be the first one there to help them. But at the time he was very worried about the trial of Thomas Greenwood . and he said it would be the end of him. Local area: Tests are being conducted to establish his cause of death but there are no suspicious circumstances . 'He . was very apprehensive about going to court and frightened that he might . be threatened. If he did see the bullies they would make gestures . across the neck. 'They were . like a pack of wolves hounding a wounded animal. Tom was very brave, he . was even an organ donor at the age of eight after he had seen a donor . card in mine and his dad's wallets. 'I . didn't know until he was dying that he had signed up when he was eight . and signed up again when he was 16. Little did we know six months later . he would be giving them away.' Cheshire Constabulary Inspector Steve Griffiths told MailOnline: ‘We would like to take the opportunity to offer our condolences to the family following the tragic death of Tom. ‘Macclesfield Police works closely with the school and the local council with information given about drugs being considered and acted on if appropriate. As a result of information received regarding drug dealing we had launched an investigation which is currently ongoing. ‘An allegation of assault was also made by Tom in relation to a separate issue not related to drugs and this resulted in an 18-year-being charged and he is currently going through the court process so it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage. ‘Cheshire Police takes illegal drug . activity seriously and this is reflected in on-going investigations such . as Operation Dizi which has seen a large number of drug dealers from . the Macclesfield area brought to justice. ‘This operation continues and could not . be carried out without the help of the public who give us information . about drug activity in their community. Probe: Tom - seen in December 2012 (left) and August this year (right) - is believed to have committed suicide . ‘Anyone who gives information to police . regarding any crime and feels they are being threatened are dealt with . sensitively and there are procedures in place to advise and protect . them. 'An . application by the investigating officer had been made for special . measures to support mum and Tom in relation to the assault . investigation.’ Tom is believed to have committed suicide. Tests are being conducted to establish a cause of death, but there are no suspicious circumstances. David . Waugh, headmaster at the mixed comprehensive Poynton High School, said: 'We have been stunned by . the loss of a member of our community and continue to express our . deepest sympathy. 'We . continue to provide the highest of educational standards in every aspect . of our school life, within a framework of outstanding care, guidance . and support.

While the soon to be ex-Mrs Zimmerman  supported her husband during the trial last year, the two separated just two months after the July 2013 acquittal when he left her and started seeing someone new. According to the financial affidavit Zimmerman filed last month, he only has $650 in his bank account, and $14,000 in assets which is mainly his 2008 Honda pickup. Brother Robert Zimmerman Jr says he doesn't have a home, but rather moves around sleeping at the homes of friends a supporters. Free man: Last year, Zimmerman (left) was acquitted for shooting Martin (right), who he saw wandering around his neighborhood . Despite that, Zimmerman manages to spend more than $3,000 a month, with $100 each month on vacations and another $200 to psychological counseling. He spends an estimated $350 a month on medical care. That kind of spending is shocking since Zimmerman claims he is $2.5million in debt, most of which is owed to defense attorneys Mark O'Mara and Don West. A legal defense fund that raised over $400,000 has a balance of just $300 today. It's unclear how Zimmerman continues to fund his lifestyle, as the affidavit says he has no current income. He did sell a painting last December on eBay for $100,000 but the document didn't say where that money went. All that remains: One of the only assets Zimmerman has left is his pickup truck, shown getting pulled over after his acquittal for a speeding .","According to court documents filed in his divorce, George Zimmerman is broke, unemployed and homeless .

"Mugshots don't often appear to bring out your best side, and unless you're blessed with model-like looks, odds are your picture will be an ugly one. Alan Dale Lee, 45, first came to the . attention of officers in Florida when he was arrested for alleged . aggravated battery and selling of marijuana in August 2009. Nicknamed by police ‘Dracula’ for his unsightly buck teeth, these series of mug shots have drawn horror from the public because of his strange and crooked teeth. Crooked crook: Alan Lee Dale was arrested in 2009 for alleged aggravated battery and sale of marijuana . His face shows the damage caused by using methamphetamine over the years. The gap-toothed 45-year-old came under . the gaze of the law again just over a year later, in October 2010, when . he was arrested for alleged sale and possession of marijuana. His face may be older but his distinctly crooked teeth remain the same. Undeterred by his embarrassing mugshots, Lee was back in the spotlight again in 2012 on another drugs charge. He was most recently arrested by Florida’s Dade City Police Department for alleged possession of methamphetamine. Lee's startling image is not the first police mugshot to provoke jokes and titters from the general public. Other alleged criminals have been mocked for their odd expressions, bad skin, bizarre tattoos and bedraggled appearances. From a man caught wearing a woman's wig to a man with a chin so large he was unable to escape police.

The ice blue-eyed, strong-jawed likeness of Jeremy Meeks was quickly plastered across Twitter as thousands of social media users have themselves been arrested...by the 30-year-old's undeniable good looks. Meeks, already a convicted felon, was hauled in as part of a gang police sweep, but he's the one sweeping internet denizens off their feet. Stealing hearts: Jeremy Meeks, 30, was arrested in a gang raid by Stockton, California police on Wednesday. His arresting mugshot was subsequently posted to the police department's Facebook page and in fewer than 24 hours gained over 20,000 likes and received nearly six thousand comments and counting . The police puns continue on the Stockton Police Facebook page, where the photo had an unbelievable 5,800 comments by Thursday evening. Most comments stuck to the obvious jokes:' What is he guilty of?! First Degree Sexiness?!' wrote Ashley Pruitt Carden. Others, like Rhonda Cee, saw a moneymaking opportunity. 'He'll probably be on next years prison calendar...Mr....EVERY MONTH!' she wrote. By far, one of the most thing to post was a comment about Meeks having missed his calling as a model. 'He needs to be a model,' wrote Bettina Jones. 'I would buy whatever he's selling!' Meeks was charged with illegally possessing firearms and ammo, carrying a loaded firearm in public and criminal street gang activity, reports TMZ. The repeat offender is being held on $900,000 bail, but perhaps not for long. There's talk amongst the commenters of raising the funds to set him free. 'He didn't know any different.

"U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan (pictured) has performed her first same-sex wedding . U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan has performed her first same-sex wedding, it was today revealed. The 54-year-old justice presided over the wedding of former law clerk Mitchell Reich and his partner Patrick Pearsall in the Washington suburb of Chevy Chase, Maryland, yesterday. It was the first ceremony for a gay or lesbian couple at which Kagan officiated, Supreme Court spokesman Kathy Arberg confirmed. But she is not the first ever Supreme Court to have done so - with retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg both having previously performed same-sex weddings. Ginsburg most recently officiated at the wedding of Washington theater director Molly Smith, who married her longtime partner, Suzanne Blue Star Boy, on September 14. The couple, who met in Alaska, reportedly wed in a ceremony in Arena's Kogod Cradle in front of around 180 guests, including actress Erin Davie and performer Nicholas Rodriguez. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court formally added gay marriage cases to the justices' agenda for their closed-door conference on September 29. The action does not mean that the court will decide that day to hear state appeals of lower court rulings that struck down bans on same-sex marriage. However, it will be the first time the justices have the issue before them. Appeals have been filed from Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin, while the gay couples who won in each case in the lower courts also favor Supreme Court review. The justices could put off deciding whether same-sex couples nationwide have the right to marry under the Constitution until January and still be able to issue a decision by late June. Justice: The 54-year-old (seen waving after receiving an honorary doctorate degree from New York University in May) presided over the wedding of former law clerk Mitchell Reich and his partner Patrick Pearsall . On the agenda: Earlier this month, the Supreme Court formally added gay marriage cases to the justices' agenda for their closed-door conference on September 29 (file picture) Last week, Justice Ginsburg dropped some hints about the Supreme Court's plan of action on the issue of gay marriage. She said people should pay close attention to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as an indicator for when the Supreme Court will address marriage equality. Speaking at the University of Minnesota Law School, she said 'there will be some urgency' if that appeals court allows same-sex marriage bans to stand. Justice Kagan is not the first ever Supreme Court to have officiated at the wedding of a gay or lesbian couple - with retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (right) and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (left) both having done so . Such a decision would run contrary to a legal trend favoring gay marriage and force the Supreme Court to step in sooner, she predicted. But she added that if the appeals panel falls in line with other rulings, there will be 'no need for us to rush.' In America, same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia.","Justice Elena Kagan officiated at wedding of Mitchell Reich and his partner .

"With her husband still recuperating after his recent abdominal surgery, the Queen had to rely on the company of her faithful canine companions when she arrived in Scotland on holiday today. Dressed in a pink raincoat and familiar flowered headscarf, the monarch  flew up from London to Aberdeen in a private jet to begin her two-month Highland break at Balmoral Castle. This year, however, she will spend the first few weeks of her holiday alone as her 92-year-old husband is still recuperating from recent abdominal surgery. The Queen touched down at Aberdeen Airport this afternoon wearing a pink outfit . She arrived without Prince Philip who is still recuperating at Sandringham following abdominal surgery . After spending several weeks with his . wife at Windsor Castle, the 92-year-old has now moved to Sandringham, . the Queen’s private Norfolk estate, where he continues to recover. Doctors . have given him the all-clear to join the monarch but he will make his . own way up in mid-August, palace sources have revealed. ‘The Duke of Edinburgh plans to join the Queen in Balmoral in August,’ they said. Although . the Queen’s 50,000 acre private estate is remote, medics are clearly . confident that if the doughty duke does feel poorly, he can still be . swiftly treated. Indeed, . last August Philip was admitted to the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for . treatment of his recurring bladder infection after falling ill at the . royal residence. Sources also confirmed that he still hoped to resume some ‘light duties’, including public engagements, later in the autumn. Philip’s . decision to move to Sandringham alone for the time being, however, . will, inevitably, spark further fears for his health. However, she was not alone as this picture shows - one of her staff carries a corgi down the steps off the plane and onto the tarmac . The corgis travel with Her Majesty to all her residences and she tries to look after them herself as much as possible given her busy schedule . He was admitted to The London Clinic last month – his fourth hospital stay in just 18 months – for an ‘exploratory operation following abdominal investigations’. A source said at the time: ‘The Duke underwent abdominal tests last week and was told a few days ago that he needed to have an exploratory operation. ‘He was admitted to hospital by arrangement and left quite calmly - and without any panic - after a garden party, where appeared in particularly good form.’ He was discharged 10 days later and announced he would take two months off from public duties to recuperate. Buckingham Palace have never revealed the results of his tests, citing medical confidentiality. Last year the Duke was twice hospitalised with a serious bladder infection during the Diamond Jubilee celebrations and missed a number of key events. And at Christmas in 2011, he was rushed to hospital for emergency heart surgery after suffering a blocked artery while staying at Sandringham. Doctors fitted him with a stent to relieve the problem. Philip is already the longest-serving consort in British history and the oldest serving partner of a reigning monarch. Jet-set passengers: The Queen at Aberdeen Airport on her way to Balmoral Castle, with her corgi peeking out of the window . He has already scaled back on all but his most important patronages but still carries out more than 350 engagements a year, making him one of the hardest-working members of the Royal Family. At the moment he is the only senior member of the royal family not to have met the latest addition to the royal family, baby Prince George. Philip enjoys a particularly close relationship with his grandson, Prince William – the pair often shoot together – and it is certain the new parents will want him to meet their son as soon as possible. Yesterday neither Buckingham or Kensington Palaces could suggest when that might be, however.‘It is a private matter,’ they both said. But well-placed sources suggest the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge may try to see him in Norfolk before he flies up to Scotland to join his wife. Last week the Queen revealed that she was desperate for her new great-grandson to arrive before she left to go to Balmoral. Glamorous transport: The Queen and her corgis, who are used to travelling around the country with her, arrived in style by private plane . On an engagement in the Lake District, she told schoolgirl Fay Batey: ‘I would very much like it to arrive because I'm going on holiday soon.’ Fortunately he arrived on Monday and she was able to spend 30 minutes with him at Kensington Palace on Wednesday morning. As always with the Queen, her beloved dogs went with her too - and could be seen being carried off the plane by her servants. At present the sovereign owns two Corgis: Willow and Holly (who found instant fame when they appeared in last year’s James Bond skit filmed for the opening of the London Olympics) and two Dorgis: Candy and Vulcan. The palace website say of her pets: ‘The Queen’s corgis travel with her to the various residences, with Her Majesty looking after them herself as much as possible given her busy schedule.’","92-year-old Prince Philip is still recuperating from abdominal surgery .

"Teen pop idol sped through Miami at dangerously high speeds in a rented Lamborghini hours before he was arrested on January 23 . Justin Bieber was driving at speeds of up to 136mph on the same night he was arrested for drag racing, it has been alleged. The teen pop sensation sped through Miami Beach, Florida at dangerously high speeds in a rented Lamborghini hours before he was pulled over by police on January 23. Newly-released GPS speed readings, obtained by TMZ, claim to be Bieber's speed log for the entire night - and not just the minutes around his arrest. Scroll down for video . According to newly-released GPS readings, reportedly from Justin Bieber's rented Lamborghini on January 23, the singer was traveling at triple-digit speeds on a Miami causeway . Justin Bieber poses with a friend and his Lamborghini. He was stopped on January 23 for drag racing in the car and arrested on DUI charges . Bad week: Bieber was arrested for DUI in Miami on January 23 (pictured) after being stopped by police in a rented Lamborghini . At 1.23am, Bieber reportedly hit 108mph on the Julia Tuttle causeway in Miami Beach on his way to a nightclub - then, in under a minute, he revved the car to a speed of 136mph. The readout is highlighted in red on the log to signify that the RPMs reach the extreme end of the scale. When he arrived at Set nightclub at 2.27am, Bieber stayed for an hour and then drove away in the flashy car. The 19-year-old was later stopped shortly after 4am for allegedly doing 60mph in a residential 30mph zone. He was arrested for DUI, drag-racing and driving with an invalid licence. An earlier report by TMZ showed that after Bieber left Set, he was traveling at 44mph before he dropped to a speed of 27mph two minutes later. The website claim that the significance . behind the figures is that the 27mph reading came on the 3700 block of . Pine Tree Drive - where the speed limit is 30mph - and that if Bieber . had been drag racing at that point, the reading would have been . significantly higher. Bieber waves from atop an SUV as he leaves the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center, in Miami the day after he was released from jail following his arrest on charges of driving under the influence, driving with an expired license and resisting arrest . Location: Police had originally claimed they caught sight of the drag race on the 2600 block of Pine Tree Drive (pictured) before Bieber was pulled over and arrested in the 4100 block . Police had originally claimed they . caught sight of the drag race on the 2600 block of the road, before . Bieber was pulled over and arrested in the 4100 block. TMZ . claim that if the GPS records are correct, the figures will cause . issues for prosecutors in the case, as it will mean that Bieber's car . was pulled over for a reason that doesn't actually exist. Regardless . of the GPS records, official toxicology reports from Bieber's arrest . show that the singer had marijuana and the active ingredient of Xanax in . his system when he was arrested on January 23. The star has pleaded not . guilty to DUI after the arrest. He is due to be arraigned on Valentine's Day. The . charges are part of a string of recent run-ins with the law. The singer and five of his entourage are also accused of assaulting a limousine . driver on December 30 after they were picked up from a nightclub. Toronto . police released a statement saying the limo driver and an unnamed . passenger had an altercation during which he was hit on the back of the . head 'several times'. The FAA is also looking into whether Bieber and his entourage were taking marijuana and interfered with the crew of a charter jet as it came from Canada to Teterboro Airport shortly before the Superbowl. The Los Angeles County Sheriff has launched an investigation to find out if Bieber egged a neighbor’s house last month, leaving $20,000 in damages. In the days following his arrest in Florida for allegedly drag-racing, a petition was started to have the Baby singer - who is a citizen of Canada - deported. Within days, the petition garnered more than 100,000 signatures. Justin Bieber performs at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas last year. He is currently at the center of several legal battles amid allegations of drug use .","Teen pop idol sped through Miami at dangerously high speeds in a rented Lamborghini hours before he was arrested on January 23 .

"When 14-year-old Katelyn Norman learned that her bone cancer was going to take her life, she drew up a list of her final wishes - a slow dance, a last kiss, a date to prom. But as her friends gathered at a venue in LaFollette, Tennessee on Tuesday night to throw the prom in her honour, Katelyn was airlifted to hospital after struggling to breathe. So classmates and relatives brought the party to her bedside instead, bringing balloons, music and her smartly-dressed date to make sure she didn't miss out on completing her bucket list. Katelyn has been fighting osteosarcoma, an aggressive bone cancer, for two years but doctors told her last week that it has spread to her heart, arteries, pelvis and spine and that there is nothing more they can do. Scroll down for video . Special day: Katelyn Norman, 14, is presented a sash by her date at her prom in hospital on Tuesday night . Dream come true: Her date presents Katelyn, who is suffering from terminal bone cancer, with a corsage . In an extraordinary show of . courage and determination, Katelyn has drawn up a . list of activities she hopes she complete before passing away. Aims on her bucket list include . having a last slow dance, learning to drive a car, getting a Marilyn . Monroe piercing, spending a day with each of her three siblings - and attending prom. Katelyn, who was in stable condition and high spirits on Tuesday night, was pictured grinning as her date bent down to her hospital bed to present her with her corsage. Outside the hospital, thousands of people lined along Highway 63 as part of a candle-lit vigil for Katelyn, who had insisted that a party continue in her absence. Celebration: Staff and family members gather for the prom, which was on Katelyn's bucket list . Party: She was supposed to attend a prom in her honour at her school on Tuesday but fell ill earlier in the day . Support: Relatives joined the party, which was a dream for Katelyn before she succumbs to the illness . Personal party: Guests tucked into drinks and cake - which was iced with the theme of the party . 'She contacted me and said prom must go . on, that's her, and you can't help but feed off that energy, that life,' Sharon Shepard, an instructor at Katelyn's school and prom coordinator, told WATE-TV. 'Once you meet her your life will never be the same, she has such an impact.' The event, which was held at The Stables in LaFollette, had been personalised for the teenager, with the theme 'Katie in the Sky with Diamonds'. Friends danced, ate and drank at the party, and posed in front of Italian landscape backdrops - a nod to Katelyn's other dream to visit Italy. The Campbell County mayor, William . Bailey, also headed to the prom - where he announced Tuesday - March 26 - . would be known as 'Katelyn Norman Day'. Loved: Other friends and community members gathered outside her bedroom window for a vigil . Joy: Katelyn, who has been credited with bringing a community together, looks at the gathering outside . Big day: Katelyn, who has bone cancer, was hospitalised earlier in the day as she struggled to breathe . 'We . wanted to try to make this day, and this time in her life, special to . her because she makes it special for people in Campbell County,' he . said. Her story has spread across social . networking sites and Kristi Buckner in North Carolina set up a . fundraising page so the family could afford to carry out Katelyn's last . wishes. 'Katelyn has touched so many people and has been an inspiration, she has brought an entire community together,' it writes. 'Will you help us fulfill her bucket list?' Katelyn's mother, Erica Nelson, said they hoped to complete as many activities as possible as she spends her last days at home. Celebration of a life: Friends and relatives still attended the original party, at Katelyn's request . Candle-lit vigil: Thousands gathered with lights along the streets to celebrate Katelyn's prom . Smiling until the end: Katelyn, now 14, was diagnosed with bone cancer in her arm in May 2011 . Healthier days: Friends and family have said that Katelyn is headstrong, upbeat and one-of-a-kind . Dreams on Katelyn's bucket list include: . A last slow dance . Learning to drive a car . A day with each sibling . Seeing Italy . A last kiss . A Marilyn Monroe piercing on her lip . Attending an Of Mice and Men concert and getting an autographed T-shirt . Riding on the back of a motorcycle . 'I just want to give her what she isn't . going to see and just try to fulfill what she wants to do. It's not . really much, but it's something to her,' she said. 'We're very grateful that they're wanting to come help Katelyn. She's . touched a lot of people.' Sharon Shepard, the school nurse at Campbell County High School, where Katelyn attends, told ABC News the teenager is unlike anyone else. '[Katelyn] . will change your life,' she said. 'You'll never be the same. She will . make an impact on you. She's a jewel. My life will never be the same. 'She's . a fighter. She's just very opinionated and very well-spoken, very . headstrong, very driven and that's what has gotten her this far.' Her best friend Brandon Huckaby, 16, added to ABC: 'She's always used her sense of humor . and her grab on others to push to make everything better for everyone. Fighting back: On Tuesday she will complete one bucket list item - going to a prom at her school . Staying positive: She has undergone transplants and chemo but the cancer has spread to her heart and spine . 'She doesn't care that she's suffering. She cares that other people are suffering and she wants to stop that.' He . said that, although he's sad about losing his friend, he knows he must . help her complete her final wishes. 'This is happening,' he said. 'I'm . getting this done.' Katelyn was diagnosed with the bone . cancer in her right arm in May 2011, after a friend punched her arm and . it went limp. X-rays revealed abnormal bone and she was found to be . suffering from cancer in her arm and nodules in the lungs. She has since undergone bone . transplants, surgeries of tissue ligaments and chemo for her lungs, but . they have failed to ward off the illness. Family: She said that her siblings, pictured, are struggling to come to terms with her illness . Upbeat: Her friends and family said she has stayed positive and confident despite her prognosis . Community: Neighbours and groups - including these bikers - have rallied around Katelyn in her last days . Doctors are uncertain exactly how long Katelyn has to live. 'She doesn't let the fact that the . doctors said she won't last very long bother her,' her friend Brandon said. 'She has an attitude . that, ""I'm Katelyn.

"Pentagon officials knew almost immediately that the attack on the U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, on 9-11-2012 was a terrorist attack and not a demonstration gone wrong, declassified documents have shown. The documents - which were obtained by Fox News and contain 450 pages of top secret testimonies about the attack - has proven the Obama administration lied about the cause of the attack for two weeks afterward, having repeatedly maintained it was sparked by a violent demonstration against an anti-Islamic movie. According to the documents, Gen. Carter Ham - who at the time was head of AFRICOM, the Defense Department combatant command with jurisdiction over Libya - said that while there was mention of the demonstrations - which started on the same day day as Benghazi but in Egypt - he and the other commanders involved were always clear that Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Attack: O'Reilly questioned Obama over the handling of the Benghazi raid, above, that took place in 2012 . Newly declassified documents prove President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton knew the Benghazi attack was an act of terrorism almost immediately despite continuing to say it was a demonstration gone awry . The documents featuring a testimony with U.S. General Carter Ham (pictured) - who who at the time was head of AFRICOM - received a call about the Benghazi attack 15 minutes after it happened and that it 'was always clear' it was a terrorist attack . That information was delivered to President Obama and his top advisers, including then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. However the government said the attack was caused out of protest of Innocence of Muslims, a controversial 14-minute video uploaded to YouTube that was seen as denigrating of the prophet Muhammad. The movie subsequently caused a breakout of violence in Egypt on September 11 that spread to other Arab and Muslim nations and caused the death of 50 people. That night, a heavily armed group of between 125 and 150 gunmen attacked the American diplomatic mission at Benghazi, killing U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and another diplomat. Then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton supported the Obama administration claims that Muslim of Innocence was believed to be cause, and chose the Accountability Review Board to conduct an 'investigation' into the attack. The investigation determined that there was no such protest in Behnghazi and that the attack was premeditated and launched by Islamist militants. Skepticism has surrounded the government's explanation of the attack, especially from the Republican party, mostly because Benghazi happened just two months before the 2012 Presidential Election. At about 9.30pm on September 11, 2012, a heavily armed group of between 125 and 150 gunmen attacked the American diplomatic mission at Benghazi (pictured) killing U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and another diplomat . However the declassification of the documents proves the Obama administration were not divulging details of the attack to the American people. Numerous aides to the president and Clinton repeatedly told the public in the weeks following the murder of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans that night - as Obama's hotly contested bid for re-election was entering its final stretch - that there was no evidence the killings were the result of a premeditated terrorist attack. According to Fox, Gen. Ham said he learned about the assault on the consulate compound within 15 minutes of its commencement, at 9:42 pm Libya time, through a call he received from the AFRICOM Command Center. 'My first call was to General Dempsey, General Dempsey's office, to say, ''Hey, I am headed down the hall. I need to see him right away'',' Ham told lawmakers on the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation on June 26 of last year. 'I told him what I knew. We immediately walked upstairs to meet with Secretary Panetta.' Ham's account of that fateful day was included in some 450 pages of testimony given by senior Pentagon officials in classified, closed-door hearings conducted last year by the Armed Services subcommittee. The testimony, given under 'Top Secret' clearance and only declassified this month, presents a rare glimpse into how information during a crisis travels at the top echelons of America's national security apparatus, all the way up to the president. New documents obtained by Fox prove the Obama administration didn't divulge what they knew about the Benghazi consulate attack to the American people . Also among those whose secret testimony was declassified was Dempsey, the first person Ham briefed about Benghazi. Ham told lawmakers he considered it a fortuitous 'happenstance' that he was able to rope Dempsey and Panetta into one meeting, so that, as Ham put it, 'they had the basic information as they headed across for the meeting at the White House'. Ham also told lawmakers he met with Panetta and Dempsey when they returned from their 30-minute session with President Obama on September 11. Armed Services Chairman Howard 'Buck' McKeon, R-Calif., sitting in on the subcommittee's hearing with Ham last June, reserved for himself an especially sensitive line of questioning: namely, whether senior Obama administration officials, in the very earliest stages of their knowledge of Benghazi, had any reason to believe that the assault grew spontaneously out of a demonstration over an anti-Islam video produced in America. 'In your discussions with General Dempsey and Secretary Panetta,' McKeon asked, 'was there any mention of a demonstration or was all discussion about an attack?' Ham initially testified that there was some 'peripheral' discussion of this subject, but added 'at that initial meeting, we knew that a U.S. facility had been attacked and was under attack, and we knew at that point that we had two individuals, Ambassador Stevens and Mr. [Sean] Smith, unaccounted for'. Aftermath: The U.S. government said for two weeks that the attack of the American consulate in Benghazi was a protest turned violent, however new documents show that 'within minutes' of the incident they knew it was the work of terrorists . Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, a first-term lawmaker with experience as an Iraq war veteran and Army reserve officer, pressed Ham further on the point, prodding the 29-year Army veteran to admit that 'the nature of the conversation' he had with Panetta and Dempsey was that 'this was a terrorist attack'. 'As a military person, I am concerned that someone in the military would be advising that this was a demonstration. I would hope that our military leadership would be advising that this was a terrorist attack,' Wenstrup said.

"The mother of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects could be jailed if she returns to the U.S. to see her hospitalized son, it has been revealed. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, who now lives in Dagestan, Russia, is the mother of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who police say detonated two pressure cooker bombs near the finish line of the race, which killed three people and injured more than 200 others.

Suspects: Dzhokhar, right, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are accused of planting the Boston bombs at the historic race on April 15 . ABC News reported on Tuesday that Mrs Tsarnaeva failed to show up at a court hearing stemming from a July 2012 arrest for shoplifting. So if she returns to the U.S. to visit her hospitalized son or make burial arrangements for the other, she . could be arrested on an outstanding warrant. Busted: Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, was arrested last year after she allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothing from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store .

'The mother is in very bad shape,' Saratova said. 'She watches the video [of her dead son] and cries.' Incredible new images emerged on Tuesday which captured the dramatic gun battle between police . and the suspected Boston bombers in a residential street, leaving one brother dead. The images, taken by a resident of Watertown, Massachusetts in the early hours of Friday and posted on his blog, appear to show the Tsarnaev . brothers sheltering behind a vehicle and taking aim at police . officers. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, and his . brother Tamerlan, 26, are reportedly seen running to a car for more supplies before . hauling out a pressure cooker bomb they then detonated, filling the . street with smoke.

Threat: In another image, a red circle shows what the eyewitness believed to be a pressure cooker bomb . Taken down: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gunfight with police on April 19. Dzhokhar, who was injured, was captured that evening . The photographs, taken on the . eyewitness' phone from a third-floor bedroom overlooking the . scene, are the first images giving insight into the fraught battle that . left one brother dead. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev then jumped in the car . and barreled towards the police barricade, making a narrow escape. Authorities said that he ran over his brother Tamerlan. Their mother told Channel 4 on Tuesday that her sons had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks. She said: 'What happened is a terrible thing but I know my kids have nothing to do with this. I know it, I am mother.' The trip by the U.S. team was made . possible because of Russian government cooperation with the FBI . investigation into the bombing at the Boston Marathon. Shielded: Katherine Russell, the widow of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, leaves her lawyer's office on Tuesday . Also on Tuesday, the bombers' sister, Ailena and Bella Tsarnaev, released a statement to the media, saying that they 'don't have the answers' about their brothers' alleged crimes. The statement read: 'Our heart goes out the victims of last week's bombing. It saddens us to see so many innocent people hurt after such a callous act. 'As a family, we are absolutely devastated by the sense of loss and sorrow this has caused. 'We don't have any answers but we look forward to a thorough investigation and hope to learn more. We ask the media to respect our privacy during this difficult time.' The embassy official said he could not confirm whether the U.S. investigators had already talked to the parents. 'Naturally, the parents are not ready to meet with anyone because the grief is enormous,' Russian official Zaurbek Sadakhanov told a crowd of journalist in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan. 'They... are asking to be left alone, at least for a while, to be able to recover.

"Regret: Major Richard Streatfeild, pictured when he was made an MBE, said he misled listeners . A British Army officer whose emotional dispatches from Afghanistan moved millions of radio listeners has hit out at penny-pinching politicians who he says cost the lives of his heroic troops. Major Richard Streatfeild, whose broadcasts, dubbed The Sangin Diaries, revealed the bravery and sacrifice of soldiers from the Rifles Regiment, says that a woeful lack of equipment led to the deaths of many men. The 41-year-old former commander, who quit the Army in 2012, now says he believes his broadcasts deceived his audience because he did not highlight the fatal shortages of basic equipment. ‘By sticking to the Ministry of Defence’s line I misled the public,' he admitted last night. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, he accused the MOD of ‘criminal negligence’ for sending troops into battle without adequate protection. He also revealed how: . Streatfeild’s claims are more damning because his 140 troops from A Company, 4th Battalion, the Rifles, were sent to the most dangerous area of Helmand Province – Sangin – where more UK soldiers had died than anywhere else. Under fire: The soldiers were working in Sangin province, pictured, one of the most dangerous places on Earth . The lack of armoured vehicles meant Streatfeild’s soldiers had to cross treacherous terrain on foot. Inevitably they fell victim to enemy snipers and to improvised explosive devices (IEDs) dug into paths and roads. Five members of A Company were killed, 35 wounded. Yet while these shortages drove Streatfeild to despair, he took to the airwaves of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme to give a reassuring but misleading account of the provision of equipment. In a broadcast on Today in March 2010, Streatfeild addressed concerns about troops not having adequate equipment. He told BBC listeners: ‘I have an excellent rifle with a brand new sight, a new helmet, winter and summer kit that does the job and more.’ Last night, a contrite Streatfeild said: ‘It is the equipment broadcast that really sticks in my gullet. I avoided all the contentious life or death issues which I knew about at the time. 'Reading the transcript now I feel a real sense of shame. By sticking to the MOD’s line I misled the public about the equipment crisis gripping the soldiers in Afghanistan at the time. ‘I regret giving the impression that everything was essentially OK, a sanitised version of the ground truth. Claims: Major Streatfeild said there were not enough armoured vehicles, which the MoD denied . 'The lack of radios, armoured vehicles and bomb detection devices, which should have been made available for training purposes, cost soldiers’ lives, as did a shortage of transport helicopters. 'In at least ten examples of my troops being wounded or killed I regard the MOD as being criminally negligent. ‘For example from October to December 2009 my soldiers had no armoured or mine-resistant vehicles to use in Sangin, the most dangerous place in the world. 'We only had half the Bowman radios we required and most soldiers only had personal radios, which worked over a range of 1,300ft.' Streatfeild’s concerns about kit first surfaced in pre-deployment training, when soldiers are supposed to practice using the life-saving equipment they will rely on in the warzone. ‘From October to December . 2009 my soldiers had no armoured or mine-resistant vehicles to use in . Sangin, the most dangerous place in the world. We . only had half the Bowman radios we required and most soldiers only had . personal radios, which worked over a range of 1,300ft.' - Major Richard Streatfeild . His troops required 35 mine detectors to meet the warzone ratio of one detector for every four soldiers, but got just three. This shortage led troops to simulate carrying a detector by waving broomsticks, wafting their arms about and making beeping noises. In another incident, the accidental shooting of Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard by another British soldier showed the danger of not having enough radios. Colleagues mistook LCpl Pritchard for an insurgent and, without a proper radio, a warning message could not be sent. Last night, Streatfeild described how he seethed as he listened to the evidence at Pritchard’s inquest given by a colonel who was the MOD’s expert witness on target identification. Colonel Stephen Cartwright told the coroner that following the tragedy in December 2009 the Army had upgraded an infrared identification system carried by soldiers and was looking at introducing better, more reliable radios. Streatfeild said: ‘I was fuming. I knew that upgrade had not taken place. Colonel Cartwright’s evidence misled the coroner and LCpl Pritchard’s family.’ One in four users of the Vallon bomb detector in Sangin died, including Rifleman Martin Kinggett (pictured) ‘I have looked up the chain of command for anyone who might be big enough to accept this [responsibility for Pritchard’s death]. I don’t any more. ‘The generals, civil servants  and politicians seem to have no desire to accept the consequences of their actions or inactions.’ Last night, an MOD spokeswoman said: ‘We strongly dispute these claims and can confirm the comments made by Colonel Cartwright at the inquest. ‘At that time we had upgraded infra-red identification equipment and were in the process of procuring further new equipment to help ensure a similar incident could not happen again.’ Streatfeild has written a book attacking the MOD over equipment failures and tactics used against the Taliban. ‘Honourable Warriors’ will be serialised in The Mail on Sunday. Killed: Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard was 22 . Streatfeild says: ‘On the night of Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard’s death, the section commander’s radio stopped working and none of the soldiers on Pritchard’s patrol had a back-up radio capable of sending a message to the British sniper before he fired the fatal shot which killed Pritch. 'He thought he was shooting at Taliban fighters who appeared to preparing a roadside explosive device 2,500ft away. ‘Actually he was shooting at his own men – Pritch and another soldier who survived the incident.’ At an inquest, a coroner blamed military ‘failures’  for Pritchard’s death. ‘To use a bomb detector effectively when you’re under enemy fire takes hundreds of hours of practice,’ Streatfeild says. Due to kit shortages only three devices, known as Vallons, were available to his 140 men to train on before they deployed to Afghanistan. He adds: ‘So my soldiers had less time to use the equipment. Waving a stick was no substitute for practising with a bomb detector.’ In Sangin, one in four Vallon operators, including rifleman Martin Kinggett, were killed or seriously injured. ‘I sent 25 soldiers on driving courses so they could use the Mastiff, an armoured vehicle which provides protection against mines,’ says Streatfeild. ‘When we got to Sangin there was not one armoured or mine-proof vehicle in our base. We were furious and felt bitterly let down, having been told that we would be able to use Mastiffs. This was a disgrace – these vehicles would have saved lives. So for months we walked everywhere and were very vulnerable.’","Major Richard Streatfeild, 41, made the claims after quitting Army in 2012 .
He accuses MoD of 'criminal negligence' for leaving troops unprepared .
He says lack of bomb detectors, radios and armoured vehicles cost lives .
Hundreds of soldiers were sent to the most dangerous area of Helmand Province without a single armoured or mine-resistant vehicle, and with half the quantity of radios they required.
Troops who would have to search for deadly Taliban mines using metal detectors had to train using broomsticks, leaving them woefully ill-prepared when on the frontline. One in four soldiers using the detectors were killed or suffered terrible injuries.
He fumed with anger as he watched a Whitehall mandarin tell an inquest into the death of one of his soldiers that kit problems had been solved.
A quota system for gallantry medals meant top brass who were miles from the frontline won awards, while junior soldiers involved in fierce fighting against the Taliban lost out."

"An elderly woman died alone after doctors failed to tell relatives they were ending her life on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway. Olive Goom, 85, passed away with no one by her side after medics neglected to consult with her family about her treatment at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Last night MPs, including Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham, called for an urgent review into the way the pathway operates. Olive Goom, aged 81, just before she went into the care home. She died at 85 with no one at her side after doctors put her on the Liverpool Care Pathway . Chris Skidmore, a member of the influential Commons health select committee, said: 'These cases are disturbing, and if families have not been kept informed, that is wrong. It undermines the mutual bonds of trust which are essential in the NHS. We need an investigation into this breakdown of trust.' As Miss Goom lay dying alone, staff reassured relatives on the phone just hours before her death that there was no urgent need to visit – even though doctors had already removed tubes providing vital food and fluids. Her family discovered that she had died only when her niece went to visit her and found she was already being prepared for the mortuary. They said last night that they will never be able to stop feeling guilty that no one was there in her final hours. The Mail has been contacted by several families who claim that relatives were put on the Liverpool Care Pathway – the controversial system designed to ease the suffering of the dying in their final hours – without any consultation. Some said they found out that their relatives were on the pathway only after they happened to read their medical notes; and by that time it was too late. The process involves withdrawing life-saving treatment and can involve the heavy sedation of a patient and the removal of tubes providing food and fluid. Thousands of patients every year are placed on the pathway, which was devised in the 1990s as a means of easing pain when it is impossible for a patient to recover and death is imminent. Concern: Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham has called for an urgent review into the way the pathway operates . Medics at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital neglected to consult with Olive Groom's family about her treatment . However, critics say it is increasingly being applied to patients without their families' knowledge and when they still have a chance of recovery. Miss Goom's niece, Marion Hebbourne, 68, last night told how her aunt was admitted to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London after she broke her humerus bone in a residential care home in February last year. Mrs Hebbourne made the 70-mile round-trip to visit from her home near High Wycombe on several occasions during Miss Goom's stay in hospital. But she had no idea that her aunt, who never married and had worked as a seamstress, was about to die on the pathway and had in fact been trying to find her a place in a nursing home closer to where she lived. Mrs Hebbourne said: 'My aunt was not well and she had a water infection, but I would not say she was close to death. We were preparing for her being released from hospital. On the Thursday I visited her and her speech was laboured but she recognised me and did not seem near death. 'I wanted to spend the last hours and days of her life with her. They could have told me that I needed to come down and see her.' Miss Goom's niece . 'I told the staff that I was going to a wedding the next day but told them to contact me if there was any deterioration and that I'd take calls on my mobile. 'On the Saturday I rang and asked how she was and asked if I should come in, but they told me that there were no worries. On the Sunday, I picked up my cousin and we arrived at the hospital at 12.15pm, which was a bit before visiting hours started at 1pm, but we went up to the ward to ask if we could see her. 'When we got there, the nurse said, “haven't you got our phone call? We phoned you about 11.15am” and we were asked to go into the relatives' room. 'She then told us, “unfortunately your aunt has passed away”. When I said surely I should have been called, the nurse said, “you knew that she was on the Liverpool Care Pathway”. I knew absolutely nothing, they had never mentioned it.' Mrs Hebbourne added: 'I wanted to spend the last hours and days of her life with her. They could have told me that I needed to come down and see her. 'If they had talked it over with me we may have thought it was the best thing, but we were never told. I now have to live with the guilt that nobody from her family was there for her.' Last night the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital admitted that doctors had put Miss Goom on the pathway without telling Mrs Hebbourne and apologised. A spokesman said: 'We have implemented a number of recommendations to improve care for patients in the last days of life. Instead of a single tick-box for staff to confirm that relatives have been involved in discussions about end-of-life care, staff now have to specify what was discussed, when and with whom.' Mr Skidmore said he would write to the Health Secretary today to demand an investigation into the pathway, to 'restore faith' in it. Mr Burnham added: 'I have looked carefully at the Liverpool Care Pathway and I support it. It is absolutely essential that it is properly communicated and understood by the family, and done in complete partnership with them. 'I would call for a review to ensure that that happens in every instance.'","Olive Goom, 85, was put on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway .

"President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle are on the lookout for minimum-wage jobs for their teenage daughters so they can give them a feeling of what 'most folks go through every single . day.' 'We are looking for . opportunities for them to feel as if  going to work and getting a . paycheck is not always fun, not  always stimulating, not always fair,' the president said in an interview  with Parade magazine, . slated to run on Sunday. 'I . think every kid needs to get a taste of what it's like to  do that real . hard work,' Michelle echoed. Instilling good values? President Obama and his wife Michelle are on the lookout for minimum-wage jobs for their teenage daughters, for them to get a sense of what 'most folks go through every day' Both the president and the first lady worked minimum-wage jobs . before they got law  degrees: an experience they said . they also  want their teenage daughters -  Malia, 16, and Sasha, who turned 13 this month -  to share. The . president scooped ice cream at Baskin-Robbins, waited  tables at an . assisted-living facility for seniors and also  worked as a painter. The . first lady worked at a book binding  shop. It is unclear what sort of careers paths Malia and Sasha have their eyes set on beyond their destined minimum wage experiences, but Malia was recently spotted on the set of a CBS . television program, working as a production assistant for a day. Given that the president and the first lady have kept an eagle eyed watch on their daughters since they entered the White House, shielding them from public scrutiny as much as possible, it also remains unclear how they propose to land them jobs among the 'normal folk' Obama refers to. Straight talking: Obama, pictured with Malia, 16, (left) and Sasha, 13, (right), is keen for his daughters to learn that 'getting a paycheck is not always fun, not always stimulating, not always fair' Humble beginnings: Michelle (left) worked at a book binding job in her youth, while her husband scooped ice cream, waited tables, and worked as a painter . In the . interview, the Obamas also talked about how, for a year after law . school, they lived with Mrs Obama's mom, Marian  Robinson, on the second floor of her house, drove a used car that they bought for  $1,000, and worked . through the stress of being saddled with  student loans and small . children. 'Getting a . paycheck is not always fun, not  always stimulating, not always fair' They acknowledged that their careers . gave them the chance to  earn good incomes and negotiate family leave . when they needed it  - a luxury that most minimum-wage workers do not . have. 'But what it made me think about was people . who were on the  clock,' the president said. 'If you're an hourly . worker in most  companies, and you say, ""I've got to take three days . off,"" you  may lose your job. At minimum, you're losing income you can't . afford to lose.' Giving back: Earlier this year, the president took Sasha (right) with him to participate in a community service project at the D.C. Central Kitchen . The . Obamas gave the interview to promote a summit the White  House is . holding on Monday to discuss policies to help working  families. 'There . are structures that can help families around child  care, healthcare, . and schooling that make an enormous difference  in people's lives,' Obama said in the interview. This . year, the president has tried to focus on issues such as  ensuring equal pay . for women, expanding early childhood  education and hiking the minimum . wage. These issues so far have  failed to gain traction in Congress, but . do resonate with  Democratic voters. To advance . his agenda, he needs Democrats to keep control of  the Senate after . November's midterm elections and regain control of the House of . Representatives. 'If we can highlight these . issues and sustain it over the  next year, it's still possible to see . bold action out of  Congress,' Obama said. Republicans stand a good chance of taking away the Senate and are likely to keep the House. During the interview with Parade the Obama's also showed off their lighter side, and the president revealed that early in their marriage Michelle had to teach him how to do laundry. 'I wouldn’t fold,' the president said. 'I didn’t separate, and Michelle’s point was, that’s not laundry.' Cleaning the bathroom wasn't one of the president's strengths, either. 'I was usually the bill payer, the grocery shopper, and generally the dishwasher. Michelle was -usually the bathroom cleaner, just because she didn’t think I did a good enough job,' he said, laughing. 'There were certain things she just didn’t trust me to do.'","Obama once scooped ice cream and waited tables, and the first lady worked at a book binding shop .

Are you telling me that [when] I visit a detention facility, that I can't bring a cell phone with me?' the Republican asked. 'Are you saying that? ... I am not allowed to take photographs?' 'I want it fixed immediately! Understand?' McCain boomed at Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske. Scroll down for video . Angry: Arizona Republican Senator John McCain ripped into the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol commissioner on Wednesday for refusing to let members of Congress tour detention facilities with their cell phones . Defensive: CBP Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske (L) insisted that thousands of illegal immigrant children have 'a right to privacy,' even where senators are concerned . Deplorable: The photo that launched a thousand news articles: Breitbart.com obtained the first leaked photos from inside a Homeland Security holding facility where hundreds of illegal immigrant children languished in squalid conditions . The policy, called an 'Interim Protocol for Visitation and Tours,' requires all visitors to turn over their phones and restricts contact with the detained children and staff members. McCain ripped into Kerlikowske for applying the rules to him even though the Nogales, Arizona facility is in the state he represents. 'People from Arizona elected me, and I'm not supposed to even carry a cell phone with me?' he demanded. 'Mister, you have overstepped your responsibilities and your authority.' 'I want those instructions revoked, as far as members of Congress are concerned, and I want it done today.' The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, was embarrassed in June when Breitbart.com published the first leaked photos showing the inside of then-secret facilities where thousands of children were being held after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally and alone. The images showed overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, and immediately turned the flood of children into the U.S. southwest into a national controversy. Since . then, CBP has allowed Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar to take pictures . inside a facility in southern Texas. The images showed children tightly . packed in small rooms, often using sheets made of foil for warmth. No Republican lawmaker has been permitted to take such photographs. MailOnline has also published exclusive photos showing children streaming in and out of the Nogales facility. Foil blankets: Reuters got rare pictures from inside the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Nogales Placement Center, but MailOnline has learned that the photographer was shadowed by a government official who controlled what was photographed . Fate unknown: Thousands of child detainees live and sleep in crowded holding cells until a relative can be found to claim them; DHS told MailOnline that no effort is made to determine whether the adult guardians are themselves in the U.S. illegally . Secrets: This photo, taken from a security video monitor in May, shows the fate of underage Central Americans when they enter the United States . The Reuters news agency was permitted to take rare pictures inside the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Nogales Placement Center, but MailOnline has learned that the photographer was shadowed by a government official who controlled what was photographed. On Wednesday McCain also ripped into Kerlikowske for a policy that restricts 'physical or verbal contact' with children and staff at holding facilities. The commissioner offered to make 'special arrangements' but defended the policy. During a June visit to the Nogales facility, McCain was told not to speak with children or staff. 'I view that as a violation of my responsibilities,' he said. 'I want it fixed, and I want it fixed immediately.

"Gavin & Stacey star Ruth Jones has described receiving an MBE as the 'icing on the cake' of her career so far. The actress who co-created the popular comedy drama with comedian James Corden was presented with the award by the Queen during a Windsor Castle investiture ceremony. Jones, 47, who is busy filming the latest series of the Sky comedy Stella, said: 'It’s a huge honour and I feel really lucky, I love doing my job. I suppose doing the job you love is reward enough but this is like the icing on the cake. Ruth Jones with her MBE (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) for services to Entertainment, presented to her by Queen Elizabeth II at a Investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle on Friday . Ruth Jones, here receiving her honour from the Queen, described her MBE as the 'icing on the cake' of her varied career . 'It’s funny, yesterday I was on the film set as Stella, which we’re filming at the moment, and I was dressed up in my nurse’s costume, with my wig on shouting at somebody and today I’m in Windsor Castle getting an MBE - so life is very rich and varied, let’s put it that way.' The actress and writer got her first break on ITV’s diet club drama Fat Friends in 2000 where she also struck up a friendship with co-star James Corden. The pair came up with the idea for Gavin & Stacey during breaks from filming and the show, set partly in her native South Wales, became a massive hit. The award-winning comedy was a huge critical and commercial hit and made Jones, who co-wrote it and played the larger-than-life Nessa, a star. The multi-talented Jones is currently playing the title character in Stella but also co-wrote and produced the show, which is set in the South Wales valleys, with her husband, David Peet. Other roles have included playing Carry On star Hattie Jacques in a BBC biopic. Gavin & Stacey was a huge critical and commercial hit and made Jones, who co-wrote it and played the larger-than-life Nessa, a star . Ruth spoke of how surreal it was to leave the set of 'Stella' for the grandeur of Windsor castle . Jones, who was announced during the investiture by her married name Ruth Peet, said: 'It feels weird talking about Gavin & Stacey because it was such a long time ago but it was a huge part of my life, I had such a great time, I loved working with James Corden. 'But things move on, we’re on our fourth series of Stella now. (L-R) Ruth Jones, Joanna Page, Mathew Horne and James Corden, with whom she came up with the idea for Gavin & Stacey . 'I do have a laugh doing my job and I work with my husband, we have a production company, so it’s great we’re able to spend time together working. 'I am a bit of a perfectionist and I do tend to throw myself into things quite a lot - I want it to be as good as it can be.” Speaking about her brief chat with the Queen during the MBE presentation, the actress added: 'I told her that I write and perform and she said to me ‘that sounds like an immense amount of fun’.' She added, laughing: 'I have no expectation whatsoever that the Queen has ever seen an episode of Gavin & Stacey or Stella. I think we sent Prince Charles a boxset of Gavin & Stacey once, and I think William and Harry like it.'","The actress has been awarded MBE for for services to entertainment .

"'Profoundly disturbed': Angela Merkel's response to a survey showing over half of Germans want out of the euro . Angela Merkel was last night said to be ‘profoundly disturbed’ after a poll showed that a majority of Germans want to ditch the struggling euro. Sources in Berlin said the German chancellor was shocked by the evidence of growing Euroscepticism in her country, at a time when Germany is under huge pressure to bankroll a rescue of the single currency. The poll in a German newspaper found that 51 per cent of Germans think the country should return to the deutschmark. It is the first poll to show that more want to leave the euro than stay in it. Only 29 per cent thought Germany would be better off staying inside the 17-strong eurozone. The survey also found that 71 per cent of Germans now believe Greece should be booted out of the single currency unless it acts on promises to tackle its huge debts. Mrs Merkel’s spokesman said she was ‘profoundly disturbed’ by the poll results. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the Eurogroup organisation of eurozone finance ministers, last night risked further inflaming opinion in Germany by suggesting Berlin was treating the eurozone ‘as its subsidiary’ and taking decisions solely in its own national interest. ‘Why is it like this?’ he asked. Mr Juncker, who is Luxembourg’s prime minister, said there was ‘no more time to lose’ in saving the single currency – prompting fresh speculation that the European Central Bank is poised to ease the pressure on Spain and Italy by intervening in the markets to cut their borrowing costs. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, right, and President of the Euro group and Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker: Mr Juncker has criticised German politicians . Tony Blair yesterday joined the . voices urging Germany to act decisively to end the two-year euro crisis, . which is blamed for prolonging the recession in Britain. 'No room for further concessions': German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble says Greece's reforms must be carried out to the letter . He said Germany now had to accept some . form of ‘debt pooling’ across the eurozone – a move that has been . bitterly resisted in Berlin. The former prime minister said it was ‘not surprising’ that Germans are reluctant to pour more money into supporting the euro. But he insisted that continuing to . allow market confidence to drain from the euro is worse because it is . pushing up the cost of rescuing the single currency. However, the growing Euroscepticism in . Germany limits Mrs Merkel’s room for manoeuvre, particularly with . national elections due next year. Economy minister Phillipp Rosler . seized on the poll results, saying there were ‘considerable doubts about . whether Greece is living up to its reform promises’. In a sign of growing global concern . about the euro crisis, US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner flew to . Germany for talks with German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble and ECB . chief Mario Draghi yesterday.","Survey comes as expectations grow that Germany will have to play big role in bailing out Greece and Spain .

"President Barack Obama defended his decision to release five detainees from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl today, saying the country had an obligation to not leave its military personnel behind. 'Is there a possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us? Absolutely,' Obama said during today's press conference of the recently released detainees.'That's been true of all the prisoners that were released from Guantanamo. There's a certain recidivism rate that takes place.' But the president added, 'I wouldn't be doing it if I thought that it was contrary to American national security.' Scroll Down for Video . President Barack Obama defended his decision to release five detainees from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, saying today that the country had an obligation to not leave military personnel behind . Speaking at a press conference in Warsaw, Poland, Obama said his administration had consulted with Congress about the possibility of a trade 'for some time' Days after his rescue, Bergdahl (pictured in a video released by the Taliban in 2010) was in stable condition at a U.S. military hospital in Germany . Obama brushed aside questions today about how Sgt. Bergdahl -  a suspected deserter - was captured in 2009. The . Pentagon concluded in 2010 that Bergdahl walked away from his unit, . and, after an initial flurry of searching, the military curbed any . high-risk rescue plans. 'Regardless . of the circumstances, whatever those circumstances may turn out to be, . we still get an American solider back if he's held in captivity,' Obama . said. 'We don't condition that.'

Obama, center left, pictured with Poland's President Bronislaw Komorowski,center right, at Belweder Palace in Warsaw, Poland, has suggested lawmakers were aware of the prospect that the U.S. could agree to a prisoner swap with the Taliban . Obama is visiting Warsaw, Brussels, Paris and Normandy this week where he is expected to elaborate on the U.S. commitment to counter Russian moves against Ukraine . Obama (pictured with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski at a hanger at Warsaw Chopin Airport) defended how his administration handled the formal notifications, saying that when the opportunity to free Bergdahl presented itself, 'We seized that opportunity' Questions have also mounted at home over the way Bergdahl's . freedom was secured: Five high-level members of the Taliban were . released from the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and sent to . Qatar. The . five, who will have to stay in Qatar for a year before going back to . Afghanistan, include former ministers in the Taliban government, . commanders and one man who had direct ties to the late al-Qaida chief . Osama bin Laden. Republicans in Congress criticized the agreement and complained about not having been consulted about the terms of Bergdahl's release. They say that by unilaterally negotiating the terms of Bergdahl's release, the President broke a federal law that . requires him to notify members of Congress 30 days before releasing . anyone from Guantanamo Bay. Members of the House Armed Services . Committee said the Pentagon notified the panel by phone on Saturday that . the exchange was occurring in the next five hours. Obama said Tuesday that lawmakers were aware that the U.S. could agree to a prisoner swap with the Taliban 'for quite some time,' and he defended how his administration . handled the formal notifications, saying that when the opportunity to . free Bergdahl presented itself, 'We seized that opportunity.' That's not true, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said this morning after Obama's news conference. 'I don’t know what he means by consulted Congress for some time,' Rogers told MSNBC. 'In 2011, they did come up and . present a plan that included a prisoner transfer that was, in a . bipartisan way, pushed back. We hadn’t heard anything since on any . details of any prisoner exchange.' U.S. President Barack Obama is greeted by Poland's President Bronislaw Komorowski upon his arrival in Warsaw .

U.S. President Barack Obama waves alongside Poland's President Bronislaw Komorowski as he arrives at Belveder Palace in Warsaw . Officials said delaying Bergdahl's . transfer in order to comply with the congressional notification rules . would have interfered with two of the president's constitutional . authorities: protecting the lives of Americans abroad and protecting . U.S. soldiers. 'Because . such interference would significantly alter the balance between . Congress and the president, and could even raise constitutional . concerns, we believe it is fair to conclude that Congress did not intend . that the administration would be barred from taking the action it did . in these circumstances,' National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a . statement released shortly after Obama's news conference. Obama . has previously expressed concern about the congressional notification . requirement, which was passed as part of the 2014 defense bill. The Pentagon concluded in 2010 that Bergdahl walked away from his unit, and, after an initial flurry of searching, the military curbed any high-risk rescue plans . On Saturday Obama called Bergdahl's parents Jani and Bob shortly after he was secured to give them the good news. Together they officially announced the release of Bowe in the White House Rose Garden . Obama also brushed aside questions today about the circumstances surrounding Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's capture by insurgents in 2009, saying the U.S. has an obligation to not leave its military personnel behind . In a statement that accompanied his signing of that legislation, he said the executive branch must have flexibility 'to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers.' The U.S. and the Taliban negotiated the prisoner exchange indirectly, with the government of Qatar serving as an intermediary. The five Afghan prisoners are now in Qatar and are banned from travelling outside the country for a minimum of one year.

RELEASED: Mohammad Fazi is believed to have been at the command of a mass killing, and the United Nations has sought his prosecution for war crimes . Republicans have also criticised the Obama administration actions as capitulating to terrorists. Former . secretary of state Hillary Clinton however gave a measured defence . yesterday of the Obama's administration decision to swap the detainees . for Sgt. Bergdahl, noting many of America's allies make similar deals. Clinton . said she did not second-guess people who make such tough decisions and added the American tradition of caring for its citizens and soldiers . was a 'noble' one when she was asked about the exchange at an event in . Denver. 'This . young man, whatever the circumstances, was an American citizen - is an . American citizen - was serving in our military,' Clinton said. 'The idea . that you really care for your own citizens and particularly those in . uniform, I think is a very noble one.' Clinton said the most important thing will be to get as much information as possible from Bergdahl about his time in captivity, saying he could be a valuable intelligence asset and shed light on the Taliban's workings. Days after his rescue, Bergdahl, 28, is reportedly in stable condition at a U.S. military hospital in Germany. It is unknown when he will return to the U.S., but when he does, he will most likely be sent to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antoni, Texas, a Department of Defense official told CNN. 'The recovery and reintegration of Bowe Bergdahl is a work in progress,' Bergdahl's father, Bob, said on Sunday at a press conference in Boise, Idaho.'It isn't over for us. In many ways. It's just beginning for Jani, [Bowe's mother] and I, and our family. There's a long process here.' he said .","It's 'absolutely' possible the prisoners the U.S. released form Guantanamo Bay could rejoin terrorist cells, President Barack Obama said today .
But the U.S. has an obligation to not leave soldiers behind, he said .
'I wouldn't be doing it if I thought that it was contrary to American national security,' he told reporters at a press conference in Warsaw, Poland .
Obama suggested that he did not violate federal law by making the trade without congressional approval because his administration consulted with Congress 'for some time' about the possibility .
He also brushed aside questions about Bergdahl's capture by insurgents in 2009, saying the circumstances of his departure from base are irrelevant ."
"Some three-quarters-of-a-million migrants struggle to speak a word of English and are taking no steps to learn, shocking new figures have revealed. Despite ministers in successive Government pledging strict language tests as part of the immigration system, around 700,000 foreigners living here would fail to hold a cursory conversation. The startling total was exposed in a think-tank report which said learning the English language was ‘vitally important to the integration of migrants who wished to build a successful future in the UK’. Academics said migrants who were ‘non-proficient’ in English were being ‘left voiceless’. Critics said the findings risked making a mockery of repeated Government promises that any foreigner wanting to live here must be able to speak the language. The report follows a recent survey by the Office for National Statistics which revealed more than half of migrants who have failed to learn English do not have jobs – so are more likely to rely on benefits. Scroll down for video . The report said there was a 'widening gap' between the 850,000 migrants who said they could not speak English at the last census, and the 150,000 currently enrolled in classes to learn . This group were significantly less likely to be in employment than people who speak English as their first language - and the 2.9million migrants who have learnt it. The new statistics were revealed by Demos, a left-leaning think-tank, in a study published today. The report said there was a ‘widening gap’ between the 850,000 migrants who at the last census in 2011 said they could not speak English well or at all and the 150,000 currently registered in classes to learn – known as English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL). Of those who struggled to speak English, 37 per cent were from south Asia, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, and 17 per cent were from Poland. Demos said the ESOL system was ‘under strain’ because the number of working-age foreigners aged 16 to 64 who lived in Britain had risen from 3million in 1993 to 6million in 2012 – fuelled by Labour’s flawed policy of opening the country’ s doors to mass immigration. But it criticised the Coalition for reducing funding for ESOL classes by 40 per cent – from £212million in 2008-09 to £128million in 2012-13. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills funds ESOL classes at further education colleges, community colleges or through independent organisations. Ally Paget, the author of the report, said: ‘It is essential that we get as many newcomers as possible using English with confidence. This will unlock migrants' potential and benefit the whole country. ‘Unfortunately, our current ESOL system is not up to the task. Current policy suffers from fragmentation, lack of clarity about the aims and intended outcomes of learning, and the tendency to take a short-term view.’ Introduce a ‘national strategy’ on teaching English to migrants would ‘make it easier for migrants to access public services and interact in the community’, said Demos. The report into the number of people who cannot speak English comes after the Home Office was rocked by two immigration scandals. In May, the Mail revealed migrants who cannot speak English were able to buy a certificate saying they had passed a language test. The document opened the door to British citizenship, allowing them access to a full range of benefits. Scandal: Migrants who spoke no English were able to pay £500 for a certificate saying they passed . Our investigation exposed Learn Pass Succeed, which ran the scam at exam centres licensed by the Home Office. During our undercover probe, the Mail paid £500 for a pass certificate in the English language exam for a fake candidate despite him never sitting the test or taking a course. And a month later red-faced ministers admitted the staggering scale of abuse of the student visa system by immigrants desperate to stay in Britain. Tens of thousands of bogus students faked English language tests to beat UK border controls, the Government admitted. An estimated 48,000 immigrants had exploited the lax system in a 'shocking' scam run by criminal gangs, said Immigration Minister James Brokenshire. He revealed there had been 'systematic cheating' that allowed foreigners who could barely speak a word of English to stay in the country illegally, with corrupt invigilators reading out answers or allowing gangs of imposters to sit tests so the candidates could be awarded an English language certificate. In December last year, Iain Duncan Smith announced all migrants would have to demonstrate a ‘reasonable standard of English’ or be barred from claiming benefits. The Work and Pensions Secretary said tests applied to those who end up claiming any work-related welfare payments would be tightened. For the first time, migrants are to be quizzed about their language skills to determine whether these are likely to prove a barrier to them finding jobs. A Government spokesman said: ‘Funding for English language training is targeted at people whose lack of English is preventing them from finding work or isolating them from their community. ‘We have toughened up English language requirements for residency and citizenship but we do not subsidise learning for people seeking to meet these. ‘It is right that employers and individuals in work contribute towards the cost of their English language learning and so we do not fund workplace training.","Three-quarters-of-a-million migrants struggle to speak a word of English .

"A California 'beach bum' has no job, surfs and drinks when he wakes up every afternoon and has no intentions of finding employment anytime in the near future - yet, he eats lobster or gourmet sushi everyday. Jason Greenslate, 29, owes his successful culinary mooching to one thing: food stamps. Greenslate recently was profiled on Fox News for a special segment about the abuses of the nation's food stamp program. And despite mooching off American taxpayers for a living, Greenslate is remarkably unapologetic, nor does he feel any shame for abusing a system designed to help people who truly are in need. Beach bum: Greenslate doesn't plan on getting a job - and why would he? He gets free lobster . Dig in: Greenslate and his friends enjoy some taxpayer-funded lobster as they drink beer and play guitars . 'This is the way I want to live and I don’t really see anything . changing,' Greenslate said in the interview. 'It’s free . food; it’s awesome.' During a later interview with the Huffington Post, Greenslate added that 'I don't feel like a bum. I pull hot chicks, drive nice cars, . dress nice and wear the most baddest jewelry in the world.' During the segment, Greenslate is seen driving expensive cars, drinking beer and grilling lobsters with his friends. Before the cookout, cameras followed Greenslate into a grocery store and watched him purchase the food with his government-issued Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) card. SNAP: Greenslate is given $200 a month for food on his SNAP card, which features the California coast . With the card - which only needs to be renewed once a year - Greenslate is given $200 a month for food. There is no requirement that he even look for employment. Previously, there were stipulations that food stamp recipients with no family could only receive food stamps for three months every three years unless they had part time employment or were involved in a jobs program. The goal was to help people who couldn't make ends meet, not supplement income so people could surf and drink beer. Many of those types of restrictions were eliminated when President Barack Obama signed the 2009 stimulus bill, which allows people like Greenslate to abuse the system. On Thursday, Congress passed a bill that would reduce food stamp spending by five percent. Prior to the vote, Congressional leaders were shown the video featuring Greenslate. Video source The Roger Hedgecock Show . Wisdom: 'I don't feel like a bum. I pull hot chicks, drive nice cars, dress nice and wear the most baddest jewelry in the world.' 'You can no longer sit on your couch or ride a surfboard like Jason in California and expect the federal taxpayer to feed you,' Congressman Tim Huelskamp said following the vote. Republicans in Congress have used Greenslate as the poster-child for the need for entitlement reform. But Democrats have cast aside that notion, claiming that he doesn't represent the majority of the people who receive assistance. 'I don't give a damn about surfer dude,' Democratic Congressman Jim McGovern said. 'As far . as I'm concerned, he can walk off the nearest pier. To suggest that . he's the face of SNAP is offensive.' As for the Congressional vote, Greenslate noted, 'I don't think that one person should be the decision for 47 million people.'","29-year-old Jason Greenslate is given $200 in food stamps a month despite his not even attempting to find a job .

"A 15-year-old Massachusetts boy charged with killing his teacher last year faces new charges after an assault on a state youth services staffer. Prosecutors said Wednesday that Philip Chism has been indicted as a youthful offender on charges of attempted murder by strangulation, assault with intent to murder, kidnapping, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. He could face adult penalties if convicted. Prosecutors allege Chism attacked the 29-year-old woman on June 2 after following her into a bathroom at the youth facility in Boston where he was held. Scroll down for video . Danger to others: Prosecutors have requested tighter security for Philip Chism, 15 (pictured in January), after he allegedly escaped carers and tried to choke a youth worker . Co-workers stopped him when she cried for help. The woman declined medical treatment. Chism has pleaded not guilty to robbing, raping and killing 24-year-old Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer after following her into a school bathroom in October. Last month he was described as 'psychotic'by state prosecutors in a petition to have him evaluated and put under strict security. According to the petition to have Philip Chism committed to Worcester Recovery Center and Hospital for 30 days of evaluation and treatment, the 15-year-old was 'out of touch with reality' and 'yelling, screaming incoherently [and] foaming at the mouth while being restrained by staff.' The attack happened June 2 at a Department of Youth Services detention center. The details were released Tuesday by a Superior Court judge in response to a motion by The Salem News. Essex County prosecutors said 15-year-old Philip Chism slipped away from caregivers before the June 2 incident. Prosecutor . Kate MacDougall said Chism crept along a common hallway 'crouched down . out of view,' followed the woman to a locker room and tried to choke her . while holding a pencil. Other workers came to the woman's aid when she . screamed. In the petition to have Chism committed, psychologist Kenneth Rogers wrote that the teenager strangled, punched and stabbed the female unit clinician. 'Once pulled off her, he was out of touch with reality, screaming, yelling and moaning incoherently for about two hours even as he was taken away,' wrote Rogers. The document also stated that Chism's mother informed officials that before the June 2 attack her son had no history of psychosis. Alleged assault: Chism attacked a youth worker at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Boston, say prosecutors . During a hearing held June 10, the . prosecutor insisted that Chism not be left alone with female staff at . the facility, describing the teen as 'someone who appeared utterly calm . and fine in the moments leading up to the event.' Kate . MacDougall also expressed concern that within the detention center, . patients are free to move around, which could potentially put female . staff and patients at risk . Lester Blumberg, the Department of Mental Health attorney who represented the hospital at the hearing, assured the prosecutor that while the patients' rooms are not locked, Chism remains under guard at night and is rarely alone. Missed: Math teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24, was raped and murdered with a box cutter last October . Authorities . still don't know what motivated the transfer student . from Clarksville, Tenneessee to kill his teacher. He has pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape, robbery and murder in the death of Ritzer, whose body was found in the woods near Danvers High School in October. Her throat was slit and a note reading, 'I hate you all' was found at the scene. Chism, . who had been asked to stay late by Ritzer to help after school, . allegedly followed her into a bathroom on October 22 and attacked her, . sexually assaulted her twice, including once with a stick, stripped her and then stole her cellphone, . credit cars and her driver's licenses. According . to investigators, her body was then placed in a recycling bin and . carted away to a wooded area behind the school and dumped. After . dumping her body, prosecutors say Chism returned to school barefoot . where he changed into his soccer clothes and threw away his bloodied . school clothes. He then went to eat a burger at Wendy's and caught a screening of Woody Allen film 'Blue Jasmine'. Police . arrested him later that evening when he was found walking down a busy . highway. He had a bloody box-cutter in his pocket along with Ritzer's . underwear. In May, Ritzer's parents, Tom and Peggie Ritzer, issued a video statement . speaking about their loss while also thanking the community for their . support. 'These . past six months have been a period of great pain and sorrow for our . family and all those who knew and loved Colleen,' mother Peggie said. 'Each . day presents new challenges but we are blessed by the support of family . and friends. Through the many acts of genuine kindness to honor our . daughter and sister, our spirits are lifted. Though difficult, we strive . to follow Colleen's words to find good in every day.' Mental health: Chism's mental state is being evaluated at the Worcester State Hospital . Crime scene: Colleen Ritzer's body was found in a wooded area near Danvers High School following the brutal killing . Heartbroken: In a video shared last month, . Ritzer's family spoke about their loss while thanking the community for . support. Pictured is Ritzer's sister Laura, father Tom, mother Peggie and brother Tom . In the video, Mr Ritzer thanked everyone for turning out to raise money in Colleen's name. 'Thank . you for your kind words, generous gestures and support of the . scholarship fund in Colleen’s name that will empower future generations . of thoughtful, caring teachers to emulate Colleen’s passion to inspire . students to discover their full potential,' Mr Rtizer said, flanked by . Mrs Ritzer and Colleen's sister Laura and brother Tom. Following . his arrest, classmates and teachers at the school expressed shock that . such a quiet and polite boy could be accused of committing such a horrendous crime. Chism's . mother Diana - who is separated from father Stacey - said her son was . 'born in love' and that she is 'struggling to understand' the murder.","Philip Chism allegedly raped and murdered Danvers High School math teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24, in a school bathroom last October .

Patients would have to undergo fewer operations, be left with smaller wounds, and have a greater chance of survival. Use of the iKnife could also allow surgeons to tackle operations currently deemed too risky to attempt . Use of the iKnife could also allow surgeons to tackle operations currently deemed too risky to attempt. The device’s inventor, Dr Zoltan Takats, of Imperial College London, said: ‘It has been long-recognised that it would be nice to have a real-time identification of tissue, kind of a magic wand. One could touch the tissue and it would immediately tell what kind of tissue it was. ‘The iKnife provides a result almost instantly, allowing surgeons to carry out procedures with a level of accuracy that hasn’t been possible before. It has the potential to reduce tumour recurrence rates and enable more patients to survive.’ More than 300,000 cases of cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year – leading to almost two million operations. The iKnife is a combination of two existing pieces of equipment, which tells the surgeon as he cuts through the flesh if it is diseased . But even the best surgeons cannot be sure of removing the entire tumour. This can lead to the disease returning or mean the patient needs a second operation. At present, cancer surgeons use scans carried out before the operation to guide them as they cut into the patient. During the operation, they can also send a sample of tissue to the laboratory to confirm if it is cancerous or healthy. But this is expensive, time-consuming and, crucially, the results are not always accurate. Dr Takats’ solution is the iKnife, a combination of two existing pieces of equipment, which tells the surgeon as he cuts through the flesh if it is diseased. The first piece of equipment, an electric scalpel, is already routinely used in operations to sear through flesh. As it does this it produces smoke, which is usually sucked away by extractor fans. Dr Takats realised the smoke is valuable because it contains information about the flesh that was burnt away. So he used a tube to collect the smoke and pass it to a mass spectrometer. It analyses the smoke and by comparing its chemical make-up with the make-up of known tumours, it can tell if the tissue was cancerous or not. The results then flash up on a screen next to the surgeon. Some analyses take less than a second. In a study involving operations on 91 cancer patients, it proved to be 100 per cent accurate, the journal Science Translational Medicine reports. The device is already being used in three London hospitals, as part of a larger study. If it is as successful as hoped, it could be in widespread use in two or three years.","iKnife could allow surgeons to tackle risky operations .

"The mysterious combination of numbers and letters 'A113' that has been popping up in Pixar films for over a decade is well known to people in the animation industry. The secret behind the code, which made appearances in various forms in the Toy Story trilogy, Finding Nemo, A Bug’s Life, Up, Brave, as well as animated shows like The Simpsons and American Dad, and even live-action movies like Hunger Games: Catching Fire, is that it's an intentional inside joke.

"Immigrants with more than one wife will qualify for extra benefits under reforms to Britain’s welfare system, after an attempt to crack down on the problem backfired. Polygamous marriages, largely confined to Muslim families, are only recognised in Britain if they took place in countries where they are legal. Currently, any additional wives can receive reduced individual income support, meaning the husband and his first wife are paid up to £111.45. Error: The Department for Work and Pensions' reforms have inadvertently opened up a loophole for polygamous households . Subsequent spouses living under the . same roof receive around £40. Under the new system of Universal Credit, . which comes in next year, polygamous marriages will not be recognised at . all. Ministers pledged to end the ‘absurd’ benefits regime which has seen multiple wives allowed to claim extra welfare payments. But a House of Commons Library paper . has highlighted a loophole in the rules which will allow additional . wives to claim a full single person’s allowance, currently worth up to . £71, while the original married couple will still get a married couple’s . allowance. The paper said: ‘Treating second and . subsequent partners in polygamous relationships as separate claimants . could mean that polygamous households receive more under Universal . Credit than under the current rules.’ The Department for Work and Pensions . admitted the loophole but said there were fewer than 50 polygamous . families claiming benefits. The first Asian woman to receive a peerage, Baroness Flather, has spoken out widely on the issue of polygamous families claiming benefits. There are around 1,000 polygamous homes in Britain, the majority of which are Muslim . 'Under Islamic Sharia law, polygamy is permissible. So a man can return to Pakistan, take another bride and then, in a repetition of the process, bring her to England where they also have children together — obtaining yet more money from the state,' she wrote in the Mail last year. 'Because such Islamic multiple-marriages are not recognised in Britain, the women are regarded by the welfare system as single mothers — and are therefore entitled to the full range of lone-parent payments. We cannot continue like this. 'Why are they allowed to have more than one wife,' she added. 'We should prosecute one or two people for bigamy, that would sort it out.' Currently in the UK it is illegal to marry more than once. But if the multiple marriages took place abroad then it is not. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions told MailOnline said that the loophole will exist because extra wives in a polygamous home are treated as single. 'Polygamy is illegal in this country and it would be wrong for the benefits system to legitimise these arrangements by recognising them in any way,' they said.","Extra wives will soon be able to claim full single person's benefits despite being married .
Government admits loophole will exist because of their reforms .
They do not want to recognise polygamy in any way, so treat extra wives as single, they told MailOnline ."

"Los Angeles will pay $215,000 to a black man who was tossed out of a city commission meeting for wearing a Ku Klux Klan hood. The City Council vote last Wednesday to settle a free-speech lawsuit by Michael Hunt, according to the Los Angeles Times. Mr Hunt, who is from the Venice area, wore the hood and a T-shirt emblazoned with a profanity and a racial slur against African-Americans during a 2011 meeting of the Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners. Ejected: Michael Hunt was thrown out of a Los Angeles city commission meeting for wearing this KKK hood . Mr Hunt has worn the outfit at other city meetings to confront what he believes is government discrimination, said his lawyer, Stephen Rohde. 'He has co-opted these images and uses them to protest back against the city,' Mr Rohde said. At the parks commission meeting, then-President Barry Sanders told Hunt that his garb violated city rules of decorum and told him to remove the hood and 'offensive signage' or be ejected. Hunt was escorted out and cited for disturbing a public assembly but was not prosecuted. The settlement 'means that the city is held accountable when it violates civil rights and First Amendment rights,' Mr Rohde said. Instead of starting up an expensive trial, the city settled the claims made by Michael Hunt that his free speech was violated . City Councilman Bernard Parks, who also is black, said the council decided to settle because it might have been forced to pay much more in legal fees if the case had gone to trial. 'This is one of those things where you hold your nose and vote,' Mr Parks said. The city recently lost another federal case that Rohde had brought on behalf of two men who were repeatedly ejected from council meetings and alleged violation of their rights. A jury awarded the men $1 each but it cost the city around $600,000 in legal fees, Parks said. Mr Hunt, a vendor on the Venice Boardwalk, also sued in 2009 to challenge vending restrictions at the tourist attraction. A jury awarded him $264,286 and the city paid his lawyer $340,000 in fees.","Michael Hunt wore the hood during a protest in 2011 .

"Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer head-butted his wife and broke her nose after she refused to have sex with him, and punched her in the face the next day, police revealed today. The details surfaced in a law enforcement report a day after Dwyer was arrested on aggravated assault charges and deactivated from all team activities. He spent a night in jail and made a brief court appearance before being released early Thursday. Dwyer, 25, was arrested Wednesday for investigation in two altercations that occurred on July 21 and 22 at his Phoenix residence, just days before the Cardinals reported to training camp. Scroll down for video . Domestic violence: Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer (far right) is accused of beating up his wife, Kayla (center) for refusing to have sex with him and throwing a shoe at their young son (pictured) Arrested: Dwyer was arrested Wednesday on aggravated assault charges in connection with two altercations at his home in July involving his family . His wife, 27-year-old Kayla Tobin Dwyer, left the state after the incidents, but came forward a week ago after Dwyer apparently sent suicidal text messages including a photo of a knife. In the first encounter, police say Dwyer attempted to kiss and undress his wife, but she refused. Someone who heard the argument reported the assault to police, who showed up at the apartment but did not make an arrest. Dwyer hid in a bathroom and the wife denied he was in the home because the running back threatened to kill himself in front of her and their child if she told police about the assault, police said. The next day, Dwyer punched his wife with a closed fist on the left side of her face, according to police. He also punched walls and threw a shoe at his 17-month-old son, who was not injured. As Kayla Dwyer tried to call police, Dwyer grabbed her cellphone and threw it down from the home's second story. Witnesses told police that Dwyer's wife said, ‘I'm calling the police’ as she held her swollen face and clutched her son. During his police interview, Dwyer acknowledged hiding in the bathroom when police responded to the first argument and sending a photo of a knife with suicidal threats. Dwyer denied committing an assault, though he acknowledged that he punched walls in his home, threw a phone and that his wife bit his lip during the disputes, according to the police report. As he was released from jail Thursday, he said he never hurt his son. Jonathan Dwyer was released from jail at around 5am Thursday after posting a $25,000 cash bond. When asked by a gaggle of reporters if he will ever play football again, he simply replied: 'I will,' according to KPHO. Dwyer was ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device and banned from having contact with his wife and so; he also cannot travel outside Arizona or be in possession of weapons, drugs or alcohol. Authorities depicted a stormy relationship between Dwyer and his wife, a flight attendant from North Carolina, that escalated into violence on July 21, four days before the Cardinals reported to training camp. Neighbors heard a fight and called police, who showed up at the residence but left without making an arrest because Dwyer hid in the bathroom and the woman said no one else was at the home, Sgt. Trent Crump told the Associated Press. 'She said she was in an argument on the phone only,' Crump said. '[Police officers] were convinced that the fight was verbal [and] that it was called in by a third party,' Crump also told AZ Central. '[The 27-year-old woman] convinced them of that while he was hiding in the home.' Handcuffed: Phoenix police officers escort Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer,  to the 4th Avenue Jail following his arrest on Wednesday . The Cardinals released a statement Wednesday saying 'We became aware of these allegations this afternoon when notified by Phoenix police and are cooperating fully. 'Given the serious nature of the allegations we have taken the immediate step to deactivate Jonathan from all team activities. 'We will continue to closely monitor this as it develops and evaluate additional information as it becomes available.' Hot temper: Dwyer denied committing an assault or hurting his son, though he acknowledged that he punched walls in his home . The NFL said the case will be reviewed under the league's personal-conduct policy. The NFL has been rocked by domestic violence issues ever since a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator. Then Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson was indicted on felony child-abuse charges. On Wednesday, the Carolina Panthers decided that star defensive end Greg Hardy will not play any more games for the team until his domestic violence case is resolved. Hardy was convicted of assault on a female and communicating threats after the victim said the 6-foot-4, 275-pound player threw her in the bathtub and onto a sofa covered with guns before threatening to kill her. Hardy is appealing the ruling. Critics have been calling for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's resignation for his handling of Rice's case. Rice was originally suspended for two games, then banned indefinitely after the video surfaced of his attack in the casino elevator. This is the second domestic violence case involving a Cardinals player. Inside linebacker Daryl Washington pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend and is serving a year of supervised probation. Washington has not yet been penalized by the NFL for the offense but is suspended for this season for violating the league's substance abuse policy. Sidelined: The Cardinals deactivated Jonathan Dwyer from all team activities following his arrest . Athlete: Dwyer, 25, signed with the Cardinals earlier this year and was their second-string running back after spending the last four years with the Pittsburgh Steelers . Dwyer was led into the jail in handcuffs to be booked on counts that include aggravated assault causing a fracture and involving a minor, criminal damage and preventing the use of a phone in an emergency. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, which runs the jail, said Dwyer has refused all media interviews. Dwyer signed with the Cardinals this year and was their second-string running back after spending the last four seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

"Clutching a bunch of flowers, this little boy cuts a rather forlorn figure as he watches the Queen get into her car. The reason? He was one of dozens of children left disappointed when the Queen broke with tradition by not accepting flowers in Sandringham yesterday. More than 1,000 people, many of whom had travelled long distances, gathered outside St Mary Magdalene Church to cheer the Queen as she arrived for the morning service. Don't go! A little boy watches the Queen get into her Bentley yesterday, as he clutches a bouquet he had hoped to give her . Maybe next time: The little boy is comforted by his mother after the Queen broke with tradition by not stopping for the flowers . Elegant: The Queen wore a vivid shade of purple as she arrived at church this morning . Looking good: The Queen completed her all-purple ensemble with a Launer bag . She usually accepts flowers from children every Sunday morning during her Christmas break in Norfolk. But yesterday she paused only to wave to wellwishers as she emerged after the service ended at 11.45am. The Queen was then driven straight back to Sandringham House in her maroon Bentley. One parent, who asked not to be named, said: ‘We drove more than 50 miles with our five-year-old daughter so she could present a small bouquet to the Queen. 'She had practised how to curtsey and it would have been a big moment for her so it was very disappointing to be told that the Queen was not receiving any flowers. ‘This policeman just told us that it was not happening today because the Queen was late for her family lunch on Christmas Day due to so many children giving her flowers.’ Well-wrapped: The Queen was tucked beneath a blue wool blanket as she was driven to the service . Cheerful: The monarch chattde with well-wishers as she makes her way into St Mary Magdalene church . Family affair: The Prince of Wales and Sir Timothy Laurence (left), and the Countess of Wessex and Lady Louise Windsor (right) She's arrived! Princess Anne smiles as the Queen's car arrives while a policeman offers a respectful salute . Another onlooker said: 'I have been . coming to church services at Sandringham for 20 years and this is the . first time that I can remember that the Queen has not accepted flowers.' Normally . children are allowed under a rope outside the 13th century church and . line up by the steps so that they can file past the Queen and hand her . their bouquets. The Queen then usually gives the flowers to a policewoman who puts them in the back of her car. On . Christmas Day, an estimated 5,000 members of the public watched the . royals at Sandringham, with children queuing up to present posies to the . Queen. So overwhelmed were . the royals by the numbers, that the Duchess of Cambridge had to lend a . hand and collected flowers from a second line. It is thought that more than 100 children wanted to give flowers to the Queen on Christmas Day. Yesterday Princess Anne, who was also at the church, accepted some bouquets on her mother’s behalf. Last night, officials dismissed the suggestion that the Queen was rushing for lunch. It is understood she does not usually eat until later in the day. Hale and hearty: The Duke of Edinburgh appeared to have enjoyed his walk to church with the Princess Royal . Cheerful: The Duke of Edinburgh appeared to be in good spirits as he arrived on foot for the service . Chic: Sophie Wessex offered royal fashion fans a treat courtesy of an elegant navy blue coat and fedora . Collection: Princess Anne accepted bouquets of flowers from waiting children instead of the Queen . A palace spokesman said: ‘Her Majesty . is always grateful whenever people wish to present flowers and she . accepted many flowers on Christmas Day. ‘However, she does not accept them in person on every occasion.’ Accompanying . Her Majesty at the ceremony were senior royals, among them Prince . Charles, the Princess Royal and the Duke of Edinburgh, as well as the . Earl and Countess of Wessex. The . Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Anne, dressed in a striking crimson . ensemble, led the way from the main house on foot, with Prince Charles . and . Prince Edward walking behind. Also . appearing at the village church was the Earl and Countess of Wessex' daughter, Lady Louise Windsor, who wore the same green velvet-collared . coat for the third year in a row, but Zara Phillips, Prince Harry and . Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were nowhere to be seen. It is believed that the Duchess of Cornwall also left Sandringham House after Christmas Day to spend time with her family. Instead, . fashion fans had to content themselves with the sight of Sophie Wessex, . elegant in a navy coat and matching trilby, and the monarch herself who . wowed the crowd in a suitably regal purple coat and hat. During the service, which was led by the Bishop of Norwich, the Rt Rev Graham James, prayers . were said for people living in Syria, those serving in Afghanistan and . the family of Captain Richard Holloway, the Royal Engineer killed in . action two days before Christmas. The congregation also prayed for those who suffered the effects of flooding and severe weather over the festive period. She's just arrived at the age where little girls begin to choose their own clothes but it seems that Lady Louise Windsor, 10, is happier with old favourites. The Queen's youngest granddaughter appeared at church in Sandringham this morning in a green tweed coat first worn to a Christmas service two years ago. Since then, the garment has been on outings to Royal Ascot and to this year's Easter service at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, as well as at subsequent festive services at Sandringham. Clearly, the young Lady Louise resembles her famously thrifty grandmother in more ways than one.

"In a meeting Tuesday afternoon with executives and lawyers from 14 media companies, Attorney General Eric Holder acknowledged that he and his team 'are not satisfied' with the way search warrants for reporters' phone records and emails were executed in cases involving leaks of classified information. Referring to his own agency's description of Fox News Channel reporter James Rosen as a possible criminal co-conspirator for reporting information leaked to him by a State Department source, Holder said he was ‘not comfortable with that characterization of Mr. Rosen.’ ‘He wasn’t aiding he enemy,' the attorney general said. 'He was just reporting news.’ 'There was no chance he was ever going to be prosecuted,' Holder added. ‘I find it incomprehensible that it ever would happen.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Fox's James Rosen was just doing his job, and would never have been prosecuted, but an affidavit Holder approved told a federal judge otherwise . The U.S. Department of Justice headquarters in . Washington, D.C. was the site of Attorney General Eric Holder's meeting . Tuesday with executives from major U.S. media companies. Fox News . reporter James Rosen's case has become a rallying cry for journalists . concerned about government interference with the First Amendment . Holder told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday that his agency had no plans to prosecute reporters involved in leak scandals. 'The Department [of Justice] has not prosecuted, and as long as I'm Attorney General, will not prosecute any reporter for doing his or her job,' he said. In Tuesday's closed meeting, Holder addressed the cases involving Fox News and the Associated Press, in which the DOJ obtained search warrants for reporters' records and emails without notifying the media companies they work for. In Rosen's case, Holder personally approved a warrant that leaned on the Espionage Act of 1917 in order to satisfy technicalities in the Privacy Protection Act of 1980. That latter statute requires notification of media outlets before the federal government can interfere with journalists, unless certain conditions are met. One of those exceptions is the formal identification of a reporter as a criminal suspect. The DOJ asserted to a federal judge that Rosen himself was an investigative target, and could be criminally liable for publishing state secrets which harmed the United States. That claim, once made, persuaded a judge to approve the warrant. Holder is now under fire for telling the U.S. Congress that he was wholly unfamiliar with any ‘potential prosecution’ of reporters in cases like these, testimony that Congress is investigating as possible perjury. Deputy Attorney General James Cole explained that regulations under which the DOJ operates require him to determine -- before notifying a media company that a reporter's records are the subject of a warrant -- that the disclosure will not jeopardize an ongoing investigation. That, he conceded, put him in the position of having had to prove a negative before notifying the AP or Fox. But when pressed by MailOnline, Holder confirmed that there is no legal barrier stopping him from declaring on his own that the DOJ will no longer withhold that information from publishers and their attorneys. ‘We could do that,’ he said. ‘The big guy at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue would have to check the box, but yes, we could.’ Holder also acknowledged that during the Obama presidency, his agency has yet to be 'burned' by sharing that kind of information with news agencies involved in similar cases. And he said that the DOJ has no other outstanding leak cases involving requests for reporters' private records. Holder agreed that President Obama could approve a new policy requiring the DOJ to notify media outlets every time records of journalists are sought in court, even though certain legal situations don't require it . President Obama has asked the attorney general for a set of recommendations by July 12, describing what can and should be done to change the way his agency treats cases that uncover a conflict between press freedom and national security. But he was careful to point out that a proposed press shield law, which Obama favors, won't be a substitute for his own responsiveness to the president. 'I don’t want what we do to be tied to the shield law,’ Holder said. 'And I don’t think this is brain surgery.’ The DOJ caught flak from reporters last . week after inviting them to two similar meetings about press freedoms, . and initially insisting that they should be considered  'off the . record.' That designation demands that . journalists refrain from reporting on the event in any way. The DOJ . ultimately relented, holding a sparsely attended meeting on Friday, . after which reporters and editors were permitted to discuss broadly the . content of the discussion. But of Tuesday's meeting, Holder said, 'We weren't intending it to be really ""off the record.""' 'I'm not sure what the status really is,' he conceded at one point. State Department contractor Stephen Kim allegedly leaked state serets to Fox News reporter James Rosen, setting off a powder keg that has the attorney general's neck in a congressional guillotine . MailOnline . attended the meeting. Attendees on Tuesday were asked to . 'refrain from talking about specific suggestions' offered by the group . of 20 executives and attorneys, and one working journalist. Floating those suggestions publicly, a DOJ official said, could cause workable ideas to fall prey to premature public naysaying. That official also asked that the participants refrain from reporting on the content of discussions about ongoing investigations. Holder's comments, however, make it clear that Rosen is not the subject of any criminal investigation. MailOnline is also refraining from reporting on solutions the . group offered to the thorny problem of how to balance national security . concerns with journalists' freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment . to the U.S. Constitution. Media organizations in attendance on Tuesday were the Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Dow Jones, Fox News Channel, the Hearst Corporation, MailOnline, NBC News, the New York Daily News, The New York Times, The New Yorker, Politico, USA Today and The Washington Post.","Holder hosted closed meeting of news moguls Tuesday as accusations swirled that he lied to Congress about probing Fox News' James Rosen .

"As a successful TV chef, you might expect Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall to urge you to eat more. But the presenter of Channel 4’s River Cottage series has turned to fasting to offset his Christmas ‘gluttony’, he said yesterday. He has become the latest supporter of ‘intermittent fasting’, heralded as the biggest diet revolution since the Atkins. Dieters eat normally for five days a week but dramatically reduce their food intake on the other two days. Weight loss: Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has already lost 8lbs since embarking on the 'intermittent fasting' diet . Slimming down: Fearnley-Whittingstall looks vastly different from his former, more portly, self . Fearnley-Whittingstall, 48, admitted he struggled to stick to his own River Cottage lifestyle of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, writing: ‘At the turn of the year, like so many, I consumed way too much meat, cheese, cream, sugar and alcohol. ‘And despite a garden bursting with brussel sprouts, kale and winter . salads, and a weekly delivery of organic apples, oranges, clementines . and bananas, I know I didn’t eat nearly enough fruit and veg to offset . the gluttony.’ He said he had started intermittent fasting on New Year’s Day, meaning he has gone through six days of fasting, and had lost 8lb. The chef limited his food intake on fast days to a 250-calorie breakfast and a 350-calorie supper and drank black and herbal teas during the day to stave off hunger pangs. The chef said despite having a garden full of vegetables he indulged in dairy, meat and alcohol . Supporters claim that fasting can help dieters to lose weight, live . longer and delay diseases including dementia, diabetes and some cancers. The regime supposedly mimics the lifestyles of our ancestors, when . humans had to hunt for food and did not eat high-energy foods such as . meat, fat and sugar on a daily basis. Writing in the Guardian, Fearnley-Whittingstall said our modern-day . favourites like burgers and chocolate brownies were ‘delicious, but . insane’. He said: ‘These compound meals, too often glued together with . synthesised products our bodies don’t even recognise as food, curdle and . rot in our stomachs, giving us varying degrees of nausea, acid reflux, . gaseousness and cramp, and pushing our stressed digestive systems to the . absolute limit. ‘No wonder we’re bloating like dead whales and dropping like flies. ‘Of course, I realise that all my books and television shows are largely complicit with this disastrous approach to eating. ‘I like to think I am at the healthier, more natural end of the spectrum . - in fact, my professional self-respect is predicated on that. ‘But I think it would be unwise not to acknowledge that even the “River . Cottage diet” - rich as it ought to be in fresh vegetables and fruit - . is open to abuse. And I should know: I abuse it often enough.’ The book The Fast Diet by Dr Michael Mosley tells you to eat normally for five days a week – up to 2,000 calories a day for woman and 2,500 for men. On the other two, women limit their food intake to 500 calories a day and men 600. Supporters claim the regime is easier to stick to than a traditional diet, and research has found links between fasting and the body’s ability to repair itself. Dr Mosley, who presented a BBC2 Horizon programme on the subject last year, lost a stone in six weeks and cut his body fat by a quarter. Critics question whether extreme calorie restriction is healthy and warn that fasting can be addictive. Fearnley-Whittingstall said he felt ‘lean and sharp’ but questioned whether he would continue to fast regularly. He said: ‘I’ve lost eight pounds already, and I find the whole thing rather exhilarating. I feel I might just be part of a health revolution. ‘But is it really sustainable, for me or for significant numbers of others? Can I honestly say I’m backing myself to be fasting regularly a year from now? ‘I very much want the answer to be yes. Then I look at the rowing machine propped up in the corner of the kids’ playroom. This time last year I was pounding it for 2,000 metres twice a week. It didn’t last past the first chocolate egg.’","The chef has already lost 8lbs since starting starting diet at New Year .

"A suspected stalker threatened to decapitate a lingerie model known as Philadelphia's 'hottest blonde', it is claimed. Luis Plascencia, 47, sent the barrage of hate-filled messages through Facebook and e-mail to Kourtney Reppert, it is alleged. The 26-year-old Playboy hostess was so terrified she hired security guards for her birthday party at a nightclub in April. Plascencia was arrested at his home in Chicago and held without a bond. He will appear in court today to face the charges which carry a maximum of five years in prison. Threats: Lingerie model Kourtney Reppert, 26, allegedly received a barrage of disturbing emails and Facebook messages from Luis Plascencia . One message is claimed ho have said: 'I hope you die in an automobile accident and [it] crushes your ugly face through the windshield and a large piece of glass cuts your throat.' Plascencia is alleged to have later used a computer at the Chicago Public Library to send  emails threatening to cut Reppert's head off and chop her parents 'to pieces with a hand saw'  unless she stopped modelling. The FBI affidavit states that Plascencia lived with his mother and sent messages using a number of different email addresses, according to LA Weekly. He was apparently angry that the model was posing semi-nude, in lingerie and bikinis. But in one instance Plascencia is alleged to have impersonated a photographer in an attempt to get Miss Reppert to pose nude for him. Another alleged message added: 'I'm going to stab you in the f*****g heart and cut your head off'. He is also said to have branded her a 'slut', a 'whore', a 'gutless b***h' and a 'fat ass'. The charges claim that Plascencia also sent Miss Reppert a CD containing 234 photographs of her that he had collected. Fearful: The model was so terrified by the emails that she had to hire bodyguards and even security for her birthday party, police files claim . The suspected stalker is said to have threatened to cut off the head of the Playboy hostess, pictured here in a blue bikini . According to detectives, Plascencia posted letters to Reppert's former address, and those of her father and stepmother. Another email excerpted in the criminal complaint stated: 'I warned you before about doing this and will continue my wrath until you step down as a model go back to college and move back near your family in Philly. I know where you are most of the time.' Reppert told authorities she was so disturbed by the messages that she hired bodyguards to go out with her in public. Security guards were also used to protect her birthday party in April at a nightclub. The model claimed that a private detective she employed confronted Plascencia about the suspected stalking. He is said to have apologised before deleting files on his computer. But when police raided his apartment they are said to have found CDs containing images of the Miss Reppert set to music. Alias: Plascencia is alleged to have sent some of the messages from Chicago Public Library, pictured, using different email addresses . Reppert tweeted that she initially declined to speak publicly about the allegations and was 'disappointed' her identity had been revealed through the FBI files. 'This has been a very stressful time for me and my family,' Reppert wrote on Facebook yesterday. 'I will remain positive.' The glamour model moved from Philadelphia to LA last year and has since worked as a hostess at the Playboy mansion. Philladelphia radio hosts Steve Morrison and Preston Elliot also rated her the state's 'hottest blonde' on their 'Preston and Steve' show  on 93.3 WMMR. According to her website, she also studied business and marketing at college and is the CEO and founder of Bombshell Marketing.","Kourtney Reppert, 26, identified in FBI files as model who received threats .

"Under current laws should a Queen marry a woman she would automatically be given the title of King . Changes are to be made to the way royal titles are granted in order to stop a man becoming a Queen or a woman a king in light of next month's same-sex marriage law. Under the current rules if Britain were to have a gay king, his husband would be statutorily be made a Queen. Likewise a Queen's same-sex consort would be a king. And if a future prince of Wales were to marry a man, his husband would automatically be grated the title princess of Wales. Civil servants have trawled through dozens of statutes and regulations going back as far as 1285 in what legal experts have described as a 'tidying-up' exercise, the Daily Telegraph reports. The changes will extend to dukes, earls and other male peers in order to prevent a same-sex husband becoming a duchess, countess or lady. However fervent equal rights campaigners may be disappointed because while it will remain high treason to commit adultery with a king's wife or queen's husband that will not be the case with a same–sex consort. Proposed amendments to 36 Acts dating back to 1859 and a further 67 pieces of legislation dating back 729 years, are to be set out in a draft order. They will cover exclusions from the effects of the Same–Sex Marriage Act as well as changes to pension regulations. A clause in the Act which gives gay and heterosexual marriage the same legal force will not apply to anyone 'who marries, or who is married to, the king regnant, to the title of queen'. However the Coalition for Marriage, which . is campaigning against gay marriage, said the changes showed what a . 'complete mess', the act has made of the law. Reforms: The changes will extend to dukes, earls and other male peers in order to prevent a same-sex husband becoming a duchess, countess or lady . Spokesman Colin Hart told the Telegraph: 'We repeatedly warned that the Government's plans were ill thought out, complicated and would have a damaging effect. 'Just a few months later we have ministers engaged in an unprecedented and systematic drive to airbrush out of law words like husband, wife and widow in order to make the legislation work. 'It is clear the Government is in a complete mess.'","Under the current rules if Britain were to have a gay king, his husband would be statutorily be a Queen .

Tens of . thousands of the under-18s – 'Unaccompanied Alien Children' (UACs) in . government-speak – have poured across the U.S.-Mexico border in recent . months, creating what President Barack Obama has termed an 'urgent . humanitarian situation.' HHS, which houses them until family members can be found, has begun releasing illegal immigrant children 'by the hundreds' into the custody of adults who are illegal immigrants themselves, an HHS official familiar with the situation on America's southern border told MailOnline late on Tuesday. An official spokesman for HHS's Administration for Children and Families confirmed on Wednesday that the agency has no system in place to verify whether the adults are here legally. Kenneth Wolfe told MailOnline on Wednesday that 'around 90 percent of the minors in the UAC . program are released to verified sponsors (mostly family members) in the . U.S.' Asked if 'verified' means that the adults' immigration status has been checked, he responded, 'No.' He . also answered 'no' when asked if there is 'an effort made to ascertain . the immigration status of the adults who claim the kids.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Waiting: Illegal immigrant children are held in Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma being moved to shelters . Military bases have become emergency housing facilities for the children, who are housed by the government -- first in Homeland Security facilities like this one, and then at locations chosen by HHS -- until a relative can be found in the U.S. Most of the . children are turning themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents, who . transport them to a facility where they are processed and given 'notices . to appear' before an immigration judge between 10 and 90 days later. HHS . takes over after that, drawing on a $1 billion budget to house, feed . and otherwise care for the children until a suitable adult family member . can be located to claim them. The . first HHS official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not . authorized to comment to the press, said his agency first tries to find a . legal U.S. resident related to each child to take custody. But . barring that outcome, he cautioned, 'I know they're more concerned with . clearing the caseload than with the immigration status of the adult . sponsors.' As many as 90,000 are expected to go through the system during the government's fiscal year that ends on September 30. The official said the glut of cases at military bases serving as 'holding facilities' threatens to 'overwhelm our ability to care for all these kids in the long-term.' 'It's just not sustainable, is what I'm telling you,' he said. 'So to bottom-line it, would you rather see these kids in glorified warehouses or reunited with a family member who doesn't belong here?' According . to official statistics from the Department of Homeland Security, . deportations of illegal immigrants under the Obama administration have . spiked to new highs. But . those numbers are deceptive: Changes in terminology have left . head-counters with no choice but to roll several categories together, . now classifying cases where immigrants are stopped and turned back at . the border as 'deportations.' Actual . expulsions of people who have crossed the border unlawfully and then . settled in America's interior are down more than 40 per cent since . Obama's first year in office. The resulting contradiction allows Obama to publicly embrace a tough-on-immigration image while privately assuring his Latino constituency that he means to allow more Mexican and Central American aliens to stay with each passing year. A scenario where HHS gradually mainstreams thousands of the children flooding into the U.S. from south of the border by turning them over to undocumented adults would fit that pattern. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took issue with what appears to be an unprecedented immigration policy-in-the-making on Tuesday night during a town hall broadcast on CNN. Mixed messages: The White House held a ceremony on Monday to honor ten young illegal immigrants as 'champions of change' Flood: Border Patrol buses drive underage illegal immigrants from the border to temporary facilities where they are processed and given court dates before being transferred to HHS . 'They . should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible . adults in their families are,' Clinton said of the children. She . told question-and-answer moderator Christiane Amanpour that 'all of . them that can be should be reunited with their families' in their home . countries. 'We . have to send a clear message,' Clinton said: 'Just because your child . gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay.' Tough: Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has left open the question of what happens when illegal immigrants try to claim their children, while insisting that he was 'not encouraging in any way, shape or form illegal migration' If Clinton decides to run for president, her position will land her in unusual company. Republican . lawmakers have slammed the Obama administration for failing to enforce . immigration law, and for instituting a 'Deferred Action' program in 2012 . that cancels deportation orders for people brought into the U.S. as . children before June 2007. News . of that policy, they argue, has filtered down to impoverished Central . Americans and the human-trafficking 'coyotes' who guide them, . sherpa-like, through hundreds of miles of Mexican wilderness. Tens of thousands of children may believe they will benefit from what Washington insiders have termed Obama's 'mini-amnesty.' Clinton will also find herself in agreement with Federal Judge Andrew S. Hanen, who ruled in December that the Obama administration aided drug cartels by knowingly allowing a 10-year-old Salvadoran girl to complete her illegal trek into the U.S. by reuniting her with her illegal immigrant mother in Virginia. The Department of . Homeland Security, Hanen wrote, is 'delivering the minors to the custody . of the parent illegally living in the United States.' The agency also never prosecuted the mother or took any action to remove her from the United States. Hanen wrote in his ruling that the case of Patricia Elizabeth Salmeron Santos, who paid a trafficker $8,500 to bring her child across the border, was the fourth case he had seen in a month. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, he wrote, flew the children to multiple locations in order to locate their parents, even though they had no legal basis to be in the country. 'The DHS has simply chosen not to enforce the United States' border security laws,' according to Hanen. It is 'completing the criminal mission of individuals who are violating the border security of the United States.' According to HHS materials . that Wolfe emailed to MailOnline last week, the Homeland Security Act . of 2002 changed the federal government's focus in these cases, 'to move . towards a child welfare-based-model of care for children and away from . the adult detention model.' 'The . average length of stay in the program is currently near 35 days. Of the . children served, some 85% are reunified with their families.' It's unclear how many of those family members are in the United States legally, and how many are outside the U.S. MailOnline's source at HHS said he suspected the number staying in the United States would grow 'as the space issues become harder to manage.' Meanwhile, taxpayers cover expenses related to classroom education, recreation and mental health and medical services at facilities on military bases including Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Ventura County Naval Base in southern California and Fort Sill Army Base in Oklahoma. But HHS's policy is to send most of them to 'state-licensed' care providers licensed by its Office of Refugee . Resettlement. That . agency describes its mission as 'provid[ing] new populations with . opportunities to maximize their potential in the United States, linking . people in need to critical resources to assist them in becoming . integrated members of American society.' The National Catholic Register reported on Friday that a church-funded shelter in McAllen, Texas – ground zero for the rush of underage illegals – planned to shelter 'hundreds ... each week.' 'In the Brownsville Diocese alone,' the sectarian newspaper reported, '13 shelters house the immigrant kids. Catholic adults volunteer in all of them. The two largest facilities shelter up to 300 at a time.' Kristyn Peck, associate director of children’s services for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Children and Migration Office, said that 'these are children. It is in our mandate as Catholics to care about this population.' 'Given opportunities to thrive, they will thrive,' Peck said. 'They are incredible people.'","The US Dept. of Health and Human Service takes custody of tens of thousands of minors each year who cross the border without their parents .

"A British backpacker screamed for help for more than an hour in fear of being raped by the manager of an Indian hotel where she was staying. Sachin Chauhan, the manager of the Hotel Agra Mahal where the incident took place, appeared in court today alongside one other man accused of harassing the woman. The 32-year-old tourist, from Greenwich, London, injured herself when she eventually jumped from the hotel's second floor window in desperation. She told police how the manager of the hotel, in the northern city of Agra, knocked on her door at 3:45am saying that he wanted to shower her and give her an oil massage, after she requested a 4am wake-up.

Incident: The room at the Agra Mahal hotel where the woman had been staying and alleged that the hotel's manager woke her at 3:45am . Claims: Inside the room where the woman said the hotel manager and later the hotel security guard made repeated attempts to enter . Under arrest: Sachin Chauhan, manager of the Hotel Agra Mahal, has been arrested after a British tourist fled an alleged assault in her room . She is expected to to return to the UK after being admitted to hospital with minor leg injuries, while the hotel manager has been remanded in custody for 14 days. The woman, who had been due to leave the hotel on Tuesday morning to travel to Jaipur, said she refused the man's advances and pushed him out of the room. The woman said that Sachin Chauhan made repeated attempts to enter the room after she initially removed him and bolted the door . Describing him as 'insistent' in a statement to police, heard by the Daily Telegraph, the woman bolted the door, but the man allegedly remained outside trying to get in with his keys until 5am. She told police: 'I was shouting at him to stop harassing me, I told him I wanted him to go.' 'I was too scared to leave my room as he was waiting outside. I was kicking the door and shouting for help but no one came.' The manager of the hotel, which is situated close to the Taj Mahal, was yesterday arrested, while the British tourist was last night believed to be under police guard at another hotel. Senior superintendent Subhash Chandra . Dubey described Sachin Chauhan as being 'drunk'. Johan denied the allegations, telling police that the woman had asked to be woken up for a rickshaw ride to the train station. His . hotel guard, who the woman also alleges was trying to enter the room, . was also arrested, with both men facing a potential seven years in . prison if they are convicted of sexual harassment. The woman said that the manager was joined by another male, thought to be the security guard, in trying to open the door. She added: 'I shouted at them to stop harassing me but it continued.' After . the repeated attempts to enter the room, the woman said she jumped to a . balcony below her room before escaping down the buildings stairs. Having . run into the road seeking help, the woman said 'no one would stop', but . she eventually 'begged' an autorickshaw to take her to Rakabganj police station. Inquiries: Officers taking statements at the Hotel Agra Mahal yesterday . Treatment: An ambulance carrying the British tourist arrives at the district hospital . Horror: A British tourist was the victim of an alleged sexual assault in Agra, where the Taj Mahal is located . Magnet: Agra draws millions of tourists every year . She said that a man approached the driver and tried to make him bring the woman back to the hotel. She then jumped out of the vehicle and ran further before the driver returned and took her to the station. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are in touch with a British national and local authorities following an assault in Agra. 'They are now safe and we are offering consular assistance.' Following the brutal gang-rape and murder of an Indian student last year, the Indian Parliament has passed a tough new law under which rapists will be faced with a minimum sentence of 20 years, double the current sentencing. Convicts could also be faced with the death penalty if the victim dies during during or after the attack. Superintendent Dubey said yesterday that the British woman thought she 'could be raped or murdered' if she opened the door. He added: 'The woman panicked and leaned out of the window and screamed for help. 'When she saw that no help was . forthcoming, to save herself, the woman jumped from the window and . landed on the first floor balcony and ran down the stairs out of the . hotel and on to a tea stall nearby.' Attack: Five men suspected of gang-raping a Swiss tourist in central India last week . Outrage: A protester during a demonstration against the men who raped a student in December . The incident comes after a wave of . attacks in India, and on the same day that the Foreign Office updated . its advice to urge women travellers to be cautious in the country. Last week, a 39-year-old  Swiss tourist was gang-raped  by eight men in Datia,  Madhya Pradesh. In December, the fatal gang-rape of a woman on a bus in New Delhi led to mass protests demanding government action. In response, the government passed a . law increasing prison terms for rape and providing for the death penalty . in rape cases that result in death or coma. The Foreign Office advises women to avoid solo travel on public transport, especially at night. It adds: 'Reported cases of sexual . assault against women and young girls are increasing; recent sexual . attacks against female visitors in tourist areas and cities show foreign . women are also at risk.' The British High Commission in New Delhi said officials had spoken to the woman and were offering her consular assistance.","Woman was staying at Agra Mahal hotel when manager allegedly woke her .

"Sexual deviance, regardless of its truth, has already brought down Herman Cain. But Newt Gingrich is so far holding up stronger than his fallen rival. However now an ‘ex-mistress’ has told the National Enquirer that the GOP presidential candidate, who cheated on two previous wives, is a ‘hypocrite'. Anne Manning claims she performed a sex act on him in his Washington D.C. hotel room while he was still married to his first wife Jackie in 1977. Allegations: Anne Manning, left, claims she performed a sex act on Newt . Gingrich, right, in a hotel room while he was still married to his first . wife Jackie in 1977 . ‘He always talks about being big on family values but he doesn’t practice what he preaches,’ Ms Manning told the National Enquirer. ‘I wasn’t planning to say a word about him, but voters need to know what sort of man they’re being asked to support,’ the businesswoman added. Ms Manning, who was on his congressional campaign, claimed they did not have intercourse because then 'he could say he had not slept with me'. ‘If Newt acted in the way Anne alleged, his behaviour is consistent with sex addicts,’ sex addiction expert George Collins told the National Enquirer. Number three: In the mid-1990s, he began an affair with House of Representatives staffer Callista Bisek, who is 23 years his junior. They married in 2000 .

Many critics of the former House Speaker say he still has to convince doubters who say his personal past makes him unfit to become President. These details may been brought back to . light as part of a smear campaign from opponents of the man who could . take on Barack Obama for the presidency next year. He has said voters should look to the 'strong marriage' he has with his current wife Callista and consider the 'forgiveness' he sought from God. Mr Gingrich married his first wife Jackie Battley, his former high school geometry teacher, in 1962 when he was 19 years old and she was 26. Second wife: Mr Gingrich married Marianne Ginther in 1981, six months after his divorce with his previous spouse was finalised . They had two daughters, Kathy and Jackie. But in the spring of 1980, they split after he had an affair with Marianne Ginther.

"Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton told the German magazine Der Spiegel on Tuesday that she and her husband Bill were indeed 'deeply in debt' when they left the White House and blamed 'relentless persecution' by Republicans for her legal bills after his presidency. The claim has added fuel to the fire Clinton herself touched off last month when she claimed they were 'dead broke' after their time in the White House. The former first lady earns $200,000 or more every time she makes a public speech. The former president has earned a reported $104 million in speaking fees since he left the Oval Office behind him. The power couple has also raised more than $1 billion in political contributions for Democrats and their own foundation in the last two decades. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Stormy weather: Hillary Clinton met with French President Francois Hollande on Tuesday in Paris, as her Der Spiegel interview caused new headaches in Germany and the U.S. Hillary claimed that 'relentless persecution' by Republicans left her and her husband deep in debt to lawyers after he left the White House . Mrs. Clinton seemed tone deaf on Tuesday, taking a detour from her initial 'dead broke' claim and her subsequently softened claim that she was 'not truly well off.' 'You recently described your financial situation during the presidency of your husband Bill Clinton as dead broke,' Der Spiegel's Marc Hujer and Holger Stark reminded her. 'Well,' Clinton responded. when we came out of the White House, we were deeply in debt because of all the legal bills that we owed because of the relentless persecution of my husband and myself, and he had to work unbelievably hard to pay off every single penny of every debt we owed. And we did.' That 'persecution' was related to President Clinton's impeachment for lying under oath as an independent prosecutor probed his extramarital affair with a White House intern. But today, the interviewers said, 'you are multimillionaires. Your husband has earned $104 million with his speeches since 2001.' 'We are very grateful for where we are today,' she responded. 'But if you were to go back and look at the amount of money that we owed, we couldn't even get a mortgage on a house by ourselves. In our system he had to make double what he needed in order just to pay off the debt, and then to finance a house and continue to pay for our daughter's education.' Today the Clintons own a sprawling home in Chappaqua, New York and a lavish apartment in New York City, and summer in the tony Hamptons. Yet Mrs. Clinton said 'I do agree' with the magazine's premise that 'the growing gap between the rich and the poor is threatening democracy.' 'The average annual income of an American household is $22,296 (€16,397),' Der Spiegel told her. 'You earn up to $200,000 an hour for a speech. Can you understand if people are bothered by that?' 'Well, certainly, I can understand that,' she responded, 'but that's never been the crux of the concern in our country, because we've always had people who did better than other people. That's just accepted.' Hillary also parried America's national unease about sending a second Clinton to the White House, following two Bushes and a possible third in Jeb Bush. Dynasty? Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush could be the third Bush in the White House, and Hillary could be the second Clinton -- but she insists that Teddy Roosevelt and FDR didn't lead to an American monarchy . Republicans and Democrats alike have expressed concerns about the wisdom of formalizing a political dynasty that already exists in practice. 'Will the American democracy turn into a monarchy?' she was asked. 'We had two Roosevelts. We had two Adams,' she responded. 'It may be that certain families just have a sense of commitment or even a predisposition to want to be in politics. I ran for president, as you remember. I lost to somebody named Barack Obama, so I don't think there is any guarantee in American politics. My last name did not help me in the end.' 'Our system is open to everyone,' she added. 'It is not a monarchy in which I wake up in the morning and abdicate in favor of my son.' Clinton is already a presumptive favorite for Democrats in 2016. A Quinnipiac University poll published Tuesday showed her with the backing of 58 per cent of voters in a hypothetical Democratic primary race. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren came was a distant second with 11 per cent. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, came in second among a tightly packed Republican crowd with 10 percent, trailing Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul by one point.","Former secretary of state told Der Spiegel that 'legal bills that we owed because of the relentless persecution of my husband and myself' left them 'deeply in debt'

"Attacker: Martin Couture-Rouleau, 25, ran down the two soldiers in his car Monday morning. The government said he is a known radical . A radicalized Muslim convert ran down two soldiers in his car - killing one - in an apparent terror attack on Monday, before being shot dead by police. Martin Couture-Rouleau, 25, sped into the two young soldiers - one uniformed and one not - around 11.30am in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, not far from Montreal. After the impact he sped off, but was chased down by Canadian police, who shot him dead. Both soldiers survived the attack, however one died from his injuries in hospital early Tuesday. The fallen solider has been identified as Patrice Vincent, 53. The second soldier is recovering. A Canadian government spokesman confirmed that Couture-Rouleau, who describes himself as a recent convert online, was on a list of known radicals. One neighbor told reporters that the man had fallen in with extremist Muslims around a year ago. On social media websites, Couture-Rouleau posted polemics attacking Christianity, Western leaders and Israel. He also published images seemingly to glorify armed jihadist extremists, denigrating Westerners as 'kaffir', a derogatory Arabic term for non-believers. After he ran down the two men, Couture-Rouleau called 911 and boasted to operators that he had attacked in the name of Allah, the Toronto Sun reported. Eyewitnesses told the newspaper how during the police chase which followed, Couture-Rouleau rolled his car after hitting a spike striped put down by police. He landed upside down in a ditch. Scroll down for video . Planned attack: Police say that Martin Rouleau, 25, waited in the carpark for the soldiers for at least two hours before mowing them down and taking off, leading police on a high-speed chase . Police chase: Officers are pictured investigating the crash scene. Couture-Rouleau's grey car rolled over and landed in this ditch. According to witness accounts he crawled out and charged at police, who shot him . Weapon: Couture-Rouleau came at police with a knife before he was shot. This is believed to be the weapon, found near his overturned car . Scene: A knife is wedged in the ground where police shot and killed a motorist who had climbed out of his overturned car wielding a knife, in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, after two soldiers were hit by the motorist . Evidence: Police officers trawl the scene just hours after the showdown, which took place noon Monday . Police investigators take photos at the scene where the two soldiers were struck  in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec. One of two soldiers hit by a car  died of his injuries early Tuesday . They told how he emerged from the car with a long knife and charged at police - who then opened fire. One witness said: 'I heard [the police] shout several times, ""Get out of the car, get out of the car and raise your hands."" 'The man got out and charged towards the policewoman. Then that's when we heard seven gunshots, then the man was on the ground.' In a statement released shortly after the incident, a spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said: 'The individual who struck the two [Canadian Armed Forces] members with his car is known to federal authorities, including the Integrated National Security Enforcement Team. 'Federal authorities have confirmed that there are clear indications that the individual had become radicalized.' Earlier in the day, Randy Hoback, a member of Parliament for the ruling Conservative Party, referred in the House of Commons to unconfirmed reports of 'a possible terror attack against two members of the Canadian armed forces.' Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney and Transport Minister Lisa Thériault address reporters at a news conference in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, on Tuesday Oct. 21, 2014, after two soldiers were run down by a motorist . Road block: The spike strip used by police to stop the car lays next to a cruiser in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu . Scene: Martin Couture Rouleau, 25, of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, was shot and killed by police after he struck two members of the Canadian military with his car Monday in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu . 'In the name of Allah': Couture-Rouleau reportedly called 911 to boast about his attacks while on the run . Crime scene: This is the carpark where the two soldiers were hit. It serves several commercial properties, as well as a number of provincial, federal and military administrative offices . At the time, Harper said the reports were 'extremely troubling' but declined to give more details. A spokesman for the Surete du Quebec police force said they were investigating whether the soldiers had been specifically targeted. Police said Tuesday that Rouleau had been waiting in the carpark for at least two hours, according to CBC News. Witnesses have said they saw his car - a gold Nissan Altima - in the car park from about 9.15am. A least one of the soldiers was in uniform, police said. The Canadian government recently pledged six fighter jets to take part in the U.S.-led campaign against ISIS militants in Iraq. Canadian security officials have fretted for years about the potential threat of radicalized young men, especially those traveling abroad to join militant groups including Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. There was no immediate indication Rouleau had traveled abroad. Ray Boisvert, former assistant director for intelligence at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) spy agency, said he suspects Rouleau was a lone actor who would have been difficult for authorities to stop. 'It reflects what's going on in a very active threat environment. You have far too many targets and far too many active targets,' he said. The case bears some parallels to the murder in the UK last year of Lee Rigby, a member of the British Army who was run down then beheaded by two Muslim fanatics. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale rammed their car into Rigby as he walked down the street in the Woolwich suburb of London. They then hacked his head from his shoulders with a meat cleaver and delivered threatening messages, characterizing the murder as a revenge attack, to bystanders recording with their phones. Both were tried and convicted for the murder and are serving decades-long prison sentences.","Martin Couture-Rouleau, 25, smashed his car into two soldiers in Quebec on Monday .

"Australians attending next year's Gallipoli centenary Anzac Day commemorations have been warned by the government to be vigilant in the wake of increased terrorism threats. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has released preliminary advice on the risk facing travellers heading to Turkey for the event on the Gallipoli Peninsula in April. While there is currently no indication terrorist groups intend to attack Australians in Turkey, the department warns people should 'exercise a high degree of caution'. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, pictured giving a speech at the National Press Club in Canberra, has voiced her fears over a possible terrorist attack at next year's Gallipoli centenary Anzac Day commemorations . Australian visitors sllently mourn at the 99th anniversary of the Anzac Day in Canakkale, Turkey, last year . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Turkey was on the front line of the ongoing wars in Iraq and Syria. 'The security environment is volatile,' she said, in a statement. She said terrorists have been active in Turkey before and ISIL poses an extra threat to the region. However, the Gallipoli peninsular is far from Turkey's borders with Iraq and Syria.

Australian soldiers pay their respects during the ceremony celebrating the 99th anniversary of the Anzac Day in Canakkale last April . The Department of Veterans’ Affairs, who is managing events to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Anzac landings at Gallipoli, said that a spill-over from the Syrian conflict could lead to attacks against targets in Turkey, including Ankara, Istanbul or areas close to the Syrian border. Although they said there's no indication that terrorist groups have intentions to attack Australians or Australian interests in Turkey currently, there will still be tight security arrangements in place for the Anzac Day commemorations next year. Turkish authorities will screen all visitors on arrival, while all bags will be searched and prohibited items confiscated.","Travellers warned of dangers by Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade .

"Drinking three pints of beer – or three medium-sized glasses of wine – once a week permanently dulls the brain, according to a study. Researchers discovered that regular drinkers have to use almost 20 per cent more brain-power than normal to carry out simple tasks and find it progressively more difficult to concentrate. The three-year study at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain compared 26 ‘binge-drinking’ students – those who regularly drank a minimum of six units of alcohol, or around three pints, in one sitting at least once a week – with 31 others who did not regularly drink as much. Mine's a pint: Research showed that heavy drinkers' brains had to work harder to achieve the same result as those who do not regularly drink . Later, when sober, the students were asked to react to different flashing symbols. There was no measurable difference in speed or accuracy of response between the two groups, and no deterioration over time. However, brain-power measurements showed that ‘binge-drinkers’ had to  work harder to achieve the same result. Risks: Drinking beer regularly permanently dulls brain function . With the more sober group, peak brain . activity stayed  at about 18 microvolts while the drinkers started at 20 . microvolts in their first year and went up to 22 microvolts in their . third year. It suggests that young drinkers ‘experience anomalies in neural activity’ involved with attention and working memory, the researchers wrote in the journal Alcohol and Alcoholism. Emily Robinson, director of the campaign group Alcohol Concern, said: ‘This shows why we need to change the culture where it’s seen as the norm to drink excessively  at university. Risk: Too many alcoholic drinks can affect concentration as well as organ function . ‘Binge-drinking carries lots of risks in terms of the immediate safety of students, but also in terms of their future health and the likelihood of developing an alcohol problem later in life.’ But Paul McCormack, of Oxford Brookes University Students’ Union, said: ‘Learning at university is not limited to the classroom. 'While having a few drinks on a regular basis may dull your senses slightly, the gains far outweigh the disadvantages.’","Drinking beer and wine regularly permanently inhibits concentration .
Research showed that binge drinking affected both attention and memory ."
"Worlds collided in the nation's capital last night, as President Obama shared a meal with the likes of Kim Kardashian and Lindsay Lohan at the 98th annual White House Correspondents' Dinner. The president enjoyed a genial evening with the members of the press, thanking them for their time and dedication. Nothing was off limits during Washington’s night of levity, including the recent Secret Service scandal in Colombia, 'dog socialism', and the state of media today. And of course, he didn't shy away from the political arena. Scroll down for video . Comedian-in-chief: President Obama was in fine form Saturday night and delivered a comedy routine that left the audience in stitches. No one was safe from mockery, including the shamed Secret Service and likely GOP adversary Mitt Romney . Dazzling: First lady Michelle Obama was beaming at the dinner in a modified version of Naeem Khan's paisley organza ball gown from the Fall/Winter 2011 collection, while host Jimmy Kimmel, left, looked a little more sombre . A night to remember: Lindsay Lohan, left, managed to make it to the dinner, and Kim Kardashian, right, covered up in forest-green velvet for her evening with the president .

Effortless: The first lady laughed alongside host Jimmy Kimmel, left, and accessorised her Naeem Khan gown with good hoop earrings and a soft pink lip gloss . The president appeared in high . spirits as he began his comedic routine. ‘We gather during a historic . anniversary,’ he said. ‘Last year at this time, in fact on this very . weekend, we finally delivered justice to one of the world’s most . notorious individuals.’ That man wasn't Osama bin Laden - no, a picture of none other than Donald Trump flashed on the screen. Speaking of Trump, Obama invoked the birther debate by announcing that his mother was born in Kansas, his father was born in Kenya and he himself was born in Hawaii (with a wink to the crowd). He then thanked members of Congress, for taking a break from their ‘exhausting schedule of not passing any laws’ to show up for the dinner. Weeks after Sarah Palin co-hosted the Today show, Obama took a dig at Mama Grizzly and himself at the same time, asking the audience, 'What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? A pit bull is delicious!' Jabs at his likely GOP rival Mitt Romney came soon after. ‘I’m not going to attack any of the . Republican candidates - take Mitt Romney,’ the president deadpanned, . adding that the former Massachusetts governor would call the luxurious . Hilton ballroom 'a little fixer-upper.' He continued: '[Romney] and I actually have a lot in common… We both have degrees from Harvard. I have one, he has two.’ After a pause, he added: ‘What a snob.’ Four years ago, Mr Obama recalled, he was . locked in a tough primary fight with Hillary Rodham Clinton, now his . secretary of state. 'Now she can't stop drunk-texting me from Cartagena,' he . said, referring to their recent trip to the Summit of the Americas in . Colombia, where Clinton was photographed drinking a beer and dancing.

Animated: Actress Sofia Vergara flashed a large smile as she was talking to Kim Kardashian, left, and Kris Jenner, right . But the attacks were not just for his rivals on the other side of the political aisle, as Obama spent some time mocking his own appearance, noting how his hair has greyed in the four years since he took office, and displayed a photo of Morgan Freeman to illustrate how he'd look after another four years. Next up was a video satirising Mr . Romney’s highly politicised event of strapping his dog Seamus to the . roof while on home from a family vacation. The first lady was wearing a modified version of Naeem Khan’s paisley organza ball gown from the Fall/Winter 2011 collection (seen above). The version that went down the runway had a strap over the left shoulder. In the faux-political video, the . announcer hinted at what a horrible world it would be if 'socialist' first dog Bo Obama were allowed another four terms in office. 'America’s dogs can’t afford four more years of Obama - that’s 28 years for dogs.' The video . finished with the slogan: ‘I’m an American, and dog gone it, I ride on . the outside. (Paid for by the Wolf Pack of America).' Throughout the routine, Mrs Obama could be seen laughing at the dinner table. The first lady was wearing a modified version of Naeem Khan’s one-shouldered paisley organza ball gown from the Fall/Winter 2011 collection. The version that went down the runway had a twisted strap over the left shoulder, but Mrs Obama seemed to prefer a dress that better displayed her décolletage. She accessorised the look with detailed gold hoop earrings and a loosely-waved bob, as well as a large cocktail ring worn on her left hand. The first lady also elected to wear a bright pink lipstick to match the colours of her gown. Earlier, the president gave a knowing . nod to several instances . of 'hot microphone' instances, lampooning himself in a monologue, asking . who the Kardashians are, and why exactly they're famous. 'What am I doing here,' he asked off stage. 'I'm opening for Jimmy Kimmel and telling knock-knock jokes to Kim Kardashian.' A toilet flush was then heard just before the commander-in-chief was formally introduced. The . crack drew a thumbs up from former Pennsylvania Sen Rick Santorum, who . dropped out of the presidential primary campaign earlier this month. Santorum had called Obama a snob for encouraging young Americans to . attend college. But Mr Obama touched on serious . themes as well, remembering The New York Times' Anthony Shadid and Marie . Colvin of the Sunday Times of London who died while covering the . uprising in Syria. 'Never forget that our country depends on you to help protect our freedom, our democracy and our way of life,' he said. Then he returned to the lighter side: 'I have to get the Secret Service home in time for their new curfew.' The president then passed the podium on to ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, who he noted got his start on a programme called The Man Show. ‘In Washington, that’s what we call a congressional hearing on contraception,’ he said. Glamour girls: Both Arianna Huffington, left, of the Huffington Post, and NBC's Ann Curry, right, opted for bright colours and sleeves .

Blonde ambition: Sen John McCain's daughter Meghan McCain, left, and news anchor Diane Sawyer, right . Newsmakers: ABC News Global Affairs anchor Christiane Amanpour and her husband, James Rubin, left, and living legend Barbara Walters, right . Kimmel began joking straight out of . the gate, saying: ‘It’s an honour to be here. Mr President, remember . when the country rallied around you in the hopes of a better tomorrow? 'That was hilarious. That was your . best one yet. There’s a term for guys like President Obama. Probably not . two terms, but there is.’ No one was safe from the wry jokes of the outspoken host of Jimmy Kimmel Live. He . poked fun at everyone from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ('I think . you’re misunderstanding New Jersey’s slogan. It’s not the Olive Garden . State') to Newt Gingrich (‘It’s great to see the Gingriches here, . because that means the check cleared') to Arianna Huffington (You deserve [the Pulitzer Prize], Arianna.  There's no one else out there linking to the kinds of hard-hitting journalism that HuffPo is linking to every single day). He also picked up on the Secret . Service prostitution scandal in Colombia, saying he told the Secret . Service that for $800 he wouldn't joke about them, 'but they only . offered 30.' 'If this had . happened on President Clinton's watch, you can damn well bet those . Secret Service agents would have been disciplined with a very serious . high five,' Kimmel said. Among those who attended Saturday . night's dinner were former Secretary of State Colin Powell, the cast of . the hit TV show 'Modern Family,' singer John Legend, actor George . Clooney, Army Chief of Staff Gen Ray Odierno, House Majority Leader . Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, director Steven Spielberg, and actress Zooey . Deschanel.

"Documentary victory was quite literally snatched from the jaws of defeat when a grizzly bear tried to munch a cameraman's new gadget and it survived with the footage intact. Chris Weston, a British wildlife photographer, watched in horror as a flashing light on his expensive new camera caught the attention of a 500lb bear in the Katmai Peninsula, Alaska.

"A man walks into a pet shop... and a comedy classic is born. Monty Python’s Dead Parrot sketch has been voted the troupe’s greatest piece of all time. A man buys a dead parrot and takes it back to complain - only to discover the pet shop owner refuses to admit there is anything wrong with the bird. It hardly sounds funny, but performed by John Cleese and Michael Palin it is regarded by Monty Python fans as one of the greatest comedy sketches of all time. And it appears the nation agrees. Monty Python's Dead Parrot sketch has been voted the troupe's greatest piece of all time . The sketch - first aired almost 45 years ago on December 7, 1969 has topped a poll of 2,000 British adults. People were asked to select their top sketch from a long list of more than 35 Python scenes. The pet shop scene, which features Cleese as an exasperated customer trying to get his money back from Palin, who is a stubborn pet salesman, was voted the most popular Python moment by 45 per cent. Second place with 28 per cent went to The Lumberjack Song, which was released as a single in 1975, while the top three was completed by The Ministry of Silly Walks (23 per cent) – a sketch which sees Cleese striding in and out of meetings in a series of government-approved walks. Second place with 28 per cent went to The Lumberjack Song, which was released as a single in 1975 . The troupe are currently on stage for their Monty Python Live (Mostly) reunion at London’s O2 arena. The survey has been commissioned to tie in with the last show which will be screened on TV channel Gold on Sunday July 20th. The findings also reveal some regional differences with Londoners the most likely to find Monty Python funny (81 per cent), compared to those in the North East (69 per cent). There was a surge of popularity for the Dead Parrot sketch in the East Midlands with more than half (55 per cent) voting it their top Python moment, compared to the national average of 45 per cent. The top three was completed by The Ministry of Silly Walks (23 per cent) - a sketch which sees Cleese striding in and out of meetings in a series of government-approved walks . The Lumberjack Song was particularly popular in Northern Ireland (33 per cent) and Scotland (34 per cent), compared to the national average of 28 per cent. Those living in East Anglia (28 per cent) and Wales (27 per cent) were particularly tickled by The Ministry for Silly Walks, compared to the national average of 23 per cent. The Monty Python troupe announced last November they were reuniting for a one-off stage show, but after tickets quickly sold out an extra nine dates were added. It is the first time in 40 years that members John Cleese, 74, Terry Gilliam, 73, Eric Idle, 71, Terry Jones, 72, and Michael Palin have appeared together on a UK stage. Palin, 71,  has said the July 20 show will be the last time the five stars work together, adding there were 'absolutely no plans to do any more shows after that'.","First aired 45 years ago on December 7, 1969 sketch has topped a poll .

"The family of a woman murdered on Valentine’s Day by her boyfriend say they have been caused additional pain and suffering after being told that the SpongeBob SquarePants headstones that they paid $26,000 to have built are ‘inappropriate’ for the Cincinnati cemetery where their daughter is buried. Sgt. Kimberly Walker, 28, was found dead in a Colorado Springs, Colo., hotel room on Valentine’s Day and her boyfriend, also a soldier, has been charged with first-degree murder. To stand as a tribute to their lost loved one, the Walker family decided it would be fitting to erect two 7,000-pound SpongeBob SquarePants monuments at Walker’s graveside in the historic Spring Grove Cemetery. Scroll down for video . Kimberly Walker, right, was found strangled earlier this year, she was a massive fan of SpongeBob SquarePants and so her family decided that two 6ft monuments of the kid's favorite would be a fitting tribute . Each SpongeBob wears a military uniform, one in an Army uniform for Kimberly and the other in a Navy uniform for twin sister Kara. They also have an American flag on one sleeve and the No. 24 for Kimberly¿s favorite racecar driver Jeff Gordon on the other . According to Deborah Walker, Kimberly’s mother, her daughter loved everything to do with the cartoon character and had countless SpongeBob-branded items including shower curtains. ‘SpongeBob went in her casket before we laid her in the ground,’ she told WLWT.com. After receiving approval from a cemetery employee in March, the family decided on the design for the SpongeBob monuments and paid 10 percent of the price for the two $13,000 each statues upfront. The Walkers also purchased six plots together at the cemetery to provide the required space to erect them. Mom Deborah Walker has said that the family want to honor their dead daughter with the SpongeBob statues, while Kimberly's twin sister Kara has described them as 'the greatest thing in the cemetery' The SpongeBob monuments were erected on Oct 10, but the next day  bosses contacted the family to say that their design was 'inappropriate' for such a historic cemetery . ‘They stand 6 feet tall and he’s 4 feet wide and he’s on a platform of eight inches, so it makes him 6 feet 8 inches tall,’ said Ms Walker. Each SpongeBob wears a military uniform, one in an Army uniform for Kimberly and the other in a Navy uniform for twin sister Kara, who is an IT Specialist in the U.S. Navy. The monuments also have an American flag on one sleeve and the No. 24 for Kimberly’s favorite Nascar driver Jeff Gordon on the other. ‘I thought it was the greatest thing in the cemetery. I even told the people there that I think this is the best monument I’ve ever seen. It’s the best headstone in the cemetery and they all agreed. It came out really nice,’ said sister Kara. The monuments were finally installed at the cemetery on October 10, but the next day cemetery officials informed the Walker family that the twin SpongeBobs were inappropriate and had to be removed. Kimberly's boyfriend Sgt. Montrell Mayo, right, was charged with first-degree murder following her death in February, while left is the SpongeBob monument decked out as a tribute to Kara Walker . Spring Grove has apologized for the misunderstanding and has offered to pay for something more in keeping with the surroundings, but the family wants to keep SpongeBob . Spring Grove has accepted responsibility for the misunderstanding and promised to work with the family to design at alternative which they hope will be more in keeping with the historic cemetery. ‘Spring Grove is deeply sorry for the issues involving the monument the Walker family recently purchased. Although the family chose a design with the guidance of a Spring Grove employee, unfortunately the monument did not fit within Spring Grove Cemetery guidelines,’ President and CEO Gary Freytag told WLWT in a written statement. ‘As an historic cemetery, we must constantly balance the needs of families who have just suffered a loss with the thousands of families who have entrusted us in the past. 'We are working with the Walker family and are committed to design a solution, at our expense, that will properly memorialize Kimberly, within the context of Spring Grove’s historic landscape and guidelines.’ Cemetery officials and the Walkers are scheduled to meet later this week to reach a resolution, but the family are upset that Spring Grove is going back on the agreement made in March to honor their daughter with twin SpongeBob monuments. Kimberley's twin sister Kara, who is an IT Specialist in the U.S. Navy, poses beside the SpongeBob monument that celebrates her sister and is dressed in army fatigues . Kimberly Walker was a massive fan of SpongeBob SquarePants, left, and Nascar driver Jeff Gordon . ‘I feel like, and we all feel like, SpongeBob should stay there. We bought the plots, all six of them. We put the monuments there, we did what we had to do and they said they could provide that service to us,’ said Ms Walker. Following Walker’s murder in February, her boyfriend Sgt. Montrell Mayo was charged with first-degree murder. The . arrest affidavit states that Mayo, a Fort Carson soldier, admitted to . his supervisor in a phone call ‘I think I killed my girlfriend’ after . the two had an altercation at a hotel in Colorado Springs . The . affidavit states that Mayo told his supervisor that Walker threatened . his career, then he hit her with a glass and doesn’t remember anything . after that . Police who responded to the scene found Walker’s body and blood on the bed sheets, clothing and sink. An autopsy report states that Walker was strangled.","Sgt.

The incredible images document spectacular literary institutions from around the globe, dating from modern times right back to the 15th century. British academic Dr James Campbell visited more than 80 libraries in 20 countries for his new book The Library, the first complete history of library buildings ever to be written. Scroll down for video . Epic tome: New book The Library features stunning pictures of libraries around the globe, including the The Tripitaka Koreana at the Haeinsa Temple in South Korea . Quiet please: The grand Mafra Palace Library, in Mafra, Portugal, is just one of the many libraries featured in Dr James Campbell's new book . Shhhh: The Codrington Library was built to house the thousands of books at All Souls College in Oxford long before Kindles and iPads existed . The fabulous photos in the book, published by Thames and Hudson, show the wealth that people were prepared to lavish on libraries in a world where knowledge was power. The volume is the result of five years of meticulous research by Dr Campbell, an expert in architecture at Cambridge University who spent three years travelling the world visiting each of the libraries alongside photographer Will Pryce. The 320-page tome features libraries of all sizes from the world's largest - the Library Of Congress in Washington - to the tiny late medieval library of Trinity Hall in Cambridge. The oldest library featured in the £48 . book which has survived with its fitting intact is the Malatestiana . Biblioteca in Cesena in Italy, which dates back to 1452. Simply stunning: Academic Dr Campbell visited more than 80 libraries in 20 countries including Biblioteca Joanina, in Coimbra, Portugal . A bookworm's dream: Even the most ardent reader would struggle to get through the six storeys of books kept at the George Peabody Library, Baltimore . The big read: Biblioteca Malatestiana in Cesena, Italy is one of the many beautiful libraries to feature in the book, while the grand Philosophical Hall, at Strahov Abbey, in Prague, Czech Republic adorns the cover of Dr Cambell's tome . Among the most opulent is the library in Melk in Austria which is decorated with gold leaf with every volume rebound to match its grand surroundings. Dr Campbell, 45, says that his favourite is the library at Admont Abbey in Austria, the largest monastery library in the world. 'Public libraries are currently under threat and everyone is discussing whether it could spell the end for libraries,' he said. 'Personally I love them and I wanted to show what an amazing history they have. 'People's perceptions of libraries are largely based on their own experiences of them, so most have no idea what a Roman or medieval library looks like. 'I wanted to bring all these fascinating buildings together. Picking favourites: Dr Campbell, 45, says that his favourite is the library at Admont Abbey in Austria, the largest monastery library in the world . Knowledge is power: Bomb-damaged books now stored safely in the chapter library, Noyon Cathedral, France . Works of art: Both the Altenburg Abbey Library, in Altenburg, Austria and the Abbey of St Gall Library, in St Gallen, Switzerland are examples of libraries not only being used to store books, but also as spectacular works of art and symbols of cultural importance in their own right . 'Libraries have been held in such high esteem for hundreds of years and have often had a huge amount of money spent on them for different reasons. 'For some it was a case of personal pride while for others their library was a symbol of cultural importance. 'Some libraries are a place to store books while some are sheer works of art. 'Libraries are like living rooms in cities - warm places that anyone can go to to work and to learn - they are very egalitarian. 'In contrast, the internet, the main threat to public libraries, is quite undemocratic because to access it you need a computer and a connection. 'A lot of people think books are on their way out but interestingly there are more books being printed now than ever before. 'Public libraries might be being closed in Europe but in other parts of the world like China they are being built. 'In fact, one of the first things any country wanting to establish itself does is build a national library. 'My hope is that this book will becomes the one people will reach for for information on the history of libraries for many years to come.' The Library is published by Thames and Hudson and costs £48. Modern literature: Many of the buildings featured in The Library are hundreds of years old, although the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, France is a more modern example having been completed in 1996. Big demand: Dr Campbell says that although public libraries are being closed in Europe but in other parts of the world they are being built, including the ultra-modern National Library of China in Beijing .","New book features stunning photographs of the world's greatest libraries - built long before Kindles were invented .

"Carolina Panthers star Greg Hardy will be leaving the team as a result of a domestic abuse incident he was involved in this past May. 'The Panthers have announced that DE Greg Hardy will take a voluntary leave of absence,' the team said in a statement earlier today. This comes two months after Hardy, 25, was convicted by a judge in Charlotte, North Carolina of beating, strangling and threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend, Nicki Holder. Scroll down for video . Gone: The Carolina Panthers announced today that Greg Hardy (above) would be taking a 'voluntary leave of absence' Convicted: Even though Hardy (seen above leaving a courtroom) was charged by a judge in July for a domestic abuse incident, he will still collect his salary . Despite all of this, he will still collect his salary for the year which, according to NBC Sports, is roughly $770,000 a week. 'I understand that I need to step away from football right now and take care of this legal matter,' Hardy said in a statement. 'I am entitled to due process and my day in court, and that’s where my focus should be.' The Panthers had originally agreed to wait to take action until Hardy had a jury trial regarding the incident in May. His previous conviction was the result of a bench trial. Miss Holder told police that Hardy choked her, slammed her against a bathtub, threw her to the floor and threatened to kill her after a fight at his Charlotte condo. Horrific incident: Hardy's ex Nicki Holder (above with the football player) claims he beat, strangled, and threatened to kill her this past May . This all comes as the league is under heavy scrutiny in the wake of two abuse scandals involving stars Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. Many are upset with the punishments these two received, feeling the NFL was too lenient. Video of Rice punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer went public last Monday, and Peterson was indicted on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child on Friday for an incident in which he hit his son with a switch back in May. Rice has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL and had his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens, while Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings last Sunday, has now been suspended by the team.","The Carolina Panthers announced this afternoon that defensive end Greg Hardy would be taking a 'voluntary leave of absence' from the team .

"The Department of Defense announced Thursday a program that will allow undocumented immigrants to enter the U.S. military. The new rule applies only to those who qualify for the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, which gives immigrants who came to the country with their parents at least by 16 a path to citizenship. The Pentagon's program will be capped at 1,500 recruits per year, reports the Military Times. Path to citizenship: The Department of Defense announced Thursday a program that will allow undocumented immigrants to enter the U.S. military . The announcement is an expansion on an existing program that already allows foreign nationals with exceptional skills like rare foreign languages to serve. Dubbed Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI), the program is targeted at 'immigrants with language skills critical to national security, such as Arabic, Chinese, Pashto or Persian' according to the Military Times. One insider revealed that, within the 1.2 million and 2.1 million people eligible for DAVA, it's unclear how many would have the in demand language skills to make the cut. 'These are kids who entered the country at a fairly young age and have basically grown up in the United States, so the limit of their language talents would probably be the language that they received at home,' the insider told the Military Times. The most common language at home for these immigrants is, of course, Spanish and not a Pashto or Persian and the like. DACA was hailed by immigration advocates as a good interim fix to a larger problem of what to do with the more than 11 million immigrants thought to be living in the country illegally. Since the program's launch, those advocates have pushed Obama to do more for a larger group of immigrants. DACA is open to immigrants who came to the United States before they were 16 years old, were younger than 31 on June 15, 2012, and had been in the country since at least June 15, 2007, and have no criminal history. They also must be in school, have graduated from high school or earned a GED certificate or served in the military. Republican lawmakers have derided the program as 'backdoor amnesty.'

"The Shooter, unmasked: The Navy SEAL who shot dead Osama Bin Laden will sit down for his first television interview next month, in a two-part special on Fox News. Above, the shirt the shooter war during Operation Neptune's Spear on display at the National September 11th Museum and Memorial . One of the greatest mysteries in American military history will be solved next month, when Fox News will air an interview with the Nacy SEAL who shot dead Osama Bin Laden. The identity of the SEAL Team 6 member called 'The Shooter' was fiercely guarded in the aftermath of the May 2011 raid on Bin Laden's Abbottabad, Pakisatan compound, fearing the SEAL could be targeted by al-Qaeda as retribution. But he has since retired and is apparently ready to take off his mask of anonymity to details the events leading up to and during Operation Neptune's Spear. According to a Fox News press release, the two-part special The Man Who Killed Usama Bin Laden will air Tuesday November 11 and Wednesday November 12 from 10-11pm ET. The interview will be conducted by Washington Correspondent Peter Doocy. 'Revealing his identity and speaking out publicly for the first time, the Navy SEAL, also known as “The Shooter,” will share his story of training to be a member of America’s elite fighting force and explain his involvement in Operation Neptune Spear, the mission that killed Bin Laden,' the press release states. 'The documentary will provide an extensive, first-hand account of the mission, including the unexpected crash of one of the helicopters that night and why SEAL Team 6 feared for their lives. It will also touch upon what was taking place inside the terrorist compound while President Obama and his cabinet watched from the White House.' It's unclear whether the Shooter's identity will be protected in anyway, or if he will both appear on the camera and reveal his real name. 9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden was shot dead at his Abbottabad, Pakistan compound in May 2011 . Above, the Abbottabad compound where Bin Laden lived before his death. For the three years after the raid, the Shooter's identity has been kept a secret for fear he could be targeted by al-Qaeda or other terrorist networks once loyal to Bin Laden . Fox says he will also share what it was like to confront Bin Laden and what happened when the terrorist took his final breath. Also included in the special will be footage of the ceremony in which the Shooter donated the shirt he wore during the raid to the National September 11 Memorial Museum earlier this year. While the shooter's identity has remained a secret in the three year's since Bin Laden's assassination, a few details have emerged about his life from an interview he gave to Esquire magazine last year. Now retired, it was revealed the special-forces solider has suffered a breakdown in his marriage and is so concerned about being identified that he refused to meet families of 9/11 victims to preserve his anonymity, said the New York Post. In an interview with Esquire magazine in February 2013, the shooter described in extraordinary detail the heart-stopping two minutes that changed the course of history. In the Esquire interview The Shooter reveals that once they were given their mission, the female CIA agent - portrayed by Jessica Chastain's Maya in Zero Dark Thirty - told the team that bin Laden was '100 per cent on the third floor' of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. 'We got him,' she told us. 'This is him. This is my life's work. I'm positive.' Once he locked eyes on his target, the SEAL remembers being surprised at his appearance. Bin Laden was much taller than he expected him to be - taller than any of their guys, and skinny with a short beard and shaved head. He was holding his wife Amal in front of him as a shield and though The Shooter could see exactly what was going on through night vision goggles, bin Laden was in total darkness and could hear but not see. Hearts in mouth: President Obama, with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and vice president Joe Biden, watched the raid unfold in front of their eyes back in Washington D.C. He also said he feared she might try to blow them up. He added: ‘I don’t know if she’s got a vest and she’s being pushed to martyr them both. 'I'm just looking at him from right here [he moves his hand out from his face about ten inches]. He's got a gun on a shelf right there, the short AK he's famous for. And he's moving forward. I don't know if she's got a vest and she's being pushed to martyr them both. He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow himself up]. 'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! Same place. 'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath. 'And I remember as I watched him breathe out the last part of air, I thought: Is this the best thing I've ever done, or the worst thing I've ever done? This is real and that's him. Holy sh**. 'His forehead was gruesome. It was split open in the shape of a V. I could see his brains spilling out over his face.' The Shooter also says that the night before the raid, all the members of Team Six wrote letters to their loved ones - fully believing they would die in the mission to take down bin Laden. He described how he sat on his bed writing a letter to his kids to be delivered on the case of his death, 'something for them to read when they are 35'.","The man who shot the 9/11 mastermind will give his first televised interview next month on Fox News .

"Hillary Clinton has said she was obliged to defend an accused rapist out of professional duty when she was a lawyer in the 1970s - a case in which she was ready to discredit the 12-year-old victim. She even intimated that she knew the accused was guilty by revealing her shock that he passed a lie detector test. Mrs Clinton was given the case in 1975 when she ran the University of Arkansas’ legal aid clinic. The accused was Thomas Alfred Taylor, 41. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Retort: Hillary Clinton said she was obligated to defend an accused rapist in 1975 . Last month an audio recording emerged of an interview Mrs Clinton gave in the mid-1980s in which she chuckled several times as she described how she helped set the accused free. The recording drew fierce criticism from the victim, who is now 52. Mrs Clinton has now spoken about the case for the first time, telling Mumsnet that it was her duty to defend the accused. She said: ‘When I was a 27-year-old attorney doing legal-aid work at the law school where I taught in Fayetteville, Arkansas, I was appointed by the local judge to represent a criminal defendant accused of rape. I asked to be relieved of that responsibility, but I was not, and I had a professional duty to represent my client to the best of my ability, which I did. ‘When you’re a lawyer you often don’t have the choice to choose who you will represent, and by the very nature of criminal law there will be those who you represent that you won’t approve of. ‘But at least in our system you have an obligation, and once I was appointed, I fulfilled that obligation.’ Mrs Clinton (then Rodham), pictured in her 20s when she was at Wellesley College . The audio recording in which Mrs Clinton laughs about the case was published on YouTube by the Washington Free Beacon. She is heard chuckling as she describes how her client beat a lie detector case. She said: ‘I had him take a polygraph, which he passed – which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.’ She also appeared to find the fact that a crime lab accidentally threw away bloodied underwear funny – it was DNA evidence potentially linking Taylor to the crime. Court documents show that Mrs Clinton's case was to be based around discrediting the victim. She wrote: 'I have also been told by an expert in child psychology that children in early adolescence tend to exaggerate or romanticize sexual experiences and that adolescents in disorganized families, such as the complainant’s, are even more prone to exaggerate behavior.' However, in the end, the missing evidence meant the case against Taylor collapsed. In the end he pleaded guilty to a lesser offence. Clinton said: 'Got him off with time served in the county jail, he’d been in the county jail for about two months.' After hearing the recording, the victim, who has not been named, told The Daily Beast: ‘Hillary Clinton took me through hell. I realize the truth now, the heart of what you’ve done to me. And you are supposed to be for women? You call that [being] for women, what you done to me? And I heard you on tape laughing.’ Hillary Rodham (centre), pictured when she was a lawyer for the Rodino Committee, bringing impeachment charges against President Richard Nixon in the Judiciary Committee hearing room at the U.S. Capitol in 1974 in Washington, DC. Mrs Clinton's book 'Hard Choices', meanwhile, is on track to be one of the year's top nonfiction books despite another slip in sales. Nielsen BookScan says 'Hard Choices' sold 26,000 copies during its third week of publication. Clinton's memoir about her years as secretary of state was published June 10 and sold more than 80,000 copies the first week and nearly 50,000 the second week. The numbers don't include e-book sales, which comprise around 30 percent of the overall market. 'Hard Choices' has been the No. 1-selling nonfiction hardcover on The New York Times' list for three straight weeks but has slipped on Amazon.com, ranking No. 57 as of Thursday night. Clinton's 'Living History' was published in 2003 and sold more than 1 million copies. She is expected to run for president in 2016.","Hillary Clinton said she had an obligation to defend an accused rapist .

"A Washington Redskins fan called the police after producers of The Daily Show set up a tense encounter between a group of the team's supporters and Native Americans activists. Kelli O'Dell, 56, ran out of the room in tears after the heated confrontation that took place during filming of the yet-to-air episode at the Dupont Circle Hotel in Washington D.C. The former teacher described how she was accused of 'psychologically damaging' Native American children and claims was 'cut off' every time she tried to speak. Scroll down for video . The Redskins fans signed up to appear on The Daily Show, presented by Jon Stewart, (pictured) believing they had the opportunity to defend their team's name, but were instead confronted by Native Americans . The loyal followers signed up for the dedicated segment of Comedy Central show, presented by Jon Stewart, believing they had the opportunity to defend their team's name, in light of recent controversy. According to The Washington Post, they were led into a room and were initially interviewed by the show's reporter Jason Jones. However, they were interrupted when the Native Americans, who had been hiding in a separate room, walked in mid-way through their discussion. They included members of the comedy group 1491 - who were said to have been flown in especially for the awkward confrontation. Jones allegedly said: 'Wouldn't it be great if you guys had a conversation'. He then pulled out bottles of beer and chicken wings, and then stepped aside. Ms O'Dell, 56, said she 'felt trapped' in the situation and ran away in tears after it became too much for her. Two days later she called 911 to explain what had happened - but the authorities told her no crime had been committed. She told The Post: 'This goes way beyond mocking. Poking fun is one thing, but that's not what happened.' The tense encounter took place at the Dupont Circle Hotel in Washington D.C. during filming for the yet-to-air episode of the Comedy Central show . She has asked producers of the show to leave her out when it is aired, but is not sue whether they will comply. 'It was disingenuous. The Native Americans accused me of things that were so wrong. I felt in danger. I didn't consent to that. I am going to be defamed,' she added. Another fan, Amanda Blackhorse, said the situation had left her feeling 'dehumanized'. Brian Dorch, said he asked whether in advance whether they were going to come face-to-face with Native Americans. He told paper that he was assured the panel with the Native Americans was planned for another date. One of the Native Americans, Bobby Wilson, said: 'It didn’t seem strange or unfair on our end, considering that each of us has always been confronting racism on this level.' A federal trademark board ruled in June that the Washington Redskins nickname is 'disparaging of Native Americans' and that the team's trademark protections should be canceled, a decision that applies new financial and political pressure on the team to change its name. The Redskins quickly announced that they would appeal and fight to keep their name. Yesterday, during The Redskin's game against the Philadelphia Eagles, a commercial for an up and coming episode of South Park was aired. During the clip one of the characters, Eric Cartman, runs a business under the Washington Redskins name - seemingly highlighting the the creator's negative opinion of the name. The cartoon version of the Redskins owner Dan Snyder tells Cartman to stop using the name 'in the name of decency.'

"Fears: The Government says thousands of girls and women in Britain are forced into marriages every year . Teenage girls who fear they are being taken abroad to enter into a forced marriage are escaping by putting metal spoons in their underwear, a charity has revealed. Karma Nirvana, a Derby-based campaign group which supports victims of forced marriage, advises girls to use a spoon, or any other metal object, to set off detectors at the airport and separate themselves from parents. The charity says a number of girls have used the tactic to avoid being taken overseas and entered into a life of servitude. Last week, the Government warned that . thousands of schoolgirls are at risk of being sent away to enter into . forced marriages during the summer holidays. The . Foreign Office's Forced Marriage Unit gave support for 1,485 cases up . to December 2012, although it is feared many more go unreported. Around . 400 of these were reported int he three months up to the end of August. More than a third were under the age of 17 and more than 80 per cent were female. Speaking . to the AFP news agency, Natasha Rattu, Karma Nirvana's operations . manager, said that when worried youngsters ring the charity's helpline, . 'if they don't know exactly when it may happen or if it's going to . happen, we advise them to put a spoon in their underwear. 'When they go through security, it will highlight this object in a private area and, if 16 or over, they will be taken to a safe space where they have that one last opportunity to disclose they're being forced to marry.' Trick: Having a metal spoon on their person is being used as a last-minute tactic to set off airport security by girls to escape their parents . Doctors, teachers and airport staff are among those being asked to remain vigilant to the possibility of young girls being taken away during the summer break. Of the cases that the FMU handles, almost half relate to forced marriages in Pakistan. Other countries where girls are sent include Bangladesh, India, Somalia, Turkey, Iraq and Iran. The oldest case was a woman aged 71 and the youngest just two-years-old. A victim, whose identity was protected by Essex Police, told AFP that her father forced her into a marriage in India, after threatening to find her and kill her if she tried to run away. 'I was shipped off with a total stranger. That night I was raped by my husband and this abuse continued for about eight and half years of my life,' she said. She later escaped.","Campaign group Karma Nirvana often advises girls to employ tactic .

"Men who appeared in a video purporting to show 'Egypt's first gay wedding' were arrested and 'tested' for homosexuality. Officials subsequently said that they'd 'tested negative for homosexuality'. Precisely what the test involved hasn't been revealed, but it's thought to be an intrusive anal examination. Scroll down for video .

The video shows one man being given a ring, followed by shouts of delight from those watching. According to one report, the video's title was misleading, because what actually happened was that the man was given a silver ring as a birthday present. However, at the end the camera does linger briefly on a cake decorated with two men standing side by side. The men were not arrested on suspicion of homosexuality, because being gay is not illegal in Egypt. However, 'debauchery' is against the law, and it was for this that the men were detained on Saturday.

However, debauchery is against the law, and it was for this that the men were detained on Saturday .

Earlier this year an Egyptian court convicted four men of committing 'homosexual acts' and sentenced them to up to eight years in prison. Police arrested the men for holding parties they say involved homosexual acts and where they found women's clothes and makeup. Three of the four received eight years while one received three years with hard labour.

"The cake was iced, the sandwiches made and the balloons blown up and hanging from the ceiling.

"In a scathing attack on the $40 million settlement handed down to the Central Park 5 - at the expense of taxpayers - Donald Trump has called the payout a 'disgraceful' and 'ridiculous' result owing to the 'incompetence' of the New York City justice system. Writing an opinion piece for The New York Daily News on Saturday, the real estate mogul - who has long advocated the five then-teenagers receive the death penalty for the brutal rape and bashing of an investment banker in Central Park in 1989 - said that even though the men had been exonerated, the $40 million settlement was overblown. 'Forty million dollars is a lot of money for the taxpayers of New York to pay when we are already the highest taxed city and state in the country,' he wrote in the paper. 'The recipients must be laughing out loud at the stupidity of the city ... These young men do not exactly have the pasts of angels.' The five black and Hispanic defendants - Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and Kharey Wise - were aged between 14 and 16 when they found guilty in 1990 for the horrific attack on Trisha Meili, 28, who had gone for a run in the park. Settlement: (left to right) Korey Wise, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, and Yusef Salaam in 2012 in New York City. The men have settled for $40 million for their wrongful conviction for the rape of a 28-year-old woman in Central Park in 1989. Donald Trump has called the payout 'a disgrace' She was found in brush with a serious head injury, having lost 75 percent of the blood from her body and with no recollection of what happened. Scathing: Donald Trump says the $40 million Central Park 5 settlement is 'disgraceful' and shows the 'stupidity of the city' Alleged police brutality forced false confessions from the five teens. They served six to 13 years in prison before their convictions were thrown out in 2002 because DNA evidence that was dug up showed Matias Reyes, a convicted killer and rapist, had committed the crime and acted alone. At the time of their trial, the men argued the DNA would have triggered a not-guilty verdict but that the evidence was ignored. Reyes, already in prison for other charges, admitted to attacking Trisha Meili, who was in a coma for 12 days and suffered permanent damage. The five sued police and prosecutors for $250 million. On Friday, 25 years after the attack, the city agreed to give the five a settlement 'in the ball park' of $40 million, which was seen as a symbol of the failure of the justice system. 'My opinion on the settlement of the Central Park Jogger case is that it’s a disgrace,' Trump wrote in his piece. 'A detective close to the case, and who has followed it since 1989, calls it “the heist of the century''.' 'One thing we know is that the amount of time, energy and money that has been spent on this case is unacceptable. 'The justice system has a lot to answer for, as does the City of New York regarding this very mishandled disaster.' 'As citizens and taxpayers, we deserve better than this.' The agreed deal, which must still be approved by the city comptroller, averages out at roughly $1 million for each year of imprisonment for the five men. That means that Kharey Wise, who spent 13-years in prison, will be the largest single payout New York City has made in a wrongful conviction case. The other four men all served around seven years in prison. The men are all in their late 30s or early 40s now and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was said to be keen to have the case settled. This was in direct contrast to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg who argued the original $250 million suit was too high because authorities acted in good faith. Arrest: In this April 22, 1989 file photo, Yusef Salaam, 15, second from left, and Raymond Santana, 14, right, are led from the 24th Precinct by a detective after their arrest in connection with the rape and severe beating of a woman jogging in Central Park .

New York on October 21, 2002 . Indeed, according to the New York Times, the city's Law Department backed this opinion at the time. 'The case is not about whether the teens were wrongly convicted,' a department spokeswoman said. 'It’s about whether prosecutors and police deliberately engaged in misconduct.' The attack on 28-year-old investment banker Trisha Meili occurred on April 19, 1989. It was one of the most notorious crimes in New York City history and it mesmerized the nation, serving as a lurid symbol of the city's racial and class divide and its rampant crime. It gave rise to the term 'wilding' for urban mayhem by teenagers. 'Drugs. Guns. Gangs. New York City was just crime central at that time,' said former New York Detective Kirk Burkhalter, recalling an era so blood-soaked that the city had a record 2,245 homicides in 1990, compared with 414 in 2012. 'You were scared to ride the trains after dark. It was such a different place.' Trisha Meili was out jogging in Central Park on April 19, 1989, when she was bound, gagged, raped and beaten nearly to death, a chilling crime to which five teenage boys confessed after hours of interrogation by New York City police. From the start, the rape of a 28-year-old white woman in the park drew intense media coverage and led to the term 'wilding' to describe gangs of youths terrorizing random passersby. The five were convicted in 1990 based on the confessions, delivered after interrogations that in some cases lasted overnight. Twelve years later, Matias Reyes, a murderer and serial rapist who had attacked a woman in the park two days before Meili's assault, confessed to the crime, and DNA testing tied him to the rape. In a 2002 report recommending the convictions be vacated, prosecutor Nancy Ryan concluded that the boys' confessions contained 'troubling discrepancies' and that Reyes' description of the attack matched the crime scene. A judge vacated the convictions. By then, however, the boys had already been released after serving sentences ranging from five years to 13 years. In 2002, NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly appointed a panel to produce its own report, which concluded that the boys likely attacked Meili before Reyes did. Former prosecutor Michael Armstrong, who co-authored the report, said Ryan erred in dismissing the boys' confessions entirely. 'It seems impossible to say that they weren't there at all, because they knew too much,' he said in an interview. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the belief that the boys are guilty is pervasive among the dozens of police officers who have been deposed. 'They protect each other,' said Jane Fisher-Byrialsen, a lawyer for the five. 'It's always like this.' However, in prison, three of the men, Richardson, Salaam and Santan said they were innocent but acknowledged they were in the park committing assualts - but not rape. Mr. Santana indicated in his hearing that the larger group was out to rob people. 'I took part in with the beatings of that man,' he said. 'If I could go back in time and not do it again, you know, it would have been a whole different story.' The men’s lawyers have long said that their clients committed no crimes in the park that night. When Meili was found in the brush, more than 75 percent of her blood had drained from her body and her skull was smashed. She was in a coma for 12 days, left with permanent damage, and remembers nothing about the attack. Meili later went public as a motivational speaker and wrote a book. Raymond Santana and Kevin Richardson, both 14 at the time, Antron McCray and Salaam, 15, and Korey Wise, 16, were rounded up and arrested. After hours of interrogation, four of them recorded confessions on video, in some cases with the boys' parents in the room. Bravery: Trisha Meili, The Central Park Jogger published a book about her harrowing experience - waiving her anonymity to reveal her recovery and the trauma she experienced . At the trials, their lawyers argued the confessions were coerced. At the time, DNA testing was not sophisticated enough to make or break the case. In 2002, a re-examination of the case found that DNA on the victim's sock pointed to Matias Reyes, a murderer and serial rapist who confessed that he alone attacked the jogger. Then-District Attorney Robert Morgenthau stopped short of declaring the Central Park Five innocent but withdrew all charges and did not seek a retrial. (The statute of limitations for charging Reyes had run out; he is serving a life sentence for other crimes.) Roger Wareham, one of the lawyers for the five, said the DNA was the key. 'There was never any forensic evidence that tied them to this case,' he said. 'In 1989, everybody might not have been forensic savvy, but now, after 'Law and Order,' everybody knows if there's no DNA, they didn't do it.' But an overturned conviction does not automatically mean there was any wrongdoing by prosecutors or police. Legal experts said the case took a long time in part because of the money and reputations at stake. The two-hour documentary, 'The Central Park Five,' made the case that the men were wrongly convicted. The film uses extensive interviews with the men and their families, and lawyers for the city went to court to demand outtakes for use in the civil case. The defendants' lives since they got out of prison have not been easy. Wise was recently re-arrested. McCray moved away. Santana sold drugs and was sent back to prison, but now, along with Richardson and Salaam, has become the public face of the case, speaking out against wrongful convictions and racial profiling. 'We are over being angry. Now it's about helping others, raising our own families right,' said Santana, now 39 last year.","Central Park 5 - Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and Kharey Wise - settled for $40 million on Friday, 25-years after being convicted of a crime they didn't commit .

"Under fire: David Spondike, a high school music teacher from Akron, Ohio, has been suspended with pay after school officials say he posted a series of racially charged messages on his Facebook page . An Ohio high school music teacher has been placed on leave after posting racially charged rants on his Facebook page decrying the lewd actions of a 'ghetto' trick-or-treater. David Spondike, 51, was suspended with pay Monday from Firestone High School in Akron pending an internal investigation into allegations of inappropriate behavior. The local school district became aware of Spondike's online comments after an anonymous whistleblower emailed his expletive-filled Facebook tirades to several local media outlets. According to Akron School Superintendent David James, his remarks were directed at a teenager who exposed himself in front of young children and urinated on a telephone pole while trick-or-treating in Spondike's neighborhood in Copley Township Sunday, Ohio.com reported. Spondike's Facebook account has since been deleted. The original post read: ‘I don’t mind if you come from the ghetto to trick or treat. But when you whip out your teeny d**** and p*** on the telephone pole in front of my front yard and a bunch of preschoolers and toddlers, you can take your n*****-ass back where it came from. I don’t have anything against anyone of color, but n*****s, stay out.' Scroll down for video . Foul-mouthed tirade: Spondike posted this rant filled with racial slurs and expletives after a run-in with a trick-or-treater who allegedly exposed himself in his neighborhood and urinated on a telephone pole . The 51-year-old followed up with another message, writing that he 'welcomes people who come from dangerous neighborhoods to mine, so their children can safely trick or treat. I feel sorry that they feel they need to do so, but they have been coming here for years.' However, the music teacher warned outsiders that unruly behavior will not be tolerated. 'Your [sic] are a CRIMINAL and are not welcome in my neighborhood and you should not be welcome in your own! THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE COME TO MINE TO TRICK OR TREAT. Do not treat my neighborhood like you do your own. I HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO BE LIKE YOU.' Spondike then went on a tangent about the prevalent use of the N-word by 'black people' in his school. 'Racism is racism and to allow one race to use [a] word and not another IS racist. What I said was absolutely NOT racist by any stretch of the imagination.' Lashing out: Spondike, 51, posted the message on Facebook Sunday after allegedly spotting the black teenager outside his home in Copley Township . New calling: Spondike, a single father, was hired to teach music and orchestra to kids in 1998 after leaving a career in television . Mr Spondike further elaborated on the subject, telling his critics: 'If you want to be a language policeman, I suggest you find yourself in a George Orwell novel. When I try to get the teenagers in my school to stop using the word [racial slur], I only get laughed at.' After Spondike's controversial Facebook posts came to light, James said the teacher offered an apology 'to those who are sincerely offended.' ‘His comments were unprofessional and unbecoming a teacher,’ the superintendent said in a written statement. ‘Regardless of whether he was on his own time and own account doing this, he is a teacher; and his actions influence children. This is serious.’ Spondike, who describes himself on his Twitter account as 'Father. Educator. Musician. Sailor,' has been at the Akron School District since 1998, teaching music, music history and orchestra. In the early 90s, Spondike worked in television in Cincinnati, and at one point was an assistant director on The Jerry Springer Show. Over the past 13 years, Spondike has been investigated four times, beginning in 2000 when he threw a chair and used an obscenity in a classroom. Troubled past: Spondike's personnel records indicate that the Firestone High School teacher has been investigated four times since 2000, including for an incident where he threw a chair in class, and another instance where he spat on the floor in anger . A year later, the music teacher was again accused of misconduct after he spat on the floor during class because he was angry that a student dozed off. Around the same time, he landed in hot water for admonishing a fellow teacher for his failure to reprimand a student dressed in 'very baggy pants,' the station WKYC reported. In 2007, Spondike faced allegations of pinning a student from Goodyear Middle School against the wall, but he was ultimately cleared in connection to the incident. The school district will hold a hearing within the next week to determine what, if any punishment, Spondike will face.","Firestone High School music teacher David Spondike, 51, claimed his comment was directed at a teen who urinated on a pole near his house .

The new products will include a concealer, cleanser, mud mask and bronzer, as well as two new fragrances. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, John Demsey, group president of the Estée Lauder Cosmetics said the new range is 'aimed at enabling men to present their best self.' 'The man who’s shopping this category, in this distribution, feels very comfortable having this discussion,' he added. 'This is a serious, high-ticket men’s grooming line, with a couple of products with cosmetics benefits to be used in a very masculine way.' And the male rush to the make-up counter has been noticed in British department stores too, including Debenhams who reported a 24 per cent rise in sales of male grooming products according to the Telegraph. A spokesman added: 'Many are looking to achieve a groomed look rather than look too rugged.'","The designer has launched a new men's beauty range with Sephora .

"A photo of a breast cancer survivor's tattooed chest has been shared by hundreds of thousands of Facebook users after the social networking giant repeatably tried to remove it. The image showing the torso of a double mastectomy patient inked with colorful and intricate designs was posted by Lee Roller of the Ontario-based company Custom Tattoo Design. He said that after he shared the picture, which was taken from the book Bodies of Subversion: A Secret History of Women and Tattoo, it was promptly removed because it violated Facebook's  rules on nudity. Widespread support: This photo of a breast cancer survivor's tattooed chest has been shared by hundreds of thousands of Facebook users after the social networking giant repeatably tried to remove it . Mr Roller decided to re-post the photo in protest, asking other users to show awareness and support by Liking and sharing it. As of today the image has attracted 145,385 Likes, 119,150 shares and 17,683 comments. Most people are in favor of the picture and express anger at Facebook. One commentator wrote: 'If there's porn on Facebook how can this be removed?' Another added: 'I don't particularly . like tattoos, but I must say that this is far from offensive. Whoever . said so is blind, sexist, ignorant, and very closed minded to say the . least.' Anger: After the image was banned Mr Roller re-posted it in protest, asking others to show awareness and support by Liking and sharing it . Mr Roller said that he has also been contacted by dozens of women who want to have the same designs inked on their bodies. 'It's exciting for us as a company to . back something this strong,' he told the Huffington Post UK. Facebook has since stated that the image . will not be removed again, however some independent users have asked Mr . Roller to take it down. 'I don't particularly like tattoos, but I . must say that this is far from offensive... Whoever said so is blind' 'I have firmly let them know we will not remove the photo and in most cases I have removed these individuals from our site,' he explained. Facebook's guidelines on nudity and pornography currently read: ""Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. 'We also impose limitations on the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.' The woman in the photograph Mr Roller shared is Inga Duncan Thornell and the designs were completed by Seattle-based artist Tina Baforo. Ms Thornell reveals on her blog that it took one Sunday a month over two-and-a-half years to complete the design.","Inga Duncan Thornell had the designs inked on her chest following a double mastectomy .

"Muslim snooker player Rory McLeod has explained the reasoning behind the 'ISIS' badge he was spotted wearing against Ronnie O'Sullivan in the Welsh Open. McLeod, the only British Muslim on the snooker circuit, caused a stir on social media with his waistcoast badge bearing the initials 'ISIS' in his match against O'Sullivan on Monday. But he has since explained that the badge bore the logo of ISIS Business Solutions - his personal sponsors of the last 14 years - rather than of an Islamic terror organisation. Rory McLeod takes a shot against O'Sullivan with the ISIS badge clear on his chest . McLeod's link with the company is long-standing - here he wears the badge at the  UK Championship .

"Drunk: Sherri Wilkins had a blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit when she struck Philip Moreno and drove 2.3 miles with his body stuck in her windshield . A substance-abuse counselor who drove 2 miles through a Los Angeles suburb with a dying man on her windshield was convicted Tuesday of second-degree murder, drunken driving and hit-and-run charges. Sherry Lynn Wilkins showed no response as the Superior Court jury returned with its verdict. Wilkins' blood-alcohol level was nearly twice the legal limit for driving when she struck 31-year-old Phillip Moreno in November 2012 in suburban Torrance, prosecutors said. Wilkins, 52, who was an addict before she became a drug and alcohol counselor, said she had been drinking that night but wasn't drunk. She said she had been 'self-medicating' while waiting for knee-replacement surgery and had consumed three airplane-size bottles of vodka and a can of Budweiser beer and Clamato before starting to drive. Deputy District Attorney John Harlan told jurors that after Wilkins hit Moreno, she 'drove him closer to his death.' Harlan said the force of the crash punched a hole in the passenger side of Wilkins' window and Moreno lost his shoes and pants, but still she didn't stop to render aid or call 911. On trial: Wilkins is charged with one count each of murder, DUI causing injury, driving with a 0.08 percent or higher blood-alcohol content causing injury and leaving the scene of an accident . Full force: Police said Moreno was still able to speak to them when he was pulled from the car windshield in 2012 . Freed: Police said Moreno was still able to speak to them when he was pulled from the car windshield . It wasn't until passing motorists . noticed the bizarre scene that they were able to swarm Wilkins' car at a . traffic light and keep her there until police arrived. She . testified during the trial, telling jurors the story of her addiction, . which began when she was in a car accident at the age of 15 and suffered . a broken back and shattered bones in her ankles and legs. Wilkins said . she started using heroin when it became 'cheaper than going to the . doctor.' Wilkins, who . acknowledged having served time for residential burglaries over the . years, said she kicked the heroin habit with the help of methadone and . more recently had been using medical marijuana. She told of obtaining a . degree in addiction counselling and going to work at a treatment center. Wilkins was leaving the center on the night of the crash. She . told the court Mr Moreno seemed to fly onto her car in the 2012 . incident in Torrance, but the events remained a surreal blur. Prosecutors say Mr Moreno was struck so hard that he flipped onto Wilkins' car and punched a hole in the windshield. ‘It was a flash, ‘Wilkins said. ‘I pretty much felt him landing on my window. To me, it felt like he came from the sky.’ Asked . by her attorney, Nan Whitfield, how she felt in that moment, she said, ‘Very confused, . like it wasn't real. It took me a while to figure out there was a body . on the windshield.’ ‘I didn't feel like I had hit him with my car,’ she said. ‘I felt like he fell into my windshield from up high.’ Wilkins . said she panicked and kept driving until other motorists told her to . pull over. ‘I was very scared,’ she said. ‘I kind of froze.’ Victim: Moreno was pronounced dead at the hospital . ‘Were you happy in November of 2012?’ asked Whitfield. ‘For the first time I was,’ she whispered and began to cry. Superior . Court Judge Henry Hall cut off further exploration of her personal . history. Wilkins is being brought to the courtroom in a wheel chair. On cross-examination, Deputy District . Attorney John Harlan asked if Wilkins thought that night she should call . her husband to pick her up since she had been drinking. ‘No,’ she said. ‘I wasn't drunk.’ Asked what she was thinking, Wilkins said, ‘I was thinking I'd better hurry up and get home before the effects hit me.’ Asked . about her lack of response afterward, she said, ‘I was freaking out. It . was not like I knew what was happening ... I still can't believe what . happened.’ Wilkins faces a maximum sentence of 45 years to life.

She was allegedly driving under the influence, has been accused of striking a pedestrian and then driving for more than two miles with the dying victim lodged in the windshield and on the hood of her car .","Sherri Wilkins, 51, was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving in 2012 .

"For more than a year and a half, Joe Nagy's nose just wouldn't stop running. At first he put it down to year-round allergies caused by the Arizona weather. The condition occurred once or twice a week, especially when he sat up in bed, but within a short time his nose ran constantly. Scroll down for video... Drip: Joe Nagy's nose would not stop running for more than eighteen months. He went to the doctor to be told fluid from his brain was leaking out . Eventually, Mr Nagy's condition became unbearable,' I got to the point where I had tissues all the time' he told Fox 10. He finally went to the doctor to be told his runny nose was far from run-of-mill allergies: his brain was leaking. The problem would occur on a daily basis. 'This clear liquid dribbled out of my nose like tears out of your eyes. I go what is this?' 'I got to the point where I had tissues all the time. My pockets were full of folded-up tissues.' Joe Nagy: He had to stuff his pockets full of tissues to soak up the non-stop dripping from his nose . Leak: Mr Nagy believed the Arizona climate was to blame for his 'allergies' but a doctor told him a hole in his brains' membrane was causing fluid to drip out . It also caused Joe some embarrassing moments in public. On several occasions he failed to reach his tissues in time and fluid would spill out. Around a teaspoonful splashed over some instructions for his model airplanes that he was building. After realising the allergy medication was having absolutely no effect whatsoever he went sought out medical advice. A doctor diagnosed the problem fairly soon afterwards. The membrane surrounding Joe's brain had a hole in it and his brain fluid was leaking out. 'You don't really think about it, but our brains are really just above our noses all of the time,' said Barrow Neurological Institute neurosurgeon Peter Nakaji to KSAZ. 'This is one of the more common conditions to be missed for a long time... because so many people have runny noses.' Joe was about to have an operation to patch the hole when he contracted a case of near-deadly meningitis and the brain fluid became infected. Advice: Doctors suggest anyone experiencing similar symptoms should visit an allergist or an ear, nose and throat specialist . Dr. Nakaji explains that human bodies produce around 12 ounces of brain fluid each day which is enough to keep the brain from drying out and another reason why Joe's runny nose never stopped. Doctors advise that if you have a runny nose, to first consult an allergist or an ear, nose and throat specialist. Brain fluid is different to a runny nose caused by allergies because the liquid is exceptionally clear. There can be various causes that would set off a leak. Sometimes a past head injury can lead to brain fluid leaking, or it can be caused from complications from a spinal tap or surgery . 'These leaks can be very very tiny, a little like a puncture on a bicycle tire, that sometimes you have trouble even finding where it is.' Mr Nagy underwent surgery. It didn't require any cutting into the brain itself. Instead the procedure is carried out through the nose and essentially glue was used to seal up the hole. 'This is just a bit of cartilage from the nose that we can get to repair over it and then the body will seal it up,' said Doctor Nakaji. This week, the gauze was removed by doctors from his nose. Joe began to wait for the dripping to begin. 'I was waiting for the dribble. This leaking cause I was so used to it every day. I got my hankie. Nothing. It's never come back.'","Joe Nagy's nose ran constantly and he thought it was allergies .

"The owners of the Superman brand have  banned a tortured boy's memorial from featuring their logo because they 'don't want to be associated with child abuse', it emerged today. Five-year-old Superman fan Jeffrey Baldwin, from Toronto, Canada, died in tragic circumstances 12 years ago when he was starved to death by his grandparents. He had been locked in a cold, urine and faeces-stained bedroom in the home of his grandmother, his Catholic Children's Aid Society-approved guardian, and wasted away to the weight of a baby. Tragic five-year-old Jeffrey Baldwin, from Toronto, died of starvation. He is pictured here in his Superman costume for Halloween . Following an inquest earlier this year, Ottawa IT worker Todd Boyce was touched by the words of Jeffrey's father Richard in his testimony, and started raising money for a statue of Jeffrey. Mr Baldwin had said: 'He wanted to fly. He tried jumping off the chair. We had to make him stop. He dressed up (as Superman) for Halloween one year. He was so excited. I have that picture at home hanging on my wall. He was our little man of steel.' Mr Baldwin added that before his teenage parents lost custody of Jeffrey to his maternal grandparents the little boy was very energetic and loved the superhero. Mr Boyce's appeal to raise money online was successful, and the statue was designed and the model created, with Jeffrey wearing his favourite costume. But, Mr Boyce says, when DC Entertainment found out, the comic book giant refused him permission to use the iconic diamond-shaped 'S' logo. 'It was important for me because I really felt I wanted to capture the photograph of Jeffrey wearing his Superman costume and have it as close to that as possible,' Mr Boyce told CBC News. 'Basically they didn't want to have the character of Superman associated with child abuse. They weren't comfortable with that.' DC Entertainment is refusing to allow the Superman logo to adorn the memorial statue of Jeffrey, who loved the superhero during his short life before his grandparents starved him to death . Mr Boyce told  CBC News he was angry and emotional when he first learned of their refusal, but after subsequent conversations with people at the company and their lawyers, he softened his stance. '(I) realized that the most important thing is to have a fitting monument for Jeffrey, that it's about him,' Boyce said. 'To be fair to DC I don't think they wanted to say no. I think they gave it serious thought.' Mr Boyce said the design will be changed to have a 'J' on the chest rather than the 'S' of the Superman logo. The model of the statue is complete - except for the letter change - and is just now waiting  to be cast in bronze. Mr Boyce is hoping to unveil it in September. One of Jeffrey's sisters has chosen a poem to be engraved on a bench that will be part of the memorial, Mr Boyce said. It begins with the line 'I wish heaven had a phone so I could hear your voice again.' Jeffrey's grandparents were convicted of second-degree murder in 2006 had custody of Jeffrey and his three siblings. Two of them were treated relatively well, the inquest heard, but one of his sisters was subjected to the same conditions. The difference between Jeffrey and his sister was that she was allowed to go to school and the daily snack she received there probably saved her life, the inquest heard. MailOnline has approached DC Entertainment for a comment.","Bronze statue created after campaigners raised cash to have it made .

"Hazmat crews and disease control officials swooped on a plane this afternoon amid Ebola fears prompted by a Liberian man who started vomiting on a flight to Newark Liberty airport, just outside of New York City. Passengers were held for hours as the man - thought to be 35 - and his young daughter were rushed off the plane to hospital. Doctors later confirmed that neither of them has the deadly virus. Hospital authorities said the man, believed to be around 35, instead has an unrelated disease which is easily treatable. His daughter, believed to be 10, was also taken to hospital amid fears she was carrying the fatal virus. But she showed no symptoms of any illness at all, doctors said. Panic stations: Officers hand out facemasks to protect from Ebola after a man was thought to have landed at Newark Liberty Airport with the deadly virus . On board: Welsh passenger Paul Chard tweeted this picture of immigration officials getting on the plane . A statement from University Hospital in Newark, where the two were take, said neither person has symptoms consistent with deadly Ebola, which is sweeping West Africa and has the U.S. on high alert. Both will be released soon - though they will be monitored by health experts in case any symptoms do appear. It said: 'University Hospital in Newark, in coordination with federal, state and local public health officials, evaluated two individuals who arrived at Newark Liberty International Airport this afternoon. 'After an examination by physicians at University Hospital, the symptoms of one individual were found to be consistent with another, minor treatable condition unrelated to Ebola. 'The second individual, who was traveling with the patient, was asymptomatic. The two individuals will be released with continued monitoring.' Hazmat crews from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) earlier rushed to the plane, which arrived from Brussels, Belgium, at around 1.50pm and was left waiting on the tarmac. CDC officials met a United Airlines flight at Newark Airport carrying a man possibly showing Ebola symptoms - but he was later cleared . Texas patient: Thomas Duncan became the first person to be diagnosed with the disease in the United States . The  man, said to be 35 years old, traveling with his daughter, reported to be around 10, on a United Airlines flight from Brussels was  vomiting as they landed in New Jersey at 1.50pm today. They were both removed from the plane by a CDC crew wearing full Hazmat attire and taken to University Hospital in Newark. It comes as the Ebola patient in Texas is said to have deteriorated to a 'critical' condition. The remaining passengers have now been allowed to leave after being forced to stay on the plane then wait in immigration. One man - who got through customs and almost out of the airport before officials changed their minds and told him to stay - spoke of the confused response from the airport and health officials which left him and his fellow passengers in the dark. Despite reports claiming the passenger was found to be noncontagious after initial examinations, the New York and New Jersey Port Authority told MailOnline the passenger was not cleared at the airport and has since been taken to hospital. He has since been seen arriving at University Hospital in a wheelchair wearing protective overalls, gloves and a surgical mask. The man is believed to have flown from Liberia via Brussels, Belgium - the same route taken by Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. Duncan's condition has today been classed as 'critical' as he is treated for the disease in Dallas, Texas. Ten people linked to him have been classed as 'high risk'. Today's possible case brought chaos and confusion to the airport - to the bewilderment of waiting passengers, who were not told about that the emergency was linked to Ebola for more than an hour. Rich Burchett, a passenger on the flight who was sitting close to the potential Ebola victim, told how the man's face was covered with a mask and he was rushed to the back of the plane when flight attendants found he came from Liberia. He said: 'Once they found out he was from Liberia they put a mask on him and his daughter, then they got him out of his seat and took him to somewhere at the back of the plane.' Mr Burchett, who said he was 'very nervous' for his own health when he heard there was a risk of Ebola risk, told CNN that he was moved away from the area into another part of the plane after the man had been taken away. He added that he did not see the man vomit while on board the plane - though officials were clear that this did occur at some point. Mr Burchett characterized the airport response as chaotic, adding that it raised questions about how a more contagious disease could be handled. He said the situation was 'very uncoordinated inside the airport. Lots of people were giving directions - sometimes they were conflicting'. An official statement from airport authorities referred only to an 'ill customer'. Quarantined: Ten people have been assessed as 'high risk' and evacuated for Hazmat to sanitize the area . It said: 'Upon arrival at Newark Airport from Brussels, medical professionals instructed that customers and crew of United flight 988 remain on board until they could assist an ill customer.' 'We are working with authorities and will accommodate our customers as quickly as we can.' Welsh passenger Paul Chard tweeted a picture of immigration officials on board the plane, adding: 'Drama on the flight from BRU, pax taken off by CDC, we are stuck on the plane, Immigration staff now on!' The 261 passengers were then handed leaflets titled, 'Possible Exposure: Ebola. What you need to do'. It read: 'You are being given this card because a sick person who might have been exposed to Ebola sat near you on a plane OR had contact with you in an airport. 'Spread of Ebola on a plane or in an airport is NOT likely. However, CDC is being extra careful to ensure you safety. 'In the next few days, a public health official will let you know if the sick person has Ebola or not. 'If the person has Ebola, you will be evaluated and given additional instructions. 'If the person does NOT have Ebola, no further action is needed.' It goes on to explain that 'Ebola is a severe, often fatal disease that spreads through direct contact with an infected person'. At the bottom of the leaflet there is a note for passengers to hand to their doctors, explaining the situation and advising that they be examined. The incident comes just a day after the government conceded that its handling of the crisis has so far been 'rocky' as Thomas Duncan is treated for the disease in Texas and 10 people are now classed as 'high risk'. The handling of the Dallas case in the early stages of Duncan's illness has raised questions about how prepared local and national health officials were to handle that case and whether people were unnecessarily exposed. Dr Anthony Fauci, a director at the National Institutes of Health, insisted to reporters at the White House that although it 'may be entirely conceivable' that there would be another Ebola case in the United States, the strength of the healthcare infrastructure 'would make it extraordinarily unlikely that we would have an outbreak.' Authorities have narrowed their focus to about 50 people who had direct or indirect contact with the infected Liberian visitor, including 10 at high risk who are being checked twice daily for symptoms. Dr Fauci said contact tracing is 'now' going on, five days after Duncan was hospitalized. Officials were asked at a news conference why the patient was able to get past screening in his journey from Liberia on September 19 and then be sent home after telling a Dallas hospital a few days later about his travel to a country where there had been an Ebola outbreak. The case has put authorities and the public on alert over concerns that the worst epidemic of Ebola on record could spread from West Africa, where it began in March. The World Health Organization on Friday updated its death toll to at least 3,439 out of 7,492 suspected, probable and confirmed cases. The epidemic has hit hardest in impoverished Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. At Friday's news conference, White House adviser Lisa Monaco was asked whether she would recommend to President Barack Obama that he impose a travel ban on West Africa, as some public officials have called for. 'Right now we believe those types of steps actually impede the response,' Monaco said.","Fears virus could spread further - but ill man on plane does NOT have Ebola .

"A 17-year-old boy sent to live with his great-grandmother is accused of killing her Friday with help from his cousin. Joda Cain was sent to live with Jacqueline Bell in an effort to escape problems he’d been having at home, instead he killed her with help from his cousin Micus Ward, 19, and stole her Lexus, officials charged. The two murder suspects took cops on a high speed chase at speeds as high as 135MPH before they were apprehended. Cops pulling them over were initially unaware of the murder, only finding out after calling in the stolen car. 'He's not that person': Joda Cain's mother insists her son (pictured with the gun) with cousin Marcus Ward (back) wouldn't kill anyone . Ms Bell died of blunt force trauma, officials said. They have not yet specified a murder weapon. Mr Cain’s mother sent him this summer to live with Bell because he was having problems back home in Kansas City, she told KSHB. ‘He needed to get away he was having issues, he was getting in trouble,’ the mother, who asked not to be identified, explained. The young boy was thriving out west, even taking part in sports. ‘He was happy, he was happy,’ the devastated mother said between tears. ‘Everything was going good and he was back to playing football and everything was great for all I knew.’ Loving great grandmother: Jacqueline Bell agreed to take Mr Cain in to help him get over troubles he was having back home . Ms Bell spoiled the troubled teen, his mother told the station. Her generosity knew no limits, she even bought Mr Ward a plane ticket to come visit. However, a series of pictures posted to Micus Ward’s Facebook page the night he arrived showed a completely different Jona Cain than the one described by his mother. Clouds of smoke, alcohol, and a chilling picture of him pointing a gun with a wad of money in his mouth appear on the social media site. 'He's spoiled rotten': Mr Cain's mother said Ms Bell spoiled her son rotten, that the two loved each other very much . Formerly imprisoned: Marcus Ward bragged on his Facebook page about a prior incarceration . Cops found his dead great-grandmother the next morning. The two young men were caught a short time later in the dead woman’s car, pulled over after the high-speed chase for dangerous driving. Police discovered the woman was dead after reporting the car stolen. The two teens were immediately arrested. Despite officials saying Mr Cain was involved in Ms Bell’s death, and being pulled over in her stolen car, his mother insists he didn’t do it. ‘He's not that person,’ she told KSHB. ‘He's really not. He's not perfect, he's spoiled rotten but my God he would never, never do that to her, he'd never do that to anybody.’ Change of scenery: Joda Cain was thriving away from home, staying out of trouble and playing football . Mr Cain has been charged with unauthorized use of a vehicle, attempt to elude, reckless driving and reckless endangering – if he is charged with murder it will be as an adult. Mr Ward has been charged with criminal homicide and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, his bail has been set at $10,000.","Jona Cain had been sent this summer to live with Jacqueline Bell to escape problems back hom in Kansas City, Missouri .

"Two teenagers have been arrested after a video emerged showing them chasing, punching and body-slamming a mentally challenged man as he screamed for mercy. The boys, aged 13 and 14, were arrested by police in New Castle County, Delaware on Saturday, and authorities have said more arrests could be made, Fox29 reported. The 86-second footage, which was posted to YouTube, shows a group of teenagers chasing the 26-year-old victim outside an apartment complex in Brookside Park as he shouts: 'Leave me alone!' One boy swings at the man, repeatedly punching him, before picking him up and throwing him to the ground on at least two occasions. Scroll down for video . Attack: The victim (in gray) can be seen trying to stop the youths from attacking him in the shocking footage . Violent: One of the boys picks the man up before throwing him to the ground. Others can be heard laughing . Hurt: The man, who can be heard groaning, had to be treated at hospital afterwards for injuries . The boys then crowd around the man - while one teenager who is filming the attack on his cellphone nears the man to get a closer shot as he writhes on the floor. Later footage also reveals them continuing their attack in a wooded area, Fox29 reported. Again, they body slam him and throw him into some water as they can be heard laughing. The victim can be heard crying, while a female voice says: 'You guys are so mean to him.' In another attack, as one of the group mocks the man, he can be heard saying: 'What did I do?' The man was taken to hospital and treated for injuries from the attack and later released. Cruel: As the group surround him, one of the teenagers (with the backpack) is more concerned about getting a close-up snap of the victim than helping him. Two teenagers have now been arrested . The man's family said they are sickened by the footage. They said he suffers from Williams syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disorder. The disorder leaves sufferers with an intellectual disability, heart defects, slight stature and distinctive facial features, including a flat nasal bridge. Sufferers are often extremely friendly. 'He's not doing too good,' his godmother Debra Jackson told CBS3. 'He's ashamed about it happening, he’s embarrassed.' She added that the man had thought the teenagers were his friends. Authorities said they believe the video, which was posted to YouTube before going viral on social media sites including Instagram and Twitter, appears to be several weeks old. They are continuing to investigate the incident and expect more arrests to be made. Concern: The victim's godmother and sister said that he is ashamed and thought the teens were his friends . The teenagers who were arrested have been charged with offensive touching, assault on a vulnerable adult and third-degree conspiracy, the Delaware News Journal reported. Both have been released on a $2,500 each and have been ordered to have no contact with the victim. One of the teens who was in the video told CBS3 Eyewitness News that he helped file a report. 'The right thing to do was call the cops,' he said, without revealing his identity. 'If you beat up a mentally disabled person, you should be locked away for good.' See video below .","Boys, 13 and 14, were arrested on Saturday 'for attacking Delaware man in footage that was then posted to YouTube'

"Police are concerned the easy access to violent online pornography is directly linked to the types of sexual assaults being committed by young men. 'I believe the impact of porn and young men's access to it and the rise in sexual violence are related', NSW Assistant Commissioner Mark Mudoch told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Murdoch also said consumption of these aggressive forms of pornography, which in no way reflect real life, is having an adverse impact and 'influence on respectful relationships'. White Ribbon, a group which works stop violence towards women, told Daily Mail Australia research suggested more young males were searching for violent pornography. There are concerns that young men watching violent forms of pornography are resulting in more aggressive sexual assaults . 'What we understand from research of pornographic sites and porn is that there is an increasing demand for more violent types of pornography', CEO Libby Davies said. She also revealed that research, conducted over the past four years, shows a concerning increase in the 'expectation of young men is that sexual relationships are based on a level of violence.' Mr Murdoch relayed a recent incident where a sexually active teenage couple aged just 16 were completely unaware of the concept on consent. The  boy would apparently have sex with his girlfriend without her consent, but neither party believed this to be a crime. NSW Assistant Commissioner Mark Murdoch warned that behaviours seen in violent porn which may be copied by young men needed to be targeted early with education so young men don't end up being perpetrators of violent sexual crimes . 'I nearly had an argument with the researcher', Mr Murdoch revealed. 'I couldn't believe it.' White Ribbon CEO Libby Davies said more young men are searching for violent porn . 'This is what some people believe is a normal relationship.' Mr Murdoch added that he 'certainly' supports the idea that greater education about pornography is needed to prevent this concerning trend, but pointed out the responsibility does not rely solely on schools to do this. 'There's a big role for the parents in all of this. 'As a community it's a problem that needs to be addressed', Mr Murdoch said. Ms Davies said they are currently trying to educate young people about the perils of social media and some of the things they may be exposed to while online. 'What is sometimes portrayed as normal behaviour is actually abhorrent behaviour', she said. Mr Murdoch agreed that action needed to be taken so that violent behaviours do not develop into more serious ones. 'If it's let go these young men can end up being perpetrators of violent sexual crimes', he warned. Ms Davies also said the danger can lie where what is sometimes portrayed as normal behaviour is actually abhorrent behaviour .","Concerns are growing about young men choosing to access to violent pornography .

"A Wisconsin grandmother has been memorialized by her relative using all of her quirks, painting a picture of the woman for those who never met 'Pink'. Mary 'Pink' Mullaney was 85-years-old when she passed away in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin on September 1, but the obituatary created by her six children and 17 grandchildren makes her seem full of life. 'If you're about to throw away an old pair of pantyhose, stop,' it reads in the opening line. 'We were blessed to learn many valuable lessons from Pink during her 85 years, among them: Never throw away old pantyhose. Use the old ones to tie gutters, child-proof cabinets, tie toilet flappers, or hang Christmas ornaments.' Woman with quirks: Mary 'Pink' Mullaney's relatives worked together to write an adorable obituary . The lengthy obituary is made up by a . long list of anecdotal truisms that the grandmother espoused, showing . her love of both underprivileged humans and scorned animals. 'If . a possum takes up residence in your shed, grab a barbecue brush to coax . him out. If he doesn't leave, brush him for twenty minutes and let him . stay,' the obituary suggests. Her . Catholic faith appears to be a constant theme throughout the collection . of stories, and her funeral was held at her local church on Friday. 'Let . a dog (or two or three) share your bed. Say the rosary while you walk . them. Go to church with a chicken sandwich in your purse. Cry at the . consecration, every time. Give the chicken sandwich to your homeless . friend after mass,' the obituary read. 'When you learn someone's name, share their patron saint's story, and their feast day, so they can celebrate.' Frequent visitor: 'Pink' was a devout Catholic and her funeral was held at St. Monica's Catholic Church in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin. She would regularly attend mass with a chicken sandwich in her purse for a homeless friend . Her three surviving siblings live in New 'Joisey' but Mrs Mullaney's children were the ones to write the obituary. 'We wanted it to portray who she was and her love for people and just her funny ways of going about it. She was an extraordinary person in an ordinary way,' her son Kevin Mullaney told ABCNews.com. One funny example of her child-rearing tactics shows her sense of humor: 'Put picky-eating children in the box at the bottom of the laundry chute, tell them they are hungry lions in a cage, and feed them veggies through the slats'. The write-up describes her as a warm-hearted person who welcomed 'new friends' to Thanksgiving dinner and was kept busy by a roster of pen pals. 'Take magazines you've already read to your doctors' office for others to enjoy. Do not tear off the mailing label, ""Because if someone wants to contact me, that would be nice,""' was another piece of advice. If you're about to throw away an old pair of pantyhose, stop. Consider: Mary Agnes Mullaney (you probably knew her as ""Pink"") who entered eternal life on Sunday, September 1, 2013. Her spirit is carried on by her six children, 17 grandchildren, three surviving siblings in New ""Joisey"", and an extended family of relations and friends from every walk of life. We were blessed to learn many valuable lessons from Pink during her 85 years, among them: Never throw away old pantyhose. Use the old ones to tie gutters, child-proof cabinets, tie toilet flappers, or hang Christmas ornaments. Also: If a possum takes up residence in your shed, grab a barbecue brush to coax him out. If he doesn't leave, brush him for twenty minutes and let him stay. Let a dog (or two or three) share your bed. Say the rosary while you walk them. Go to church with a chicken sandwich in your purse. Cry at the consecration, every time. Give the chicken sandwich to your homeless friend after mass. Go to a nursing home and kiss everyone. When you learn someone's name, share their patron saint's story, and their feast day, so they can celebrate. Invite new friends to Thanksgiving dinner. If they are from another country and you have trouble understanding them, learn to ""listen with an accent."" Never say mean things about anybody; they are ""poor souls to pray for."" Put picky-eating children in the box at the bottom of the laundry chute, tell them they are hungry lions in a cage, and feed them veggies through the slats. Correspond with the imprisoned and have lunch with the cognitively challenged. Do the Jumble every morning. Keep the car keys under the front seat so they don't get lost. Make the car dance by lightly tapping the brakes to the beat of songs on the radio. Offer rides to people carrying a big load or caught in the rain or summer heat. Believe the hitchhiker you pick up who says he is a landscaper and his name is ""Peat Moss."" Help anyone struggling to get their kids into a car or shopping cart or across a parking lot. Give to every charity that asks. Choose to believe the best about what they do with your money, no matter what your children say they discovered online. Allow the homeless to keep warm in your car while you are at Mass. Take magazines you've already read to your doctors' office for others to enjoy. Do not tear off the mailing label, ""Because if someone wants to contact me, that would be nice."" In her lifetime, Pink made contact time after time. Those who've taken her lessons to heart will continue to ensure that a cold drink will be left for the overheated garbage collector and mail carrier, every baby will be kissed, every nursing home resident will be visited, the hungry will have a sandwich, the guest will have a warm bed and soft nightlight, and the encroaching possum will know the soothing sensation of a barbecue brush upon its back. Above all, Pink wrote - to everyone, about everything. You may read this and recall a letter from her that touched your heart, tickled your funny bone, or maybe made you say ""huh?"" She is survived by her children and grandchildren whose photos she would share with prospective friends in the checkout line: Tim (wife Janice, children Timmy, Joey, T.J., Miki and Danny); Kevin (wife Kathy, children Kacey, Ryan, Jordan and Kevin); Jerry (wife Gita, children Nisha and Cathan); MaryAnne; Peter (wife Maria Jose, children Rodrigo and Paulo); and Meg (husband David Vartanian, children Peter, Lily, Jerry and Blase); siblings Anne, Helen, and Robert; and many in-laws, nieces, nephews, friends and family too numerous to list but not forgotten. Pink is reunited with her husband and favorite dance and political debate partner, Dr. Gerald L. Mullaney, and is predeceased by six siblings. Friends (and strangers she would love to have met) can visit with Pink's family at the Feerick Funeral Home on Thursday, September 5, from 3 until 7 PM with prayer service at 6:45 PM. Mass of the Christian Burial will be celebrated at St. Monica's Catholic Church in Whitefish Bay on Friday, September 6, at 3 PM. Dress comfortably with a splash of pink if you have it. In Pink's memory donations may be made to Dominican High School, 120 E. Silver Spring Dr., Whitefish Bay, WI 53217, or Saint Monica Parish, 160 E. Silver Spring Dr., Whitefish Bay, WI 53217, or any charity that seeks to spread the Good News of Pink's friend, Jesus.

"US Marine Gunnery Sergeant Brian Meyer was deployed as a bomb technician in Afghanistan in 2011 when the device he was defusing exploded prematurely. The then 29-year-old Marine was ripped apart by the blast. He lost his right leg above the knee, his right hand above the wrist and three fingers of his left hand. While still receiving treatment on the battlefield, Sgt Meyer, fearful of the impact his injuries would have on his squad, ordered Eric Lunson to take his photograph. Forcing a smile through the pain, Sgt Meyer, raised what would have earlier been a thumbs' up as the shutter clicked. The photograph, Sgt Meyer hoped, would provide inspiration for his men as he began his own battle with recovery. Scroll down for video . Marine Gunnery Sergeant Brian Meyer bravely smiled for the camera after he lost . his right leg above the knee, his right hand above the wrist and three . fingers on his left hand after a bomb he was defusing in 2011 exploded, left, Sgt Meyer has rebuilt his life, right, and now works counselling fellow veterans who suffered terrible injuries . Sgt Meyer, has retired from the Marines however, he continues to undergo pioneering medical treatment from Navy Commander Peter Shumaker, right at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego, California. The special laser, pictured, softens scar tissue on Sgt Meyer's arm allowing him greater movement and less pain . Sgt Meyer said he did not want special ramps fitted to his home or be confined to a wheelchair, instead he vowed to walk again and maintain an active lifestyle . Since the . War on Terror and the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, almost 2,000 US . troops have lost one or more limbs as a result of combat injuries. Now, . the Naval Health Research Center has embarked on a six-year study, to . help wounded warriors rebuild their lives. So . far, 1,500 personnel have signed up to the Wounded Warrior Recovery . Project, however, the Navy wants to increase that figure to 10,000. In . addition to the amputees, a further 50,000 people have suffered serious . combat injuries while deployed in either Iraq or Afghanistan. A . staggering 16,000 of them would not have survived in an earlier . conflict. Doctors say a positive attitude is key to . recovery, so the study will also examine mental resilience and why some . troops have it and others don't. It will rely on Web-based, telephone . and mailed surveys conducted every six months about mobility, ability to . function and social activity. The aim of the study is to review how veterans cope and enjoy life after suffering debilitating injuries such as Sgt Meyer. It is expected to last six years and will help understand how the injured personnel's quality of life impacts their long-term care. Troops such as Sgt Meyer are  pushing military medicine to find better ways to accommodate such a large population of young, severely disabled combat veterans who want to maintain an active lifestyle. Many wear out their prosthetic limbs in a matter of months doing everything from mountain climbing to running marathons. Among the projects Sgt Meyer is involved with is Warfighter Made, which customises sports cars, off-roaders  and motorbikes for wounded veterans. He said: 'What we want is for a guy in the coolest car to drive up to a handicap spot and have people like, ""What's this guy doing?"" Then they see him get out with his prosthetic legs.' Sgt Meyer has no regrets having ordered Eric Lunson to take the the battlefield photograph showing his horrendous injuries, instead looks at it with a certain amount of pride: 'It's the exact opposite of what somebody expects you to do. So when I show it to people they are inspired by it, instead of being shocked, I know they get it' Commander Peter Shumaker, chief of dermatology at the Naval Center in . San Diego pioneered some of the techniques being used on severely injured veterans, he said: 'It's a privilege to work with soldiers and Marines, . like Brian, because they're young and motivated and healthy and they can . go farther than we ever thought' Meyer is not yet part of the study but intends to participate. His case was featured in the New England Journal of Medicine in May to demonstrate the success of battlefield trauma care over the past decade. The retired Marine has benefited from a host of new medical strategies used by the military, including laser treatments. Cmdr. Peter Shumaker, chief of dermatology at Naval Medical Center San Diego, helped pioneer the use of an ablative laser - commonly used to smooth wrinkled or acne-scarred skin - to ease Meyer's scar tissue, dramatically improving the range of motion in his fingers, among other things. He said: 'It's a privilege to work with soldiers and Marines, like Brian, because they're young and motivated and healthy and they can go farther than we ever thought, . 'They don't want to just walk, they want to do things that their colleagues are doing, their friends are doing.' Meyer was hospitalised for a month after the 2011 bomb blast in Afghanistan. He lost his right leg above the knee, and his right hand above the wrist. Early during his rehabilitation, Sgt Meyer rejected offers of installing ramps at his home as he wanted to lead as full a life as possible claiming 'I focus on what I have left, not what I lost' Only his pinky and ring finger remained intact on his left hand. After multiple surgeries, he was outfitted for prosthetics and learned to walk again. But Meyer, 29 at the time, wanted full independence. He turned down offers to install wheelchair ramps in his home. He debated before accepting a handicap parking permit. He did not want to avoid the struggle to reintegrate. He wanted to go anywhere. He said: 'I focus on what I have left, not what I lost.'. His prosthetic arm has a flashlight so at night he can see where he plants his prosthetic foot. His prosthetic arm has the knobs and battery pack positioned to one side so he can shoot a bow and arrow. Thanks to the laser treatments on his scar tissue, he can now hold a toothbrush, write with a pen, dial his phone, and pull the trigger of a hunting rifle. Laser treatments also removed a sore, allowing him to withstand his prosthetic leg for 18 hours a day. Shumaker and Dr. Chad Hivnor, who recently retired from Lackland Air Force Base, helped pioneer the method. Hivnor also discovered botulinum toxin A injections decrease perspiration where the prosthetic limb attaches, helping stop it from slipping off while the person is exercising or in hot climates. The findings were recently presented to the American Academy of Dermatology to promote the treatment for severely scarred people in the general population. Shumaker said: 'These are not special, scar lasers or special, wounded warrior lasers. We've taken these techniques that are primarily used for cosmetic purposes and altered them a bit to apply to trauma rehabilitation.' Such unconventional treatments make a big difference in daily life, veterans and their doctors say. One soldier's scar tissue has softened so he can grasp his daughter's hand; another can now type. A week after a recent treatment, Meyer rode on his motorcycle through a shopping district in Murrieta, 60 miles northeast of San Diego. His pinky and ring finger operated the throttle that has been put on the left side because he only has a left wrist. It has a side car that can carry another amputee, wheelchair or his dog. Meyer and two others have started the nonprofit organisation, Warfighter Made, which modified his motorcycle. It also customises sports cars, off-road vehicles and other transportation for veterans, who can join in the work. 'What we want is for a guy in the coolest car to drive into a handicap spot and have people be like, ""What's this guy doing?"" Then they see him get out with his prosthetic legs,' said Meyer. His prosthetic leg features a sticker of Bill Murray and the word 'Laugh.' Meyer works for the Injured Marines Semper Fi Fund, counseling fellow combat veterans. He loves the photograph taken after he was injured. He said: 'It's the exact opposite of what somebody expects you to do. So when I show it to people and they are inspired by it, instead of being shocked, I know they get it.' Due to the revolutionary laser treatment which softened his scars, Sgt Meyer is able to operate the controls of his motorbike using the two fingers of his left hand .","US Marine Gunnery Sergeant Brian Meyer was seriously injured after a bomb he was defusing exploded in 2011 .

"A man known as 'Fat Boy' and 'Biggie' has been arrested after police found 23 grams of marijuana hidden under his stomach fat. The unusual hiding spot was discovered by police when they pulled over a vehicle after noticing 450 pound Florida man Christopher Mitchell, 42, was not wearing a seat belt. The packet of marijuana was hidden on Mitchell, while traces of cocaine, a handgun and cash were found in the vehicle during the routine traffic stop. Police found the drugs underneath Mitchell's stomach fat after he appeared nervous when questioned . Mitchell is known locally as 'Fat Boy' or 'Biggie', according to the New York Daily News. According to police documents, when Mitchell and driver Keithian Roberts, 38 were pulled over, Mitchell told police he was too big to fit the seat belt. Police reported they both appeared nervous and the car was covered in carpet freshener and scented dryer sheets - typically used to mask the smell of drugs while being transported. A sniffer dog was then called in and police collected 1g of cocaine from the vehicle and a packet of marijuana concealed underneath his large belly. Driver Keithian Roberts, 38, was arrested for possession of cocaine following the police search . A handgun and sock full of cash were also taken from the vehicle.

"Hillary Clinton was heckled a half-dozen times today during a campaign stop for Maryland Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, who is seeking the state's top job. Clinton was just a few minutes into her remarks at the University of Maryland's College Park campus when a group of five protesters holding signs that said 'choose families over politics' began shouting at her about immigration. 'You know immigration's an important issue,' Clinton told them. The presumed 2016 presidential candidate tried to talk over the noisy group. But the crowd of several hundred people came to her aid and drowned the protesters out by cheering and chanting, 'HILLARY! HILLARY!' Scroll down for video . Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, center, gives remarks at a campaign rally for Lieutenant Gov. Anthony Brown, right, Democratic nominee for Maryland governor, and Ken Ulman, left, Democratic candidate for Lt. Gov., at the University of Maryland in College Park today. Clinton was interrupted a half-dozen times by hecklers . Eventually Clinton got her speech back on track and she finished strong, talking about the type of future she wanted her granddaugher Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky to have . When the commotion died down, Clinton told the protesters, 'You know if they had just waited a little while, I was getting to the DREAM Act.' After the group was escorted out, Clinton said she was 'proud to be in state that has opened the doors of opportunity to students who work and study hard, regardless of their parents' immigration status'. As a Senator, Hillary said she was proud to sponsor federal DREAM Act legislation, which would have granted legal status to people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. The legislation failed to pass, but President Obama enacted much of its language unilaterally in 2012. 'I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, and I believe that we have to fix our broken immigration system,' she explained. 'We have to treat everyone with dignity and compassion, uphold the rule of law and respect our heritage as a nation of immigrants, [trying] to build a better life, bringing millions of hard-working people out of the shadows...' No Clinton got back on track, she was interrupted again. 'You know when you've been doing this as long as I have or [Maryland Sen. Barbara] Mikulski or [Maryland Sen. Ben] Cardin, it's important to keep moving forward, and yes, of course we want people to be advocates,' she tried to say, but she was cut off a third time. The former first lady then attempted to shift topics to her support for equal pay for equal work, but the hecklers, spread throughout the gymnasium, wouldn't let her. Throughout the 20 minute speech, Clinton was heckled six separate times, though it was not immediately clear if all of her critics were immigration reform advocates working together, or if they were supporting different causes. An organizer for United We Dream told Politico after the event that more than two dozen supporters of the group were sprinkled throughout the crowd, however. 'I think she avoided the question like she has in the other events where we’ve tried to connect with her before,' the organizer, Greisa Martinez, said. 'I know that Hillary Clinton is a very intelligent woman and she knows exactly what we are talking about… it’s not about the DREAM Act and it’s not about immigration reform…it’s about administrative relief, and so to hear her use that as a cop out to” avoid answering was frustrating.' President Barack Obama was similarly interrupted when he appeared in Maryland on Brown's behalf two weeks ago at an early vote rally. Unfazed: Mrs Clinton left the hall in good spirits despite being heckled five times during the speech in heartland Democratic territory . Crowd: Mrs Clinton was speaking in a sports hall in support of the Democratic campaign for the Maryland governor's house when hecklers struck . Hand in hand: Hillary Clinton raises the hand of Maryland gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown after the heckling at the rally, at Ritchie Coliseum at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland . Before there were jeers for Clinton there were loud cheers as she took the stage. 'Join me in welcoming Charlotte's grandmother, my friend and yours, Hillary Rodham Clinton,' Brown, the state's Democratic nominee for governor, told the crowd as Clinton entered the room to Pharrell Williams' song Happy. Clinton acknowledged the title change later in her remarks. 'I felt pretty good about that. I'm not sure I've been introduced before as Charlotte's grandmother.' The Clintons' only daughter Chelsea gave birth to her first child, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, in late September. 'Obviously,' she said, her family has spent a lot of time 'thinking about this little baby's future.' And we are 'going to do everything we can to make sure she has every opportunity, good schools, good health.' 'We'll absolutely be committed to making that happen,' Clinton said. 'But then I think about what will it be like for her in 20, 25 years, when like so many of you, she's going to be starting her adult life,' Clinton told the university students. 'What will our country be like?' she asked. 'Will we will have the commitment to the American Dream that I was raised with? Anthony was raised with? The feeling that yeah, you had to work hard, you had to get an education, you had to do your part, but the opportunities were going to be there.

'So of course I want for my granddaughter that type of future,' she noted, but Clinton said she also wants other peoples' children to have those opportunities. Repeating a now-familiar line in her stump speech, Clinton said that Americans should not have to be the relative of a president or secretary of state to be ensured a fair shake in life. That's why it's so important that Democrats in the audience do everything they can to convince people who are 'tuned out to turn out' in next Tuesday's election she said.

"An exasperated California family is in the extraordinary position of being unable to evict their live-in nanny who is refusing to work and refusing to leave their home. Marcella Bracamonte, 31, claims that nanny, Diane Stretton, 64, is threatening to sue her family for wrongful dismissal and abuse of the elderly and incredibly, has told them she wants them out of their own house daily between 8am and 8pm. Upland resident, Bracamonte, and her husband Ralph, hired Stretton on March 4 using Craigslist to help with their three children, ages 11, four and one, but when they tried to evict her police told them they could do nothing. Scroll Down for Video . Stumped: Marcella and Ralph Bracamonte with their three children, ages, 11, 4 and one . Disbelief: Marcella Bracamonte and her husband Ralph (right) are at their wits end with their nanny Diane Stretton . Dispute: Diane Stretton, 64, is suffering from COPD and has declined to move out of the Bracamonte's home because of their legal dispute . 'The first few weeks she was awesome,' said Bracamonte to ABC News about her squatter. 'She would come places with us, help out the kids. She was really great.' But overnight things changed for the stay at home mother and her electrical contractor husband. 'All of a sudden she stopped working, she would stay in her room all day and only come out when food was ready,' said Bracamonte. Stretton told Ralph and Marcella that she was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and that she was unable to leave her room and help with the kids. Initially concerned for her, the Bracamonte's decided that they couldn't have her living in their home anymore when she simply refused to do anything around the house. However, serious problems began on June 6 when they came to her with what they called a 'last chance letter', which outlined the terms of their initial agreement and threatening her with eviction if she continued to do nothing. Silent treatment: When local news asked the nanny why she had not left the home yet they received no reply . Stretton has even filed paperwork to try and force the Bracamontes OUT of their own home, pictured here . Stretton refused to sign it and said that she would be leaving in 30 days anyway as the stress of the job had become too much for her. At this point they asked the 64-year-old to leave and served her with legal papers, but Stretton counter-sued and a judge ruled in her favor because the Bracamonte's did not complete a three-day quit notice correctly. 'When I asked her why she wouldn’t sign the letter she said ‘It’s not legal,’ and slammed the door in my face,' Bracamonte told ABC News. 'Once she said the word legal, I knew it wasn’t going to be fun.' Police told the Bracamonte's there was nothing they could do. 'They told me it was now a civil matter,' Bracamonte said, 'and I have to legally evict her,' said Marcella Bracamonte to CBS2. 'So this lady is welcome inside my house, anytime she wants,  to eat my food anytime she wants and harass me basically. I’m now a victim in my home and it’s completely legal.' Legal problems: The Bracamonte's have said that they can't believe the battle to have Stretton removed . John Moore of the Upland Police Department confirmed to ABC News they cannot do anything at the moment because, 'generally, once somebody has established residency, you have to go through a formal eviction process.' Ralph Bracomnte said that his frustration is like a nightmare. 'Now, this person is in our house,' he said to CBS2, 'and I have to go to work. My kids are still here, my wife is still here. She towers over my wife, my kids. And I know there is nothing I can do about it.' And as the Bracamonte's discovered, this was not the first time that Stretton has clashed in the courts with family's. She has been involved in 36 lawsuits, ensuring she has made California's Vexatious Litigant list, for abusing the system. 'Anyone who looks at her crooked, she sues,' said Bracamonte. Stretton is now threatening to sure for wrongful dismissal and abuse of the elderly while she eats their food and sleeps in their house. She has even told the family she wants them to be out of their own house between 8am and 8pm. 'I’m not going to bend for her,' said Bracamonte. 'I’m in charge, this is my house. She’s not going to scare me out of my own house.' The Bracamontes know the eviction process can take a while but they wanted to speak out to warn other families.","Diane Stretton, 64, is squatting in the home of Marcella and Ralph Bracamonte in Upland, California .

"An employee at a veterans' affairs hospital in Arizona has come forward - and claimed that veterans' records were intentionally falsified and their medical requests hidden. Whistle-blower Pauline DeWenter, an appointment scheduler at the Phoenix VA, said in an exclusive interview with CNN she would note on records if veterans died before they could receive treatment. However, she said someone had changed dead veterans' records seven times, if not more, to make it seem they were alive. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Pauline DeWenter, pictured, has claimed the Phoenix VA intentionally made it seem that patients who died waiting for appointments were actually alive . DeWenter told CNN's Drew Griffin 'by doing that, that placed (the veterans) back on the wait list' and let the hospital hide deaths. 'I would say (it was done to) hide the fact,' DeWenter said. 'Because it is marked a death. And that death needs to be reported. So if you change that to, ""entered in error"" or, my personal favorite, ""no longer necessary,"" that makes the death go away. So the death would never be reported then.' As part of the interview, DeWenter said she was told to hide new patient requests in a 'secret list' hidden inside a desk drawer. DeWenter also said that because of a 1,700-person waiting list in 2013, she was forced to determine which patients could receive treatment - while at the same time was pressured by hospital staff to schedule appointments for other ill veterans. Pressure: DeWenter said because of a 1,700-person waiting list in 2013, she was forced to determine which patients could receive treatment - while at the same time was pressured by hospital staff to schedule appointments for other ill veterans . 'And that really overtook even the wait list,' DeWenter told CNN. 'Because now I have a consult where veterans are very sick. So I have to ease up on the wait list. It sounds so wrong to say, but I tried to work these scheduled appointments so at least I felt the sickest of the sick were being treated.' DeWenter decided to take action after she called a veteran to take him off the wait list, but found out he had died while waiting, CNN reported. She later worked with Dr. Sam Foote and contacted the VA's Office of the Inspector General - and when nothing came of it, Foote spoke to the media. DeWenter told CNN she 'submitted evidence' to authorities.","Whistle-blower Pauline DeWenter, an appointment scheduler at the Phoenix VA, said that dead veterans' records had been changed by someone else to make it seem they were alive at least seven times .

"The author of the new James Bond book, says he deliberately wrote about women and African people 'not in a way Fleming would write them'. William Boyd, the third writer in recent years to pen a new installment to the classic spy series, said he found it difficult to read the descriptions . of 'negros' and chapters entitled 'Nigger Heaven'. Boyd, who was born in Ghana in 1952 and spent his childhood travelling between Africa and his Scottish boarding school Gordonstoun, said: 'It's unbelievable to read now. I think if you were of that privileged upper class, born at the . beginning of the 20th century, you were probably racist, sexist, right . wing and anti-Semitic.' Departure: William Boyd says he had great respect for Ian Fleming, but his own work was better written . The writer, whose works include bestsellers such as . Restless, said he admired Ian Fleming's style, but chose to write in his . own way in the novel Solo, which will be published on Thursday. And although Boyd's 007 is in bed with a beautiful woman by page 86 of the novel, he said he had written about the spies relationships with women differently, saying of Fleming's novels: 'The sex can veer from terrible Barbara Cartland romanticism to almost sadism. 'I deliberately wrote those scenes well, not in the way Fleming would write them,' he said. The 61-year-old admitted in an interview with The Times that he had had arguments . with the Fleming estate, which authorised him to write the new novel, . over his plot line that made Bond into an assassin. Sexist: Boyd says he wanted to depart from the sometimes 'sadistic' treatment of women in Fleming's novels . Boyd said he had a high regard for Fleming, having featured him as a character in his novel Any Human Heart, saying the novelist would be his specialist subject on Mastermind. He has written the scripts for films that have involved Bond actors Daniel Craig, Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan. Boyd said he felt his style matched the sentiment of the original Bond books - although he accepted that some hard-core 007 fans might be disappointed with his decision to tweak the original writer's style, even having his spy drive a Jensen rather than a Bentley or an Aston Martin.

"A transsexual former inmate of Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada who claims to have had a sexual fling with O.J. Simpson while in prison has revealed she is HIV positive and may have infected the disgraced football great. Former prostitute Jazmena Jameson has described in detail the alleged one-off encounter she shared with 67-year-old Simpson while serving time in 2013. In a new interview with Radar Online, Jameson said she got to know the former NFL star - who has been in Lovelock since 2008 following a bungled Las Vegas robbery - while working as the lead porter for the laundry room and would deliver clothes to his cell every other day. Describing herself as exceedingly flirtatious and the 'closest thing to a woman' in the prison, Jameson said she and Simspon would often 'joke around and stuff'. 'Steamy prison fling': Jazmena Jameson (right) claims to have given O.J. SImpson (left) 'oral sex' in his prison cell at Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada in 2013. She is HIV positive . 'Flirtatious': Jameson, a former transsexual prostitute, says she would openly flirt with Simpson while delivering his laundry, and that their relationship advanced when she exposed her breasts to him . 'Finally one day he said, ''You have big t---ies. Are those implants or the hormone shots?'',' Jameson told Radar. 'And he wanted to see them - I don't mind showing anyone, you know, so I ended up showing them to him. 'He said, ''You better get up out of here!''.' Nothing happened between them that day, Jameson maintained. However when she was back in the cell about a month later, Jameson claimed she started to dance for Simpson, before making an advance. 'I walked up on him and said, ''You can stop me if you want to'',' she said. 'I knew he wasn't going to stop me. 'I ended up having oral sex with him.' Jameson told Radar that Simpson ejaculated on his own stomach. She also told the website that she is HIV positive. Scene: O.J. Simpson is currently serving 33 years - with a non-parole period of nine years - in the treeless Lovelock Correctional Facility in the Nevada desert . There is little data that exists that calculates the risk of contracting HIV from giving or receiving oral sex. However, according to HIV resource The Body Pro, a review published in 2008 and concluded that vaginal and penile oral sex pose a 'low but non-zero transmission probability'. The alleged relationship between Jameson and Simpson was outed earlier this week by The National Inquirer. Radar Online were then able to secure an interview with her. Earlier this week it was revealed that American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy will be doing a TV mini-series based on the O.J. Simpson. American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson will be based on Jeffrey Toobin's book The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson, according to Entertainment Weekly. The 10-episode series will look at the Simpson trial from the viewpoint of the lawyers. TV pundits are now buzzing with who might portray Simpson. Back in court: Simpson, now 67, is pictured here in May 15, 2013 in Las Vegas, attempting to have his armed robbery and kidnapping conviction reversed . Simpson will be eligible for parole in 2017. In 2008 he was sentenced to 33 years prison with a non-parole period of nine years. The case involved a Las Vegas hotel room confrontation over sports memorabilia in 2007. Simpson said the items had been stolen from him and he had been trying to recover them. However a jury found him guilty of 12 charges, including armed robbery and kidnapping. In 1995 a Los Angeles jury controversially acquitted him of killing the 1994 murder of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman.

"Marie Harf, the embattled State Department deputy spokeswoman who insisted this week that helping ISIS jihadis find gainful employment was a better strategy than killing them, is not in line for a promotion when her boss moves to the White House on April 1, a State Department official said Thursday. Harf said Monday night on MSNBC that 'lack of opportunity for jobs' in the Middle East should be America's focus in the war against the ISIS terror army. She refused to back down Tuesday night on CNN, insisting that the Obama administration should 'get at the root causes' of terrorism. 'It might be too nuanced an argument for some,' she sniped at her legions of critics. Those mockworthy moments, a State Department official said Thursday, 'are going to keep her from the top job.' Marie Harf has hit her career ceiling as the State Department's deputy spokeswoman, according to an official, since her recent TV appearances didn't inspire confidence in her ability to take the top job . State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, shown during Thursday's press briefing, will become President Barack Obama's new communications director, and is expecting a child in the summer . ELITIST SNOB ON CAMERA TWO? Harf said the need to look at things like governance, like opportunity' in counterterrorism plans 'might be too nuanced an argument for some' 'Jen's move to the White House isn't something that happened overnight,' the official said, 'and Marie's TV appearances were an audition of sorts, a test run, and she failed spectacularly.' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki will become President Barack Obama's new communications director, replacing Democratic media strategist Jennifer Palmieri, who will join Hillary Rodham Clinton's likely presidential campaign. In a statement, Obama embraced Palmieri as a 'good friend' and praised her as a 'brilliant and effective communications director and trusted adviser.' 'I'd say Jen is irreplaceable – if Jen Psaki hadn't agreed to step in...' Obama said. 'I fully trust Jen – and I am thrilled she's agreed to come back to the White House as communications director.' Psaki took issue with the characterization of Harf's situation as a dead-end, telling Daily Mail Online after this story was published that 'anyone who is commenting anonymously on personnel decisions is not a decision maker.' 'Marie Harf is a smart, savvy, integral member of the State Department team who has run point on issues ranging from the Iran negotiations to efforts to degrade and defeat ISIL,' Psaki said. Reporters in a State Department briefing on Thursday congratulated her on the promotion, while noting that her unorthodox approach to the job has drawn detractors. 'You will be missed by us and, I'm sure, by your legion of fans around the world,' an Associated Press reporter said drily, bringing a chorus of laughter from the press corps. Psaki drew the most criticism for implementing what Republicans have derided as 'hashtag diplomacy,' using messages on Twitter to express State Department positions from a distance without directly engaging foreign powers and murderous rebel groups. Psaki will be returning to the White House where she helped craft Obama's message during the president's first term. She has been part of Obama's team since 2007, when she was traveling press secretary during his first presidential campaign. The move allows Obama to replace a senior adviser with a familiar aide who is already steeped in issues confronting the White House. Psaki has become a frequent face of the State Department as spokeswoman for Secretary of State John Kerry, often traveling the world. Although she came from the Obama camp, she was seen as close to Kerry and accurate in conveying his policy positions. A White House official said Psaki informed Obama and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough that she is expecting a baby in July. The official said Obama and McDonough made a commitment to Psaki to find flexible ways to make her new post work. Psaki will serve as an assistant to the president, the same status as White House press secretary Josh Earnest. Outgoing White House communications director Jen Palmieri will helm press operations for Hillary Clinton's mascent presidential campaign operation . Psaki will rejoin deputy communications director Amy Brundage, with whom she worked during the 2008 campaign and in 2010 when they undertook the media strategy for Obama's economic agenda. Obama's communications team has been focused on pushing the domestic policy ideas he spelled out in his State of the Union speech. But Psaki would no doubt also be involved in helping shape the White House message on the myriad international issues confronting the president, including Ukraine, Israel, Iran and the Islamic State militants. Palmieri is part of a White House exodus of top advisers. John Podesta, who served as counselor to the president, also stepped aside to take a senior role in Clinton's expected campaign. And senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer, an Obama veteran from his first presidential campaign, has announced he is leaving. Obama replaced Podesta with Brian Deese, a veteran White House aide and a deputy director in his budget office. With Deese and Psaki, Obama is signaling that he wants to rely on known insiders to advise him during what he has called the 'fourth quarter' of his presidency.","White House will move State Dept. spokeswoman Jen Psaki in when its communications director joins Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign .

"An Episcopal priest who was born a woman but is now living as a straight man is the first transgender clergy to give a sermon at the National Cathedral. The Reverend Dr Cameron Partridge, the Episcopal chaplain at Boston University, offered a sermon from the iconic Canterbury Pulpit as part of the church's celebration of LGBT pride month. In the sermon, he said gay, lesbian and transgender people can be so consumed by despair and oppression that they fail to see the love of Jesus. Scroll down for video . Reverend Dr Cameron Partridge is the first only-transgender person to give a sermon at the National Cathedral in Washington . The sermon Sunday focused on LGBT issues and faith, especially the trouble that many transgender people face as they are deciding to change their gender, he said . Rev Partridge was joined at the pulpit by the Right Reverend Gene Robinson, the first openly gay Episcopal bishop. The Very Rev. Gary Hall, dean of the cathedral, says he hopes Partridge's appearance 'will send a symbolic message in support of greater equality for the transgender community.' Rev Partridge encouraged gay and transgender people to look for resilience and strength in Christianity. 'So many people in the LGBTQ community, and particularly in the trans community, have at one point or another or for a lifetime found ourselves in situations of intense oppression, isolation and despair,' he said, according to the Washington Times. 'We have been utterly unable to see beyond the horizon of our often multiple, intersectional margins.' The National Cathedral, one of the most iconic churches in the United States - and the second largest - was built between 1907 and 1910 . Rev Cameron Partridge was born Katherine. She came out as lesbian while attending the all-women Bryn Mawr College. Later, after graduating from Harvard Divinity School, she began the process of transitioning from female to male. He completed the process in 2001. Rev Partridge's female partner, who was with him when he was a woman, has stuck by his side. They are now living as a straight couple with two young children in suburban Boston.","Reverend Dr Cameron Partridge is the Episcopal chaplain at Boston University and a teacher at Harvard Divinity School .

"A central London penthouse has become Britain's most expensive ever flat after a wealthy Eastern European reportedly bought it for £140million - despite it not having any furnishings, flooring or internal walls. The 16,000sq ft 'core and shell' property is part of the exclusive One Hyde Park development in Knightsbridge, and is believed to have been purchased by a man from Russia or Ukraine. Concrete walls, floor-length windows and one of the most exclusive views in the world is all the new homeowner will have got for his money. Record: The unfurnished penthouse flat is one of four at the exclusive One Hyde Park apartments in Knightsbridge (pictured), and is believed to have been purchased by a man from either Russia or Ukraine . Experts estimate he will have to spend . hundreds of thousands more dividing the penthouse into rooms and . installing the luxuries befitting one of the country's most expensive . addresses. According to the property's developers, after the flat is fully furnished it could command prices of between £160million and £175million. As part of the deal the new owner will also have access to the services of 80 hotel staff who maintain the properties and provide housekeeping, room service and security. The property - known as Penthouse D - is one of four at One Hyde Park, and consists of the entire top floor of one of the towers, which sit between Knightsbridge and the southern border of Hyde Park, five minutes walk from Harrods department store. The sale was today confirmed by the property developers. It is thought the deal has been in the works for months. Properties costing most than £2million attract high rates of stamp duty - which for this penthouse could hit £21million. The rate for properties bought by individuals is capped at 7 per cent - in this case £9.8million - but if a corporate body purchased it on the man's behalf, stamp duty is charged at 15 per cent - which would be £21million. A spokesman for CPC Group, the developers of the property, told MailOnline: 'A 16,000 sq ft duplex Penthouse (Penthouse D) at One Hyde Park was recently sold. CPC Group is not able to comment on the sale price or the purchaser'. Describing the currently bare property, the spokesman continued: 'It's a shell and core unit - concrete walls, concrete floors, no rooms or walls put in yet - the owner can decide on their preferred layout for their needs or lifestyle. Luxury: When the One Hyde Park apartments first went on sale at the start of 2011, every inch of their polished marble floors contrasted sharply with the state of Britain's economy, which was deep in recession (file image) Demand: One Hyde Park has become a 'luxury ghetto' for some of the world¿s richest people, including Arab sheikhs, Nigerian oil tycoons and Naomi Campbell's former boyfriend, Vladislav Doronin (file image) 'They can decide how many bedrooms, kitchens, or whatever it is they want. The property runs the length of the building - from the park side to the city side. At one end you’ll have views of Hyde Park, and at the other end you’ll have views of Knightsbridge and Harrods and so on. You only get that in the penthouses and in the five-bedroom units, where you get the entirety of one level.' The value for the sale and nationality of the buyer was reported in The Times. All four penthouses in the development are now spoken for, and the only One Hyde Park property still on offer from the developers is a three-bedroom flat, which is likely to be worth around £15million. It is thought that a flat in Britain has never sold for so much before. In 2011 another One Hyde Park penthouse was sold for £136million. It was also reported last year that a mansion in Mayfair - 18 Carlton House Terrace - was on the market for £250million, but it is not clear whether a sale was made. As well as being a new high-water mark in the property market, the suspected nationality of the buyer has added to evidence that rich Eastern Europeans are offloading their wealth into London in the wake of political unrest in Ukraine. It will also add to the mounting fears that Britain's property market - particularly in London, where foreign interest is high - is in danger of crashing. A report released by Nationwide yesterday warned that house prices across the board are rising at their fastest pace for nearly seven years. According to the research, the average home costing nearly £18,000 more than it did last year, building society said yesterday. Graham Beale, chief executive of the building society, warned: ‘We need to watch the situation carefully.’ In just one year, house prices have jumped by 10.9 per cent, the first time that annual house price inflation has been in double figures since 2010 and the highest rate since June 2007. New figures this week also revealed a booming trade in the most expensive houses, with 33 British homes selling for £1million or more every day. Concerns: A number of people, including Sir Jon Cunliffe (left), are worried that London's high-end property bubble may be about to burst. The Duke of Westminster (right) recently sold off £240million of luxury property . Land . Registry statistics reveal that in January this year there were 1,011 . houses sold in this  price bracket, with most going in London and the . South East. The figure is almost double that for January 2013. It . came as a deputy governor of the Bank of England issued a strong . warning that Britain’s housing market is spiralling out of control. Sir . Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor for financial stability, said the housing . market was a 'blinking warning light', and indeed 'the brightest light . on that dashboard'. He . added that it would be ‘dangerous to ignore the momentum that has built . up’, given the well-established history of boom-and-bust in the British . property market. However, not everyone is so optimistic about the future of luxury property in the capital. Earlier this week the property company owned by the . Duke of Westminster said it had sold £240million of luxury homes in central . London amid fears the capital's house price bubble may be about the . burst. Grosvenor Group said . it was cutting its exposure to high-end residential properties after . growing concerned that the rate of growth in the London luxury house . price market was unsustainable. The company - which is controlled by Gerard Grosvenor, . one of Britain's richest men - says it is branching out from its . traditional Mayfair and Belgravia turf, and targeting more affordable . rental homes south of the river in Bermondsey.","Penthouse D at One Hyde Park, Knightsbridge, was sold to either a Russian or a Ukrainian for record-breaking price .

"Prince Philip appeared to have a bleeding cut on his ear today, fuelling speculation that he might have hurt himself. The injury was visible as he followed his normal routine of walking 400 yards from Sandringham House to the morning service at St Mary Magdalene Church. Wearing his customary long brown overcoat, the 83-year-old who is renowned for his robust fitness did not show any sign of being concerned by the wound. Prince Philip revealed a bloody cut to his ear as he attended church with the Queen today near their Sandringham home . The injury didn't seem to bother the royal, who was in good spirits as he travelled to the venue on foot . He chatted and smiled as normal to a crowd of onlookers and paused to exchange a joke with a policeman who saluted him. While Prince Philip walked to the church, the Queen was taken to the venue in her Bentley. Her Majesty radiated in a bright fuchsia outfit, which she accessorised the quirky hat and coat with a beautiful pink and silver brooch, a pair of plain pearl earrings and a cerise lipstick. She has been staying an her 20,000-acre East Anglian home with Prince Philip since the Christmas break and regularly visits the nearby church for the Sunday sermon. The Queen livened up a cold morning with her bright Sunday best. She travelled in her chauffeur-driven Bentley to the St Mary Magdalene Church service . Several locals waited outside the place of worship to welcome the royal couple, despite the cold temperatures. They still have almost two weeks weeks in the countryside before they are expected to return to London.

"Life coach Iyanla Vanzant called out a man with 34 children - asking if he used birth control and ever considered getting a vasectomy - on her television show. Part of Vanzant's conversation with Jay Williams was revealed in a YouTube clip of 'Iyanla: Fix My Life' for OWN TV's YouTube channel. In the video, Williams holds dolls standing in for his children in his lap, with a pile of them lying behind him, The Huffington Post pointed out. Vanzant sits across from him on a porch. There are 17 mothers in total and and his children range in age from 3 to 26, the news site reported. 'So let me ask you this question, Jay,' she says in the clip. '34 children. At any point, did it dawn on you this is too much?' Scroll down for video . Confrontation: Iyanla Vanzant asked Jay Williams - who has 34 children - about a possible vasectomy. Williams told Vanzant he didn't want to undergo the procedure and 'I don't have a problem with what I've created' 'No,' Williams says. 'So a child at 15, you never said ""Let me use a condom?""' Vanzant asks. Williams replies 'I did use condoms.' Shocked, Vanzant leans in and asks 'How many?' 'I probably would have had 200 kids if I didn't use condoms,' Williams admits. 'Really?' Vanzant asks, with Williams nodding. 'Did it ever dawn on you, ""Let me get a vasectomy?""' Williams says 'No,' and when pressed, simply says 'I don't want one.' Gesturing toward the dolls, Vanzant insists 'But look what you've created!' Williams, holding the pile of dolls, says 'I don't have a problem with what I've created.' Vanzant points out that the stoned-faced Williams is holding them in a way that would hurt actual children. She asks, 'What can you do right now, holding these 14 babies? With all of them behind you that you don't even have your hand on? Father: Jay Williams claimed to use birth control, and said 'I probably would have had 200 kids if I didn't use condoms' 'What can you, one man, do right now?' she continues. 'Tell me, for these children, what can you do?' When Williams plunks the dolls down in a chair next to him, Vanzant asks 'Are you aware that you just thonked that baby's head on the chair?' She also points out a second doll is lying face-down on the ground. Vanzant goes on to grill Williams, who says he is 'tired of holding the dolls.' 'Okay, wait a minute,' Vanzant says, then starts to put the dolls his arms. 'I'm sorry, as a mom,' she continues, 'I don't get not to take care of my children, no matter what I'm thinking or feeling or going on. 'I had to figure out and find the time and the way to get myself handled, but, they were first,' she continues. 'And I didn't get to just put them down because it was inconvenient.'","Father Jay Williams was called out by Iyanla Vanzant in a video .

"Even for a Hollywood lothario with hundreds of adoring female fans taking a girl to an X-rated movie on the first date is a brave move. But as Bond girl Britt Ekland reveals, Warren Beatty's wooing tactics did the trick. She admits that even though she was surprised by his choice of date they both headed back to a hotel room together soon after exiting the cinema. Ekland, 27 at the time, tells Piers Morgan she wasn't 'a very forward girl', but was was seduced by Beatty, five years her senior. Britt Ekland at a Bond photocall in 2011 (l) and Warren Beatty at the AFI Life Achievement Award tribute, 2008 . Describing her encounter with the actor and director, she said while she thought he was 'pretty wonderful' for a while after that first date, her impression of him soon changed. 'I think he seduced me. I'm not a very forward girl. I wasn't then,' she said. 'Do you know what movie he took me to? And I have never told anyone - he took me to see a pornographic movie. I just wanted to get out of there. He had to leave too.' Asked where they headed then, she said: 'I guess back to the hotel. Wouldn't you if you were at a porn movie with me?' Ekland reveals much about her heartbreaks, including Rob Stewart's philandering and lack of remorse. The pair met in 1975 and fell 'madly in love' but, while she thought it would last forever, it wasn't to be. She said she found out he had cheated on her after a chance encounter at a party when she bumped into the actor George Hamilton, who broke the news. 'I wanted to throw up. I didn't believe it,' she said. 'I became anorexic and I had a really hard time, a really hard time. I had cocaine in those days when I was offered it.'

"Malaysia's highest court has upheld a ban on Catholics using the word 'Allah' to refer to their own god, ending a years-long legal battle. The verdict came in what was seen as a test case for the country's wider Christian congregation, but officials insist the verdict is confined to one Catholic newspaper. Worshippers can still use 'Allah' to refer to God in church, the government said. Scroll down for video . A Muslim woman wipes a tear while saying a prayer upon hearing the verdict banning a Catholic paper from using the word 'Allah'. Officials say the ruling applies only to that newspaper and not Christians in general . A cyclist rides past Gereja Sidang Jemaat Allah (Grace Assembly of God) Church in Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia on the day Malaysia's top court ruled that non-Muslims cannot use the word 'Allah' to refer to God . But the divisive case, in which the Catholic Church challenged a ban on its appropriation of the Arabic word, comes as minorities claim their rights are under threat from creeping Islamisation in Malaysia. The government had previously banned the use of 'Allah' in the local Malay-language edition of the Church's Herald newspaper. The use of the word had angered Muslims, who say Christians are overstepping religious boundaries. A seven-judge panel in Malaysia's administrative capital Putrajaya yesterday upheld a lower court decision which sided with the government's ban. But a government spokesman later clarified: 'The ruling only applies to the Herald newspaper's use of the word ""Allah"". Malaysian Christians can still use the word ""Allah"" in church.' Christians had argued that they had used the Arabic word to refer to God in Malay for centuries. 'The Christian community continues to have the right to use the word ""Allah"" in our Bibles, church services and Christian gatherings,' said Eu Hong Seng, chairman of the Christian Federation of Malaysia. Lawyers for the Catholic Church said they would explore new ways to challenge the ban. They fear the ruling could be used as a precedent to curtail religious freedom in other cases. Muslim women sit in front of a banner reading 'Allah' during a protest outside the Court of Appeal in Putrajaya, outside Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, yesterday, as the judges considered their verdict . Outside the court, amid tight . security, around a hundred Muslim activists cheered the news of the . verdict. Earlier, they had shouted 'Allahu Akbar' (God is great) and . waved banners that read, 'Uniting to defend the name of Allah'. 'We . must defend Allah because this is our religious obligation. I hope . other communities, including Christians, understand this,' Ibrahim Ali, . head of Muslim rights group Perkasa, told AFP. The . dispute first erupted in 2007 when Malaysia's home ministry threatened . to revoke the Herald's publishing permit for using the Arabic word in . its Malay-language edition. The . Church launched a court case to challenge the directive, arguing that . 'Allah' had been used for centuries in Malay-language Bibles and other . literature to refer to 'God' outside of Islam. But . authorities argued that using 'Allah' in non-Muslim literature could . confuse Muslims and entice them to convert - a crime in Malaysia. A Muslim man wears a shirt that leaves his opinion in no doubt as he and fellow protesters await the verdict . In . 2009 a court ruled in favour of the Catholic Church, sparking a spate . of attacks on houses of worship. Last October, an appeals court . reinstated the ban. Malaysia . has largely avoided overt religious conflict in recent decades, but . tensions have been growing. Two petrol bombs were thrown at a Malaysian . church in January, causing minor damage. Also in January, Islamic authorities seized hundreds of Bibles, which contained the word 'Allah', from a Christian group. The divisive case, in which the Catholic Church challenged a ban on its appropriation of the Arabic word, comes as minorities claim their rights are under threat from creeping Islamisation in Malaysia . Around 2.6million people among the Southeast Asian nation's 28million people are Christians, who come from mostly ethnic Chinese, Indian or indigenous backgrounds, while 60 percent are Muslim ethnic Malay. Minorities have long resented a decades-old positive discrimination policy which favours Malays in education, housing and employment. Prime Minister Najib Razak, who took office in 2009, has increasingly rolled back his initial reformist and conciliatory rhetoric in a bid to please hardliners of his United Malays National Organisation, which has ruled the country virtually uninterrupted since independence in 1957. 'The idea is to use this as a political weapon to raise tensions,' James Chin, a political science professor at Monash University, told AFP. 'They (the ruling party) feel that this is a vote-winner for the next election.'","Government insists ruling applies only to one Catholic newspaper .

"As temperatures rise across the U.S. and send people scurrying indoors to their air-conditioned homes, one man is doing things a little differently. Stan Cox of Salina, Kansas, where it is currently a boiling 109F, does not use air-conditioning even though he has got it in his home. Mr Cox, 54, says he saves money and the environment by keeping the air-conditioning switched off - and he rarely breaks into a sweat. Cool: Stan Cox of Salina, Kansas, where it is currently 109F, does not use air-conditioning at the home he shares with his wife even though they've got it . Mr Cox and his wife, Priti, use tricks in their home taught to them by older generations that help them to avoid overheating, reported ABC News. Mr Cox grew up without air-conditioning in Georgia and claims people have lost the social interaction on summer evenings they had in the past. ‘You'd see kids playing up and down the streets, people visiting one another on their front porches,’ he told ABC News. ‘Now the only sounds you hear are compressors running. Neighbourhoods look like they've been evacuated.’ More than 140 million Americans across 32 states are currently under heat advisories as the U.S. experiences a widespread heatwave. But agricultural scientist and author Mr Cox claims that by turning on your air-conditioning you’re actually making things worse. Not in my house: Mr Cox claims home air conditioning accounts for 60 per cent of electricity use in the South and he saves around $150 per month by not using it . ‘The headline irony here is that the hotter it gets in summer, the more we're using our a/c,’ he told ABC News. ‘The more we're doing that, the greater the emissions from power plants and probability we'll have even more intense heat waves in the future.’ He has already put forward this view in a piece for the Washington Post last July, which resulted in a postbag of hate mail and even death threats. Mr Cox claims home air conditioning accounts for 60 per cent of electricity use in the South and he saves around $150 per month by not using it. The average U.S. household spends more than $275 per year on air-conditioning although local costs vary significantly. He also believes there would be a fall in obesity if children and adults were to spend more time outdoors and be more active. Mr Cox claims a Japanese study found air conditioning cuts down on cortisol production by the adrenal glands, which gets you out of bed.","Stan Cox stay cools with no a/c in 109F Kansas .

"Casey Anthony’s clothing and personal items are now being sold on a controversial website that caters to crime scene enthusiasts and people obsessed with her murder trial. The items are on sale for $800 apiece to buyers seeking so-called 'murderabilia,' a term used for collectibles related to murders, murderers and violent crimes. The macabre hobby has been forced underground for the last decade after eBay banned the sale of murderabilia in 2001, but business is reportedly booming. Acquitted: Casey Anthony (right) was found not guilty of the murder of her daughter Caylee (left) but remains a figure of hate . Write caption here . Yours for $800: For the price of a high-end designer handbag, a buyer could own this used black purse that allegedly belonged to Casey Anthony . The items that purportedly belonged to . Casey Anthony being sold for such exorbitant prices include several . pairs of capri pants, checkered shorts and handbags. Florida-based Serial Killers Ink is selling the items that are said to have originated from a garage . sale held at the Anthony family home on June 28 last year. Anthony was acquitted of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee in . 2011. ‘We are proud to offer for sale a number of items believed to be worn by Casey Anthony, one of the most notorious figures in American criminal history,’ says Eric Holler, the owner of Serial Killers Ink. ‘Casey Anthony may not have been convicted of murder, but she has become a pop culture icon, right up there with Jodi Arias and Myra Hindley.’ According to reports, Casey’s parents George and Cindy Anthony held the yard sale, charging neighbors for secondhand clothes and toys. An onlooker, Christina Werner told reporters, ‘I drove by and noticed the house looked familiar to me, I had seen this house before. I got close and noticed that the people outside really looked like George and Cindy Anthony. It was the home of Casey Anthony’s grandparents.’ Dealing in death: Eric Holler (right) makes his living selling murderabilia . Collectors items: Patterned shorts and a colorful drawstring bag that allegedly belonged to Casey Anthony are, according to Eric Holler, 'important historical artifacts' At the sale, pink and purple heart-shaped lockets, tiny combs and teddy bears were among the children’s items hawked for prices as low as $1.00. Now the items are available to buyers who are apparently willing to pay big money for creepy murderabilia - or in the case of Anthony's possessions, cheap cotton pants and used handbags. According to Holler, there is still a huge demand for personal items associated with Anthony even though she remains in hiding and has been staying out of the public eye. ‘There are private collectors who will pay big money for any memorabilia surrounding the case,’ he says. 'These items will be displayed at conventions and in museums. They are important historical artifacts.’ Odd fascination: Collectors are willing to pay $800 to own an item of clothing Casey Anthony, acquitted of murdering her toddler daughter, may have once worn . Anthony’s trial gripped the nation, and she served prison time after a jury convicted her of lying to investigators. Collectors . of murderabilia seek artifacts used or owned by murderers. Weapons used . in crimes and clothing worn during the perpetration of crimes is of . particularly high value, but anything is marketable. Other highly sought-after items include poetry or artwork created by the disturbed minds of killers, known as 'killer art.' Serialkillersink.com regularly sells . autographs, artwork, documents, locks of hair, photos and clothing from . killers such as Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, 'Night Stalker' Richard . Ramirez, and 'Killer Clown' John Wayne Gacy. Eric Holler says, 'I don't condone their crimes. But I have a right to sell these pieces. Business is booming.' The recent sale of the artwork of George Zimmerman on eBay for $100,000 could be said to be in violation of eBay's ban on murderabilia. Someone paid $150 for this signed picture of Night Stalker Richard Ramirez (left), and another paid $700 for this artwork by the murderer (right) Greetings from a serial killer: This card inscribed by Ted Bundy sold for $3,000 and is described as 'an amazing piece perfect for display!' The ghoulish market for clothing, letters and art created by serial killers has been slammed by victims charities, which claim the trade destroys the dignity of crime victims. In recent months, Holler has even cashed in on dirt, taken from the home where Cleveland Strangler Anthony Sowell buried 11 victims, selling it for $25 a gram. The business has stirred controversy in the past by offering for sale art by John Wayne Gacy, including a piece called ‘Single Witch’ that sold for $1000. Gacy was known as the ‘Killer Clown’, and was convicted of the sexual assault and murder of more than 33 teenage boys and young men. The website has also sold art and letters written by Charles Manson, Richard Ramirez, and Ted Bundy. Anthony will not benefit from the sale of the clothes, and it will not help her financial situation after filing for bankruptcy in March. Currently unemployed, Anthony claimed she is not receiving any money in book and TV deals, and is living on the kindness of strangers. Holler says the items have been laundered, and that no personal items of Caylee Anthony, including toys, are being offered for sale.","There is a big market for 'murderabilia'

"A Pakistani labourer and his pregnant wife killed for alleged blasphemy were locked inside a brick-making factory before their murder to prevent them from fleeing their debts, relatives said today. Shehzad Masih and Shama Bibi - who was four months pregnant and a mother to three children - were then beaten, surrounded by a 1,500 strong crowd and thrown on top of a brick kiln, witnesses said. The killing was sparked by the mob's belief the couple had desecrated a copy of the Koran. By the time the attack was over, only charred bones and the couple's discarded shoes remained. The gruesome incident took place yesterday in the tiny hamlet of Chak 59 near Kot Radha Kishan town, 60 kilometres southwest of Lahore. Scroll down for video .

A man surveys the site of the brick kiln where the Christian couple were murdered yesterday . Police and locals pictured at the site of their death.

Relatives of a Christian couple who were burnt alive for alleged blasphemy cry at their house in Kot Radha Kishan, near Kasur, Pakistan . Pakistani Christians lay floral wreaths at the brick kiln where a Christian couple was burnt alive . The killing has sparked protests by Christians and outrage among rights activists, while police have arrested 44 suspects. Jawad Qamar, a local police official, has now explained that local suspicions of blasphemy unfolded more than a week earlier with the death of Shehzad's father, a local religious healer. 'When he died, Shehzad's wife went to his room and cleaned up the mess. There was a trunk in his room. Shehzad's wife took the things that could be useful and threw the trash in front of her house. 'The garbage collector collected the trash the next day and told a local cleric that he had collected pages of the Koran thrown in front of Shehzad's house from the trash.' However, Shehzad's older brother said he and his whole family are bonded workers paying off their debts to the brick kiln owner - a man named Mohammed Yousuf. 'We take advance money from the owner and work for him, it has been going on for years. On November 3, the owner had called Iqbal  and detained him sensing that he might run away to save his life,' he said tearfully. The allegation against the factory owner was denied by his son Khawar Yousuf. He said: 'We don't know what has happened, the family has been working for us for 20 years and we have never noticed anything bad. 'It's wrong to say that my father locked them up.' Members of Pakistan's Christian community protest the couple's murder in Islamabad . Protesters in Faisalabad hold a sign condemning the 'brutal murder' of Shama Bibi and Shahzad Masih . Those who take part in blasphemy-related mob violence are rarely, if ever, prosecuted. Pictured are campaigners with a sign calling on politicians to ensure justice is done . Camera man  Malik Abdul Aziz, who witnessed the killing, has described first hand the brutal attack that unfolded. He said about 1,500 people gathered from nearby villages after being stoked up by local clerics who announced the couple had committed blasphemy over the loudspeakers of their mosques. 'They started beating the couple with sticks and bricks chanting slogans of ""We will lay down our lives for the honour of the prophet"" and then tore off their clothes. 'The couple were screaming, begging for mercy and saying they have not committed any sin. 'The mob dragged them for around 20 yards and laid them on top of the brick kiln oven and kept them there till they were burnt,' he added. It was not clear whether they were already dead or burnt alive. Pakistan minority rights campaigners in Kasur, near Lahore, carry a mock coffin in protest . Pakistani security officials have been placed on high alert since the married couple were killed near Lahore. Police have arrested 44 people for the lynching after the couple allegedly desecrated a copy of the Koran . A mob accused the couple of desecrating a copy of the Koran who then beat them and threw them into a kiln . The Christian couple were attacked in the town which is just 50 miles from Lahore and thrown into a kiln . Blasphemy is a hugely sensitive issue in the majority Muslim country, with even unproven allegations often prompting mob violence. Those who take part in the violence are rarely if ever prosecuted - a fact not lost upon the relatives of the deceased. 'I need justice but I am sure I won't be able to get it, the clerics are too powerful,' Shehzad's brother Iqbal said. Tahir Ashrafi, a member of the Council of Islamic Ideology, Pakistan's top religious body, held police responsible for failing to act to protect the couple before the mob violence occurred. 'This case must go to a anti-terrorism court and the culprits must be arrested and punished, including the mullah (who made the blasphemy accusation in mosque) if he's involved,' he said. Police chief Qamar stated that no particular sectarian group or religious outfit was behind the attack. Pakistan's brick kiln workers are often subject to harsh practices, with a study by the Bonded Labour Liberation Front Pakistan estimating that 4.5 million are indentured labourers. Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif constituted a three-member committee to fast track the investigation of the killings and ordered police to beef up security at Christian neighbourhoods in the province. Blasphemy charges, even when they go to court, are punishable by death in Muslim-majority Pakistan. Mohammad Asghar, left, from Glasgow, was shot last month in a Pakistani prison while he waited for his execution for blasphemy, his daughter Jasmine Rana, right, wants an investigation into her father's case . They are hard to fight because the law does not define clearly what is blasphemous. Presenting the evidence can sometimes itself be considered a fresh infringement. Christians make up about four per cent of Pakistan's population and tend to keep a low profile in a country where Sunni Muslim militants frequently bomb targets they see as heretical, including Christians, and Sufi and Shi'ite Muslims. All of Pakistan's minorities feel that the state fails to protect them, and even tolerates violence against them. Last month a British man with a history of mental health illness, sentenced to death for blasphemy earlier this year, was shot by a prison guard in his cell. Also in October, a Pakistani court upheld the death penalty against a Christian woman, Asia Bibi, who is also accused of blasphemy, in a case that drew global headlines after two prominent politicians who tried to help her were assassinated.","Christian couple were locked in factory after boss thought they'd flee debts .

"A young mother died from cancer after hospital doctors told her to cure a lump on her breast with primrose oil ointment. Samina Chaudhry, 33, from Northampton, went back several times to say the primrose oil treatment was not working. Two years later, doctors sent the biopsy for analysis but the cancer was so far advanced it could not be treated. A CT scan and MRI found multiple tumours on her brain. Samina Chaudhry was told to use ointment to cure a lump on her breast. Pictured with her sons Zeeshan, 13 and Usman, 11 . Her devastated husband Mohammed is now bringing up their two sons Zeeshan, 13, and Usman, 11, on his own. Samina first visited her GP in 2006 when she was just 27-years-old and she was referred to Northampton General Hospital. However, hospital doctors diagnosed a skin condition similar to eczema and advised her to treat it with primrose oil ointment. However, despite going back several times it wasn't until November 2008 that a biopsy was sent to be examined. 'When she was finally diagnosed, Samina aged in seconds. The blood just drained from her. It was devastating', Mohammed told The Sunday Mirror. 'My poor wife didn’t stand a chance.' Devastated: Mohammed Chaudhry photographed with his sons Zeeshan and Usman . Samina had a mastectomy as well as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Throughout her illness, she even carried on her job helping parents and young children at a Sure Start centre. However, in 2012 her condition deteriorated and Samina was admitted to a hospice. The mother decided to die at home and so the family living room was turned into a makeshift ward. Within a month, Samina had died. Following legal action Northampton General Hospital agreed to pay the family damages yesterday. The MailOnline is awaiting a comment from Northampton General Hospital.","Samina Chaudhry went back several times to say the oil was not working .

"Tragic: Davina Butchere, 13, died after accidentally hanging herself with a 10ft-long ribbon while playing on a bannister at home, an inquest has heard . A schoolgirl died after accidentally hanged herself with a 10ft-long ribbon while playing on a bannister at home, an inquest has heard. Davina Butchere, 13, was wearing a blue ribbon loosely around her neck when she slid down the stair bannister at her house in Allenton, Derby. As she reached the end, the strip of material got caught - causing her to slip and ending up hanged. The teenager was discovered by her brother with the ribbon looped around her neck and despite her family's desperate attempts to resuscitate her, she was pronounced dead. Now, a coroner at Derby and South Derbyshire Coroner's Court has ruled that Davina's death in 2009 was a 'tragic accident'. The court heard that the teenager's mother, Michelle Dove, had seen her daughter with the ribbon tied loosely around her neck, with the length of it trailing behind her, shortly before her death. The schoolgirl was said to have been in 'good spirits' after spending the day shopping with her mother and buying new clothes. But later that day, her brother, Davani, 12, ran to his mother, saying he had found his sister suspended after playing a game on the bannister. The schoolboy cut the ribbon from his sister's neck, while both her mother and stepfather, John Scrimshaw, started to perform CPR on her. Paramedics were called to the scene, but the teenager had already died, the court heard. Despite earlier rumours that the schoolgirl had taken her own life, Mrs Dove had always believed her daughter had been playing a game that had gone wrong. 'It was . like a door that couldn’t be shut because of the stigma around people . saying she had killed herself,' said Mr Scrimshaw, 42. Inquest: The schoolgirl was discovered by her brother with the ribbon looped around her neck. Now, a coroner at Derby and South Derbyshire Coroner's Court (pictured) has ruled that her death in 2009 was an 'accident' Sadly, Mrs Dove died aged 41 from a brain tumour last November - just months before Davina's death was ruled to be accidental. The court heard that, at the time of her death, Davina had been living at home under a care order following concerns about her relationship with her mother. Carol . Durand, Davina's social worker, told the inquest the teenager had been 'a very complex young person' and, at times, 'difficult to work with'. The schoolgirl, who had spent time in a children's home, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2008. Childhood: Davina, pictured as a child, was said to have been in 'good spirits' after spending the day shopping with her mother and buying new clothes . But, . Mrs Durand said, she had been very happy with the way Davina had been . since returning to her family home in June 2009. 'She seemed relaxed and comfortable and in the main was much happier to be at home,' said Mrs Durand. 'The whole time I saw her at home she was sparkly, chatty and happy.' She added that the description of Davina sliding down . the banister fitted her 'energetic' personality. 'Davina was a climber - if there was a tree . she would climb it,' she said. 'She was very tomboyish, very . active. She had lots of energy.' Detective Superintendent Rachel Walker told the inquest she believed Davina had slid down the banister, before becoming caught on the final post and falling off. She added: 'I don’t think there’s any foul play and that it was a tragic accident.' Assistant coroner Louise Pinder agreed, saying: 'There’s no evidence that Davina deliberately undertook this act, namely placing a length of ribbon around her neck and around the banister, with the intention of ending her life.' She concluded the schoolgirl had become suspended by the ribbon as a result of her 'playing on the stairs', causing her accidental death on September 7, 2009. Speaking after the inquest, Mr Scrimshaw said he and his wife had been making plans for their future when the tragedy struck. 'It was a tragic accident,' he said. 'Michelle was devastated and never really recovered because there was always a part of her missing. 'I tried to keep her spirits up but I know there were times when she felt like everything was closing in on her.' Distraught: The court heard that the teenager's mother, Michelle Dove (pictured in 2009), had seen her daughter with the ribbon tied loosely around her neck, with the length of it trailing behind her, shortly before her death . He said the family had been making plans for a fresh start in his wife's homeland of Tobago when the mother was diagnosed with a brain tumour. He said he had returned home from work one day in September 2012 to find Mrs Durand very weak and with slurred speech 'like she had had a stroke'. He took her to hospital where she diagnosed with a meningioma - a non-cancerous tumour - on her brain. Mrs Durand was transferred to the Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham for an operation, but never recovered consciousness after surgery. She remained in a coma until she died, 14 months later, in November last year. 'I visited her every day without fail,' said Mr Scrimshaw. 'When Michelle died, it completely devastated me. Before that, I hadn’t really dealt with the grief of Davina. 'I have lost everything, my dreams, the lot. But I hope that I can slowly climb back up to some normality. I now just have to take each day as it comes.'","Davina Butchere, 13, was wearing a blue ribbon loosely around her neck .

"Chick-fil-A restaurants became hotbeds of cultural tension yesterday when hundreds of thousands turned up at fast-food joints after the chain placed itself at the center of a row over gay marriage. Drive-through lanes were backed up and dining rooms packed as some diners showed support for the chain which was lambasted when the CEO said he opposes gay marriage. More than 640,000 people pledged to attend Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day - an event organized by former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee to support 'a company run by Christian principles'.

Similar scenes played out out outposts for the chain all across the country. 'I was drawn to Chick-fil-A this morning not only because it is Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day, but because the company supports the biblical definition of marriage,' Richard Norris, a first-time Chick-fil-A customer, told the Dallas Morning News. 'They’ve always stood for good Christian values.'

Counter-protest: Adrien Grimm, left, 18, and Nicole Latham,19, rallied outside the Chick-fil-A against the company's anti-gay marriage stance . Dan Cathy's remarks about his family's view of gay marriage have stirred up a national controversy around his family fast-food chain. However, Chick-fil-A has made Cathy a  billionaires, along with his father Truett Cathy and his brother Don. Dan Cathy runs the $4.5 billion company as president and CEO, while his elderly father, the founder, remains chairman. The company's bylaws stipulate that each of the Cathy brothers owns a third of the restaurant chain. The Cathys are devout Southern Baptists. They lose an estimated $47.8 million a year because they refuse to open any of their stores on Sunday. Despite this, Chick-fil-A enjoys one of the highest profit margins in the fast food industry and have the highest sales-per-restaurant of any fast food chain. Chick-fil-A has 1,600 stores -- mostly in the South, Southwest and Midwest. Many operate inside food courts in shopping malls, hospitals and universities. Southwestern Baptist Theological . Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, said it would buy 200 chicken sandwiches . for students, faculty and staff today to support the restaurant. Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and a Baptist minister, says he organized the event to defend the company, which has been lambasted in the media and criticized en mass by gay rights supporters. 'Too often, those on the left make corporate statements to show support for same sex marriage, abortion, or profanity, but if Christians affirm traditional values, we're considered homophobic, fundamentalists, hate-mongers, and intolerant,' Huckabee writes on Facebook. He says supporters are standing up for free speech, as well.. In Chicago, the state Republican party chairman has called for an invesitgation after Alderman Joe Moreno said he would block Chick-fil-A's expansion in the city, reports WLS 890AM.

'I am speaking up for him, and his First Amendment rights, and anybody else who would wish to express their not anti-gay people sentiment, but their support for traditional marriage,' she said on Fox News on Tuesday. Family values: Contrasting arguments by the restaurant that they are a restaurant based on family values, these protestors said 'hate' doesn't fall in line .

She added: 'President Obama and Joe Biden they both supported the exact same thing until just a few months ago when Obama had to flip flop to shore up the homosexual voter base.' At a rally for Cruz on Friday, she told a crowd that she made a point to stop at Chick-fil-A when she was Texas. 'We don’t have that in Alaska. Love me some Chick-fil-A,' she said to roaring cheers. One-time Republican primary front-runner Rick Santorum has also come out in support of the chain. Cathy . was quoted in a Baptist newspaper on July 16 saying he was 'guilty as . charged' when asked about his opposition to gay marriage.

Fighting back: Fox News commentator Mike Huckabee interviews supporters who came in for breakfast during Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day . Campaign stop: Texas Lt Gov David Dewhurst hoped to revive his ailing US senate bid by making a campaign stop at the restaurant . He later told a Christian radio show: 'I think we are inviting God's judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at Him and say, ""We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,"" and I pray God's mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude to think that we have the audacity to try to redefine what marriage is about.' Cathy says Chick-fil-A isn't a Christian company -- however its stores are all closed on Sunday, even in airports and shopping malls, and his company biography says the company's purpose is to 'glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us.' Chick-fil-A also puts its money where its mouth is, donating $5 million to Christian groups between 2003 and 2010. The company supported groups like the Family Research Council, which lobbies Congress on a host of conservative social issues -- including the prohibition of gay marriage.

Packed: In Enid, Oklahoma, Chick-fil-A customers lined up dozens deep, waiting for a sandwhich . Around the block: The line stretched well into the parking lot in at this store in California . Meanwhile, the company's employees are caught in the middle of the political row -- whether they agree with Cathy's comments or not. The Huffington Post interviewed several openly gay restaurant workers who said working for the company was difficult in light of the controversy because often times employees say homophobic things to them, thinking the comments are welcome at Chick-fil-A. An openly gay 24-year-old employee said a man came in and say he supported Cathy's comments then 'continues to say something truly homophobic, like ""I'm so glad you don't support the queers, I can eat in peace.""' Another gay employee added: '(It's) constantly having people come up to you and say, ""I support your company, because your company hates the gays.""'

"A newsreader has caused a stir in Saudi Arabia by shunning traditional Islamic dress to deliver a bulletin 'bare-headed'. The presenter was broadcasting from the London studio of Al Ekhbariya, a state-owned news channel which featured the Kingdom's first female newsreader when it launched a decade ago. Women often appear on Saudi TV without wearing headscarves or veils, but the appearance was thought by many to be the first by a newsreader on a government-owned station. Scroll down for video . Significant: Saudi news sites suggested it was the first time a presenter has read a bulletin without wearing a veil or headscarf on a state-owned news channel. The newsreader was broadcasting in Arabic from London . The bulletin last week prompted a string of reactions on Twitter and news stories on Saudi websites. A Twitter hashtag in Arabic circulated which translated roughly as #NewsEncouragesAdornments with one user, @HoNABIL, branding the channel 'Zionist enemies of religion'. Another, @maysaaX, remarked that it was a 'psychological jolt' for the conservative country. Several other users commented on how unusual the sight was, and some welcomed it as a step forward for personal freedom and women's rights. Clips and stills circulating online showed the newsreader in two outfits, suggesting she had opted not to wear a headscarf or veil for at least two bulletins. But the channel has disappointed those who hoped it was becoming more liberal, releasing a promise that the incident will not happen again. Spokesman Saleh Al Mughailif issued the statement after the clip was shared on several Arabic language news sites and viewed tens of thousands of times. According to Gulf News, he said: 'She was not in a studio inside Saudi Arabia and we do not tolerate any transgression of our values and the country’s systems'. He also played down the significance of the incident, emphasising the newsreader was simply 'a correspondent reading the news from a studio in Britain'. It is common for Saudi TV to feature women who are not wearing headscarves, but it usually only happens on foreign-made shows or when women feature as guests. Several Saudi commentators said it was believed to be the first time a female newsreader in the country had not worn a head covering. Those who hoped the incident was a step forward for women's rights in the conservative country would have been left disappointed, as the channel released a statement saying the incident would not happen again . Al Ekhbariya launched in January 2004 and its first bulletin made headlines by featuring the Islamic state's first female newsreader, who wore Western clothes with a hijab headscarf. The newsreader stopped short of wearing the niqab, the full face veil seen as a requirement in other parts of the country. The clip is the latest chapter in the long battle for women's rights in Saudi Arabia, which in October saw a landmark demonstration over its law preventing any woman from driving a car. Dozens of women got behind the wheel in full-face veils to protest in Riyadh, where the TV station is based. Apart from expats who live in the Kingdom, almost all Saudis follow Islam with the vast majority describing themselves as Sunnis.","Newsreader appeared on the Kingdom-owned Al Ekhbariya news channel .

"A couple accidentally booked a cheap flight to the Caribbean from the wrong Birmingham Airport - 4,000 miles away. Kevin Jones and his partner Jeanette were thrilled when they bagged two return flights to Trinidad for just £800. But when they arrived at the West Midlands hub, they were told their American Airlines flight was actually taking off from Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport - the biggest in the U.S. state of Alabama. Humbug! The tickets were booked by 55-year-old Kevin Jones, left, for himself and his partner Jeanette . Getaway: An American Airlines flight landing on the Caribbean island of St Maarten. Kevin Jones and his partner Jeanette were devastated to discover their 'bargain' flight was actually leaving from Birmingham, Alabama . Mr Jones, 55, from Glenfield, Leicester, told The Sun on Sunday: 'The girl at the information desk broke the news with a very sympathetic look that our flight was leaving over 2,000 miles away. 'We had no choice but to get our car out of long stay and drive home.' The pair are now on a bargain break in the Spanish resort of Benidorm instead, the newspaper reported. Despite the 4,200-mile distance between them, the two airports have some surprising similarities. They are a similar size and both went into service around the same time - the UK's version was commissioned in 1928, while flights began at the U.S. version in the same year. Hitting a Brum note: The pair thought they would be flying out of Birmingham Airport, pictured... Whoops: ...But they accidentally booked from the airport's namesake in the U.S. state of Alabama, pictured .

It is not the first mix-up involving a Caribbean flight.

"Police have so far tracked 48 'Facebook murders' in which killers used social media to hunt their prey or brag about sordid fantasies. Now UK scientists have identified six personality types that fit into this category in the first-ever study on how the social networking site can affect criminal behaviour. They believe each killer fits into the profile of either reactor, informer, antagonist, fantasist, predator or imposter. UK scientists have identified six personality types that fit into this category in the first-ever study on how the social networking site can affect criminal behaviour. They believe each killer fits into the profile of either reactor, informer, antagonist, fantasist, predator or imposter . A reactor is the most common type of killer, responsible for 27.1 per cent of Facebook murders. It describes someone who sees comments or photos that enrage them on Facebook, and they react violently with deadly force. An example is Wayne Forrester, who killed his wife Emma in 2008 after reading her Facebook posts, claiming that they had separated. An informer uses Facebook to tell others they intend to kill the victim, that they have killed the victim, or both. An antagonist engages in hostile exchanges on Facebook that escalate into face-to-face fatal violence. This occured in April when best friends Jordan Means, 16, pictured left, and Anthony Bankhead, 18, pictured right, were both found shot dead in an apartment basement in Chicago after a Facebook exchange . Experts believe they use Facebook as a way of demonstrating their control over the victim and the situation. LaShanda Armstrong is an example of an informer after she asked for forgiveness on her Facebook page following an argument with her partner. Shortly after, she drove into the Hudson river, killing herself and her three children. She wrote: 'I'm sorry everyone forgive me please for what I'm gonna do … This is it!!!' Reactor - (27.1 per cent of Facebook murders) A reactor responds to content posted on Facebook by attacking the victim face-to-face. This may be immediately after viewing the content that makes them angry or there may be a time delay in which they revisit the content and ruminate over its meaning. Informer - (22.9 per cent of Facebook murders) Uses Facebook to inform others that they intend to kill the victim, that they have killed the victim, or both. Informers use Facebook as a way of demonstrating their control over the victim and the situation. Antagonist - (16.7 per cent of Facebook murders) An antagonist engages in hostile exchanges on Facebook that escalate into face-to-face fatal violence. Antagonists may seek to introduce a physical advantage when the conflict goes offline through arming themselves with weapons. Fantasist - (12.5 per cent of Facebook murders) These type of murderers use Facebook to perform or indulge in a fantasy. For fantasists, the line between fantasy and reality has become increasingly blurred and the homicide may be a way of maintaining the fantasy or preventing others from discovering the deception. Predator - (12.5 per cent of Facebook murders) Creates and maintains a fake profile to lure a victim and meet them offline. May draw upon the information available on the victim's profile to identify and exploit vulnerabilities to establish grounds upon which to develop a relationship. Imposter - (8.3 per cent of Facebook murders) Posts in the name of someone else. This could be the victim in order to create the illusion they are still alive or another person to gain access to and monitor the victim's profile. An antagonist engages in hostile exchanges on Facebook that escalate into face-to-face fatal violence. They often try to gain a physical advantage when the conflict goes offline through arming themselves with weapons. This occurred in April when two teenage boys in Chicago were shot dead after getting into an argument on Facebook over a stolen powercord. Best friends Jordan Means, 16, and Anthony Bankhead, 18, were found dead in an apartment basement. LaShanda Armstrong (left) is an example of an informer after she asked for forgiveness on her Facebook page following an argument with her partner (right) At the time, Jordan's mother, Camille Cochran, claimed her son had got into an argument with his killer just the night before on the social network. For fantasists, the line between make believe and reality becomes blurred and murder may be a way of maintaining the fantasy or preventing others from discovering the deception. Meanwhile, a predator creates and maintains a fake profile to lure a victim and meet them offline; and an imposter posts in the name of someone else. This could be the victim in order to create the illusion they are still alive or another person to gain access to and monitor the victim's profile. Dr Elizabeth Yardley and Professor David Wilson from Birmingham University looked at examples from across the world. The study found that 26 out of the 48 Facebook murders had occurred in Britain. Scientists wanted to see whether murders in which Facebook was reported to have been involved were different to other homicides such as the recently committed by British banker Rurik Jutting (pictured left) Dr Yardley said she wanted to see whether murders in which Facebook was reported to have been involved were any different to other homicides. They found that that victims knew their killers in most cases, and the crimes echoed what we already know about this type of crime. However, they did find that the age profile of victims relatively low, the proportion of murder-suicides as high and women were over-represented as victims. Dr Yardley urged that social networking sites should not be blamed for these crimes. 'Social networking sites like Facebook have become part and parcel of our everyday lives and it's important to stress that there is nothing inherently bad about them. 'Facebook is no more to blame for these homicides than a knife is to blame for a stabbing – it's the intentions of the people using these tools that we need to focus upon.'","Reactor is most common type of killer responsible for 27.1% of murders .

"Separated: Woody Allen with Dylan Farrow. Despite the case being thrown out he was not allowed to see her again . Woody Allen has reacted with outrage after his daughter Dylan Farrow penned an open letter describing how she was allegedly sexually assaulted by the director when she was seven-year-old. The young woman yesterday penned an open letter, published on Nicholas Kristof's blog for The New York Times. Allen's attorney Elkan Abramowitz hit . out at the renewed allegations, today pointing the finger at Mia Farrow . for the latest scandal. 'It . is tragic that after 20 years a story engineered by a vengeful lover . (Mia Farrow) resurfaces after it was fully vetted and rejected by . independent authorities,' he said in a statement to Mother Jones. 'The one to blame for Dylan's distress is neither Dylan nor Woody Allen.' While . Allen, who has consistently denied the allegations, has yet to personally respond publicly, his . publicist Leslee Dart today said the director 'read the article and . found it untrue and disgraceful'. 'He will be responding very soon...At the time, a thorough investigation was conducted by court appointed independent experts,' Dart said in a statement to Mother Jones. 'The . experts concluded there was no credible evidence of molestation; that . Dylan Farrow had an inability to distinguish between fantasy and . reality; and that Dylan Farrow had likely been coached by her mother Mia . Farrow. No charges were ever filed.' Family scandal: Soon-Yi Previn and Woody Allen made their ways to their vehicles on Monday as heavy snow fell in New York City . Winter snow: Woody and Soon-Yi's adopted daughter Manzie Allen headed to school on Monday all bundled up . Dylan Farrow thanked the public for their support after breaking her silence on the sexual abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her adopted father Woody Allen, as the director's lawyer accused Dylan's 'vengeful' mother Mia Farrow of 'engineering' the sensational claims. 'She's really heartened by the response and support she's getting,' Kristof, reportedly a friend Mia Farrow and her son Ronan Farrow, told PEOPLE. 'She sends a big thank you to all those speaking up about sexual abuse and trying to break the silence.' However Dylan Farrow, now living in Florida and using a different name, has not escaped criticism. Some commentators have accused the 28-year-old, who also goes by the name Malone Farrow, of cynically timing her accusations to thwart her former adoptive father's chances of winning an Oscar for his critically acclaimed film Blue Jasmine. Family: Dylan Farrow, who now lives under another name and lives in Florida, pictured with her husband on September 15, 2012 . Break up: Dylan Farrow with her parents Mia Farrow and Allen in 1987. The filmmaker claims his ex-partner coached their daughter into accusing him of abuse . Unsettling allegations: Farrow, seen left with Allen in Italy in 1991, and with her mother and sister in 1992 (right), wrote how the director would stick his thumb in her mouth, force her to get in bed with him and place his head in her naked lap . Public break-up: Around the time this picture of Allen, Farrow, little Dylan and her brother Ronan was taken in 1992, the actress and filmmaker split following the revelations of sexual abuse . Dylan Farrow's first-person account . marked first time she directly addressed the alleged sex abuse which was . said to have occurred in the 1990s. In . gut-wrenching detail, Dylan Farrow wrote in her statement how at age . seven, her adoptive father, Allen, allegedly led her by the hand to a . dim attic on the second floor of their house. 'He told me to lay on my stomach and . play with my brother’s electric train set,' Dylan Farrow recounted. 'Then . he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering . that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we’d go . to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies.' She noted that to this day, she finds it hard to look at toy trains. Farrow . went on to describe how the award-winning director of 'Annie Hall' and . 'Manhattan' would always find a way to touch her and do things to her . she did not like, including sticking his thumb in her mouth, forcing her . to get into bed with him and placing his head in her naked lap. 'I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters. But what he did to me in the attic felt different,' she said. Unable to keep her alleged encounters . with her father secret anymore, young Dylan went to her mother, asking . her if her own father used to do the same things to her that Allen was . doing. The girl's . explosive allegations put an end to Farrow and Allen's relationship in . 1992, setting off a legal battle in which Dylan claimed the filmmaker . accused his former girlfriend of brainwashing her daughter into thinking . that he had assaulted her. What followed next was a drawn-out process in which Dylan was dragged from one psychologist to the next, recounting her story over and over again to see if she was lying. In the end, Allen was denied visitation rights with his children, but a Connecicut prosecutor declined to charge him, saying that while there was enough evidence for the case to potentially stand up in court, he was dropping criminal proceedings due to Dylan's fragile state. Allen, 78, has always denied the . allegations of sexual abuse. He was . never charged with, or convicted of, a crime in this case.

Keeping a low profile: Allen was accompanied by a retinue of people, but he sought to avoid drawing attention to himself . Hoops fan: Filmmaker Woody Allen, left, leaves late in the fourth quarter of an NBA basketball game between the Miami Heat and the New York Knicks Saturday . Shorlty after Allen and Farrow's split, it was revealed that the filmmaker began . an affair with his adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, whom he married in . 1997. On Saturday . night, just hours after the release of his daughter's bombshell letter, a . somber-looking Allen was spotted arriving at a New York Knicks game in . New York with two of his other adopted daughters in tow. In her open letter, . Dylan Farrow claimed that Allen used his ‘sexual relationship’ with her . stepsister, Soon-Yi, to cover up the abuse Dylan herself had allegedly . suffered at his hands. ‘That . he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up,’ Miss . Farrow wrote. ‘I was stricken with guilt that I had allowed him to be . near other little girls.’ Dylan . candidly talked about the effect the alleged ordeal had on her . later life, including a battle with eating disorders and her terror at . being touched by men. The woman also said she began cutting herself. His other girls: Woody Allen exits Madison Square Garden with adopted daughters Bechet Allen and Manzie Allen after watching the New York Knicks lose to the Miami Heat . Scandalous relationship: Dylan Farrow accused her father of using his affair with his adopted daughter Soon-Yi, right, to cover up his abuse of her; the two married in 1997 . Farrow also used her soul-baring . confession to attack the Hollywood establishment for 'turning a blind . eye' and helping along Allen’s career in the entertainment industry. ‘Most . found it easier to accept the ambiguity, to say, “who can say what . happened,” to pretend that nothing was wrong,’ she said. ‘Actors praised . him at awards shows. Networks put him on TV. Critics put him in . magazines. Final straw: Dylan explained that what prompted her to write the open letter was seeing her adopted father receiving yet another Oscar nomination for his latest film, Blue Jasmine . ‘Each time I saw my abuser’s face – . on a poster, on a t-shirt, on television – I could only hide my panic . until I found a place to be alone and fall apart.’ Dylan . Farrow's decision to offer a first-person account of her torment has . been spurred by Allen's latest nomination for an Academy Award and last . month’s Golden Globes ceremony, where he received the prestigious Cecil B . DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award. ‘It felt like a personal rebuke, like the awards and accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away,’ Dylan wrote. Farrow, . who described herself as a happily married woman, did not shy away from . condemning the actors who have starred in her father’s films over the . years, some of whom were on hand January 12 to present Allen with his . Golden Globe. ‘What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?’ she asked. Farrow's family, including her mother and stepbrother Ronan Farrow, have been unwavering in their support of her. On the night of the Golden Globes ceremony, Ronan Farrow, Allen's would-be son, brought up his sister's alleged assault in a scathing tweet. Support system: Both Dylan's mother, actress and activist Mia Farrow (left), and her adopted brother Ronan Farrow (right), have stood by her claims regarding Woody Allen . Strong words: Woody's son and ex-girlfriend weren't happy about him receiving an honour at the Golden Globes . ‘Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?’ the newly hired MSNBC host wrote. Dylan Farrow concluded her letter with an appeal to the movie-going public to think twice before they rush to heap praise on her talented adoptive father. ‘So imagine your seven-year-old daughter being led into an attic by Woody Allen. Imagine she spends a lifetime stricken with nausea at the mention of his name. Imagine a world that celebrates her tormenter. ‘Are you imagining that? Now, what’s your favorite Woody Allen movie?’ Shaming stars: Dylan lambasted actors like Diane Keaton and Alec Baldwin who had starred in her father's film; Keaton was on hand last month to present Allen with a lifetime achievement award .","Dylan Farrow wrote that Allen sexually assaulted her for first time as she lay staring at a toy train set when she was seven .

"Pilot forced to head back to Stansted 20 minutes in to 1,000-mile flight to Riga, Latvia . Comes as company outlines ambitious plan to double number of passengers . Passengers with Ryanair have long been accustomed to the airline cutting financial corners. But when one party found ground crews applying sticky tape to a cockpit window, they feared the penny-pinching had gone too far. Twenty minutes after take-off, the service from Stansted airport to Riga in Latvia was forced to turn back when the patch came loose and started making a ‘loud’ noise. Running repairs: Airport staff work on the Boeing's cockpit using duck-tape . Ryanair has insisted safety was never at risk, but passengers said they were in fear of their lives. Anthony Neal, 33, from Bromley, Kent, who was with a group of friends for his stag party, said: ‘They were taping up the front window as we were queueing to get on. ‘One guy was up a ladder and another was hanging out of a side window of the cockpit. ‘About 20 minutes into the flight the pilot came on the loudspeaker and said there was a problem with the windscreen – that it had been damaged on a previous flight and they’d have to turn back to Stansted.  People were terrified.’ The Boeing 737-800 took off on the evening of September 29 with around 200 passengers. A replacement plane was found after two hours . The Irish Aviation Authority has investigated the incident and said the tape was used to provide  protection to sealant on a new  window, adding: ‘At no time was passenger safety threatened.’ Before the 1,000-mile flight from . Stansted, Essex, to Riga in Latvia ground crew had been called out to . wrap the edge of the windscreen with the tape . The incident comes as the Micheal . O'Leary, chief executive of the airline, today outlined ambitious . expansion plans that would see it almost double the number of passengers . and stretch its reach across Europe. Mr O'Leary told the Financial Times . that he wanted to increase passenger numbers to between 120million and . 130million over the next decade - which would make Ryanair one of the . biggest airlines in the world. Controversial: The incident comes as the Micheal O'Leary, chief executive of the airline, outlined ambitious expansion plans that would see it almost double the number of passengers and stretch its reach across Europe .

Dublin-based Ryanair carried . 72.1million passengers in 2010/11 but the plans could double the size of . its fleet of about 270 aircraft.

"The dog dumped at a Tennessee animal shelter to be destroyed because his owner thought it was gay has been saved at the last minute by a kindhearted animal lover. After the the plight of the American Bulldog mix was seen by millions online, Stephanie Fryns, a veterinary technician from Jackson, stepped up this afternoon and adopted him from Jackson TN Euthanasia. Naming him Elton, Fryns, who already owns four dogs said that she had planned to rescue him even before his story had traveled around the Internet. Now safely with a new owner - Elton the dog is pictured in his pen at an animal shelter where he was being threatened with destruction because his owner thought he was gay . Describing the 50 pound dog as 'pretty friendly', Fryn said, 'He's pretty scared of everything, which is understandable. But he loved the car ride.' She said she suspected that Elton had been involved in illegal dog-fights, but that it was impossible to confirm. However he did have some redness on his ears. Fryn doubted he had been used routinely in dog fights because of his 'submissive' nature. The last minute reprieve for Elton came with only hours to go until he was scheduled to be euthanized at the Tennessee animal shelter. Animal lover Stephanie Fryns has rescued Elton the dog from the animal shelter were he was scheduled to be gassed . New brothers: Stephanie already has four dogs of her own at her home in Jackson . He was dumped there because according to the owner of the shelter, the dog's master noticed him 'hunched over' another male dog, which led him to assume he was gay. Yesterday a Facebook user became of aware of his plight after seeing his picture on the shelter's timeline and contacted Jackson TN Euthanasia to discover the reason why he had been left there to be destroyed. 'His owner threw him away bc he refuses to have a 'gay' dog!' wrote a user who calls herself 'Jackson Madison Rabies Control Stalker'. 'Don't let this gorgeous dog die [because] his owner is ignorant of normal dog behavior! He's in kennel 10L and he WILL be put down tomorrow bc there is no room at the inn!' Following an outcry over the Internet numerous people including Stephanie Fryns arrived at the shelter this morning to adopt the unloved dog. The Facebook page which started the outcry: Posted to their timeline Jackson TN Euthanasia explained why the dog was with them to be destroyed . Updating Facebook this morning, she said, 'I have talked to them..they know and will let me in at open.' 'I can’t understand it,' said one shelter worker, who declined to give his name. 'You know those dogs get on top of each other sometimes.' 'I have had about 10 million calls this morning. It has been adopted already. It is gone,' he said. 'He’s in good hands.' While dogs are known to occasionally display homosexual behaviour, animal experts say a male dog mounting another male dog is not a sign of sexual orientation but rather a sign of dominance. Two male penguins cuddle at the Bremerhaven zoo, in Germany. While a male dog mounting another male dog is not considered conclusive evidence of homosexuality, biologists have recorded same-sex sexual activity in more than 450 species including flamingos, bison, beetles and warthogs. A 2010 study of Alaskan Albatrosses found that a third of the pairs actually consisted of two females. Research also shows around a fifth of all king penguin couples kept in captivity are gay. Gay-rights campaigners have seized on evidence of animal homosexuality as proof that same-sex couples are a natural occurrence. In his book, Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality And Natural Diversity, Bruce Bagemihl  argues against 'heterosexist bias', where researchers presume animals are heterosexual. He claims homosexual behavior has been observed in 1,500 species, and well-documented in 500 of these.","American bulldog mix faced being destroyed today unless new owner is found .
